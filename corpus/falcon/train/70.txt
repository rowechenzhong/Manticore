If you're travelling into or around the capital next week, prepare for a rough commute - London Underground workers are set to strike again next week as part of the long running dispute over ticket office closures.
Strike action starts at 9pm on Tuesday 14th October and runs for 48hrs, enough time to really piss off workers and those reliant on The Tube right before the weekend.
Octobers planned strikes are the latest walkout in RMT’s "Every Job Matters" campaign. Recent talks between the union and London Underground have fallen flat and whilst the union said small amounts of progress had been made, it clearly wasn't enough to satisfy RMT's executives after months and months of negotiations and meeting room fun.
Aside from the loss of all ticket offices and over 750 jobs by 2015, RMT's Mick Cash said that the closures and staff loss would "render the tube a no-go zone for many people with disabilities and for women travelling alone".
Not patronising at all.

Credit: OnobelloI put the pads on when I was 9 years old and would have played football in high school if I'd been eligible. I appreciate the game. The excitement of it. The intensity of the battles. The drama of a tight 4th quarter. And the way it tests young men's strength, will, and determination in their struggle against pain and gravity and aggression. I appreciate the coaching battles. The strategic nuances. And I appreciate football's place in our culture -- the Friday battles of high school, the Saturday showdowns in the NCAA, and the Sunday clashes of the NFL. Wars fought on grass and turf. School against school. City against city. Wars in which no one has to die -- except that people are dying from playing football, a relatively small number during the game and many not so long after years of playing, more of them than we used to realize -- enough to make me relieved that I wasn't eligible to play for my high school.
A number of recent articles, books, and television documentaries (including the recent, PBS Frontline, League of Denial have shined the spotlight on new research about head trauma and brain injuries and the toll taken on the lives of the boys and men who play football. The tragic stories of Junior Seau, Mike Webster, and others stand in for lesser known football players who suffer and often die prematurely in silence.
Not all scientists agree with the research and the NFL has been slow to acknowledge the extent of the dangers of its game, but there is enough evidence for at least parents and educators to be concerned.
And I cannot help wondering about high school football. I mean, should there even be high school football?
Just asking that question is probably an affront to players and their fans at every level. But I'm asking because the question needs to be asked.
Because don't we put student safety above all else?
It's why we take even the slightest threat of violence so seriously.
It's why we confiscate weapons and punish or expel those who carry them on campus.
It's why we try to make our high school campuses drug and alcohol free.
It's why we have prom buses and Grad Night and take other measures to keep our students from driving each other around drunk.
It's why we don't (or shouldn't, anyway) tolerate bullying.
Why we take our students' emotional health -- and any of their suicidal thoughts -- so seriously.
It's why, here in California, the earthquake safety standards for new school construction are so stringent.
It's why, as a matter of fact, high school athletic authorities require football pads and helmets to meet and be maintained to a high standard. It's why we have medics at football games. It's why we now have rules about how soon young men can play after a concussion and why many football coaches are required to be educated about concussions.
But new evidence suggests that so-called "sub-concussive" head trauma can also be destructive to mental health. And even if that evidence is less than conclusive -- and I'm not saying it isn't conclusive -- don't we usually err on the side of caution where our children are concerned? For example, if we think that maybe one of our students is the victim of child abuse we are required by law to call the authorities. If we think that maybe a student has brought a weapon to school, we search that student. If there is a shooting five blocks from our school, we're probably going to have a lockdown.
This troubles? But it also troubles me because I understand the value of high school sports -- as motivating and character-building and community-building activities. I understand that in the part of Los Angeles where I teach and coach, high school football is, among other things, a gang-prevention program.
So if lives are at stake from the risks of football then they may also be at stake if high schools stop playing it.
And, yes, there are injuries in almost all sports but in every other high school sports the serious injuries are accidents and mishaps. In football, head-to-head combat -- and all the short- and long-term consequences -- are a natural part of the game played the way it is intended to be played. Leading with one's head is effective. It is cheered. And, according to what neuro-scientists are now saying, it is potentially and ultimately deadly.
Perhaps the game of football in general and high school football in particular can be made safer. Perhaps it already has been -- with all the elevated awareness about concussions and head-trauma -- but I don't believe anyone can say, with certainty, that we are not putting all those young men playing the sport at risk. We really don't know if the game is just inherently too violent.
The National Football League may never sincerely act in the long-term interests of its players, all of whom are consenting adults (though they all started playing long before they were). But high schools -- many of which prohibit skateboarding on campus for safety reasons! -- have a moral obligation to put student safety above all other considerations.
If playing football has a high risk of long-term permanent brain damage, how can any education institutions -- high school or, for that matter, college -- allow its students, whose minds have been entrusted to us, to subject themselves to such damage in the name of those institutions?

posted:
Entec first started working with Portishead through their previous lighting designer Tony Austin, who also originally asked current LD Niall Hannell to come on-board, initially as a programmer in April 2008. Niall took over as LD last year.
This summer Entec supplied a floor specials, control and WYSIWYG package to Portishead’s three latest high profile shows at Montreux Jazz, Benicassim in Spain and Latitude festival in the UK along with a surprise bijou show at Cardiff University.
The whole rig was a really tight design based around the innovative cinematographic work of video director John Minton. The band like it dark, stark and contrasty, a lighting aesthetic ideally suited to the overall look and feel they wanted to evoke, and the rig was also designed to be as simple and practical as possible.
Many of the specific video treatments were produced using feedback and luma key effects for which the light needed to be just right.
Six washes and six spot luminaires on the deck formed the core of the touring lighting rig, with a first choice being Martin MAC Vipers and Robe LEDWash 600s - all easily integratable into the overhead lighting packages provided by the venue, for which 16 spot and 16 wash moving lights were requested.
Entec further provided 12 x 650 Watt fresnels and a miscellany of grip accessories, magic arms, stands, clamps, etc. that could be assembled around the band’s backline, fitting in virtually anywhere. These provided excellent key lighting for the various cameras, so whatever the angle, there was a good – or an idiosyncratic - image onscreen.
There was a large upstage LED screen and John utilised 10 cameras in his mix, a combination of fully operated, robo-cams and mini-cams, all fed into two big black boxes … out of which he produced his wizardry!
There were also a number of quirky gizmos like mirrors attached to speakers connected to bass pedals, etc., dotted around, all bringing the stage action really alive onscreen and across to the audience. Everyone could literally feel the movement – almost breathing - from the instruments and music.
Niall toured a grandMA2 light console for control with a Wing for backup, also supplied by Entec. The handy size of the Wing meant he could use it for focusing onstage at the festivals.
Niall has been working with Entec for around 15 years as a freelance and now as a client and comments, “It’s an absolutely wonderful, very friendly and efficient company. The service is excellent – nothing is too much trouble and it doesn’t matter what size of rig you’re taking out, everyone enjoys the same impressive standards”.
He observes that as Entec also enjoys a good relationship with other hire companies, cross renting items as needed is rarely a problem.
“They are always there for you and the whole team really cares about every aspect of a project with which they are involved”.
Entec Project Manager Noreen O’Riordan says, “It really is a pleasure to work with all involved in Portishead including production manager Mick Brown. They are a tightknit team of creative professionals who have a lot of fun along the way, and we look forward to working with them all again soon”.The Light Gate Scan is a new instrument to analyze such phenomenon. The weak magnetic frequency and energy of the human body are collected by holding the sensor, and after amplification by the instrument and treatment by the built-in micro-processor, the data is compared with the standard spectrum of diseases, nutrition and other indicators incorporated within the instrument to judge whether the sample waveforms are irregular using the Fourier principle approach. Analysis and judgment can thus be made on health condition and main problems of the testee based on the result of waveform analysis, as well as standard protective and curative proposals.

Mungo Brush Road Relocation
The NSW Office of Environment & Heritage is reviewing environmental factors for the Mungo Brush Road relocation, Myall Lakes National Park.
Mungo Brush Road is the main vehicle access into Myall Lakes National Park. The road is expected to be impacted by the Dark Point sand dunes within two years, so the Office is proposing to relocate the road.

We live in a time when any conversation on energy access invariable begins with gigawatts and megawatts and millions of people. Being on the field as a part of SELCO’s induction gave an insight into what a few watts mean for one poor rural household at a time. In Puttur, a 40 watt panel powers two LED lights has been helping women roll tobacco at night – a common occupation in the region. The additional income generated not only pays for the entire system and make it their asset, but also creates increased disposable income. In Manipal, a migrant worker community entrepreneur charges 25 batteries and rents it out every night for a small price to his neighbors to power their lights. Again, he makes enough to pay for the system and invest in more.
The immediate impacts of a decentralized energy intervention and financial linkage becomes clear with one visit to such communities. The opportunity costs of livelihood creation hardly gets captured in various plans for 2020, 2030 and so on that place their bet on high capital investments and grid extensions. Asset creation is a critical step towards poverty alleviation, and DRE interventions can facilitate that change today. Not five years from now.
Women go to the fields to work during the day, and find time to roll tobacco only at night when all other work is done. A solar light enables them to earn 800 to 1,000 rupees per week.
This house in Puttur was one of the beneficiaries of the Bhagyajyothi Scheme, through which the state government gives grid connection to power one light. The woman here was explaining how unreliable that power is, and how they rely more on the solar lights instead.
In this IEC (Integrated Energy Center), a solar panel charges small batteries in a community store in Manipal. Households who own a led light (purchased for a nominal amount) pay the entrepreneur to get their batteries charged during the day. His list of customers can be seen on the board.
A decade ago, one of the big challenges around solar technologies was to create awareness among people. Now, anyone can go to the closest town, get a cheap solar panel and install it themselves. Here is one such house in a migrant community near Belgaum.South African's protested outside the Burmese Embassy. Watch police fire stun grenades as things get violent in Pretoria.Read More »

3. Can you require an employee to work at home? Generally, yes. However, you don’t want to create “precedent” under the ADA to suggest that working at home is a viable option as a general rule. Document that this is “unique” situation and that allowing an employee to work at home does not mean the employee generally can perform the essential functions of his or her job at home. Additional considerations include confirming whether your workers compensation coverage covers work from home arrangements mandated by the employer and that you have sufficient IT support to handle system demand and the protection of your organization’s confidential information. The benefit of a a few hours working from home may be outweighed by the risk of a security breach if employees send files to their home computers in order to have access Lots of nuances that go beyond this brief summary.
4. Can we make employees sleep on our premises or in the City knowing that they may not be able to get in and out of Philadelphia each day? The answer is generally “yes.” There may be legal exceptions, such as reasonable accommodations for medical reason. There also may be human reasons independent of the law, such as a single parent with no one else to take care of child.
5. Do you have to pay the non-exempt employee if you require that he or she stays on your premises? Under federal law, the answer is “yes.” However, there are limited exceptions under federal law for sleeping and certain other time. Please note there are not comparable exceptions under Pennsylvania law. General rule in Pennsylvania: you must pay for the entire time you require an employee to be on your premises. So be thoughtful on how much time you require a non-exempt to be on your premises and make clear freedom to do what and where they want outside of designated sleeping hours.
6. Do I have to pay non-exempt employees if I offer them the option to stay at a hotel in or near town at company’s pay but it is not a requirement? The answer should be “no” if you are clear that this is being offered solely for the convenience of the employee and there are no restrictions on when or where the employee must be at any time.
7. Do I have to pay non-exempt employees if I mandate that they stay at a hotel in or near town? The answer here is less clear. Although not absolute, a strong argument can be made that you have to pay only “extra” commute time (that is, checking in and out of hotel on first and last day). No matter what: make clear the employee is free to come and go and do what he or she wants, except for a limited number of sleeping hours.
8. What about union employees? Can we change the rules under the collective bargaining agreement (“CBA’) during the Pope’s visit? Where possible, try to work with the union as a business partner. If not, you will need to assess whether you can make changes to the CBA without the union’s agreement. Of course, every change differs but the answer is generally that, if CBA is on point, you cannot act inconsistently with it without union’s agreement.
9. What if an employee objects for religious reasons to working on any event you may plan for the celebration? Now, you have a different version of, the “Kentucky clerk.” You may need to consider allowing the employee to opt out due to sincerely held religious beliefs. But what if the employee’s job is special events? In other words, can an employee opt out of an aspect of the employee’s essential function? Answer: not entirely clear. It may depend on frequency. Compare the one-time nature of this event with relatively-more frequency of same-sex marriages in Kentucky.

I am a professional journalist with international experience. I speak fluent Japanese and English. I graduated from Ca ‘Foscari University of Venice in Japanese Language and Literature. I lived in Tokyo for about ten years but now I live and work in Milan. On November 25, 2016, I received the Umberto Agnelli Prize for Journalism, awarded each year by the Italy-Japan Foundation to journalists who distinguish themselves in communicating Japan to Italy and Italy to Japan.
I write about society, current affairs, culture, food, fashion, design and lifestyle in relation to contemporary Japan for national and international publications. My articles appeared in La Repubblica, Il Messaggero, Repubblica.it, D la Repubblica delle Donne, L’Espresso, Limes, GQ, Casa Vogue, Vanity Fair, The Japan Times, East and others. A selection of my publications is available on my website. I am Vice Director of ArteCibo the international website, edited by Verona’s publishing house “l’Informatore Agrario”.
On October 20, 2016, Edizioni Gribaudo published “The Traditional Sushi”, book that concludes my personal trilogy dedicated to sushi, flat symbol of Japanese culinary culture. The trilogy I edited includes also “The Sushi”, published in 2013 and released with the DVD “Jiro and the Art of Sushi” for the Real Cinema Feltrinelli series; “The Art of Sushi,” published in June 2015 by Gribaudo Editions as an enhanced and illustrated edition of “The Sushi”. “The Art of Sushi” collects unpublished essays written by important names of Italian journalism and by experts on sushi. In November, 2017, “The Ramen Book” was published by Edizioni Gribaudo, expanding my book series about japanese culinary culture.
In October 2016, on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of diplomatic relations between Italy and Japan, I edited and presented “Japan Talks, understanding Japan”, four meetings about Japanese design, tourism, literature and food, part of the Beautiful Rising Sun project, organized by Mondadori in the Mondadori store in Piazza Duomo in Milan. During Expo 2015, I had the honor of presenting some major international events such as “the Umami Summit in Milan” sponsored by the Ajinomoto company and JJS event (Sake and Shochu Association).
Besides Publishing activities, I work also in the fields of communication consultancy, press and PR office for companies and enterprises, especially in Italy and Japan. I have been the responsible for communication for the Milan Manga Festival and I am in charge of the press office for events in collaboration with institutions such as the ICCJ – Italian Chamber of Commerce in Japan, international media agencies as Asatsu-DK or Daiko, or Japanese prefectures.
During my stay in Japan, I created and directed the cultural video program “+8, Tales from Tokyo” for Repubblica TV. From 2008 to 2010, I was the editor for the Japanese magazine “Amarena”, Fusosha Co.Ltd. In 2007, I worked as Press Office for the Embassy of Italy in Tokyo for the project Italian Spring. In 2005, I won the scholarship for journalists of the Italian Chamber of Commerce in Japan (ICCJ), where I was in charge for the press office and communication and the editorial office of the magazine “Viste” from the Chamber. Before starting the journalistic career, I worked in the fashion world for Max Mara, in Italy and in Japan. I won a scholarship in international marketing of the CPV (Veneto Production Center) and worked for Diesel and Gucci.Flush Mounted Lighting!

He had been in the publishing business most of his adult life—as a newspaper reporter and photographer, selling ads for the paper, writing his own column, editing and writing for various outdoor magazines; and finally editing and publishing his own magazines. He knew something about the world of publishing.
He came to me in 1998 and suggested the family pool its efforts and create our own publishing company. I forget how he phrased it. Knowing my dad, it was probably a gentle suggestion, just something he had been thinking about and wanted to get some feedback on. I thought it was a great idea.
And being the person that I am, I immediately set about suggesting all sorts of stuff we could publish, and possible names for the company. Which is how we arrived at Stark House Press, and our first book, a collection of stories by Storm Constantine. My ex-wife and I ran an import company called Firebird Distributing LLC during the 1990s, specializing in importing British books and selling them to U.S. dealers and collectors. One of the authors we imported—and quite successfully—was Storm Constantine.
I fell in love with Constantine’s baroque fantasies which mixed sex, religion and adventure with a dash of stylish pop culture to create a world all her own. My favorite book at the time was Burying the Shadow, a subtle vampire tale that never once mentions the word “vampire.” I felt that Storm was the Goth Queen, and I campaigned heavily for her with the Stark House family.
I contacted Storm, and she was agreeable. More than agreeable, she was a pleasure to work with. She hadn’t had any of her standalone books published in the U.S. at the time, and was only known for the Wraeththu Trilogy, a gender-bending science fiction series that started her career. Rather than reprinting one of her novels, I wanted to start with something totally original in a signed, numbered hardback edition. The result was The Oracle Lips: A Collection.
We discovered right away that we had to print quite a lot of them to get a decent price break, so we pooled our monies and jumped in with a thousand-copy print run … all gamely signed by Storm and numbered by us. If we had any idea of what we were doing, we would have published about five hundred copies. The book got a few tentatively good reviews (as I recalled, the Locus critic felt it was a bit uneven, and perhaps it was considering that none of us novices wanted to reject any of Storm’s submissions), and it sold fairly well initially.
But I still have several boxes of the book. Until his death in 2012, my dad always kept five boxes in his garage as well. I never knew whether he kept the boxes a reminder of our hubris, or in pride of accomplishment. He was too tactful to say.
However, after The Oracle Lips was published and didn’t sell like the hotcakes we expected—ie, after we all failed to make our investment back—my parents backed off the project. I suggested more books, but my dad could always think of a reason why he didn’t feel that investing more money in a project that wasn’t likely to make any money was a good idea. A noble endeavor, but no thank you, my son.
The Oracle Lips was published in early 1999. It took me two years to publish another book. I suggested to the family that if they didn’t mind I would simply borrow the company for a quick side project, and I went back to Storm to reprint two of her standalone novels, and another collection of stories. You can’t keep a good man down. Or perhaps you simply can’t stop stubborn. At any rate, I continued Stark House as a side project, adding some Algernon Blackwood books to my list. As long as I wanted to invest my own money in the project, the family didn’t mind.
My brother, the art director, took another approach. He stayed on board, but he asked to be paid for each book. Smart man. I couldn’t have continued the company without him.
Once I decided to start reprinting older books, I initially hired someone to scan those Blackwood books for me—until I realized that I had to learn how to do that myself if I was going to make this company work. The family finally decided to give me their share of Stark House, and off I went, looking for more new projects.
Which is how I came to publish mysteries. Just as I had done with Storm Constantine, I simply went with what I enjoyed. I don’t tend to read a lot of new fiction, so reprinting older books suits me fine. You will notice that each year, more new authors appear on the list. This isn’t a carefully considered plan on my part to gradually change the face of Stark House back to its humble origins. No, I simply publish the books I enjoy reading. It’s just as simple as that. And I owe it all to my dad: Bill Shepard, the man with the plan, and editor supreme.

Pro-life investigators to turn themselves in: attorney
HOUSTON, January 26, 2016 (LifeSiteNews) – The investigators who exposed Planned Parenthood in a series of viral videos this summer plan to turn themselves in to authorities in Texas, their lawyer said today.
A Harris County, Texas, grand jury indicted David Daleiden and his associate Sandra Merritt on Monday on two charges that could bring them up to 20 years in prison.
“We will vigorously defend David through the discovery process and at trial,” Daleiden's attorney, Peter Breen of the Thomas More Society, told LifeSiteNews on Tuesday.
Both of the Center for Medical Progress investigators live in California but plan to go to Texas, where they will be charged and post bail according to another of Daleiden's attorneys, Murphy Klasing.
"The fact that our client has been indicted and Planned Parenthood was not is mind-blowing,” added Mat Staver of Liberty Counsel, who is representing Merritt.
"One of the prosecutors in the Houston office has been a board member for Planned Parenthood and has posted this fact on social media,” he added.
“Anyone who has watched Planned Parenthood employees sort through dismembered baby parts and heard the Planned Parenthood officials attempt to sell them knows that Planned Parenthood is the criminal, not our client," Staver concluded.First Full Day of Winter Brings Appropriate Weather
The National Weather Service says the Winter Weather Advisory for the Twin Tiers remains in effect until 7 p.m. December 22 with a possibility of a small accumulation of snow and a light glaze of ice with mixed precipitation.
Dave Nicosia of the Binghamton NOAA office says the amount of snow and ice is not expected to be major in the Greater Binghamton Area with a dusting of snow but locations to the north and east could get a little more, possibly up to five inches, depending on the location.

Events that took place at the Cinematheque on Wooster Street during the first half of 1968 included live performances. According to the chronology in Critical Mass: Happenings, Fluxus, Performance, Intermedia and Rutgers University 1958-1972, Herman Nitsch presented his Orgies-Mysteries Theatre (Actions 25 & 26) on 2 and 16 March. The production included Bibbe Hansen's father, the Fluxus artist Al Hansen, Jon Hendricks and Raphael Ortiz. (GH191) According to Roslyn Bernstein and Shael Shapiro in Illegal Living: 80 Wooster Street and the Evolution of Soho, Nitsch gave three performances in March at the Cinematheque.
Roslyn Bernstein and Shael Shapiro:
"When asked what events they remember from the Cinematheque, virtually everyone who was there (and some who were not), mentions Hermann Nitsch's butchering performance on view March 2, 16 and 17. Standing in front of a pile of sheep guts and animal organs, before the stunned eyes of a full house, Nitsch and other performers dived into the bloody mess. At one point, Jon Hendricks stuffed bloody brains into his pants and pulled them out again through his zipper. A 19-year old girl in a white dress lies down under a dangling bloody sheep and bloddy and wet intestines were placed on her private parts. Hendricks says that the performance was 'very cathartic.'" (RB95-96)
In April 1968, Richard Foreman's Ontological-Hysteric theatre group presented Angel Face. Although Wooster Street historians, Roslyn Bernstein and Shael Shapiro, give the impression that Foreman gave his first performance at the Cinematheque after it was closed down, Foreman's first production was in April which was prior to the Cinematheque's closure in late July.
Roslyn Bernstein & Shael Shapiro, Illegal Living: 80 Wooster Street and the Evolution of Soho (2010):
"When Cinematheque was closed down in mid-1968, Richard Foreman saw an opportunity. He asked Mekas for use of the vacant theater to rehearse and perform his plays. Mekas agreed, charging him no rent. Foreman opened his Ontological-Hysteric Theater with the premiere of his second play Angelface. It was held in Cinematheque at 80 Wooster Street, for four nights, April 9, 10, 11 and 14, 1968 before a slender audience of 10 to 20 people, some of whom walked out during the performance. This was the first Foreman play to be produced. To Foreman, the downtown venue, however unfinished, was a welcome and friendly space." (RB92)
Cast members included filmmakers Ken Kelman and Ernie Gehr while Michael Snow, of Wavelength fame, was the director.
On 5 May 1968, Philip Glass and Steve Reich performed at the Cinematheque. (RB97)
Roslyn Bernstein & Shael Shapiro:
"It was the first public concert of Philip Glass's new music, performed at Cinematheque in spring 1968. On the program were two of Glass's pieces, Music in the Shape of a Square for Two Flutes, performed by Philip Glass and Jon Gibson, Strung Out, performed by the violoinist Pixley-Rothschild, and Four Organs composed by Steve Reich, with Philip Glass, Arthur Murphy, Steve Chambers and Reich on the electric organ and with Jon Gibson playing the maracas. The avant-garde space was the perfect setting for this unconventional performance in which the Glass musical scores were tacked up on the wall and the performers were required to move while playing." (RB98)
Mekas was still advertising screenings at Wooster Street in early July 1968 (see below) but by the end of the month the Building Department would close the Wooster Street venue.
Village Voice ad, 4 July 1968
(courtesy of Alfredo Garcia, author of The Inevitable World of The
Velvet Underground Catalogue and site author of Warhol Film Ads)
The Wooster Street Cinematheque was closed down in late July 1968, about seven months after it had opened. In his round up of the year published in the 26 December 1968 issue of the Village Voice, Mekas wrote about July 1968: "New York police and the Building Department close the Film-Makers' Cinematheque and inaugurate a long slump in the New York avant-garde film viewing. For the rest of the year, it becomes impossible to see independently made films on any regular basis." (JM327) Mekas notes in "Showcases I Ran in the Sixties" that Wooster Street was used for screenings from "early 1968 to 30 July 1968" and was "closed by the police and Building Department 'to complete the licensing' of the theater." (DJ324)
Eventually, the FDC screenings at the 41st Theater (which, as we have already seen, had been renamed the 42nd Street Theater before becoming the New Cinema Playhouse) also ended. David E. James notes that "a combination of factors, including Warhol's decision to distribute his own work, the increasing appropriation of underground devices and subject matter by commercial films, and disapproval and factionalism with the purist wing of the avant-garde, confounded the project. He managed to reopen it in 1968, in what he hoped would be a permanent location in an artists' cooperative building at 80 Wooster Street. Police harassment ended these hopes, forcing it to temporary homes at the Methodist Church debts, the cinematheque ended too." (DJ12) (It's worth noting that the Gallery of Modern Art had nothing to do with the Museum of Modern Art. It was a private gallery owned by Huntington Hartford, as is shown below.)
Although the Film-Makers' Distribution Center had originally released Warhol's **** (Four Stars) and The Chelsea Girls, Warhol was increasingly using venues that were not associated with Mekas to show his films. During 1967 he screened a number of films at the Hudson Theater. My Hustler opened at the Hudson on 10 July 1967; I, A Man on 24 August and Bike Boy on 5 October 1967. (BCR/HTA/HT)During 1968 and 1969 Warhol used the New Andy Warhol Garrick Theater to show films such as Loves of Ondine (opened 1 August 1968); Flesh (opened September 1968); and Blue Movie (opened 21 July 1969). (FAW 31, 35, 37)
In "Showcases I Ran in the Sixties," in To Free the Cinema: Jonas Mekas &The New York Underground, Mekas names three venues used during 1968 after Wooster Street closed in July - the Methodist Church, the Bleecker St. Cinema and the Jewish Museum. He used the church for Monday only screenings from 1 to 25 August. The Bleecker Street Cinema was apparently used only on 25 August. Tuesday night screenings at the Jewish Museum began on 12 November 1968.
In his January 2, 1969 column, Mekas noted "The Cinematheque is still closed. The New York police still hold two screens, two projectors, one totally innocent film by Andy Warhol, and one totally innocent film by Jack Smith (not Flaming Creatures) that they seized almost four years ago and, mind, there was never a charge against these two films. But to get it all back from the police, the Cinematheque would have to sue the police and we have figured out that it would cost us more to sue the police than to buy two new projectors, two new screens, and to make two brand new films. That's justice for you. Fuck New York justice." (JM330)
The Jewish Museum
In the same issue of the Voice in which Mekas lamented that the Cinematheque was still closed, there was an ad for a Film-Makers' Cinematheque screening at the Jewish Museum:
Village Voice ad, 2 January 1969, p. 41
The Jewish Museum, the Elgin Theatre and the Gotham Art Theater
During 1969 Mekas' Mekas advertised Cinematheque screenings at three venues in the Voice -The Jewish Museum, the Elgin Theater, the Gotham Art Theater and the Gallery of Modern Art.
Village Voice ad, 6 February 1969
He noted some of the Cinematheque screenings in his round-up of the year, published in the 1 January 1970 issue of the Village Voice,
Jonas Mekas, "Movie Journal," Village Voice, 1 January 1970
Although Mekas identifies some of the screenings in his column as Cinematheque screenings, many of the other screenings he mentions were also originally advertised under the heading of "Film-Makers' Cinematheque." For instance, in the January section of his column he writes "Larry Jordan's Old House Passing premiered at the Jewish Museum." But we know from the ad reproduced above, from the 2 January 1969 issue of the Voice, that the Jordan screening was a presentation of the Film-Makers' Cinematheque but this was not mentioned by Mekas in his column.
In the February section he mentions films by Stan Brakhage premiering at the Elgin. As with the Larry Jordan screening, the original ad that included the screening was headed "Film-Makers' Cinematheque."
Village Voice ad, 20 February 1969
As noted earlier both the Gotham Art Theater and the Elgin Theater listed in the ad were two of the venues used by Mekas for his screenings in 1969. Mekas lists the Gotham Art Theater screenings as item 16 in his chronology, "Showcases I Ran in the Sixties:"
"16. Gotham Art Theater, West Forty-Third Street, 31 January to 28 February 1969. Weekend screenings. Temporary arrangement. Not thrown out!" (DJ324)
The Elgin Theater is listed as item 17:
"17. Elgin Theater, Eighth Avenue and West Nineteenth Street, 26 January to 23 March 1969. Sundays, 11:15 a.m. only - not the happiest time. Temporary arrangement." (DJ324)
The first mention of "Cinematheque" in Mekas' 1 January 1970 column is a reference to a screening of Robert Breer's 69 in April. The next time he refers specifically to the Cinematheque is in June when he notes that "Andy Warhol's Blue Movie" was "premiered by Cinematheque," and "Mike Jacobson first one man show, at Cinematheque." In August, he writes "Michael Stewart has his first one man show at Cinematheque." In September he writes "Kenneth Anger's Invocation of My Brother at Cinematheque. In December he lists a number of films such as Imitation of Christ by Warhol which were screened at a festival by the Cinematheque at the Elgin Theater, but he doesn't mention the Cinematheque in regard to these films in his column.
The Gallery of Modern Art
During at least part of this time, he was running a series of "Cinematheque in Exile" screenings at the Gallery of Modern Art at 2 Columbus Circle. As noted earlier, the gallery had nothing to do with the Museum of Modern Art. It was a private gallery owned by the philanthropist Huntington Hartford. The screenings at the gallery are the last ones listed by Mekas in "Showcases I Ran in the Sixties:"
"18. Gallery of Modern Art, Columbus Circle, 1 March to September 1969. Daily screenings (except Monday and Tuesday). Screenings stopped by me after a show of Stan Brakhage's Window Water Baby Moving, which the management of the gallery found obscene." (DJ324)
The first screenings at the gallery were listed in a "Film-Makers' Cinematheque in Exile" ad in the February 27th issue of the Voice:
Village Voice ad, 27 February 1969
Although Mekas writes in his chronology that the screenings at the Gallery of Modern Art lasted until September 1969, I have been unable to find ads for screenings at the gallery after May 1969. Mekas says he left the gallery because they found a Brakhage film "obscene." At the bottom of an ad from the 1 May 1969 issue of the Voice, he expresses his concern about the fact that the venue stopped the premiere of a Brakhage film, but doesn't indicate the title of the film.
Village Voice ad, 1 May 1969
The last ad that I found in the Voice for the screenings at the Gallery of Modern Art was in the 29 May issue which ended with the showing on June 1st of two films by Max Katz. On 16 March, the New York Times reported that 2 Columbus Circle was "up for grabs" and on the 16 July it reported that "Huntington Hartford's Museum is Given to Fairleigh Dickenson," with the new building to be called the New York Cultural Center.
The first issue of the Voice after 29 May was the 5 June issue. There is no mention of the Gallery. Instead there is a Film-Makers' Cinematheque ad for films by Mike Jacobson at the Jewish Museum and the premiere of "a new film by Andy Warhol" at the Elgin Theater.
Village Voice ad, 5 June 1969
The film was actually Blue Movie which, according to the ad, was being screened as a benefit for Film Culture magazine. The title of the film was left off the ad, possibly so as not to attract the attention of the censors. According to Popism the original title of the film was Fuck, but even the title of Blue Movie might have attracted attention that Mekas would have rather avoided. (POP294) Mekas quotes himself in the ad which he presumably paid for as the person behind the Film-makers' Cinematheque and does not mention that he is the publisher and editor of Film Culture.
Blue Movie was eventually seized at a screening for being pornographic, but not until about a month and a half later - on 31 July - by which time it was playing at the Andy Warhol Garrick Theatre.
The Village Voice, 5 June 1969, p. 39
Blue Movie was ruled obscene on 18 September and the theatre manager fined $250.00.
Although Blue Movie had been included in a Cinematheque ad, Warhol was distributing most of his own films by 1969. When Jonas Mekas was asked by Vincent Canby in an interview that appeared in the 24 May 1969 issue of The Morning Record, "Whom do you regard as the underground's most important filmmakers today," Mekas replied, "Andy Warhol, of course, even though he now is distribution most of his films himself..."
Other Cinematheque screenings at the Elgin included Kenneth Anger films in September:
Village Voice ad, 11 September 1969
In his January 1st round-up of screening highlights in 1969, most of the films he mentions were Cinematheque screenings but because he only identifies some of them as Cinematheque screenings, it makes the history of the Cinematheque confusing. Mekas might have been using the label of Cinematheque to give to the screenings a similar prestige as screenings at the famous Cinémathèque Française in Paris, but Mekas' Cinematheque did not have a stable home. They did not have their own venue during much of the '60s. The closest they came to a real Cinematheque was the short-lived Wooster Street location.
At the end of year, Mekas put on a film festival at the Elgin "arranged by Film-Makers' Cinematheque." He mentions some of the films in his January 1st column - such as Warhol's Imitation of Christ - but not where they were screened or that the screenings had to do with the Cinematheque (i.e. with him).

Hindustan Times.
United under the banner of the "Shaheed Bhagat Singh, Rajguru, Sukhdev Memorial Society”, the young organisers have found support from the local administration. The festival opened with Akhand Path at the historical Gurudwara Saragarhi. Virsa 2013 was the opening-night programme at Shaheed Bhagat Singh College of Engineering and Technology. It included folk and choreographed dances, skits, mimicry, solo and group dance, and singing competitons, besides a pageant to pick "Mr Punjabi" and "Miss Punjabi".
On Day Three, the hosts completed the Bhog of Akhand Path and organised a motorcycle and a seminar on the Hussainiwala memorial. Day four multiple games for young boys and girls while especially for Veteran too besides a great cultural show by various Folk Artists of the region enthralled the audience.On the fifth day, tehre were kabaddi events and on the final day, there was a blood donation camp at the martyrs' memorial in Hussianiwala on the martyrdom anniversary (March 23) of Shaheed Bhagat Singh, Rajguru, and Sukhdev.
Jaswinder Singh Sandhu, president of the organising body, paid tributes to the martyrs. "The job done is commendable," said Kamal Sharma, state president the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), who felicitated some athletes during the festival. A kilometre inside the Indian territory along the border with Pakistan at Hussianiwala in Ferozepur district, stands the memorials dedicated to Shaheed Bhagat Singh, Rajguru, and Sukhdev, where they were cremated after their execution in the Lahore jail (now in Pakistan) under the British imperial rule.
The area remained in Pakistani occupation until 1962 and was returned to India in exchange for 12 villages near Sulemanki (Fazilka) the same year. In the 1971 war, the Pakistan army took away the martyrs' statues that stood there and it has not returned the sculptures since.
Punjab ministers Bikram Singh Majithia, Surjit Kumar Jiyani, and KD Bhandari; chief parliamentary secretary Manjit Singh Narang, deputy commissioner Pritam Singh Johal; additional DC GS Pannu, and the subdivisional magistrate attended the festival and motivated the youth.

ITIJ 212, Air Ambulance Review, September 2018
Medical crews flying around the world to collect critically injured patients are subject to fatigue, So ensuring proper rest times for them is an essential part of a company’s duty of care. Tatum Anderson reports
It’s a long-distance flight between Bangkok and Paris on a CL604. A patient, perhaps under mechanical ventilation, is monitored by a physician. A member of the patient’s family accompanies the patient. A second member of the medical team is preparing hot dishes in an oven. Chances are the crew has flown into Bangkok from Paris to pick up the patient. Usually, while the flight crew is resting in Bangkok, the medical crew gets to work. “We manage three periods for our doctor and registered nurse team,” said Dr Hervé Raffin of French air ambulance firm Medic’Air International. “First, they go to see the patient, meet the local treating doctor and start treatment. Second, they make sure they get around four hours sleep in the nearest comfortable hotel. Lastly, they return to the hospital to take the patient on the road to the airport for boarding.” If the patient is unstable, there must be a very quick turnaround, Dr Raffin says: “For these acute patients, our target is to take off from Paris at a moment’s notice, even during the night, to project our ICU team to the patient’s bed in the shortest time possible.”
Dr Raffin says his company uses planes with wide cabins to help maximise crew and patient rest times. “For these long flights (12 to 24 hours), there must be room for one of the team to have real rest time on board when the two others are monitoring the patient,” he said. Such an aircraft has toilets, a galley with an oven to eat hot meals at any time and space for the team and a family member.
Marcy Phipps, Chief Flight Nurse at Global Jetcare, which specialises in long-haul repatriations, told ITIJ that it is detailed forward planning and logistical support that make such flights successful. “Long-haul air ambulance flights require advance planning for crew configurations and pilot changes,” she said. In addition, medical crews must conduct pre-trip visits to assess and evaluate patients and allow ample time for collaboration with the sending team. “That ensures all medical preparations, including transport from the hospital to the aircraft, are in place,” Phipps said. The team must also procure scheduled medications, food, additional oxygen stores and other elements vital for long distances.
Excessive stress and fatigue experienced by the crew has a direct impact on the patient. Fatigue, defined by the UN’s International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), is: ‘a physiological state of reduced mental or physical performance capability resulting from sleep loss or extended wakefulness, circadian phase, or workload (mental and/or physical activity) that can impair a crewmember’s alertness and ability to safely operate an aircraft or perform safety-related duties’. Fatigue can be dangerous – it can lead to slower reaction times, poorer co-ordination, difficulties sustaining attention, fixation and less creative problem-solving. Sleep is the only effective fatigue countermeasure because it allows the brain to recover, ICAO said.
Flight crew rest times are extremely well regulated – for example, by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the US and in Europe by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). The rules stipulate exactly how long breaks must be for pilots and other staff flying the plane depending on the number of time-zones they cross and in which direction.
However, no such rules exist for medical crews. It’s up to the air ambulance company to stipulate just how much doctors, nurses and other medical staff get to rest on a plane.
So, how does an air ambulance firm ensure both flight and medical crew have sufficient rest before flying a patient?
Solutions, not problems
Some use bigger planes, as the more powerful a plane is, the less frequently it will need to stop for refuelling. Dependent on completion, weight, balance, and extras such as wing tips and extra fuel tanks, generally speaking, most of the mid-size jets like the Hawker 800/100, Gulfstream 280/550, Falcon 2000 or Challenger 604 can cover 11 hours with a single stop. Smaller planes may require two or even three stopts for scheduled refuelling. Each stop takes time because it involves landing, taxiing to the refuelling depot and then a wait for take-off. So, whereas a commercial flight may take 11 hours, the same journey could extend to 15 hours by air ambulance.
Some firms will state rest times, but may expect their crews to spend quite a lot of that rest on the plane. Robert J. Starr, Director of Medical Services at Air Ambulance Worldwide, said that’s not ideal. “Being on the plane and resting is not getting rest, because you are still feeling the effects of altitude when you are flying even though the cabin is pressurised,” he explained. “On an aeroplane you have a lot of noise and vibration and a lot of stressors. You have environmental, physical and psychological stressors.”
it’s up to the air ambulance company to stipulate just how much doctors, nurses and other medical staff get to rest on a plane
A few companies even treat the medical crew in the same way as flight crew, said David Ewing, Executive Director, Global Market at Canada’s Skyservice Air Ambulance. “Government rules only apply to the flight crew and not the medical crew, though we try to follow the same rules for both groups, when possible,” he explained. “Also, the medical crew are encouraged when the patient is stable to have controlled rest within the cabin during long flights. That means taking turns closing their eyes and resting.”
Another option is to change the medical team completely on the way. Medic’Air International said it recently evacuated a patient from Abidjan, Côte d’Ivoire to Montreal, Canada with a fuel stop in Paris, France to change pilots and the medical team. This is a strategy that helps with ultra-long flights, such as those from Africa to North America, for example.
Take another ultra-long flight: a crew based in Florida is taking a patient from Perth, Australia to Florida, US, via Bangkok. The air ambulance company could use two teams. They might send the first ahead on a commercial flight a day before the second crew, which flies the air ambulance itself. The pre-positioned crew could rest in a Bangkok hotel and then pick up the plane when it arrives 24 hours later, taking it to Perth and then back to Bangkok, where they are able to hand over to the original crew who have had time to rest.
Alternatively, a wing-to-wing agreement could be struck with another carrier. Here the flight to Bangkok is met by another carrier which has brought the patient from Perth, so that the patient can fly in more or less one flight back to Florida.
Or both teams might be expected to travel on the same flight from Florida, and swap in Bangkok, and are expected to rest while on the plane.
However, not all ambulance firms will want to entail increased costs – such as pre-positioning pilots – because that involves commercial plane tickets, hotels and taxis, or employing a wing-to-wing carrier. They will also have to get governmental permits and visas for flight and medical crews.
How much is it worth?
Cost is inevitably a key consideration when planning a repatriation mission, and ensuring optimum crew rest can nudge costs up. “It is an increased cost for the insurer, so choosing wisely the company to undertake the mission in the first place is essential to a successful transport,” said Ewing. “Typically, shortcuts taken are those to save money for the client and don’t always work out. The saying ‘the cheap becomes expensive’ is often applied here.”
Christoph Ullrich, Senior Manager, International Network, for Germany’s travel club ADAC, which operates its own air ambulance service, agreed. “It really depends on the philosophy of the operator,” he said. “Although all the stakeholders in aeromedical transportation have to focus on costs, there are still some topics not to compromise on, like qualification of the medical teams, proper insurance and proper usage of your aircraft performance. A flight, for example, with a Learjet 35 with more than three technical stops with a patient on board would be a no-go for my company.”
Hotels must be well chosen too, said Ullrich. Some firms will automatically choose an airport-based hotel. So, while the aircrew can reach their beds quickly, the medical crew will have to travel to the treating hospital after a long flight. If the hospital is based
inside one of the world’s megacities, the distances covered will be large. Plus, there’s a high chance of travel problems, which will curtail the amount of rest the medical crew gets before the flight takes off again. “In huge cities like Bangkok, Mexico City or São Paulo, if you hit the rush-hour, the time from the hotel to pick up the patient can be three or five times as long compared with [the same journey] out of rush hour,” he said.
If weather isn’t factored in, that can lead to more problems too. “If you go to Ho Chi Minh City in the rainy season, for example, you can’t forecast the rainfall, but you have to take it into account because the traffic comes to a halt,” he explained. “And nobody cares if you have a patient onboard or whether you’re going to the airport.”
Journeys may be particularly gruelling. A patient may have a back or spinal injury, for example, so the journey to the airport by road may well take longer, in order to minimise discomfort.
A key strategy to ensure the wellbeing of a crew is to foster strong relationships between the members, said Global Jetcare’s Phipps. “Because we are rather a small company, our crew members fly together frequently and know one another very well. This results in our family-type camaraderie with all team members. They are sympathetic to the needs and idiosyncrasies of the others,” she said. During long trips with stays in foreign, and occasionally remote, locations, support among crew members is vital to the wellbeing of all. That helps emotional support when far away from home. “It directly impacts the care of the patient and the success of the trip,” Phipps said.
Trust amongst crew members and management is just as important, said Starr. The crew must be confident enough to declare when they are, for example, taking any medication or have consumed alcohol. “If it makes them drowsy, the medical director reviews that and make sure they are always fit to fly,” he said.
A key strategy to ensure the wellbeing of a crew is to foster strong relationships between the members
Take, as an example, a last-minute flight, in the early hours. The crew would be expected to declare exactly how much they may have drunk in the early evening. Some companies impose the so-called eight hours from bottle to throttle rule, to make sure they are fit to fly at the last minute.
Air ambulance firms also tend to outsource food provision. Some will provide nutritious meals, fresh fruit, plenty of water and snacks for their crews and others, the odd sandwich and chocolate bar. Some encourage their crews to eat smaller meals and often, because larger meals are likely to make them drowsy.
Choose wisely, or the costs could rise quickly
The philosophy of an air ambulance firm, therefore, is vital when choosing one for a long-haul flight. “The insurer/assistance company needs to choose the right company, for the right mission at the right time for an uneventful, successful transport of their clients,” said Skyservice Air Ambulance’s Ewing. “We provide our clients with options and are transparent about those options in order for them to make an educated decision for the transfer.”Stadnalone ITS: Check for already existing sessions

You don’t always need a special occasion to let your friends and family know how much you love them, and throw a great party that will be the talk of the town for months.
If you’re thinking about organizing a special event that will gather all the people you care about under the same roof, you should start by analyzing the best options in terms of venues, entertainment and transportation.
3 Reasons Why You Should Rent a Party Bus for Your Special Event
Depending on how many attendees you’re counting on, it may be a smart move to start comparing transportation solutions. If you’re putting on a great party for a larger group, here are 3 great reasons why renting a party bus would be an inspired decision.
- Comfort and Convenience. To begin with, take into consideration that fitting more than 5 people in one vehicle would be impossible. Unless you can count on some kind of shuttle service, you will force your guests to hail taxis in the middle of the night, or assign a few designated drivers. This situation can easily generate chaos and frustration, especially when people are supposed to reach their destination at the same time, or when finding a parking spot around the venue would be a real challenge. By renting a party bus that could comfortably accommodate all your guests you can make sure all your loved ones are chauffeured around town in style, and hit the party scene together.
- Excellent Entertainment Options. In all honesty, a taxi ride can get you out of the party mood really fast, especially when you get stuck in traffic for more than a few minutes and have to put up with the driver’s loud talking, awful singing or rude behavior.
Party bus hire services can help you prevent this worst-case scenario, while also offering you and your guests the chance to make the most of cool entertainment options that will improve your overall pre-party experience. Some of the best vehicles listed in this category come equipped with everything your heart desires, including a top-notch entertainment system, a chic bar station, and large flat screen TVs. Basically, such vehicles ensure a memorable “party on wheels” experience, and go beyond standard transportation options that do not add any real value to a special event.
- Safety Always Comes First. If you see your safety as a top priority, consider renting a party bus for a very simple reason: this chic, comfortable and convenient transportation option will help you avoid complications that may arise once the alcohol is flowing. Getting behind the wheel after a few drinks is never a good idea; at the same time, sticking to sodas when all your friends are enjoying the finest champagne can be quite frustrating. In this context, opt for the best solution to this potential problem: rent a party bus driven by an experienced chauffeur. This is a great method to make a grand entrance anywhere in the city, without putting your safety, and the safety of your guests on the line. At the end of the day, a professional driver could select the shortest, most amazing itineraries, and offer you valuable tips on how to take your party to the next level on your own terms.
Reserve Your Favorite Party Bus Today
At Moonlight Limo Rental & Car Service, you can choose from a great variety of modern, spacious, fully-equipped vehicles, including a stunning 37 passenger executive coach, a versatile 26 passenger party bus, and an 11 passenger sprinter van for smaller groups. Book your preferred vehicle today, and make use of an affordable transportation option that will be appreciated by your entire family of partygoers.Microsoft has started rolling out group video calling for Skype that will allow users of the mobile app to video chat with up to 24 other people at the same time. The company is extending the capability to iPhone, iPad and Android phones and tablets in Western Europe and North America from 19 February.
Group video calls have been available on the desktop version of Skype for some time but the mobile app has until now lacked the capability. Microsoft announced in January that it planned to push this to additional devices and said that "tens of thousands" had pre-registered to trial the new feature in January. The company has also upped the number of people who can be chatting at once from five to 25.
Users can chat in video HD video in either a grid mode that shows all the participants on-screen at once or a "focus view" that changes to display whoever is talking. Users are also able to "pin" certain participants to keep them in the foreground as well as invite users who don't have Skype to join the conversation by sending a web link, which can then be accessed via a desktop browser.
Microsoft said it expects to have completed the rollout by March 2016. It comes amidst a number of new features to hit the voice over IP service in recent months as it looks to fend off rival services, including real-time translation services and 3D Touch support for Apple's iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus.Come Join Our Team!

These are problems that Family Woodworking members noted that crop up sometimes, not standing issues with every single magazine power tool review. I hold magazine reviews in high regard – as a writer/tool researcher for ToolCrib.com. Here are some of the problems mentioned in the discussion:
1) Missing Model Syndrome
Where there’s a new or even old model missing – like if someone left the Bosch Colt out of a trim router comparison.
2) Improper Category Groupings/Comparisons
Say if a hybrid saw ended up in a cabinet saw comparison.
3) Bias in Testing to Favor Advertisers
This is alleged of course. One kind of bias cited is when the tests themselves are skewed to favor the new feature set of a new tool. That happens to be advertised heavily in the magazine…
4) Won’t Say It’s a Total Dud
Reviewers seem reluctant to proclaim a no-buy status for tools, when often times they should. Some think this is out of fear of losing advertising dollars.
5) Tester Overload – Too Many Tools, Too Many Comparison Points
Sometimes there’s just too much data for one person to sort through. You can see this especially when it comes to the writing.
>> Problems with Trusting Forum Recommendations:
There are some inherent problems with trusting forum recommendations too – the same pretty much goes for user reviews in Amazon or Epinions or the like.
1) “Purchase Justification” Bias
This was well put in the Family Woodworking thread by Bill Satko: “It is hard to spend that money on a tool and be honest about it. There is a lot of justification that we need to do to feel good about the purchase. We also tend to be brand loyal. Just look at the Lie Nielson vs Vertias handplane posts in SMC & Knots.”
2) Haven’t Used All Tools in Category
How many people IRL (in real life) have used all the tools in a particular category? Even the seasoned veteran woodworker hasn’t used ALL the band saws out there. Maybe half of them, but never all of them.
>> What Does the Perfect Review Look Like?
There’s no perfect review except for YOUR review, but here are some of the ideas from the thread.
1) Consumer Reports
No ads = no bias. Still, they sometimes leave out important models, and can they really justify extending into the power tool space?
2) Multiple Unbiased Forum Reviewers
While this would be pricey for manufacturers, this idea from Chuck Thoits would give other consumers a pretty good direction to go in: “So the only way to fix that is for all the tool companies to send one of each of there tools to every member here with a list of tests. We test them and send the info to a central location to be compiled into one test result. You know. We had one hundred WW test these tools and the XYZ came out on top with 79% voting it best in its class. And here is what they said. XYZ cut faster had less hand fatigue blaa blaa blaa Tell me if you read a tool test like that you wouldn’t know which one you where going to look for in the store. ”
3) Multiple Editorial Reviews
This concept comes from Art Mulder, a sometimes writer for Canadian Home Woodworker: “That is one of the things I like about reviews in Canadian Home Workshop magazine — they have three reviewers. Each of the three tries out ALL the tools, puts them through the same paces, and then writes up their thoughts. They never totally agree. And you get different things like “I have small hands and this tool fit my hands better”, and so on.”
4) Aggregate Magazine Reviews, Forum Reviews and User Feedback
For the comparison reviews I write for ToolCrib I find all the magazine reviews I can, all the blog and web reviews as well as all the forum recommendations I can and stir them together in a very unscientific way… While I think these comparisons serve as a great starting point for purchase decision making, they could benefit from some objective process and some sort of ranking format (which I am working on by the way). MetaCritic and ConsumerSearch are two of my inspirations for this direction.
Here are a few of recent examples:
Top 16 Trim Routers: Bosch Colt vs. Makita vs. PC310 vs. Ridgid R2400 and MORE!
Top 10 Hybrid Table Saws: Craftsman vs. Grizzly vs. Steel City vs. Jet and MORE!
Best 14? Bandsaws: Grizzly vs. Rikon vs. Powermatic vs. Laguna and More
So… how do you make your power tool purchase decisions?
Read more at Family Woodworking: Whats your view on Magazine Tool Reviews?
I am glad you brought this up.
My problem it their testing methods can be flawed.
I wrote about a test Popular Mechanics did on orbital sanders in October. You can clearly see in the test video that the sanders were using different types of sandpaper. The different types of sandpaper work better on certain materials over others. This is a huge flaw in the testing as far as I am concerned.
You can reed my full article here
Hey Chris – you make some great points in your warning about tool reviews, and offer some great advice. Especially the recommendation to read the BAD reviews… you can often learn more about a tool from the bad reviews than the good. People tend to be more specific I think.
Thanks for stopping by and adding to the conversation!
GPortland String Quartet
The outstanding Portland String Quartet performed at 2 p.m. Sunday, December 4, 2016 at Woodford's Church on Woodford Avenue in Portland, ME. Notable at this performance was the addition of guest soloist, Jesus Alfonzo, violist, who performed as fifth member of the ensemble, the richly beautiful String Quintet No. 2 in G Major by Johannes Brahms, after intermission. Alonzo, born in Caracas, Venezuela, is on the music faculty of Stetson University and is a member of the Bach Festival Orchestra in Winter Park, FL. He has written a book in which he credits the PSQ as being influential in the development of El Systema, the Venezuelan system of youth orchestras. That explains their longtime relationship. The delightful William Grant Still selection offered an opening number with a light musically open sound, clear as sparkling crystal, in the afternoon sun. I remember detecting the folk melody "Go, tell Aunt Rhody the old gray goose is dead." The third item was the only string quartet that Verdi ever wrote in which a theme heralds one from a future opera. Regretfully, my notes were lost with the program insert and this is all that I can venture without referring to them. That is, except to say that the PSQ lived up to its well- earned constantly high reputation for programming and performance. The experience was truly a gift of the season. May I refer you to Christopher Hyde's review at?Folks we don’t know what to tell you. If you’re going to be too lazy to read past a headline or two, you will be the pawn in the fake news game.

You are welcome America!This just in from @Zuercher, buyer of the 1982 Lancia Delta LX 1.5 that sold on BaT Auctions 10/25/17 (link) and featured in our Radwood Philly Event Coverage story here:
“I have been watching the Lancia Delta HFs, the Turbos, the Integrales, for years, long before they became the market darlings that they are today. That hard-line styling form the 80’s, it really impressed me.
So when this thing came up, it was a bit of an oddball. It was totally on a whim. I just placed a bid at the very end, and nobody else did, and I became the owner.
My experience with BaT was flawless. They have a system. I wanted to experience what it was like to import a car, and his was a pretty inexpensive way to see if it would be pleasant or not. I did have to wait, because this was October. It left in late January, and it landed on February 23, coming to the Elizabeth, New Jersey port.
I went to the auto terminal in Newark and arranged a flatbed truck to meet me there. There were all these cars out in this little portion of the parking lot, AMG Benzes and some Americana stuff. But my car wasn’t there! It was another part of the port, a mile and a half away.
I got in the car, and it started right up! The flatbed pulls up, we loaded the car in, and I follow him back. As of February 28th, I was now the owner of a garage-kept, untitled Lancia Delta in Gowanus, Brooklyn.
I had to wait for all the documents to be sent from Italy. They don’t include them in the car, in case the ship sinks…
Of course, the DMV didn’t know what any of this meant. Even though I had triplicates of everything, they sent me away. I went back and got my Italian friend and had her translate every piece of paper. After being turned away the second time, I hung around and tried to see who looked supervisory. There was an elderly woman who happened to be Italian descent, from Coney Island. I pleaded my case to her. She very kindly looked over the papers and said, if you get us a letter from the classic car dealer, stating that ownership did transfer from this person to this person, on their letterhead, I’ll get this title for you.
The dealer Fed-Exed it to me, and I titled the car in August of 2018. Six months after I received the car, and after three tries.
I called up Dominic’s European Car in White Plains, New York. They immediately fell in love with it. Santo and his brother Frank went through the car, and made a few adjustments to the engine and carburetor (in their words, ‘made it zippy’) and gave me a thumbs-up to drive it, and put my foot into it.
I proceeded to take the car to the Lime Rock Historic Races for its first outing, and drove it 70 mph from NYC to CT. Got it in the Italian Corral. I was able to clock two laps on the track and get the thing up to about 90 mph coming down the straight. They say the thing only does 100!
Following that, its second showing was down at Radwood in Philadelphia. I have to say, it was the most joyous car show I’ve ever attended. The concept, the people, the costumes, a little tongue in cheek, and the abundance of excellent cars representing the 80’s and 90’s. And the interaction was much more relaxed and positive than any car show I’ve been to. I’m looking forward to the next Radwood. Want to get more t-shirts.
At that point, I wanted to bring down more cars than I singlehandedly could. I didn’t have people who were free for the show, so I offered BaT the chance. I was very happy that Blake agreed to it. He drove it down there, and took some great photographs, and took care parking it in a garage, making sure it was protected, and brought it to the show. He even got it into Radwood Royalty, next to my other car. He brought it back to New York the following Monday, which went off without a hitch. I can’t thank him enough. Although, anyone’s nervous giving someone their car. But I felt: this is the car world, and we have to do our bit. These are machines that need to be driven.
For more than 25 years, I’ve specialized in high-end interiors in New York. In 2014, bought my first 900 Turbo and haven’t looked back. Having all this madness in my life, I’m thinking, maybe I should just follow my bliss. I founded Zurich Classic Motors, looking to specialize in the market that I love, which I believe is the Golden Age of the automobile and motorsports: the 80’s and the 90’s. I used to watch Bring a Trailer when they used to just compile listings from Craigslist and eBay. I was excited to actually bid once, and win once. I only bid once. I got what I wanted. All I can say is, it’s only brought me joy and some many new friends. It all circles back.”
Thanks to @netclassic for listing this neat little Giugiaro hatch with BaT Auctions, and to @Zuercher for sharing both your car and thoughts about it–we think it makes an amazing pair with your Saab 900 Turbo!

Mobile game development tools play a vital role in the development of any game. the PC and Console games market. By 2019 the global games market would be worth $118.6 billion, and mobile games would contribute as much as $52.5 billion out of it. This is good news for mobile game development companies.
With the rise in smartphone usage and mobile internet penetration, more and more people of all ages are playing mobile games, and more professional mobile game developers are creating games to meet their requirements. Some reasons why mobile gaming is gaining popularity are:
Portability:
Mobile phones are portable, and people can play the game anywhere, while waiting in a restaurant, on board a plane, in the classrooms, anywhere. All it takes for one is to download their favorite games from Apple’s AppStore or Google’s PlayStore and start playing the games.
Lower Development Costs:
Compared to Consoles or PC games, which most of the time cost in millions, the cost of developing mobile games are much less, and with so many mid-size game development studios present, you can get the games developed through them at a fraction of the cost and also faster.
Cheap and Free Games:
Most of the games which you can download from the app stores are free or affordable, typically in the range of $0.99 – $10. The free ones make money by offering some In-App purchases or using ads which can be annoying at times.
Game Controllers:
Earlier serious gamers as well as novice users used to prefer console gaming over mobile gaming because of game controllers to get that tactile feedback that a dedicated physical controller provided and which the touch-based controller on the mobile platform lacked. That has changed these days with many accessory manufacturers coming up with game controllers to be used with mobile devices like MOGA Pro Power, 60beat wired controller, PhoneJoy, iMpulse, Mad Catz C.T.R.L.R., SteelSeries Stratus XL, iDroid, etc. These can be connected to your mobile device using Bluetooth or via the 3.5mm jack on the phone.
Have a Game Idea. Now What?
So you have a brilliant idea for a game and want to get it developed, you can either create the game yourself or outsource the game development to a game development studio. Creating the game yourself is a time taking process since you have to learn programming languages or the functioning of game development engines and game character designing. Whereas, if you outsource the creation of games to a studio, you can get the games done fast, save lots of money as you don’t need to hire game designers or art designers or game programmers. With the studio’s expertise and experience of having created 100s of games, they would create a technologically advanced game with level designing, helping you in developing your gameplay and creating cross-platform compatible games which can be played on iPhone, iPad, Android-based mobile phones, Windows PC or Consoles.
With that said, let us take a look at some mobile game development tools which can be used to create mobile games by any novice game creators or experienced top game developers.
What is a Game Engine?
A game engine is nothing but software designed to create and develop video games. The game developers use the IOS and Android game engine to create games for PC, Consoles and Mobile devices and it helps the developers in doing common tasks like rendering graphics, collision detection, and response, physics, animation, AI, memory management, scene graph, etc. The mobile game engine also helps the developers to port the games to multiple platforms.
Some of the most famous games Dota 2, Battlefield 3, Crysis 2, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Badland, Cut the Rope were all developed using game engines.
Let us take a look at some of the game engines which are popular among developers creating mobile games.

Plunge into this lovely décor by hitting the ‘Spin’ Tab.
Key Features and Betting
The eye-catching symbols which grace the reels of Golden Egypt slot are Gems, Great Sphinx of Giza, Symbol of Life, Egyptian Jewelleries, God Set, Cleopatra and Caesar. To watch these symbols roll on the gold and purple reels, you must first place your stake. On the Total Bet Field, the bet options you have vary from £0.25 to £250.00. You can set your preferred stake by clicking on the increase or decrease arrows on that tab. However, you cannot change the number of active paylines on Golden Egypt slot, as these are fixed.
Other symbols you shall see are Wild and Bonus. There are two wild symbols, and these take the form of the WILD and Gold Coin. An Egyptian Landscape is the Bonus symbol. Also, the highest paying symbol is the Pharaoh which gives 300 coins for a combination of 5 such symbols.
While the base game is on, two complete reels can be randomly converted fully to wild for two consecutive spins, if 2 Gold Coins are seen on any of the reels. Plus, on every spin, you will see one random symbol being stacked, for higher winnings.
On Golden Egypt slot, you will also see the Free Spins Feature. When this is launched, you are given several options to select from. Below are the selections you have:

Cheney uses balanced offensive attack to rally past Colville 27-22, snapping 12-game losing skid
September 6, 2018
That didn’t take long.
Led by two touchdown passes from quarterback Alex Long and the stout defense of linebacker Jacob McGourin, the Cheney Blackhawks football team put an end to their 12-game losing streak with a 27-22 win over visiting Colville last Friday in their season opener at Tom Oswald Field.
Cheney head coach Bobby Byrd gave credit for the victory to good leadership skills on the part of his seniors, who kept calm after Blackhawk miscues, and some juniors and sophomores who absorbed the lessons delivered by the upper classmen.
Cheney turned the ball over four times, two fumbles...

These cookies have a deeper richness when baked with peanut butter that’s made with only peanuts (ideally roasted) and salt. Be sure to get the salted variety; unsalted can be bland at best and beany at worst.
Sometimes it’s labelled natural or old-fashioned, but there’s no industry standard, so checking the ingredient list is the only way to tell. Peanut butter spreads loaded with extra sweeteners, fats and stabilisers may give you more consistent results but lack the earthy nuttiness of the pure stuff.

Large 6 Inch Virtual Run Medal
Perched high in a tree, over a mountain cliff, a bird is never afraid of the branch breaking. The bird places trust in her own wings. In your life, during your runs, you will encounter some rotten trees and broken branches. Worried? Look inside yourself, find your strength, use your wings, do not rely on that branch to make your dreams come true. The “Look Inside You” medal is to remind yourself to not rely on others. Let go of that branch and find your inner strength to accomplish that goal.
In a story describing one of our other medals, I might have mentioned that Snow White was not a runner. I am proved wrong, once again. After participating in the Disney World Marathon and refreshing my memory of the Snow White movie once again, I believe I can safely say – that girl is a runner. In the movie, Snow White is doing a scary, night time trail run. She was trying to find her wings, but was having trouble with the foliage. Snow White broke a few branches, made some long falls, but came through her struggles well enough to be singing at the end of her run.
So I will continue to jog along singing a happy song, trying not to rely on the branch to support me looking for my inner runner, Snow White.
No matter who you are, look inside you, to make your wishes come true.

This looks like yet another one of your fantabulous medals with the excellent design and the wonderful artwork that your website here is now known for…..and with a great summertime theme to boot! So, let’s talk about the message behind this medal design…..I think it is very inspirational….I hope that people who do this event and receive their medals will remember their inner strengths when they see their medals hanging at home, and that they will remember their awesome accomplishments. Your reference to a bird perched in a tree, over a mountain cliff, never afraid of the branch breaking, that bird placing trust its own wings….and then with symbolism to our runs, our inner strengths, and accomplishing our goals…..that really is a very poetic and a wonderful artistic reference to think about. Another excellent job on this medal, per your usual! Bravo and Brava for the creative team here that inspires exercise, art, motivation and so much more!

You asked about my mileage goals…..well, I am definitely over 50 miles a month, but I am guessing I am probably under 75 miles a month, so doing pretty good, i think……and considering I was at 0 miles per month last August (LOL), and my very first 5K was last September. I am planning to work on a regular weight and exercise training type of program starting on Friday hopefully, as I have my 5K and 10K times and routines all nailed down by now. I am also doing cycling events from time to time……and honestly my energy level is way up compared to what it was a few short months ago……like a night and day type of difference.Surf Expo 2016

md5sum does *not* keep its entire target in memory. The md5 algorithm, as I understand it, uses the hash value of the previous block of data to compute the hash value of the next block. So only the previous hash value and the current block of data need to be in memory at a given time. So the above test is useless. It will *not* exercise all of your machine’s memory.
You can observe md5sum’s memory usage by looking at the output of ps or top.
‘Free’ command is not in Solaris. Nor does ‘Vmstat’ on Linux give equivalent info for ‘swap memory’ as ‘vmstat’ gives on Solaris. Do you know of any command common to both systems that would give me info on swap memory in fairly similar format?
Darren,
md5check actually uses shutil.copyfileobj to copy the file (which reads and writes 16KB chunks at a time), and then seeks back to the start of the source file, reads the whole thing into memory in one go, and computes its MD5. So it is not useless.
And you use it in single user mode.
cheers
There’s another way to test the memory using a shell script:
Alex M. – Tech Support – Unihost Brasil
wow…
“According to him if the checksums do not match, you have faulty memory guaranteed.”
If you drive has write issues (meaning it can’t write all of the same data each time), it will also cause the above behavior.
Saying such definite things is very misleading to those who don’t know any better.
Someone should also take a stab at the idea of “testing memory” while a kernel is loaded :/
It’s one reason things like memtest are supposed to be executed at boot, not after a kernel has loaded (since you can’t possibly test the RAM the kernel occupies).
memtest86 is not accurate either, we’ve had many occasions that multiple successful passes ran using memtest86 but still getting errors when actually using all the memory in Linux.
I would recommend running memtest86 as well as the md5sum method multiple times to be sure.
Have a question? Post it on our forum!Mauro Corda is a contemporary French sculptor. Born into a family tradition of Italian stonecutting, the scene was set for his own artistic preoccupation with three-dimensional form. Corda trained at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, and continues to live and work in Paris. His work has been exhibited internationally, and he has received honours including the scholarship of the Casa Velasquez, Madrid between 1985-7 and becoming a Knight of the French Order of Arts and Letters in 2010.
As an artist, Corda is engaged in the capturing of living forms, both human and animal, in a wide range of materials. His depiction of human figures has a classical basis but always with a contemporary angle, usually in their unusual and striking contortionist poses – bodies operating at the very extremes of flexibility and strength. There is also a contemporary angle to his varied and dramatic use of patinas. Corda is particularly interested in how different surface colours, textures and finishes can change the emotion of a piece, sometimes even rendering the same figure in opposing textures to demonstrate the difference finish can make to our viewing experience.
LOT 134 | [§] MAURO CORDA (FRENCH B.1960) | PETIT MEROU | Installation: 161cm x 150cm x 76cm (63.5in x 59in x 30in), Fish: 50cm x 99cm x 24cm (19.75in x 39in x 9.5in) | £6,000-8,000 + fees
In Petit Merou, Corda has turned his attention to a marine form. The merou (grouper) is sensitively rendered, but on a surprisingly large scale, and this sense of drama is extended in its presentation. A high-shine silver patina achieved by applying nickel plate to the bronze catches the eye, while the specific installation case allows the sculpture to be suspended within the space and surrounded by strings of silver beads, breaking up the surface of the sculpture and adding a sense of movement as though our merou is drifting through shoals of small fish and creatures deep underwater, elusive and always just out of reach. The result is a striking juxtaposition of seriousness and humour, very much in keeping with Corda’s oeuvre.Club Manager 2016 (Video Game), Full Version, PC Game, Download Free

What Causes Albinism.
There are different types of albinism
- Type 1 (no pigmentation caused by a deformity in genes which makes pigment),
- Type 2 (defect in a gene known as the P gene results in only some pigmentation),
- Hermansky - Pudlak Syndrome (caused by an individual gene which results in bleeding, lungs as well as bowel diseases)
- Ocular Albinism (affects the eyes, skin and hair).
At times, albinism is referred as Vitiligo but they are two different diseases. Albinism is an inheritable disorder and an individual suffers from albinism by birth whereas Vitiligo is an auto-immune disarray in the pigment which begins only after birth.
It is difficult to identify the exact causes of Albinism. However, here are some possible causes
Insufficient production of Melanin
When melanin, a natural pigment, is produced in insufficient amount or when the production is completely absent because of genetic mutation, you suffer from Albinism. Albinism is caused by the deformity in genes that produces melanin. Actually, genes are chemicals found in the body cells that aids in figuring a person's characteristics like skin or eye or hair color.
Heredity
Albinism is acquired from one or several defective genes from one of the parents or both. So, if you and your spouse have defective genes that is unable to supply the normal pigment amount known as melanin, then your child will certainly suffer from this disease. The risk of albinism is still there for children whose parents do not show up the disease but both have the defective genes that disturbs in melanin production.
Gene Mutation on X-Chromosome
Due to the gene mutant of X-chromosomes, albinism occurs only in men which is referred as X-linked ocular albinism. This is a type of albinism which includes vision problems. Their skin, eye and hair color is slightly light than other members in the family.
LYST gene mutation
Because of LYST gene mutation another type of albinism is caused which is referred as Chediak-Higashi Syndrome. When you suffer from this type of albinism, the hair turns brown or blonde and skin becomes silvery off white or grayish. Also, the victim of Chediak-Higashi syndrome have a deformity in white blood cells which certainly expands the risk of infections.The pedal assist

My colleague intends to perform GWAS (genome-wide association study) on a group of oil palms for the purpose of finding genetic markers associated with variation in some economically important traits, mainly oil yield. The results can then be used for genomic selection.
Here is the current tentative plan:
Out of 192 palms (all progeny of just two parents, one from the Piscifera variety, and the other from Dura.),
two extreme populations (24 with the high oil yields and 24 with the lowest) will go through Genotyping by Sequencing to obtain genotypic data for about a few thousand SNPs for these individuals.
The 48 genotyped palms will then be used as the training population for the GWAS analysis.
My colleague is worried that there may not be enough genetic variation in the study population for the GWAS to be meaningful. The reason my colleague does not intend to use all 192 palms is that genotyping all of them will be very costly. However, if it turns out that he needs to use all 192 palms for the GWAS to work, he will do so.
Should he go through with it? What are the problems or errors that he may encounter?
Any info on how to determine the required size for a GWAS training population will also be highly appreciated.
Thank you very much in advance !Other opportunities

Experienced Alternative Dispute Resolution Attorneys in Illinois
A trial is not the only means by which to settle a legal dispute. Sometimes, due to the value of the case, the parties involved or other factors, a courtroom is not the best place to resolve a legal conflict. Other times, contracts or court rules or orders require the parties to attempt alternative dispute resolution (ADR) prior to trying their case in a court of law.
Alternative dispute resolution, including formal arbitration (binding and non-binding), third-party mediation and counsel-mediated negotiation can be highly effective. Momkus LLC’s litigation attorneys have arbitrated many cases and some serve on arbitration panels.
Our litigation team includes senior attorney James S. Harkness, who contributed to the Arbitration Manual for DuPage arbitrators and acted as the Chairmen of the Alternative Dispute Resolution Committee. In your dispute, you can have the confidence that our team helped “write the book.”
Arbitration and Mediation in Business Disputes
Arbitration or mediation can be particularly helpful for resolving complex commercial disputes wherein it is important to preserve relationships and avoid a costly litigation process. At Momkus LLC, we are a business-oriented firm with in-depth knowledge of all aspects related to commercial legal matters. Our business law and commercial litigation groups work closely with our clients to develop the most practical solution to resolve their dispute based on their needs and goals. In many cases, alternative dispute resolution is highly preferable to trying the matter in court.
We represent clients in arbitration and mediation proceedings for a wide range of business disputes, including:
- Banking and Financial
- Contract Disputes
- Commercial Landlord-Tenant Disputes
- Construction Disputes

There are some significant differences between arbitration and mediation. Arbitration is a more adversarial process involving a neutral arbitrator (or panel of arbitrators) selected by both parties to hear evidence and (in most instances) decide the case. The proceeding is generally more relaxed than litigation. Parties choose either binding or non-binding arbitration. In binding arbitration, the decision rendered by the arbitrator is final. In non-binding arbitration, it is usually just an advisory opinion.
Mediation is a process by which the parties agree to resolve their differences without litigation or arbitration and with the help of a neutral mediator. Unlike arbitration, the mediator has no power to rule on the dispute; he/she is there to encourage open communication and help the parties work out an amicable settlement. In mediation, the law and the facts of the case are important, but they are not the determining factors in resolving the dispute. At the end of the day, both parties must be in agreement for the settlement to be binding.

Habitat for Humanity Sri Lanka celebrated the joy of Christmas by hosting its first Christmas fundraising event titled “Christmas with a Cause” on 15th and 16th December 2018 at the St. Paul the Apostle Church located on Kynsey road. Christmas with a Cause was a two-day weekend event that catered to the whole family; and was made lively by the participation of over 40 vendors who sold items that ranged from food to jewellery, shoes and clothing. Under the profit-sharing model many vendors also opted to donate a portion of their proceeds towards supporting Habitat’s vision and mission in Sri Lanka. While raising funds to support Habitat’s work across Sri Lanka, this event also provided the team an opportunity to raise awareness about its work in the country throughout the past 25 years.
The event was sponsored by the generosity of Main Sponsors such as Janashakthi Insurance PLC, Hatton National Bank PLC, Stafford International School, Heritage Teas. The event was also supported by brands such as Elephant House, Coca-Cola Beverages and Rosewall Interiors. The unique event provided an opportunity for Habitat for Humanity Sri Lanka to partner with Embark by hosting multiple puppy-petting sessions which were much loved by the children who attended the event.
On the 16th of December, Habitat Sri Lanka also hosted it’s very first ‘Habitat Holiday Open-Mic Night’ at The Cauldron, Colombo 05, which was a sub-event of the ‘Christmas with a Cause’ initiative. This event provided a platform for many talented young artists to take the stage and perform songs of varying genres which talked about love, faith and hope. The objective of this event was to create awareness about Habitat for Humanity Sri Lanka’s work in the country among the local youth who would like to join hands with Habitat in its future activities.
A home acts as a foundation to the life of a family in need, and equips each family member with strength, stability and self-reliance. Everyone who attended and supported “Christmas with a Cause” both directly and in-directly contributed towards uplifting the lives of families in need of decent shelter across Sri Lanka.

WebsiteThis month the DCMS released their annual Taking Part survey. The report covers the 12 month period from April 2010 to March 2011 and includes participation in culture and sport, volunteering, digital participation, and cycling and swimming proficiency. Included in this is usage of public libraries by both adults and children. As you would expect, it highlights some interesting data about the state of library usage in this country which should certainly be of interest to library campaigners across the country.
One of the most interesting statistics to come out of this report reflects the usage of libraries by people in both the most and least deprived areas. Whilst The Bookseller chose to headline their coverage of the findings ‘Better off more likely to use libraries’, the reality is much less clear-cut. The report found that 43.5% of people from the least deprived parts of England used a library last year, compared to 39.5% of those from the most deprived. Whilst there is clearly a difference, 4% is not sufficient to conclusively argue that the ‘better off’ are more likely to use a library than the most disadvantaged. In fact, what is most stark about these figures is that social background appears to have no bearing on library usage. This rather contradicts the belief expressed by some that ‘libraries cater for the middle classes, not the deprived’. The figures very much demonstrate that they cater for both.
The report also demonstrated the importance of public libraries for children, not least considering the increasing cull of school libraries. It revealed that 76.4% of 5-10 year olds had visited their local library in the past year, up from 72.2% in 2008/9. The impact library closures would have on literacy levels is clear and unambiguous. With an increasing demand from the 5-10 age group and the closure of school libraries across the country, the public library has never been more important for the social and economic wellbeing of future generations.
The report also reveals that against a backdrop of supposed decline in library usage, adult library usage has in fact remained static. For each of the past three years the percentage of adults using the library has remained at approximately the same level. In fact, the proportion of adults using the public library has increased by 0.3% on last year to 39.7%. The fact that this figure has remained constant for three years, in spite of already significant cuts to library services, also rather suggests that those arguing that libraries are ‘irrelevant’ are out of touch with both what libraries are offering and the needs of library users across the country. If authorities are threatening to close up to 50% of libraries when usage has remained stable, will similar cuts be applied to other council services?
Overall, the Taking Part survey clearly demonstrates that reports of the rapid decline of public libraries has been greatly exaggerated. They are not an institution solely catering for the middle-classes as some politicians and commentators have argued. They are as much used by people in the most deprived areas as those from the least, and draw users from across the whole of our society – the quintessential universal service. Children are drawn to the library in increasing numbers, alone, with school groups and friends, and with parents, who rely on them to support their child’s literacy and development. Despite the growth of the internet and the availability of popular ‘books in supermarkets’, people still make significant use of their free access to a wide range of books and other resources. Despite suggestions to the contrary, adult library usage is not in terminal decline. If usage has remained stable while budgets have been slashed, imagine what could be achieved if we invested in our public libraries. Councillors and politicians may be keen to argue that libraries are becoming irrelevant, in order to justify closing them or staffing them with volunteers. The facts suggests otherwise.

The clouds could not be more misleading. It would appear, if you did not know we were facing a record drought, that it could rain at any moment. But like many other days this summer, rain never fell and his soybean and corn fields would not receive the relief they so desperately needed.
Don Swanson peers to the horizon as grey skies fill the area. Drought conditions have taken hold across much of Iowa.
“We got off to a great start this spring,” Swanson said. “We started planting corn in early April, and we got the soybeans in without any problems. At this point, the soybeans are showing good color, but there are a lot of abortion in pods, and I think they’ve gone backwards in height as they’ve tried to conserve all the moisture they can.”
Swanson reached down and pulled one of his soybean plants from the field and instinctively examined it while shaking his head. While looking at the plants health, he voiced his concern that the drought conditions will soon be bringing other problems.
“I’m very nervous about spider mites and aphids coming in,” Swanson said while looking at the leaves of the soybean plant. ”We’re still optimistic and as weather conditions warrant we’ll still fight the bugs.”
But the outlook for rain to come to the rescue is looking as dark like as the skies above. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is predicting the drought to persist or intensify through October, 31.
“There’s nothing in the forecast,” Swanson said about the chance for rain. “The question now will be analyzing our crop insurance guarantees to look at economic thresholds. We’ll have to see if there’s a chance to continue to invest in this crop to provide an economic return above the federal threshold.”
Swanson like many other farmers will continue to watch the situation and work his hardest to grow a successful crop. “Farmers aren’t good at giving up,” Swanson said.
Originally published for the Iowa Soybean Association.In an October 28, 2018 article, Muwaffaq Matar, a member of Fatah's Revolutionary Council and a regular columnist for the Palestinian Authority (PA) daily Al-Hayat Al-Jadida, attacked Arab countries for normalizing their relations with Israel, especially the UAE and Qatar, which are hosting Israeli athletes as part of the 2018 Grand Slam in Abu Dhabi and the 2018 Artistic Gymnastics Championship in Doha. He called this a violation of the principles of the Arab League and of the resolutions of the 2002 Arab peace initiative, which state that normalization between Israel and the Arabs will happen only after an agreed-upon solution is found for the Palestinian problem. He condemned the playing of the Israeli anthem at the tournaments, and presented its words, claiming that it includes lines such as "we shall thrust our spears into the chests of our enemies and see their spilt blood and severed heads."
The following are excerpts from his article:[1]
Muwaffaq Matar (image: alwatanvoice.com)
"Who could have imagined such a situation? The Palestinian leadership achieves breakthroughs on the front against the Israeli occupation state, [a front] that stretches from Europe to every corner of the world, and attains political and diplomatic achievements for the Palestinian people and their just cause, which is the chief cause of the Arab nation. [Yet] at the same time, the Israeli occupation state achieves significant breakthroughs in terms of normalization [with countries] within our own strategic Arab depth, and attains achievements that serve the claim of the racist Binyamin Netanyahu, head of the extremist and terrorist [Israeli ] coalition government, that 'Israel and the Arabs form a single front against Iran'!
"We understand perfectly well that [various] Arab countries and their governments have their own interests, which nobody should interfere in, but we [nevertheless wish to] remind our Arab brothers of the Arab [peace] initiative, which they signed at the 14th [Arab League] summit in Beirut in 2002, which stated as follows:
"'As part of adopting the Saudi initiative by the [Arab] summit council as an Arab peace initiative, the council requests that Israel reconsider its policies and incline towards peace, and declare that a just peace is its strategic option as well.
"'The council further demands the following from [Israel]:
"'A. Full withdrawal from all the Arab occupied territories, including the Syrian Golan Heights, to the June 4, 1967 lines as well as the remaining occupied June 4, 1967 in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as its capital.
"'Subsequently, the Arab countries will do the following:
"'A. Consider the Arab-Israeli conflict ended, and enter into a peace agreement with Israel, and provide security for all the states of the region.
"'B. Establish normal relations with Israel in the context of this comprehensive peace.'
"'Guarantees the rejection of all forms of Palestinian patriation which conflict with the special circumstances of the Arab host countries.'
"We know very well that [Arab states] have officially maintained contacts [with Israel], some covert and some overt, without shame, in flagrant violation of the resolutions of the 2002 Beirut summit. But what is saddening, and it would not be an exaggeration to call it a disaster, is that we [now] see Israeli sports delegations [competing] before spectators in stadiums in Arab countries, while raising the flag of the occupation state. The most painful thing of all is that these spectators stand for the anthem of the State of Israel, which is occupying [Jerusalem], the first [Muslim] direction of prayer and [the location of] the third most important mosque [Al-Aqsa]...
"Our brothers, the spectators at the stadiums where the world championships in judo and gymnastics [are taking place], here are the words of the racist, colonialist, occupying and terrorist anthem that you listen to while gazing at the wide smile of [Israel's] Culture and Youth Minister [sic], the extremist Miri Regev, who is working to destroy the culture of the youth in Palestine… You may also hear some [Israelis], among them soldiers who have killed Palestinian children and youths, repeat these [words] in your ears, and you may wish to turn deaf before these words reach your ears.
"You will hear from them [the Israelis] the following words: 'As long as in the heart within, the Jewish soul yearns...[2] aspiring onwards, toward the east, our hope has not materialized,[3] the hope that is a thousand years old on our land... the land of Zion and Jerusalem.].'
"Be informed, our [Arab] brothers, that the Jewish ISIS has reached your lands, this time with its blue flag, as you enjoy [the anthem which describes] spears being thrust into the chests of the sons of Canaan and their severed heads.
"All of us – the Palestinian unions, popular organizations and professional syndicates, as well as their Arab counterparts – are responsible for the large fissures that have opened up in the wall of our strategic Arab depth. What is happening is totally illogical: the [Arab] brothers welcome the colonialist occupiers on the pretext of their participation in world championships, while the world champions in [the domain of] conscience, morality, and the values of freedom and human rights deliver resounding blows [to the Zionists]. Oh Arabs, we must take an example from the BDS movement. Take heed and do not be captivated by the somersaults of Netanyahu and Miri Regev at the gymnastics and judo [championships]. They will end up winning the gold, while you end up at the finals with tin."Thank You!

With support from foremost beer brand, Tiger Beer the first edition of the Born In Africa Festival (BAFEST) will feature some of the best acts from the African entertainment scene.
Borne out of a growing desire to provide a platform where the best entertainers on the continent can showcase their talents, as well as celebrate the dynamism of Africa, the Born in Africa Festival is an initiative by Livespot, and early indications suggest this may be the African concert of the year.
Other performing acts include Flavour, Wande Coal,Yemi Alade, and Timaya, as well as East African singing sensation Awilo Longomba and South African rapper Sho Madjozi.
Tiger Beer which was launched in Nigeria back in April has already made giant strides in the Nigerian beer market. Its unveiling was part of a captivating initiative which saw Nigerian celebrities face and conquer their fears as the brand sought to communicate its “Uncage” brand messaging.
Tiger beer now seeks to get even closer to its consumers with the sponsorship of the BAFEST. Speaking ahead of the event, Brand Manager, International brands, Nigerian Breweries Plc, Chinwe Greg-Egu said, “Tiger beer celebrates the passion and daring nature of young Nigerians. Tiger highlights their courage as they dare to be different and dare to stand out, which is why BAFest was a no brainer for us”.
Reiterating on Tiger’s support of the festival, Marketing Director, Nigerian Breweries Plc, Emmuanuel Oriakhi added that, “We believe that BAFEST gives us the opportunity to engage with our core consumers as they come together to celebrate the best things about being African. We are excited at the opportunity to be part of this event and we look forward to immersing the brand in the African and Nigerian culture through the Born In Africa Festival. We’re excited to share our plans for the brand, as Tiger will be doing quite a lot from now into 2019 to ensure Tiger Beer is etched into the minds of its consumers”.
The world-acclaimed lager will also be hosting a party on the 22nd of December, where the beer brand will bring together the most daring, courageous Nigerians to celebrate what has been a landmark year for the relatively new beer brand in Nigeria..

Inconsistency is proving quite an issue for the Red Devils this season, having won their opening three Premier League games but since securing five out of a possible 15 points.
Pinpointing the exact problem is proving a difficult task for Mourinho. United have scored and conceded a respectable 13 and eight league goals respectively yet results haven't been going their way.

In the eyes of some, though, it's poor performances from the likes of Paul Pogba, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Wayne Rooney that's having a negative effect.
Pogba has been under pressure from the get-go and failed to deliver since completing an £89 million move, while Ibrahimovic has missed the most 'big chances' in the Premier League so far and Rooney continues to disappoint.
And it would seem Mourinho is coming around to the idea that his star players are letting the team down, so much so that he's sent a strong warning to his men that no one is "untouchable" under his reign.
The Portuguese once hailed his title-winning Chelsea side of 2005 as untouchable but insists that isn't the case at United.
He said, per the Independent: "That was 11 years ago,."
If that's not motivation for United's players to step up their game, I don't know what is.
Mourinho did save praise for Ibrahimovic, though, hailing the 35-year-old for the impact he's made in United's dressing room since joining for free over the summer.
"I'm really happy. He's giving us exactly what we need from him," he added.

A huge presence Ibrahimovic might be in the dressing room, but Mourinho will hope his star striker quickly rediscovers his goalscoring touch having scored just once in his last seven games, coming against Zorya in the Europa League.Betty Kadekawa, 85, died May 24, 2013; She was born December 2, 1927; Inurnment service - Friday, September 6, 2013, 10:30 am at Valley of the Temples

As the fall air transforms into an awakening winter breeze, luxury travelers start thinking of many winter past times.
Skiing, snowshoeing, hot cocoa in the lodge — certainly a massage is also in order.
And of course, you must look good doing it all.
A luxury ski vacation requires so much more than a pair of skis and a fancy SUV to take you up the mountain.
Here at Estates & Wedding Events we want to provide you with the Ultimate Guide to Luxury Ski Vacations.
Here’s a quick breakdown on how this guide will work:
• The Top 7 Ski Destinations
• Must-Have Ski Accessories for 2013
• Tipping 101: What’s Appropriate on the Mountain?
• Testimonials & Stories
Let’s get started...
The Top 7 Ski Destinations
You have plenty of amazing global options when it comes to choosing the locale of your next ski getaway.
Here are our 10 favorites to help make the decision-making process a bit easier.
1) Vail & Beaver Creek — Colorado
When you think of skiing, Colorado has to be at the top of your list (and trust me, this won’t be the only Colorado destination mentioned here!).
Located two hours west of Denver in the Rocky Mountains, Vail and Beaver Creek offer classic elegance with modern amenities.
Both locations (they’re located about 15 minutes apart, but both offer shuttles that go back and forth throughout the day) have impressive ski lifts that are easy to reach from wherever you’re staying inside the respective village.
Vail, which recently celebrated its 50th birthday, has the stunning Arrabelle luxury resort, which literally surrounds Vail Village.
If you decide to stay in Beaver Creek, you can’t go wrong with the Ritz Carlton.
2) Lake Tahoe — California
Site of the 1960 Winter Olympic Games, Northstar and Squaw Valley in beautiful Lake Tahoe is a skier and snowboarder’s paradise.
And if you’re looking for an amazing workout, try snowshoeing the many trails that weave in and out of the resorts.
When it comes to destinations, again, you can’t go wrong with the Ritz Carlton, but you might be intrigued to try out the Tahoe Mountain Club.
This rustic lodge offers plenty of options for children and a spa that is to die-for.
3) Telluride — Colorado
Driving into Telluride is like teleporting into an old Western town.
Located in the San Juan Mountains, Telluride is rich with old Western history — especially when it comes to the mining industry.
The small-town feel offers plenty of luxurious amenities and some of the world’s best skiing.
And if you’re a cross-country skier, you’re in luck.
Telluride’s backcountry is a never-ending landscape of adventure.
Make sure to book a room at the Lumiére Telluride, the luxury hotel of this Colorado town.
This boutique hotel only has 11 rooms and 18 one- to four-bedroom residences — perfect for a family gathering.
4) Whistler — British Columbia, Canada
Here’s another location where serious skiers and snowboarders can explore for a weeklong vacation.
The slopes appear to go on forever in Whistler, but the real adventure-seeker will want to mark off heli-skiing off their bucket list, as several companies in the area offer the heart-pounding adventure.
Where should you stay?
Look no further than the Fairmont Chateau Whistler.
This resort offers ski-in/ski-out, the world’s greatest room service and if you’re in the mood to get married, there’s a lovely wedding chapel, too.
5) Stowe — Vermont
The valley between Mount Mansfield and the Green Mountains is where you’ll find this gem of a destination.
Skiing on Stowe Mountain is a must, but no trip to Vermont is complete without a carriage ride through downtown and then onto some of the scenic trails.
Reserve a room at the Stowe Mountain Lodge and grab dinner at the Blue Moon Café — a local favorite that just celebrated 20 years of being in business.
6) Deer Valley, Utah
Located north of its rival Rocky Mountains is Flagstaff Mountain — the home of Deer Valley Resort — in Utah.
Forget skiing for just a moment and check out the Montage Deer Valley.
The Montage offers world-class amenities, including one of the best spas in the west, according to Condé Nast Traveler.
From the Montage’s website, the comfortable and relaxing, 600-square-foot rooms “offer rich estate-quality furnishings, commissioned artwork, comfortable sitting areas and gas fireplaces.”
7) Jackson Hole, Wyoming
You may not think that seasoned travelers have Wyoming on their “must-visit” lists, but Jackson Hole is a diamond in the rough.
As previously mentioned here at Estates & Wedding Events, Jackson Hole is a beautiful spring and summer getaway, but come winter, it’s simply amazing.
Ski in the morning, shop in the afternoon, eat at exquisite restaurants, schedule a massage for the next morning and repeat.
Before you ski down the mountain, take in the view from the gondola that appears to be making its way up the heavens.
On your way down, hang on.
Many of the slopes here are suitable for beginners.
Must-Have Ski Accessories for 2013
Did Santa bring you everything you asked for this Christmas?
If not, don’t worry; there are plenty of must-have ski accessories for the New Year.
We’ll break this list down from the “stocking-stuffer” category to the “true luxury traveler” category.
Stocking-Stuffer Ski Accessories
This category features accessories $20 or less.
Buff Headwear
A great ski accessory is a practical accessory.
Buff Headwear certainly qualifies under this notion.
At first glance, this $20 bandana looks just like that: A big bandana.
Upon further review, its functionality is astounding.
Wrap around your head anyway you desire.
It makes a great headband, full-face cover, scarf, pirate costume — you name it!
But after a run or two down the slopes, you’ll appreciate what it can really be used for:
A goggle wipe!
Wipe away the snow and slush and get ready for another trip down the mountain.
Powder Baskets
You’re bound to hit the slopes one day this ski season after a heavy snow.
The result?
Lots of powder that you can easily lose your poles in if you’re not careful.
That’s where Powder Baskets come into play.
These plastic, $7 ski pole accessories, simply slide onto your pole and hold in place, creating an extra barrier to prevent your poles from going too deep into the powder.
They’re little and cheap, but they are effective.
Make sure you bring a pole with you the next time you’re out looking for some powder baskets.
They won’t fit all poles, so you’ll need to do some work.
Luxury Travel Ski Accessories
This category features accessories a bit more on the pricier side.
Abs Vario Base Unit
A skier’s worst nightmare is an avalanche.
The Abs Vario Base Unit takes you out of that nightmare in a hurry.
The German-engineered and designed technology features twin air bags that inflate with a volume of 170 liters almost instantly when trouble is near.
All you do is a give a quick tug and you’ll be huge.
For almost $1,000, this might seem expensive, but if you’re a thrill-seeking skier, you never want to take any chances.
You get twin airbags for life from the company and an extensive emergency kit.
GoPro HD Hero2
Go Pro is the go-to (no pun intended) gadget for skiers who want to preserve their adventures in high definition.
What makes this $300 video camera so special is its ability to latch on to practically anything.
A popular choice is the helmet, giving your video the best possible first-person-point-of-view experience.
LifeProof iPhone Armband
Back in the day, skiers didn’t have to worry about bringing anything but their skis, poles and some warm winter gear with them up the mountain.
Today, you have your camera (and video camera) and smartphone.
And as pointed out on this blog, the iPhone tends to be the smartphone of choice for many people.
The LifeProof iPhone armband ($50) secures your iPhone and keeps it positioned when doing pretty much anything — including ski jumps — on the mountain.
The best part is that all of the buttons are accessible and easy to reach.
You can mount your iPhone face-in or face-out, with no worries about the display becoming scratched.
Throw on a pair of Bluetooth headphones and you’ll be set for the day.
Tipping 101: What’s Appropriate on the Mountain?
Going out to eat is easy: 20 percent for good service and 15 percent for so-so service.
Many restaurants even write out the tip for you.
But what about our Ski Butlers?
What about the people that are taking your bags and skis when you walk into the resort?
Throw in all of these people and the little service perks you receive along the way, and tipping becomes a bit more complicated.
Here are some general rules of thumb when it comes to tipping on your next luxury ski vacation:
1) Carry plenty of $1 and $5 bills.
You don’t want to get caught with a wallet filled with $20s and $50s when a bellhop moves your bag from the lobby to your car.
That’s way too much.
2) Be aware of consistent service.
There will be some concierge people at the resort whom you’ll have daily interactions with.
A valet man, maybe a waitress.
Tip these people a couple of dollars each day — no more than $3.
At the end of your trip, if they’ve treated you well, give them $20-$30 to show your appreciation.
3) 20% for spa treatments.
Spa treatments are tricky — you’re already paying a lot of money for services, but 20 percent is standard for what is expected, in terms of tipping.
4) Doormen: Be cautious.
A doorman in the mountains isn’t like a doorman in New York City.
The doorman at the luxury ski resort is the arranger typically, not the doer.
He will call the valet driver, make your reservations, or have a rental car arranged.
This service is commendable, but no more than $5.
5) Bellman earn per bag.
If you’re on a luxury ski getaway, a bellman can earn some great tips, but he has a lot of work.
Typically, you’ll have three to five bags per person for a weeklong ski vacation.
This means 12 to 20 bags with a family of four.
If the bellman is bringing all those bags from the lobby to your room, you should give him $2 per bag, which means upwards to $40.
Simply shake his hand and hand him the tip once he’s done.
6) When do I tip the concierge?
The concierge in a ski resort can be a huge help.
From making reservations to finding some great entertainment for the night, your trip can be significantly better thanks to him or her.
But for the most part, you only talk to this person on the phone, and rarely in person.
If your concierge has done a suitable job for you throughout the week of your ski vacation, write a small note, and put it in an envelope with $30 to $50, depending on the level of service.
8) Front desk staff should rarely receive a tip
Because they’re paid more than the service-friendly occupations.
However, if they go out of their way, make a smart decision and reward appropriately.

When asked for feedback in general, one of the lovely users of our bags sent us a full review and we couldn't help but share it with you!
So here we go, a review on Rei from Sandy, a hobbyist photographer and public servant based in Australia. (But before that, we asked her to share some photos for us to have a glimpse of her world through her beautiful lenses...)
Some of Sandy's favorite photographs:
Her candid take on Rei:
When I first saw the ADC launch collection, I was impressed! It was no longer a choice between carrying my dSLR into an ugly and functional bag or simply chucking it into one of my handbags *gasps* (yes, I’m a terrible owner). So, I made up my mind to get one of the bags to make it up to my long-suffering camera.
I eventually picked the Rei and here's my review of the bag:
Why Rei:
Being a casual photographer, I don’t have much equipment to carry. Usually it’d just be my Canon 450D + 18-55mm f2.8 lens so I ruled out the larger options like Valencia. I also wanted something a bit more glam for the stylish and put-together look since my wardrobe was sorely lacking in such options. Rei was a natural choice for me with its classy lock clasp and short handle option.
Three things I love about it:
What I’m not so crazy about:
I’m a bit hard-pressed to think of something but if there was just one thing… Probably because it was made to fit snugly, it is a bit of a struggle to remove/ put in the camera box for times where I want to carry the bag without the camera (and I’ve done that a lot!) However, I’ve found my own quick-fix around that by keeping the box in the bag, just without the partitions. It doesn't add much weight and also reinforces the structured shape.
Overall verdict:
I love how it looks structured but is light at the same time because the nylon material. The latter is a big draw for me given that I don’t really want to be carrying around any extra weight other than equipment if I'm out and about for an entire day. I’ve gotten compliments from people for it from the first day I brought it out which kind of surprised me because it is a really understated black bag. Am super pleased with the purchase!
Thank you so much for your review Sandy! For all the other lovely ladies out there, we welcome your feedback or suggestions that will help us to create great bags for you. :)>>)

And far from being a Winter's Respite, here in Australia it is the middle of summer, and the temperature had been around 34 deg C - 37 deg C (93.2 deg F to 98.6 deg F for my American friends) and extremely humid, so concentration levels have been at an all time low for me. For this read-a-thon I managed to read:
- 3 Chapters of 'A Hambledown Drean', by Dean Mayes.
- 3/4 of 'Heir to the Shadows', by Anne Bishop
On the plus side, this week is looking to be a little less hectic. As always, I enjoyed participating in the read-a-thon, even though I couldn't contribute as much as I would have liked.
Thank you for joining me, Ashleigh. Hey, you got some reading done anyway. I think we really did about the same. Hosting takes away a bit from my reading. Not that I mind. =O) I hope you enjoyed it. I have the wrap-up posted, if you want to add your link.

Salutations™!!
Finally, after a break of several weeks, I have a haul to write about. Yay, me! It was good to get back in Underdog Records, see Jonathan, bin dive and then actually getting some good record listening time in. Here’s what we got:
©Columbia
- New Order – Movement — The debut album from New Order after the death of Ian Curtis and thus ending Joy Division. The BCPF says “this is my jam.” Needless to say, she likes it. I didn’t mind it. It was decent. New.
- Nirvana – Nevermind — In September when the anniversary of this album came around, I went to play it in honor of the milestone. I looked and looked and looked. I couldn’t find it. I looked on Discogs and it wasn’t there, either. I keep a list of the RS list to see what I have collected from it. It wasn’t marked there, either. I was flabbergasted. How did I not have it? Well, I didn’t and now, I can’t say that anymore. I got it yesterday. I hated it when it came out. I hated the idea of grunge taking over the hair band scene. I’ve talked about that ad nauseum, so I’ll leave it be. This was new.
- Pixies – Surfer Rosa — I actually got this last week when I couldn’t stay away from Underdog. It’s one of The BCPF’s faves and we know I want her to get what she wants, even when she didn’t know it was there to want. The record that is, she knew about the album. VG++.
- Stan Getz – Captain Marvel — This album is great! Not only do you get the lyrical sexy saxy stylings of Stan Getz but you get Chick Corea on electric piano, Stanley Clarke on bass, Airto Moreira on percussion and drum hall of fame member (and drummer for Miles Davis) Tony Williams. Such great stuff. VG+.
- Wings – Wings Over America — a 3xLP live album from Sir Paul (before he was Sir) and company. It is heavy, for sure. It feels like it weighs about 10 pounds, but really it is only about one. Haven’t listened yet. VG+.
- George Harrison – Dark Horse — Not my favorite George album, but it has some great spots. The BCPF was excited to get it. VG+.
- Randy Newman – Trouble In Paradise — I love Randy Newman and when I see something from him that I don’t already have, I need to get it. This has the hit “I Love LA” and a tune called “The Blues” which is a duet with Paul Simon. VG+.
- Yes – Going For The One — The eighth studio album from Yes, which marked the return of Rick Wakeman who had left to do other things two albums prior. It’s only 5 songs but it is full-length. A lot of proggy goodness here. VG+.
- The Who – Face Dances — The 1981 follow-up to the Quadrophenia album in 1979. It has the song “You Better You Bet” and is pretty fine. VG.
- Atlantic Starr – All In The Name Of Love — I will admit that I purchased this (for $2) just because of one song. That song is “Always.” I have always loved it. It serves my R&B Slow Jam sensibilities. VG.
- The Chipmunks – Urban Chipmunk — Yeah, you read that correctly. I’ve had more comments (positive ones) about this album than most any other recently. I even had someone offer to buy it from me already. Why? Because it’s a memory from our childhood. I wanted this when I was a kid and never got it. I had a cousin who had it. My sister had Chipmunk Punk which was a better album, but I wanted both of them. I haven’t found the Punk one and loved finding this one. And, yes, it is as awful as you’d think it would be, but that’s a glorious thing! Even though it was a $1 bin find, it was in VG+ condition.
Underdog Records is THE Official Music Sponsor of The Less Desirables. They have fantastic vinyl choices and players. There are also a few cassettes because apparently, that’s a thing again? Listen to the weekly episode of TLD to hear what the TLD/Underdog Special of the week is. Watch the social media channels for Underdog Records to see what is going freshly onto the sales floor.
I use Discogs to keep track of my collection. I spent a lot of time bin diving with my app on the phone open so I could check that I did or didn’t have the great stuff I was finding.
Until tomorrow, same blog channel…
Scorp out!

“I call you on the telephone my voice too rough with cigarettes. I sometimes feel?” – “You Better You Bet” (Townshend)Tigers sign 3 to open international signing period signed for $300,000, while Nivar signed for $260,000.
The Tigers are expected to be busy this week on the international front. Venezuelan shortstop Alvaro Gonzalez has agreed to terms on a deal with a $1 million bonus, sources told MLB.com's Jesse Sanchez. Detroit is expected to reach an agreement with another highly touted Venezuelan shortstop, Carlos Irigoyen, in the coming days. The Tigers don't announce deals until players have officially signed and contracts have been approved by the Commissioner's Office.
None of the players announced Monday, all 16-year-olds, were ranked. Gonzalez ranked 23rd on MLB Pipeline's list of the top 30 international prospects. Irigoyen ranked 43rd on Baseball America's list of top international prospects.
Acevedo comes out of the Dominican Prospect League, though he wasn't ranked in their elite class of prospects for this summer. Tigers scouts saw very good defensive skills, including a reliable glove and strong arm from the 5-foot-10, 150-pound switch-hitter, along with line-drive power at the plate.
Nivar, listed at 5-foot-10 and 170 pounds, ranked as one of the top prospects out of the Nube Baseball Academy in the Dominican. The right-handed hitter is more of an offensive infielder with above-average bat speed and potential to hit for average with power.
Rodriguez, listed at 6-foot-1 and 170 pounds, is a bigger outfielder for his size and projects to grow with age. That strength reflects in his scouting report, with potential for right-handed power at the plate and a strong arm in the field to stick in a corner-outfield role.
The Tigers have traditionally focused a good portion of their international efforts on Venezuela, where they're one of the few teams to still have an academy for young players. However, they've still found talent in the Dominican, signing current Astros pitcher
According to the new rules established by the most recent Collective Bargaining Agreement, every team gets at least $4.75 million to spend on international prospects. Any team receiving a Competitive Balance Round A pick in the Draft gets $5.25 million in international bonus pool money. Additionally, teams receiving a Competitive Balance Round B pick get $5.75 million to spend.
A club can trade as much of its international pool money as it would like, but there is a limit -- 75 percent of a team's initial pool -- to how much one team can acquired.
Detroit's pool total for this year's signing period is $4.75 million. The Tigers have historically spread their pool money across several prospects rather than hinge most of their fortunes on one high-bonus player. That strategy began with former general manager Dave Dombrowski and has continued under current GM Al Avila.
Jason Beck has covered the Tigers for MLB.com since 2002. Read Beck's Blog, follow him on Twitter @beckjason and listen to his podcast.Being a photographer & graphic designer, I love finding creative ways to capture moments!

International DirectorAs area children head back to school, Feed the Children – a leading anti-hunger organization – will partner with Great Clips to sponsor the NASCAR Nationwide Series Great Clips 300 to Benefit Feed the Children on August 30.
Throughout Labor Day weekend, fans at the Atlanta Motor Speedway will join Great Clips and the non-profit to fill 3,000 backpacks with food, educational supplies and necessities for homeless students.
On August 29 at 2 p.m., NASCAR drivers will open the booth and put their special touch on the first backpacks. Drivers James Buescher, Jeremy Clements, Jamie Dick, Blake Koch, Dylan Kwasniewski, Eric McClure, Ryan Sieg and Brian Scott will visit the Fan Zone to build backpacks alongside fans and NASCAR Hall of Fame Inductee Bill Elliott and his wife, Cindy.
The five-time world champion boxer Evander Holyfield will act as the Honorary Starter of the race. Additionally, singer and musician Bo Bice will sing the National Anthem. Bice was runner-up to Carrie Underwood in the fourth season of American Idol.
Feed the Children believes that nourishing both the bodies and minds of kids will help break the cycle of poverty in the United States, which affects roughly one in five children. In addition to supporting those in need, a booth in The Fan Zone will feature fun activities for kids and kids at heart:
• Great Clips stylists will offer colorful hair painting for festive fans looking to spruce up their look for the race.
• A photo booth will feature a step-and-repeat banner, fun hats and props. Print-outs are available with a donation.
• Guests may also sign up to receive two chance-of-a-lifetime opportunities:On August 30, two recipients and two guests will receive passes to the Nationwide Race Winner’s Circle and a photo with the winning driver and car.
One lucky person will receive two suite tickets to the Sprint Cup race on August 31.
• Race fans will receive a $5 Great Clips coupon with each $3 donation to Feed the Children.
The Fan Zone booth will be open on August 29 from 2 p.m. to 7 p.m. and August 30 – 31 from noon to 7 p.m. EDT. Sprint Cup drivers David Ragan and Reed Sorenson will also visit the booth to build backpacks the afternoon of August 30.
“Together with Great Clips, NASCAR fans and drivers at the Nationwide Series, we will work to fill backpacks full of brand new school supplies for thousands of school-age children in the United States,” said Kevin Hagan, CEO of Feed the Children. “Feed the Children and its partners want to help kids be kids, and success in the classroom begins by offering kids the educational resources they need in addition to access to healthy meals.”
Feed the Children and Great Clips began partnering in early 2014, with salons in the southeast raising $55,000 in support of the non-profit’s backpack program. The Great Clips 300 to Benefit.
“Great Clips is pleased to use our Great Clips 300 Nationwide race as an opportunity to benefit Feed the Children, an organization that helps shine a spotlight on hunger and poverty issues in the United States. We know that race fans are great people who care and we’re eager to offer them a simple, yet meaningful, way to help,” said Dave Randall, Senior Marketing Manager at Great Clips.
The Great Clips partnership comes on the heels of Feed the Children’s recent commitment to unite with like-minded groups to defeat the status quo of hunger. Through this commitment, Feed the Children will challenge conventional anti-hunger initiatives, promote and share best practices with peers and launch new pilot programs to find the most effective solutions – all with the goal of ending childhood hunger and helping kids be kids.

Om je CS700 te upgraden naar een CS700A moet de behuizing van de porto worden geopend en moeten op het PCB twee punten worden kortgesloten en de porto worden aangezet.
Om een CS700 te upgraden naar een CS750 (de firmware voor de amateurversie met front panel programming) moet er een chip worden vervangen in de porto.
In beide gevallen geeft Connect Systems aan dat er risico’s zijn aan het zelf aanpassen van de porto en biedt een mogelijk de porto op te sturen en te laten upgraden. In hoeverre dit ook door de importeur kan worden uitgevoerd is niet duidelijk bij het schijven van dit bericht.

UPGRADING CS700 TO CS700A
AND
UPGRADING CS700 TO CS750
To upgrade from a CS700 to a CS700A requires the following steps:
1. Get a copy of the tuning parameters.
2. Take the radio apart to get to the PCB
3. Short two points on the PCB and turn on Power
4. Load New Driver
5. Load New Firmware
6. Convert new tuning parameters to new turning parameters
7. Use service Monitor to tune certain parameters if necessary
8. Initialize code plug
There are three issues with having the customers do this themselves.
(1) If you make a mistake you might brick the radio and could take at least 4 hours to recover.
(2) If you short the wrong spot on the radio you might damage the radio.
(3) We have no way of protecting our intellectual property from being copied by other manufacturers.
Connect Systems decided that because we cannot have the customers do the upgrading themselves because of the above reasons, we would charge a nominal fee of only $20 including shipping within United States to upgrade an old CS700 to the new CS700A. For customers outside the United States, we will charge $15 plus shipping. For those customers it would be advantageous to ship multiple radios at the same time.
To Convert the CS700 to a CS750 requires the changing of a memory chip. This means unsoldering an existing IC and soldering in a new IC. Then you following the above 8 instructions. For that the price is $60 including shipping. For customers outside the United States, we will charge $55 plus shipping. For those customers it would be advantageous to ship multiple radios at the same time.
To upgrade your radio call (818) 889-0503 after the Dayton Hamvention for a RMA number. With the RMA number, you must include the radio, your return shipping address, and a check or credit card number to cover the cost of upgrade.

CS700A
The CS700A is the old CS700 Hardware with some new firmware. Among some of the features in the first version of the CS700A is programmable Mike Gain and Nuisance Channel Delete. Future updates will have some of the other features I promised a long time ago. If you are happy with the CS700 you have now, there is no compelling reason to upgrade your radio. The outside of the radio is still marked CS700.
————————————————————————————————————-. To order please call (818) 889 0503

COMPATABILITY WITH OTHER VENDORS RADIOS
The firmware that will load in the CS700A and CS750 will not load in any of the radios that is sold by Quantun Electronics or any other vendors. Some of the Ham Friendly features in our radios are being written by Connect Systems and will not be available in our competitors products.

CS300 Radio for Visually Impaired
Summary
The purpose of the this radio is to achieve two things:
(1) Have a radio that is ideally suited for the vision impaired population.
(2) Have a test bed to test some of the concepts for the CS7000 multi-protocol radio.
Background
Early in the development of the CS7000, I promised some Hams that the CS7000 will be ideally suited for the Hams that are visually impaired. It is now time to meet that promise and develop an inexpensive test bed to prove the concepts
I decided that it might make sense to take the CS100 radio and partially rewrite the firmware to achieve this purpose. This radio is a top of the line commercial radio that is every bit as good as the Motorola commercial radios. Once the development and testing is completed for this radio, and it has been in the field tested by visually impaired Hams, the feedback will allow the CS7000 to have a fully optimized visually impaired radio at a reasonable price.
Other Advantages
Beside being designed for the visually impaired, this radio will have other advantages and features that might interest the larger Amateur Radio Community.
(1) This radio will be ideally suited for emergency operations where the lighting is too low to easily operate a normal radio.
(2) This radio will be programmed without having a computer.
(3) This radio will have special macro features that will allow the average HAM to program the radio to do functions no other radio can do. As an example, the user can program the radio to wake him up at a predetermined time, then transmit a wake-up call to someone else along with his call sign, then put the radio into a receive mode to listen for normal radio traffic, then start the coffee maker. It can also be used to automatically generate a distress call or dial a phone number through a phone patch and leave a message.
(4) Because the radio is designed for the visually impaired, wide use of voice prompts will have to be used. This radio will allow the user to program the voice in any language.

Holt strike stuns Arsenal
Norwich recorded a deserved first Barclays Premier League win under new manager Chris Hughton as lacklustre Arsenal were beaten 1-0 at Carrow Road.
Norwich keeper John Ruddy, pictured, celebrates after Grant Holt scored [PA].
Norwich did not resemble a team which had shipped 17 goals in their previous seven games and looked much more of an attacking threat with Wes Hoolahan tucked in behind Holt.
The Canaries were in front in the 20th minute. Alex Tettey let fly from 25 yards across a skiddy surface and Vito Mannone - again deputising for injured number one Wojciech Szczesny - parried the ball back out into the six-yard box, where Holt was quickest to react ahead of Per Mertesacker and stab home.
Carl Jenkinson hacked clear as Anthony Pilkington was set to shoot at an unguarded net, while centre-back Michael Turner planted a free header wide.
At the other end, Gervinho was picked out by an angled free-kick from Mikel Arteta, but completely missed the ball.
The Gunners broke quickly after 51 minutes with Jenkinson's cross palmed away by John Ruddy - but Olivier Giroud could only hook the loose ball wide.
Wenger had seen enough and Lukas Podolski was replaced by England midfielder Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. Oxlade-Chamberlain picked up what looked like a hip problem and had to be replaced by Andrey Arshavin after less than 10 minutes.
Holt capitalised on a slip by Thomas Vermaelen on the half-way line to rush clear - only to then float a tame chip at the keeper with Hoolahan unmarked to his left. Arteta's low strike was held by Ruddy as Norwich closed out a hard-earned first league win.OTC Nasal Decongestant Recalled for Contamination
August 8, 2018 (empr.com) An over-the-counter nasal decongestant has been recalled due to microbial contamination, according to an online news story from empr.com.
The recall affects one lot of CVS Health 12-Hour Sinus Relief Nasal Mist (oxymetazoline HCI 0.05%). The product was found to be contaminated with pseudomonas aeruginosa. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a gram-negative bacteria that can cause serious infections in people, especially children and people who are immunocompromised.
The nasal decongestant is sold at CVS Pharmacy stores under the CVS Health brand and bears the lot number 173089J. It has an expiration date of 09/19 and is packaged in 0.5 fluid ounce bottles. Use of the contaminated spray can lead to colonization and infection, which can be potentially life-threatening. At this time, however, no reports of illness due to contaminated nasal decongestant have been received.
Consumers with questions about their products can contact Product Quest (the manufacturing company) by calling (386) 239-8787.

Utah collects a standings point to extend their unbeaten streak to 10-straight games at 8-0-0-2 in that stretch.
“We have to learn from this,” said head coach and General Manager Tim Branham. “We got a point out of it. We can draw even with those guys tomorrow (in the standings); nothing less is acceptable.”
The Grizzlies held three one-goal leads in the game starting 7:13 into the first period when Michael Pelech centered Austin Ortega (17) as Mitch Maxwell skated down a puck.
Utah took a 2-1 lead on Taylor Richart’s 16th goal of the season 48 seconds after Allen tied the game at 1-1 as the Grizzlies reclaimed the lead with 59 seconds left in the first period. Brad Navin extended his scoring streak to 10 as Ortega added another assist.
Allen scored two quick ones in the first 3:18 of the second period to build a 3-2 lead as it opened the scoring 37 seconds in.
“At the end of the day, we scored four goals, gave up only 22 shots (and) had no full power plays. I thought we battled hard. We got down in the second period (but) found a way to come back,” said Branham.
The Grizzlies countered 3:39 later as Ryan Misiak (13) knocked home a puck sent to the net from the corner by Brendan Harms as Ryan Walters won a battle along the wall.
Utah took a 4-3 lead as Michael Pelech slipped home his 16th of the year as he played catch with Ortega (one goal, two assists), and Gage Ausmus also picked up an assist with 7:06 left in the second period.
The Americans tied the game at 4-4, 6:04 into the third period on a breakaway as Vincent Arseneau (two goals, one assist) knocked a puck free at the Allen blue line.
The Grizzlies killed two late penalties to force overtime before Allen scored in all three rounds of the shootout as Brad Navin was Utah’s only scorer.
“I'm proud of our penalty kill,” said Branham. “We did a good job of that. We scored four goals, which is usually good enough at this time of year, but we need to crack down a little more.”
Joel Rumpel, who is at 8-1-0-2 with Utah, stopped 18-of-22 shots.
Saturday is the final Postgame Skate with the Grizzlies of the season after their game with Allen at 7 p.m.YUN Brewing Pub

Fermanagh SFC Final
DERRYGONNELLY HARPS 2-16 EDERNEY ST JOSEPH'S 0-10
By Conor McKenna at Brewster Park, Enniskillen
Derrygonnelly Harps were crowned Fermanagh Senior Football Champions for the fourth year in succession after a comprehensive and fully deserved 12 points victory over Ederney St. Joseph’s.
Fermanagh football has made massive strides this year reaching an Ulster final for the first time since 2008, overcoming Monaghan in the semi-final and there was plenty of talent on show from both sides, with both teams well able to convert when presented with chances.
The victors opted to leave corner-forward Paul Ward up top on his own for large periods, with Conall Jones and Gary McKenna supporting Ward when the opportunity presented itself.
Both teams were aiming to get a quick counter-attacking move motoring when given the opportunity with fitness playing a massive part in this game.
Ryan Jones’ first half goal was the difference between the teams at the break, as Jones made a surge towards goal and was able to put the ball past the Ederney defenders on the line, who attempted to clear, but ultimately the referee decided that the ball had crossed the line which was the correct decision.
Ryan Jones and namesake Garvan impressed for Derrygonnelly in the opening half, with the reigning champions looking sharper and more clinical when in possession.
St. Joseph’s certainly did not lack heart and an excellent score from veteran midfielder Marty McGrath gave his side a 0-3 to 0-1 advantage early on.
Jones’s goal appeared to be the momentum changer, as the victors were in control from this point onwards and it was always going to be a difficult task for St. Joeseph’s after the goal.
An excellent effort from Chris Snow left the deficit at three points at half-time with the scoreboard reading 1-7 to 0-7 in favour of Derrygonnelly.
The second half was very one-sided with Paul Ward receiving a quickly-taken long range free and turning his marker, before finishing past the onlooking goalkeeper.
Derrygonnelly completely dominated thereafter, with St. Joseph’s fading away.
Harps added a series of quickfire points after the goal to kill off the game and lift the cup for the fourth year in succession, with Ryan Jones picking up a black card late on, to exit the pitch after a fantastic individual performance, with Jones lifting the trophy much to the delight of the Derrygonnelly support.
Scorers for Derrygonnelly Harps: Paul Ward 1-3, Garvan Jones 0-5 (3fs), Ryan Jones 1-2, Conall Jones (1f) 0-3 each, Gary McKenna 0-2 (1f) Neil Gallagher 0-1.

On June 29, shortly after 1 a.m., members of the Kelowna RCMP were conducting a check stop on Harvey Avenue at Water Street for eastbound highway traffic.
The driver of a black Chevy Cavalier, a 32-year-old West Kelowna woman, was unable to produce a driver’s licence. Further investigation to determine ownership of the vehicle made police suspicious of the driver and her male passenger.
A search of the vehicle revealed 79 quarter-gram packages of meth, heroin, powder cocaine and crack cocaine as well as $175 cash and paraphernalia consistent with the trafficking of drugs.
The woman, and a 32-year-old Lake Country man, were both arrested for possession for the purpose of trafficking.
They were both released on a promise to appear for court at a later date.If you're into all things Japanese you should check out Play'n GO's new Matsuri slot. The game manages to bring a cute looking feminine Japanese cultural feel to the reels, while also ensuring that there's enough features present to give you the chance to win big.
Matsuri is a 5 reel, 25 payline video slot that is based in Japan and is backset against a city on the water at night. This gives you a really neat look, which is among the better atmospheres I've seen recently. The game's symbols include cat masks, lanterns, Japanese girls, flowers, fans, goldfish, dumplings, and shave ice.
Feature wise, the game includes wild symbols, expanding wilds, scatter symbols, walking wilds, and free spins. The game also has a posted Return to Player (RTP) percentage of 96.2%, which is considered to be solid for an online slot machine.
Having spent some time playing Matsuri, I found the game to be charming and full of life. Play'n GO always does a nice job of putting together slot themes, and they've really hit the mark here. The game simply looks fantastic. The features in the game also work to make the title a ton of fun. I worked out many wild expansions on the reels, which saved my bacon more than once to turn a losing spin into a big winner. Additionally, the free spins mode is wonderful and also helped to boost my bankroll.
Matsuri is one of Play'n GO's slots that can also be played on your mobile device. The game performs equally well on either device. Playing it on the go is a lot of fun, and I can't say anything bad about the game's mobile version.
If you're looking to play an Asian themed video slot, you could certainly do a lot worse than Matsuri. It's a fun game that looks great and has a ton of features.
Great game and i like this game, asian theme with quite good feature, but the payout its quite low and less perfect, i get feature with total win only 40x from total bet,.. But i like with wild,.
Matsuri is a really extraordinary game, I think that Playn Go has done a wonderful job in terms of design. I played it recently at Slotjoint casino with minimum stakes and managed to score a few nice hits. I would recommend it as it is great for low rollers.
I am not huge fan of asian themed slots but Matsuri is one of my favorite from those. Bonus game in most cases pays small, just once i won mega win. Free spins mode is much better for me. I love wild reels and sometimes i am lucky to hit even 3 of them and yellow light is shinning into my eyes counting my money:)

Quintus Prime of the 13.
An odd egg-shaped figure he is associated with the studies of science, remembered as a perfectionist he often butted heads with the other 12 Primes.
Figure 1
The Sigil of Quintus, often engraved into scientific equipment as if asking for his several optics to see the answer and act through the equipment. There is usually at least one symbol in every lab, it is also not uncommon for his sigil to appear in medical rooms as well.
Figure 2
Depictions of Quintus are something humans would call ‘wild’ and ‘bizarre’ but, hey, they’re aliens, who cares what we think?. 5 legs, 5 optics and 5 foldable arms that can be tucked away, they say Quintus used these to perform multiple tests at once, looking around with his flexible neck.
Figure 3
Robes worn by “Quintus collective” a group of mechs you could in a joking manner refer to as “science nuns” but they’re not really. They are a collection of intelligent mechs who live in Quintus Hall with many joining their ranks upon proving their value as members of the scientific community. It is here they vow to lock away anything deemed ‘useless’ in the pursuit of science and withhold from any kind of relationship with other beings, in favour of spending endless cycles reading and cataloguing through a grandoise collection of scientific knowledge and performing new experiments.
In the past they were responsible for many scientific breakthroughs and members of their council usually played judge and juror on new invetions and similar things. However, in modern days their numbers are few as applications to become a member have dwindled dramatically. Mechs these days want to keep their distracting emotions and attachments around no matter how badly they mess up scientific progress, tch idiots.
The group has wound down into a small group composed of two types of mechs, the ones who have decided their role should change and merely record as much progress as possible and the ones who have gotten a more “holier than thou” attitude about the whole thing and are cold to “the outsiders who forsoke our ways” rather than accept their traditions were getting old and stale.
They officially all died, as well as most of their records, during the war. They refused to partake, viewing it as pointless and often turned down even the Autobots offers of protection, wanting to be left entirely out of it. This, naturally, didn’t work out for them as Megatron and the other Decepticons hunted them down and killed them all, burning centuries of ‘sacred’ knowledge.
In particular they were hunted down like animals by the cold Shockwave when they refused to join him. Shockwave had some delusions about being Quintus’s true ‘disciple’, an idea laced into his processor by Megatron as a final ‘lock and seal’ to stop Shockwave from making any attempt at holding onto emotions. An act that finally broke the cyclops into the emotionless, logical being we know today. Something Spark-crushing to Wheeljack and Perceptor, Shockwave’s old friends, Perceptor had even pondered joining this group one day as well.We are happy to announce that a research paper developed under the mF2C Project, has been accepted for presentation in the IEEE 14th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob), to be held on 15-17 October 2018 in Limassol, Cyprus
Title “Towards a context-aware Wi-Fi-based Fog Node discovery scheme using cellular footprints”,
by Zeineb Rejiba*, Xavier Masip-Bruin*, Eva Marín-Tordera*
* Advanced Network Architectures Lab (CRAAX), Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC), Spain
Abstract:
Recently, new computing paradigms such as fog and edge computing started to emerge in an attempt to cope with the low latency requirements of new classes of IoT applications.
In order for these paradigms to fully realize their potential, an important challenge to address is the discovery of fog nodes (FNs) with spare computational resources that can be used to host timesensitive and computationally intensive application components.
We particularly focus on this problem in this paper, considering the case of a WiFi-based FN discovery process. More specifically, we evaluate how practical it is to trigger the discovery of fog
nodes based on a mobile phone’s historical cellular footprints in order to obtain a high discovery rate and a low energy overhead.
To this end, we conducted a small-scale cellular data collection to be used to test different learning approaches, including the K-Nearest Neighbors and the decision tree algorithms as well as a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). According to our evaluation results, HMM was found to achieve the maximum discovery and energy saving ratios. The impact of initial FN misdetections on the user-FN contact ratio has also been studied.Skunk Kush Regular

Skunk Kush® Regular by Sensi Seeds looks like an Afghan plant but features a higher content of resin and an improved flowering time. Nuances are always fruity, including grapefruit, orange, lime and lemon.
By buying this product you can collect up to 7 loyalty points. Your cart will total 7 points that can be converted into a voucher of 1,40 €.
Product description
Skunk® Kush Regular by Sensi Seeds is the result of a combination between two of the most fundamental and prestigious strains to ever come out of the Dutch seed bank; a powerful Skunk#1 and a resinous male Afghan (Hindu Kush). This hybrid combines the best parts of both strains, creating plants that are perfect for both indoors and out.
Indoors the best idea is to probably grow using a SoG method, as this strain usually does best in these types of environments, giving up to 450g per meter squared with 6 healthy plants. Once they begin flowering, you’ll see how their calyxes begin lining up and filling with resin, opening up to give way to the abundant resin inherited from the Kush genes. They take about 50 days to flower, although the stalk stretches out to almost double the length before flowering.
If grown outdoors, these plants do pretty well. They take on the shape of a candelabra with a long central stalk that can be up to 1.5m long. They should be ready by mid-September thanks to their Hindu Kush genes, shortening the flowering period considerably. You can get up to 450g per plant if you keep an eye out for deficiencies, given that this strain is a tad peculiar with fertilizers. Its leaves are dark green, and they sprout vigorously; typically Skunk. Its calyxes swell as the flowering period advances, and you can almost see every little speck of resin right up until harvesting.
Its flavors are a mix of earthy Skunk and citric Afghan notes; although some phenotypes manage to give off a mint-lemon taste that free up your lungs. Once you inhale, you’ll begin noticing the strong indica effect; relaxing and pleasing. Perfect for social and recreational use.
- Sativa/Indica: 40/60%
- Flowering: 45-50 days indoors, mid-September outdoors.
- Height: 1-1.5m indoors, 1.3-2m outdoors.

With flu-like symptoms that can appear long after being bitten by an infected tick, it is often difficult to pinpoint the root cause of the symptoms. We reviewed a few of the most common Lyme disease symptoms you may be experiencing in a previous post, and in today’s post, we’ll continue to outline and explain the symptoms of Lyme disease.

Cognitive Disturbances
Cognitive problems are among the most serious symptoms of Lyme disease. The Lyme bacteria can affect nerve endings and disrupt connections within the brain, leading to memory loss, concentration problems, and a general feeling that you are not quite as sharp as you once were. If you find it difficult to remember familiar names, recall momentous occasions, or process simple information, then you should make an appointment with our holistic health center so that we can review your symptoms.

While neurological problems are certainly not flu-like symptoms, headaches and sensitivity to light most definitely are. Many patients who come to our holistic health center find themselves experiencing headaches shortly after waking up, or throughout the day as they are exposed to light. While the prevalence of Lyme disease is vastly underreported by the CDC and other national health agencies, light sensitivity is estimated to be a symptom in roughly 16 percent of confirmed cases. Blurry and impaired vision were reported by roughly 13 percent of Lyme patients.
Heart Problems
Lyme bacteria can make their way into the heart’s tissue, causing a symptom known as Lyme carditis. While most people with Lyme carditis can recover with an effective Lyme treatment plan, the CDC has attributed several deaths to this condition. The symptoms can range from moderate to severe and include, but are not limited to:
- Sudden chest pain
- Lightheadedness
- Shortness of breath
- Racing heart
- Heart palpitations
Face Paralysis
Just as Lyme can affect the heart and brain, it can also affect the nerves in your face. Facial palsy is a late-stage symptom of Lyme disease that occurs when the facial muscles have been damaged by the bacteria. The symptoms of Lyme-caused facial palsy are often confused with the symptoms of a stroke, making this serious symptom even more difficult to treat.
If you have been bitten by a tick, or if you have been trying to treat Lyme disease through conventional medical avenues without results, then call Ozark Holistic Center to schedule an appointment. Our holistic health center provides tick testing and Lyme disease treatment plans in Fayetteville that can help you manage your symptoms and get back to living your life.Background Marijuana Dispensaries In Sacramento California

Government officials state that it will require some time to legalize marijuana. It takes approximately a year, while their risks are explored by government health workers. Adults are allowed to possess 30 grams of marijuana. Also, individuals are allowed to grow marijuana in their homes on a small scale – 4 crops each household depending on the state or territory they live in.

One thought on “Enmities”
Enmity is also the result of wilful and culpable sin against a person and in many circumstances is followed by the racca contempt of the wrong doer. Raca contempt is an expression of one’s spiritual condemnation before God and an actual indicator of such enmity. Great thoughts here, Neal.USA Flag Print

High quality craftsmanship7/25/2017
This is a very nice case, a bit expensive but you definitely get what you pay for. When I put this case on my phone, many people comment on how nice it is. Only thing I don't like about this traveller case are the buttons, they are flat when they should be protruded out so I can feel them better. Other than that, awesome.

Postbaccalaureate certificate
Master's degreeA five year old boy from Northern Ireland found an unlikely surprise while playing with his eight year old brother June 1. He discovered a plastic container belonging to a Kinder Egg, the popular chocolate treat known for its small toy found within the bright yellow container and chocolate shell.
Photo courtesy of wikipedia.org
Expecting to find a figurine inside, the boy opened the egg. But instead, he found a bag of white powder.
Thankfully, the boy immediately told his father who then called the police. After some testing, the bag was found to be filled with methamphetamine. Yes, the same drug featured in “Breaking Bad.”
In a Facebook post, the Limavady Police Department stated that they would dispose of the small bag of drugs. Inspector Colin Shaw added that finding meth where children can easily find it is “deeply concerning.”
Kinder Surprise Eggs are banned in the US by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Consumer Product Safety Administration (CPSA). This is due to concerns about food that contains non-food items, which is a potential safety hazard.
Photo courtesy of canada.com
Americans do find ways around the ban, however. Some people smuggle the eggs in from other countries or buy them from Amazon sellers. Popular memes and ads also poke fun at the ban.
Despite the ban and safety concerns in the US, they are very popular in most of the other countires in the world.
However, you don’t have to go outside of America to legally try a treasure egg. A company called “ChocoTreasure” has worked with the FDA and CPSA to create a “treasure egg” that satisfies both government agencies. They are similar to Kinder Eggs, but their plastic shells can be seen by anyone that tears the wrapper off.
With this new safety measure, Americans can finally enjoy treasure eggs legally in their own country.Working today to change tomorrow!

Integrating Workfront with a POP Email Account
If your organization uses POP for email delivery, you must configure Workfront to allow your POP users to respond to email notifications sent from Workfront.
NOTE We strongly advise users to create a POP email address that is solely dedicated to replying to Workfront email. Using a personal POP username can cause severe issues with your system.
Plus addressing (such as yourname+organization@organization.com) is not supported for users commenting on Workfront objects via email.
The following prerequisites are required in order to set up a POP account in Workfront:
- A unique POP account is associated with this setup.
- The POP account is not linked to a Workfront user account.
- The POP account email address is solely dedicated for the purpose of responding to Workfront emails.
NOTE Using a personal POP username can cause severe issues.
Some customized POP configurations have been known to not work correctly with Workfront in supporting this functionality. Contact your email system administrator to understand why a POP account might not correctly support this feature in Workfront.
Setting Up a POP Account in Workfront
In order to integrate POP with Workfront, you need to set up the POP account to handle incoming communication from Workfront.

- Click Email > Setup.
The Email Setup page is displayed.
- In the Incoming Mail section, select POP Email Account.
- Specify the following information:
Email Address: The email address of the POP account you are using.
WARNING You should not use a personal email address as the POP username. Instead, you should create a new email address that is solely dedicated for this purpose. Using a personal POP username can cause severe issues.

The POP account may be disabled for the following reasons:
- Workfront tries to connect to the POP account and the connection fails more than 25 consecutive times. After 25 failed attempts, the POP account setup is disabled in Workfront.
- Workfront connects to the POP account and finds 10 or more emails in the POP account that are not related to comments in Workfront. In this case, Workfront stops processing emails for the account and sends the following notification to the system administrator:
"We encountered a problem while processing emails from your POP account: <POP email address>. We either found emails that are not related to Workfront comments, or something might be wrong with your POP credentials. Please ensure that the email credentials configured under Setup > Email > Setup are valid and that the email address is used only for Workfront communication."
Workfront starts checking the account again after five minutes.
NOTE Workfront recommends that you use this POP account for Workfront communication only. Any other emails could potentially disable the connection between Workfront and the POP account.
If you are a system administrator and you enable the email notification "An error was found that needs my attention", you receive an email notification that the POP account was disabled. For more information on enabling email notifications, see "Configuring Email Notifications."
Removing the Signature Line From POP Email
If your POP email client supports user signatures placed in a location other than the bottom of an email, your signature might display in the Updates tab of objects to which you add comments via a response to an email notification.
You can prevent your signature from appending to comments you make by inserting in your email response a string of characters called a signature delimiter.
- Within the email notification, choose to reply to the email.
A reply window is opened.
- Compose your comment.
- Above your signature, type "-- " (dash, dash, space), all on the same line.
The following is an example of the signature delimiter in place:
- Click Send.

Removers of offices and companies - only with us !!!A bit of early info...
Not much in the way of images yet, but we have a decent bit of information from the upcoming issue of V-Jump!
First up, since we have the image. ReArise will have an Omegamon event along with bringing in various Adventure Digimon for the upcoming 20th anniversary. The 20th Anniversary content will include movie, 02, and tri. Digimon.
And Linkz is also showing off various X-Antibody Royal Knights, including Jesmon X.
As for what we don't have images of...
First up is Digimon Adventure 20th related stuff.
Beginning March 6th (the release date of the original Adventure film), the Digimon Adventure 20th Anniversary Project will officially begin.
It appears the new V-Jump also has a new memorial image for the 20th Anniversary project, which we hope to have soon. (Assuming this isn't a mistranslation for something to be released on the 6th. It's also possible it's in V-Jump as a preview with the image being released elsewhere on the 6th.)
Also on March 6th, Village Vanguard will begin a collaboration event. They previously have had a number of exclusive Digimon items.
A collaboration with GraffArt is beginning on March 20th. GraffArts is a hobby store and cafe, so what form the collaboration might take will be interesting to see, but it's mentioned that there will be many limited edition products.
Plus yet another collaboration has been announced, this time with Tower Records Cafe.
So plenty of Adventure 20th stuff is coming soon!
On top of the Adventure 20th info, we get an update on Digimon Survive.
Survive is still in the midst of development and a number of system changes have been made to improve gameplay. No further information is available for now.
Interestingly there is no specific information (as of yet) if this equates to a delay, or just an explanation for the long run of silence regarding Survive lately.
More V-Jump info and images soon hopefully.
Thanks to ayushi for the translation, a Weibo user for the image, and ryokutya2089 for the other info.
Update- More from a new V-Jump issue thanks to akatuki_d30.

James Corden Wants The Spice Girls To Do Carpool Karaoke
15 March 2018, 15:33 | Updated: 4 November 2018, 10:
The 'Late Late Show' host has had just about every star appear on the famed karaoke sketch, but could Spice Girls have their very first reunion on the show?
Emma Bunton has been asked by James Corden to have a Spice Girls reunion on Carpool Karaoke.
The Heart presenter has been at the centre of speculation as to whether she is set to reform with her fellow bandmates Victoria Beckham, Melanie Brown, Melanie Chisholm and Geri Horner, and while there is no confirmation they will ever tour again James Corden is keen for a reunion.
'Peter Rabbit' star James Corden paid a trip to visit Emma in the Heart studios and wasn't shy about asking whether she would be up for taking part in Carpool Karaoke with the girls.
Watch the video below to see what she says!
The news comes after Emma reunited with her Spice Girls bandmates for a lunch at Geri Horner's house in January, prompting speculation they could get back together.
However, Emma revealed on Heart that the group had just been "catching up" and reminiscing on old times.
All the girls posted this picture to their Instagram handles. It was the first time they have all been in the same room since 2012.
Could they be taking on the passenger seat in James Corden's Range Rover? We'll watch this space.CAREERS

President Trump's threat to impose tariffs on an additional $200 billion in Chinese goods, followed by Beijing's swift vow to retaliate, has jangled investor nerves and elicited concern from a range of industries. But the biggest losers in a full-blown trade war would likely be American consumers – here's why:
The cost of electronics, clothes, toys and other goods would rise
The higher the U.S. tariffs are on imported goods like computer chips and fabric, the more likely American companies that import Chinese components are to raise prices to offset their own higher costs. That means consumers would have to pay more for a wide range of goods, economists say.
As Louis Kuijs of Oxford Economics notes, a large share of China's exports are for U.S. companies that sell products here at home.
"No way you get there without putting tariffs on a lot of consumer goods imports, be it computers -- cell phones or apparel (clothes)/ toys/ small household appliances and the like," Brad Setser, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said in a series of tweets on Mr. Trump's move to up the ante on China.
Even U.S. companies that don't import parts or products from China would likely boost their prices
That's because as prices on imported goods rise, domestic firms typically charge more too. In other words, while buying products "made in the USA" might benefit local manufacturers, consumers would feel the pinch.
Middle- and lower-income Americans would be most affected because they spend more of their disposable income on consumer goods.
For example, if Trump were to enact proposed tariffs on foreign cars, automakers like Ford and GM could also raise their prices. That's exactly what happened in the 1980s when President Ronald Reagan increased tariffs on Japanese cars.
The "consumer pays more, not just more for imported cars, but domestic cars," said Michelle Casario, an assistant professor of economics at Villanova University. "The benefits are limited to the actual firm and the costs are spread throughout to consumers."
A trade war might wipe out any gains Americans get from the 2017 tax overhaul
Some economists say a trade war could cancel out faster economic growth from last year's tax cuts, while rising prices would effectively eat up the small tax windfall most Americans got. The situation would worsen if Mr. Trump followed through on his threats to withdraw from NAFTA, which would reduce trade in North America and further boost costs as supplies of some goods shrank.
Sinking investor confidence could depress market returns for average Americans
Wall Street is growing increasingly concerned with deteriorating trade relations between the U.S. and China, with the Dow's latest decline putting the blue-chip index in the red for 2018. If financial markets continue to sputter, so would people's retirement funds.
One reason investors are worried: corporate leaders are too.
Even before Mr. Trump threatened to escalate the tariff fight with China, CEO confidence in economic growth was ebbing. A June monthly survey of 272 U.S. business leaders by Chief Executive magazine found growing fear about global conflict on trade matters.Calculate your Basal Metabolic Rate with Smart BMR Calculator

With cosmetic surgical procedures becoming increasingly cheap and accessible, having the appearance you've always wanted is no longer the vaunt of the young population. And since male pattern baldness is at the top of the list of things men would like to change about their looks, it's no wonder that the hair transplant is becoming one of the most popular solution to hair loss which appear to be mostly a hereditary problem., eyelashes, and pubic hair and to fill in the hairless scars caused by accidents, surgery or burns.
Method
Hair follicles are harvested from a donor area that has healthy, bald-resistance hair, and moved to the recipient area, where they are re-established in as natural a growing pattern as possible. The donor area is usually the back part of the head, where a strip of skin and hair can be removed, and the scar can be hidden in the natural creases of the scalp, and by re-growth of surrounding hair.
The strip is then cut into small tiny pieces, and re-grafted onto the recipient area. In an even more advanced procedure called follicular unit transplantation, individual follicle units are removed from the donor area rather than a strip, and the follicles, complete with as much of their glands and blood supply as possible, are individually grafted onto the bald area..

June 1, 2016
Although similar to copying a creature, copying a spell can be a little tricky. In this week’s judge tips, we are going to look at the steps to copying a spell and what to do when that spell resolves or is countered.
Like we always do, let’s go to the CR! For copying a spell, we turn to CR.
That’s a lot! Let’s break it down.
If you cast Cryptic Command and then I copy it with a spell that states I can choose new targets for the copy, what can I do? Cryptic Command is a modal spell and, according to the above CR, we know the modes are copied. No change there; however, since I can select the target of my copy, I can make some choices.
This means, if you chose the modes countering a spell and drawing a card, my copy allows me to select a new target for my spell and draw a card. I can’t choose any other mode as that decision is locked in.
What happens if I copy a spell that has X in its casting cost? Well, like the modes, that decision is locked in. So no changing the value of X.
It may sound redundant but, it’s important to remember “A copy of a spell or ability copies both the characteristics of the spell or ability and all decision made for it, including modes, targets, the value of X, and additional or alternative costs.”
Not too difficult, right?
So what happens when that copy resolves? Well, since it isn’t a real card, it can’t exist anywhere besides the stack.
Let’s look at CR 706.10B “If a copy if a spell is in a zone other than the stack, it ceases to exist. … this is a state-based action.”
Basically, when the spell leaves the stack, state-based actions will check and the copy will cease to exist. It’s very similar to tokens changing zones.
Do copies of spells trigger things that trigger when a spell is cast? Something like prowess? Well, that depends. If you use something like Isochron Scepter you are actually copying the card and casting. This means Prowess will trigger; however, if you copy a spell with something like Twincast, the spell is put directly on the stack and is not cast. This means no prowess trigger.
CR706 rule 601, “Casting spells” and then the copy becomes cast. Once cast, the copy is a spell on the stack, and just like any other spell it can resolve or be countered.
It should be noted, when we copy something it’s like we are making a photocopy of the object. This is true if we are copying creatures or spells.

- There's a running joke in the world of product management that our job is to hold meetings. Of course, it's not entirely true, but any person in a product role will definitely spend more time in meetings than not. And let's face it, meetings have a pretty bad reputation. Whether it's the mundane unnecessary status update meetings or brainstorming meetings where nothing actually really gets done, meetings can be distracting and carve out valuable minutes of your day. On the flip side, any team leader who knows how and when to hold a meeting will not only be much more productive themselves, but earn the respect and productivity of their team as well.
Let's discuss a few ways to make sure you're always making the most of meetings. First, let me stress one thing. The best meeting is one that doesn't exist. Have you ever seen a coworker with the famous mug that says, "I survived another meeting that should have been an email"? Yeah, you probably have, and there's a reason why it's so popular. Before creating a meeting invite ask yourself, can this be addressed with an email, chat, or even a quick talk in person? If the answer to any of those is yes, then do not under any circumstances schedule that meeting.
Things that fall under this category include things like status updates, weekly check-ins, and specific one-off requests. All right, so let's say that you really do need that team meeting. What do you do next? Do you send a note inviting your entire team to gather them in the conference room? No, think long and hard about who really needs to attend your meeting. Only invite team members who are accountable for the topic at hand. The smaller the meeting, the more effective it will be. Now, before pressing Send on that meeting invite, make sure you have a clear-cut, tight agenda. To create one, ask yourself questions like, what's the final outcome of this meeting? And working backwards, what needs to be discussed to accomplish the final outcome? Map out this information in an organized way and include it in the description of the invite.
This way everyone knows what they're getting into and they'll have their ideas and solutions ready prior to stepping into the room. Once your meeting is in session, make sure you do all you can to start and end on time, with bonus points for ending early. What's the best way to do that though? Well, just ensure you abide by your own agenda. Take ownership of your meeting and move things along accordingly. Be sure to front-load high priority items, ask good questions to other presenters, and politely interject to cut to the point if someone goes off-topic. And trust me, someone always goes off-topic.
The last and most important part of a meeting is the follow-up action. Make sure you or a designated colleague is taking the right notes. The last thing a team member wants is a long scroll of all the dialogue that took place in the meeting. You're not a court reporter, after all. An effective follow-up starts with a clear email or document assigning accountability to each stakeholder with clear and agreed upon timelines. Short, sweet, and effective. I can't stress enough that the best meeting is one that doesn't exist. But if one is really actually necessary, do these simple things, and I promise you'll improve your work life, as well as the work life of everyone else around you.

Australia's waste problem
- 64m tonnes waste generated in Australia per year
- 37m tonnes waste sent to landfill per year
- 2.7 tonnes waste generated per person annually
Facts & figures
More waste is being produced than ever before. Through nationwide research and industry partnerships, we can transform this waste into reusable materials and move towards a circular economy.
We have a whole-systems thinking approach towards a circular economy, in which resource extraction, materials production and end-of-life processing form a closed loop with minimal waste.
With our expertise in process intensification, we have developed new technologies that are now utilised in small, modular plants that process waste at its source, producing valuable niche products. With the help of industry and government, we want to apply these advanced manufacturing methods to transform the waste industry in urban and regional areas.
Designing technology to recover useful chemicals from waste water streams such as sewage or mine-tailings dams.
We are pursuing basic and applied research in membrane science and technology for waste water applications. Specific research interests include:
This project focuses on developing novel processes to extract value from waste water through biological conversions into high-value products. We are using various microorganisms (algae, fungi, bacteria, yeast) to produce biopharmaceutical, health care and nutritional products (for example, PUFAs, carotenoid pigments, cholesterol-lowering drugs, vitamins, and nutraceticals). To do this we are using a suite of technologies:
Using technologies to re-process biological waste products from landfill to create high energy density fuels.
This project utilises the hydrothermal liquefaction pilot plant at the School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering. This is a continuous-flow kilo-scale research facility and the first of its kind in Australia. It converts organic and other solid matter including waste plastics into fuels and chemicals under hydrothermal conditions, submerging them in water up to 300 degrees Celsius and subjecting them to pressure equivalent to up to 250 atmospheres. This project addresses challenges associated with feedstock handling, preparation and standardisation using our feedstock preparation facilities. The plant has converted various biomass feeds (including algae starch crops, aquatic plants, woods and grass) into bio-crudes. It is now in this project being used for testing MSW feedstock blends.
The resulting products will be further refined through catalytic processes using our novel catalysts in reactions such as reforming, hydrotreating, gasification, pyrolysis and transesterification. We will produce various high value fuels and chemicals with targeted and precise properties.
There is a well-known problem with the accuracy and completeness of waste data in Australia. In this project, we are applying analytic techniques to waste management at a national level, starting with Organics and MSW data. The development of mobile applications to track household or business waste and map waste at council level manage their individual waste.
Being able to reprocess waste products from one or more industies into useful items such as building materials is an important area of waste minimisation. The goal of this research area is to find more novel and large-scale waste recovery options.
The WTX project will reprocess waste products from one or more industries (power generation, mining, steel, glass, aluminum, agricultural) into various useful materials such as construction industry products. The goal of this project is to identify novel and large-scale routes for converting carbonated blends of industrial waste, and novel product formulations of X construction materials with targeted specially properties. For example, we have developed processes to transform fly-ash into a new cement blend, utilising fly ash and carbon dioxide wastes from power plants to produce future sustainable construction materials. We are also using advanced 3D printing manufacturing techniques to integrate product design (ink) with application requirements.
To minimise wastes and emissions from industrial manufacturing, we are using our enterprise-wide models to design future industrial ecology eco-parks. This requires systems approaches where energy and materials are recovered and recycled in a highly-integrated manner, achieved through the use of optimization methods, accurate techno-economic estimation and life cycle analysis. The result is a blue print for a future bio-manufacturing hub that maximises efficiencies and minimises wastes and emissions.
Recovering valuable resources from electronic waste products, and from emerging industries, e.g. renewable energy and energy storage.
In this project we are investigating the mechanisms of e-waste bioleaching and hydropyrolysis. Our aim is to develop new low energy processes that maximize recovery of materials including metals and polymers from e-waste.
In this project, we are focusing on addressing the waste problem emerging from the roll out of renewable energy technologies. These include waste materials generated from solar energy and energy storage technologies. First targets in this project are solar PV panels and battery material wastes. A key activity in this project will be life cycle analysis to track the flow of materials in this sector and to estimate the environmental and other impacts these emerging wastes will have.

Over 80 representatives from Chinese and Australian universities, research institutes and leading companies in waste industry got together at the Centre in China to discuss cooperation, engagement, upgrade and innovation.The Dorsett Shanghai is a hotel near Longyang Road Maglev Train Station, making the hotel an excellent spot for whatever takes you to Shanghai, be it business or pleasure.

The Context
Today, Rwanda finds itself at a crossroads, moving from the humanitarian assistance phase associated with the 1994 genocide into one of sustainable development. Since 1994, the Government of Rwanda has stabilized the political situation, while putting the economy back on track with considerable assistance from development partners. Economic growth, alone, is not sufficient to bring about the necessary rise in standard of living of the population. To vanquish hunger and poverty, growth must be Pro-Poor, giving all Rwandan's the chance to gain from the new economic opportunities. Vision 2020 aspires for Rwanda to become a modern, strong and united nation, proud of its fundamental values, politically stable and without discrimination amongst its citizens.

Enterprise PDM does a fantastic job of doing this for us by automating the revisions through the workflows that we have set up. We release files for physical production, and when changes need to be made, we send them to a different state, make the changes and re-release them. Viola, new revision! However, what happens when we need to modify something simple on a released file? Say… a typo or new dimension? We don’t really want to create a new revision for the part or assembly just for a minor change as that would add a lot more confusion and take up more virtual real-estate than necessary. Enter the minor revision workflow loop!
The minor revision workflow loop is a great way for certified users to pull a file out of the released or production state to make those little changes that don’t actually affect the form, fit or function of the part. Also, it can be added to your workflow at any point in time without affecting your existing states and transitions. Below is an image of a standard CAD Workflow complete with a standard revision loop:
Although this is perfect for most circumstances, if a file is released, the only two ways to make a minor change is to A) Send it through the “Request change” transition and create a new revision of that file, or B) Give a user the permission to check out the file while it is in the “Released” state. Option A isn’t a very efficient solution and option B is quite obviously dangerous! So the best way for us to tackle this situation is to create another loop coming from the “Released” state. Below is an image of my workflow, now complete with the minor revision loop:
Now we have two options when a change is required on a file that has already been released; “Request change” and “Make a Minor Drawing Change”. Obviously the wording of the transitions may be a little different, but the effect is still the same. With this loop, we can move files to the new “Minor Change in Progress” where the users have permission to check the files out, then release them back into production. The main difference being in the transition going back to the “Released” state. When a file goes through the “Request change” loop, as it comes back around and get’s re-released through the “Change Approved” transition, the internal revision and “Revision” variable are updated with the new revision number or letter. However, when a file goes through the “Make a Minor Drawing Change” loop, as it is re-released through the “Minor Changes Complete” transition, those actions to not occur. See the difference between the two transition actions in the images below:
So there we have it. One loop to make a true revision change, and another simply to correct some minor mistakes. Notice how both transitions still contain the “Create PDF” action? That will ensure that no matter how you change a drawing, a new PDF will always be created once it has been re-released. For a little added security, you can also set up some conditions to only allow SOLIDWORKS drawing files through, or authentication to force users to enter their passwords before the transition, just to make them think a little!

Derek Lawson – PLM Consultant
Do you recommend auto incrementing of revision letters on parts or drawings or both?
How do you address the the files revision and file version being out of sync? If you put the loop in that you suggest, and change a released file without incrementing the revision the rev/version will be out of sync and the “Local version” attribute will read as “No Revision”.
Do you have a method of automatically syncing these 2 values together after the change?
Thanks
Brent Hannah
Alan,
In most scenarios we would recommend that both the model and the assembly be updated to maintain consistency and control. However, that may not be the case with all manufacturers. There are some companies who may not choose to revise the actual models, only the drawings, which is understandable as the geometry is only a reference for the drawing to use. The drawing is the actual product being sent to the manufacturers. With that being said, it can really be done either way. It simply depends on your design process.
Brent,
Thank you for the feedback and the excellent question! That is actually a common issue that tends to add confusion to the process. To answer this properly, we must look at a few other aspects of how things are going to be controlled and why they actually matter.
The first matter to discuss is obviously why we even need to keep those in sync. Enterprise PDM classifies files in two categories: Released Versions and Working Versions. You may notice the permission “Show working versions of files” under a groups folder permissions. Any file that does not have a revision assigned to it is considered a Working Version and may not be able to be seen by certain groups if that permission is not set. The only way to set a revision is to increment it manually or have it incremented during the transition, and we’ll want to do exactly that. When the file is sent back to the released state the revision does in fact need to be incremented again… but by 0.
The second matter to discuss is how we increment the revision the revisions. The transition must have an action set up like the others so that the files that are passing through it to have their revisions incremented, thus making them Released Versions that everyone can see. However, the amount in which we increment it can be set in two different places: The transition OR the state that the file is going to. In most cases this is set in the state and that means that all transitions going to that state will have their revisions incremented by whatever number has been set, usually it is “1”. Since we now have a transition going into that state that we DO NOT want to increment by 1, we will need to change how that value is defined.
So to answer your question, you may need to modify a little more of your workflow. First, open the “Released” state (or whatever you may have called it) and go to the “Revision Number” and ensure that the “Increment by” value is set to “0” or nothing. You will then have to go into the other transitions going into this state, click on their “Revision Numbers” tab and make sure that the value is set to “1”. Finally, open the “Minor Change Complete” transition, click on the “Revision Numbers” tab and ensure that the “Increment by” value is “0” or nothing. Then add a new action to that transition to Increment the Revision, but since the “Increment by” value is set to “0”, the revision will stay where it is at.
Essentially what we are now doing is telling all of the transitions that are going into the “Released” state to assign a revision to the files passing through, but we are controlling which revision it should be going to based on the number it is set to increment by in the transition itself.
I hope this helps!This is a true story – MotoGP winner and potential MotoGP champion, Maverick Vinales, will be coming to South Africa.
Yamaha South Africa made the announcement today that the Spaniard will be here in December to attend a special track day at Kyalami open to the first 40 people to buy a new Yamaha R1 or Yamaha R6 before the 20th of November.
Vinales bagan his Grand Prix career in 2011, racing an Aprilia in the then 125cc class. In 2013, he was crowned Moto3 world champion, earning him a spot in the Moto2 class. He had a hugely successful rookie season, winning in just the third round and going on to finish a commendable third in the championship. This earned him a place in the newly-formed Suzuki factory MotoGP team, in which he was crowned rookie of the year in 2015.
For 2017, Vinales made the move from Suzuki to the Movistar Yamaha Team partnering nine times world champion Valentino Rossi, and so far it has paid off. He was fastest through all of the pre-season testing, has won three of the first five races and so far leads the world title.
Also for 2017, Yamaha has released a new R6. This new model has a new fairing that is said to decrease wind resistance by 8%. It also features frame updates, a new rear shock, ABS, riding modes and traction control, making it the first supersport model to feature these electronic add-ons. It will be unveiled, together with the MT-10 SP, for the first time in South Africa at the SA Bike Festival taking place at the Kyalami Grand Prix Circuit.

Leak just to heat water, not leak it everywhere. But leaks like these, where they are a pain, are relatively easy to fix. They are easy to fix because they are easy to find. When you know the source of your leak, it makes it that much easier to make it go away. However, some leaks go undetected, and those can lead to some real damage.
Undetected leaks can lead to some serious problems because you may not even realize you have a problem to begin with.
Your first tip may be that your water bill is a little higher than you thought it would be. But as you search your house for possible problems, these insidious leaks are the hardest ones to find. For a homeowner, it may be impossible to see the leak because it could be in an area that you have no access to like a slab leak. This is a leak that is under the foundation of your house and without the proper equipment you would never be able to find it.
This is where we can help. Not only are we equipped to help you find the leak we can do it in a noninvasive way. Instead of ripping up your property and searching for the possible source of the leak we can use technology to find the leak without wrecking your yard. This method saves time and money as we can address the leak right away and not cause additional damage through the search that would need to be fixed after the leak was found. Talk to NIR Plumbing today if you suspect you have a leak but are sure of its origins.I just posted the comment below to the Institute of Medicine (IOM), recommending that they include people with knowledge of integrative medicine on their panel that will be comparing the effectiveness of medical treatments. Click here to leave your own suggestions/comments about the composition of the proposed panel. (Comments will be accepted until March 23, 2009.) At the end of this posting, I'll give links to other websites with relevant information about this issue.
I urge you to access the above link and offer your own input to the IOM about this very important issue.
TO: The Institute of Medicine
I would like to thank the Institute of Medicine (IOM) for giving me this opportunity to submit my comments and recommendations concerning this panel, which has been slated to make recommendations for the $1.1 billion earmarked for comparative effectiveness research of medical treatments.
In my opinion, it is important to have the right people in on the job from the very beginning, so that the a full range of treatments will be compared, once the real comparative effectiveness research begins.
When I looked at the names on your site of the selected panelists, I could not help but notice that TWO very important groups are not being represented:
1) As has been pointed out by the Center for Science in the Public Interest, there are NO TRUE PATIENT OR CONSUMER REPRESENTATIVES on the panel. In their words, “the only patient or consumer representative named to the panel’s tentative roster was from the Alzheimer’s Association, a single-issue patient advocacy group that RECEIVES SUBSTANTIAL SUPPORT FROM THE DRUG INDUSTRY.” (A coalition of 20 consumer, public health and patient advocacy groups has written to the Institute of Medicine, asking that at least three consumer representatives be added to the panel.)
2) Also, and of equal importance: There are NO MEMBERS ON THE PANEL WHO ARE EITHER CAM PRACTITIONERS, OR CAM ADVOCATES. (By the acronym CAM, I am referring to complementary/holistic/”alternative”/integrative practitioners and patient advocates.)
I was amazed at (and extremely surprised and troubled by) both omissions. But I find the SECOND omission especially puzzling, since in late February, two extremely exciting events took place:
(a) First, the IOM convened a 3-day Summit on Integrative Medicine and the Health of the Public, which was attended by hundreds of people from across the country, excited at the prospect that the new healthcare system would include CAM treatments. The consensus was that the effective use of CAM treatments would save our healthcare system HUGE amounts of money. (Here is a description of this Summit, which integrative healthcare activist and Huffington Post blogger, Alison Rose Levy, called “groundbreaking.” You may also listen to audios of all the speakers’ presentations.)
(b) During the same week, Senate hearings were convened, with several integrative healthcare luminaries testifying. For a video of the complete hearing, go here.
I would like to suggest that speakers at this hearing, including Drs. Andrew Weil, Mehmet Oz, Mark Hyman and Dean Ornish (as well as several of the Summit speakers and attendees), would be excellent additions to this IOM panel.

No matter what bird - turkey, duck, chicken, quail- - is on the table, it is likely to be accompanied by deer, squirrel, raccoon, frog legs, crawfish or anything else one of the family shot or caught on or near their Louisiana acreage. Homegrown tomatoes, cabbage, potatoes, corn and berries probably will be on the menu as well.
Those who know the Duck Commander's story (told in his book, "Happy, Happy, Happy" with Mark Schlabach) are aware that, in his early life, even the bare necessities were scarce and self-reliance was a requirement. Phil and two of his four sons also had to overcome drug and alcohol problems associated with "honky-tonk life."
Yet their circumstances likely were not as harsh as the conditions faced by the Pilgrims in a strange land. They faced a winter of cruel weather following a difficult four-month crossing of the Atlantic Ocean during which the 102 passengers - including 34 children - squeezed aboard the "Mayflower" lost four of their number. An additional 17 of the Massachusetts colonists died within the first three months of their late November landing and supplies were scarce.
Spurred on by their desire for religious freedom, the newcomers struggled to build houses, plant crops and explore the territory, despite continuing hardships. But there was no activity on Sundays, scrupulously observed as days of worship and rest. These were the men who had signed the Mayflower Compact declaring that what they were undertaking was "for the glory of God and advancement of the Christian faith" (seldom mentioned in schools that seem adverse to any hint of religion anymore, in Phil's view).
Things began to change for members of the redneck Robertson clan as they built a hand-crafted duck caller business into a multimillion dollar conglomerate for which they declare their thankfulness. Hidden by the bib overalls or hunters' camouflage garb of the bearded men is the fact that several of those in the Duck Dynasty have advanced degrees. (Phil, a former teacher, has a master's degree in education.)
The biggest change came when at age 28, Phil, followed by the boys, came to know "Jesus Christ, son of the Almighty God, who washed away my sins, taught me a better way to live, and guaranteed my eternal inheritance." (Some of the women were way ahead of them.)
For their part, the Pilgrims were thankful for the seemingly miraculous appearance of Samoset, an Indian chief from Maine, and Squanto, a Patuxent brave. Both spoke some English, possibly picked up as slaves taken to Spain and England. The pair guided the planting of a bumper crop of vegetables and introduced the Pilgrims to the local Indian chief, Massasoit, who showed them where and how to hunt the animals of the area.
So with 90 Indians as their guests, the Pilgrims, not as straight-laced as often portrayed, partied for three or four days, eating heartily, drinking ale, dancing and playing games - one akin to cricket or stick ball. Of course, there was worship featuring prayers of thanksgiving.
Viewers of the Dynasty reality show on TV know the Robertsons like to party. Most are athletic and into sports. Phil was the starting quarterback on the Louisiana Tech football team when former Pittsburgh Steelers Hall-of-Famer Terry Bradshaw was his backup.
They also know not just a holiday banquet but daily family dinners begin with prayers of thanksgiving (over the objection of producers) as a regular feature of the series. All the Robertsons are avid Bible students. Three are ordained preachers, one a pastor.
According to his book, Phil believes not just the way they celebrate Thanksgiving but the faith shared by his family is akin to that of the early settlers and founding fathers.
"I'm right there with our founding fathers," he writes. "I'm a patriot and a Christian, and I'm moving forth with what they started...I may be the only man reading and quoting Scripture, carrying his Bible and blowing duck calls to crowds, but, hey, it has to start somewhere. It's what makes me happy, happy, happy."

This 4 bedroom 3.5 bath contemporary design -- so handsomely photographed by Bob Greenspan -- shows how to maximize airiness and luxury amenities within an efficient three-level plan. From the foyer with its closet and adjacent powder room you pass the kitchen island and enter the soaring great room where window walls open to a generous rear deck. You feel you are in a spacious treehouse! The major bedrooms are upstairs, and include an office/guest room (with its own bath) situated near the master suite -- so it can be used as a "snoritorium" in a pinch! The fourth bedroom -- which could be a teen suite -- a media room, and laundry are on the bottom level opening to a covered patio. An elevator to all three levels makes this the perfect choice for aging in place."

Did you see the childish protesters (Senators included) who were disrupting the Kavanaugh hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee? You probably had the same reaction the rest of us did- someone shut those yahoos up.
Well, when a protester tried to disrupt a hearing on the House side of Capitol Hill, Rep. Billy Long (R-MO) did just that. And the first thing I thought was, 'of course he's from Missou-ah." Why? Well, Montana's former US Senator, farm broadcaster, and cattle auctioneer Conrad Burns also grew up in Missouri. (By the way, an old Burns staffer tells me that Conrad Burns actually babysat Billy Long when he was a kid! She says she heard it from the congressman himself. I am working to confirm) *Update: Rep. Long actually called in to Montana Talks on Thursday morning. While Conrad didn't babysit him, he does have a great story about Conrad Burns doing some babysitting. Audio will be posted soon*One of my most favorite quotes I’ve ever heard was born out of everything that should not make sense, but until you live out the power of words, they will just fall on ears not ready to hear. Live them, and the words suddenly define your life, and add another line to your story.
“It is doubtful that God can bless (use) a man greatly until until He has hurt him deeply.” A.W. Tozer
No one ever sets out to be hurt. Most of my life, I flew so far under the radar that I evaded hurt just by keeping entirely to myself. You’ll find if you stay out of everyone’s way, do what you’re supposed to do, you’ll generally avoid too much trouble. Be invisible and you don’t get in the way of anyone. No one can stay invisible forever, though, and really…we wouldn’t want to stay that way.
These days, on the whole, it seems near to impossible to avoid hurt in a sea of opinions. We’ve become people more known for what we are against than what we are for. Make yourself visible in any way, be it standing out for a worthy job performance, confident in any way, how you dress, posting your opinion, and on and on…well, you’re probably going to be the object of criticism. We’re in a world looking for the wrong, bent on disrespect, and we (me, myself and I) are the smartest people we know. I remember hearing the saying growing up, “We can’t win for losing.” No truer words could capture what it’s like to just try and live these days.
Ever feel like you are living a “headed for failure” life? Can’t do anything right, every turn is a dead end, and your neighbor seems to be headed everywhere BUT the wrong way? I can easily feel that way when my eyes focus on what everyone else “thinks” I ought to be doing. Whether said or unsaid, expectations of others rarely land us in the “winner” lane. In a dog eat dog culture, expectations do not often take on the appearance of others dreaming big dreams for us. Expectations often take on a negative spin, believing the absolute worst in people, rather than the best.
When the expectations others put upon us are greater than the ones they put on themselves, there are no winners.
Having great expectations for ourselves is a great thing. It’s sets a goal before us for which we can aim. We can even set healthy expectations for others, and do so when we parent children, set a tone for school and the workplace, and even as a church. Expectation leads to anticipation of what’s to come. When in the context of the goal being to move forward, expectation is a pretty awesome thing! When expectations are unhealthy, the impossible is demanded out of people that are not perfect, mind-reading skills are required, and the focus on what others aren’t doing is more important than looking in the mirror to realize what we are not doing. Suddenly our environment is defined by things like “You don’t do this right,” or “You walked right past me and didn’t speak,” and a “Your sin is greater than mine” mentality. We would never admit that the last part of that sentence is something we would actually say, but our actions would definitely show that we expect people are so much worse than we are that, of course, their sin is, too. See why we can’t win for losing? Winning will only happen when we shift the expectations we have squarely back on ourselves. Expect as much out of ourselves as we do anyone else, there will be no time to focus on what others should be doing that they are not. Expect as much out of ourselves with a heart and life living for an audience of One, we’ll live lives that expect what He expects, and that is never the worst of anyone or anything. He is for me. He is for you. His only expectation is that we live holy lives, worthy of the calling He has placed on us – to become what He’s created us to be.
Expectations that find their beginning in love will result in lives that can’t lose for winning!
Do you find yourself believing the absolute worst of people? I have, if I’m honest. When trust in others is at stake it’s oddly easier to believe the worst because the hurt may be less. It sets a low bar with low expectation. How much life are we sucking out of those around us when we expect the very worst of them because we’ve bought into the lie that they probably believe the worst of us? It’s a vicious cycle that only ends when someone decides to be a cycle breaker! Is it worth it to stop and think that maybe no one is out to get you at all, that expectations don’t have to take on the appearance of their synonym “assumption”? That’s right. Look it up. Expectation will assume! I’ve written more blogs and articles about the harm of assumption than probably anything because I daily witness the damage it always does. I’ve done it and I’ve been a victim of it, and either way I’ve not one time felt good about myself in any way!
Today, can we expect the best and see where that takes us? Can we make amends with those we’ve unfairly controlled with our lofty expectations? Let’s plant our expectations in a soil that produces fruit and not weeds. Be for your life reflecting His glory. Be a life that is FOR His glory to shine on another. Why would you want to expect anything less?About this artwork.

Dear Neighbors Who Have Been Setting Off Fireworks for the Last Week:
Yes, this is to you. You who have been setting off fireworks since about June 27th until 11 or 12 at night.
I’m trying to believe you aren’t as selfish as you are making yourself appear, and I’m trying to believe that you’re just ignorant. So, I thought I’d enlighten you.
Some of us have young children, and the LOUD BANGING NOISE of the exploding fireworks coming every 45 seconds or so KEEPS THEM AWAKE AT NIGHT.
Some of us have special needs children who have sensory issues and who end up on their knees on their beds, shielding their heads and rocking back and forth whimpering against the repeated noise that just WON’T STOP FOR HOURS.
Some of us have husbands who actually have to go to work the next morning, but instead, are up until MIDNIGHT with over-stimulated children WHO CAN’T SLEEP.
Some of us have children who have some pretty serious sleep issues, and even if they ARE KEPT UP UNTIL MIDNIGHT, will still wake up at 6AM. And, if they fall asleep for even 5 minutes during the day, they cannot fall asleep at night, which creates a cycle if insomnia that is hard to break. So, they spend their day, AFTER BEING KEPT UP UNTIL MIDNIGHT BY YOU in a state of exhaustion that has no relief.
All of you who are my neighbors live in a town where it is ILLEGAL to set off the kind of fireworks you’re setting off. Which means, when I call the police and tell them that you’re setting off the fireworks ILLEGALLY, they actually will go put a stop to it.
Because, the bigger thing is that it’s THE 4TH OF JULY. Not the 27th of June, not the 1st of July, not the 6th of July? It’s INDEPENDENCE DAY. Do you open your presents for Christmas on the 22nd of December?
So, you can now consider yourself no longer ignorant on the matter. And while I’m as patriotic as any American out there, and will be lighting sparklers and setting off firecrackers with my sons on the 4th of July, I will NOT be lighting fireworks until midnight on the 2nd. Because I’m not ignorant nor inconsiderate. I’m just tired.
Signed,
Your Neighbor
>, for a moment there I thought you lived in Marion In. I must live near the relatives of your neighbors!! I’m sorry for your pain and do I ever understand. I could really get on a soapbox but you’ve done such a great job explaining why early fireworks are no ok that I”ll just let it go with a “hum, I’m not the only mom who deals with this!”
Praying for peace for you on the 5th!
Tammy
Oh gosh, can I relate, and I live in Canada! Our 4th of July is actually July 1, but the fireworks have been going since June 27, and they still haven’t stopped! And frankly, at this point, it’s not only the kids being kept up by the fireworks, but me as well. My kids get me up all night without fireworks, so I like to go to bed early, and it’s me being kept awake by the darned things, too. *sigh* So.Tired…
Oh my honey. PREACH IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I totally get it! What’s the DEAL!? And if Annie has a 5 minute nap in the car, her night is shot with sleep too. What’s that about anyway?
I hate fireworks.
They went off until 1:45AM the night of July 4th. It was awful. Glad it’s over until New Year’s.
I retract “glad it’s over.” Still going off – at 10:52 on the 5th. Called the police, they’re allowed to do it until tomorrow. *sigh*Type Basic B: 10m², hikers cabin. Max 2~3 pers

It's hot in the city and the Liverpool Empire Youth Theatre is set to turn up the heat further with their latest production, In The Heights. We caught up with Natalie Flynn, Director and Creative Learning Manager and cast members to find out more.
What made you choose In The Heights as your next production?
Natalie Flynn (NF): We wanted to pick a show that would challenge our Youth Theatre Company, creative team and audiences. It was important to pick a show that had themes that our cast and audience could relate to. The show has a timeless message that is told through a fantastic musical score that includes elements of Hip Hop, Rap, Latin American and traditional Broadway. The characters within the show are on the brink of change, they are full of hopes, dreams and pressures which is a universal theme that all of us can relate to.
How big is the cast and how old are they?
NF: Our 45 cast members are aged 15 - 21.
What do you think you can learn from musical theatre as opposed to a stage play?
NF: There are so many things to learn from all forms of live theatre/performance regardless of whether it is a play, musical, opera or ballet. Live Theatre offers us as performers and audience a shared experience. An experience that provides a mirror to society, it provides an opportunity to partake in one of the most basic human instincts which is storytelling. These stories and characters enable us to connect to people, places and ideas that we might otherwise not be exposed to.
What attracts you to musical theatre as a genre?
NF: Music and dance are emotive and a powerful forms of expression which pull on all our emotions. The music in the show gives insight to the characters, it provides entertainment and moves the story along quickly whilst still contributing to the tone and style. The musical provides a source of escapism and magic that can transport its audiences. The dialogue between characters is heightened allowing all manner of things to be said and expressed that would otherwise not be conveyed.
Do you have to be able to sing and dance to be part of the Youth Theatre?
NF: We hold annual auditions to be part of the Youth Theatre and from the auditions, we select a company that will work with us for the academic year. Participants do not have to be trained singers or dancers. Some join our company having never previously performed and others will have had lots of previous experience or training from one of the many fantastic dance/drama schools within the local area. All members are passionate about performing and have to be very committed to working hard. More importantly they have to be good team members.
How many performances of In The Heights will there be?
NF: Three. Two evening performances at 7.30pm and a Saturday matinee at 2.30pm.
What is the most important thing to consider when putting on a piece of musical theatre?
NF: You have to be true to the story and true to the characters. The performers have to convey the story through the elements of acting, singing and dancing in equal measure. Time has to be given during the rehearsal period to not only perfecting the choreography and songs but also to allow the actors to explore the themes and motivations of the characters they are playing. Physical and vocal health is also very important - its hard work performing in a musical!
The show is set in a Latino suburb of New York, how do you bring such a different culture to life on stage in Liverpool?
NF: With its history as a port city Liverpool has a diverse population from around the world and so this show is perfect for telling that story. This is a story of family, home, love and pride and knowledge of heritage. The characters represent three distinct generations within that community that can be seen throughout the world. The generation who moved away from everything they know to start over in a new country, the generation that has roots in both their new country and the old, and finally the generation that has lived in the country their whole lives and the enormous pressure they face to rise even further above what the previous generations have achieved.
Why did you want to be involved with the production In The Heights?
Jamil: I have been part of the Empire's youth projects for nearly 6 years including ballet and musical theatre. When the show was announced to be In The Heights I saw the opportunity to further get involved as the show is more contemporary and would set new challenges for me.
Jaheim: I like acting and I wanted to try for the main part.
Ellie: I wanted to be involved with In The Heights as it is my favourite musical and from previous shows with Liverpool Empire Youth Theatre, I knew it would be fantastic!
Beth: I have done many previous shows with the Empire Youth Theatre and I love the whole process. I meet so many amazing performers and creatives and we all work together to create an amazing piece of theatre. I also love In The Heights, it is one of my favourite shows, so I had to audition.
Why do you think In The Heights appeals to modern audiences?
Jamil: In The Heights uses more modern styles of music such as hip hop and rap which allows younger and more modern audiences to relate to the characters and story more.
Jaheim: It's true to life. Due to the reactions towards people from ethnic backgrounds in the show and how it's the same in everyday life in some places.
Ellie: I think In The Heights appeals to modern audiences as it is about everyday struggles that people can relate to. It's about overcoming these issues and uniting together as a community and making bonds stronger with family and friends, ensuring positivity.
Beth: I think it appeals to modern audiences because of the music, it is so current and diverse that people don't expect musical theatre to incorporate some of these styles. It is very intriguing!
What learnings do you think you can take away from musical theatre as opposed to a stage play?
Jamil: Stage play actors can use speech to convey a character's story but a musical theatre performer can also exploit the medium of song to further express the emotions and story of a character which I personally think can be appreciated more.
Jaheim: To always be confident and to always try my best and be myself.
Ellie: Stage plays are often quite naturalistic whereas musical theatre gives you the confidence to show all aspects of talent within you from singing to dancing as well as acting.
Beth: I have learnt how to incorporate all 3 disciples into one, to communicate a story to an audience. We can express ourselves through music and dance without speaking a word.
What do you think is the most exciting part of putting together a show like In The Heights?
Jamil: I think the concept of togetherness within the show makes it really fun for everyone to get involved in and have their own individual personal narratives within the set story.
Jaheim: The time when it's all finished and it looks amazing
Ellie: I think the most exciting part of putting this show together is the unity that it brings to make the show as powerful as it can be. Everyone in this show has the same importance, from the ensemble members to the principals, which helps us all to bond really well together for a positive outcome.
Beth: A great part is meeting new people- cast and creative team and working with them. Also learning new material- songs, dances and exploring another person's world and communicating one story through this.
What attracts you to musical theatre as a genre?
Jamil: The range of characters and styles within the genre attracts me because it always brings new challenges for you to take on and improve your skills.
Jaheim: I love comedy and I love shows that involve all types of races/ethnicities.
Ellie: The thing that attracts me to musical theatre is the 'wow factor' and passion it holds. When listening to the harmonies and seeing the company dance and act together it brings an unexplainable feeling of joy and happiness.
Beth: What attracted me was incorporating all three disciplines and the joy of doing three things I love and performing this for an audience.
How are you able to sing and dance at the same time (are there any techniques to use?)
Jamil: You need to work on your cardio ability and then it's mainly about breath control and not sounding too out of breath.
Jaheim: Always focus and keep calm.
Ellie: For singing and dancing, I think the most important thing is your breathing and knowing when to breathe and how deep to breathe. You should experiment with how much power you put into your dancing and perhaps slightly tone it down allowing you to perform to the best of your ability with both singing and dancing.
Beth: I have to say singing and dancing at the same time is very tricky, but I feel it is all about practice! The more you practice the better you become (build up your stamina). I don't really have a specific technique, I think it is just knowing your own body, you can find places to breathe and places to adjust and try not to hold tension.
The show features a broad range of music and dance styles. Which was your favourite?
Jamil: I think the commercial hip-hop style are my favourite because it is a change from what I'm used to.
Jaheim: Both due to the how powerful they are together.
Ellie: My favourite number in the show is Blackout where there is a power cut in the neighbourhood and the full company come together to unite. I love this, not only because of the warming harmonies but because of the story behind each character's emotions.
Beth: Definitely the rap! I don't rap in the musical, but I love it! It is so captivating. I also love all the Latin dance - I think it is great fun, challenging and interactive.
In The Heights runs at the Liverpool Empire Theatre from 24 to 25 August 2018.

"I shot the turkey but I did not shoot the deputy!" this guy is handing a murdered bird over to a couple in order to help the celebrate the american Thanksgiving holiday. I suppose this is back in the day when you would take a fresh one home and then pluck it yourself.
View AllIt is June. One year and three months since I began infertility treatments. Such a long time and still no baby. I am sad. No, I am beyond sad–I am enraged, frustrated, full of yearning.
I am tired of yearning.
I long to hold hands with a baby…a baby that is mine.
I look at mothers in supermarkets, mothers who look angry, tired and annoyed at their rambunctious little brats and I think: God, why can’t that be me? Why can’t I be pushing around a cart full of loud, overtired, rambunctious children?
These mothers look so overworked, and yet they have no idea that I would do anything to have what they have.
These women look deceivingly ordinary in so many ways, and I think: why can’t I have their ordinary life–the one that includes a grocery cart full of babies?
There is a woman I see occasionally who has four young children. She is beautiful and her children are lovely too.
When I saw her holding hands with one of her young sons the other day, I was struck with that image–the image of a woman holding hands with her son.
Hands to hold. I want little hands to hold.
When I see the little hands of a baby, I think: what in the world must it
feel like to hold the little hands of a baby that you gave birth to? What I would give to hold such little hands, to know those hands were mine to hold, to know that those were the hands of my daughter or my son?
I am going to write Dr. P a letter to ask that he do a lapascropy to see if I have a problem with endometriosis. I hope he listens and does what I want. I have to word the letter in a way that will get him to do as I ask.
I need little hands to hold. Hands that are all mine. To all the women I see shopping in supermarkets, who see themselves as ordinary mothers, I say–you have everything I want and there is nothing ordinary about your role as the mother to those little humans who are driving you crazy.
Please God, give me a little human to tire me out. Please let me be an ordinary mother in a supermarket one day.
I can’t imagine anything in this world more special or more fun than pushing around my babies at the supermarket. My happy-ever-after is so plain and ordinary, boring even, and yet it feels so hopelessly impossible and faraway.The MindBullet GOTY Awards 2018
2018 was actually a pretty good year for me on a personal level. Mainly, I switched careers and started making enough money to live comfortably on my own while also having room for indulging in gaming more often. While I still don't feel like I have a huge amount of time to sit down and play, looking back on the year I did manage to get a decent amount of playtime in across a bunch of different titles.
So, here are some games I played!'Does one of them need to grab a jacket?' Daria Gavrilova's Amber Sherlock moment at the Australian Open when she walks out on court in the EXACT same thing as her rival

Australia's Daria Gavrilova experienced a 'Julie Snook' moment in her third round match against Timea Bacsinszky at the Australian Open on Saturday night.

The pair wore matching navy tank tops and sky blue skirts, with matching pink and black Asics trainers.

The talk here is about IDEA Cellular’s new ad campaign which goes on air, today. After a successful series of What an Idea, Sirji! campaigns with Brand Ambassador, Abhishek Bachchan, the leading mobile brand will now be seen promoting the idea of mobile VAS usage for vast number of day to day activities, to save paper. Brand Ambassador Abhishek Bachchan, playing the role of an agonized ‘Tree’ this time, strikes the idea of using mobile phone to save paper, and therefore, the greenery around him. As more and more people switch to their mobile screens, from everyday usage of paper, the tree regains life and leaves the audience with a simple message – ‘Use Mobile, Save Paper’. The pan-India mobile brand will launch a nation-wide awareness campaign to spread this message.
IDEA’s new campaign will be extensively seen across TV, Print, Digital and Outdoor media space during the next few months. IDEA plans to launch a range of Value Added Services which will help customers access more information and utility services on their mobile phones, thus reducing dependency on paper usage.Description

People set up trusts for different reasons. They, like good financial solutions, have unique properties, which can help you meet your goals. However, if not set up properly however, they can be a hindrance to your plans and ultimately a disaster.
Before setting up a trust, answer three important questions with the help of a qualified financial planner, says Floris Slabbert, Country Manager at Ecsponent Financial Services:
- What is the purpose of the trust?
- What assets do you want to incorporate and how will you do it?
- What is more appropriate – a living (inter-vivos) trust or a testamentary trust. If it is a “legacy-planning” situation, a testamentary trust (established after death) may be more appropriate than a living trust?
Slabbert explains the intricacies involved when working through the third question: “Legacy planning is where a person prepares a financial strategy, usually with the help of a financial advisor, to bequeath his or her assets to next of kin of a loved one after death.
“A living trust is a legal document created during a person’s lifetime. Just like a will, a living trust spells out exactly what your desires are with regard to your assets, your dependents, and your heirs. The big difference,” explains Slabbert, “is that a will becomes effective only after you die and your will has been submitted to the Master.”
He adds: “A testamentary trust is established through the provisions of a last will and testament. These provisions stipulate the details about how a person’s assets must be divided and distributed. This often includes the proceeds from insurance policies in respect of the life of the deceased. One will may be more than one testamentary trust per will.”
Once it becomes clear that it is necessary to establish a trust, you need to consider a host of factors. These range from tax implications – both present and future – legislation, death and intricacies unique to the management of trusts. Make sure you understand the purpose of your trust and the responsibility of a trustee.
There is a misconception that trusts eliminate or at least reduce tax burdens. Beware that they can do the opposite and create additional tax liabilities if not structured properly. In this instance, the help of tax expert is invaluable. SARS will always try to maximise revenue. Hence, legislation can change unexpectedly to close so-called ‘tax-bleeding’ holes,” warns Slabbert.
There is a lot of red tape. “As a start, everyone involved must comply with FICA requirements. In the case of living trusts, trustees must conduct themselves in a way that shows they are responsible, involved and present at general meetings. Trusts are subject to increased scrutiny from tax practitioners and even beneficiaries do not hesitate to challenge a trust or trustee in court.”
Despite the legislation that prescribes the governance of trusts, many people, says Slabbert, misunderstand the financial implications of transferring ownership of an asset to a trust. The legislation is complicated and changed recently, putting trust-held assets at risk.
For example, legislation governing business property trusts was changed from 1 March 2017. Among other chances, it entails that a business trust can no longer accept interest-free loans. This makes it more expensive to buy property via these trusts as the minimum prescribed interest rate is now repo rate plus one percent.
Also take note of the lender’s death affects a trust. Without enough life cover to deal with the fees and taxes, the trust will have to recover those fees to pay the estate.
“Ideally, the trust should be the beneficiary of life cover on the donor(s) life,” advises Slabbert. “This puts the trust in a position where it can redeem the loan account. If the trust then does not deduct the life cover premiums over the course of the lender’s life, it will not pay taxes when the policy pays out. Yet, at the very end, your estate will end up donating the funds received from the trust, back to your trust, which then incurs estate duty above the normal abatement.”
A donation to a trust will immediately be taxed at 20% if it exceeds R100 000 per year and is payable within three months of the donation taking place. If the donor doesn’t pay the donation tax, the trust has to pay it within ninety days. If not done, SARS will charge interest to both parties.
A trust can bring burdens, but also save a lot of money, while operating within legal bounds, if one knows how! A business property trust, for example, can reduce expensive property transfer duties and bond registration costs when the company’s shareholding, under the trust, is sold to a buyer,” says Slabbert.
If the purpose of your trust is to make provision for your children, it would be more beneficial to have a trust “mortis causa”, after you pass away, he advises. “This allows for significant tax abatements, which are capped at R3.5 million — and double that between spouses. These abatements would be forfeited if you set up a trust now and donated your assets to the entity.
“In addition, living trusts limit your beneficiaries who have to act within the laws of the trust. They might find themselves in financial trouble, forcing them to sell off trust assets for livelihood. In such a case, a mortis causa would be more useful, as it dissolves after certain objectives are met or after a certain time.”
Ultimately, says Slabbert, a trust should only be created with the help of an expert, for the specific benefit of your beneficiaries. If not, a trust can become a tax and financial burden on everyone involved.3 Magic Bullets That Create Antique Style
Interior Design by Celerie Kemble
So what is the best furniture deal out there? It could be what you already own.
Arguably, the best value in furniture right now is good old-fashioned antiques, particularly “brown” furniture. Still, even if antiques are a great financial choice, or you already own some, no one wants their living room to look like grandma’s parlor. So how do you create “antique style?”
My recent travels during the January Winter Antiques Week in NYC (plus some mighty fine decorating by leading designers), suggests several tricks.
Here are 3 magic bullets that create antique style:
1. Add Color
Interior designer Miles Redd uses bold color to create antique style all the time.
Interior Design by Miles Redd
At the recent Winter Antiques Show in NYC, I saw what a jolt color gives to an array of antiques over and over again.
Imagine what this 1914 portrait by American artist, Robert Henri, would do for a room full of antique brown furniture.
Pop.
2. Add Pattern
We all loved this room by interior designer Mark Sikes at the 2015 Kips Bay Show House and it was filled to the rafters with brown furniture, wicker and other antique accessories. And pattern–which made all of the traditional antiques sing. Talk about antique style.
When interior designer Sara Story was asked to curate a mix of antiques on offer at Sotheby’s, she also made it all seem new again by employing bold pattern on the wall.
Others give antiques new life by pairing them with a vibrantly patterned fabric.
Both techniques are successful.
3. Bring Nature Home
Nature makes everything fresh, including antiques. Natural elements, both real and faux, are a sure way to add antique style. These tulips I spotted at the Winter Antiques Show are not even real (they are made of glass) but look what they do for this booth!
Even if you have a black thumb, you can revitalize a room filled with traditional forms by mixing in items that evoke the outdoors like Celerie Kemble did here.
Think ceramic stools, trellis or a beautiful floral mural wallpaper.
Are you ready to freshen up your old antiques for spring?

VivifyScrum, the company behind the eponymous Agile project management software made its proprietary Scrum training course available to everyone interested, completely for free. Over 15 comprehensive chapters and quizzes, VivifyScrum Edu provides more than a basic understanding of Scrum, the most popular Agile approach.
The increased adoption of Agile approaches such as Scrum to project management across industries has resulted in greater demand, but also in higher salaries. For example, the recently published Scrum Master Trends report by Scrum.org showed that two-thirds of Scrum Masters make more than $75,000 in yearly salary, with numbers being even higher in the United States and Australia.
Equally interesting is the data which shows that by far the largest number (over 70 percent) of organizations that are adopting Agile are still in the early or growing stages, meaning that there will only be more need for Scrum Masters and agile coaches in the future.
In light of this new data, VivifyScrum decided to help the community and the industry by providing access to their Scrum course completely free of charge.
The VivifyScrum Edu was designed and developed in its entirety by VivifyScrum team and a number of consulting certified Scrum Masters. The course was envisioned as both an introduction to the world of Scrum and a resource that would ask more advanced questions and inspire truly Agile thinking in people who do the course.
Goran Prijic, the CEO of VivifyScrum pointed this out as the crucial idea behind the course,
“We wanted to make sure the course is not just questions and (the right and wrong) answers. We wanted to create hypothetical situations where people can apply their new Scrum knowledge and really think about the best approach to different situations.”
About VivifyScrum
VivifyScrum is the company behind the Agile project management software of the same name. The tool is a top-to-bottom project management solution that covers everything from collaboration on Agile boards, time and team management and even invoicing.

Then Irma came.
Like many others, our house on Black Creek Drive was destroyed and our baby boy was born 1 week later. No pressure right?
Our garage, uninsured for flood, was flooded. A car, some Christmas decorations but more to the heart, all of the equipment we had purchased for the restaurant was destroyed. Grills, dishwashers, tea makers, shrimp deveiners and the list goes on...all gone along with most of our money used to pay for our dream.
We got angry, we cried, we stood in awe at all the wonderful people who helped and hugged us. We welcomed our beautiful baby boy into the world and truly understood the meaning of "blessed".
We thought about selling and moving but that wasn't right. We go to school here, work here, live here and raise our family here. Middleburg is our home.
We re-imagined it all. Figured out how to cook with less equipment and seat fewer people and thanks to family and friends, were able to have the money to open and keep moving towards our dream.

Anal Cherry
Anal Cherry
By: Sassy Sue 1617
Edited: obsessivelesbian
I would have never thought it would be possible to be on a euphoric high days after an exquisite cybersex session with a creative, gorgeous, sexy woman. I am still replaying our cyber lovemaking in my head. Some consider this crazy or bizarre behavior. I call it admiration, to be able to influence another sensual being think about their decisions and the direction to take when deciding a path to travel is a gift. I just want to thank this delicious woman for the fantastic session. I hope I left her with a good memory as well.
This superb woman provided me with so much pleasure and clarity; I now know what I am going to do and surrender my anal cherry. I will always think of my cyber lover as my first anal lover. You never forget the person who took your cherry. To me, it is on the taking of your anal cherry is the same magnitude as losing your virginity.
I started the day by waking to wonderful feeling in my body. The sun was warm and bright and set in a field of azure blue. I was glowing and experiencing a feeling of contentment in the afterglow of great sex. Today was going to be spent with my cyber lover running around in my head. I started the day with some phone calls.
The first call was to my favorite spa and I scheduled an appointment for the full spa treatment. Next call was to my girlfriend Jessie, who was going to do the deed on Saturday night.
My body was charged with sexual energy. Every thought or feeling was connected to my intriguing, delicious cyber lover and our super sensual sexual interlude. I offered her the gift of my virtual anal cherry and she eagerly took my offering. She had prepared me to surrender my anal cherry.
Entering the bathroom, I turned on the shower and let my ruby red cami fall to the floor. I looked at my body in the mirror and brushed my breasts until the nipples went rigid; the shower was hot and I entered the steaming chamber. Quickly I lathered my body with soap, caressed the "girls" and gave each nipple a quick kiss. Then, I stimulated my anxious slit until my VJ got damp with love juice.
I exited the shower, patted myself dry, and applied a dusting of Shimmer Powder. Hence, I was ready to get dressed. With all the things I planned to do that day I required a minimal amount of clothing.
I inserted my Ben-Wa balls into Lucy, my pussy, to give my kegel muscles a work out and then I selected a sheer silver colored C-String thong to cover the gateway to my pleasure center. I was going braless today so the "girls" could enjoy the day, be free and relish the motion of the fabric against would glide across "their" nipples. Finally, I put on a short black perforated sleeveless dress with a sheer silver lining and a deep V-Neck with a silver zipper closure on the front. Like all form-fitting dresses, it felt sexy with a pair of black ankle boots that I could slip on and take off easily.
I left the apartment headed for my favorite deli for some OJ and a fruit cup and then to the el. I ate my breakfast during the short commute. I radiated sexual energy and saw many steal a personally wistful glance. Well, I did not have time to tease today.
I entered the Spa; the receptionist gave me a quick look over, smiled, and greeted me. She directed me to a waxing room. When I entered, I was greeted again, and it was Jean whom I was acquainted with for years.
She whistled, "You are hot to trot." She said teasing me meaningfully.
She had me disrobed. I licked my lips when she exposed and lay me on the table face up. Then she offered me a towel to cover my breasts; I declined, as I wanted to be naked as long as possible and had to keep my sexual energy souring with freedom.
I informed Jean that I wanted a leg wax and a Brazilian Wax but save my "V" landing strip and trim it. Jean, the consummate professional, started her undertaking. First, she inspected my areolas to insure that Thelma and Louise were hair free. Then she moved to my toes and quickly removed the miniscule hair that resided on them. Finally, she started to apply the hot wax strips to my legs.
I closed my eyes and went to bliss. I was thinking about the fantastic cyber-sex session, when my cyber lover took my anal cherry. I forgot all about what Jean was doing with the wax strips. I recalled dreamily of assuming the doggy position, with my head on a pillow, my ass high in the air, and my lover behind me. Her smooth hands tickled my skin and she spread my ass cheeks, descending gradually and licked the ass crack. Her saliva flowed to my rosebud, which was awaiting the arrival of her wet tongue. It ran on my asshole in circles, up, down, and sideways.
I felt my body shake and opened my eyes. There was Jean, smiling at me as she handed me a towel. I accepted the towel sheepishly, cleaned Juicy Lucy up so Jean could wax my vulva. I told her that I was going for a hot date that night and was daydreaming with anticipation.
"Unh huh," she nodded and proceeded to place the wax strips in place.
I did not care about this part. Surely, it brought the intermitting moments of pain as she pulled that strip, taking off some hair with it and I slipped back into the daydreaming.
By now, I could feel her raking my booty with her nails. It flinched and I never felt the pain form the wax stripping. She caressed my asshole, inserted a finger gently, and played with my smooth rim. Then she slapped my booty. It was a sharp hit, and another wax strip was removed. My lover reached around to tickle my clit and spanked me again. She continued to tease me, and I shivered for her touch. My eyes flew open and saw the smiling face of Jean who offered me another towel. Instantly, I blushed in embarrassment, mumbled another excuse coupled with a lame apology, and accepted the towel.
"Some lucky guy was going to have a good time tonight." Jean said as I cleaned up.
I applied the aloe vera to my freshly waxed snatch, and looked in the mirror. Jean was a deft girl.
"Damn it looks great," I thought and tied the robe closed.
Then I got up, gave Jean a large tip, hugged her, and left the wax room with elation.
I headed over to the other side of the spa for the remainder of my full body treatment. I could feel the Ben Wa balls undulating in my vagina with each step I took. They frolicked into the cozy yet wet playground, and sent me on the verge of orgasmic pleasure. However, I managed to hold the release and chose to savor the suspense that the evening promised.
I spent the next few hours in the spa where I was massaged, given a facial and a very relaxing bath. I had a manicure and pedicure. There was not an inch of my body that was missed from being oiled, rubbed or buffed. I felt like a celebrity. It got tickles, here and there. I was primed like a goddess.
The treatment was complete, I got dressed replacing the boots with a pair of black sandals so I would not damage my toe nails with the eye catching shiny black finish. Feeling warm ebullience, I settled my account and headed to an exquisite lingerie shop.
I entered the shop. Some women love chocolate, and for me chocolate is lingerie. I searched the store for the right bra and panties, a set befitting the occasion. The stuff set reflecting the love of two women. Jessie was a classy woman who took pride in everything she did. Therefore, I could not buy the slut wear. I looked at the thongs, the briefs, the boy shorts, the G-Strings. Nothing struck me right. Then I spotted a silky satin nude colored thong with lace. It looked "yummiest" with a matching lace bra. The material promised sex, class, and seductive for slut wears. The bra and panties would definitely invite someone to make deliberate yet passionate love to me. Perfect,' I thought with conviction, purchased it, and went out.
The Ben Wa balls reverberated as I walked. In my mind, everyone I passed could hear the thunderous echoes as the balls collided and recoiled off the walls of my pussy and thumped again. With a smile and a damp crotch, I walked to the el station with a cold wind blowing up my skirt. Lucy was still warm.
My errands were completed and the train was approaching the station. I exited the el station, headed to a diner for brunch, and something hot to drink. My body was burning fuel that I would later need. Waiting for my order, I sat there and dreamed of what Jessie would do to me that night. I felt nervous and yet excited for the pending cherry picking.
I stopped at the drug store and picked up the enema that Jessie had directed me to buy, but not to use. Only four hours before Jessie would arrive. My crotch got wet with anticipation.
I made sure everything was ready for her arrival. I was nervous like a teenager on her first date. Music was on, candles were lit, wine was chilled, and the meal was prepared. The only maneuver left for me was to put on the lingerie and wait patiently for her arrival. I was ready to present my anal cherry for the ultimate treatment. It took me 26 years to get to this point!
I removed the Ben Wa Balls, applied a little shimmer powder, a little perfume and it was time to get dressed.
I slipped the lace panties on and they fitted perfectly, hugging my curves like a sheer curtain for Lucy. The silky satin fabric was cool against the warm skin of my VJ. The thong kissed my rosebud, which ignited my vitals with the deep carnal lust. I selected a vintage black floor length peignoir to wear, slipped it on and let it cascade to the floor. The peignoir had an opaque black satin body and the sleeves and flowing cape were black sheer with ruffled black laced cuffs and trim. It was the perfect wrapping for the gift that I had to offer her.
I leaned against the window overlooking the street, apprehensively waiting for Jessie to arrive. My mind was racing with a bad case of the "whats" or "ifs." To calm my nerves, I took a sip of wine. Suddenly, I heard the door buzzer and the reverie was interrupted.
Three short buzzes, I knew it was Jessie. I walked over to the door and for a brief moment, my own eagerness hit me. I turned the knob and opened it. She stood there, clad into a pair of jeans and a bulky sweater. It was not the attire, I expected her to put on.
She looked at me. Her mouth opened a bit before she spoke, "Wow, you look luscious!" Then she entered the apartment without any preliminary.
In addition to her purse, she had brought a bottle of wine and a small nylon bag. I took her coat, the wine and reached for her bag. Jessie kept the bag to herself and went over to the bathroom. I hung her coat up and busied myself preparing the dinner.
Still in the bathroom, Jessie laid out oil, lube and the enema I had purchased. She also laid out some towels. Then she removed her sweater and jeans.
She had ample breasts, which could not be conveniently contained into her emerald green bra. She had a pair of matching Carnival French Cut Tuxedo bikini panties, which were skintight and hugged her smooth pussy. Next, she put on an emerald green lace camisole which barley covered her panties. Shortly afterward, I declared that the dinner was ready.
She walked into the bedroom, and laid out several items on the nightstand and covered them with a towel. Then, she went to the living room, put a DVD in the DVD player, and turned it off. She dropped the remote control on the sofa and walked over to the kitchen.
I heard the patter of her bare feet as she entered. I looked up and almost dropped our food. She stood there, with an aura of arousing exquisiteness. Her eyes followed my movements, like a lioness stalking her prey, as she propped herself against the corner of the doorway, sipping a glass of wine.
I looked at her and said with elation, "What a change!"
Jessie was a very attractive woman. She had rich, shoulder-length auburn hair with very delicate blonde streaks. Her eyes were brown, which she hued with emerald green eye and black eye shadow. Her camisole was a short, emerald green with lace, which revealed a glimpse of her emerald green bra and panties. Her 36C breasts were trying to escapes the confines of her bra.
I stared at her, fascinated by her takingness and blurted out, "Oh God, awesome!"
She smiled and joined me for the dinner that we ate in silence. After that, Jessie took the wine bottles and went into the living room.
I put the remnants of dinner away and the dirty dishes in the dishwasher. Then, I entered the living room. She was already stretched out on the sofa. I sat next to her and she turned on the DVD player. It was a porn movie on anal sex.
She whispered to me as if we were in a crowded room, "I am taking your cherry tonight, Sue." Then she smiled and we cuddled each other.
We watched the porn and went on with sipping wine. Jessie fondled my 34B breasts and played with my nipples but made no move to remove my lingerie. She pointed out things and answered all questions I had. She told me that she had been doing anal intercourse since she was 19 years old and enjoyed every second of anal. Her husband could not get enough of her ass. When the movie was over, we stood up and she led me to the bathroom.
Jessie explained that she was going to give me an enema as a first treat. She eased my peignoir off and laid it neatly on the counter. Then she stood in front of me and knelt down, placed her thumbs in the waistband of my thong and removed it carefully. I felt that the cool air kissed my pussy only to be followed by her.
She placed a large, fluffy bath rug on the floor and had me get into the doggy position so that, my ass was up for an easy access. Jessie picked up the enema bottle and lubed the tip. Next, she put some lube on my asshole and worked it in with her fingers. She lubed my rosebud and slipped the tip of her finger into my asshole, applying the lubricant.
When I was ready for another insertion, Jessie touched the tip of the enema bottle and squeezed it, forcing the liquid into my anal cavity. She pulled the bottle out, loosened the cap to let some air in, lubed it again, and reinserted its tip, squeezing the remaining fluid into my rectum. Then she removed the bottle and refilled it with water before going on with repeating her maneuver. When she was done, I felt her hand on my arm as she pulled me on feet.
I felt discomforted and full in the booty. She laughed at my pouting expression. Standing there with nothing on, except my bra, I looked at her and inquired, "Now what"?
Jessie told me to jump on my toes for a few minutes and I did. My little boobs bounced up and down. Jessie removed her camisole and panties with swift turns of her arms. She told me to stop and give her an enema.
I performed the same steps on her that she did to me. Now it was her turn to jump up and down. I was laughing so hard I almost had an accident. She took my hand and we smiled at each other. She asked if I remembered the Hula Hoop. I nodded and began to swing my hips as if I were playing with one.
What a sight that was! Two women dressed only in bras, swinging their hips and playing with some imaginary Hula Hoops.
We went on with playing and giggling like little school girls until she picked up her undies, and went to the bathroom to for some clean up.
"Sue when you are done, meet me in the bedroom." Jessie said over her shoulder as she departed.
After a while we entered the bedroom. She had her panties and camisole back on and I was clad into my panties and peignoir. We laughed, sat on the bed, had some sips of wine, and talked.
Jessie asked, "Sue, are you ready to have your cherry plucked and your ass fucked?"
I nodded and Jessie leaned over and gave me a soulful kiss. She laid me gently on the bed and we made out like two teenagers. We French kissed, and I licked her lips. Then she kissed and nibbled at my neck.
Her breasts, yet covered under camisole and bra, touched with mine. I knew her nipples were hard and swollen. I kissed her bust, slipped my hands under her camisole, and raised it to her arms. She sat up and I removed it from her body. Then I stood up and removed my peignoir.
We lay next to each other and French kissed again. Jessie moved her hands around, unclasped my bra, and removed it.
She nibbled, sucked and tweaked my nipples aggressively. For doing so, she had to stoop. I hugged her, fondled her back, and unclasped her bra. Her stunning breasts swung free and dangled above my face.
I could not resist an urge to take one of her globes into my mouth and held her nipple tantalizingly. I heard Jessie emit a low guttural moan and teased the other nipple by pinching it. She lay down and I massaged her succulent, creamy tits.
Our breasts touched and bodies shivered for an electrifying sensation. Jessie glided her hand under the waistband of my thong and her touch felt tickling on my vulva. I moaned as she continued to tease me.
Jessie fumbled with my thong and removed it deftly. She went down and planted a kiss on my pussy lips. Grabbing the sheet, I closed my eyes and raised my hip; it was an effort to intensify the pleasing contact. I squirmed but she had taken control. Oh, I was powerless!
Jessie rose, touched my breasts and teased my hard nipples. With each touch, my pulse raced. A quick lick, a gentle pinch, anything anything at all, but Jessie seemed to be harsh on me. No relief from the sexual tension was forthcoming. Yes, there was nothing for the relief as Jessie continued to torment me with her touch.
After a while, Jessie followed her instincts. She bent over and traced my labia with her tongue. I stared down and watched as she drove her tongue down deep into my pussy. I quivered and tried to hold onto her slippery tongue with my pussy, but my efforts went in vain.
She broke her oral contact with my pussy, moved up, kissed my cheek, and whispered, "Are you ready?"
I muttered "Yes," as she rolled me over with deliberation.
Jessie had me assume the Downward Dog Yoga position, which she quickly modified. She gave me a pillow so that I might rest my head on. Then she lowered my knees to the bed and placed my forearms flat against the outside of my legs on the bed. My ass was high in the air, totally opened and exposed, ready for her to pluck my cherry.
Jessie massaged my back with some warming oil and I felt the tension fading away. She moved her hands, oiling my ass cheeks and crack ardently. Some drops trickled down my asshole and rosebud. I gasped as she followed the oily trail with her finger.
Jessie focused on my aching asshole. She tantalized the outer edge, working her way to the hole and made an insertion. Then she retracted her finger, lubed it with some warm oil, and penetrated me with deliberation until her palm touched with my ass. I could feel her finger, touching, dancing and wreaking havoc into my rectum. It was a wonderful sensation I had never experienced before. Trembling with anticipation, I wiggled my butt for more attention. Jessie removed her finger and my sphincter grasped at it in vain.
Jessie was ready to move on and so I was too. I begged her to take my ass. She stroked my breasts, fingered my pussy, and moved on with tormenting my ass. Then she took a 6" long, dildo with slim and pink shaft, and slathered it with the lube. The toy felt thicker and longer than her finger as she touched the glans with my asshole and made an easy insertion; I looked like a milkshake with a straw stuck in it. Teasingly, she went on with fucking my rear, licking my pussy along.
The mixed sensation soared through my spine and I went delirious, moaning hoarsely. Jessie pushed the entire length of the shaft into my rectum and I felt a rush as I came instantly; my pussy twitched for the heat and the girl cum ran down my thighs. It was a warm, wonderful feeling that made me feel so dirty and sensual; a feeling I thoroughly enjoyed!
Jessie turned on a 7" vibrator, and touched my clit with it. It shook me and I bucked up. My vitals quivered with desire. I pinched my nipples and pulled on my breasts. She went on fucking with the dildo, removed it from my asshole, and replaced it with the vibrator. My sphincter sucked on the vibrator and the vibrations resounded throughout my body.
Jessie inserted the We-Vibe into my pussy to stimulate the G-spot and clit simultaneously. I felt an indescribable feeling of intense pleasure that radiated drove my womanhood ablaze. A vibrator buzzing away in my ass; another one buzzed into my pussy. Jessie went on with teasing me. She watched me with relish as my body convulsed all over. All along that, she brought herself to an instant climax with another vibrator. We squealed, together, in delight.
For the next episode, Jessie put on a black strap on with an 8" venous shaft. It was carved with balls and so, designed as a replica of the real "monster". Then, she put a large amount of lube on it and had me coat it.
I asked, "Aren't you going to fuck my ass with that?"
Jessie smiled meaningfully, and replied, "I won't hurt you babe. Just relax, and trust me! You will crave for more."
She positioned herself behind me, with the huge glans probing at my tiny backdoor. She raked my ass cheeks with her fingernails. My asshole tightened for an impending breach. Jessie pulled her hips back and spanked me hard with a riding crop.! Fuck my ass. Yesss, h-h-harder, ye-yess," I shrieked.
She went on with pounding into my rectum as if my encouragement raged her for an action. It couldn't be halted until I convulsed and cummed, so full and so satisfied. Of course, I loved the sensation of my ass being that full and being fucked to the depth.
Jessie was not through with me. She took a love stick and inserted it into my rectum, pressing against the We-Vibe and sending me into spasms of rapture. My body quivered for a mass of sexually charged nerve endings. Jessie continued pumping the stick into and out of my rear; each shove was better than the previous and so, she amplified my desire for the climax. I was on the verge of cumming when she drove the large prosthetic cock in for the final time. I squealed with delight. My chest heaved and I gasped to catch my breath. Jessie, panting with me, slumped against my ass. Her breasts moved in concert with her breathing. It slowed down as she caught her breath.
Jessie removed the strap-on from my ass. We unbuckled the monster from her hips, and collapsed on the bed in a pool of sweaty hot spent flesh. Tenderly I removed her panties, which were soaked with her nectar, and tossed them aside. I embraced her, caressing her pussy tenderly.
Jessie's face and neck showed flush of sexual tension. I reached out to fondle her breasts, but she held my hand lovingly and whispered seductively, "I have a small token to mark your special occasion."
She handed me a box, wrapped in a shiny black paper and tied with a red velvet bow. I kissed her thankfully, and like a child at Christmas, opened her gift eagerly.
The box contained a satin, ebony cloth. Nestled in its folds, was a large silver butt plug that was thick and long with a 1" stem at the base. The base in turn was encrusted with a red jewel and it was breathtaking absolutely. I could not believe that after all she had done for me tonight that she gave me such a thoughtful gift.
We applied lube to the shiny plug and I lay on my side with my leg cocked. Jessie sensually applied more lube to my rosebud and guided the tip of the plug to the entrance of my rectum. She placed my hand on the plug and then gently placed her hand over mine.
"Easy now! Just slide the tip of the plug down your ass," she said softly. "Push the plug in and you will feel a little resistance from your body."
I pushed, felt the resistance of the sphincter muscle, applying a little more lube, and pressed it. The sphincter swallowed the widest portion of the plug, locking around the stem of the plug to prevent an escape. The red jewel sparkled as it was the crown jewel of my temple now. Full and content I embraced Jessie and gave her a long passionate kiss. She tapped the red jewel sending a tremor through my body.
Jessie took a picture of me bending over with my new red jewel peeking out of my ass. I was enthralled with the evening and stood up, kissing her passionately.
We faced each other and held hands as Jessie lay on the bed. I gazed at her beautiful body as the soft candlelight danced on the subtle tones of her skin. The shadows from the candlelight pirouetted on the rich caramel color of her soft supple skin. I took her into my arms and hugged her warmly. I kissed her breasts, licked the erect nipples, and licked my way on her stomach until I reached her hollow. I patted her wet pussy. She hissed for my teasing touch and I eased my middle finger into her warm, receptive crevice.
Consumed by her radiating beauty and the essence of her womanhood that nestled between her thighs, I took a moment to enjoy her serene ambiance. Her vulva was tanned, bald, and smooth like a fine precious piece of the silk. The pussy lips were swollen, dark and luscious. They were soaked with her honey that had oozed already. The cunt protruded for the arousal and defined her breathtaking pussy. Her clit jutted out from its hood and her pink slit glistened with a minute line of over flown juice.
I licked my lips and slid up. We hugged, caressing and kissing each other. It was her turn to receive pleasure, my turn to serve her equally. I looked in her amber eyes and coyly smiled at her.
I cupped her face into my hands, and kissed her passionately. My tongue traced her lips, parting them ever so slightly. Her tongue met mine; the pair twirled and danced against each other. I knew she was fully aroused and wanted more than the foreplay that was being offered.
The aromatic musty odor of sex hung heavy in the room. I reached down once again and patted her hot, odorous snatch. Her engorged lips were very wet with her secretions. Jessie bowed her hips, as my finger penetrated her and touched the smooth silky walls of her cunt. As I increased the pressure, she began to thrash. My fingers frolicked in her pussy, cautious at first and harsh later. I led her ablaze in no time. Her hunger had to be fulfilled, as her body telegraphed the desire and the need to cum.
Jessie wanted a release; her body convulsed as she clutched at the bed sheet with one hand, and my thigh with the other. She screamed for the shaking climax and her juices gushed from her hot crucible.
I slid down and glued my face was to her quivering sex. I flicked my tongue on her slit, relishing with the flavor of her nectar. Warm, wet, and sticky fluid oozed from her cunt and I plowed it with my tongue, harvesting her cum. I sucked her swollen and salty clit and her nectar gushed out, teasing my taste buds. I felt the rich cream glide down my throat. Jessie had that rich womanly piquancy that I cherished. My tongue was searching for her erogenous zones that lay within her delicious pussy.
I licked down and up until I took her clit again, teasing it with my tongue. A vulgar, hoarse moan escaped her mouth as she bucked into my face. Her cunt quivered and opened, allowing my mouth and nose to go in. Giving her clit another swift lick, my tongue sought out her honey. Jessie wailed with ecstasy when my tongue flicked her twat. This brought her to a toe straightening and thigh tightening climax. She held my head and rammed my face as deep into her pussy as possible. Feeling her juice on my face, I inhaled her feminine aroma and went on with eating her. My body shuddered for the building desire and I was on the verge of a climax but I held back.
My face was buried in the best place in the world, the musky chamber of her cunt. Jessie had locked her legs around my torso, as she underwent a series of tremors. We frolicked in the throes of passion and her body got tense. She yelped and cummed once again, letting her juice out. I drank it to my fill and she groaned with pleasure and fulfillment.
Jessie was the woman who, just a short while ago, postponed her pleasure in order to provide me the pure carnal service and took my anal virginity away. It was the rightful thing to please her in return. Hence, I picked up my strappy and put it on. I was going to fuck her gaping pussy. Slathering it in the lube, I poised the glans at the gateway to her cunt. I pushed the entire shaft down her pulsating slit. It went slow and easy.
I struck hard, moved my hips back, and propelled the cock deep inside her pussy. Her muscles clinched on the lifeless shaft. She began to heave in the heat. Her breasts rose and fell lusciously. I squeezed them and she moaned as I went on with fucking her. Her nails raked my back and I winced with pleasure. She wrapped her legs wrapped around my hips. The effect pulled me above her and she screamed as my weapon hit her to the hilt. We made love with primal fury. Her eyes closed and then she opened them wide. I knew she was reaching her crescendo
Hence, she convulsed for a violent cum. This triggered my own orgasm and I cummed. Jessie gave a last burst of release and I lingered atop her, before taking the shaft out of her enervated pussy and unbuckling it.
We lay together, enjoying the afterglow of lovemaking, sharing the tenderness, the warmth and the sensuality of the evening. Our bodies entwined in unison. We spoke about our exceptional night, and the unique memory we would share for the rest of our lives. We spooned until a peaceful slumber consumed our etiolated bodies.
Epilogue:
Jessie is an amazing friend, who understood my needs and helped me to overcome the intimidation about the anal intercourse. She did everything possible to ensure that my anal cherry could be taken with positive and pleasing sensation. That is the reason for me to offer her an undying gratitude for the favor she bestowed.
It would be unfair if I do not thank the special women with whom I met at Lush. They bestowed me with strength, encouragement and sound advice to overcome the fear of anal intercourse. Some of them went so far as to have cyber anal sex with me, and provided a mental scope of a sensual fulfilling experience, which gave me the courage to lose my anal cherry. Thank you Ladies you are wonderful. I am now a proud member of The Back Door Betty Club.
Special thanks to Monica Marshal {obsessivelesbian} who supported me in by being a tough editor and good friend to help me make this a special story. Thank you my dear.
There are those who will say no big deal just let a guy peg your ass and get it over with. For a person with fear, real or otherwise, it is a big deal. For those contemplating anal for the first time and feel it uneasy, I must say just take your time and find a loving partner, who truly cares for you and so, you will not be disappointed. Enjoy the experience. It is truly a great one!
Now all that remains is to find the right man to fuck my ass with his hard cock and I think I know just the right man.

44.Panelist: Trump lives to divide our country
Panelists discuss President Donald Trump’s decision to cancel the White House visit for the NFL Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles.
I don’t know if these fools are from a different planet or if they are some kind of mind altering drug. To make a statement that PDT is dividing the country is absolutely redicilous. What he is attempting is just the opposite.
If anyone was trying to divide the country was Obama. In 8 years he did to the USA’s the same thing that Castro did to his country; put it back 50 years or more.
I would dare anyone to try and refute what PDT has done in 18 months, and compare it to what Obama could not do in 8 years. The sad part of what these fools are professing; they believe their own nonsense and have numerous followers that are just as brain dead as they are.
It may be that these PC-pathetics feel more comfortable on their knees instead of standing tall with pride. For some many years the USA has been in the prone position, taking buckets from other countries, our leaders and some citizens got used to it and adapted it to their way of life. Like the Dude, one of the greatest patriots our country ever had used to say; that ain’t the way it is supposed to be pilgrim!!
I can guarantee one thing; if CHC (Crooked Hillary Clinton) was sitting in the live seat with BBB (Brass Balls Bill) our country would not be as secure as it is today.
Count your blessings FOLKS and support the guy that is trying to save your country, your life and the lives of future generations.
Todays piece is from Australian artist Kain White. He is quite an exceptional painter. This piece is oil on canvas, and follows the same colors that he tends to use but not as brushy. He has some work where you can see how gooped on the oil is. It’s great. I do however like that this piece is not that thick, it fits how delicate the face is.
The contrast that the face has against that background is perfect, a nice glowing effect. I’m not sure how this looks like in person but I imagine that this picture is a good representation of the painting itself. For more of Kain’s work head on over to his profile. His homepage seems to be down at the moment, but I would still keep checking it.

Reviews
There are no reviews yet.Cameras watch us almost everywhere we go. We know the internet tracks our searches and purchases, and our smartphones can be used to monitor our activities too. As sociologist David Lyon points out, "this is a culture of surveillance."
In this watched world, our data is compiled into products to be used by businesses, not only to discover what we buy, but to understand how we are doing financially.
Credit reports, compiled from the data associated with financial transactions, reveal a great deal about us: How much we owe, how much we can borrow, whether we make payments on time and the names of creditors that have accessed the file. These reports may also include "local public records, social networking patterns, academic achievement records, mobile phone usage and non-financial payment histories."
I predict the next step in our watched world is the creation of a "wellness report" for each person. Like a credit report, a wellness report could collect all those little pieces of health-related data to paint a picture of our health or document possible illnesses.
Predicting the future
Wearable technology, smart watches and smartphones are already collecting our health data. They track your distance, speed and heart rate, and some can even note if your heartbeat was irregular.
But what if they went further, combining those little bits of data from wearable devices with medical appointments or food logs, stored in apps on your phone, plus the health products you buy and the prescriptions you fill, all recorded on your points card?
Many apps are already gathering information that is unrelated to their primary consumer use. For example, of the more than 300 apps studied by the Yale Privacy lab, 75 per cent host third-party trackers collecting data on our activities.
Taken together, a description of your health and behaviour begins to emerge.
Those who are very fit or healthy might see this as a good thing. However, technical glitches do occur and, when it comes to health, there is a wide range of "normal." So, even if you are healthy, you could be at risk.
Health data could be used like credit data to group users based on their behaviour and risks and create categories of wellness that influence your choices going forward.
With credit scores, our future credit-worthiness is extrapolated from our current borrowing behaviour. Credit scores control access to homes, vehicles and other consumer items. They help some people, generally those with steady jobs, and hold back others, including those who work part-time or are underemployed and can't always make payments on time.
The same might be true for a wellness report, with future illness probability derived from symptoms detected by your apps and wearable tech.
Banks, businesses and credit lenders provide financial support to credit-reporting companies. In return, they receive data that indicates their risk when they loan money. People with low credit scores are considered higher risk, and as a result, they have more difficulty getting loans or face a higher cost of borrowing —generally in the form of higher interest rates.
A wellness report could be a resource for private insurers, medicare and health-care providers to gauge the risk associated with providing a service. For example, a hypothetical wellness score —based on data collected and aggregated in novel ways —could determine how much you might pay for travel and health insurance —if you receive it at all.
In this hypothetical future, your travel insurance premiums might go up if your smart watch records heartbeat irregularities, especially if this is combined with data from an app that takes note of your appointment for a heart-screening test, or a points card that records your Aspirin purchase.
It's also possible that your health data could negatively affect your eligibility for certain health and medical procedures. For example, a procedure might be denied if your wellness report indicated that you might have an undiagnosed illness that could lead to complications.
Unhealthy errors
Credit reports are built and maintained without permission or notifying the reportees. They are notoriously difficult to monitor and correct.
A wellness report, if developed, would face the same complications. Errors might take days or months to correct, and might require experts or medical tests to disprove.
Like credit reports, errors in data reporting could harm those with flawed reports. The harms to the individual will be far greater than the costs to insurers.
For example, what if you were drinking coffee like it was water to stay ahead of a deadline, and the data from your wearable device and phone apps merged to show that you had high blood pressure or a slightly elevated heart rate? If this data were compiled into a wellness report, you might find travel insurance more expensive —or skydiving school out of the question.
Older adults are especially vulnerable to the negative impacts of health surveillance. Illness and disease become more common as we age, and the early warning signs may be detectable long before the disease impacts our lifestyle or behaviour. When it comes to health or travel insurance, older adults, many of whom who have fixed incomes, may be faced with higher premiums they just can't handle.
And what if credit and wellness report data was combined? Where would that leave the vulnerable?
Although countries offer advice and safeguards to protect consumers, the only way prevent this kind of data collection and compilation is through legislation.
We need to talk about these privacy concerns now, and insist on government protection, before private insurers and health providers invest in novel applications of already existing data to create and use wellness reports to protect them from risks —not us.

It has some interesting details about Alcott's family and life as a teen, even though it's written in novel form. The author tells more about the timeline and accuracy of the details in her story.
One on my shelf right now is A Mad, Wicked Folly by Sharon Biggs Waller. It's another YA historical fiction book...I like me some historical fiction. It was when I found good historical fiction that I then started liking history. Now I watch the PBS shows and other documentaries about history...when I was a teen that was not interesting to me at all. I like how good fiction can transport you and make you understand other times, other people and other points of view. It has always been what I love about reading...that magical feeling of being elsewhere while being cozy in your own house.
Hmmm, I'm seeing a pattern in the covers...faceless young woman in her setting in history with lots of scenery. Interesting.
I just finished a creepy YA novel phase where I read about ouija boards and scary dolls, so I guess that phase is over for now. I am definitely pulled in by the covers of books, and while this one isn't nearly creepy enough, I did really enjoy reading The Dead Girls of Hysteria Hall by Katie Alender. I think the girl isn't sufficiently scary enough for the asylum background and scary font. Maybe if we couldn't see her face like the above covers...lol!
Now that we've discussed what I'm reading and the cover art, how about some book crafts? I absolutely hated the idea of tearing up books for crafts, but then I got some free books (because they were damaged and not selling probably) from 2nd and Charles and decided that instead of tossing them into a landfill, creating art with them was a better choice. I don't find it as painful as I did.
Ok, this is just too cute and looks super easy...and it's very timely if you're looking to decorate for Halloween, click here to go to BHG for more.
This one is clever because I know that there are tons of books where the spines fall off, so if you remember to look out for those books at yard sales and library sales, you can make these great bookmarks.
And this craft would be fab for an art journal, scrapbook page or card. I can even see this as a pin to wear or a fridge magnet if you were to seal the paper and adhere the text to some stronger cardstock.
I'll leave you on National Read a Book Day with a little bookish food. I'm not sure I have the time to make my mini ham sandwiches look like books, but if you do, I'll be impressed!
Happy Wednesday!

Fun post!! Love all these book related craft ideas. The book pages butterflies look awesome!!
thanks, Cindy, I thought so too.it’s no more the situation. Now, you will find shops in departmental stores which focus on different budgets.
Shoppers prefer shopping centres/malls to face-alone shops for a number of reasons:
1. They their very own parking facility.
2. There’s a multitude of products available.
3. You will find products from competing producers available in one place. So, they are able to compare making purchases.
4. They’ve facilities for example restrooms.
5. They’ve gaming zones.
6. You will find food courts with a multitude of cuisine.
7. You will find cinemas in shopping centres.
All of these features making shopping an enjoyable-filled and satisfying experience.
Since shopping centres would be the most searched for-after shopping destinations, it’s advantageous for any businessman to setup an outlet inside a shopping center. Generally, store proprietors rent shop space inside a mall. Renting store space benefits the businessman in lots of ways.
• Departmental stores are often situated in prime locations that are readily available. If your store creates an outlet inside a mall, he is able to possess the shop inside a prime location having a minimal investment. However, if he attempts investing in a shop in this location, he might be unable to afford it. A rented property implies low energy production. This permits the businessman to make use of the saved amount on his business.
• He is able to attract clients of competitors who’ve shops within the mall. This permits him to construct a clientele easily.
• He doesn’t need to direct his efforts and time for the upkeep of the store. This can help him to pay attention to his business.
• Generally, the costs for utilities are incorporated within the rent. Hence, he doesn’t need to involve themself during these matters.
• At times, businessmen setup pop-up stores in shopping centres to be able to attract customers for brand new products. This can be a popular place for a pop-up store because it is a higher traffic area.
Because of so many advantages of departmental stores to shoppers in addition to businessmen we are able to conclude that shopping centres is only going to increase in recognition as time passes.GHOUL BRITANNIA

A bloc of Michigan voters see the media as dangerous to democracy, according to a poll released this week, an intensification of distrust that experts say is new and troubling.
State voters are reflecting a nationwide trend in which people are going to media sources that align with their own beliefs, a phenomenon that is escalating with the presidency of Donald Trump, media watchers say.
Most poll respondents disagreed with Trump that the media are the “enemy of the people,” but a majority of loyal Republicans and Fox News viewers agreed, according to a Sept. 5-7 poll of 600 likely Michigan voters conducted for The Detroit News and WDIV-TV.
“Republicans and Democrats have been complaining about the media for as long as there’s been politics,” said pollster Richard Czuba of the Glengariff Group. Inc, which conducted the survey. “But at no time, at least not in my lifetime, do I remember anybody singling out the media as dangerous to democracy and having their voters agree with them.”
Asked about Trump’s repeated claim that the media are “the enemy of the people,” 30 percent of those polled said they agreed, compared with 64 percent who disagreed. The survey had a margin of error of plus-minus 4 percentage points.
But 52 percent of voters who said they lean Republican agreed with Trump’s comments about the media, and 66 percent of strong Republicans told pollsters they agree the media are an enemy.
"It’s a big mess,” said Stephen Lacy, a professor emeritus at Michigan State University who spent most of his career in the School of Journalism. “We have known for 80 years that people tend to access information that supports their position. That’s not new. What’s changed is that we have more outlets that pass off opinion for news.”
The trend of passing off opinion for news is more common among national news outlets, Lacy said, suggesting MSNBC as an example on the left and Fox News as an example on the right.
The Michigan poll results aligned with respondents' own media habits. Fifty-five percent of respondents who said Fox News is their primary source of news said they think the media are the enemy of the people, compared with 31 percent for consumers of local television, 5 percent for CNN or MSNBC, 27 percent for radio and 14.5 percent for newspapers.
“What you have is one network disproportionately influencing one segment of the voting population,” Czuba said.
Federal law enforcement officials said last month a man who repeatedly threatened violence against the Boston Globe newspaper echoed the president’s claim that the media are “the enemy of the people.”
Trump first used the phrase in early 2017, suggesting in a tweet that “The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes, @NBCNews, @ABC, @CBS, @CNN) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People!”
Poll: No internet regulation
The question of bias also has been raised about online technology.
Trump in August accused Google of manipulating its results for “Trump News” to show negative stories, a charge the company denied. Top economic adviser Larry Kudlow said the White House was “taking a look” at how and if search engines should be regulated.
The News poll showed most Michigan residents did not think internet search engines like Google should be regulated to make sure that positive stories about the Trump administration are placed more highly in results.
About 54 percent of voters said they opposed creating internet search engine regulations to ensure prominent placement of Trump-friendly new stories, while 24.5 percent said they supported the idea and 13 percent were undecided.
A plurality of strong Republicans said they agreed with the call to regulate Google, with about 40 percent supporting and 34 percent opposing. But Democrats, independents and voters who said they leaned Republican disapproved, many of them strongly.
The poll results about the media come as no surprise to other experts.
While there’s always been some cynicism toward the media, consumers increasingly are faulting outlets whose reporting does not align with their own beliefs and lauding journalists whose coverage supports their views, said Josh Pasek, associate professor in communication studies at the University of Michigan and part of UM’s Center for Political Studies.
“I think it’s a general phenomenon,” Pasek said. “The way that it’s playing out politically at the moment, though, I think is more heated and politicized.”
People expressing distrust of the media tend to have very different definitions of what the media are, excluding Fox News or CNN from the definition based on which supports their beliefs, Lacy said.
In some cases, he said, media outlets have done little to help themselves.
When the media failed to predict Trump’s win in 2016, segments of the population felt it was because their plight was being under-reported or misreported, that journalists were “out of touch” with Trump voters, Pasek said.
Fake polls?
Political campaigns are trying to tap the media distrust.
The campaigns of GOP gubernatorial candidate Bill Schuette and Republican U.S. Senate hopeful John James on Monday questioned other results from the Glengariff poll, noting the firm was among many whose surveys had shown Trump trailing Democrat Hillary Clinton in Michigan a month out from the 2016 election.
Republican Party officials have said their own internal numbers did not show Trump leading the late-breaking race until four days before the election.
The Schuette campaign, trailing Democrat Gretchen Whitmer by nearly 14 percentage points in the poll, sent out a fundraising plea for supports to help fight “the fake polls,” echoing the president’s criticism of “fake news.”
The James campaign, down 22.5 points to Democratic incumbent Sen. Debbie Stabenow, asked for donations after a “fake poll was published that claims John James is behind in this race.”
Neither campaign agreed to release any internal poll numbers to dispute the findings when asked on Tuesday, but James campaign manager Tori Sachs said “our numbers show this to be a much closer race” with “a clear pathway for victory for John James.”
In a fundraising email that bashed the “liberal media,” Schuette political director Carter Bundy noted a Detroit News headline and Glengariff poll from 2016. “They want to discourage conservatives so they don’t go to the polls and vote,” he wrote.
Asked about the claims, Schuette spokesman Chris Gustafson said the campaign’s point was polls pointed toward a Clinton “rout in 2016 and that didn’t turn out to be the case so voters need to take this info with a big grain of salt.”
This week's Detroit News poll stories noted that surveys reflect a snapshot of voter sentiment at a specific time and do not predict election outcomes.
Czuba said his latest 2018 poll results suggest significantly different dynamics than in 2016. Voters across the political spectrum who were polled last week rated their motivation at an average of 9.4 out of 10, up from 4.7 points two years ago.
“Independents, the soft center, just wasn’t interested in either of the candidates” in 2016, Czuba said. “What we didn’t realize then is what they were essentially saying was, ‘We’re not going to vote. We’re not going to turn out.’”
But the distrust of journalists is legitimate, said Steve Mitchell, an East Lansing-based pollster and Republican strategist.
While Trump may have his faults, the relentless negative coverage of the president by mainstream media is clearly an effort to further divide voters and reflects the political stances of many reporters, Mitchell said.
People who distrust mainstream media sources will look for alternatives, outlets “calling balls and strikes,” he said.
“It’s unfortunate that the news media has become so biased in its presentation because it was one of those parts of society that people had trust in,” Mitchell said.
As news and politics become increasing national, stark differences in opinion become apparent throughout the country and polemic speech from the Oval Office widens the divide, UM's Pasek said.
“That’s a tough bridge to span,” he said.

More than 20 million Americans are either currently addicted to drugs or are recovering addicts. The effects of this abuse costs the country in excess of $18 billion a year, destroying families, causing vehicle accidents, resulting in loss of employment, increasing incarceration rates and causing serious health issues.
In light of these statistics, recent news reports revealing that undercover operatives with the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) continued to purchase crystal methamphetamine from suspected drug dealers for a full year instead of arresting them at once, are truly shocking. The reason for the delay? They were more interested in gathering enough evidence so that the men could ultimately be arrested for firearm possession than in stopping them from selling deadly drugs to vulnerable addicts. (Related: Lawless ATF raids small business at gunpoint solely to confiscate customer list.)
Agents focused on busting “ghost gun” ring
As reported by ABC affiliate, Denver 7, ATF agents purchased guns without serial numbers, machine guns, silencers and crystal methamphetamine from two men – Andres Luna and Jose Eduardo Trujillo – multiple times between November 2017 and November of this year. The men were finally arrested November 29, and are now being held in custody by U.S. Marshals.
Denver 7 reported:
Trujillo is charged with possessing “firearms which have not been registered in the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record.” Luna faces the same charge and possessing “firearms which have been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce as a person having been convicted of a felony” and possession with the intent to distribute a controlled substance.
A law known as the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record, which was enacted back in 1934, requires that all destructive devices, including machine guns, short-barreled rifles, short-barreled shotguns and silencers, be registered in the name of the owner. The sale of any other gun that does not fall into one of these categories must be logged by the seller.
The guns and silencers which the suspects sold to the ATF agents were not properly registered in terms of these laws. The ATF alleges that these “ghost guns” and silencers were stored and distributed from a building in north Denver.
The men face 10 years in prison if they are found guilty of the charges against them. (Related: Dysfunctional government: Head of ATF sacked as evidence mounts of a cover-up.)
While getting illegal weapons dealers off the streets is certainly good news, one cannot help but wonder how many lives were impacted by the fact that these men continued to deal drugs for an entire year while the ATF took their time building a case against them.

Chris Christie shrugged off Bridgegate as he crisscrossed Iowa like a presidential candidate. U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman dismissed reports of pending indictments as “almost entirely incorrect.” And Regina Egea, Christie’s choice for chief of staff, became the latest top administration official to testify under oath why she failed to properly investigate the controversial George Washington Bridge lane closures for months.
It all made for yet another confusing day in the Bridgegate scandal that began last September with inexplicable four-hour traffic jams, was overshadowed in November by Christie’s landslide reelection, exploded into a national story in January that threatened to torpedo the governor's presidential ambitions, and now appears likely to fade into the shadows until one or more of the several criminal investigations into various Port Authority-related scandals reaches a conclusion.
“Look, this is not a Made-for-TV reality show,” Assemblyman John Wisniewski (D-Middlesex), cochair of the Joint Select Committee on Investigation said with a touch of exasperation after reporters asked what he had learned from Egea’s testimony. “People may want to take a long commercial break because it’s a little boring.”
Wisniewski dismissed yet another call by Christie’s chief defender, Assembly Minority Leader Jon Bramnick (R-Union), for his committee to end its investigation. Wisniewski vowed that the panel would continue to pursue new leads -- including why neither Egea nor Christie turned over a December text message pertinent to Bridgegate, and which Port Authority police sergeant told Fort Lee’s police chief in September that the GWB lanes were closed because Fort Lee’s mayor refused to endorse Christie for reelection.
But Wisniewski said the investigatory committee has temporarily backed off its plan to call a dozen additional witnesses this summer, notably Charles McKenna, Christie’s chief counsel during Bridgegate, and Paul Nunziato, then the president of the Port Authority police union.
The panel has made it a practice not to call any witnesses without Fishman’s clearance because witnesses have a presumption of future immunity, and Fishman asked the panel to hold off. However, Wisniewski and the panel’s cochair, Senate Majority Leader Loretta Weinberg (D-Bergen), said they could schedule new witnesses at any time Fishman gives the okay.
Wisniewski said Fishman, as usual, gave no explanation for his request. “Give Mr. Fishman a lot of credit -- he is Sphinx-like,” Wisniewski said.
Fishman was a lot less Sphinx-like at a Newark press conference yesterday, though.
Asked about a report in Esquire magazine that he was closing in on indictments on four former Christie administration officials, Fishman said, "As you probably know, I rarely, if ever, comment on ongoing investigations by my office and I'm not going to comment on that investigation.”
However, he added,  indication that his investigation, at least, is nowhere near the release of any indictments, coupled with the adjournment of the Select Committee on Investigation yesterday with no new witnesses scheduled, could provide Christie with a Bridgegate-free respite to barnstorm the country for the next several months as chairman of the Republican Governors Association and move back up in the GOP presidential standings.
That doesn’t mean Christie’s troubles are over, however.
The U.S. Attorney’s Office in Manhattan’s Southern District and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission are also investigating a range of Port Authority issues, including the questionable legality of the use of more than $1 billion in Port Authority funds to rebuild the Pulaski Skyway.
Two state Superior Court judges will begin hearing cases on the legality of Christie’s elimination of $1.5 billion in pension funding this year and the suspension of billions of dollars of cost-of-living increases for retired public employees -- either of which could blow a hole in this year’s budget.
He still has to answer questions on the campaign trail about why New Jersey’s economic and employment recovery is near the bottom nationally, and why the bond rating agencies cut the state’s credit rating to a single-A level ahead of only troubled Illinois.
And Christie still has important staffing decisions to make, including whether he and current Chief of Staff Kevin O’Dowd want to move forward with his previously announced nomination of O’Dowd as Attorney-General, and whether Egea, currently the chief of the governor’s authorities unit, is still his choice to serve as O’Dowd’s replacement.
Both choices were announced last December 2 -- seven months ago by the calendar, but a political lifetime ago in the wake of the Bridgegate scandal.
It was O’Dowd’s deputy chief of staff, Bridget Kelly, who sent out the infamous “time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee” email. And O’Dowd evidently was oblivious to the overtly political operation that Kelly and her predecessor and mentor, Bill Stepien, ran out of the governor’s office.
Similarly, Christie has to decide whether Egea’s failure as chief of the governor’s authorities unit to sniff out the problems in Bridgegate disqualifies her to serve as a wartime consiglieri running the state government while he runs for president -- or whether her decision to stick to the confines of her job description is just what he wants in a chief of staff.
Like O’Dowd, Egea displayed “a curious lack of curiosity” -- Weinberg’s favorite phrase -- in accepting Port Authority Deputy Executive Director Bill Baroni’s explanation that complaints about the controversial GWB lane closures were just the latest example of “tensions” between Baroni and Port Authority Executive Director Patrick Foye, an appointee of New York Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo.
“I believed Bill,” Egea said of Baroni, the former state assemblyman whom Christie named to the senior New Jersey administrative position at the Port Authority. Because Foye did not explicitly state which laws were broken, she decided she did not need to notify Christie, O’Dowd, or McKenna of Foye’s allegations.Egea, who rose to a top executive position at AT&T before joining the Christie administration, said she accepted Baroni’s explanation that the lane closures that snarled traffic in Fort Lee for four days were part of a legitimate traffic study and that Foye’s memo ordering the lane closures revoked represented unwarranted political interference by New York officials with a New Jersey traffic issue.
She said she accepted Foye’s representation at the end of the September 13 memo that he would investigate the issue, but other than occasionally asking Baroni about the status of Foye’s investigation, she never followed up, despite increasing scrutiny of the issue by New Jersey and New York newspapers that fall and demands for an explanation by Weinberg and other legislators.
Egea acknowledged that she and her deputy, Nicole Crifo, hand-edited Baroni’s opening statement to the Assembly Transportation Committee -- a draft of which was driven to Trenton in a Port Authority car and then back to New York because Baroni evidently feared that if he emailed the document, someone might leak it to the press. Egea said Port Authority Chairman David Samson called her to ask her to edit Baroni’s statement.
She acknowledged that she “crisped” Baroni’s opening statement by editing out most of the background he had inserted on the three access lanes to the George Washington Bridge coming out of Fort Lee, including new information that the lanes had been in existence since they had been requested a decade earlier by Fort Lee Mayor Jack Alter, a former Bergen County freeholder.
Egea bought into Baroni’s assertion that the use of cones to divide the three GWB access lanes from Fort Lee from the nine lanes coming in from Route 95 was unfair because only “75 percent of the tollbooths were being used for 95 percent of the traffic.” That assumption was based upon Baroni’s analyis showing that “approximately 4.5 percent of all EZPass customers actually show a Fort Lee address,” a line she handwrote into Baroni’s testimony.
Egea listened to Foye’s December 9 testimony under oath before the Assembly Transportation Committee and was surprised to hear him report that the three Fort Lee lanes handled 25 percent to 26 percent of morning and afternoon rush-hour bridge traffic.
She did not report that fact to Christie, but she did text him to tell him that she found testimony by Port Authority officials Cedric Fulton and Robert Durando to be credible. She added that Fulton’s testimony that traffic studies are usually done through mathematical modeling, rather than traffic diversions, raised questions in her mind about Baroni’s judgment, but not his credibility.
Assemblyman Paul Moriarty (D-Gloucester) questioned Egea about why she had not turned over the text she sent to Christie to the committee, and she acknowledged that she had deleted the text sometime after December 9, when she sent it, but before January 8, when the controversial Kelly email turned Bridgegate into a national story.
Moriarty asked Egea’s lawyer, Michael Martinez, a partner with the New York City law firm of Mayer Brown who once served as Executive Assistant U.S. Attorney under Christie, if Egea would agree to have her cellphone scanned to attempt to retrieve the missing text. Moriarty said he would consult with Randy Mastro’s Gibbons Dunn & Crutcher law firm, which Christie retained to conduct an internal inquiry into Bridgegate for the governor’s office, before deciding whether to comply.
Wisniewski said it was “curious that the one text she had with the governor no longer exists” and added that he was troubled that it did not turn up when her phone was originally imaged by lawyers representing the governor’s office. He suggested that Egea “deliberately deleted” the text, and that “it was improper” for her to do so.
Asked why the Egea text to Christie did not show up in the records subpoenaed from Christie and the governor’s office itself, Wisniewski said, “That’s a good question.”Willie's "Getting the Most out of DB2 for z/OS and System z" blog.

We are not recommending fallback at the first hint of a problem - but that it is desirable to discover problems while fallback is available if it's necessary.
* Note: CM was referred to as compatibility mode in DB2 Version 8
Recommendation: It is recommended that customers do rebind in DB2 9 CM. 2) Following up on the principle established in #1. There are some changes to RUNSTATS.
New histogram statistics to improve filter factor estimation for range predicates when the literal values are known. New CLUSTERRATIOF algorithm. New statistic called DATAREPEATFACTOR (also known as DRF) which measures density of underlying data for each index.
Histograms are a "column based" statistic - they can be collected or not. The new CLUSTERRATIOF and DATAREPEATFACTOR improve DB2's ability to differentiate indexes by allowing DB2 better recognition of the true sequential nature of data and the density of data according to a particular index. So the customer will not fully experience DB2 9 optimization until after they've performed a RUNSTATS on all of their indexes and performed a REBIND. Recommendation: It is recommended that customers perform RUNSTATS + REBIND on their packages before converting to DB2 9 new function mode (NFM). 3) DB2 9 introduces a new feature called access path stability. With this feature enabled and used, DB2 will REBIND to generate a new access path and also preserve the previous (BASIC) or both the previous and the original (EXTENDED) versions of the runtime structures / access path. The design point is - access path stability provides access path recovery capabilities. If the customer performs a REBIND using access path stability and the performance for a package suffers, the customer can perform a REBIND SWITCH PREVIOUS or REBIND SWITCH ORIGINAL to restore the previous/original runtime structures and access path. Access path stability can be controlled at the subsystem level by DSNZPARM PLANMGMT in macro DSN6SPRM, which then impacts all package REBINDs, or at the individual REBIND statement level with REBIND parameter PLANMGMT. Recommendation: Our strong recommendation is to use access path stability because it provides a very quick and easy restore of the previous access path. Customers have had COPY / RECOVER capabilities for their data for many years. We hope customers will also take advantage of DB2's ability to backup and recover previous access path / runtime structures in the event there's a performance regression on a few packages. We recognize that customers may be constrained on catalog / directory space required to store multiple versions on the runtime execution structures (which are the execution instructions implementing the chosen access path). With this in mind, we provide three alternatives here..

Rick Creech "City Council revokes Noyes tenants’ relocation notices
Jia You/Daily Senior Staffer
The Evanston Children's Choir practices at the Noyes Cultural Arts Center, 927 Noyes St. The City Council revoked relocation notices to the choir and arts center tenant Maggie Weiss on Monday.
April 23, 2013
Hang on for a minute...we're trying to find some more stories you might like.
Evanston Mayor Elizabeth Tisdahl announced Monday night that the city will not relocate two tenants in the Noyes Cultural Arts Center, changing course from an earlier decision that raised controversy this month.
The City Council revoked relocation notices to the Evanston Children’s Choir and textile artist Maggie Weiss, which were issued last week to accommodate a proposed expansion of the Piven Theatre Workshop at the arts center, 927 Noyes St.
“While I am supportive of this opportunity for Piven to expand its operations at Noyes, I am concerned about the final process that brings this agreement to a conclusion,” Tisdahl said in a news release. “It appears that not all existing tenants at Noyes can be accommodated under the Piven plan.”
At an Evanston Arts Council meeting last week, tenants facing relocation and their supporters strongly criticized the proposal.
Gary Geiger, director of the Children’s Choir, said Tuesday he was pleased the council took the tenants’ concerns into account after the meeting.
“I was grateful that our voices were heard,” Geiger said.
Piven drafted the controversial proposal, which would expand the theater to two levels and more than double its square footage within the arts center. The proposal stipulates Piven would pay for the theater’s expansion as well as improvements to the aging building, in return for having negligible rent — $1 annually — for the next 25 years.
In an interview with The Daily in February, Leslie Brown, Piven’s executive director, said the theater would put $3.5 million into the building and take out a $2.2 million loan from the city.
Brown said the city’s decision to revoke the tenants’ relocation notices does not change the theater’s plan to move forward with the proposal.
“Piven will still go in front of the Human Services Committee on May 6 and officially submit the proposal for the aldermen’s consideration,” she wrote in an email. “Nothing has changed on that front.”
Geiger said he still plans to speak at the meeting next month, just as he had planned to do after receiving his relocation notice. However, he said his message at the meeting will no longer be one of protest, but rather one of thanks to the aldermen for reconsidering their decision to evict the Children’s Choir and move Weiss from her current studio to the basement of the building.
Despite the tenants’ relief, they believe the center still needs repairs and investment.
“Things are going in the right direction,” Geiger said of the idea that Piven will still spearhead the renovation project. “I agree that the building needs capital investment. Everyone agrees with that.”
However, he added that he does not think renovations to the building need to involve the displacement of tenants.
“If anyone is forced out, it leaves a bad taste in everyone’s mouth,” he said. “You want a place where everyone feels welcome.”

At the level of form, the first thing to do is burn all copies of the Bluebook, in its latest edition 560 pages of rubbish, a terrible time waster for law clerks employed by judges who insist as many do that the citations in their opinions conform to the Bluebook; also for students at the Yale Law School who aspire to be selected for the staff of the Yale Law Journal – they must pass a five-hour exam on the Bluebook. Yet no serious reader pays attention to citation format; all the reader cares about is that the citation enable him or her to find the cited material.

Monday, March 24, 11:14 AM CST
We haven't actually left yet. We are still packing. And repacking. And packing again.
Even Nasko is packing. He asked if he could pack a bag, so I let him. So far, it contains three pairs of fake eyeglasses, two glasses cases, and one set of plastic keys that don't unlock anything. I feel like he gets it. What else might one need when traveling to a third-world-country?!
12:18 PM
While rocking Louis to sleep for nap, I thought I'd research some of the amenities offered at the Brussels airport. I think I remember seeing a kids playplace there once. I pulled up their website and there's a news bulletin informing travelers to be prepared for possible delays... The president of the United States of America will be visiting Brussels on March 25-26. We cannot seem to get away from that man...
Tuesday, March 25, 2:25 PM
(Travel Day!)
At the Peoria airport, Nasko watched out the window as they boarded one plane. The pilot could see us, and he began waving at Nasko. Well, that was better than meeting a celebrity, in Nasko's mind. He started waving back like a mad man. He even ran to different windows to be sure the pilot could still see him.
This has done nothing to help the fact that Nasko believes he is going to be given the opportunity to "drive" our airplanes.
A little while later, Nasko befriended another man in a uniform. He held this employee's hand and asked the man to take him to our plane's cockpit.
Too bad this man was in charge of moving the luggage, not flying the plane.
[We flew from Peoria to Chicago, then Chicago to Brussels.]
Tuesday, March 25 (still? maybe? And I sure as heck don't know what time it is.)
The key to relaxation for Chance and I? Apparently a seven hour flight. I got to watch TV. TeeVee y'all. I never get to watch TV at home. And guess what?! The show had nothing to do with school buses or fire trucks. It was marvelous.
(I watched every episode of The Big Bang Theory that I possibly could!)
Louis fell asleep as we were taking off, and Nasko was content to look out the window or sit in his seat and play. Actually, the area we sat in wasn't too full. Nasko sat four seats away and was well-behaved. Who knew flying could be so relaxing?! I mean, I got to sit and watch TV!
[We flew from Brussels to Freetown, Sierra Leone, Africa]
March 26, 6:02 PM (GMT)
We survived! We made it.
I did not strangle either of our children (or Chance for that matter). We travelled for around 26 hours and it is officially over.
The best part about arriving (aside from seeing Rick's gorgeous white face, of course)? It was hot and humid when we landed.
Hot and humid. I was afraid my body has forgotten how to perspire (it's been a miserable winter) but never fear, the warmth was amazing. I'm sure I'll be over that in about 15 minutes though.
6:10 PM
Yup. Over it. The line for customs is long and there is no breeze in the airport. Or air conditioning. Haaawwwt...
6:30 PM
All of our luggage arrived! Praise God! We actually packed most of our clothing in a carry on and then divided the rest of our luggage among two other suitcases. We were preparing for the worst. For example, if one suitcase was lost, I would have been out only two bags of gluten free noodles, instead of four. It's all about the important stuff arriving...
6:45 PM
Now a three-hour ride in a truck.
8:20 PM
I couldn't stand it any longer. I made Rick's driver pull over so I could pee on the side of the road. The last time I came to Africa, I avoided having to squat and pee outside the entire time. This trip isn't off to a good start in that respect...
9:40 (May as well have been 2 AM)
We got to Rick and Paula's house, ate some supper, and collapsed into bed. We used melatonin for the boys on the way here and again tonight. That stuff is my new favorite friend while traveling through time zones. (I'm taking notes for when we all go to pick up E this summer!)
Thursday, March 27, 7:02 AM
Rick and Paula mentioned that most groups who come to visit will usually sleep in until 10:00 on the first day. Y'all. Rick and Paula will soon learn that my family is not "most groups." We were all up by 7:00.
10:00 AM
We've all had enough. We are all headed back to bed.
2:45 PM
Rick and Paula wanted to take us to a new beach they recently discovered. It was awesome! For sure Africa-awesome and probably even all-around-no-matter-where-you-live-awesome. The beach was spotless with light colored sand, big waves, beach chairs and a hammock.
In order to use this private beach, one must either pay a fee or eat at the restaurant. No cooking and delicious, fresh seafood? Alright. You twisted my arm. Chance and I had crab and shrimp (it was the same price as the chicken club sandwich!). Yum!
After swimming and playing on the beach, Rick mentioned that there was a shower with hot water there. His home only has cold water, so this was important information. We all took our first showers since our travels began.

Effective as of 25 May 2018Who do you think the most innovative person in the world is? I bet you won’t guess the answer.
The most innovative, creative and inspiring person I know isn’t often in the news or a fixture on the conference circuit. This person hasn’t won a single prestigious award or authored a single publication.
At a loss for the answer?
Well, I’ll let you in on a little secret. The most innovative person in the world is… my daughter.
You see, as I write this, my daughter is day six into building a rocket ship, one that will take her and her two best friends to Mars. In three days. On green energy. Using recycled materials.
Okay, well, really, she’s modified the box our new refrigerator came in. But I love her aspiration and I think there’s an important lesson here about the power of innovative thinking.
I recently had the opportunity to address a few hundred of the sharpest minds at the Disruption Summit Europe 2018. No one in attendance would have argued that rapid change in the world means organisations need to be faster and nimbler when responding to their customers and employees’ needs.
Yet the point I was making was that many of today’s incumbent organisations aren’t fundamentally set up to continuously innovate, whether they think they’re innovative or not. In fact, the complexity of their systems and processes – the rigidity and command-and-control structure – actively stifles the innovative abilities we humans have the capacity for.
I, for one, want to live in a world where my daughter’s creativity – her ‘shoot for the moon’ tendencies – are rewarded, not muted.
The good news is that the solution is well-within reach and already being embraced by leaders who have found that agile ways of working are unlocking huge gains.
By agile ways of working I don’t mean what your digital team is doing. This is not about tech, this is not about software. It's an entirely new way to run your business. And it’s not just for dynamic start-ups. Far from it, agility can transform well-established financial institutions, household names and industry stalwarts, ensuring they are fit to represent the future of the business rather than just its heritage.
Can old dogs learn ingenious new tricks?
Agile organisations put a huge amount of emphasis on making sure their people are engaged and empowered and part of the co-creation process. They take pains to reduce the layers of complexity and number of processes that slow decisions and the speed at which they can get new products to market. Speaking of getting new products to market, they’re laser-focused on creating value and are totally customer centric in their approach. They recognise that customers see businesses as a means to an end, and make themselves part of their customers’ lives, clearly demonstrating how they can help achieve their customers’ goals. And they’re able to anticipate changes in customer preferences and quickly shift to meet their rapidly evolving needs.
Agility is a winning formula. Our own research on agile ways of working shows the more financially successful an organisation, the more likely they are to display agile characteristics. Of course, financial performance is only one measure of success. Yet to operate in an agile way means to promote a culture where risk-taking is rewarded, where decision making is decentralised, where people are people empowered, and where an organisation’s purpose is so clearly articulated and understood that it serves as the ultimate motivator.
My daughter’s shooting for the moon. She may well get there. That’s because I’m confident that whatever profession she ultimately chooses, she’ll land in a place where agility isn’t something to aspire to but standard practice. And that her creativity will forever continue to flourish. That’s a world we can all look forward to.
Watch Sam's full presentation from D/sruption Summit Europe to find out how organisational agility can help you innovate.
Did you know the top 10% of financial performers are 30% more agile than the rest?Back in 2009 – when the blog was still a Bexis/Herrmann operation – we wrote a catch-all punitive damages post entitled (oddly enough) “On Punitive Damages.” That post identified and briefly discussed a variety of punitive damages-related issues, including what amount of increased risk is enough to justify an award of punitive damages under applicable state-law standards. We pointed out a couple of Restatement sections, Restatement (Second) of Torts §§500, 908, that defined “recklessness” for punitive damages purposes in relation to a “high degree of risk.”
That’s an interesting question, because a product that increases the possibility of death or serious injury due to some particular risk from one in a zillion to two in a zillion has doubled the relative risk – but in absolute terms the increase is tiny.
Ever since that post we’ve been meaning to come back and examine that punitive damages issue in greater detail. Today we finally get around to it. Because doing the job right would require research well beyond prescription medical products, we looked for research help, and enterprising (pun intended) Reed Smith associate Kevin Hara stepped up to handle the initial spadework. To put the question in the affirmative, can we defeat punitive damages, even where a relative increase in serious risk is high, where the absolute increase in risk remains minuscule? What increase in the risk of injury enough to warrant sending punitive damages to the jury? Is a one in 10,000, one in 5000 risk significant enough? How about one in 1000? One in 100?
Surprise, surprise, and as with so many other difficult questions, courts have not provided a definitive answer. In considering this question, we are reminded of some of the earlier Star Trek episodes, which explored not just the outer limits of the universe (and our minds), but also posed many interesting practical questions, particularly by Mr. Spock, the late Leonard Nimoy’s iconic Vulcan. In particular, “Logic clearly dictates that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.”
Although emanating from the Final Frontier, Spock’s pronouncement can make The Voyage Home to earthly product liability and punitive damages. In fact, product liability law often follows a “needs of the many” approach that supports research, development, and limitation of liability for prescription medical products, where large damage awards can occur in the Wink of an Eye and can result in The Doomsday Machine for such products. For instance, notwithstanding its eventual total victory, the maker of Accutane was forced to withdraw that drug from the market in 2009 due to the litigation cost of defending claims over purported side effects that either didn’t exist or were adequately warned about. Don’t get us started on older examples like Bendectin … or vaccines.
We’ll start where we left off in our earlier post – with the Restatement. Restatement §500 is one of ALI’s more popular offerings, having been followed by quite a few courts. It’s two-pronged, offering one definition of “recklessness” with scienter and one without. The former requires conscious (emphasis added). The second, more permissive, definition eschews actual awareness, but still demands a “high degree” of risk: “(2) where the ‘actor has such knowledge, or reason to know, of the facts, but does not realize or appreciate the high degree of risk involved, although a reasonable man in his position would do so.’” Id. (emphasis added).
Section 500 works in tandem with Restatement (Second) of Torts §908 (1977), which addresses the “reckless indifference” standard for punitive damages. Here’s how they work together:
Comment b following §908 further states that “[r]eckless indifference to the rights of others and conscious action in deliberate disregard of them (see §500) may provide the necessary state of mind to justify punitive damages.” . . Comment a to Section 500 describes two distinct types of reckless conduct which represent very different mental states: (1) where the “actor knows, or has reason to know, . . . of facts which create a high degree of risk of physical harm to another, and deliberately proceeds to act, or to fail to act, in conscious disregard of, or indifference to, that risk;” and (2) where the “actor has such knowledge, or reason to know, of the facts, but does not realize or appreciate the high degree of risk involved, although a reasonable man in his position would do so.” The first type of reckless conduct described in §500 demonstrates a higher degree of culpability than the second on the continuum of mental states which range from specific intent to ordinary negligence. An “indifference” to a known risk under §500 is closer to an intentional act than the failure to appreciate the degree of risk from a known danger.
SHV Coal, Inc. v. Continental Grain Co., 587 A.2d 702, 704 (Pa. 1991) (emphasis added) (citation and quotation marks omitted).
Another equivalent standard for punitive damages is that the plaintiff is “substantially certain” to be injured. That comes from the Restatement’s definition of “intent.” “If the actor knows that the consequences are certain, or substantially certain, to result from his act, and still goes ahead, he is treated by the law as if he had in fact desired to produce the result.” Restatement (Second) of Torts §8A (1965). Here’s one example:
[W]e conclude that a person acts in an intentional disregard of the rights of the plaintiff if the person acts with a purpose to disregard the plaintiff’s rights, or is aware that his or her acts are substantially certain to result in the plaintiff’s rights being disregarded. This will require that an act or course of conduct be deliberate. Additionally, the act or conduct must actually disregard the rights of the plaintiff.
Strenke v. Hogner, 694 N.W.2d 296, 304 (Wis. 2005) (emphasis added).
So, in order for an argument against punitive damages based on the low incidence of the particular risk involved to have a good chance of prevailing, the jurisdiction would have to make this consideration an element (or at least a factor) in its legal standard for the award of punitive damages. How many states have done that? We took a look, but first we had to eliminate those states that, for one reason or another, generally preclude punitive damages, allowing drug and device manufacturers to enjoy The Day of the Dove in common-law cases. According to a Supreme Court case we read (which we didn’t bother to verify), those states are: Connecticut, Louisiana, Michigan, Massachusetts, Nebraska, New Hampshire, and Washington. See Exxon Shipping Co. v. Baker, 554 U.S. 471, 495-96 (2008). As for the rest, here’s a list of those with punitive damages formulations that provide support for a limit on such damages based on statistical likelihood of risk. Not all of these states have actually accepted such an argument, but they could.
Alabama: The wantonness statute in Alabama requires that “injury will likely or probably result” from the defendant’s act or omission. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Thompson, 726 So.2d 651, 654 (Ala. 1998). Unlike the restatement, here the operative risk quantification is “likely” and “probably.”
Alaska: In Hayes v. Xerox Corp., 718 P.2d 929 (Alaska 1986), the court was “persuaded by the comments to the Restatement (Second) of Torts §500, which define reckless disregard of safety.” Id. at 935. The subsequent Alaska punitive damages statute retained the common law’s “malice” or “reckless indifference” standard, and added as a factor “the likelihood at the time of the conduct that serious harm would arise.” Alaska Stat. §09.17.020(b-c).
Arizona: The Arizona Supreme Court in Rawlings v. Apodaca, 726 P.2d 565 (Ariz. 1986), did “not believe that the concept of punitive damages should be stretched.” Id. at 578. It therefore followed Restatement §908, although it described the standard as “a substantial risk of significant harm” and “a substantial and unjustifiable risk.” Id. See Mein v. Cook, 193 P.3d 790, 795 (Ariz. App. 2008) (applying “substantially certain” standard of Restatement §8A).
Arkansas: Arkansas has a punitive damages statute requiring that the defendant ‘knew or ought to have known . . . that his or her conduct would naturally and probably result in injury or damage.” Ark. Code. §16-55-206. As in Alabama, the legislature used a standard somewhat different from the Restatement formulations, but the idea is the same.
California: See Schroeder v. Auto Driveaway Co., 523 P.2d 662, 671 (Cal. 1974) (describing standard as conduct “substantially certain to . . . injure plaintiffs”); Lackner v. North, 135 Cal. App. 4th 1188, 1200 (Cal. App. 2006) (approving jury instruction based on Restatement §908).
District of Columbia: Destefano v. Children’s National Medical Center, 121 A.3d 59, 66 (D.C. 2015) (adopting Restatement §500 “high degree of risk of harm” standard).
Florida: Dyals v. Hodges, 659 So.2d 482, 485 (Fla. App. 1995) (approving Restatement §500 as standard applicable to punitive damages); cf. Eastern Airlines, Inc. v. King, 557 So.2d 574, 576 (Fla. 1990) (adopting Restatement §500 in non-punitive damages context).
Georgia: Action Marine, Inc. v. Continental Carbon Inc., 481 F.3d 1302, 1313 (11th Cir. 2007) (“where the actor believes that the consequences of his act are substantially certain to result from [it]”) (following Restatement §8A standard) (applying Georgia law); J.B. Hunt Transportation, Inc. v. Bentley, 427 S.E.2d 499, 504 (Ga. App. 1992) (same); Viau v. Fred Dean, Inc., 418 S.E.2d 604, 608 (Ga. App. 1992) (same).
Illinois: In Ziarko v. Soo Line Railroad Co., 641 N.E.2d 402, 407 (Ill. 1994), the court applied “the definition of ‘reckless’ under the Restatement.” Id. at 407 (citing §500). Accord Loitz v. Remington Arms Co., 563 N.E. 2d 397, 403 (Ill. 1990) (adopting Restatement §908/§500 punitive damages formulation); Mathias v. Accor Economy Lodging, Inc., 347 F.3d 672, 675 (7th Cir. 2003) (“substantial certainty” of injury was “sufficient evidence of ‘willful and wanton conduct’ within the meaning that the Illinois courts assign to the term to permit an award of punitive damages”).
Kentucky: In Horton v. Union Light, Heat & Power Co., 690 S.W.2d 382 (Ky. 1985), the court applied Restatement §908, but without mention of Restatement §500, holding that that “evil motive” and “reckless indifference to the rights of others” are considered synonymous under Kentucky law, and that “[t]he distinguishing characteristic in cases where punitive damages are authorized has not been whether the injury was intentional but whether the misconduct ‘has the character of outrage.’” Id. at 389.
Maine: Maine has adopted a “narrower view” of recklessness than that employed in Restatement §908. Tuttle v. Raymond, 494 A.2d 1353, 1362 (Me. 1985). How that “narrow” approach translates into degree of risk is uncertain.
Maryland: Richardson v. McGriff, 762 A.2d 48, 94 (Md. 2000) (applying Restatement “substantial certainty” standard).
Minnesota: Kaluza v. Home Insurance Co., 403 N.W.2d 230, 233 (Minn. 1987) (following “substantial certainty” standard for punitive damages under Restatement §8A); see Gabrielson v. Nelson, 1994 WL 694863, at *2 (Minn. App. Dec. 13, 1994) (citing standard jury instruction incorporating “high degree of risk” standard for punitive damages).
Mississippi: Thomas v. State Farm Fire & Casualty Co., 856 So.2d 646, 649 (Miss. App. 2003) (applying “substantial certainty” standard).
Missouri: In Burnett v. Griffith, 769 S.W.2d 780 (Mo. 1989), the court adopted Restatement §908, holding that “the Restatement properly sets out the law in language readily understood by lawyers and lay people alike.” Id. at 789. See also Haynam v. Laclede Electric Co-operative, Inc., 889 S.W.2d 148, 152 (Mo. App. 1994) (collecting cases applying Restatement §500 as an adjunct to Burnett’s adoption of §908).
Montana: Owens v. Parker Drilling Co., 676 P.2d 162, 165 (Mont. 1984) (adopting Restatement §500, comment a; “a jury question of punitive damages is raised” where an enactment involving protection “of a person from a high degree of risk . . . is violated either intentionally or recklessly”).
New Jersey: New Jersey was an early adopter of the “high degree of probability of harm” standard for punitive damages. Berg v. Reaction Motors Division, 181 A.2d 487, 496 (N.J. 1962) (preceding adoption of Restatement §500). In Fischer v. Johns-Manville Corp., 512 A.2d 466, 480-81 (N.J. 1986), the court found that standard met by asbestos workers’ risks of chronic exposure to asbestos.
New Mexico: New Mexico follows the “substantially certain” formulation of Restatement §8A. Hartford Fire Insurance Co. v. Gandy Dancer, LLC, 2011 WL 1336523, at *13 (D.N.M. March 30, 2011).
New York: New York law requires conduct “in disregard of a known or obvious risk that was so great as to make it highly probable that harm would follow.” Saarinen v. Kerr, 644 N.E.2d 988, 991 (N.Y. 1994) (citing, inter alia, Restatement §500).
North Carolina: The North Carolina punitive damages statute sets the quantum of risk needed to support such damages at “reasonably likely to result in injury.” N.C. Gen. Stat. §1D-5.
Ohio: The standard for punitive damages in Ohio is whether the conduct amounts to “a conscious disregard for the rights and safety of other persons that has a great probability of causing substantial harm.” Calmes v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., 575 N.E.2d 416, 419 (Ohio 1991). See also Anderson v. Massillon, 983 N.E.2d 266, 273 (Ohio 2012) (following Restatement §500 as to recklessness).
Oregon: The general Oregon punitive damages statute sets the quantum of risk to which there must be a “reckless and outrageous indifference” as “a highly unreasonable risk of harm.” Or. Rev. Stat. §31.730(1). However, there is a separate product liability statute that also includes as a factor “[t]he likelihood at the time that serious harm would arise.” Or. Rev. Stat. §30.925(2)(a).
Pennsylvania: The Pennsylvania Supreme Court has expressly adopted the “high degree of risk” standard from Restatement §500. SHV Coal, supra (quoting Martin v. Johns-Manville Corp., 494 A.2d 1088, 1097 (Pa. 1985) (plurality opinion)). See also Evans v. Philadelphia Transportation Co., 212 A.2d 440, 443 (Pa. 1965) (punitive damages requires “that the actor . . . at least . . . was aware that [the harm] was substantially certain to ensue”).
Rhode Island: A Rhode Island trial court applied a punitive damages standard of “knowing and deliberate disregard of the objectively substantial certainty of those consequences,” that is, the risks at issue. Manocchia v. Narragansett Television, 1996 WL 937020, at *3 (R.I. Super. Dec. 12, 1996).
South Carolina: Addy’s Harbor Dodge, LLC v. Global Vehicles U.S.A. Inc., 2014 WL 4929335, at *10 (D.S.C. Sept. 30, 2014) (defining “malice as “[s]ubstantially certain to cause injury”).
South Dakota South Dakota has applied a “substantial certainty” of risk standard to punitive damages. Olson-Roti v. Kilcoin, 653 N.W.2d 254, 260 (S.D. 2002); Berry v. Risdall, 576 N.W.2d 1, 9 (S.D. 1998).
Tennessee: In Tennessee punitive damages require a “substantial and unjustifiable risk.” Flax v. DaimlerChrysler Corp., 272 S.W.3d 521, 535 (Tenn. 2008) (award allowable based on “consistent” adverse test results).
Texas: In Texas, corporate liability for punitive damages requires proof of “malice.” Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. C. §41.005(c)(2). “Malice” has been interpreted to include the “substantial certainty” standard. E.g., Vernon v. Perrien, 390 S.W.3d 47, 62 (Tex. App. 2012); (the defendant “believes the consequences are substantially certain to result from” its acts); Seber v. Union Pacific Railroad Co., 350 S.W.3d 640, 6540 (Tex. App. 2011) (same). This is not that different from the prior common-law standard. “[V]iewed objectively from the standpoint of the actor, the act or omission must involve an extreme degree of risk, considering the probability and magnitude of the potential harm to others.” Transportation Insurance Co. v. Moriel, 879 S.W.2d 10, 23 (Tex. 1994).
Utah: Utah has a punitive damages statute that codifies a “knowing and reckless indifference” standard. Utah C. §78B-8-201(1)(a). The Utah Supreme Court has applied the Restatement §500 “high degree of risk” standard to the statute. Daniels v. Gamma W. Brachytherapy, LLC, 221 P.3d 256, 269 (Utah 2009).
Vermont: The Vermont standard for probability of risk in punitive damages cases requires ).
Wisconsin: Wisconsin has a punitive damages statute requiring “an intentional disregard of the rights of the plaintiff.” Wis. Stat. §895.85(3). The statute requires “substantially certain” harm to permit punitive damages. Strenke, supra. See also Henrikson v. Strapon, 758 N.W.2d 205, 213-14 (Wis. 2008).
We have found a number of courts, such as those examined below, that have actually given meaning to the terms “substantial” or “high degree,” in cases involving plaintiffs seeking punitive damages despite the increased risk of actual injury being only slight, such as 1% − which we submit should not support punitive damages in prescription product liability actions. Perhaps the leading case is Toole v. McClintock, which reversed punitive damages verdict against a breast implant manufacturer, holding that the evidence of an actual incidence of 1% was insufficient to show that the manufacturer “had knowledge that the implants were likely to rupture when [the surgery] were performed.” 999 F.2d 1430, 1435-1436 (11th Cir. 1993). The court found that the plaintiff failed to meet the burden under Alabama law for “wanton” conduct (a basis for punitive damages) because the relevant consideration for the wantonness is the likelihood of the actual injury suffered by the plaintiff, ruling that “[t]he evidence in this case showed that the actual incidence of implant ruptures . . . is probably slightly less than one percent.” Id. (emphasis added).
Toole was applied in Scharff v. Wyeth, 2011 WL 4361634 (M.D. Ala. Sept. 19, 2011), holding that the plaintiff’s “evidence [was] insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact that breast cancer is a likely or probable event for those consuming” the drug because the “actual [increased] incidence of invasive breast cancer attributable to [the drug] was .42%,” – meaning less than one half of 1%, thereby justifying summary judgment against punitive damages. Id. at *17:
[E]ven construing the evidence through that heavily jaundiced lens, far beyond the light most favorable to the plaintiff requirement, the actual incidence of breast cancer remains too small as a matter of law for a reasonable jury to find that breast cancer was a likely or probable event. . . .
Id. If the relevant standard had only been negligence, a jury question would have resulted. However, those claims were independently barred. More was required for “wantonness” allowing punitive damages:
[T]he negligence standard is inapplicable. Given [plaintiff’s] evidence, and applying the plain meaning of “likely,” “probable,” “risk substantially greater in amount than that which is necessary [for negligence],” “strong probability,” “highly probable,” and “the risk is great,” there is no genuine issue of material fact.
Id. at *18.
The New York Court of Appeals unanimously affirmed the setting aside of a punitive damages award in an asbestos case, where the plaintiffs had “mesothelioma, a rare form of cancer.” In re New York City Asbestos Litigation, 678 N.E.2d 467, 468 (N.Y. 1997). Applying the New York requirement of a “risk that was so great as to make it highly probable that harm would follow,” the court held that “no valid line of reasoning and permissible inferences could possibly lead rational people to the conclusion reached by the jury.”
Id.
Applying that standard here, we conclude that the evidence is insufficient to support the jury’s finding of reckless disregard for the workers’ safety. At most, the evidence reveals [defendant’s] general awareness that exposure to high concentrations of asbestos over long periods of time could cause injury, but not that workers such as [these plaintiffs] were at risk at any time it could have warned them.
Id. at 468-69. Thus, the “risk” at issue in punitive damages litigation in New York is that faced by the specific plaintiff who brought suit, not some amorphous risk to the public at large, or some perceived Devil in The Dark that turns out not to be a threat, after all.
In Calmes the Ohio Supreme Court held as a matter of law that the risk of harm from mismatching of multi-piece tire rim components could not support punitive damages under Ohio’s “great probability of substantial harm” standard. That standard required a heck of a lot more than mere “foreseeability” of injury:
[Plaintiff argues] that foreseeability stands in place of great probability. However, mere foreseeability cannot be equated with great probability. In the law of negligence, foreseeability is the threshold level of probability at which conduct becomes negligent. Great probability, then, can be likened to high foreseeability.
575 N.E.2d at 420. The requisite “great probability” is more likely to exist where a product is used “in its intended manner with no apparent outside contributing causes.” Id. That was not the case in Calmes where plaintiff ignored the manufacturer’s warnings, and an intermediary (plaintiff’s employer) provided the mismatched components and failed to supply recommended safety equipment. Id.
In a situation with one-in-a-million odds, the court in Richards v. Michelin Tire Corp., 21 F.3d 1048 (11th Cir. 1994) (applying Alabama law), determined That Which Survives did not include punitive damages, where the plaintiff was injured by mismatched multi-piece tire rim pieces. The court required entry of judgment n.o.v., because “the evidence demonstrated that the actual incidence of mismatches was roughly one in millions and that [defendant] knew of only four other mismatch incidents.” Id. at 1058. A mere four mismatches didn’t cut it where “thirteen to fifteen million’ units of the product had been manufactured.” Such a low incidence meant the manufacturer could not have known mismatches “[were] likely or that the failure to warn [plaintiff] of the risks of mismatches made such explosions likely.” Id.
In another case with a risk of harm as remote as The City on The Edge of Forever, the court found that an incidence of product failure of one in 1 million failures warranted entry of judgment for the defendant under Virginia law. Dudley v. Bungee International Manufacturing Corp., 76 F.3d 372, 1996 WL 36977 (4th Cir. Jan. 31, 1996) (table opinion). There was no evidence of “wanton negligence,” defined as “conscious disregard of another person’s rights” arising from a defendant’s “knowledge of existing circumstances and conditions, that his conduct probably would cause injury to another.” Id. at *2. This standard could not possibly be met “[s]ince the evidence in this case shows the incidence of . . . failure was literally one in millions.” Thus, the defendant “could not have known from claims in two lawsuits that the design of its cords probably would cause injury to another. Id. at *4.
The Tennessee “substantial and unjustifiable risk” standard for recklessness precluded an award of punitive damages against a pharmacist for alleged misfilling of drug prescriptions in Beal v. Walgreen Co., 408 F. Appx. 898, 905 (6th Cir. 2010). The defendant’s “act of dispensing the drugs while it was cognizant of the general fact that mis-filled prescriptions could cause harm” was “not sufficient” in the absence of actual knowledge of the errors. Id. Tennessee law “rejected the argument that improperly dispensing pharmaceuticals” could “giv[e] rise to punitive damages on the basis that it ‘involved a dangerous or lethal instrumentality.’” Id. at 906.
Additional courts holding that punitive damages are precluded as a matter of law due to a probability of actual injury include:
Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Alexander, 868 S.W.2d 322, 327 (Tex. 1993) (“there is no evidence that [defendant’s] conduct created an extreme risk of harm,” because the store “averaged 50,000 patrons per month in the three months it had been open before [plaintiff’s] accident,” therefore any defect “simply did not impose an extreme risk creating the likelihood of serious injury.”).
Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals v. Havner, 907 S.W.2d 535, 561-62 (Tex. App. 1995) (punitive damages reversed because no evidence of “extreme risk” was shown based on 96 adverse event reports out of more than approximately 7 to 9 million prescriptions of the product), rev’d on other grounds, 953 S.W.2d 706 (Tex. 1997) (rendering judgment for defendant on all claims).
Lockley v. Deere & Co., 933 F.2d 1378, 1388-89 (8th Cir. 1991) (applying Arkansas law) (affirming directed verdict against punitive damages claim where there was “no substantial evidence from which a reasonable jury could have inferred that [equipment manufacturer] acted with such conscious indifference to the safety of others,” based on 16 similar injuries out of 39,000 machines).
Dow v. Rheem Manufacturing Co., 2011 WL 4484001, at *20 (E.D. Mich. Sept. 26, 2011) (two similar incidents “out of 40 million” product units over ten years held an “insufficient basis on which to hold [defendant] liable for gross negligence and/or willful disregard”).
Strothkamp v. Chesebrough-Pond’s, Inc., 1993 WL 79239, at *9-11 (Mo. App. March 23, 1993) (unpublished) 40 injuries over 10 years from some 36 billion product units held insufficient to establish high degree of probability of injury necessary under Missouri law to support punitive damages claim).
Despite logic indicating that punitive damages should be analyzed through a thorough consideration of the incidence of actual injury (a sentiment Spock would echo), all too many courts continue to allow punitive damages despite minuscule increases in absolute risk, certainly not The Way to Eden for responsible prescription product manufacturers. You know who these courts are, so a couple of examples will suffice. High on the list is In re Prempro Products Liability Litigation, 586 F.3d 547 (8th Cir. 2009), where the court affirmed sending punitive damages to the jury on the same evidence as in Scharff – a less than one half of 1% increase in risk. Id. at 573. Not without reason, Scharff noted that “the Eighth Circuit’s analysis of the relevant evidence and Arkansas law ignored the probability of injury and defendant’s knowledge of probable risk requirements in the plain language of the Arkansas statute.” 2011 WL 4361634, at *18 n.24. Fortunately, By Any Other Name, Prempro is at least in some sense dictum on this issue, since the punitive damages award in that case was thrown out on other grounds − the inadmissibility of prejudicial “expert” testimony offered by Dr. Susan Parisian, whose penchant for opining without foundation or expertise has been discussed here and here and here. 586 F.3d at 571-72. For this (and other) reasons, the Prempro decision richly deserved its ranking as the #3 worst drug/device decision of 2009.
Perhaps even more egregious is Drake v. Allergan, Inc., ___ F. Supp.3d ___, 2015 WL 2452947 (D. Vt. May 22, 2015). As we mentioned already, the Vermont standard for punitive damages requires “disregard of a known, substantial and intolerable risk” with “knowledge that the acts or omissions were substantially certain to result in the threatened harm.” Thus the result in Drake is ridiculous, as illogical as thinking that Tomorrow is Yesterday. The risk was never even quantified. Rather, the court gave the plaintiffs a complete pass, because of alleged off-label promotion:
The jury could have reasonably found that promoting doses above 8 u/kg created a substantial and intolerable risk of harm because doses above 8 u/kg were not proven to be safe and effective and nearly every incident in which a child was harmed occurred at a dose above 8 u/kg.
Id. at *15 (emphasis added). “Not proven”? In other words, there may not have been any increased risk at all. Everything’s anecdotal. Drake unacceptably shifted the burden of proof on punitive damages to the defendant – using an inapplicable FDA regulatory standard – despite universal common-law recognition (as discussed in the multi-state survey above) that plaintiff just prove an increase in risk sufficient to meet whatever standard that state law (or the Restatement) employs.
As our readers can tell, there are not a large number of drug/device cases explicitly rejecting punitive damages claims for statistical assessment of increased risk. In seeking to preclude punitive damages based in insufficient “high degree”/”certainty” of risk, defendants will need to scour the punitive damages precedents of their jurisdiction to find other precedents for dismissing such claims on low quantification of risk, because every plaintiff’s attorney wants A Piece of the Action with respect to punitive damages.
We can’t do so for every state, but we did take look for other favorable precedent in Pennsylvania, which required examining over 120 decisions. The only Pennsylvania Supreme Court case dealing with the degree of certainty of the risk for recklessness isn’t a punitive damages case at all – but a criminal case. In Commonwealth v. Young, 431 A.2d 230 (Pa. 1981), the court found the requisite high degree of risk present where the defendant “intentionally aim[ed] a gun at [a person] without knowing for a certainty that it was not loaded.” Id. at 232 (emphasis added). More recently, in Phillips v. Cricket Lighters, 883 A.2d 439 (Pa. 2005), evidence that “children playing with butane lighters resulted in the deaths of 120 people per year, with an additional 750 people being injured in these fires” was insufficient as a matter of law to establish a claim for punitive damages. Id. at 446.
We base our conclusion on many factors. First, the allegedly dangerous aspect of this product did not arise out of intended use of [defendant’s] product. . . . [S]uch a failure looks far less wanton than if the alleged danger arose in connection with the normal use of the product. Second, . . . [the product] complied with all safety standards . . ., [which] is a factor to be considered in determining whether punitive damages may be recovered. Finally, we flatly reject [plaintiff’s] assertion that [defendant’s] weighing of financial concerns in determining whether to incorporate additional safety features into its product on a unilateral basis establishes that [defendant] acted wantonly.
Id. at 447. Accord Thomas v. Staples, Inc., 2 F. Supp.3d 647, 665 (E.D. Pa. 2014) (similar case dismissing punitive damages arising from known, unquantified, but small, risk from misuse of the product).
Other Pennsylvania courts have used statistics, or the equivalent, to preclude punitive damages in Pennsylvania. In Acosta v. Honda Motor Co., 717 F.2d 828 (3d Cir. 1983), punitive damages were barred as a matter of law where the alleged design flaw existed in 270,000 product units for six years without prior incident. Id. at 841. In Pullaro v. Ricciardi, 2002 WL 31261102 (E.D. Pa. Oct. 10, 2002), “[k]nowledge of a previous [dog] bite [was]s not enough to establish a conscious disregard of a known risk.” Id. at *2. Finally, still other Pennsylvania courts have also rejected punitive damages claims as a matter of law because, for one reason or another, the increase in risk attributable to the defendant’s conduct wasn’t large enough. See Richetta v. Stanley Fastening Systems, L.P., 661 F. Supp.2d 500, 514, (E.D. Pa. 2009) (“that Defendant had notice of injuries resulting from its [product’s use], yet Defendant did not redesign its [product]” insufficient for punitive damages); Jones v. McDonald’s Corp., 958 F. Supp. 234, 236 (E.D. Pa. 1997) (no evidence that the place where plaintiff slipped was any more “prone to a heavy build-up of oil and grease” than any other part of defendant’s parking lot); Dillow v. Myers, 78 Pa. D. & C.4th 225, 240 (Pa. C.P. 2005) (“failure to check the driving record of a prospective employee or to conduct a driver background check does not create such a sufficiently high degree of risk of harm to others as to warrant punitive damages”), aff’d mem., 916 A.2d 698 (Pa. Super. 2007).
Given the state of the law, in most jurisdictions, successful assertion of lack of sufficient increased risk as a defense to punitive damages will require searching the law of that state in the manner we just did for Pennsylvania. Though the exact degree of increased risk is subject to debate, low absolute additional risk, as in the cases we’ve discussed should not, as a matter of law support an award of punitive damage. As the Scharff court aptly stated, courts should examine the probability or likelihood of the risk of actual injury (which is similar to the punitive damages standards in many states) before a prescription drug or device manufacturer is acquired to pay punitive damages. Otherwise, as in the case of the Accutane litigation, potentially life-altering and life-saving products which represent The Needs of The Many may be severely curtailed or even eliminated by unjustified damages awards, and preventing A Return to Tomorrow.North Carolina has spent more than $150 million since 2012 on the Read To Achieve program, but not much more than half of the state’s youngest students are reading at grade level.
The past six years have seen major changes in how reading is taught in elementary schools, with more testing and more support for students who need help, such as through summer reading camps. But as state education leaders reviewed the data Wednesday, they said that North Carolina isn’t seeing much progress in getting more children reading at grade level by third grade.
“The recent data that we’ve looked at over the past few months shows that in some grades we’re treading water,” said State Board of Education member J.B. Buxton, chairman of the student learning and achievement committee. “In other grades, like third grade, we’re actually moving backwards.”
The General Assembly passed Read to Achieve legislation in 2012. It was modeled on literacy efforts in other states, including the “Just Read, Florida!” program created by former Gov. Jeb Bush in 2001. The goal in North Carolina was to end “social promotion” by keeping students in third grade until they could read at grade level and providing extra support to help them get there, as the News & Observer previously reported.

The state has spent $151.7 million on Read To Achieve, much of it for digital devices for elementary schools and summer camps to help young readers who fall behind, as the News & Observer previously reported.
But the latest state data shows only 52 percent of first-grade students are reading at grade level. It rises to 56 percent in second grade.
“By the end of second grade we’re making very little progress,” Buxton said.
The passing rate on the state’s third-grade reading exams is now at 55.9 percent. It was at 60.2 percent in the 2013-14 school year.
Researchers at N.C. State University’s Friday Institute found no gains from implementing Read To Achieve.
The state Department of Public Instruction isn’t recommending any legislative changes to Read To Achieve. Instead, officials said Wednesday they’re looking at how to change implementation of the current law, including recommending ways for school districts to improve their summer reading camps.
“We really need to work a lot to make these reading camps something that is valuable for students,” said Tara Galloway, DPI director of K-3 literacy.
Galloway said more focus is needed on early literacy to make sure teachers provide their students with the foundational reading skills they need. She warned that not addressing reading at an early age will allow achievement gaps to take hold.
“If they move forward grade after grade after grade without those foundational reading skills it will catch up with them,” Galloway told state board members. “That’s what we’re seeing.
“The data is showing us that those foundational reading skills were not built back in the early grades and so by third grade it’s showing up that they’re not able to read to learn. They never learned to read so they can’t read to learn.”
Trip Stallings, one of the N.C. State researchers who reviewed Read To Achieve, echoed Galloway’s recommendations.
“The most important thing that you can consider is those early grade interventions,” he said.or make 4 interest-free payments of

A week after the arrival of Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse, and just in time for the holidays, Sony has dropped off a special compilation Christmas project, outfitted with yuletide tracks performed by the various Spider-Men featured in the comic book character’s latest film. In the actual movie, there’s a joke about Spider-Man launching his own Christmas album and in the interest of consistent branding, we’ve been gifted with one IRL.
Only packaged into five tracks total, you’ll catch Shameik Moore’s Spider-Man opening things up with his own take on “Joy To The World,” before finding company in Chris Pine’s Peter Parker, who graces cuts like “Spidey-Bells (A Hero’s Lament),” while Jake Johnson’s Spidey flexes his chops of “Deck The Halls.”
The project’s closer is a spoken word piece, “The Night Before Christmas 1967,” narrated by Jorm Taccone’s Green Goblin. Listen in full down below.

Bonus Myth! It is a myth that cybercriminals hack into people social media accounts. Cybercriminals don’t usually hack an account by guessing your passwords or using software designed to get around a network security measure. They get access from you directly. Usually what happens is they create a profile of who you are, what you do, who your friends are and what you're connected to. They start a phishing campaign, which asks you to log into a fake website about something you're interested in or connected to. Most users don’t use lots of different passwords, so if you fall for this trap, they have your password and username. At this point, they begin to test your actual accounts until they breach one. We have written many articles about cybersecurity. I recommend you read a few of them. Always set your social media security and privacy settings as high as possible. Make sure you also have active and up-to-date antimalware defenses running at all times and change your password at least once a year. Make the new password different and diverse, at least 12 characters long, using numbers, letters and special characters. Social media security is no joke. It costs billions of dollars in losses each year, and breaches often start with social media profiling. Now let’s look at myth #25.
Myth #25 You Get the best Coverage by Posting the Same Thing to all your Platforms. I know that anyone can post the same curated content to multiple platforms simultaneously and you will generate good traffic. However, you will not be optimizing your return for the different social platforms. Each social platform has different rules, the number of characters you can post, how images are used, etc. On top of this, the subscribers of different social platforms have different usage times and habits. They all have different peak usage times. To get the most traffic, you have to customize your post for each platform and also make sure you are posting at the ideal time for that platform for your subscribers.
Myth #26 Google Plus is Dead. I have heard this myth many times, but the fact is Google + is alive and kicking. It has a lot of active communities, especially in the scientific sector. If you don’t believe me, just open your Google + account (if you have a Gmail account, you also have access to Google +) and click on “Community” and then search for anything you want. You will be surprised at the number of community groups there are. Google has a massive captive audience; it should not be ignored.
Myth #27 Any time is the Best Time to Post. This myth is perpetuated by the need for convenience. I hear people say when you find something interesting or useful, you should share it right there and then. It's true this helps you stay active and engaging, but it does not mean that you are posting at the best time of day. As mentioned in Myth #25, subscribers for every social platform have their own habits, and their usage differs by age, socioeconomics, demographics and platform. You need to learn what these habits are, so you can schedule your posting time to maximize the number of people who see your post.
Myth #28 Schedule Posts are Not as Good as Live Posts. For the most part, people don’t know (or care) if a post was entered “Live” or “Scheduled”! What is important is that the post be useful in some way to the audience. It is possible to figure out if a post was scheduled, but few if any have time for that. Just make sure you're providing high quality, useful, relevant, timely, or entertaining curated and authoritative posts, and people will consume your content.
Myth #29 It’s OK to Post Any Images you find Online. This is a big problem on the internet. So many images are easily accessible to anyone with a browser. However, most images are copyrighted. It's stealing if you use a copyrighted image of any kind. Make sure you either have permission to use an image, or its license is listed as free to use commercially. Even if you use Google Advanced image tool, many of the images listed are still copyrighted even though they say, “free to use.” I always select images from databases like “Pixabay” that “says their images are free to use”!
Myth #30 Major Brands Should Only use one Business or Corporate voice. This myth has to do with how personal your social voice is. Many name brands only “speak in a corporate tone.” They rarely pull off their corporate mask and speak to people in everyday language on a personal level. I’m not saying you shouldn’t be professional; this is a must. However, it’s important to use the same level of language, tone, and demeanor in your prose that your audience uses. If you want to engage people, you need to communicate on their level. Otherwise, it will seem like a commercial.
Myth #31 You Have to Have a Huge Following to be Successful. There is no doubt that if you have a huge following, you’re more likely to be successful than not. Having said that, you don’t have to have a million followers, or even 100,000 to get a great return on your social media. However, you do have to have a few thousand people paying attention to be able to gauge any impact that your messages have. If your number is too small (say 200 followers), your message may not register any significant impact, even though it was a good message. Take the time to grow your following. It doesn’t have to be huge, but it still should be at least 1000 followers if you want to get a return on your time and money.
Myth #32 It’s OK to Use lots of Hashtags. I often see posts with three hashtags! This is considered very poor form and it makes a user look ignorant of internet culture and accepted methodologies. I tell people to try and stick to only one hashtag if possible and never use more than two (only in long posts). Another related issue is people hijacking someone else’s hashtags. Again, this is considered very poor form and makes you look like a copycat, trying to steal someone else’s thunder. Read our article called; “Hashtagging for Business - The use of Hashtags Made Easy” for more details.
Myth #33 Social Media Can Replace all other Web Properties. Today, there are a lot of small businesses that only have a Facebook page or are just using free social network accounts. This is OK, but it is far from ideal. In fact, I think this is a mistake. In the 80’s you needed to be in the Yellow Pages. Today, you still need to have a website of some kind that you have control over. Social networks are fickle and can remove you for any reason they deem fit. This can’t happen with a website. If you own a URL and have paid for your hosting, it can’t be removed easily. In time, all web properties will become accepted as more or less equal, but today a website has more credibility, and prestige than a social media page. The most important factor is that a website will rank better and give the owner more control.
Myth #34 Any College Student Can Perform your Social Media Marketing. There is no doubt that younger people usually learn new technologies faster and are more fearless when it comes to adopting new things. Internet marketing is no exception. However, social media changes very often and quickly. On top of this issue, marketing is a skill that takes time to learn. An experienced social media marketer will usually outperform an inexperienced college student on multiple platforms. An experienced professional’s productivity may cost more per hour, but their return on investment is usually double or triple the cheap labor you get from a college student.
Myth #35 Social Media Can’t Be Used for Customer Service. Social Media is actually a great way to provide customer service, provided you have someone monitoring the account. You can directly communicate with a customer who is having an issue in real time without the cost of special software, chat services or bots. If a customer is irate, you can ask them to take it offline and take care of the customers’ needs in a more private setting via telephone or direct support software. If the customer just has questions, you can provide additional resources via links and downloadable pdf’s, etc. Social media has been a boon to many companies who have embraced it as a customer service tool. Not doing so, just leaves the negative posts on your website instead of testimonials from happy customers whose problems you have solved.
Myth #36 A Steller Business Reputation Can’t be Harmed by Social Media. Here’s a news flash. If you’re not proactively managing your reputation on social media, you're setting yourself up to make sure that your reputation is predominantly negative. A person who feels they have been wronged is ten times more likely to complain via social media than someone who is happy with your services. In fact, when a person is happy with your service, they rarely post a recommendation (unless you ask them to). Make sure you are actively asking happy customers to post testimonials, positive recommendations and 5-star ratings for your company, products, and service. Failure to do so will eventually just leave the negative comments.
Social media myths come and go, and they exist because social media exists. The public and advertising industry creates these myths. Some by accident, some out of ignorance and some because marketing people exaggerate the results. Remember it's important to be proactive with social media. Make sure you are proactive with your social media security. Try to post useful content each day. If your business is not actively managing social media, it will actively affect your business (usually negatively). So, do yourself a favor and actively engage in social media marketing and don’t believe hearsay or myths. Check references and choose a professional who can provide some guarantees. Not doing your due diligence will cost you and leave you living in your own social media myths!
That's my opinion; I look forward to reading yours.

Tradition, experience and hospitality
My grandparents Colombo and Maria, Erica & Ennio parents and pending their third daughter Daniela, in 1958 decided to build a house with some rooms to rent in Alba .
In order to fulfill their dream they worked, and as we see from the picture even the pregnant Maria grandmother worked hard in the yard.
In the fall of '58 their house was ready: it was called LA MARIA TERESA.
In 1961 the villa was enlarged.
A new piece was built for the dining room and some rooms were added.
The villa was renamed: VILLA ADRIA.
In 1974 a further expansion became a bar, a new dining room, as well as other bedrooms.
In 1983, Colombo and Maria retire and take their place the daughter Erica.
The most challenging project was carried out in 2003. It has added a structure of seven floors, where now are also the new apartments.
Now Erica with family manages the HOTEL VILLA ADRIA with the same courtesy and hospitality inherited from the parents.
It is with great emotion that I sincerely thank my grandparents for all they have done for us, and my parents for what they are doing today.

A summer that , with the many visitors who came in Penia and see the precious collection of objects collected with great passion during his adventurous life, had finally bestowed the right reputation. But thanks to the will of his wife Maria and family, the museum will stay open.
To Colombo Dantone we must sincerely say thank you for his life, for what its objects tell us, for what this collection reveals to each of us.Order by: most recent most popular relevance

Captain Hutton rode in the Charge of the Light Brigade at the Battle of Balaklava (1854). He was shot through the right thigh during the advance of the Light Cavalry Brigade and on returning from the guns he was again severely wounded through the left thigh. His horse was wounded in 11 places and had to be destroyed.
After treatment at Scutari and Malta, Hutton returned to England in March 1855 and received his Crimea War Medal from Queen Victoria at the presentation ceremony on Horse Guards Parade, 18 May 1855. He retired from the Army as brevet-major by sale of his commission in 1857.Why Food Cooks Slower in Oil than in Water
There's more to cooking speed than just temperature.

One of the niftiest things we learned from our Poached Fish Fillets recipe is that the fish cooks more gently (and slowly) in oil than in water—even when both liquids are exactly the same temperature. This is true, it turns out, not just for fish but for any other food, including eggs (see photos below). and will cook it more slowly.
While we understood the concept, it seemed to defy common sense. So we decided to check it out using our own senses. We heated equal amounts of water and oil to 135 degrees and then asked test cooks to stick a finger in each liquid simultaneously. Testers immediately snatched their fingers out of the water, which felt very hot, but left them in the oil, which felt merely warm. Point proved.

Yesterday I bought a Samsung J7 but I don't know if it is fake or real one?
I bought it yesterday, and I only got 3 languages I know 2 of the 3. 1 of them is Chinese, and the other one is English. When I did a hard reset, the language was in Chinese. On the back cover that plastic thing it said on it: China Mobile 4GLTE.
It sounds like you have a cloned device. The Samsung Language packs that are pre-installed have a variety of different languages and dialect. Since you just purchased the device yesterday, you should be able to return it and get your money back.

You also need a good mix of "patience and opportunism", Munger adds.
Buffett's belief in playing the long game is well documented. Investing on value and forgetting about what the market does week to week or month to month is a key part of the formula.
Buffett claims he's had good luck too, but when pushed he'll admit he does have something of a knack for "pattern recognition."
He is fascinated by the world of micro-economics but isn't much interested in macro-economics at all - laughing when asked what he thinks will happen to the price of oil.
Munger, who's old enough to have worked for Buffett's grandfather in the original family grocery store, is even more direct.
"Micro-economics is business," he says. "Macro-economics is what you put up with."
It's that kind of worldview that has Buffett confident about Berkshire Hathaway's prospects under a potential Donald Trump presidency - even though he makes it clear he really doesn't like the guy.
Asked if Trump would be a risk for his business, he replies that if he wins..."that won't be the main problem."
After the applause dies down he elaborates: "If Donald or Hillary win Berkshire will do just fine."
The company had operated under regimes of high tax and regimes of price control, he says.
"Business in this country has done extraordinarily well for 200 years. No President or Presidential candidate will end that," he says. "The majority of the American public seem to think its a bad time to be born today. They're wrong."
American GDP is per capita is now six times what it was when he was born, he points out.
"The system is working very well in terms of aggregate output. In terms of distribution it falls short, my view."
Buffett and Munger are deeply committed to the idea that they are ethical investors. They don't like casinos, they don't like tobacco and they are big on renewable energy investment. They don't even like derivatives, which they blame for the global financial crisis, although they admit they haven't been able to avoid making $20 billion on them in their latest result because they own bank stock.
Its "awkward" Munger says. "Really we'd prefer if they were illegal, it would be better for the banks and the US.
Contemplating the meaning of happiness and their legacy, the 92 year old says: "There are a lot of people making a lot of money and everyone hates them and the way they make money. We're really trying to behave well."
Unsuprisingly then Buffett is at his most defensive dealing with questions about the ethics of Coca-cola and the sugar debate.
Berkshire Hathaway owns about 10 per cent of Coca-cola as well as a sizeable chunk of Mars corporation and all of popular US candy company See's.
They are men of their generation and refuse to back down on their belief that these are treats that bring happiness to the world.
Throughout the meeting Buffett sips coke and Munger chomps on See's Peanut Brittle.
"I'm about a quarter coke," says Buffett who claims to drink about five cans a day - consuming about 700 of his daily 2700 calorie intake that way.
"You get the choice," he says. "I choose to get my calories from things that make me feel good when I eat them. I wish I had a twin that just ate broccoli, I'm not sure he'd have done any better."
Buffett is a charismatic figure and his folksy wisdom has inspired an almost cult like devotion from his followers.
But when it comes to holding a crowd for five hours it is Munger and the pair's double act of odd ball quips and kooky old home truths that really make it a compelling show.
Asked why Berkshire Hathaway doesn't follow the increasingly common practice of breaking out "unusual" costs when they report operating profit, Munger responds: "That's like asking why don't you kill your grandmother to get the insurance! We're not interested in manipulating our numbers and we're not about to start."
It's appropriate then that Buffett throws the last question of the day - about the pair's sense of humour - to Munger.
"If you see the world accurately its bound to be humorous," he says. "Because it's ridiculous."

State-backed Permanent TSB sparked outcry yesterday when it was revealed that it was to sell a €4bn portfolio of non-performing loans. But what does this mean for people who have such loans?
What are non-performing loans?
A non-performing loan is a loan that is in default or close to default.
What is the level of non-performing loans that PTSB has on its books?
Non-performing loans represent 28pc of the banks loan book – the highest among Irish lenders. A successful deal would reduce that figure to close to 10-12pc.
How many households could be impacted?
As many as 20,000 mortgages of struggling homeowners will be affected, with the move potentially leaving vulnerable borrowers at the mercy of global private equity funds and distressed debt investors.
- Read more: PTSB to sell €4bn of non-performing loans
Will other banks follow suit?
The move by PTSB paves the way for other banks, such as part-nationalised AIB to follow suit.
Did the Government know about the decision?
It is understood that the Government was aware of this politically sensitive loan sale ahead of its formal launch by the bank yesterday.
Sources told the Irish Independent yesterday that Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe had warned Cabinet colleagues to expect a major story relating to a bank selling off loans to break in the coming days.
Who is expected to buy the loans?
A number of private equity firms, investment banks, and domestic lenders are shifting through the assets, with Bank of Ireland understood to be among the long list of potential suitors.

WINNIPEG, March 15 (MarketsFarm) – Routine business and crusher activity are supporting increases on the ICE canola futures midday Friday, said a Winnipeg-based trader.
“We’re off those lows certainly by a fair chunk, but we’re still below yesterday’s high,” he said, noting the funds are maxed out with their large short positions.
He also pointed to farmers, who have been quite reluctant to sell their canola, as they wait for better prices.
The soy complex on the Chicago Board of Trade was up midday Thursday, providing some support.
The Canadian dollar slipped under 75 U.S. cents.
There has been nothing new out of China regarding Richardson International. Chinese officials have yet to provide any evidence of Richardson’s canola shipments being contaminated.
Although trade negotiations between the United States and China have slowed, progress is still being made. U.S. President Donald Trump stated the next three to four weeks will determine whether negotiators come to an agreement or not. It’s widely believed Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping will sign a deal by the end of April.
About 9,300 canola contracts were traded as of 10:41 CDT.
Prices in Canadian dollars per metric tonne at 10:41 CDT:

Schools roundup
- New]As the days get shorter and the weather gets cooler, the pandas are spending more time in their yards. Panda keepers sometimes get asked by the visitors why we place the bamboo and enrichment items in the places that we do when we set up the yards. The answer is simple—we make our choices with the pandas in mind. For example, we know that the pandas typically like to have something to lean against while eating bamboo, so we place the bamboo next to a log or a tree—a built in backrest! The pandas are also creatures of habit, and have preferred eating spots, where they consistently eat more bamboo than they do in other areas of the yard. Each feeding, we make sure to place bamboo and enrichment in at least one of their favorite spots. We also need to make sure that we don’t place the puzzle feeders right next to the pools, because a feeder full of soggy biscuits quickly loses its enrichment value!
Yard swapping is a form of social enrichment. Giant pandas are territorial and adults do not spend time together outside of breeding season, but they do communicate through scent marks. They make scent marks using a gland under their tails that secretes an oily substance. The smell is very interesting to giant pandas and contains information about the panda who left it. When the pandas swap yards, they have the opportunity to investigate scent marks and explore different yards. Tian Tian will sometimes spend almost an entire day smelling and scent marking a different yard, especially when he is rut, as he is now. Last Tuesday, Mei Xiang and Bei Bei swapped yards in the morning. Tian Tian noticed his new neighbor and the two spent some time looking at each other through the howdy mesh window, but Tian Tian soon wandered away. Mei Xiang had some scent marks to explore in Bei’s yard, too, as we have already seen him beginning to scent mark.
The cold weather has also brought out the playful side of the pandas. Mei Xiang had a long play session in the first snowfall of December, climbing trees and rolling down the hill in her yard. And her play sessions have continued this past week.
Tian Tian Update
Since his veterinary exam last month, Tian Tian has been receiving specially made biscuits courtesy of the Department of Nutrition Science. Veterinarians performed a preventative health exam as a precaution in November because Tian Tian had lost some weight during the spring and summer months and they wanted to take a closer look at him. They did not find anything abnormal during the exam, but Tian Tian may be showing some changes that are normal for an older bear. It’s possible that his gastro-intestinal tract is not as efficient as it once was at extracting energy out of what he eats. The good news is that Tian Tian’s weight held steady in November and increased in December. He now weighs 266 pounds (120.8 kilos).
Our clinical nutritionists created the special biscuit recipe to supplement Tian Tian’s usual diet of bamboo, leaf-eater biscuits and fresh produce. This new biscuit is made from regular leaf-eater biscuits, two other high-fiber biscuits and beet pulp. Beet pulp is a great source of fiber. After weighing and mixing the biscuit “dough,” nutritionists chill the mixture, shape the dough into small biscuits by hand, and dry them in a special oven overnight. The following day, they are delivered to Tian Tian who eagerly eats his special biscuits along with the rest of his food. Nutritionists tried three different recipes before arriving at the current recipe, which offers the right balance of taste and nutrition.
Tian Tian is receiving about one pound (500 grams) of the special biscuits each day, and he will continue to get them until his weight returns to a more normal range for him. He may no longer need them when he starts eating bamboo culm (stalk) instead of leaves. Giant pandas eat the culm in the winter months and leaves in the warmer months, but Tian Tian has not made that transition quite yet. The biscuits have not replaced any of his normal diet. He is still eating bamboo, regular leaf-eater biscuits and produce.
The biscuit-making process is labor-intensive, so our nutritionists have enlisted the help of animal care staff from around the Zoo and volunteers with Friends of the National Zoo. The entire process can look very similar to a holiday cookie assembly line!
Bei Bei Update
Veterinarians have a better idea of what may have caused Bei Bei’s mucous stools last month. While Bei Bei’s initial laboratory results from his veterinary exam were fairly normal, a culture of his stool later indicated that he had an overgrowth of bacteria that can contribute to gastro-intestinal upset—essentially an upset stomach. After treatment, he has returned to normal and is doing well.Wouldn your income, but caution must be taken to ensure the underlying municipality is not in dire financial condition.

The bill would have allowed wagers in the city of Deadwood, and had passed a Senate Affairs Committee with a 5-4 vote last month. This week though, the South Dakota House State Affairs Committee voted against the bill though, taking it down with a vote of 7-3. The bill would normally be considered dead, but a procedural move by the House gave the measure new life, as it will now be debated and voted on by the whole house.
The idea of legalized sportsbetting is supported by residents in the Mount Rushmore State, and if the measure doesn't make it out of the house, a petition will be made to put the measure on ballots for the 2020 election. It may come to a vote from residents, as Governor Kristi Noem is against sportsbetting, and is likely to veto any bill that comes to her desk.
We'll be following this story and will update readers as the story develops.
Well, it seems like sportbetting will be legalized in South Dakota sooner or later even if the decision have to come to the vote from the residents in 2020..too bad the locals would have to wait another year or so for that.

First let’s get an idea of the roulette table variations. zeroes (0, 00).
American roulette table
As you can see the American roulette table is like the European with the main difference being the additional double zero (00). Although American roulette has one extra number (double zero), the payouts are the same as in the European version. This means that the player who plays American has a bigger disadvantage (-5,4%) versus the European game (-2,7%) because he plays against more numbers/possibilities and his probability of win is a bit lower.
French roulette table
In the image above you can see that the French roulette table has a different layout for the bets. Maybe the biggest difference is that the place for the dozen bets is the lower left and right parts of the table (see: P12, M12, D12). P12 is the bet for the first dozen numbers (1-12). M12 is the bet for the second dozen numbers (13-24) and D12 is the bet for the third dozen numbers (25-36).
Payout wise the French roulette is the same as the European roulette, since it only has one zero and 37 numbers in total. In some casinos French roulette can be even more advantageous for the player than the European type. Some French roulette games offer one of the two following rules, which partially protect the player when “zero” (0) comes:
- La Partage rule: The player loses only half his bet when he has bet Red, Black, High, Low, Odd or Even (Even Chance Bets) and zero (0) has come.
- En prison rule: The player bet stays intact when he has bet Red, Black, High, Low, Odd or Even (Even Chance Bets) and zero (0) has come. The outcome of the next spin will decide if the player wins or loses the bet.
Due to these rules, some French roulette games offer only -1,4% disadvantage when the players bets on Red, Black, High, Low, Odd or Even; these bets are also called Even or Simple Chance betsbecause the pay out as much as you have bet and have nearly 50% chance of winning.
Best and Worse Roulette Bets
The truth is that in general almost all bets in the roulette table are equal in terms of Average Expectation or simply put Risk/Reward ratio. Keep in mind however these small differentiations:
- Single zero roulette is less disadvantageous for the player than European roulette: -2,7% versus -5,4%
- French roulette with special rules can be better than European, if the player bets Red, Black, High, Low, Odd or Even: -1,4% versus 2,7%.
There is however one worst wager one can make in roulette. This bet is exclusive to American roulette and is called “Top line bet“. That is betting on 0, 00, 1, 2, 3. For this wager the player disadvantage in American roulette explodes from -5,6% to an unplayable -7,9%. This is because the casino pays you 6 times your money instead of 6,2 times your money, which is already bad enough with -5,6% disadvantage. Basically you wager 5 numbers for the price of six.

At Sports Direct’s AGM last year, investors called for a substantial strengthening of the non-executive members of the scandal-hit retailer’s board. Non-executive directors (NEDs) only seem to make headlines when scandal is afoot – either criticised as ineffective yes-men or called in as white knights to save the day. Away from the headlines the reality is much less dramatic NEDs (known in the US as Independent Directors) play an important and varied role in businesses large and small.
Here Professor Ruth Bender, leader of Cranfield School of Management’s NED Seminar, offers a useful insight into what the role entails both for companies employing NEDs and for executives interested in the role:
The role of the non-executive director (NED) has become increasingly important in organizations over the past 20 years. Although the UK Corporate Governance Code assumes that all listed companies will have NEDs, they also feature on the boards of a lot of smaller businesses, as well as most not-for-profits, and many government organizations.
Independent NEDs can provide a useful sounding board for the organization’s executives; can act as a bridge to the outside world, linking to valuable resources and making useful contacts; and can act to improve governance. Generally, their role in larger organizations is mostly a ‘monitoring’ one, acting to ensure confirmation to appropriate governance practices, whilst in smaller organizations they have a much larger role in strategy and performance.
Any organization employing a NED needs to set out clearly the objectives in so-doing, to ensure that the right individuals are attracted to the role, and that the final appointment is appropriate. Are you seeking a specific talent to strengthen the board, for example in marketing or exporting? Is it more of a general appointment? Or is there a need to improve the standard of governance, for example, prior to a fundraising or float?
Likewise, an individual offered an NED position should be very clear about why they are the right person for the job. They should also do considerable due diligence about what that job will actually entail – from basics such as the meeting requirements, through to understanding the culture of the organization they are joining, who else is on the board, and how operations are conducted. Many checklists exist to help prospective NEDs with such due diligence.
The NED role is very different to being an executive, and it can be quite a culture shock for an active executive to move into this position. Your role is to advise rather than to execute, and this can be a challenge for some personality types. NEDs also have to get used to the fact that they no longer have access to all of the information in the organization and to all of the employees – in most organizations, the NED’s information comes through the executives, and it can sometimes be a challenge to work out what you need, and how to obtain it. Any new NED should be prepared to spend quite a bit of time making contacts throughout the organization – a good and well-structured induction period is important.
Executives who want to become NEDs should appreciate that it can be difficult to obtain their first role – as with many jobs, the best qualification for recruitment seems to be having a similar job to start with. You should be prepared to network a lot, and to accept roles that are not exactly what you were seeking, just to get the term ‘NED’ onto your CV.
Transforming knowledge into action through the unique Cranfield Experience
UBC Sauder’s James Tansey and Justin Bull discuss sustainable business models, innovation, and the circular economy in conversation with IEDPGlaxoSmithKline’s decision to appoint Emma Walmsley as chief executive is a clear commitment to past strategy but an acknowledgement that a fresh, and arguably more commercially astute, approach is required to return the company to growth.
Walmsley represents an insider with an established internal track record of success and an understanding of how to get things done, but with a valuable external point of view on the weaknesses of the pharmaceuticals business gained through experiences at L’Oreal and latterly as the leader of GSK’s consumer healthcare division where she has been since 2010.
The choice of an insider signals renewed commitment to the volume-first growth strategy launched by GSK in 2015, a plan borne out of a belief that the current sky-high pricing model in pharmaceuticals is unsustainable in the long run. Industry analysts and investors were initially critical, especially given GSK’s recent performance, but the mood has warmed to the notion that large volume sales in vaccines and over the counter (OTC) products offer an attractive revenue cushion to the more risk-reward pharma division.
Walmsley brings a proven track record of delivering tremendous volume growth in global businesses. She is a seasoned marketer and consumer operator, with an emphasis on emerging markets: her legacy of achievement must be the core reason for her appointment.
Her turn around of the consumer health business unit based on strong marketing and a focus on accountability indicates a more commercially-focused approach for the company as a whole. The OTC business, traditionally seen as a stable revenue-generator, has now been placed at the core of Britain’s largest drug maker.
However, reshaping a pharmaceuticals business in the mold of consumer health will require substantial cultural shifts – this is often the hardest part of an organization to change and will be a challenge.
An interesting parallel to Walmsley’s appointment is Joseph Jimenez’s move from senior executive at H.J. Heinz Company to head of the consumer health business at Novartis, making his way to CEO a short time later.
Jimenez’s success may have set a precedent for industry outsiders with experience in consumer goods to run Big Pharma companies. Consumer marketing is always about the customer, and executives from this arena tend to have an external, ‘big picture’ mindset – a useful thing in pharma.
Many might consider the steep learning curve of the R&D space that lies ahead of Walmsley to be too risky, but she has been on the executive team since 2011 and will have picked up a significant amount through exposure to executives from the pharma business.
The Board obviously believes that the pros outweigh the cons. One risk of this appointment is that Walmsley may continue to operate too much in the sphere of her old job, giving attention to the consumer healthcare and related vaccines business. However, the future for GSK looks bright if she can manage to bring her relentless external, customer and service focus to the pharma business.
At this stage, appointing an ‘inside-outsider’ looks like a shrewd move for GSK.

We employ specialist PE teachers and sports coaches (including two GB gymnastics coaches and an LTA tennis coach) and all children from Year 1 to Year 6 receive at least 2 hours of specialist coaching per week. Our PE provision includes Cricket, Football, Rugby, Netball, Athletics, Dance, Gymnastics and Swimming, as well as general fitness and multi-skills coaching.
Curriculum
Our curriculum has been created by our Specialists to enhance the speed at which children are able to learn the basic skills to become proficient in each of our specialisms.
In Key Stage One each child is exposed to the basic skills in:
OUTDOOR
Multi Skills (Teamwork, Catching, Throwing, Tactics)
Cricket (Catching, Throwing, Grips, Bowling & Batting)
Football (Kicking, Running, Dribbling, Balance)
Athletics (Balance, Jumping, Skipping, Distance and Sprint Runs)
Netball (Catching, Throwing, Footwork, Shooting)
INDOOR
Dance (Copying, selecting, remembering and repeating sequences of movements. Developing to responding imaginatively to a variety of stimuli demonstrating a wide range of actions with precision, control and fluency. Exploring body, action, space, time and energy individually, with a partner and in small groups).
Gymnastics (children explore the basic foundations of gymnastics- starting with basic motor skills- walking, hopping, jumping, gymnastics shapes, direction and travelling. Children are given confidence to try new things with their bodies and understand key words to go with actions, such as ‘posture’ ‘flex’ ‘point’ and ‘stretch’ They then begin a journey of rolling, inversion.
Key Stage Two has a greater focus on match preparation, gymnastics routine and dance performance. Key Stage Two children take PE on Clapham Common once a week and have been allocated a 1.5 hour slot for this. During the course of Key Stage Two, children will partake in Outdoor & Adventurous Activities, Football, Netball, Rugby, Athletics and Cricket. Swimming is taught at Latchmere Leisure Centre to all pupils in Year 4 and each class is allocated 10 weeks of tuition from external swimming coaches.
Assessment
All our children are assessed against bespoke criteria that each Specialist has created for their subject. These assessments are then translated into more traditional Levels that can be recorded and tracked to ensure each child is making excellent progress and achieves the highest attainment targets we can set them.
Resources
We have excellent PE resources. Recently our generous PTA paid for upgraded PE equipment which allows us to expand the skills of all 120 children in a year group within a single lesson.
Before and After School provision
Our Specialists also offer an extensive range of Before and After school clubs which you can find out about on our Clubs pages.
Recognition
We are immensely proud of our school's sporting acheivements, which you can find out about on our Sports pages. This includes success in many inter-school competitions (locally and nationally) as well as County Age Group Caps from varying sporting bodies.
We were also delighted to be asked by the Department for Education to run a Primary P.E. Specialist Initial Teacher Training programme from 2013 to 2015. Belleville was the only primary school in the country chosen to lead the new initiative, as part of the Government’s drive to improve the quality of P.E. in primary schools and in connection with the 2012 Olympic Legacy Programme.You Could Have Money Waiting For You And Not Know It
New York Comptroller Thomas P. DiNapoli said his favorite part of the job is "return forgotten money to its rightful owners". This money could be from forgotten savings accounts, lost pay checks or inactive accounts that have been turned over to the state. In a video on the Office of the New York Comptroller's website DiNapoli states that each day his office returns over million dollars in unclaimed funds to individuals, businesses and organizations. The Comptrollers website says their is $15 Billion in unclaimed funds and already in 2018 they've returned $13,043,690.
The Office of the New York State Comptroller has made it pretty easy to see if their are any unclaimed funds in your name. It's simple search by your name or organization. If you see your name in the database you can then submit a claim to receive your unclaimed funds.
Here's how the unclaimed funds breakdown in WNY:

When a court makes a custody arrangement, the terms will not be changed unless there is a good reason to make the adjustment. If you believe your ex is not providing proper care for the child, this could constitute a good reason. Much will depend on what you can prove and what the court believes is in the best interests of the child.
Changing a Child Custody Arrangement
A custody arrangement that is in place cannot be changed unless:
- Both parties agree to the change;
- The court believes that it is in the best interests of the child to make a change.
If your ex does not agree to modifying the child custody arrangement, this means you will need to convince a court that the arrangement you have now is not working and/or is not right for your kids.
Presenting Your Case
Every state has different rules regarding when and why it will amend a child custody arrangement. As a general matter, however:
- There is generally a waiting period after the first custody arrangement is made, during which time the court will not alter the custody agreement unless there is evidence to indicate the child is in danger of harm. This waiting period may range from a few months to two years after the agreement is formed. If you do not believe the child is actually in danger or being harmed by being dropped off at your ex's mothers, then you won't be able to get the custody order changed during this time.
- A change will generally only be made if the court believes that there has been a material change in circumstances or that the current arrangement is not what is best for the child.
For example, if your ex is dropping off your child at his mothers every day from early morning to 10 PM, this does not necessarily mean that it is dangerous for the child to visit him. It also isn't necessarily a bad thing, since this allows the child to spend time with his or her grandmother. However, if your spouse is not supervising your child and is keeping her up until 10 PM, this may indicate a problem that could convince the court the child custody arrangement isn't working.I configured my Yahoo Mail ID in Outlook Express and received my mail in Outlook’s inbox.

Music and production by Nicholas Lloyd-KuzikTricia Springstubb, author are thought-provoking, serious, and laugh-out-loud funny. I wanted all of us to know more about this intriguing author.
“She thought she knew everything there was to know about herself and Sylvie, but now she thinks maybe the real trick of seeing, the kind of seeing humans could really use, is the kind that lets you see through someone else’s eyes.”
—Moonpenny Island
“Hating someone becomes a habit as sure as loving him does. Letting go of a feeling, even a terrible one—it’s hard. It hurts.”
—Moonpenny Island
“The heck of it is, Flor? No two people see eye to eye on what happy is.”
—Moonpenny Island
Is it easy for you to remember specific feelings and details from your own childhood?
I think we’re all nesting dolls, with our earlier selves tucked away inside. I’m lucky that my childhood doll is easy to bring to light—not so much specific events or details, but how intensely I felt everything, everything, during those years. Fear, love, shyness, the desire to make my mother proud, the pleasures and confusions of friendship—it’s all waiting for me to pull out and hold in my hand.
What were your favorite books to read when you were growing up?
When kids ask me that I beg off, because I’m terrible at “favorite” questions! I was an omnivore reader—comics, mysteries, biographies of saints. I only wish I still read as widely as I did then. I remember loving, and being terrified by, Hans Christian Anderson. I read “Pippi Longstocking” over and over. It’s always fun to tell an audience of kids how I adored Nancy Drew—there are always eager nods of agreement. She’s still such a wonderful character and role model.
How old were you when you first determined you would write books? Were you always going to write books for children?
I’m still surprised to be a writer of any sort. Much as I loved books growing up, I never thought about how they came to be. They just were, like trees and rivers and birds. It wasn’t till my late 20’s that I slowly morphed from reader to writer.
Which of your earlier career experiences do you feel inform your writing?
Every job I’ve ever had (not counting waitressing) was with children. I worked in Head Start, in a group home for adolescents, in the children’s room of a public library. Kids are my people. Each experience I have with them teaches me something, and when I’m lucky, I translate what I learn into stories.
Your stories are set in neighborhoods where people know each other and rely on one another. Has this been your own experience?
Sense of place is so important to my work. I grew up in a subdivision where all the houses were exactly alike and we kids ran in and out of each other’s kitchens and bathrooms and yards all day long. My husband and I raised our three daughters in an inner ring suburb much like Cody’s, where people look out for each other. So I love this kind of small, sheltering community. Yet I’m also interested, in books like Moonpenny Island and Every Single Second, in exploring the pressures that work against insularity. I’m about mirrors, but also wide-open windows.
Your stories range from the very funny Cody, who’s just right for second and third graders, to the quite serious tale of Nella, whose neighborhood is altered forever by an accidental shooting that may be racially motivated. As a writer, how do you switch between the lighthearted tone of the Cody chapter books and the more intense tone of Every Single Second?
I began writing the Cody books as a kind of antidote to my more heavy-duty novels. I really appreciate you finding them funny—I so value funny! Cody copes with many of the same issues my older characters do, including getting along with her family and friends, and trying to understand the difference between wrong and right and then to act on it. She’s also hugely empathetic, with people and animals (including baby skunks and Madagascar hissing cockroaches). But I do keep things light and fun, and this is just another side of me as both a person and a writer.
Your Cody books (there are three now) are a series. Did you write the first one (Cody and the Fountain of Happiness) and then determine with your editor that these would become a series or did you set out to create a character who could sustain a series?
I wrote the first book with fingers crossed it would be a series. I knew Cody and Spencer had lots more stories to tell! Liz Bicknell at Candlewick gave me a two-book contract and then (hooray!) extended it to four.
How do you develop the plots of the different books in a series?
I had an idea to write one book for each of the seasons. And I wanted the last book (coming spring 2018) to have some sense of closure. But other than that—I don’t know! The characters just lead me on.
Fathers are pivotal characters in your books.
- In the Cody books, her father is an over-the-road trucker. His homecomings are very important to the plot because he often provides good counsel.
- In the Mo Wren books, Mo’s mother died in an accident. Her father is dealing with grief and starting life over.
- In Every Single Second, the father has a secret that plays a pivotal role in Nella’s coming to terms with her changing world.
- In Moonpenny Island, when Flor’s mother takes an extended leave from the family to find herself, Flor’s father, the island’s police officer, is left to manage.
I think your books are refreshing with this prominence of fathers. Have you thought about why the fathers are in your stories?
I’m always afraid when I submit a new manuscript that my editor will say, Here we go again—another father book! My relationship with my own father was complicated and not always happy. When I was small, he was my super-hero. As I grew up, I never doubted that he loved me and my siblings, but he wasn’t always the father I longed for and needed. Now, in hindsight, I can see the pain he must have been in himself, but I still clearly remember how confusing it was to realize he wasn’t, after all, perfect, that he had his own weaknesses. I think all kids go through some version of this in the tween years (not Cody, not yet!) and maybe it’s even more complicated for daughters than sons. That complexity, that mixture of love and regret and growing self-reliance, is something I keep exploring.
Your language is often poetic, with phrases that capture the reader’s imagination, pausing for a moment to consider the images that you evoke. Do you collect words and phrases to draw from? Do you read poetry?
Thank you! Language is so important to me. My work is very sentence-y. I hope to make every line count. I naturally reach for similes and metaphors: it’s my way of trying to connect our inner and outer lives. I do read poetry—but I’m always resolving to read more of it!
There are always a fully developed set of neighborhood characters in your books, dependable because they have such intriguing stories of their own. How do you develop these supporting characters? Do you keep a notebook full of interesting people and then find them good homes in your books?
I do keep notebooks! But writing minor characters is easy for me. The tricky part is not getting too interested in them, so they attempt to stage a coup and become major characters. In my first drafts, I’m always trying to balance what I think should happen with the zillion other possibilities. I’m the boss of this universe, after all! That said, in my current work in progress, a new character has just appeared, literally standing in the middle of the road. I have the feeling he’s not budging.
Cody’s mother is Head of Shoes at a department store. Cody often remarks on her mother’s outfit and her shoes. Your illustrator, Eliza Wheeler, often draws the mother in her stylin’ finery. Where does this fashion statement come from?
I’m so not a fashion icon (ask my daughters)! But a great part of the fun of writing is creating characters you’ll never be. I love thinking up Mom’s glam outfits. And Eliza’s illustrations are so delectable!
from Cody and the Rules of Life, illus copyright Eliza Wheeler
Another important aspect of your books is that each main character has a brother or sister, older or younger, with whom they bicker but ultimately love deeply, showing that love in their actions and thoughts. Your characters, although their worlds are changing around them, never feel isolated because they have a sibling to love. Why is this important to you in building your stories?
I come from a big family—two brothers and two sisters. My siblings were constant sources of annoyance, envy, and outright fury, but what would I ever have done without them? There’s something about sharing a nest that stays with you the rest of your life. Nothing makes me happier than listening to my three grown daughters, who drove each other crazy growing up and are best friends now, share childhood stories. In my work in progress, my main character is an only child, and she’s fine with that. I’m really enjoying writing her and exploring what other kinds of connections she makes with the world.
Can you share with us which books we can look forward to next?
Next April the last Cody book, Cody and the Heart of a Champion, will publish. I’ve got a picture book (hardest thing for me to write) in the works, and a new middle grade novel that I’ve just torn completely to pieces and started over. I’d also love to write a book with a boy as a main character, something I’ve yet to pull off. As Stevenson wrote, “The world is so full of a number of things, I’m sure we should all be as happy as kings.”

Cubała WJ., Godlewska B., Trzonkowski P., Landowski J.
The aetiology of depression remains tentative. Current hypotheses on the aetiology of the depressive disorder tend to integrate monoaminoergic, neuroendocrine and immunological concepts of depression. A number of research papers emphasise the altered hormonal and immune status of patients with depression with pronounced cytokine level variations. Those studies tend to link the variable course of depression in relation to the altered proinflammatory activity of the immune system. The results of the studies on the activity of the selected elements of the immune system are ambiguous indicating both increased and decreased activities of its selected elements. However, a number of basic and psychopharmacological studies support the hypothesis of the increased proinflammatory activity of the immune system in the course of depression which is the foundation for the immunological hypothesis of depression. The aim of this paper is to review the functional abnormalities that are observed in depression focusing on the monoaminoergic deficiency and increased immune activation as well as endocrine dysregulation. This paper puts together and discusses current studies related to this subject with a detailed insight into interactions involving nervous, endocrine and immune systems.Top 5 Reasons why to fix your website SEO?
By now I'm sure that most of the website owners know a lot about SEO, or maybe they
know only what it stands for, at least they heard the term!
But just in case, SEO stands for "Search Engine Optimization" and in short it's the adjustments that you do to your web pages and web pages content along with the tactics that you do all over the internet to make sure that your website will be seen more often and on top of the search results on specific word or phrase.
You can learn more about SEO by checking our blog What is SEO? And How it works?
So what are the top 5 reasons you may wonder that we think it's the most important for you, my favorite is the 3ed one.
1. Build your brand:
Let's say that you are searching for something, "Pizza" for example, what is the
first result you get? in my case 1st was "Pizza Hut" and the 2nd was "Dominos"
nothing I didn't expect actually, for me both well-known names. But is the real
indicator what if your Pizza shop name was the 3rd? I would say it must be a big,
well known, international brand to be next after those guys!
A good SEO will help you score this idea in the mind of searchers. When you show in the 2nd or 3rd page in search results, your brand image will most probably be "this is a new brand", "this is a small local thing" or even worst "this is not a high-quality brand" you don't want that.
2. You are not paying for ads here:
Think of the old days. You need to put your name in the newspaper or the magazines
to get the people attending, and if you have maybe a bigger budget you may go to a
radio or TV ads.
This approach has 2 major issues, you are paying a lot to show for a limited number of people in a very limited time, a day in the newspaper case, a week or a month in it's best in the magazine case and for 30 seconds up to a couple of minutes max.
Fixing your website SEO will help you avoid these issues, your link will be there as long as it's on your website for everyone searching for you, your services, or one of your keywords.
3. Higher chances of deal closing rates:
The target of having an online store is to go from search to website, check a product,
add it to cart and move to check out.
So let's say you have a glasses online store, and you are using a keyword like "best medical glasses frames" as one of your key phrases. Your chances are higher to get the order completed for one of your medical glasses frame are way better than the case having the word "best glasses" a lot of people will be searching for "cups" and they will bounce Back as soon as they figure out that your "glasses" are not the one that they can drink with, it's the one that you wear.
4. Ranking on local searches increases visits and sales:
It was the end of a long working day, and I was in the mode for a hot and spicy
pepperoni pizza, opened a new tab in my browser and searched "Pizza near me". In no
time Google did the magic and came back to me with the tasty results you have a shop
in 500 m and another one in 350m the funny part was the first result was not the
nearest, nor the more known for me! it was Tino's Pizza Cafe!! Not Dominos which was
the 2nd result!!
According to Google, 50% of consumers who performed a local search on a mobile device visited a store on that same day and leads to higher sales, 18% higher to be more specific and this is within the same day of the search.
Try to use our SEO in 30 days task list to fix your website.
5. More traffic for better-optimized websites:
No need to explain more, the title is saying it all. Anyway, I left this to the last
not that it's the least important but actually cause it's the most obvious. Still,
one point to lifesize on, why do we search for better ranking and more traffic online
for our websites? Well, this is very much related to point number 3, more people reach
your website/page, the more chances you have to get an order.
Let's say that you get 5-10% of the visitors to buy one of your products, and you are getting 1000 visits per month, that is 50-100 sales. What if you fixed your SEO to the point you start getting 10K - 20K visits? Yap your sales should go up to 500-2000 sales.
In the end, 1 last tip, "Be patient". Fixing SEO will take time to give results.

April 5, 2009
Hang on for a minute...we're trying to find some more stories you might like.
After a season-best fourth place finish at the FAU Spring Break Championship, Northwestern is motivated to be one of the hottest teams going into the final round of play at the Wyoming Cowboy Classic in Scottsdale, Ariz.
Despite their recent success, coach Pat Goss is not yet satisfied. Although the Cats are ranked high enough to qualify for the NCAA Championships, Goss said the team is still six wins below .500.
The Cats have two regular season meets and the Big Ten Championships to surpass the mark. With so many other teams competing at the tournament, Goss said the goal is attainable this week.
“Hopefully we can play well and pick up a lot of wins,” Goss said.
The Cats’ biggest competitor is two-time defending tournament champion UC Davis. The Aggies are ranked 36th in the nation, 22 spots above the Cats.
After finishing a career-best second place at the FAU Spring Break Championship, all eyes are on junior Jonathan Bowers.
“It will be very important for us to see how Jon Bowers responds after having such a great week last week,” Goss said.
Bowers played in the fourth spot on the team last weekend, but finished in the first spot overall. Usual frontrunners – junior David Lipsky and freshman Eric Chun – did not compete well last weekend. But Goss said he hopes Bowers’ success will right their uneven games in Arizona.
“In college golf, they build off of that internal competition,” Goss said. “At times, it can get complicated because they are jockeying against each other for who is going to travel, but at the same time trying to be supportive teammates. Hopefully, with more of that internal competition, we can get rid of some of that inconsistency.”
Bowers has been working on putting together both his short and long games for an overall package. Since only five of the eight NU golfers travel and just four scores count toward the team total, playing the best at all times is crucial.
“It just goes to show you that you never know who is going to show up for each tournament,” Bowers said. “I played the number four spot last weekend but came out on top. That to me says that any one of the guys on our team has the ability to do really well. It’s just who shows up on that day.”
Following a week of cold and windy weather that forced the Cats to work on their short game indoors, Goss said his team’s biggest challenge will be adjusting to the desert climate.
“We’ve been practicing decently this week, but it gets tricky this time of year. It was nice to get out here and actually practice,” Goss said.
In addition to Bowers’ play, senior Andy DeKeuster’s 25th overall finish and leadership on the course kept the Cats positive down the stretch. DeKeuster said he wants the team to keep the momentum up from last week’s season-best finish and individual achievements.
“This week is one of our last three regular season tournaments before Big Tens,” DeKeuster said. “We hope it’s just going to push us one step closer to our goal.”

The idea was to make an inventory of resources available in the village. Post 'nuclear threat' this had been put on the back burner. Six districts and county work together. County now had Civil Protection Department. There was no full time officer in any district. There was a single point of contact paging system in the county. For example emergency services would page Tony Leadley if they needed his assistance. He would then contact other relevant people. He gets on average three calls a week. In any major incident police would take control. Parish council is not in front line. There was no need any longer for parish emergency plan BUT parish council should nominate someone with local knowledge for TL to contact if necessary. AGREED - point of contact to be clerk (with local knowledge and general overview of facilities) - chairman and vice chairman to be back up. As the community centre was the likely rest/evacuation centre for the village the issue of whether MCC, in the event of a power failure, should have a back up generator was raised. 140/99 Dog Bins (574/98) The dog bins had all been installed. SCDC had been asked to empty each bin only as it would cost £1.50 per bin to replace with bags.

Our comments were being passed to the Highways Agency. 142/99 Landfill Site - East Waste (85/99) Cover was applied to the site daily a small area being worked at a time and sealed quickly with green waste and soils. Reports of litter blow and/or odour should be made to East Waste (phone Paul Farrington 0780 681190 or 01223 860955 or Clive Carr 07771 891951). Planning permission required the site to be restored to agricultural use. Some limited tree planting had taken place but general tree planting would not be allowed because of possible damage by roots to the clay capping (letter from County Council). Members recollected a promise that the land could be used for recreational use. The clerk: to investigate. 143/99 Public Entertainments Licences (104/99) The licences for the Waggon & Horses and White Horse had been granted with conditions: Maximum of two entertainments per month on Fridays and Saturdays, the Waggon & Horses' licence being for a period of six months.

If we ever wish to turn any other road into a "Consent Street" we need to ask SCDC. 145/99 Industrial Estate (127/99) Paul Quigley SCDC had indicated that the old A10 would be cleaned of litter as part of the litter cleaning contract. The clerk had asked Herald Contract Services to cut the verge as part of his contract. JEC proposed that the industrial estate road should be named after a tree - not seconded. AGREED (by 12 votes to 2) to ask SCDC to name the road Doggett Way - after a former owner of the land. 4. Planning 146/99 The minutes of the Planning Committee meeting of 22 March 1999 were received. Decisions received 147/99 East Waste - variation of conditions - approved. (52/99) New Applications 148/99 S/0415/99/A The White Horse - signs - Sign G deleted - noted.

Today, businesses and individual potential customers look up the internet before they decide to deal with you. Everyone desires to make sure that they are dealing with genuine people. This is the reason why the reputation of your online business must be protected.
Research studies have reported that 80% of clients are persuaded by suggestions displayed on social platform regarding products and services, and only 14% believe in advertisements. Internet has fetched plenty of freedom for spreading of information instantly and globally. Those people having grudges can be heard all around the world, without media getting involved. Issues regarding brands are taken notice of not just in your own market niche, but also across the country.
Media stories may not be always true, but remember false information spread faster than truth, which has the potential to damage your brand reputation. From a purely financial viewpoint, good reputation assists you in getting more clients which will help you in making money and growing influence. It is something tangible, to be proud of and feel good.
Online business either small or big needs to get recognition far and wide. So many businesses are applying online reputation management strategies to protect their brand name. This aspect needs to be considered closely, assuming that you may have heard or read about reputation issues. When users search your name, they will be presented with your entire data, but are you sure about the accuracy of such representations? Does it accurately say who and what you are? Is that information obsolete? Are you regarded with the same credibility as your peers? How does their status weigh against yours?
These days, a recording of stupidity on smartphones can hang around incessantly on the net. For example, if an employee can get careless, say something wrong, the recording will be visible on search engines ceaselessly. If you are building a reputation either personally or related to your business, then you will need to involve in taking care of it and protecting it, if necessary.
Important steps to monitor as well as defend your brand and reputation
- Step1 – Gain knowledge on how social media podiums work. Understand how to use popular media like FaceBook, YouTube, Twitter and MySpace. Get familiar with these platforms by reading their terms and conditions. Take some time to watch and recognize how people are making use of these social media channels.
- Step2 – Social media has not just thousands but millions of users, so do not assume that it will not damage your name. Users might comprise of your clients, who are columnists, public figures, influencers, and bloggers. These people are tweeting about companies. Maybe about yours? It becomes necessary to find out if their chat is positive or negative for you or your business.
- Step3 – Be proactive to defend your trademark. You can do this in several ways. First register your trade name with different social media channels. In this manner, your brand is saved from getting skyjacked by an unknown person.
- Step4 – Create a plan for your company that notifies and educates the staff. The company policy will have guidelines of how to use social media – what to say and what not to discuss, when it is about the company. In addition, the company policy must include a backup plan to follow, especially in case of crisis.
- Step5 – Be alert. Monitor social platforms regularly. Ignorance is not forgiven. It is vital to know, when someone is chatting about you and your brand – Be it good, bad or ugly.
- Step6 – Sometimes things written about you or your business may be negative but embrace it, when considered necessary. The social media platforms are the places where discussions regarding the situation are done in public, so be willing to accept the negative conversations. It will give you better integrity with other clients.
Free monitoring tools:
- Google Alerts – Google alerts you, when you come in search, or if your brand is mentioned on Google News, Videos, Search engines, and Groups.
- Twitter – Search tool available on Twitter displays, what is tweeted that resembles your search inquiry.
- Monitor This – Monitor-This keeps watch on more than 20 search engine feeds.
- Technorati – This tool notifies if your brand is mentioned in Blogosphere.
Social media offers plenty of marketing benefits like creating awareness and testimonials. However, it is necessary to remain cautious towards your reputation and trademark. If you do not have the time, then consider outsourcing the job before deceptive activities actually wipe away your marketing investments – corrodes the brand and reputation as well as ruptures your customer trust.

Are you wondering what that even means? Well this post should clarify things and get you on your way to doing an awesome property inspection.
What is a Property Inspection?
A Property inspection can mean different things to different people. If we were Realturds, then we would refer to this as a 4 hour drill down on the property, searching every nook and cranny for ANYTHING that could possible be wrong with the house. I like to think of that type of inspection a deal killer. That’s not what OUR property inspections are.
In the eyes of a real estate wholesaler, a property inspection is an in person meeting where you do a walk through of the property, checking out some important facts and taking LOT of photos (even a video if you’re on top of it).
Your property inspection should last about 15-30 minutes. If the seller is there with you, then asking questions about updates/repairs to the house will be helpful. They can offer a lot of insight bout the age of roof, air conditioning, plumbing, additions that were done without permits, foundation issues, driveway cracks and more!
When is a Property Inspection Needed?
This is where alot of people fail miserably. Some real estate investors never do a property inspection! HOW CAN YOU MAKE AN INTELLIGENT OFFER WITHOUT SEEING THE HOUSE? The answer is:
As a wholesaler, your job is to provide deals with enough equity that your cash buyer will be able to make a profit on the deal. PROFIT will come to your cash buyer once he has purchased the house, made the repairs, and then sold the house to a retail buyer. Important factor : MADE REPAIRS!
When you’re talking to sellers, they’ll tell you that the house needs some paint and carpet. You can’t believe that for a second. They have no idea what repairs might be needed to put the house in retail condition. That’s for YOU (the professional) to decide.
And that’s why you need to do a property inspection.
Related: How to Determine Property Value
How To Do A Property Inspection
You’re going to look at everything! Start with curb appeal and work your way around the entire outside and inside of the house. Keep your eyes out for any obvious repairs that are needed. Check the 4 major components of every house:
Roof : [Interior] Are there water stains on the ceiling?
Are there any existing leaks? Is there any drywall or insulation that has fallen onto the floor?
[Exterior] Are the shingle curling up on the edges? Is there a tarp on the roof?] When was the roof replaced?
NOTE: It’s common for sellers to sell the house when the roof needs replacing, because they can’t afford to replace it. (Roofs aren’t cheap and once they need replacing, it goes downhill fast).
Plumbing: What type of plumbing does the house have? Galvanized (silver pipes) is the oldest type of plumbing and needs to be replaced. Copper (gold pipes) is better than galvanized but still has issues. Could possibly need replacing depending on the age. CPVC is the best type of plumbing.
Does the seller have buckets under the sink? Be sure to check! This will indicate a plumbing leak that needs to be repaired/replaced.
Heat/Air: What is customary in your area for heat / AC? Check the system out to see if it works. In Florida, we MUST have central heating and air – and a lot of times the outside unit has been stolen. The outside unit is expensive, so you want to factor that in when calculating rehab costs.
Electrical: Check the electrical panel and see if its a 200 amp panel. If so, that’s the best choice and you wouldn’t need an electrical upgrade. Make notes on your inspection report about what you find here, and if you’re unsure if it needs replacing then consider that it DOES!
Take a ton of photos: There’s no such thing as too many photos. The photos of a property can ALMOST tell the story. So the more you take, the better your odds are of generating interest to your cash buyers.
What do you need photos of? Here’s a checklist for you:
Street view
Curb appeal
Front of the house
Back of the house
Sides of the house
- Living Room
- Kitchen (cabinets/countertops) (from several angles)
Bathrooms (from several angles)
any and ALL obvious damage that you see
Windows (not all of them but a few, especially if theyre broken or damaged)
Air conditioning unit (inside and out)
hot water heater
electrical panel

How am I Supposed to Estimate Repair Costs from a Property Inspection?
This is where you can either make the deal amazing for your buyers, or really mess it up good. It’s hard to get this perfect, because everyone does rehabs differently, and their costs to make a house beautiful will vary. Some rehabbers do “band aid” rehabs, where they just add paint and carpet to make the house presentable enough to sell to a first time homeowner. Others will replace EVERYTHING and make it a brand new home. It’s not your job to determine what your buyer will do.
I have a rule of thumb when estimating repairs and filling out my inspection sheet. If the house is in a neighborhood that has retail sales, and the comps are solid, then I’ll assume that everything will be replaced. This will bring top dollar in the back end sale for your rehab buyer.
Determining how much that will cost is a challenge for some people, especially if you’re new to the business. If you get it wrong, it could destroy your deal. Believe me, I see A LOT of people get it wrong.
I just put new floors in my house, and they were $6,000 alone. So I highly doubt that a house that is being sold at a wholesale price needs $5,000.00 . but ok…
For this reason, I’ve developed a fantastic tool called the Rehab Estimator Tool. It’s super easy to use, and it calculates a rehab estimate that is going to be pretty spot on! It’s available for use for FREE if you’re a Member of the MOB.
I took a survey from rehabbers all over the country, asking them about prices to get repairs and replacements done on their rehab jobs. I threw out all of the stupid answers (like replacing a window for $100) and created a National AVERAGE of expenses.
Then, I designed a property inspection form that anyone can use. Just by answering some “Yes” or “No” questions, the tool will calculate rehab costs in the background!
The Mobsters (Members of the MOB) have been using this tool for a couple of years, and they LOVE IT! It’s a fool proof way to estimate what it will cost to rehab a property, and lock down a solid number to use in your MAO formula.

Property Inspection Etiquette
When you arrive at the property, ask permission from the seller (or whoever meets you there) to take photos of the house. Some people get weirded out about someone taking photos.
When you’ve done your walk through and you’ve taken all of the photos that you need, thank the seller for their time and allowing you to take a look around the house!
There you have it. Now you have some general knowledge on how to do a property inspection, and why it’s important to every property that you deal with.
Look, this market is hot right now, and there’s a lot of new people entering the business trying to make a quick dollar. It’s going to be best practice for you to learn how to do things the RIGHT way, so that you have longevity. I am a believer in “fake it until you make it”, but I also know “the more you learn, the more you earn”. So take the time and learn how to be professional, accurate, and offer only the best deals there is. This will guarantee a long career in the real estate business.

Hello,
When you enter a confirmation for a service item in EBP, the account assignment fields (cost centre, GL account) are changeable. We would like to make these fields display only.
We have looked at two methods:
1. BADI BBP_UI_CONTROL_BADI. Unfortunately, the help alongside this in the IMG states that for a confirmation, the BADI does not control the fields for "interface objects of cross-application screens" which includes the account assignment screen.
2. Create a screen variant using SHD0 for the confirmations screen and make these fields read only along with the BBP_SCREENVARIANT BADI implementation. The screen is SAPLBBP_CF_200 but this screen does not have a screen variant in transaction SHD0 that we can see.
Can anyone suggest anything else or have we overlooked something in the methods above? We would prefer not to change the HTML template.

Further advances can be compared against a standard remortgage or second charge product, while ported products are displayed alongside purchases, enabling brokers to quickly identify which option is best suited to the client’s needs.
The system produces an audit trail showing the comparison of the different lending options and the product ultimately selected.
Phil Bailey, strategy director of Twenty7Tec, said: “This is the first time a sourcing system has been capable of looking at a remortgage, further advance and a secured loan, all from the same results screen and backed up with our compliant Evidence of Research document.”
He continued: “Brokers expect technology to keep up. What we have shown with this series of system enhancements, is that we listen to our users and can adapt quickly to their needs and the demands of this industry”.Faculty discussed and voted on amendments to parts of the Arts and Sciences Curriculum Committee’s proposal to change the college’s distribution requirements. Major amendments included changes to the wording of the new “human difference” distribution category and modification to the wording concerning the double-listing of courses in distribution categories on Wednesday.
The amendments will be added to the final proposal for faculty to vote online to accept or reject entirely on an unspecified date, according to Lisa Nichii, vice provost of undergraduate education.
The Arts and Sciences Curriculum Committee released its original proposal in March, which recommended reducing the language requirement from 11 credits of instruction in one language or one non-introductory course to two courses of at least three credits each in the same language or one non-introductory level course, The Sun previously reported. The proposal also recommended allowing American Sign Language to fulfill the language requirement, instituting a “human difference” requirement and reorganizing the distribution requirements.
The Sun reported in May that faculty decided to not vote on the proposal at a meeting. In June, a revised proposal was released where the language requirement was unchanged from its current form. The new version of the proposal still would allow sign language to be used to fulfill the requirement, however.
At the meeting on Wednesday, faculty discussed the proposal to require students to fulfill five out of the 10 new distribution requirements in their first four semesters at the University.
The goal is “to balance the feasibility of fitting in many different distribution courses for a student that has a very packed first couple years [like those with] with pre-med requirements and also trying make sure this exploration does happen early,” said Prof. Tom Pepinsky, government, chair of the curriculum committee.
Prof. Cynthia Chase, English, expressed concern for the student “who arrives at Cornell already knowing what she or he is especially interested in” and that there are many of those students “who are telling me they are reluctantly fulfilling a distribution requirement because it is their junior or senior year,” Chase said.
Pepinksy affirmed the change was to encourage early exploration and that “the logic behind this is to encourage students to explore beyond what they think they already came here wanting to do,” he said.
Additionally, faculty passed an amendment to change the name of the “human difference” distribution category to “social difference.”
Prof. Sandra Greene, history, voiced her disapproval on the original word choice of “human,” since it is not particularly even accurate in how it handles what is incorporated in that category,” Greene said.
Greene told those present that “a more accurate description is social difference, because it deals with class, race, ethnicity, ethnic origin: theses all are all social categories — there’s no human difference, it’s social difference,” Greene said.
Wording was clarified for the proposed change for courses being listed under two distribution categories instead of a single distribution category. The faculty voted to adopt “individual courses can be listed in up to two distribution categories” as the clarifying wording in the proposal. Pepinsky previously told The Sun that the new version of the proposal allows two of the classes students take to go towards two distribution requirements each.
Additional discussion centered around having classes fall under two distribution categories. Deborah A. Starr, Near Eastern studies, expressed approval for the chance to list courses in more than a single distribution category.
However, Starr expressed concern over the possibility of a disproportionate amount of humanities courses being double-listed over science courses.
In response to Starr’s concern, Brian Crane, chemistry, a member of the curriculum committee, said there is “lots of fusion between the scientific disciplines.”
Additionally, Crane said the proposal was driven by “practical concern.”
Crane specified the “hierarchical” nature of science curriculum makes it difficult for students to fulfill their distribution requirements, painting the image of a sophomore taking 25 credit hours in a single term to emphasize the inflexibility of the current distribution requirements.
“So without this flexibly [of double listing courses], this curriculum just becomes very difficult for some science students to do,” Crane said.
“We’re worried about student stresses,” and, “We’re not saying don’t take anything, we’re just saying there is some flexibility if you want to use it,” Crane added.
“The entire meeting went well; I think that we had a productive debate — I think we had a nice exchange of ideas, we had some important amendments that had to be passed,” Pepinsky said to The Sun after the meeting.
“I think the people who are not on the committee were generally pleased with the meeting,” Pepinsky said.8 Ways to Use an Old Wooden Ladder as Garden Art
Anytime something old can be repurposed as something useful or pretty, I get excited. I really got excited when I found these old ladders being used in a variety of ways for garden art. You may think that just because a wooden ladder has become wobbly and unsafe to climb on means it’s time to toss it. Not so!
I recently threw away an old wooden ladder and now I’m kicking myself for it. You can bet I’ll be on the lookout for another one that has outlived its usefulness as a typical ladder but can instead be turned into one of these delightful art forms.
Whether you decide to paint yours or leave it plain, you’re sure to find inspiration when look through this list of ways that old ladders can be put to new use.

If you’re charged with DUI, the best way to handle your professional career is let your lawyer handle that, because if you don’t have to tell your employer, then don’t. If you have an employment agreement, and you’re supposed to tell your employer that you were arrested or charged with a crime like a DUI, then you should abide by that agreement and tell them.

We don’t agree with the use of safety memes and other voyeuristic techniques as, although they may create awareness and get attention they can lead to desensitisation (see: A Case of Desensitisation)
Since safety seems to have a culture of its own, then it makes sense that safety memes will flood facebook, the internet and training presentations. Oh well, if you can beat em, join em. Here is a collection of safety memes and links to more. Please carefully consider what you do with these and the long term harm they may cause.

It is classified as a Doctoral Research University Extensive by the Carnegie Foundation - their highest category. With more than 250 buildings, the 2,000-acre campus is bordered on the north by shopping streets, on the east and south by University Lake and residential areas, and on the west by the Mississippi River.
The campus is noted for its many live oak and magnolia trees and an architectural style based on the Renaissance domestic style of northern Italy (tan stucco walls, red tile roofs).
Near Lockett Hall, which houses the Department of Mathematics, there are two Indian Mounds. These are ancient earthworks made by Native Americans thousands of years ago.
The 2.7-million volume Middleton Library currently subscribes to about 300 mathematics journals. Students often gather informally in the quadrangle in front of the Library.
The Department and the Library jointly provide electronic access to MathSciNet, the electronic version of Mathematical Reviews. The latest upgrade to MathSciNet Version 5.0 has been purchased. The Student Technology Fee has provided for the installation of networked clusters of personal computers in the library and in buildings across campus. Appropriate educational software is provided, including both Maple and Mathematica.
LSU's Office of Computing Services maintains the campus network,together with an IBM mainframe, an RS-6000 Unix work-station cluster available for scientific research. Recent funding from the NSF permitted LSU to become a member of Internet II, a high-speed network test-bed for interconnection of universities. Additional funding has also been obtained for a new Unix cluster, CASPAR, for research in parallelism and scientific computing.
In 2002 LSU installed a supercomputer in the form of a Beowulf cluster of 512 custom-made machines connected through a special 2-gigabit-per-second network. The cluster has a total of 1024 processors, one terabyte of RAM, and the capability of performing over two trillion operations per second. The Mathematics Department has a smaller version of the LSU supercomputer, on which to develop software compatible with the large machine. The departmental version has 32 processors and 32 gigabytes of RAM. Brush up your skills of parallel programming: you will need them to take full advantage of the new supercomputers.
The physical network in Lockett Hall has been upgraded from 10Mbps to 100Mbps CAT5 cabling. This included an upgraded link to the campus network and enhanced the department's link with Internet 2. This upgraded connection provides better communication within the University and world-wide via the Internet, and enhances electronic access to other research collaborators as well as permits access to other campus computing clusters with increased computational power.
Within the Mathematics Department, the local area Ethernet supports a heterogeneous network of Unix work-stations, Windows clients, Linux machines, and MacIntosh computers. Software supporting numerical and symbolic research projects in mathematics is readily available across the network, including Mathematica and MatLab.
Students will find excellent facilities for theater and concert activities. Many University productions, guest artists, road shows, and popular entertainers are booked each year. The city of Baton Rouge supports a symphony and an opera series in its modern river-side theater complex known as the Centroplex. In addition, the many night locales offer a wide variety of bands and vocalists, and the University sponsors a film series.
The sports facilities for intercollegiate competition and campus recreation at LSU compare favorably with those at any major university. There is an extensive intramural program, and the math department fields teams in basketball and softball. There is a large recreational sports center on campus for students' enjoyment and good health.
The city of Baton Rouge, capital of the State of Louisiana, has a metropolitan area population of more than 500,000. The city is home of the fifth largest port in the United States. Baton Rouge has many fine restaurants, while for regal entertainment and world-famous cuisine, New Orleans is only an hour and a half away via Interstate 10. Houston is five hours west of Baton Rouge.
The Louisiana countryside provides many opportunities for bicycling, picnicking, and canoeing. Well-preserved plantation homes offer interesting sightseeing. There are wildlife sanctuaries, horse-racing tracks, hunting, and fishing. Baton Rouge is located on the edge of Cajun Louisiana, where French is still spoken and cooking is a fine art practiced in many restaurants great and small.
The weather is semi-tropical. Midsummer daily maximums are generally around 92 degrees Fahrenheit, the humidity is high, and afternoon showers can be expected. These showers are usually preceded and followed by sunshine. On the other hand, winter weather usually lasts no more than a month, with daily minimums in the forties and occasional overnight freezes. Fall and spring weather last for extended periods, bringing out joggers in droves. Annual average rainfall is a moderate 54 inches. Drinking water comes from deep artesian wells which tap underground springs. The drinking water fell thousands of years ago as rain in the Blue Ridge Mountains and traveled to Baton Rouge in streams filtered by underground layers of sand and rock.
Finding an apartment in Baton Rouge is not difficult. The rent for apartments is relatively low for a large metropolitan area. Free city bus service is provided from campus to many of the areas where students frequently live. A student needs to show only a valid LSU ID card. Residence Hall accommodations are available for unmarried graduate students. The University also maintains unfurnished one- to three-bedroom apartments.

She is also a poet who has published various books of aphorisms and poems. Her background in writing and literary criticism makes her comics pretty unique and literature-oriented, and she uses texts for merely aesthetic reasons. On the other hand, she feels that her comics are more grotesque and rough than her poems. The interest for aphorisms reflects her point of view on fragments, as she thinks they correlate the way we perceive reality and speak of the density of the world. Tiina senses that in this moment in time we are losing our ability to dream and experience freely, and that imagination must be freed again. To achieve this goal she uses surreal juxtapositions in her art, as the best way to deal with the complicated nature of the being.“Become what you are”
Here is a translation of the address Benedict XVI gave today before praying the midday Angelus with the pilgrims gathered in St. Peter’s Square..
Dear brothers and sisters!
This morning, during Holy Mass celebrated in the Sistine Chapel, I administered the sacrament of baptism to some newborn babies. This custom is linked to the Baptism of the Lord, with which the liturgical season of Christmas concludes.
The Baptism of the Lord suggests quite well the general sense of the Christmas festivity in which the theme of “becoming sons of God” thanks to the only-begotten Son’s taking on of our humanity constitutes a dominant element. He became man so that we could become sons of God. God is born so that we could be re-born.
These concepts continually return in the liturgical texts of Christmas and constitute a powerful motive for reflection and). This stupendous mystery that is our “second birth” — the re-birth of a human being from “above,” from God (cf. John 3:1-8) — is realized and summarized in the sacramental sign of baptism.
With this sacrament man really becomes son — son of God. From that point the goal of his life consists in arriving at, in a free and conscious way, that which from the very beginning was his destination as man. “Become what you are” — represents the basic educational principle of the human person redeemed by grace. Such a principle has many analogies with human growth, where the relationship between parents and children passes, through separation and crisis, from total dependence to the awareness of being children, to recognition through the gift of life received and to the maturity and capacity to give one’s life. Born to new life through baptism, the Christian too begins his journey of growth in the faith, which will carry him to consciously invoke God as “Abba — Father,” turning to him with gratitude and living in the joy of being his son...
The Meaning of the Person
[After the Angelus the Pope greeted the pilgrims in various languages. In Italian, he said:]
Dear brothers and sisters!
Two things drew my attention in a particular way recently: the case of migrants, who are seeking a better life in countries that need them for various reasons, and the conflicts in various parts of the world where Christians are the object of attacks, even violent ones.
We must start again from the heart of the problem! We must start again from the meaning of the person! An immigrant is a human being, different by provenance, culture and traditions, but a person to be respected with rights and duties, especially, in the sphere of work, where the temptation of exploitation is strongest, but also in the concrete conditions of life.
Violence must never be the way for anyone to solve problems. The difficulty is first of all a human one! I invite everyone to look into the face of the other and to see that he has a soul, a story and a life: He is a person and God loves him as he loves me.
I would like to propose similar considerations in regard to mankind in its religious diversity. Violence toward Christians in some countries has aroused the disdain of many, especially because it has manifested itself in the most sacred days of the Christian tradition. It is necessary that both political and religious institutions — I emphasize this — do not neglect their responsibility. There cannot be violence in the name of God, nor can we think that we honor him by offending the dignity and freedom of our equals.
Greetings
[In English, he said]
I greet all English-speaking visitors taking part in this Angelus prayer. Today, on the Feast of the Baptism of the Lord, the Church invites us to contemplate Jesus as the Messiah, the beloved Son of the Father, who gives us a share in the divine life through the gift of the Holy Spirit in the waters of Baptism. May all of us be renewed in the grace of our own Baptism and strengthened in faithful witness to the Gospel and its promises! Upon you and your families I invoke the Lord’s blessings of joy and peace.

21 May 2018, 09:55 | Updated: 21 May 2018, 10:21
Jordan Peterson told LBC he is refusing to let the government tell him what he can and can't say.
A bill in his native Canada has made it a hate crime not to use the correct pronoun for transgender and other non-binary groups.
And Mr Peterson, a Clinical Psychologist from Toronto University who has shot to prominence in recent months, says it is not the government's role to control what language you use, especially pronouns such as ze and zir.
Speaking to Maajid Nawaz, he said: "There's 70 different pronouns to hypothetically describe people who don't fit anywhere on the gender spectrum, which is also something I don't understand conceptually.
"A person is now compelled under Canadian law to use the pronoun of another individual's choice on pain of law.
"And I thought, no that's not acceptable.
"It's one thing to put limits on what a person can't say, like in hate speech laws, which I also don't agree with.
"But to compel me to use a certain content when I'm formulating my thoughts or my actions under threat of legislative action, I thought no, the government has introduced compelled speech legislation into the private sphere. It's never happened in the history of English common law, so I said there's no way I'm abiding by that.
"I don't care what you're damned rationale is. 'We're compassionate'. No you're not. You're playing this radical, collectivist left-wing game. You're trying to gain linguistic supremacy in the area of public discourse.
"You're doing this by using compassion as a guise as you're not going to do it with me."ORONO — The first pass was the scariest. With the University of Maine starting a drive at its 47, tight end Drew Belcher lined up on the right and ran into the flat, where quarterback Chris Ferguson threw him the ball.
“Just catch it and run,” said Belcher, when asked what he was thinking as the ball approached. “The first one, you wouldn’t want to drop it.”
He didn’t and the play went for 16 yards, a precursor to the rest of the night. Belcher, a redshirt junior, caught four passes for 67 yards in Maine’s 24-23 loss to New Hampshire, each catch resulting in a first down.
What makes those stats even more impressive is that, until Aug. 19, Belcher was a QB for the Black Bears.
That was the day Ferguson was named the starting quarterback by Maine Coach Joe Harasymiak, beating out Belcher and grad transfer Max Staver. Harasymiak and Liam Coen, Maine’s offensive coordinator, quickly asked Belcher to move to tight end.
“I’ve known that Drew Belcher was going to be a dynamic tight end since the day I walked into this building,” said Coen, in his second year with the Black Bears. “It was just a matter of him trusting us to do it. And he has 100 percent trusted us, put his faith in us and it’s paying off.”
The 6-foot-3, 240-pound Belcher had been a quarterback since the eighth grade, starting for three years at Reading (Massachusetts) High, where he graduated as the school’s all-time winningest quarterback (29-6). He came to Maine and battled Dan Collins for the starting job for three years, starting nine games.
But when Ferguson was named the starter, he was open to a move. “I just wanted to play as much as I can,” he said.
And the willingness to change his position said much about Belcher, whom Harasymiak called “the ultimate teammate, one of the best kids we have in the program.”
With Belcher, said Harasymiak, “It’s not about him. That’s the biggest problem I see in today’s game with kids coming out of high school. It’s all about them. Belch is the complete opposite. He’ll do anything for his teammates.”
In his first practice as a tight end, Belcher caught a touchdown pass, a glimpse at the play-making ability the Black Bears believe he brings to the offense.
“I knew it was coming,” said Ferguson, a redshirt freshman who threw for three touchdowns and two interceptions in his debut. “He is so smart, he just wants to win and wants to do anything to help this team. He’s worked so hard. I saw from competing with him how hard he works. I knew to stay with him.
“He was so supportive of me (when Ferguson was named the starter) and I saw that and said, ‘Wow, that’s so cool.’ And in practice the first day I threw a touchdown pass to him and said this is what it’s going to be like all season.”
The coaches certainly think he’ll be a factor, starting 3:30 p.m. Saturday when Maine plays its home opener against Bryant. Coen called him a “match-up problem” for a lot of teams.
“I truly believe he can be one of the best tight ends in the league,” said Harasymiak. “He’s dynamic and we can do a lot of stuff with him that will be challenging for opposing teams.”
The fact that he sees the game from a quarterback’s perspective is huge. He not only knows what he’s supposed to do on a play, but he sees the defense as Ferguson would.
“I know what he’s thinking,” said Belcher. “That definitely helps with coverages. I know what the defense is playing, I’ve seen all that stuff: two safeties high, one safety high. I see the soft spots in the defense.”
Of course, there are more things to consider. Fatigue for one thing. “There’s a lot more running than at quarterback,” said Belcher.
And blocking. That’s the biggest thing Belcher has to work on, since many times he’s blocking a larger defender.
“It’s something I’m getting used to, blocking guys in space,” said Belcher. “Most of it is just technique and stuff like that. After watching the game film, I can see where I can improve my technique and footwork. That’s where practice is especially important to me, getting all those reps.”
Belcher gets a lot of help from his roommate, offensive right tackle Cody Levy, and left tackle Jamil Demby, who show him blocking techniques.
“We’ve got to be smart, we can’t have him blocking at the point of attack,” said Coen. “But he’s getting better every day. There’s no doubt he’ll get there, it’s just a matter ofWhat your baby will learn in his first year
In your baby’s first year you’ll see huge advances in his development. Here’s your guide to what should happen when and how you can help…
Starting with holding his head up and moving onto rolling, sitting, crawling and standing, there are so many milestones to look forward to in your baby’s first year. But remember that all babies are unique and progress at a different pace, so use these indications as a guide only. And bear in mind that premature babies may reach milestones later than full-term babies. If you’re ever worried that your little one might not be progressing at the right speed speak to your health visitor.
From Month 1
“Whether your newborn baby’s lying on his back or his tummy, you’ll notice him turn his head to the side in his first month,” says Sheila O’Brien, health visitor, currently working as associate delivery manager for the Department of Health.
“Try talking to him from the side as he’ll love to look at your face close up and you may notice he’ll turn his head towards the sound of your voice too.”
Try this…
A baby bouncer will give your little one something to focus on other than the floor and the ceiling.
From Month 2
“Your baby may be able to roll part-way onto his side by now,” says Sheila. “And support the weight of his head when you hold him upright or when he’s on his tummy. He’s still wobbly though, so always be ready to support his head if he needs it.”
Try this…
“Leaving your little one lying on his changing mat on the floor after change time means he has the opportunity to wriggle around and try to roll over,” says Sheila. “But never leave him lying on the bed alone. And to help with lifting his head, place him on his tummy for a little while every day and attract his attention with a toy.”
Mum’s tip…
“We laid Henry on his tummy, put his arms on a pillow and his legs on the ground so he was at an angle. It encouraged his inquisitiveness and meant that when he did lift his head he could see a lot more than if he was flat.”
Celine Philibert, 25, from Surrey, mum to Henry, 5 months
From Month 4
“Your baby will have really good control of his head by now,” says Sheila. “If you hold him on your lap, he’ll keep his own head up, though sudden movements may make his head wobbly again. You’ll also notice that he may be able to roll from his front to his back too.”
Try this…
Hold his hands and pull him up gently from a lying to a sitting position, and he’ll try to hold his head up in line with his body.
From Month 6
Loads happens around now. As well as being able to roll from front to back, your baby is usually able to do it in reverse too. “If he can hold his head up confidently, you’ll find he should also be able to sit for a short while too,” says Sheila. “But he’ll need supporting. Make a secure tower of cushions or pillows for him to lean against and gradually reduce the amount as he gets more confident. But don’t leave him in the room alone. By around 8 months he should be able to sit without support.”
Try this:
If you don’t want the faff of pillows sit him up with this Blossom Farm Sit Me Up Cosy, from £40, from Early Learning Centre. Suitable from birth.
Mum’s tip…
“I found the best thing for teaching my little one to roll over was a mirror! He was so interested in his own reflection that as I gradually pulled the mirror away from him, he naturally rolled over to follow it!”
Kate Fever, 25, from Devon, mum to Gemma, 3, and Jacob, 1
Please read our Chat guidelines.First used as a necessary technique for pre-WWII clunky gear mechanisms, heel-toe shifting is largely unnecessary for daily drivers. Used mostly by motorsports professionals in high-octane cars and motorcycles, it’s not really something you need to learn unless, of course, you want to feel like a professional motorsports driver when you take the family van to the store to get milk. In which case, you should absolutely learn how to do it.
The fancy footwork of heel-toe shifting does have a lot of benefits. It reduces stress on the transmission, keeps the weight of your vehicle balanced during gear changes, helps to prevent wheel lock, and allows smoother and more efficient acceleration around corners.
At its core, heel-toe shifting is a way of getting around the fact that we don’t have three legs. Utilized mostly when approaching corners, it’s used to match engine speed (RPMs) to road speed through gear changes.
When you approach a corner and apply the brake, your car slows down and engine speed drops. Coming out of the corner, to compensate for your reduced speed, you shift into a lower gear, but depressing the clutch only causes engine speed to drop faster. By the time you’re ready to release the clutch in 2nd gear, the engine is practically idling even though you’re still rolling along at a good clip. When you do release the clutch, the engine has to race to catch up with the rest of the car.
These big swings in engine speed vs. road speed are highly inefficient and make all the difference in high-end racing where smooth acceleration around a corner is critical. Heel-toe shifting maintains engine speed so that it stays constant with your road speed, maximizing efficiency and power. To accomplish this, your brake foot rotates so that you can operate the throttle and the brake simultaneously during gear changes. Sound complicated? Follow the guide above, do some practicing, and you’ll have it down in no time.

if you had’ve told me 3 years ago that i would continue to create work that actively includes craft practices in spatial and media arts practice, i would probably have vomited on you. or at least told you that you had the wrong lauren brown.
but, it’s true. my short time spent at craft victoria influenced me profoundly and i find myself creating works that relate to fashion, thread, wearability, patterns, measurement and insertion.
craft victoria have reinvented their winter festival program from a single textile-based festival, to one that encompasses a range of craft/making practice and aims to remind everyone that there’s more to craft than bloody knitting scarves.
one of the interesting projects is called whitebox – a selection of video works that interact with the ideas, materials or gestures of craft practices. this year they also relate to the festival theme of childhood. and i’m privileged to have a video work in there: ariadne’s tangled mess.
it also includes some spanky works by some of my fave peeps: dell stewart, cory archangel and holly mcnaught.
the festival opens tonight at craft victoria and there are a stack of exhibitions, commissioned works, satellite events and online programs to participate in. check out the site for all the deets.One of the main things I wanted to achieve with this blog was exposing people to different bands/artists that might not have ever been heard of, while at the same time, being able to tackle acts that, well, everyone may know. I want to romanticize newer records and older records just the same, as that’s how I often feel about music in general, just really attached to it like a love affair. For the most part since I started these musings I’ve stayed mostly current, so I’m going to take the opportunity for this installment to talk about a record from 2001 by a band called Serum.
In all honesty, I don’t know so much about this band; back in ‘01 I was given a promo of their self-titled debut. It was a one sheet promo with no information inside about the group or members, etc. The only information was on the back cover which basically addressed the production and the label they were on, Brick Red Records, which I was actually familiar with because I was into another artist from this imprint called Math & Science, which is a total opposite sounding performer in relation to Serum. And really, I’m not quite sure if this CD was ever properly released as I’ve only ever seen promos.
Anyway, I took the record home and obviously liked it enough to add it to my collection. It really wasn’t until a few years ago that I revisited it and got heavily into them and this great, lost recording. By this point, they were done, their site was defunct and well…it’s been hard to dig up much about them at all.
It’s a drag how so many awesome bands never get found out; luckily I keep my nose heavily to the underground and often make great discoveries. Not sure how big they were back in 2001 or so in Los Angeles from which they hailed from. I imagine it was hard for them to really find their niche in the Alternative/Rock world given the sound they so perfectly projected which was somewhat borderline Psychedelic Classic Rock while maintaining an Alt Rock vibe.
Serum gave us an 11 track self-titled record that almost at times sounds like a glorified demo. It’s raw and under produced, but I mean that in the fondest of ways. There is a charm and subtlety here that was captured and put down onto tape in such a gracious fashion. The whole album sounds like it was done through old combo amps and vintage everything. Singer Erwin Herceg’s voice and delivery channels both Shannon Hoon and Janis Joplin fondly as he sings “Through love I learned to fear, through fear I learned to hate, through hate I learned to love, all over…all over again,” in one of the many stand out tracks, “Bleed”. His whole vocal performance on the album is delivered in such gravelly soul that it kinda warms your heart. Erwin’s approach is both tender, and humble.
Back to the whole psychedelic vibe, another true champion of a song, “Rocket Scientist” gives us one of the best gang vocal hooks I’ve heard in the past 15 years, “Take me to that magic place where mosquitoes sing and the ants all dance, and all the fish walk around with a smile. Where the sky is green and the grass is blue and you don’t have to take off your shoes just to sit, and talk for a while.” A fun and jangly piece which again is delivered in such an endearing fashion by the entire band, you really get the idea that they were completely content with the musical offerings on this album; it’s not showy or overly complex and therein lies the appeal.
An interesting tidbit about this LP is the secret track titled for the bands namesake, “Serum”. It’s probably the best sounding and most polished song on the whole record. Could be they finished the album and threw this on last minute, cutting it at a different studio with a different producer or engineer, who knows, it’s almost puzzling but it’s just so damn sweet and leaves you so grateful for another song, indeed craving a second album.
Although I was unable to dig up much about Serum online I did find that two of the members, Singer Erwin Herceg and instrumentalist Dino Malito had gone on to collaborate on a project called Captain Black Heart (not even sure if this partnership is still active) in which I still need to dive into and am excited to do so as more music from these guys is a joyful thought.
So, if your interest is peaked, hop onto Amazon and grab a super cheap copy of the Serum record and treat your ears.
Godspeed..

I have had an interest in Fire Safety since childhood and been an active fire safety professional since 1998, focussing on fire risk assessment and training (fire and first aid) as well as supporting clients in undertaking fire safety capital expenditure remedial works by managing the project to ensure the best balance of cost v quality and ensuring works actually meet the requirements of the fire risk assessment.
I am a specialist in first aid fire fighting, first working with extinguishers in the early 90's and still undertaking maintenance & supply services. I have broadened my specialism into the fire alarm field via advanced training in system design.
I am a believer in risk based provision & for clients to make an informed choice in their fire safety provisions so that they are clear as to what must be done as a minimum and what is optional extra protection - too many fire safety providers err on the side of caution and always recommend the highest protection as a mandatory requirement, even if the risk doesn't warrant it.
I maintain a number of professional memberships and accreditations as part of furthering my knowledge:
- Member of the Institute of Fire Safety Managers
- Member of the Institute of Fire Prevention Officers
- Chartered Member of the Institute of Occupational Safety & Health
I am interested in the history of Fire Safety and collect information and literature on past historic fires that have influenced safety in the 20th century, & fire extinguishers, with a collection of literature, films (many of which are made available to all via YouTube) and actual equipment.I was recently at a local hospital because my mom was having surgery. I was waiting on the second floor and suddenly became very ill and passed out. I was with family and, luckily, was right above the children's emergency room.
Before I knew it, I was in the children's emergency room on a gurney, they were rushing around me and the whole time they were treating me like I was the queen of England. My point is they were an exceptional staff, and basically they were "magical."
It is so worth noting their exceptional personal caring qualities. My 12-year-old daughter appreciates so much how they treated and took care of me, even if I'm not a kid. Kudos to the emergency room staff.
DEBBIE SHERMAN/Lubbock(The Immortality Option, by James P. Hogan. Gallantine, 1995, 323 pp.; out of print, but commonly available in used bookstores and also available as an overpriced e-book)
reviewed by Zeke Teflon
This is the sequel to Hogan’s amusing and insightful Code of the Lifemaker, which we reviewed in June. It takes up where Code of the Lifemaker leaves off, with the Taloid mechanoid civilization on Titan, the mutant spawn of a damaged interstellar alien probe a million years ago, temporarily saved, but still under both internal threat from religious and political authoritarianism, and under external threat from GSEC, a rapacious Earth-based corporation.
The cast of characters is mostly the same as in Code of the Lifemaker. Like that book, this sequel is a combination of hard sci-fi and social sci-fi, and the political and social subtext is essentially the same: that science, free inquiry, and free expression are essential to progress, and that religion is inimical to progress, and its practitioners often irrationally and sadistically cruel.
What’s new in The Immortality Option is the revelation of where the interstellar probe came from that set off the explosion of mechanical evolution on Titan: the Borjilans, an avian-descended race from a star a thousand light years off. The description of that race and their ultra-competitive civilization is highly amusing. From reading it, I strongly suspect that Hogan was at least somewhat familiar with avian behavior; here, he focuses almost exclusively on its negative, darkly comedic aspects.
The one real problem with Hogan’s description of the events leading up to the launching of the probe is that it hinges on a cover up of an existential threat to the Borjilan home world that would be impossible to hide in any even remotely open society. That’s unfortunate, because there were ways Hogan could have avoided this implausibility. But he didn’t, and at least the chapters on the Borjilans are so intricate and amusing that it’s fairly easily to overlook the implausibility of the pivotal cover up.
Without giving away too much, The Immortality Option deals largely with the encoded personalities of one the Borjilans (especially Sarvik, the primary Borjilan character), the pompous scientist (Weinerbaum, a new character) who discovers them, GENIUS, an AI created by Sarvik, and the machinations of the Borjilans and the Taloid priests and authoritarian politicians, and their rational foes among the Taloids and “Lumians” (humans).
While probably not as good a book as Code of the Lifemaker, The Immortality Option is still a lot of fun in its own right.
Recommended — but do yourself a favor and read Code of the Lifemaker first.

I enjoyed this enthusiastic review of a neglected book, so wanted to share it with you. What books have you read that you consider overlooked masterpieces?
Thank you. The best sci-fi books often are not the most popular, the most popular are often not the best, and it’s good to give credit where it’s still due — even if it’s decades late.
I wholeheartedly agree! There have been several books very much lauded recently that I frankly found unreadable – while there are some wonderful books that NEVER get their due. One of the most scandalously underrated series is the late, great Kage Baker’s Company novels… The last two had moments of silliness, but the earlier ones are the best of the best…
Yes. Agreed again. It’s unfortunate Baker died so young. I read one of her “Company” novels a couple of years ago (can’t remember which one–I read 30 to 50 sci-fi books annually) and enjoyed it.
As for the ones receiving undeserved plaudits, I dissected two currently popular ones recently–one absolutely awful, the other deeply flawed. I prefer writing positive reviews, but while bad books are popular and good ones go unrecognized, I think there’s value in pointing out what’s wrong with the bad ones.

Oh yes, I do agree – I have NO problem with reading critical reviews. I just HATE writing them… Mostly if a book is a real dog, I don’t finish it. And if it is really lousy then I just want to forget it… But there is definitely real value in a balanced, valid criticism of any book. Sadly a few successful writers seem to get sloppier, rather than better…

Yes, I can think of a few authors among former favorites who fit that description.
BTW, I don’t follow sci-fi news at all (just read novels and short story collections), and heard that Kage Baker was only in her early 30s when she died. If you know, please let me know what happened to her. Thanks.

Are you a nonprofit operating in the EU? Are you an organization in the United States who has constituents in the EU? Have you been selected as the DPO (Data Protection Officer) at your organization, you’re still not sure what your strategy for respecting the rights and maintaining the privacy of the people whose data you guard?
Well, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) goes into effect May 25th, just over two months from today. On that day, any organization that maintains personal data of people within the EU will be under strict guidelines on the collection, storage, and maintenance of their data.
Given that Frakture is really into Data Warehousing, and that that data is often personal in nature, we and the bots are very eager to ensure our own compliance. Not only that, we are excited at how organizations (our customers and otherwise) working with EU constituents and customers can use Data Warehousing to ensure their own compliance.
As an organization, the key pieces of GDPR that you need to be aware of and comply with (and how Frakture can help) are:
Consent
“Consent must be clear and distinguishable from other matters and provided in an intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language. It must be as easy to withdraw consent as it is to give it.”
This is essentially a much stricter version of existing anti-spam legislation. Before now you had “opt out” options for your constituents. If they did not want to receive communication from you, you had to respect their wishes. But, you did not have to remove their data and their ability to finetune what you do with their data was limited. The GDPR guarantees a much more nuanced set of options for your constituents – each channel you use to communicate must be explicitly allowed.
For example, your donor Charles receives email, mail and phone calls from you…
Many of our customers already use data warehousing and our bots to keep track of opt outs across systems – commonly between different channels (i.e., someone opts out of Mobile Commons and we make sure that opt out is processed in Luminate Online). GDPR makes this application of warehousing even more important than before – a standardized look at your data makes it easy to match consent configurations between systems.
Right to Access
“..the right for data subjects to obtain from the data controller confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning them is being processed, where and for what purpose…”
“..the controller shall provide a copy of the personal data, free of charge, in an electronic format.”
When you warehouse, you collect data from different systems into the same place. Not only do you have the data, you know where it came from. If a constituent wants to know what data you have and where, you could spend quite a bit of time combing your various systems, recording the information that exists among the systems and noting which systems are using it, and then send that information to a constituent. With warehousing, it’s a simple case of looking at your tables, and voila – you have the data in a nice standardized format for them regardless of how many systems you pull from.
Right to be Forgotten
“… the right to be forgotten entitles the data subject to have the data controller erase his/her personal data, cease further dissemination of the data, and potentially have third parties halt processing of the data.”
You might think that warehousing complicates the Right to be Forgotten – and in a way it does. You have one more place to remove a constituent from when they opt out. But removal is a much simpler procedure in a warehouse than in a CRM or other tool. Removing someone from a warehouse is as simple as dropping them from the table.
In fact – warehousing helps ensure that you are forgetting people. A centralized warehouse with a list of IDs of those who have been forgotten (just the ID, no personal information) can be used to ensure that the record has been removed from your other systems and can alert you if someone who has opted out is still present in another system.
Data Portability
“… the right for a data subject to receive the personal data concerning them, which they have previously provided in a ‘commonly use and machine readable format’ and have the right to transmit that data to another controller“
As we touched on in the Right to Access, Data Warehouses (well, Frakture’s Data Warehouses – we won’t speak for anyone else) are standardized. This means that the data you store for your constituents is as portable as it gets – it is all in one place, in one shape, and can be looked up very quickly.
Privacy by Design
“The controller shall..implement appropriate technical and organisational measures..in an effective way.. in order to meet the requirements of this Regulation and protect the rights of data subjects…”
“…calls for controllers to hold and process only the data absolutely necessary for the completion of its duties (data minimisation), as well as limiting the access to personal data to those needing to act out the processing”
When you warehouse, you get to choose the data you store – that’s the one of the best things about warehousing. GDPR comes with the requirement that as little data as possible is kept by systems, and that only those who really need access to the data have it. It’s almost like GDPR was made with warehousing in mind. While Frakture will give you access to your own data warehouse, we make sure to keep that access as restricted as possible.
Beyond being private by design ourselves, we can help you figure out if there is more information in a sub system than you intended. While we can’t see inside the database of your CRM, we can tell you what information is available to us, helping you be sure that you only have the data you think you have, and not the data you know you don’t want..
Arguably both the simplest and most crucial to address – Frakture will immediately notify any customers (regardless of EU interaction) in the event of a data breach. We strongly recommend getting such reassurances from all of your service providers (again, even if you have no interaction with the EU).
Conclusion
Given that Organizations use several different systems to manage and communicate with constituents, making sure that that Organization and all of its tools are compliant is a heavy ask. But the ask is similar, in practice, to the other asks that Warehousing answers. Warehousing gives you your data, potentially all of it, and once you have all of your data you can ensure that you’re compliant. Not only that, warehousing coupled with smart automation can help you reach that compliance efficiently.The Swedish Polar Research Secretariat has created two different scientific advisory groups.

Postmodern Economics – Introduction
The following quotations by Rorty and Ruccio and Amariglio illustrate one of the hurdles to understanding Postmodern economics—a lack of consensus among Postmodernists:
(David F. Ruccio and Jack Amariglio)1
“Just about the only constructive suggestion Marx made, the abolition of private property, has been tried. It did not work."
(Richard Rorty)2
Ruccio and Amariglio expose the heart of Postmodern economics—and to understand them, we must define unified self and decentered self and why they are said to be fictions. Postmodern Economics – ‘I.’”5] ‘really’ looks like..”7.8
One of the major goals of Postmodern economics is to eliminate the distinction between men and women, a distinction that has been “inculcated by an oppressive patriarchal society.”9.

Industries are deploying AI for more cost-effective and efficient solution. The machines are performing feats which are humanly impossible. AI will be integrated more into our lives over time. The hype surrounding AI’s potential has made us to overlook its current utility. The technology is still in its nascent stage and there’s a long journey ahead for it to reach the superhuman level of intelligence.
The impact that AI will have on different sectors of the economy is a widely debated topic. It comes as no surprise since leading technological innovations have always been met with fear and uncertainty. It’s now difficult to imagine a job in near future that ultimately smart computers won’t be able to do. So, with the advancement of AI, it’s important to know where we stand and how it can alter the future.
Customer Service Operations would be dominated
People often complain about the inefficiency of customer services. With the current developments in AI, it is estimated that around 85 percent of customer service interactions will be handled by AI by 2020.
Opening Up of new opportunities
It is estimated that one-third of jobs in the US will be automated by 2030. AI will be able to automate everything from driving, writing, performing surgery, and everything in between. There is hardly any industry immune from AI’s impact.
Disaster Management will be Prompter
AI will become more responsive towards human emotions and contexts over time. AI-powered robots will be able to do a lot of things which are ascribed only to humans. Machines will take over most of the dangerous and hazardous jobs for humans like bomb defusing, welding, etc. They can also play an active role in maintaining traffic and managing disasters like earthquake and flood. Smart computers will be able to predict climate change and changes in the environment more precisely and can make humans aware of any impending disasters. It can also resolve the problem of food waste by using smart logistics and shipping.
Health Sector would be revolutionized
With AI and Big Data, the trend of personalized medicine or precision medicine will become common. After identifying symptoms based on patient data and records, it will be possible to understand the mechanism of the disease and accordingly personalized treatments can be suggested. AI can also give way for intelligent prosthetics for manipulation. Moreover, assistance to patients through robots instead of humans will also be more common. Sophia, the AI robot with Saudi Arabian citizenship was created with the vision to help elderly people with personal needs.
Fraud Detection will be Easier
In the financial sector, it will be easier to detect fraud. With deep learning and machine learning algorithms used in predictive modelling, prediction of the likelihood of an event will be easier. Increasingly, more financial institutions will deploy AI for fraud detection.
Virtual Assistants will Become Common
One of the major impacts of AI will be personalization in every front. With AI algorithms, personal consumer data will be tracked and analyzed to deliver a personalized experience to consumers. It will be able to suggest likely recommendations for thousands of consumers by analyzing data, which is humanly impossible. So, AI will offer personal virtual assistance to each consumer.
Misuse of AI
The increasing penetration of technology in our daily activities with future machines will offer greater autonomy and power. This may give way to vulnerability and susceptibility concerning security. Machines imitating and acquiring psychological capabilities of humans can become dangerous for human existence. If the AI-powered robot falls into the wrong hands, it can be programmed to do something devastating and thus result in mass causalities.PeopleSoft, Oracle spar over investors / Each claims to have secured big blocks of stock; Friday is deadline for $24 offer
Oracle Corp.'s epic quest to acquire PeopleSoft Inc. intensified Tuesday when the two warring companies said major institutional investors are taking sides in the battle.
PeopleSoft kicked things off by saying Private Capital Management, a Florida investment firm that controls roughly 9.5 percent of its stock, was going to reject Oracle's offer. Oracle countered by saying Capital Guardian Trust, a Los Angeles firm that owns nearly 6 percent of PeopleSoft shares, has decided to sell its shares to Oracle.
Although PeopleSoft accused Oracle of making a false claim and deliberately misleading its investors, the tit for tat highlighted the uncertainty over the hostile takeover saga, which may or may not come to a head Friday, the most recent deadline Oracle has given for PeopleSoft shareholders to tender their shares for $24 apiece.
Of course, there's also the possibility that Oracle will simply extend the deadline for shareholders to sell, as it has done in the past.
Regardless, it was seen as a victory for PeopleSoft that Private Capital Management, the Florida firm that controls 366 million PeopleSoft shares, announced that it does not plan to tender its shares for the current offering price of $24.
The firm cited significant concerns about whether Oracle's $8.8 billion bid "fully reflects the value PeopleSoft shareholders may realize over the intermediate term from PeopleSoft's continued operation as an independent company," according to a regulatory filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
On the other side of the ledger, an Oracle spokesperson said Tuesday that Capital Guardian Trust has agreed to sell its shares to the Redwood City software company. Oracle needs to win a majority of outstanding shares to move a giant step closer toward gobbling up PeopleSoft.
PeopleSoft's board of directors has urged shareholders to reject Oracle's price, which it says undervalues the company. Chuck Freadhoff, a spokesman for Capital Guardian Trust, declined to comment.
PeopleSoft accused Oracle of misleading its shareholders.
"We believe that Oracle's disclosure of Capital Guardian's tender plans was made to intentionally create the wrong impression that Capital Guardian endorses the $24 offer," PeopleSoft said in a statement.
"We have spoken to Capital Guardian since Oracle issued its release today, and Capital Guardian reiterated that they believe PeopleSoft is worth substantially more than $24 per share," the statement said.
Capital Guardian owns about 5.9 percent of PeopleSoft shares. It is an affiliate of Capital Group International Inc. in Los Angeles which, in total, controls 10.2 percent of PeopleSoft shares.
Each company within the group makes its own investment decisions, Freadhoff said.
"We are in an intense lobbying period," said analyst Erin Kinikin of Forrester Research, who does not own Oracle or PeopleSoft stock.
"Everybody is going to look for trends. Ultimately, it comes down to the straw vote that the board has to look at," Kinikin said.
Oracle has said it will drop its unsolicited bid if it fails to win a majority of PeopleSoft shares. If Oracle succeeds, PeopleSoft's board of directors could use an anti-takeover measure called a poison pill.
It allows the board to issue additional shares to prevent a hostile bidder from obtaining a majority of the company's stock.
Both companies are waiting for a Delaware court's ruling on Oracle's bid to overturn the measure.
"Personally, I think it'll get done," said Robert Stimson, an independent analyst who does not own Oracle or PeopleSoft stock. "It's not good for anyone that this is going on for so long. I think we need to get some finality here, and we're going to get it in the next three days."
Analyst Tad Piper of Piper Jaffray & Co. said he wasn't so sure.
"It's not the final three days," said Piper, who does not own Oracle or PeopleSoft stock.
If more than 50 percent of shares are tendered, he added, Oracle faces an uphill battle trying to get the PeopleSoft board to rescind the poison pill.
"The next step is likely a proxy battle early next year," Piper said.
That means Oracle would have to field its own slate of candidates in a bid to win control of the PeopleSoft board during its next shareholder meeting in 2005.
Stimson speculated that, if Oracle prevails on Friday, the Delaware Court will simply tell PeopleSoft's board, "Why are you doing this? We're taking the poison pill out."
But, Piper said, with PeopleSoft's next board elections just a few months away, the court may also decide to give investors more time to hear both sides.
Still, in the event of a proxy war, PeopleSoft's board will be under enormous pressure, Kinikin said.
"If Oracle gets more than 50 percent, there is a good chance it can get more than 50 percent in the shareholder meeting to elect a new board and to remove the poison pill," she said.
"The PeopleSoft board has to look around and ask, 'Can we show investors that PeopleSoft can be more profitable to them between now' " and the next shareholder meeting?
PeopleSoft shares rose 20 cents, less than 1 percent, to $22.74 in Tuesday's regular trading. Oracle shares dipped 9 cents, less than 1 percent, to $12.92. bike seat, narrower diameter bike grips, 27.5” wheels, and grippy Kenda tires.

First posted on Alex's blog on June 10th.
The British House of Lords has debated many assisted suicide bills over the past few years. In fact the House of Lords debated the Falconer assisted suicide bill in the past year, a bill that died on the order paper before the election. The House of Commons has not debated an assisted suicide bill in 20 years.
Yesterday backbencher British Labour MP, Rob Marris, was chosen first in the Private Members bill ballot giving Marris the right to introduce Falconer's assisted suicide bill in the House of Commons.
According to the BBC, the Marris assisted suicide bill is scheduled for its first hour of debate on September 11.
Prime Minister David Cameron, who has a majority government, opposes assisted suicide. The Express and Star
reported that Cameron told his weekly Prime Minister's Question Time that:
"I don't support the assisted dying proposals. I don't support euthanasia."
...problems with the existing law can be 'dealt with sensitively' without 'bringing in euthanasia'."
The Express and Star reported that Mark Atkinson, the interim chief of the disability rights charity - Scope warned that legalizing assisted suicide would put people with disabilities at risk. The Express and Star stated:
"Many disabled people are really worried about the legalisation of assisted suicide.
"They are concerned that it will lead to them feeling under pressure to end their lives."
While Agnes Fletcher, Director of Living and Dying Well, added:
"The bill contains very few explicit safeguards."
The Care Not Killing Alliance, Not Dead Yet UK, Living and Dying Well coalition and many other groups oppose the assisted suicide bill because it gives physicians, the right in law to cause the death of their patients when their patients are at the most vulnerable time of their lives.

Matthias Doepke is professor of economics at Northwestern University. He lives in Evanston, Illinois. Fabrizio Zilibotti is the Tuntex Professor of International and Development Economics at Yale University. He lives in New Haven, Connecticut.
Economics is usually the last thing on people's minds when they think about parenting. This wonderfully readable and original book aims to change that. It shows how different parenting styles are all about trade-offs, how they shape the way children explore and experiment with the world and take risks, and how economic factors have played an important role in the striking changes we have experienced in the way parents think about their children and parent them. A must-read. --Daron Acemoglu, coauthor of Why Nations Fail Bringing together personal experiences, reasoning, and evidence, this fascinating and persuasive book shows that parenting decisions are governed by incentives and an economic approach can help us to understand why parents' choices might vary across countries and over time. The wealth of information, detail, and strength of economic argument is impressive. --Jo Blanden, coauthor of The Persistence of Poverty across Generations Presenting many key findings and novel explanations, Love, Money, and Parenting argues that we can use economic principles to explain why different parenting styles exist across different countries and within countries at any given point in time. At once intelligent, sophisticated, and accessible, there is no other book that tackles the same themes as this one. I really enjoyed reading it. --Nattavudh Powdthavee, author of The Happiness Equation Love, Money, and Parenting presents a fascinating, insightful analysis of the origins and consequences of different parenting styles over time and place. Doepke and Zilibotti explain how and why parents shape child preferences and skills to adapt their offspring to the anticipated social and economic realities facing them as adults. The authors creatively use basic economic theory to integrate and interpret a vast body of evidence from multiple disciplines. This ambitious, well-argued book carefully examines how families influence the social and economic fortunes of their children. --James J. Heckman, Nobel Laureate in Economics In their stimulating account of the reasons behind different parenting practices, Doepke and Zilibotti unashamedly argue for an economic interpretation, while also including social and cultural factors. Worryingly, the authors show how emerging societal divisions could enable some parents to promote their children even as they disable the efforts of parents in more difficult economic circumstances. Parenting regimes by class threaten equal opportunities, social mobility, and political participation. The authors' hope is that thoughtful policy interventions can head off such threats. --Jane Humphries, author of Childhood and Child Labour in the British Industrial RevolutionMoraira|Villa|3 Bedrooms

Published on September 18th, 2017
In this Sailing World report by Andy Horton with Dave Powlison, they explain how using your sail plan to shift gears upwind and downwind puts you in the right mode for the right time.
If the wind never changed, there was never a reason to get to one side of the course, or other boats never influenced your positioning, you could always sail to your target speed and angle, or velocity made good, but we know that seldom happens. That’s why you must rely on “moding”: sailing a little higher or lower than your targets for a tactical or strategic advantage, upwind as well as downwind.
Other than the target VMG, I like to think in terms of two other modes. Upwind, there’s high/slow and low/fast. Downwind, there’s low/slow and high/fast.
As an example, upwind, right off the starting line, you might find yourself in a position where you have to work hard to stay to windward of a group of boats. Then you switch to a high and slow mode. Or maybe you want to be the first one to reach a shift or puff ahead. Then you switch to the low and fast mode. If you’re sailing downwind, you get to that puff quicker by going to the high and fast mode. If you find yourself too high for the final approach to a leeward mark with not enough time and distance to jibe, then time for low and slow.
How much higher or lower are we talking about when switching into these modes? Not as much as you’d think, the difference between the slow modes, both upwind and down, and the optimum VMG angle, is only about 3 to 5 degrees. The difference between the fast modes, upwind and down, and the optimum VMG angle, is a bit more, sometimes as much as 10 degrees.
A common mistake is to move into a different mode by simply steering those few degrees higher or lower. Do only that, and you’ll never realize the advantage to the four modes:
• Upwind Low and Fast
• Upwind High and Slow
• Downwind High and Fast
• Downwind Low and Slow
Here’s a look at the mechanics behind each mode and what you need to do to make moding work for you…click here.Accessory maker Belkin with its stable of brands – Belkin, Linksys, Wemo and Phyn returns to CES 2019 after its merge with Foxconn Interconnect Technology.

Admit it, weather going out on the town, preparing for that weekend romp or simply gearing up for work, you get a certain thrill selecting your outfit from a well organized display. What, this doesn?t describe your closet? These closet organizer tips will help.
One of the challenges with crafting any kind of closet storage space is that your needs may change. Most wood shelving is expensive, and it usually can?t expand as your storage needs evolve.
To make the most of your closet organization efforts, you first need to know the potential uses of your space and of the things you want to store. You may be able to use the space you have more efficiently.
Start with a general inventory. This can help you determine your space needs.
Do you and/or your spouse have too many clothes, shoes and other accessories? Are your dressers full and there just doesn’t seem to be enough space in your closet?
Analyze your storage needs, inspect available spaces. Your situation isn?t as bad as it seems.
Closet kits today offer enough flexibility that you can change the design to suit your changing needs, which allows you to customize the closet to fit individual needs and lifestyles.
Or simply tame your piles with pretty colored baskets in all shapes and sizes.
Shoes used to be something that sat on the floor, then came simple shoe racks and shelves. This was great for organization and more protection for expensive shoes.
Closet organizers use the space in your closet that doesn’t ordinarily get used, it expands your storage.
Some organizers simply hang the from the closet rod and store folded clothes, shoes and more on the shelves and in the mesh compartments.
Different components allow you to easily organize and add storage space to your closet; arrange it countless ways and reconfigure it as often as you like.
Telescoping rods and expanding shelves are so quick and easy, you can reconfigure your closet organizer system at any time.
With a hamper basket you have a dedicated spot within the closet for dirty clothes which will help anyone?s room ? especially kids rooms ? remain a little more organized.
Also consider ventilation: closets ? especially those with
hampers ? need some air circulation to remain fresh. You might also consider disposable air fresheners designed for use in the closet.
Organize your closet by season, work, weekend or his and hers clothing.
There are enough options on the market to go from basic to one-of-a-kind with add-on accessories such as shoe storage racks, extra closet shelving, wire baskets, and tie & belt organizers to fit your specific needs.You have no items in your shopping cart.

Isaac Has Now Played in 28 Straight Games, One More Than All of Last Season
ORLANDO – For an extended period of the season now, the focus surrounding Orlando Magic forward Jonathan Issac has been on his jump shot, his difference-making defensive abilities and how he has meshed in the starting lineup alongside fellow forward Aaron Gordon.
The focus, however, hasn’t been on Isaac’s ankles – and that’s a very good thing considering the trouble that he had last season as a rookie.
Saturday’s game against the Boston Celtics was Issac’s 28th straight game of the season – one more than he played all of last season because of various ankle sprains. He worked hard all summer to grow his game and strengthen his ankles and it has paid off to the point that after Saturday he will have played in 35 of the team’s 42 games.
``It feels great to string together more games than I played the entire last year,’’ said Isaac, Orlando’s No. 6 pick from the 2017 NBA Draft. ``It’s exciting, I’m glad to be healthy and I’m glad to be out on the floor.’’
Magic coach Steve Clifford, who often compares Isaac to former Magic great Rashard Lewis because of his lengthy body and willingness to sacrifice for the team, has averaged 7.9 points, 4.6 rebounds and 1.11 blocks in 24.5 minutes a night. Shooting has been an issue as he’s made just 40.4 percent of his field goals and 28.4 percent from 3-point range. He seemed poised to come out of his shooting slump on Wednesday in Utah by drilling two of his four 3-point attempts.
All of it has been possible thanks to a team effort by Isaac, the Magic’s front office and their medical team to help get his ankles strong and steady again. Other than a minor sprain in the preseason and another one in the first month of the regular season that cost him six games on the sidelines, Isaac has been healthy and growing for the Magic.
``Really, the summer was huge, getting my foot right and I haven’t had many issues,’’ Isaac said. ``Other than early in the season with a couple of light sprains I haven’t had any issues because I’ve been focusing on it. Our training staff and our management team are doing their best to make sure I’m taken care of and it’s been great. It allows me to just get my mindset ready to play and not have my ankle in the back of my mind. It’s just about the game now.’’
MAGIC PROTECTING PLAYERS FROM GERMS: For the Magic, defense extends well beyond the parquet floor of the Amway Center when it comes to protecting their players.
The Magic have partnered with Violet Defense, an Orlando-based germ-killing company with patented UV technology, to bring the first-known deployment of hospital-grade UV cleaning to the NBA.
Utilizing the full spectrum of ultraviolet light, Violet Defense’s products deliver germ-free protection throughout the air and onto any contact surface that is exposed to UV light. Their technology, which can be used or installed in a mobile format, has been proven to kill 99.9 percent of key bacteria and viruses, including E. Coli, Salmonella, Norovirus and even superbugs like MRSA.
``The Orlando Magic are committed to winning and the innovations that provide the best opportunities to do that,’’ Magic President of Basketball Operations Jeff Weltman said. ``We are thrilled about what this partnership with Violet Defense could bring to our team, and most importantly, ways to keep a healthy locker room.’’
The Magic will deploy a variety of products Violet Defense’s surface and air germ elimination (S.A.G.E.) UV line in their locker rooms, training rooms, weight rooms, dining areas and medical areas. The Magic also plan to add this technology to their family area to disinfect the nursery, children’s play areas and bathrooms.
``We are always looking for opportunities to keep our players healthy,’’ Magic High Performance Director David Tenney said. ``And by keeping our players healthy and on the court, that gives us the best chance to win. With this exclusive partnership, we now have another tool available to help us do that.’’
Added Terrance Berland, Chief Executive Officer of Violet Defense: `.’’
HOME IS WHERE THE SUCCESS IS: Through the first 41 games of the season, the Magic actually played one more game as the home team than they did as the road team. However, it probably doesn’t feel that way considering that two of their games – both of which were stirring victories – were played in Mexico City.
If the Magic are going to make a playoff run over the final 41 games of the season, they are going to have to be significantly better than the 10-11 at home that they came into Saturday with, head coach Steve Clifford said.
Again, taking into account that two of those victories were in Mexico, the Magic came into the weekend just 8-11 at the Amway. For whatever reason, some of Orlando’s most lopsided losses of the season have come at the eight-plus-year-old Amway Center. To put together a second-half run the Magic will have to play more like the squad that has beaten Toronto, Philadelphia and the Los Angeles Lakers at the Amway Center, Clifford insisted.
``I’ll say this, and we have to be honest, but we have a frustration that we have try and get rid of,’’ Clifford said of Orlando’s home struggles. ``We’ve played some clunkers and more of them in this building (in Orlando). You go back to Clippers here, Portland here, San Antonio here, where we have lacked energy and didn’t give ourselves a chance to win.’’
UP NEXT: After facing the surging Boston Celtics on Saturday, things won’t get any easier on Sunday when the Magic host superstar guard James Harden and the Houston Rockets. It will be the first meeting of the season between the two teams. Tipoff is just after 6 p.m.
Houston smashed Cleveland 141-113 on Friday thanks to a Harden’s 43 points, 12 assists and 10 rebounds. Not only was it his 15th straight 30-point game, but it was the 12th 40-point triple-double of his career. Last season, Harden set the NBA record for most points (60) in a triple-double in a game against the Magic.
``I watched a little bit of (the Houston-Cleveland game) and he’s just on a roll,’’ Clifford said of Harden. ``We’ll deal with that (on Sunday).’’

Hizbullah Executive Council chairman Hashem Safi Al-Din stated explicitly that the organization's fighters are still present throughout Syria, including in the south of the country, where they are taking part in the fighting alongside Assad's forces. These statements contradict claims by Russia and reports by many media outlets, that the Iranian forces, Hizbullah and the Shi'ite militias subordinate to Iran have withdrawn from southern Syria in compliance with the demand of Israel and the U.S.[1]
Safi Al-Din's deputy, 'Ali Da'mush, stressed that, thanks to their steadfastness and sacrifices, the Syrian army and its allies have managed to regain control of all Syrian territory, and called this "a great achievement." He added that the U.S. has begun to accept its defeat in Syria and the fact that President Assad will remain in power.
The following are excerpts from the statements by these two Hizbullah officials:[2]
Hashem Safi Al-Din (image: alwatanvoice.com)
The Resistance Has Not Retreated From Southern Syria
Speaking at a memorial held by Hizbullah in Al-Nabatiyya in honor of its martyrs from that town, Hashem Safi Al-Din said: "Nobody can take the banner of resistance away from us, not even Trump or Netanyahu. We shall continue upholding this banner, and Allah will grant [us] the certain victory that was promised us. The first goal of the resistance is to fight for the sake of Allah, so that the Islamic ummah can live in true dignity and freedom and continue bearing witness that there is no god but Allah and Muhammad is his Messenger, and so that no enemy will confront [this ummah] in an attempt to desecrate its sanctities.
"One year after Israel's statements [that Iran and Hizbullah must withdraw from southern Syria] and the U.S. plot to remove the forces of the resistance from [there], we see the result: the resistance is part of the campaign for southern Syria, and the ones who are retreating from there today, and will retreat tomorrow, are those who collaborated with the U.S. and Israel [i.e., the Syrian opposition forces]. To date, the resistance has yet to retreat from southern Syria or from any other part of it. It is the American and Israeli enterprises, that have been defeated and will be defeated in the future, that will withdraw from [southern Syria] and from Syria at large."
The Resistance Will Maintain Its Might, In Lebanon And The Region
Safi Al-Din added: "Anyone who thinks that there will be a new Sykes-Picot [agreement], or is betting on this, is mistaken. Moreover, anyone who thinks that the U.S. and the West, or any other country in the world, can decide the fate of this region – from Yemen to Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, Palestinian and elsewhere – [and decide that] the resistance will not be present in it, is [also] mistaken. That is a fact that we have to accept and of which we are proud, and we will not be able to renounce it in the future. The resistance is strong in Lebanon and the region, and will remain on the map in future – for, after all these years, this map must benefit the peoples of the region, from Palestine to Yemen."
The U.S. Has Begun To Accept Its Defeat In Syria Assad's Remaining In Power
Safi Al-Din's deputy 'Ali Da'mush addressed the situation in Syria in a July 20 Friday sermon. He said: "We are facing a new phase and a new move in Syria, which were imposed by the resistance, the confrontation, the sacrifices and the achievements on the ground. The Lebanese must know that any advance on the ground and any political progress made by the [Syrian] regime and its allies in their confrontation with the terror gangs in Syria will benefit Lebanon and its security and stability, and help the displaced Syrians to safely return to their land.
"The general state of the conflict in the region has shifted in favor of the resistance. There is a clear turnaround on the ground, as well as in the Syrian political arena. [True,] the military aggression of the multilateral terror [forces] against Syria yielded them important gains and achievements on the ground when [they managed to] control several cities and villages in Syria. But thanks to the steadfastness and sacrifice of the Syrian army and its allies over the recent years, the Syrian authorities have managed to regain control of every part of Syria, [and] the last area [to be recaptured] was southern Syria, up to the border with Jordan and with the [Israeli] Golan – and that is a great achievement. The region is experiencing a fundamental shift in the balance of power on the ground, in favor of the Syrian regime and its allies, and the armed terrorist gangs and their supporters are [experiencing] great losses and defeats on the ground.
"The [situation in the] political arena is no different from [the situation on] the battlefield. Comparing the demands that were made in the past with those that are being made today, [we find that] past negotiations spoke of an interim government [in Syria], and the U.S. demanded that Assad step down and play no future role [in the country], whereas today everyone agrees that Assad will stay in power. In its Helsinki talks with [Russia's] President Putin, the U.S. circumvented this issue, and it wasn't [even] mentioned... The talks there focused on the Iranian presence [in Syria], the security of the Zionist entity, and the role of the U.S. and its allies in a [future] settlement [in Syria]. The U.S. has begun to accept its defeat in Syria and [the fact that] the regime, with Assad as president, will remain – and that is a great political achievement, which comes on top of the ones in the field."

According to a tweet by WalkingCat, the Windows 10 build 16212 which Microsoft accidentally released a few days ago, doesn’t include the backup feature.
Specifically, the Twitter user notices that making new backups with File History is no longer supported. This could mean that Microsoft might be ready to completely remove the feature with the upcoming Fall Creators Update.
As mentioned above, the File History Backup Tool has been around since Windows 8. Microsoft introduced the feature with the famous OS back in 2012. File History allows users to backup incremental revisions of files and then restore them from a secondary storage device.
Of course, Microsoft updated File History in Windows 10. However, it seems like the company has something else in mind for backup once the Fall Creators Update drops.
New backup option and alternatives
Without a doubt, Microsoft will provide a backup option for Windows 10. Until the company confirms the removal of File History, users can still benefit from it.
As for the future, those in doubt can also create backups in Windows 10 using third-party software. There are a lot of options available for that, but it goes without saying that Microsoft will want to offer a built-in solution for Windows 10.
With the Windows 10 build 16212 already available due to an accidental release, it is possible we will have more information in this regard soon.
Dona Sarkar, head of the Windows Insider program, said that no new builds would be coming this week, so expect a new release in just a few days.Giro-26 wheel optionsOctober 29, 2012

William Shatner will be at the Kimmel Center’s Academy of Music on May 17 for a screening of the 1982 classic film, “Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan.”
In his seven decades on television, William Shatner has played many roles, but there is likely little doubt he lives in most of our memories as Captain James Kirk of the Starship Enterprise. Maybe to younger folks, it’s as the Priceline pitchman, but that's about as much acknowledgement this author will give to that.
In addition to his many years on “Star Trek,” Shatner is well known as T.J. Hooker, for hosting “Rescue: 911,” on “3rd Rock from the Sun,” “Boston Legal,” “$hit My Dad Says,” “Weird or What?” “Shatner’s Raw Nerve,” “Better Late Than Never,” “The Indian Detective” and much more.
He’s written numerous books, is a singer, producer, screenwriter and director and is still going strong at 87. And next week, Philadelphians will get a chance to see him, live on stage, and ask him anything they want.
On May 17, he’ll be at the Kimmel Center’s Academy of Music for a screening of the 1982 classic “Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan.”
The legendary star of stage and screen will share humorous behind-the-scenes stories from portraying the original Captain Kirk, and finish the evening with an audience-led Q&A session.
It was hard for Shatner to come up with one role his could identify as his “favorite” in 65-or-so years in acting, but he said that at his age, he was just happy to be able to “put one foot ahead of the other and keep [his] balance.”
“Being here and being able to think, create, say words and memorize and try and be halfway informative and amusing for this length of time – perhaps I should take pride in that, although I never think of myself as getting older, and every so often I think to myself, 'Am I dying?' and it turns out, I’m not,” he laughed.
He looked back fondly at the days of “Star Trek.”
“The show was very well written and executed, given our limited budget,” he said.
“We were high on good stories…It was a joy to play those roles week after week, and although not every show was extraordinary, there were some shows that sought to entertain, but also reminded you of a human truth.”
In 1968, in his role as Kirk, Shatner famously kissed his African-American co-star, Nichelle Nichols, (who played Lt. Uhura) during the episode “Plato’s Stepchildren.” At the time, it was widely considered the first instance of an interracial kiss on television. Some viewers in states along the Bible Belt wrote objection letters to Shatner, Nichols and NBC, but the majority of fan mail, according to Nichols, was supportive.
“It was just a kiss,” Shatner said.
“Apparently, at that time, given the circumstances surrounding our culture, there was a big deal made of it. For my part, it was only me performing with a very beautiful young lady, and it would have been a pleasure to kiss her in private as well as in public. So, to me, it wasn’t a big thing. Apparently, there were some TV stations in the south that didn’t play that particular hour. A big fuss was made of it then, but now, it’s meaningless, given the change in the way we view things.”
Shatner said he enjoyed a good relationship with many of his co-stars on "Star Trek." He had a particularly close friendship with Leonard Nimoy, who played Spock.
“Everybody you work with, mostly, become your best friends because you’re sharing a very dangerous thing. You’re exposing yourself to criticism, complaint and humiliation every time you go out there,” he said.
“You get more criticism than praise over the years. You become buddies in a foxhole, whether it’s with a female lead or a male lead."
Shatner said said he is very much looking forward to returning to the City of Brotherly Love, a place he’s frequented because his mother married a man from Philly after his father died.
“I have been to many cities, but Philadelphia is one of my favorites,” he mused.
“Philly is one of the greatest cities in the world, let alone in the United States, and it’s a theater-going city as well. One of my greatest memories is eating fish at Bookbinders.”Physicists from Dresden and Würzburg have developed a novel method for optical microscopy. Using biological motors and single quantum dots, they acquire ultra-high-resolution images.
The resolution of conventional optical microscopy is limited by the fundamental physical principle of diffraction to about one half of the wavelength of the light: If the distance between two objects is smaller than this so-called "diffraction limit", they can no longer be visually separated - their image appears "blurred ". To acquire optical images at the scale of few nanometers, this is clearly not sufficient.
Nano-probes migrate over surfaces
For this reason, scientists worldwide have developed elaborate concepts in the past in order to circumvent the diffraction limit and thus to increase the resolution. However, the technical effort needed to do so is considerable and usually highly specialized microscope assemblies are required.
In particular, the investigation of optical near fields still represents a great challenge, because they are so strongly localized that they cannot send waves to a distant detector.
In a new study, physicists from the Julius-Maximilians-Universität Würzburg (JMU) and the Technische Universität Dresden now show that it is possible to measure these near-fields with significantly less effort. They used a biomolecular transport system to slide many extremely small optical nano-probes over a surface. They present their results in the current issue of the renowned journal Nature Nanotechnology.
Intracellular molecules used as transport system
"As probes we used so-called quantum dots - small fluorescent particles a few nanometers in size," says Professor Bert Hecht, describing the physicists' approach. Hecht holds the Chair of Experimental Physics (Biophysics) at the JMU; and jointly supervised the project together with Professor Stefan Diez, Chairholder of BioNanoTools at the B CUBE - Center for Molecular Bioengineering at TU Dresden.
So-called motor proteins and microtubules make the quantum dots pass over the object to be examined. "These two elements are among the fundamental components of an intracellular transport system," explains Diez. "Microtubules are tubular protein complexes, up to several tenths of millimeters long, that form a major network of transport routes inside cells. Motor proteins run along these routes, transporting intracellular loads from one place to another," says the scientist.
Motor proteins provide the driving force
The physicists from Würzburg and Dresden took advantage of this concept, but in reverse order: "The motor proteins are fixed to the sample surface and pass the microtubules over them - a kind of 'stagediving' with biomolecules," says Heiko Groß, PhD student in the Hecht group. The quantum dots serving as optical probes are attached to the microtubules and move together with their carrier.
Since a single quantum dot would take a very long time to scan a large surface area, the researchers used large amounts of quantum dots and motor proteins which move at the same time and thus scan a large area in a short time. "Using this principle, we can measure local light fields over a large area with a resolution of less than five nanometers using a setup that resembles a classical optical microscope," explains the physicist. By comparison, one nanometer equals one millionth of a millimeter.
Test on a thin layer of gold
The physicists tested their method on a thin layer of gold with narrow slits less than 250 nanometers wide. These slots have been illuminated from below with blue laser light. "Light passing through these narrow gaps is limited to the gap width, making it ideal for demonstrating high-resolution optical microscopy," says Gross.
During the measurement, a "swarm of microtubules" simultaneously glides in different directions across the surface of the gold layer. Using a camera, the position of each transported quantum dot can be exactly determined at defined time intervals. If a quantum dot now moves through the optical near-field of a slit, it lights up more strongly and therefore acts as optical sensor. Since the diameter of the quantum dot is only a few nanometers, the light distribution within the slot can be determined extremely precisely, thus circumventing the diffraction limit.
Ten times higher accuracy
Another nice feature of this novel approach is that due to its length and strength a microtubule moves in an extremely straight and predictable fashion across the motor-coated sample surface. "This makes it possible to determine the position of the quantum dots ten times more accurately than with previously established high-resolution microscopy methods," explains Dr. med. Jens Ehrig, former postdoctoral fellow in the Diez group and current head of the "Molecular Imaging and Manipulation" facility at the Center for Molecular and Cellular Bioengineering (CMCB) of the TU Dresden. Furthermore, disturbances caused by artifacts due to near-field coupling can be excluded. Since the transport system consists of only a few molecules, its influence on the optical near fields is negligible.
The researchers hope to use their idea to establish a new technology in the field of surface microscopy. In any case, they are convinced that: "This type of microscopy can demonstrate its strengths, especially in the optical inspection of nanostructured surfaces." In a next step, they now want to use this molecular transport system to couple quantum dots to specifically prepared optical near field resonators to study their interaction.

Donating more than 25,000 toys, Disney VoluntEARS hope to spread cheer to Central Florida families this holiday season.
Don’t ask U.S. Marine Sgt. Robert Bacchus what his favorite toy is. For him, every doll, game, stuffed animal and play set is the best.
Sgt. Bacchus coordinates the Toys for Tots Programs for the U.S. Marine Corps around Orange, Osceola and Seminole counties, so every toy donated becomes his favorite. Each donated toy means he’s one step closer to providing a better holiday to some of Central Florida’s children.
Today, Disney VoluntEARS delivered more than 25,000 toys and gifts to surprise the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve as part of their annual Toys for Tots program. This year, the Marines have registered more than 30,000 children in Orange, Osceola and Seminole counties to receive a special gift from the program. The donated gifts will contribute to the campaign’s efforts to make sure every child as at least one gift with their name on it this holiday season.
“This has been a challenging year for Central Florida, and I’m inspired to see our community come together to take care of our youngest residents during the holiday season,” said Sgt. Bacchus. “We’re so grateful for the generosity of Disney Cast Members who have brought their own special kind of magic out to the warehouse today.”
In addition to donating gifts, Disney VoluntEARS have collectively given more than 3,000 hours of their time toward the cause. They’ve also helped clean and organize the warehouse, sort toys for distribution, and even assist with the distribution of toys and gifts to registered families.
“One of my favorite things about the holiday season is the spirit of giving and friendship, and I’m so humbled by the generosity of our Cast Members this year,” said Rena Langley, senior vice president of public affairs for Walt Disney World Resort. “We get to see our Cast Members make magic in our theme parks and resorts every day, and today we took that magic into the community.”
Disney has supported Toys for Tots from its beginning, since Walt Disney and his team of artists created the original red train logo for the organization in 1948. In the past 15 years, Walt Disney World Resort Cast Members have donated more than 400,000 toys to the program.
As a company with nearly 73,000 Cast Members in Central Florida, Walt Disney World Resort is committed to investing in the community in ways that directly improve the lives of Central Florida children and families.Zanna Roberts Rassi is the very fashionable editor of Marie Claire US.

Nintendo Switch: The Known Knowns, Known Unknowns and Unknown Unknowns
There is nothing in this industry that stimulates as many opinionated hot takes as Nintendo.
Covering Nintendo always feels a bit different to covering other companies. Of course, all brands – be they PlayStation, Xbox, Apple or Ouya… OK, maybe not ALL brands – have their advocates. It's impossible to compliment or criticise any of them without being accused of doing so through personal agenda, as opposed to through logic and reasoning.
Nintendo still stands above them all as the platform that enjoys the most loyal support. But we live in a universe where every action has an equal and opposite reaction, so for every Nintendo supporter who proudly wears the colours, there is another who wants to bring them down a peg. The result? A cacophony of social media hell.
The reaction to the Nintendo Switch unveiling last night was, judging by my Twitter feed at least, broadly positive. There was of course plenty of take my money” and I want it now” style exclamations, and they were joined by a pretty optimistic chorus of quiet compliments. Less positive, again broadly speaking, was the reaction from analysts. Switch does some cool stuff, certainly, but can it really appeal to an audience beyond the devoted?
So we're going full Rumsfeld in an effort to try and cut through the noise and have a look at what the Nintendo Switch represents and whether it can revive Nintendo's console fortunes at a time when the company's future is looking increasingly smartphone-shaped.
KNOWN KNOWNS
- THE DESIGN: The Nintendo Switch is a hybrid console designed for play in the home but also on the move. At home, the console unit – which is the device housed behind the screen – sits in a static dock, which outputs the video signal to a TV. Games can then be played either with the ‘J-Con' detachable controllers, of which there are two, or via a dedicated (and presumably separately purchased) controller. When going to the loo (or perhaps even venturing outside) owners can pluck the console from the dock, attach the controllers and use Switch like a sort of tablet, albeit one with physical controls. Said controllers can be detached at any time, and even shared among friends.
- LOCAL MULTIPLAYER: Perhaps the real champion here is the in-built local multiplayer. Local multiplayer has slowly become rarer in console gaming for a reason, but it's certainly true that among a portion of the fanbase at least, it's sorely missed. Playing online in blissful isolation may be fine for many, but there's no arguing that spanking someone sitting physically next to you – and getting all up in their face and maybe even punching them – is a richer experience. And this promise is at the heart of the Switch's USP.
- THE MESSAGE: Why was the Wii U such a flop? To say it was all down to the confused message is a vast over-simplification, but the messaging was certainly a huge problem – and one that the company looks to have addressed with Switch. Play on your sofa, take it with you to the bog. Simple and appealing. Where Switch looks at risk of veering into Wii U territory is with its controllers. They can be used with one in each hand. Or users can attach them both to a peripheral to fashion a sort of Saturn 3D Controller type hybrid. Or they can use an actual separate normal controller. Or, if they have exceptionally tiny hands, they can take one of the standard pair, turn it on its side and use that. If WiiMote compatibility is announced I might just die.
- THE INNARDS: Nvidia is supplying the machine's innards, marking an end to AMD's recent console monopoly. The architecture is a custom version of the Tegra chipset found in Nvidia's portable gaming tablet Shield.
- MARIO: Super Mario Switch is coming! Well, it might not be called that. Maybe this should have gone into the Known Unknowns list, but really the key thing here is that we're getting a new 3D Mario platformer. And a new Mario Kart, by the looks of it. Then of course, there's Zelda, which looks pretty damn delicious in its latest footage. It's a solid line-up that will guarantee day one sales among the faithful.
KNOWN UNKNOWNS
- PRICE: All too often, it's really all that matters. You can build the most amazing piece of tech in the history of all creation, but if people can't afford it, it counts for nowt. Should Switch launch for, say, 200, then Nintendo will be onto a winner. If it turns out to be closer to 300 or, god forbid, even more than that, Nintendo might face a stiff challenge convincing people that Switch really does offer something unique that isn't already ticked off by people's existing iPads, smartphones, handhelds, consoles and PCs.
- SPECS: Word on the street is that the portable screen is 720p, while 1080p is offered on the TV when Switch is docked. Now, the lack of 4K should worry no-one. It may be the current console buzzword but, really, we're years away from 4K mattering in big enough numbers to warrant serious consideration. People also seem to be readily accepting the rumoured 720p portable resolution, but honestly this does leave me concerned. Most smartphones pack far more pixels into far less real estate, and if Switch is instantly harsher on the eye than the device they already spend all day every day looking at, that's not great.
- BATTERY: Battery life is the other big question. The Wii U's portable battery life was poor, and Switch is going to need to at least cover a flight from Heathrow to New York – and possibly far more – if it wants to really establish itself as a portable machine.
- POWER: And that leads onto the next question. We don't know how powerful the custom Tegra chipset is, but if it's too powerful, then battery life is going to take a hit. If it's not powerful enough, however, it might not even be able to graphically compete with the leading smartphone titles, let alone consoles. Nintendo has confirmed that the home dock doesn't offer any additional computing power, but might it supercharge the Tegra to boost TV performance? Let's hope so, because a 720p portable gaming system could fall well short on the established graphical standards when viewed on your 40” LED flatscreen.
- TOUCHSCREEN: Speaking of screens, is the Switch's panel a touchscreen? For a device that wants to market itself as a properly portable tablet you'd hope so, but note that not once was anyone seen touching the screen in the teaser video. A lack of touchscreen would also kill the presumption that Switch will be compatible with Nintendo's smartphone games, too.
- STORAGE: We also need to know what Nintendo's storage plans are. This was an(other) area in which the Wii U fell desperately short. We know there's no disk drive, but what is the game card capacity? How much space will users have for downloads? Will there be an SD port? Two or three of those big Nintendo exclusives will soon eat into standard memory card sizes, certainly. Even a PS4 or Xbox One's 500GB HDD feels woefully inadequate in this day and age. Will the move away from discs and installations for physical games be enough to offset this, especially at a time when more and more people are going exclusively digital?
- ONLINE: Another issue is Nintendo's online infrastructure. The company has been playing catch up in this area for ages. A decent service that more closelyYou know summer is just around the corner when the Crana College 5k is coming up.

Christmas is the one holiday everyone who celebrates it cannot wait to arrive so they enjoy the things they love doing on this special day. This is the time friends and families exchange gifts and enjoy each other’s company. Christmas cards are the most bought gifts during this season. You find all kinds of cards. From animated Christmas cards to customized police Christmas cards. All of which will fit the occasion.
The holiday means so much in our lives that even schools close for a week or longer during this time. Even some businesses close for this holiday to give their employees time off to spend with their families. However, there are a lot of things we take for granted during this season that help make Christmas meaningful. Here are seven top things you want to remember even as you celebrate this year’s Christmas.
1. Christmas is for everyoneFor a holiday that is celebrated by over 2 billion people worldwide, Christmas holds a significant part in our lives whether or not we celebrate it. It has become a huge holiday that has been ingrained into the modern culture to the point that even the people from nations that did not previously recognize or celebrate this holiday are slowly easing up to it. With the number of people celebrating this festive holiday steadily rising. You do not have to be a Christian to celebrate Christmas as may already been evident above. Even the non-Christians share in on the holiday in their own special ways.
As the Christians prepare to celebrate the birth date of their Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, the non-Christians can opt for fun activities like ice skating, hiking, eating together, travelling, among other activities.
2. Commerce drives ChristmasChristmas is now more of a commercial and secular holiday than a religious one. It is easy to come to this conclusion if you see how our age recognize the holiday. It is the day shops will close while others open and make huge profits from the hike in sales of Christmas gifts and presents. Safe to say present and gift shops welcome this long-anticipated holiday with both arms. Not to forget the gift card shops and stores and industry which rake billions of dollars every year. Yes! This is the time to buy that police Christmas card we mentioned in the first paragraph. That is, if you know who you intend to send it to and still be meaningful to them.
There probably isn’t any other time of year that businesses and other commercial stores that deal in gifts make more sales and profits than in December. And if you need proof head out to the store and see for yourself the long ques of carts filled with all kinds of presents and gifts for the festive season.

Our first installment: Tzair Lanetzach (Forever Young) by Rami Kleinstein
adapted from Bob (Zimmerman) DylanDwayne "The Rock" Johnson clearly knows a good reboot when he sees one. Just days after word of a potential Jumanji remake starring Johnson and Kevin Hart started tickling everyone's fancy, the possible presidential candidate confirmed the project and announced that Jake Kasdan (Sex Tape, Orange County) had already agreed to handle directing duties.
"It's official," the prolific 'grammer of very necessary information revealed on Friday. "We'll produce and deliver to a whole new generation a title that I love and is one of my all time favs." Johnson says he's currently working on "edging up" an "already good" script with the rest of his Seven Bucks Productions team, the same team that brought us HBO's Ballers.
Hart and Johnson, however, have not been confirmed as starring in the reboot (yet). Don't worry though. Dude totally promised not to fumble this update of the 1995 classic starring the late Robin Williams, so we can hold him to that:
Johnson is already hard at work waving the hype flag for a very promising (and very R-rated) Baywatch reboot, a reboot that will now include the fan-approved presence of original series star Pamela Anderson. "A pleasure to welcome (as gorgeous as ever) Pamela Anderson to our Baywatch cast," Johnson 'grammed just hours before dropping the massive Jumanji news. "We couldn't have made this movie without you." Have we mentioned how much news gets broken via The Rock's Instagram yet? Seriously! The key to everything you could possibly ever need to know can, in some capacity, probably be found on this guy's Instagram.
We know you're busy with Jumanji and Baywatch (and adapting Rampage into a movie), Rock, but can we possibly get an R-rated Home Improvement reboot starring yourself and Kevin Hart? I'm not asking for a friend. I'm definitely asking for myself.Some water resources monitoring data are updated and available on either a "real time" basis or at relatively short time intervals.

You have to kind of learn as you go how to be in the right spot at the right time when you're heeling. Being aware of the type of cattle you're roping and the type of setup you're roping in is important, because it all changes if the steers are a little fresher or the chute is over toward the middle of the arena. A lot of factors come into play when you're deciding how much of a haze to give each steer. These finer details might not seem like a big deal when you start roping. But when you start trying to make money roping, you start looking at these little things a little more. Because all the little things added up become pretty important.
The more a steer has been roped, the harder it is to influence what he's going to do, because he has his pattern and he's not afraid of you. If you're in a situation where the roping chute is close to the right fence and the cattle have been roped quite a bit and want to get over to that fence, then it becomes harder to keep them straight. Those old steers will come right up against you. In that case, you might have to holler at them. If you aren't coming from behind a barrier, you might want to jump out there quicker so they react to you before they react to the header, and keep them pushed over there where you want them. This steer is trying me, and it's making it harder on David Key.
Your horse has to be broke enough to where you can maneuver him to get to the spot you need to get to in order to put that steer where you want him for your header. You need to have the option of doing what you need to do in each situation, whether that means jumping out there and being aggressive or hanging back a little. Sometimes that means working your horse in the box, with or without a steer, so he starts paying attention to you and what you're wanting on each run. Your horse has to be manageable and controllable, so you can do what you need to do.
Sometimes I'll ride my horse in and out of the box when there aren't any cattle loaded. I'll score him and make him break off of my hand. I hold onto him, then when I release him he breaks and runs. I isolate that without a header or a steer as part of his warm-up. I've seen some significant improvement after doing that. My horse listens to my hand so I have control of him. It's a communication process between you and your horse. A broke horse understands your communication.
You need to evaluate each scenario when deciding how much haze to give a steer. Consider the arena setup, type of cattle and what you're trying to accomplish. Then make a game plan on how you're going to haze the steer or if you don't want to haze him in that situation. When the arena is set up so the cattle want to go to the left, the heeler should keep himself out of the equation so you give your header a chance to make his catch on a straight-running steer. It's tricky, because you don't want to be late when that steer is turned, but you also don't want to mess up your header by pushing that steer too hard to the left.
If you know a steer wants to go hard to the right, your job is to get a great start and be out there in a position to hold that steer straight. In that case, you have to be totally aggressive so you don't get beat to the right and take the header out of position. A good head horse wants to be ready to turn the steer off, so a steer going to the right is a tough move for him. Everything's going away from the header, and the horse is wanting to stay ahead of things so he can take ahold of the steer and turn him off. A steer going to the right becomes one of the hardest shots, because the steer's getting further away from the header.
Talk to your partner. I'll tell my partner what I'm planning on doing, so he's on the same page and I don't surprise him. As a heeler, you want the steer turned for money. You're over there to help out. There are so many people who rope good these days that the heeler's start comes into play a lot. The more you work at these things, the better edge you have. And sometimes it's that little edge that's the deciding factor. STW" buttons

Of all of the facilities in the United States that provide addiction care, about one-third have developed specialized treatment programs just for women, according to the Alcohol and Drug Services Study. Facilities that provide this kind of specialized care are acknowledging that women have slightly different histories of drug abuse, and they also need slightly different care if they are to recover. These are the elements considered essential in any program that’s made just for women.
A Focus on Family
While many families in the United States take a gender-neutral stance in terms of parenting and childcare, women often define their role and their worth in terms of whom they help and care for. For women with addictions, a long history of drug abuse can keep them from developing healthy relationships with those around them, and the guilt about that lack of connection can work as a prompt that sparks a return to drug use.
Some women-centered programs keep family connections alive by providing on-site childcare, so a mother can bring her children with her to her sessions rather than searching for someone willing to watch over the children. But this isn’t the only option available that could help a woman with her family. Other worthwhile services might include parenting classes or family therapy. Some programs even offer outreach to community programs, so low-income addicted women can find safe places to live with their children and gain assistance with food and health care.
Any or all of these additional aspects could reduce the amount of stress a woman faces, and that might keep her from falling back into addiction when her treatment program is complete.
Mental Health Consideration
While anyone who abuses drugs might do so in response to underlying trauma, studies suggest that the link between prior trauma and addiction is especially strong in women. For example, in an article in The American Journal on Addictions, researchers suggest that 30 to 59 percent of women who abuse drugs have a co-occurring post-traumatic stress disorder. Often, this illness arises due to:
- Physical abuse during childhood
- Sexual assault during childhood
- Assault during adulthood
- Domestic violence
Programs made just for women must provide enhanced mental health capabilities, so these sources of pain can be explored and dealt with. Women who emerge from sensitive therapy programs like this have the tools they need to deal with their memories without leaning on drugs, and that might help them to avoid a relapse in the future.
Help for Women at The Oaks at La Paloma
At The Oaks at La Paloma, we’re sensitive to the needs of women with addictions. That’s why our programs are built on a foundation of family. We include family members in our treatment programs, as needed, and we always amend our treatment plans based on the progress our patients make under our care. Our Dual Diagnosis approach also allows us to address any mental illness that might be compounding an addiction problem, and we provide extensive follow-up care programs, so we can ensure that the gains made in therapy last for the long term. Please call us, and our admissions coordinators will be happy to tell you more about the healing we can provide at The Oaks at La Paloma.How to Find My Facebook Email Address

240 CasesHadoop Integration with R
In the beginning, big data and R were not natural friends. R programming requires that all objects be loaded into the main memory of a single machine. The limitations of this architecture are quickly realized when big data becomes a part of the equation.
In contrast, distributed file systems such as Hadoop are missing strong statistical techniques but are ideal for scaling complex operations and tasks. Vertical scaling solutions — requiring investment in costly supercomputing hardware — often cannot compete with the cost-value return offered by distributed, commodity hardware clusters.
To conform to the in-memory, single-machine limitations of the R language, data scientists often had to restrict analysis to only a subset of the available sample data. Prior to deeper integration with Hadoop, R language programmers offered a scale-out strategy for overcoming the in-memory challenges posed by large data sets on single machines.
This was achieved using message-passing systems and paging. This technique is able to facilitate work over data sets too large to store in main memory simultaneously; however, its low-level programming approach presents a steep learning curve for those unfamiliar with parallel programming paradigms.
Alternative approaches seek to integrate R’s statistical capabilities with Hadoop’s distributed clusters in two ways: interfacing with SQL query languages, and integration with Hadoop Streaming. With the former, the goal is to leverage existing SQL data warehousing platforms such as Hive and Pig. These schemas simplify Hadoop job programming using SQL-style statements in order to provide high-level programming for conducting statistical jobs over Hadoop data.
For programmers wishing to program MapReduce jobs in languages (including R) other than Java, a second option is to make use of Hadoop’s Streaming API. User-submitted MapReduce jobs undergo data transformations with the assistance of UNIX standard streams and serialization, guaranteeing Java-compliant input to Hadoop — regardless of the language originally inputted by the programmer.
Developers continue to explore various strategies to leverage the distributed computation capability of MapReduce and the almost limitless storage capacity of HDFS in ways that can be exploited by R.
Integration of Hadoop with R is ongoing, with offerings available from IBM (Big R as part of BigInsights) and Revolution Analytics (Revolution R Enterprise). Bridging solutions that integrate high-level programming and querying languages with Hadoop, such as RHive and RHadoop, are also available.
Fundamentally, each system aims to deliver the deep analytical capabilities of the R language to much larger sets of data.
RHive
The RHive framework serves as a bridge between the R language and Hive. RHive delivers the rich statisticaled using Hive.
RHadoop
Another open source framework available to R programmers is RHadoop, a collection of packages intended to help manage the distribution and analysis of data with Hadoop. Three packages of note — rmr2, rhdfs, and rhbase — provide most of RHadoop’s functionality:
rmr2: The rmr2 package supports translation of the R language into Hadoop-compliant MapReduce jobs (producing efficient, low-level MapReduce code from higher-level R code).
rhdfs: The rhdfs package provides an R language API for file management over HDFS stores. Using rhdfs, users can read from HDFS stores to an R data frame (matrix), and similarly write data from these R matrices back into HDFS storage.
rhbase: rhbase packages provide an R language API as well, but their goal in life is to deal with database management for HBase stores, rather than HDFS files.
Revolution R
Revolution R (by Revolution Analytics) is a commercial R offering with support for R integration on Hadoop distributed systems. Revolution R promises to deliver improved performance, functionality, and usability for R on Hadoop. To provide deep analytics akin to R, Revolution R makes use of the company’s ScaleR library — a collection of statistical analysis algorithms developed specifically for enterprise-scale big data collections.
ScaleR aims to deliver fast execution of R program code on Hadoop clusters, allowing the R developer to focus exclusively on their statistical algorithms and not on MapReduce. Furthermore, it handles numerous analytics tasks, such as data preparation, visualization, and statistical tests.
IBM BigInsights Big R
Big R offers end-to-end integration between R and IBM’s Hadoop offering, BigInsights, enabling R developers to analyze Hadoop data. The aim is to exploit R’s programming syntax and coding paradigms, while ensuring that the data operated upon stays in HDFS. R datatypes serve as proxies to these data stores, which means R developers don’t need to think about low-level MapReduce constructs or any Hadoop-specific scripting languages (like Pig).
BigInsights Big R technology supports multiple data sources — including flat files, HBase, and Hive storage formats — while providing parallel and partitioned execution of R code across the Hadoop cluster. It hides many of the complexities in the underlying HDFS and MapReduce frameworks, allowing Big R functions to perform comprehensive data analytics — on both structured and unstructured data.
Finally, the scalability of Big R’s statistical engine allows R developers to make use of both pre-defined statistical techniques, as well as author new algorithms themselves.Digital marketing is a fast-paced industry where it seems like things are changing on nearly a daily basis. Additionally, it can be hard to learn up to the minute information in an educational environment. That means that getting started in the field can be an extremely daunting task. One of the best ways to break onto the scene is to make connections with those who know the industry and who are actively working in it.
Engaging a CMO (Chief Marketing Officer) in meaningful conversation (not just asking for a job) is an excellent way to learn more from the front lines. However, taking the plunge to begin chatting with a knowledgeable expert is a big step. Being prepared for this type of encounter can help you turn a simple chat into a conversation that could open doors! So, what should you do if you have the opportunity to chat with a digital marketing guru at a conference or other event? Consider these steps.
#1 Understand Digital Marketing Terminology – Take some time now to study your digital marketing speak so you can keep up with the experts in conversation. (Tweet this) To the uninitiated, it could seem like a conversation about digital marketing is spoken in a completely different language. This glossary is a great place to start your education.
#2 Ask Non-Threatening Questions – Keep your questions friendly so the CMO understands you are truly interested in his or her knowledge—not in his or her ability to help you get a job. Two types of questions, you may want to ask include:
- Organizational Learning Questions – These questions include those about the marketing program of the company as a whole. It could include questions about the company’s culture, competitors, and potential future changes.
- Digital Strategy Learning Questions – This includes questions about lead building, customer retention, distributing digital content or content marketing. Showing an interest in how the CMO accomplishes these important tasks will make him, or her open up about the job as a whole.
#3 Dig Deeper – Don't just stop with one question—ask three follow-up questions to gain a better understanding of the particular subject. For instance: If you asked a question about an organization’s content marketing program and you found out the company utilized a blogging program you might follow up and ask “Why do you use a blog?” “Why blogging instead of article marketing?” “Why are you planning to expand your blogging program?” Another alternative is to ask the CMO to tell you more. For instance: “Tell me more about how you integrate blogging with social media.”
"Tell me more" - 3 fantastic words to unearth deeper insights. (Tweet this)
#4 Leave the Door Open – When you feel the conversation winding down, do not let it end without finding a way to leave the door open to further communications. Ask if you can connect on LinkedIn or indicate an interest in following his or her work on Twitter or the company blog. This opens the door and allows you to engage with the CMO down the road if you should have a need. (Tweet this)
While it can be a bit nerve-wracking to approach that CMO, the benefits are well worth a few minutes of sweaty palms.
Prepare yourself for this big day and get ready to make a connection that could turn into something incredible.

In the 1800s, Royal Institution professors were the first to identify 10 chemical elements. Today there are 118 in our current periodic table. But how did the likes of Humphry Davy discover elements in the early 19th Century? In the 20th Century, after all the naturally occurring elements had been identified, how have scientists created new superheavy elements? And are there more elements to be created? Join writer Philip Ball, historian Frank James and nuclear chemist Christoph Düllmann to celebrate International Year of the Periodic Table.
Frank James is Professor of the History of Science and Head of Collections at the Royal Institution.
He, such as the military, art (where he co-authored a book on the scientific and technological content of paintings in the National Gallery), religion and technology..
Christoph E. Düllmann is Professor of Nuclear Chemistry at Johannes Gutenberg University (JGU) Mainz and head of the research sections on Superheavy Element Chemistry at GSI Helmholtzzentrum Darmstadt and Helmholtz Institute Mainz (HIM), Germany.
He studied chemistry at University of Bern, Switzerland, where he received his PhD for the first chemical study of element 108, hassium. He then spent about three years at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and UC Berkeley, CA, USA, to establish methods to study novel compound classes of the superheavy elements, before joining GSI Darmstadt. Since 2010, he holds a joint professorship at JGU Mainz and GSI Darmstadt.
In 2015/16, he was visiting scientist at Australian National University, Canberra, Australia, to study processes governing the successful synthesis of heaviest elements.
His main research activities include the production of superheavy elements and their nuclear stability, as well as the gas phase chemical study of these elements and their compounds.

GDP Growth has grown year on year at an average at 10.5%, this can be seen through the whole culture in China, primarily through the language. Unlike us English speakers, there is no messing around with the Chinese language, everything is direct, everything is logical. There is no room for ‘likes’ or ‘maybes’- or either are or you are not.
Secondly the speed can be seen through production- when I first got my place in China there was a petrol station being built- at that time it barely had the roof on, and my friend said that production was started 2 weeks before. Today when I walked past it, it is almost finished with only final finishing touches to be done. If we were in England that would takes months of planning. When you look around Zhuhai you realize this- that 25 years ago there was nothing- and now look at it:
Finally this can be seen through the eating habits- some people may think that the Chinese people have bad eating habits- I do not believe this- it is just another illustration of the extreme time efficiency in China.Above: From my mantel arrangement: crystal lily votive candle holder and mantel clock, and plate holder.
Hello Ladies,
Today I will try to adequately answer a question that was posed to me regarding the content of this blog:
Dear Lydia,
I like reading your blog because I am looking for teaching on what I might do to carry out my responsibilities at home. However, I notice you write about many other subjects that do not seem to be related to those subjects. Also it does not appear that you use scripture in every post, do not often approach the subject of marriage or child rearing, or that you do not major in winning souls. I see mostly, sewing, decorating, travel, garden and tea parties. Yet, you claim this is a Titus 2 blog. Can you explain this?
Signed: Wife, Mother, Homemaker
My Answer:
Dear WMH,
Thank you for your viewership and your comment. This is a log on the different aspects of life at home for me, and not necessarily everyone else. In the life of any lady at home, there will be many different things that happen, not just washing dishes or doing laundry. It is not only about one thing. In a marriage, people do many different things as a team to keep the house safe and secure, and they do things for other people too. It is about a whole life, not just isolated parts of it.
Also I think there is "teaching" in the way we live, the things we do, and the and the way we present ourselves visually, and the things we say. This blog has to cover many different aspects of home life, because what it is all about is what you would do in life itself, not marriage or child rearing alone. We did many different things with our children, and our marriage is shown not just by what we believe about it but about the way we interact.
I show pictures of my own house because then I do not have to go to the trouble to find out if I've taken a copyrighted photo, and it also shares what I might be doing in a room. I'm quite keen on keeping the decor interesting and fresh because it makes the home a happy and interesting place. While my children were growing up I wanted them to experience the refining touches and art, in the home. I will also be posting the answer to a question about home interiors soon.
My husband has been an evangelist for the Lord's church for over 50 years, and my life has been surrounded by soul winning sermons and teaching, and church things. We are involved in Bible studies throughout the week, including the regular Ladies Bible Class of the church here in the Manse. We are saturated in instruction, Bible studies and hospitality and fellowship in the church, therefore, I use this blog as an outlet for other interests I have, which of course, always embody the life of a Christian woman.
This little blog is a content of some of my own interests, and not a soul-winning blog or a marriage blog or a child rearing blog, but it represents all the things in life you would experience as a wife, mother and homemaker. I find relaxation and reprieve in the kitchen and sewing room and I like to keep the decor interesting, even though I'm not pushing those things for everyone. I'm just sharing some of the aspects of my life, as most bloggers do.
I have many excellent sources for Bible study on the sidebar, and will be adding some on marriage that I think are scripturally sound. Because of all that we do in the Bible teaching area, I prefer to use my blog for the other interests I have. However, I try to make the subjects relevant to home living. Also, I was a homeschooler, and learned to observe things and research them, such as the tow paths, the canals, and other geography. I like some history and some word meanings as well as Koine Greek, which Mr. S. and I once took studies in. I am also interested in nature's health benefits. So I share all aspects of life..
The crystal lily votive candle holder can be found at Goodwill or TJ Maxx.

Lydia,
What you do is show a well rounded life in Christ. There is a lot of life that goes on outside the doors of a church. As you said, Bible Study, fellowship and services happen all week long. It was wonderful to read about your driving adventures with Mr S, and to see the beauty of this country.
A.
Ann, You get the award for being the first to comment; and also "loyal fan" ;-)
My two cents.
Homemakers interests have many asepts of working with many hats. Homemakers don't wear just one, but one of several as they indeed have to change out daily, if not hourly at times. I don't know how they do it as I had that pleasure of having that experience one time when my bride had gone to visit her mother a few days after a serious surgery and me with all the kids to homeschool, fix meals, clean house, and make phone calls or appointments. I had never been so HAPPY to see my wife walk back through that door! I shared with her my misunderstanding of her role in the home and how much she does in a single day! Just because I find her sitting in a chair when I get home does not mean she sat there all day. She is a busy lady and her smile cheers me at times when I come home tired and beaten down after a hard days work.
t
Peacock Man's comment is really good...a wise man. And your answer too, Lydia, is also good.
Dear Lady Lydia,
Re: the posts that do not mention the LORD: they remind me of the book of Esther - God may not be mentioned, but he is always present, showing in the fruits of the spirit that come through in your life.
Adelaide
Lydia,
Your blog is precious and so are you and your readers. Wonderful answers and blog material.
Thank you much!!�� Donna
Also Love the flower candle 💕
The flower candle is available at TJ MAXX or HomeGoods throughout the country. I got mine at a thrift store, Goodwill, I think. Some people don't want too much of this stuff, to dust and move around, it. I have to be careful myself but I like to enjoy it now. You might be able to see one online by typing in crystal (and the name of the flower. I can't think of it right now. It is like a lily, that floats in a lake) candle holder.
I enjoy your reading your blog because of the beauty I see in the pictures you post. I also enjoy the homemaking encouragement you give. While I am a Christian, I don't come here to read anything pertaining to theology. As a Christian who believes in Reformed theology, I am well fed through my church, and other blogs, and appreciate the fact that your blog focuses on the homemaking aspect. I am a divorced (his choice) older empty nester who works full time.
Another thing, though not related to this post but another one. I work in retail at the Customer Service desk and appreciated your words to be kind to cashiers.
My husband and sons are preachers; I don't want to preach on this blog. I think everyone can see it is written from the viewpoint of a Christian woman, and when I can, I include scripture for what I do. This isn't a Bible study but you can click on some of the links I have on the sidebar for Bible topics.
Fox and Jacobs is now Centex, I think. But I would like to see pictures of some interiors from the 1980's because it was so delightful.
Another tour you might take is of the nearest Ronald MacDonald house, which is much like those homes. Perhaps if you offered a donation, they would let you tour the home.
I would encourage the woman to go back and read all of your posts from the beginning. I like to do that too from time to time. I feel that so many wonderful topics have already been covered and continue to be. This blog has been such a treasure in my life. I began reading it when I was younger and first became a stay-at-home mother and it has always been a source of gentle teaching and encouragement to me. Lydia, you are an experienced, knowledgeable, confident homemaker in a world where so many younger women need that. This blog is a gem.Express. Home of the Daily and Sunday Express.
Cristiano Ronaldo: When will Juventus star make his debut? FULL Serie A fixtures revealed
CRISTIANO RONALDO completed a blockbuster transfer to Juventus from Real Madrid earlier this month, but when will he make his debut for the Italian giants?

Juventus completed the shock deal of the summer by signing Ronaldo in a deal worth £88million.
It brought an end to the Portugal international’s nine-year spell in Madrid where he won two La Liga titles, four Champions League winner’s medals and also picked up four Ballon d’Or trophies.
He will now embark on a new venture to try and conquer Serie A with the reigning Italian champions, with an eye on helping them win their first European title since 1996.
The 33-year-old is currently on a summer break after his exploits at the 2018 World Cup with Portugal, meaning he won’t be involved in any of Juventus’ matches in the International Champions Cup.
Instead, his first outing in a Juventus kit could come in their final pre-season friendly against Villar Perosa on August 12 but when could he make his official debut?

Come run with the pack - RETRIEVER!!Back in May of 2003, Captain Kujo received a call that took him on a quest for history, for renewal, and for knowledge. As a member of the Submerged Cultural Resource Unit within the National Parks Service, the Captain has had many opportunities in the past to dive some of the richest cultural sites in the country. Lake Powell. Lake Mead. The Amistad. Dry Tortugas. The Everglades. You name the place, and the Captain has probably been there with his dry suit on. This time it was the folks at the USS Arizona Memorial in Hawaii who made the call.
Oil Leaks from the USS Arizona
Ever since the ship was sunk in the Pearl Harbor attack in 1941, oil has been leaking from the USS Arizona. For the longest time, until the 1980s in fact, nothing was done about it. But as times changed and as people became more conscious of the environment, efforts began to examine the leaks with the ultimate goal to put an end to them. But first they had to study what was going on, find out where the oil was coming from and how much of it was leaking per day.
That’s where the Captain came in.
“They wanted me to build a unit that could trap the oil as it leaked from the ship,” says the Captain. “I put together a nylon structure that had a wetsuit sleeve at the end of it. When submerged, the whole thing stood up like a tent so it could capture the oil for further inspection.”
Thanks to the Captain’s work, they now know that the Arizona is leaking from 2 to 9 quarts of oil each day, depending on conditions.
Poignant Experience
The Captain didn’t just go straight to the ship and start diving. He first went through the whole memorial experience on the beach, and then took the solemn boat ride to the monument on the water. “You could tell you were at a cemetery,” he said. “You get the sense of the sacredness of the place. It’s hallowed ground.”
To this day, the USS Arizona houses over 1100 sailors and marines who were killed in the massive explosion that sunk the ship. The site is also an active cemetery. Veterans who served on the ship and survived the attack have the option to be buried there after they pass. Some survivors have their ashes spread over the water. Some choose to have their cremains taken under water by Navy divers to be placed in the ship’s gun turret #4.
It’s a touching reminder of the horrors of war, and the unthinkable sacrifice that the men and women of the US military made to give us the freedoms we hold dear.
The Captain says he was honored to be a part of the exploratory mission in 2003 and still holds a certain amount of satisfaction knowing that his efforts aided to solve at least a small puzzle in relation to the USS Arizona. The Captain and USIA are always ready to help, because, as we say, it’s not just equipment, it’s a lifestyle.

But still less recognized is its cousin Brancamenta. It’s got Fernet’s intense bitter kick, but an even stronger mint flavor that manages to dominate — we’re talking mouthwash levels of minty-powerful. It’s an intense elixir that’s certainly polarizing, but those who love Brancamenta tend to really love Brancamenta. Our recommendation? Try it in one of these three simple cocktails, where you’ll really appreciate its minty character.
Easy: Menta & Soda
Like making a mint soda, but much, much easier — just lighten up Brancamenta with a whole lot of sparkling water. A few sprigs of mint ups the fresh herbal flavor while slightly camouflaging its more bitter aspects.
Instructions: In a tall glass with ice, combine an ounce and a half of Brancamenta and four ounces of club soda. Stir briefly and garnish with two mint sprigs, lightly slapping them on your palm beforehand to release their aroma.
Related: There's More Than One Kind of Fernet in the World
Intermediate: Bourbon & Mint
Anyone who’s ever sipped a julep knows that mint and bourbon are a great pair. Here, we’re adding lemon and sugar for a pleasantly refreshing cocktail that gets its body and weight from the whiskey, but still delivers on the clean, crisp mint flavor.
Instructions: In a cocktail shaker with ice, combine one and a half ounces of bourbon, one ounce of Brancamenta, a quarter-ounce lemon juice, and a quarter-ounce simple syrup. Shake until well-chilled, then strain into a rocks glass with fresh ice. Garnish with a lemon wedge.

Advanced: Menta Mojito
How could you taste a super-minty liqueur and not contemplate putting it in a mojito? Mint, rum, and lime are a great combination — but mojitos can be pretty messy to make, with all that pounded-up mint, which gets bitter if muddled too hard and gets stuck in your teeth unless you double-strain. Swapping in Brancamenta saves you the trouble, while a mint sprig garnish brings that fresh herbal vibrancy back in.
Instructions: In a cocktail shaker with ice, combine one and a half ounces of white rum, 3/4 ounce of Brancamenta, 3/4 ounce of lime juice, and a quarter-ounce simple syrup. Shake until well-chilled, then strain into a tall glass with fresh ice. Top with two ounces of soda. Garnish with a mint sprig and a lime wedge.

The ad shows the familiar Pac-Man maze, though this time it is Hillary’s head gobbling up emails instead of the familiar white dots. The ghosts have been replaced with sunglass-wearing FBI agents.
As Clinton rounds the maze eating the emails, a ticker at the bottom tracking ‘Emails Deleted’ increases.
“Crooked Hillary is a lot like Ms. Pac-Man — she’ll keep going and going and going until she’s cornered and caught!” Trump wrote on Facebook above the video.
The video has been viewed over 2,300,000 times.
Trump has repeatedly gone after Clinton over the email scandal she has been embroiled in during her run up to the Democratic nomination.

But he also said there was no evidence anyone willfully or intentionally mishandled classified information and that “no reasonable prosecutor” would pursue such a case.

Plans to demolish the Wakefield Market Hall buildings in northern England, built by British architect David Adjaye just 10 years ago, have been approved.
After four years of uncertainty, the Yorkshire city’s council has announced that the market hall buildings will be torn down, but that the large canopy that covers the buildings will remain.
“Wakefield Council’s cabinet gave the go ahead for the demolition of the market hall at a meeting on July 10,” said a statement from the council.
“The decision is enabling council officers to be able to discuss a proper timescale for demolition and to prepare for the closure.”
The council first announced its plans to sell the site to a developer in 2014. The original plans were to demolish the entire structure and replace it with a cinema.
The council has now allocated £300,000 of funding to demolish the buildings, but not the canopy.
The latest proposals for the site, which were designed by Leslie Jones Architectureand approved in 2017, incorporate the canopy into a nine-screen cinema and restaurant complex operated by The Light Cinema brand.
Completed in 2008, the 4,000-square-metre market was the first public building designed by David Adjaye.
But it struggled to attract the visitors needed to make it commercially viable, leading to it being heavily subsidised by the council.
Since initial plans to demolish the market hall were announced, the vast majority of traders have left. Only four traders currently use the facility.
“The council has already helped the majority of traders to move on from the market hall and this dedicated support will continue to be offered to the remaining four traders who will be affected,” said the council.
Although the developer was granted planning permission for the cinema last year, it has not yet purchased the site. The council believe that paying for demolition will set a timescale for the closure and redevelopment of the new building.
“Funding the demolition means we can move forward to work with traders and agree the timeframe for closure, which we expect will be sometime in the new year, as well as giving businesses the assurance they want,” said Denise Jeffery, cabinet member for regeneration and economic.
Adjaye, who ranked 13 on the latest Dezeen Hot List, is one of the UK’s best known architects, with high-profile projects all around the world.
He recently completed the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture, and is currently working the Latvian Museum of Contemporary Art in Riga and a new cathedral in Ghanaian capital Accra.
He declined to comment on the future of the Wakefield Market Hall.
Photography is by Lyndon Douglas.For the quintessentially traditional Roman Catholic wedding, you cannot go wrong with the Cathedral Santuario. The Victorian Gothic architecture is evident all around the building. Attention to detail accentuates all aspects of the artistry. Not surprisingly, it is a favorite location for wedding photographers in Dallas, TX.
Couples love the time-honored shots they can request. A good example is the newly married husband and wife descending the stairs that lead from the interior to the street. Friends and family members who wish them well and take photos flank them. The photographer is at the bottom, getting pictures of their movements and the actions of the crowds. He ensures that the gorgeous architecture of the venue serves as the ideal backdrop.
Nobody is paying any attention to the professional, which is ideal. Everyone’s focus is on the bride and groom. In the years to come, they will remember the moment they emerged from the cathedral. They recall what they were thinking about as a newly married couple. Maybe they were joking with each other and their well-wishers. This kind of photo is the ideal catalyst to get them talking.

One August jackpot winner never claimed his/her prize – $31 million won in New York on August 1, 2006."
The jackpot will reset to $15 million for the next drawing on Tuesday, August 15.

Place Category: Community Group
The Chamberlains Park Action Committee (CPAC) was formed on April 24, 2008 to continue and expand on the work done by previous committees dating back to 1999 when Irving Oil Limited donated a sixteen acre parcel of land to the Town of Conception Bay South to be developed as a park.
The mission of CPAC is to develop, maintain, and preserve the Chamberlains Park Site to provide a unique, natural, educational area that is universally accessible.
CPAC and its members are dedicated to promoting this vision and desire to partner with community organizations and businesses to develop the site for the use of present and future generations.
The main trail through the park has been rough cut and widened. With assistance from the Town of Conception Bay South, the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador, the Green Team, and Queen Elizabeth 2562 Army Cadet Corp, CPAC has been able to complete about six hundred feet of trail including gravel and boardwalk sections. The main trail will be a one kilometer, fully accessible loop upon completion and will include hard packed gravel sections, boardwalk, bridges, and sidewalk.
The general public can take ownership of Chamberlains Park by donating twenty dollars per foot of trail or by dropping off recyclables marked for Chamberlains Park Action Committee at the Green Depot. CPAC is a registered non-profit organization.Software Engineer (FrontEnd/FullStack) ebay

I am working on all new garden ideas for the landscape around our 1956 fixer upper and have collected some ideas from fellow bloggers. There's room for you to add your garden posts too. The neglected gardens have been saving some surprises for me that I didn't expect after nearly 15 years untended. First a Wisteria bloomed, then lots of iris in an array of colors some honey suckle, trumpet vine and a just a few days ago some volunteer petunia's showed up.
I have been clearing out the many flower beds and replanting where only grass grows. I added some knock out roses and Russian Sage where a few cane roses have survived then tossed several wild flower and butterfly flower mixed seed packets liberally along the front of the property. With all the unusual rains this year I have quite a showy area near the highway.
I also started a dry river bed along the front porch where the drip line from the roof washes away seedlings. Along the edge there are lots of zinnia and marigolds getting ready to bloom. On the other side of the side walk I extended the dry bed to weave behind some shrubs all the way to the end of the house. I used black and red mulch to hold moisture and help control the weeds in front of that. The perennials I planted include sage, rosemary, lavender, mums, and some wild flowers.
Now you've toured my new gardens, take a look at some more great ideas linked below. I hope you have some garden posts or Instagram photos of your garden to share too.

LOL! I read it twice before I "got it".Brian R. Kenyon
Once a year, one Tuesday is known in some parts of the country as “Fat Tuesday.” A preacher from Florida learned about this day through an interesting experience. Several years ago, he and his family lived in Louisiana, along the banks of the Bayou Teche. One Wednesday night, he stopped by the grocery store as he often did on the way home from midweek Bible study. As he was waiting in line to check out, he saw an acquaintance, who had a black smudge across his forehead. The preacher debated within himself whether he should say something or just let it slide. Finally, he put himself in the place of his acquaintance, figuring “whatever you want men to do to you, do also to them” (Matthew 7:12), and determined to say something. The preacher said, “Excuse me, sir, you seemed to have brushed up against something dirty that left a spot on your forehead.” The older man answered angrily, “Don’t you know this is Ash Wednesday?” The preacher thought, “Ash Wednesday, what in the world is that?” Then, he investigated.
Ash Wednesday:
Immediately Follows Fat Tuesday
As the preacher investigated, he learned that, according to Roman Catholic tradition, “Ash Wednesday” is the day that “Lent” begins. “Lent” is a forty-day period of “penitence and restraint” on bodily appetites that ends at the beginning of “Easter week.” It turns out that in the case of the preacher’s acquaintance, the Roman Catholic priest had to smear ashes, a sign of remorse and penitence, on the foreheads of his parishioners for them to be blessed in their observance of “Lent.” The idea behind “Fat Tuesday” (better known as Mardi Gras) is to splurge the day before one begins the forty-day period of “penitence and restraint.” Thus, the celebration on Tuesday often involves all-out gluttony, whether in the form of uncontrolled feasting, drunkenness or sexual promiscuity. “Fat Tuesday” is another example of how false religion can influence entire generations to fulfill the lusts of the flesh, all in “good conscience.” This is not to say that everything associated with present day Mardi Gras is sinful. There are cultural activities involved that are not sinful. However, many in this world still live by the fleshly gratifying Mardi Gras philosophy.
A Period of Penitence and Restraint?
The forty days of “Lent” being set apart as an obligated period of “penitence and restraint” is wrong for at least two reasons. First, it implies that practicing self-control is not as important at other times of the year. Such, however, could not be further from the truth. True religion teaches that self-control is to be a way of life. Peter wrote, “But also for this very reason, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue, to virtue knowledge, to knowledge self-control, to self-control perseverance, to perseverance godliness, to godliness brotherly kindness, and to brotherly kindness love” (2 Peter 1:5-7). Each of these “Christian graces” is a necessary element that all Christians must possess and in which all Christians must grow throughout their lives (2 Peter 3:18). The word “self-control [“temperance” KJV]” means to master or restrain self. Self-control is always to be practiced, not just during a forty-day period in the year! Also note that among the “fruit of the Spirit” is “self-control [“temperance” KJV]” (Galatians 5:23). Again, the “fruit of the Spirit” is to be produced all year, not just during a forty-day period. Self-control must always be a lifelong practice!
Second, “Lent” is a manmade substitution. By what authority do we reduce God’s instructions for a life of self-control to only a forty-day period per year? Paul addressed manmade substitution for God’s instruction: three “do nots” were not a reference to smoking or chewing tobacco, but they were part of a philosophy later known as asceticism, which taught the more one denied his flesh, the more spiritual he was. This same philosophy bred the monastic system of the Middle Ages, where “monks” would seclude themselves in monasteries. Some would literally starve themselves, poke out their eyes and cut off their hands, thinking this made them more spiritual. Paul called this foolishness “self-imposed religion…false humility, and neglect of the body”! There is no substitute for converting the mind and “bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ” (2 Corinthians 10:5)!
God Does Not Give License to Sin
The idea that it is acceptable to uncontrollably let ourselves go in fulfilling every desire of the flesh because we are about to enter a forty-day period of “penitence and restraint” flies in the face of our Lord’s will. Our minds should never be focused on the lusts of the flesh (Romans 8:5-8). Rather, our sights should be set on the “things of the Spirit” (Matthew 6:33; Colossians 3:1-2). Given the idea behind “Fat Tuesday” (Mardi Gras), it should be no surprise that many sins are encouraged and committed during this time. However, Paul still says, “do not use liberty as an opportunity for the flesh” (Galatians 5:13). Peter still says that we must not use our liberty as a “cloak for vice [“maliciousness” KJV]” (1 Peter 2:16). It is never right to do wrong (Romans 3:8)!
Conclusion
As with Christmas and other holidays, it is not inherently sinful to participate in the cultural, non-religious aspects of Mardi Gras (as long as those aspects do not violate God’s will), such as parades, throwing and catching beads, eating “king cakes,” etc., but it is always sinful to live by the lusts of the flesh, even for a day (Romans 6:1-2; 1 John 2:15-17). Let us not think we must “sow wild oats” before we can serve God and sow the Gospel seed.Niklas Quetri

PagesYou woke up with an angry pimple. From every angle, it’s practically staring at you in the face in the mirror. You want to get rid of it, now. The first thing you should avoid is trying to pop that sucker yourself, because this can make the pimple even worse than it looks now. Instead, treat it with medicines that get at the heart of why it’s there in the first place, advises Joshua Zeichner, MD, the Director of Cosmetic & Clinical Research in Dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City.
Next time you’re lamenting your zit fate, try these six products to chase it off your face for good.
With 2.5 percent benzoyl peroxide, this product contains just the right amount to reduce the bacteria present in pores that causes pimple eruptions—all without being too harsh and triggering irritation. Dr. Zeichner cautions that benzoyl peroxide can bleach fabrics, so protect your pillowcases if you go to bed after applying it.
You guessed it: 2.5 percent benzoyl peroxide stops P. acnes bacteria to address everything from larger pimples to a whitehead or two. With very few ingredients for a skincare product (there’s only five, one of which is water) and fragrance-free, you can feel confident using it even if you have sensitive skin.
This product is a classic for a reason—and if you stopped using it when you were a teen, it’s time to bring it back in your arsenal. It’s expertly formulated with 2 percent salicylic acid to exfoliate and sop up pore-plugging excess oil. You’ll love this one because the tipped applicator makes it super simple to target the pimple and apply it precisely to the spot.
Just what you’re looking for: 2 percent salicylic acid to clear out those pores, along with oat extract to ease redness and soothe. Witch hazel has also been added for more oil-busting benefits. The gel dries clear and won’t peel off, so it’s ideal to dab a thin amount under makeup and go about your day.
We admit, it’s certainly not fancy, but sometimes the simple things are the best. This topical corticosteroid cream with 1 percent hydrocortisone helps quickly soothe the enraged spot and reduce redness. Petrolatum, glycerin, and mineral oil offer an infusion of hydration to combat the dryness that commonly happens with spot treatments.
Along with the right amount of inflammation-reducing hydrocortisone, this adds chamomile, antioxidants, and vitamins A, C, and E, so it can also help calm, moisturize, and generally help your skin feel more comfortable throughout the treatment. And, since hydrocortisone is an expert multitasking ingredient, you can keep what’s leftover to treat irritation or itchiness in the future.

In a stroke of luck so wide it could only have been made with an industrial roller I was asked if I wanted to attend one of a series of speeches given by Kevin Ryan and Brian Kehew who wrote the critically acclaimed book Recording The Beatles.
At first I thought it was some kind of sick joke. For a boy who grew up listening to Magical Mystery Tour and Sgt Peppers rather than nursery rhymes, who learnt With A Little Help From My Friends on piano while everyone else was off playing football, who once said anyone who doesn’t like The Beatles is inherently evil, it is basically the dream assignment. After standing about drooling for five to ten minutes I accepted the challenge and attended the talk.
The lecture covered the full history of the studio, from its days under EMI as His Master’s Voice, Columbia and Parlophone right through to it’s liberation and status as a listed building. A lot of the talk was focused on The Beatles, and rightly so, their music is Abbey Road’s most famous export. It would be like giving a talk on Amsterdam that didn’t cover prostitution, relaxed drug laws and tulips.
The amazing thing about the studio is you can hear The Beatles in it. When Brian Kehew gave a demonstration of how the last note of A Day In The Life was recorded (by the four Beatles each hitting a chord on a different piano) the acoustics of the room gave it exactly the same rich quality it has on the recording.
To create the claustrophobic blues club vibe for Yer Blues the four of them clambered into a tiny tape room above the studio itself.
The place has an incredible ambience and an incredible history. It’s a hard thing to describe or explain. It feels as though you have been transported back, that the studio techs in lab coats could wander in at any second to set up. It’s been kept so well, preserved like a memory.
It’s a rare treat to be granted access to the studio. As an audience we were told they are not usually accessible to the public. That didn’t stop me wanting more though. Regardless of the fact I was sat in the same room The Beatles had recorded, I wanted to see it all. It felt as though things were being kept back. On every corner between the front door and Studio Two a security guard had been placed to ensure nobody wandered off and saw something they weren’t supposed to. I was reminded of Willy Wonka’s chocolate factory. It wasn’t enough I had a golden ticket, I wanted to go swimming in the chocolate river. At one point while everyone else was gumming themselves over archaic pieces of recording equipment I feigned needing to visit the little Beatles room and started off down a corridor. I found a bar. For a second I thought about going in and pretending I belonged there. Then I remembered I had an assignment to do. Disobeying orders made me need the toilet. I think I used George’s one.
The studio had been converted into a lecture theatre by a small stage being constructed for Brian and Kevin, and their projections and videos. The rest of the room was lines of red leather chairs with metal legs. During the lecture we were told the chairs had been brought in during the 60’s as it was discovered the squeak caused by the old wooden chairs often ruined recordings and an American studio had started using ones similar. The chairs have been in the studio since then. By the end of the talk I had convinced myself I was in John Lennon’s favourite chair.
I’ve already written two articles on the studios, and they’re a lot more professional and focused than this but I need time to geek out and freak out over being invited into my own personal Mecca
Fab as always Paul,sad when it came to the end.have the music stuck in my head now U bring it alive xx

xxWe have had NRIs come to us looking for property eviction lawyers as they face the issue of illegal possession of property. It is the most common property dispute NRIs face as they are unaware of the steps that they can take to avoid the situation.
They make investments using their hard earned money to secure their future if they return to India or to earn profits by selling the land at the higher price on a later date. But with the change in time and due to unfortunate experiences, the investment in India has reduced as people fear for the safety of the property.
Why do NRIs seek the help of Property Eviction Lawyers?
The NRIs pursue property eviction lawyers so that the legal aids can assist them in protecting their land from trespassers, encroachers and illegal possessors.
The easiest targets of the trespassers or encroachers are the Open properties that NRIs buy as investments.
Property can be taken over illegally in two ways. These are:
- Usage of forged documents by trespassers to challenge the legal owner’s rights and forcing them to send the land at a value much lower than the true value.
- Refusal to vacate the property by a tenant even after expiration of the lease or tenancy period and thus, overstaying illegally against owner’s will.
Thus, it is necessary for the NRIs to know about the choices available at their disposal to protect their property from the trespassers.
Protection of the property:
To prevent illegal possession of the asset, an NRI can:
- Make use of a Special Power of Attorney (POA) to give specific rights to a trustworthy friend or relative who can regularly check the property.
- Retain all the original and updated documents related to the property such as registered sale deeds, title deed, possession letters, tax bills, maintenance receipts, telephone and electricity bills, etc. with one’s self.
- Take help from an expert property lawyer to implement any legal documents such as lease agreement, tenancy agreement, and caretaker agreement.
- Before signing any legal document, enquire and aware one’s self about all the laws regarding the maintenance of assets, lease, or eviction of tenants.
- Provide written information about the property and one’s absence from India to the police.
- In order to prevent any trouble in future, register and present a photocopy of the tenancy agreement to the police after execution.
- Interact and stay in touch with the neighbours and managers of the building so that if anything illegal happens to the property, they inform the owner.
- Have regular visits to the property so that the locals can know about the owner of the property and people don’t consider it an easy target for trespassing.
It may happen that even after taking all the necessary, precautionary steps, following each and every law, one becomes a target of illegal possession of property. If this happens, one shouldn’t make any delay in taking mandatory steps, such as seeking help from property eviction lawyers, to get his/ her property back.1/8/2012

It becomes challenging to keep track of all the events; thus, the School Management System is a game-changer.
School Management System is an information management system for educational institutions. These systems give complete control of the day-to-day activities, academic curriculum, sports, library management, administration, etc. Therefore, school management software helps with easy and quick access to data.
Features Of Good School Management System are –
1. Student Data:
Teachers can get every detail of the student in management system software. From basic information like student’s address, parent’s name, siblings, student’s grades, attendance, homework, discipline, achievements, and medical history. All the information regarding the student can be accessed easily.
2. Transparency With Parents:
In this busy world, parents cannot be connected with their child’s school activities and academic progress. Therefore, the parent portal helps them to get regular updates on their child.
3. Attendance & Timetable Management :
Taking attendance is a painstaking task. It is a daily activity that teachers have to conduct at the beginning of the class. Sometimes, it is difficult for teachers to manage attendance and record them accurately. The school management system helps teachers to record attendance easily in the teacher’s app. They can share the attendance status with parents in just a matter of a few seconds.
4. Report Cards:
In school, a report card holds a lot of importance. It represents a student’s hard work throughout the academic year. However, it is a time-consuming activity for teachers. Thus, school management software can help teachers and school authorities to restructure and simplify the process.
5. Online Payment:
A lot of paperwork and efforts are involved in tracking the payment of school fees. Preparing and managing the receipts and bills of every student is time-consuming. Due to online payment, the whole process has become convenient for both parents & the school.
6. Reduces Workload:
An effective school management system software allows saving all the data in a system. So, whenever any data is required, it can be obtained immediately without having the trouble to save bundles of files.
7. Decreases Cost Of Communication:
It is very important to have effective communication among parents, school, and teachers. In this competitive age, a quarterly meeting of parents & teachers doesn’t give enough guidance. So, the parent portal plays a vital role in facilitating the communication process. A text message, voice message, and email can be sent to a set of parents or the whole school all at once. Thereby, it saves the time & money in making phone calls or leaving messages to parents. This helps in the overall progress of the student.
8. Home Assignments:
With an online school management system, every student can easily view the home assignments. The student knows every detail like the assignment topic, when the assignment is given, the submission date, etc.
9. Academic Calendar:
The software provides an academic calendar wherein parents are updated about events, meetings, exam schedules, assignments, annual days, etc.
10. Student- Teacher collaboration:
Apart from term examinations, online assessments are essential too. This helps to test the student’s knowledge regularly. As every student’s progress is different, teachers have to monitor each student’s ability closely. Thus, teachers can provide individual assignments depending on the level of knowledge the student generates. This technique of personal guidance becomes easy with the help of the School Management System.
In short, school management leads the school towards development through the optimum use of human resources, physical sources, values, and concepts.
What Is CRM And Why Does School Management System Need It?
Customer Relationship Management (CRM), in the school system, is an asset. It is a customer-centric system that can help educational professionals in:
- Nurturing relationships with prospective parents and students
- Producing data-driven meaningful insights to illustrate progress towards goals, and
- Streamlining admissions and marketing initiatives to save time and effort.
- It helps to focus on important things rather than mundane tasks.
What Is The Best Strategy To Choose CRM
For CRM, there is no one-size-fits-all concept. You will have to complete research and note down the features that are absolute must-haves for your school management system. Every school is different and so is their vision. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that your CRM is aligned with the values of your institution. Following are a few things to consider while choosing the best CRM for your school management system-
- User-friendly: This is an utmost important feature and without a doubt becomes the basic requirement of the system. A complicated CRM would reduce productivity as staff might struggle to do routine tasks.
- Customization: One needs to check whether the CRM system will be able to do all tasks or it has to be customized. Suppose, it needs customization, what will be the cost involved? Does it fit into your budget?
- Easy Reminders: By sending reminders, parents will feel an added level of personal attention and will appreciate the effort. Thus, improves your school’s customer experience.
- Integral Invoice Generation: Select a CRM that can manage your invoicing and send professional invoices to parents.
- Reporting: CRM should be able to generate custom reports. This feature will track a child’s progress based on different factors like academics, sports, fitness, communication, etc. This assures the parent that the school is monitoring their child’s growth in all aspects. Therefore, parents will have a great customer experience.
- Customer Support: Last but not the least, CRM should have good customer support. Anytime there is an issue, your clients shouldn’t face inconvenience. Good customer support will help you resolve the problem at the earliest.

A great way of releasing yourself from the grip of fluctuating energy prices, once you’ve paid for the initial installation, Solar Photovoltaic Panels will reduce your electricity costs. Any energy you produce but don’t use can then be sold back to the National Grid. a more environmentally friendly way and, in today’s world of global warming which produces severe weather conditions, that is a major element for many people, and should be for any carbon conscious person.
Solar cells, also known as photovoltaic (PV) cells, are able to convert sunlight straight into electricity. PV cells get their name from the process of converting light (photons) into electricity (voltage) which is titled as the PV effect. The PV effect was discovered in 1954 by the scientists at Bell Telephone. They discovered that silicone created an electric charge when exposed to sunlight, creating the foundation of what would eventually become the solar cells that we see power everything from watches to satellites. It wasn’t until the 90’s where some people began experimenting with PV panels on their own home, trying to generate their own electricity from the sun so that they could become self-sufficient. This idea has become much more domesticated & mainstream, as there are now 1.7 million homes with solar panels on their roof, generating their own electricity!
PJ Bryer Heating & Plumbing Services based in Bristol, offer impartial advice on the feasibility, size and location of a Solar PV system for your property. After we have identified there will be a cost saving for you, our team will professionally install your system to meet the highest accredited standards.

Our client, age 21 and with no prior criminal history, was walking home from a Hermosa Beach bar with his friends and felt the need to urinate. It was after the bars had closed, so he found a dark area of an alley and relieved himself.
Hermosa Beach Alley
As if hiding in the shadows, a Hermosa Beach police officer immediately approached our client and asked him if he had just urinated in the alley. Our client admitted he had, apologizing as much as he could. Our client apparently hoped that the more he apologized, the more likely the police officer would decide not to issue a ticket or arrest him.
The attempt to avoid the ticket failed and our client was handed a ticket for a misdemeanor violation of Penal Code § 372 (“Public Nuisance”). He was not taken to the Hermosa Beach Police Station and booked because he signed a promise to appear in the Torrance Superior Court a few weeks later.
He was confused and worried about the misdemeanor charge. He looked online and found that the maximum fine was $1000 (plus penalties and assessments that would boost the total to be paid to over $4,500) and six months in jail, so he became concerned.
He then contacted Greg Hill & Associates and met with Greg Hill. Greg listened to the facts of the case and explained the law that applies, as well as his experience with similar such cases in the Torrance Courthouse.He then contacted Greg Hill & Associates and met with Greg Hill. Greg listened to the facts of the case and explained the law that applies, as well as his experience with similar such cases in the Torrance Courthouse.In a Nutshell: Hermosa Beach, misdemeanor public nuisance (Penal Code § 372) charged, client, age 21, plea bargains case to an infraction for disturbing the peace (Penal Code § 415(2)).
Greg recommended that the client attend ten AA meetings prior to the arraignment and then provide him with documentary proof of such attendance.
Greg then took the proof to court on the day of the arraignment with him and showed the prosecutor the AA sign-in sheet. The client did not need to come to court with Greg, as an attorney may appear on behalf of a party in most misdemeanors, which did include this type of case.
The prosecutor kindly, in response to the client’s efforts to address the alcohol element involved in his conduct, amended the complaint to allege a violation of Penal Code § 415(2) (“Disturbing the Peace – Playing Loud Music”) as an infraction.
An infraction is far preferable to a misdemeanor insofar as a misdemeanor can involve jail time and being on probation for up to five years (although not in a Penal Code § 372 matter). An infraction involves no jail time and no probation. Parking tickets are infractions, so the plea bargain offered to our client was attractive insofar as anyone viewing his record would see what amounted to a very minor offense comparable to a parking ticket.
The client then pled “No Contest” to the Penal Code § 415(2) charge and paid a $50 fine, plus penalties and assessments for a total of $308. It is noteworthy that this very low fine is unusually low for such cases out of Hermosa Beach. The fine is usually $250, plus penalties and assessments (totaling $1,130), so our client’s effort at attending 10 AA’s, based on Greg’s advice, saved him not only a misdemeanor conviction on his record, but over $1,100.
The client was happy with the plea bargain, as he avoided a criminal record and was not placed on probation.

I missed it when Wal-Mart announced last month that it was going to start asking some suppliers to monitor energy use in producing products for Wal-Mart.
Do not get me wrong, as a Free Market Fundamentalist, I love Wal-Mart and I especially love their low prices on the necessities (Tide, veggies, etc). I also know from my reading that Wal-Mart has single handedly done more to improve the life of lower incomes Americans than just about any government program through its low prices and consistent quality.
What worries me is when big corporations start getting cozy with groups that want to use the power of government to pursue an agenda. While Wal-Mart can handle about anything that the state or federal government throws at them, the same can not be said of their smaller competitors or small suppliers. We are already seeing global energy companies getting on the Global Warming bandwagon hoping for a competitive advantage, now Wal-Mart.
While many environmentalists will cautiously watch Wal-Mart and take their time in applauding, those on the side of free-markets should sit up and notice that the argument over regulation and global warming may be over before they are fully engaged in the debate.Red Wolf and Big Book Giveaway!

TALKATIVENESS
by Michael Earl Craig
Wave Books, 104 pages
reviewed by Anthony Blake
In a recent column of The New York Times, leading poets were once again asked whether their genre could ever regain its relevancy. William Logan’s contribution “As for relevance, poetry does not need to be relevant. It needs to be good” and David Biespiel’s assertion “Does poetry matter? Yes. Can poetry be more relevant? No.” paint poetry as a rogue agent that doesn’t need the approval of its peers. For a bleaker view of things, throw in David Orr’s depiction of poetry as “the weak sister of its sibling arts, alternately ignored and swaddled like a 19th-century invalid, and that will change only by means of a long, tedious and possibly futile effort at persuasion.” A comprehensive picture unfolds. For better or worse, poetry isn’t relevant today and cannot, or cannot easily, become so again.
And yet, either unaware of this assessment or, more likely, in spite of it, Michael Earl Craig (Thin Kimono) opens his fourth poetry collection, Talkativeness, with this Yamamoto Tsunetomo quotation: “No matter how good what you are saying might be, it will dampen the conversation if it is irrelevant.” With Talkativeness, Craig attempts the impossible—to create a beautiful work of poetic art that is also applicable to contemporary readers. And in many stunning ways, he succeeds.
Michael Earl Craig
With the cinematic touch of David Lynch, Craig composes poems that are all at once mundane, current, and deeply unsettling. Straight lines drawn from the lead tip of a bullet, tongues crashing onto tables like “obscene mollusks,” and apartment-trashing tortoises adorn an otherwise flavorless, indistinct Midwestern landscape. “It was Nebraska everywhere,” Craig declares, and from this tension between the familiar and the absurd, he builds poems with devastating grief, horror, and dark, biting humor.
We are introduced to the son of a cigar store Indian, the piccolo is asserted to be an instrument of dread, and in an experimental town, seventeen cops can only say “that’s the way the cookie crumbles.”
In “Wild for the Lord,” as the speaker cuts the bangs of his best friend’s wife, his watch feels like “a small corpse on [his] wrist.” This sense of gravity, combined with the consistently sparse language of Craig’s poems, elevates the reading to a vaguely religious experience—the object of reverence, while undefined, seems to be the strangeness and multiplicity of our everyday lives. Even the most seemingly insignificant acts, such as turkeys moving out of the woods toward the house, are treated with a manic urgency:
A group of dark turkeys steps
as turkeys often do from the woods
and moves unsteadily toward the house.
It’s like our throats are about to be slit
I say, laughing nervously.
All the while Talkativeness lives up to its moniker; it is written conversationally, with bare language, dialogue, and references directly to its readers. Distinct to the collection is Craig’s use of repetition that reads like un-erased revisions. Here in “Winter” each line appears to edit and specify the last; it builds in Talkativeness an environment of intimacy and immediacy:
we saw only a shaft of light in winter
we saw only some winter light
the kind of light you most often see in winter.
Undoubtedly entertaining and wide-ranging, is this collection also the bright final answer to the problem of relevancy? Craig provides his own answer for this:
They say poetry is dead. Or that
it might still live, but only
for insiders. . . .
I say maybe, thumbing through my
Hasselhoff Dossier. This further
infuriates
Maybe, the most unsatisfying answer, is the life-force of this collection. Instead of asserting knowledge, Craig is happier to proclaim “I don’t know.” “From the Couch,” a poem in which Dick Cheney is rolled into Obama’s inauguration disguised as Dr. Strangelove, ends with the line “I’m not even saying this is a poem.” Throughout the collection, he demonstrates a willingness to blend and disassociate forms from their expected norms; poems are couched as sketches, novellas, music, screenplays, speeches, and even CVs. is a poet from Louisville, Kentucky and an MFA candidate at the University of Arkansas. He has worked as Marketing and Editorial Assistant at Sarabande Books and been published in The Bellingham Review.Shorter days and cooler nights are a sure sign that fall is in full swing and that means the holidays will soon be here. Log in below for tricks on how to transform your decor from fall to festive.
Details
COLOR
Keep decorations simple and clean with metallic accents and rustic, nature-inspired colors. By choosing neutral metallic tones such as gold, silver, copper and champagne over the traditional holiday colors, it allows an easier transition from autumn to winter decor.
Earthy, fall colors include burnt orange, deep green, soft yellow and rich brown. Add an elegant holiday touch to these colors with metallic gold or deep burgundy. Choose three colors that complement each other to keep the look of your decorations refined and tidy.
TEXTURE
Add throws and pillows to sofas and chairs, being sure to include textures, such as velvet, suede and faux fur. Embossed leather, feathers and wood beads also add texture when accessorizing mantels or other furniture.
Consider combining silky and rough/coarse textures, such as a satin table runner with a grapevine basket full of pine cones for a centerpiece. A work of art can also add to the look and feel of a room.
MAKE SCENTS
A festive fragrance can evoke holiday memories and make your home feel warm and inviting. Fresh herbs, such as rosemary, can be added to Thanksgiving decorations and then swapped out for cloves or cinnamon sticks for Christmas.
Simmering recipes are another way to fill your home with natural fragrances. Fill a pot with water and your choice of ingredients, such as apple peels, cinnamon sticks, or nutmeg. Let it simmer on your stove and re-check the water levels every half hour to keep it from burning dry.
Candles also are a popular choice for holiday decorations, from tea lights to pillars in a variety of colors and designs. Favorite seasonal fragrances include peppermint, balsam, cedar, evergreen, gingerbread and sugar cookie.
HOW TO - below are variations of two types of centerpieces you can try.
CANDLE CENTERPIECE
The Base: Glass hurricane Globe
For Fall: Use a burnt-orange candle insider and surround with pine cones, acorns, miniature pumpkins and gourds.
For the holidays: Swap out the orange candle for an ivory, red or metallic one. We used a sparkling white candle. Add silver and blue ornaments and mini wrapped presents. You could also add some artificial snow at the base of the candle.
BOWL CENTERPIECE
The base: Bamboo bowl and grapevine wreath.
For fall: Fill the bowl with Indian corn, pine cones and gourds. Add some Indian corn around the wreath for added texture.
For the holidays: Add a shimmering ribbon around the wreath. Swap out the gourds and Indian corn for metallic ornaments and miniature presents.
OTHER IDEAS
The base: A mirror
For fall: Hang a rustic wreath over it.
For the holidays: Keep the wreath over the mirror, and add fresh greens, holly and cranberries.
The base: A basket
For fall: Fill with real apples and faux berries.
For the holidays: Add a few pine twigs and glass balls.
The base: A bookcase
For fall: Place mini pumpkins and faux leaves among your family photos and in nooks.
For the holidays: Swap them out for glass balls and fresh greens
The base: A cluster of fresh greens and pine cones
For fall: Add gourds and amber candles
For the holidays: Swap out the gourds and candles for ivory candles, soft umber or mercury glass decorations.
The base: Glass candy dish or vase
For fall: Fill with candy corn, gummy pumpkins and other treats.
For the holidays: Fill with candy canes and chocolates wrapped in red, green and gold.

They have to face a number of obstacles in the entire process right from the beginning to the ultimate introduction of the product in the market. In order to make this process easy and smooth the inventors of new products make a quick prototype of their design. This prototype also offers various other benefits discussed here under.
Before discussing the benefits of a prototype you must know what prototype is? A prototype can be defined as the first functional and full scale model of the new design.
Reasons to make a prototype
Inexpensive way to avoid failure: Invention prototypes are normally made to avoid the risk of failure as it is the most inexpensive way to find out the faults in the design and amend them before introducing the product finally in the market.
Collection of accurate requirements: Inadequate availability of requirements can compel you to bear nearly half of the cost of the project to work on it again. Traditionally used techniques to gather requirements like focus groups and interviews etc. may not be enough to convince people as most of the do not believe on your idea before you show them their actual shape. You can show the functioning of your product to know the requirements for its final product by creating its functional prototype.
Technical understanding of the issues: In order to understand that you may have to face while introducing final product invention prototypes play a great role. You can easily know the predictable and unpredictable problems in the design of the device, by developing its functional prototype. It will also help you in developing your product more elegantly by applying the solutions you have found out after using the prototype.
Resolve challenges: If you have a strong opinion about the use of particular feature then you can be the best engineer. But difference in opinions of several engineers can result into a conflicting situation which cannot be resolved only on the basis of guesses, experiences and opinions unless you have something solid to work on. A prototype can help you in implementing your different features quickly on it to know about their performance and analyse their results. It not only saves time but also makes it sure that your decisions about the design are correct.
Bring in financial support: The demonstration of a prototype can help in convincing the investors about the feasibility of the idea and encourage them to invest on your idea due to low risk on their investment.
Easy to file patent: Though today’s laws of patent and trademark do not need to file a model or prototype while filing for patenting the invention still it is one of the best ways to convince the authorities and show the reduction of the use of technology in practice.
In this way, a functional prototype of an invention is very effective way to find out the faults in the basic idea and improving the ultimate product before introducing in the market.Provincial Strategies of Economic Reform in Post-Mao China: Leadership, Politics, and Implementation

Under the auspices of the Stanford Conservation Trust (SCT), the Stanford Community Recycling project (SCORE) – also known as the Stanford “swop shop” – seeks to promote recycling and consequently reduce solid waste by giving Stanford’s disadvantaged and economically challenged residents the opportunity to exchange recyclable plastic, glass, tins and some paper for tokens which can be used to ‘purchase goods from the Swop Shop. The goods consist of school stationery, reading books, toys, second-hand clothing, household linen and goods, shoes, toiletry items including sanitary pads (both disposable and washable, re-usable). One of the aims is to instil an ethic of having to ‘work’ to be able to ‘buy’ what you need – no free handouts.
The Swop Shop is open three times a month – twice a month at the Stanford Community Hall precinct and once a month at Die Kop, the informal settlement. All items in the shop are donated, and everyone ‘manning’ the shop does this on a voluntary basis. Regular fundraising and donations allow the SCORE team to purchase the items available in the Swop Shop.
LOCATION / AREA
The SCORE Swop Shop is located on Stanford Municipal premises / Stanford Community Hall precinct in Bezuidenhout Street. The shop presently operates from a 3m container which was recently donated by Nedbank. On 24 February 2018 a second, 12m container was purchased from funds raised, and will enable the shop to operate in a more organized and professional manner. Once a month, the shop operates at Die Kop informal settlement.
BENEFICIARIES
The low income residents of Stanford South, Tembelihle and Die Kop are the beneficiaries. They are able to “purchase” necessary school and personal items by means of personal effort (collecting recyclable items) and rather keep their meagre income to put food on the table.
The introduction of sanitary pads is an additional aim to enable the disadvantaged female youth to regularly attend school and receive the education they are entitled to.
MOTIVATION
About 60% of Stanford’s residents are economically challenged and more often than not have to forfeit human dignity (toothpaste, sanitary pads etc) in order to buy food for the table. The same applies to items that stimulate children mentally and physically – such as reading books, balls etc. The Swop Shop gives residents the opportunity to access these types of goods and hence improve their human dignity and scholastic development.
The Municipality, on the other hand, benefits in that they do not have to collect recyclable material and only assist 2 hours a day every second week to collect all the recyclables brought to the Swop Shop. The municipality further benefits from the project as promoting recycling reduces the volume of waste brought to the landfill site, extending the life span thereof and the subsequent capital cost of having to build a new landfill site.
IMPACT
The SCORE Swop Shop hopes to educate as many of the local population as possible in the importance of keeping their environment clean, as well as the health hazards to which their families are exposed because of diseases proliferating in garbage. It will be measured by noticing the difference in the cleanliness of the streets, getting feedback from the municipal refuse collection staff on the volumes of recyclables which are collected without them having to employ more labour. It is hoped that with constant educational talks and the very act of collecting the items will instil in the residents who attend the Swop Shop the importance of not littering, i.e. throwing down the goods in the first place.
The RECYCLING project therefore reduces SOLID WASTE by cleaning up the ENVIRONMENT and stimulates SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT by focussing on the most marginalised communities in the Overstrand area.
COMMENCEMENT
This project has been running since 2014 and used to operate under the wings of Stanford Rotary. However, in August 2016, Stanford Rotary requested the Stanford Conservation Trust to take over SCORE on as a project as the point of departure is a cleaner environment. Since then SCORE is officially a Stanford Conservation project.
The project is ongoing as long as the SCORE Team can keep it sustainable. This is made possible with help from the local community who donate most of the items for sale in the swop shop, except for most of the stationery and toiletries for which funding is sought. The main focus is to provide school stationary in order to improve school performance. SCORE is presently also investigating avenues to obtain second-hand school clothing.
Unfortunately the school performance of disadvantaged girls is severely hampered because of the female biological cycle. As they do not have the money to purchase sanitary pads, they stay at home and lose a week’s school work. At present a donation to purchase sanitary wear for school girls has been received, which should last until the July 2018. A program is being workshopped, with the assistance of the local Clinic and SCORE team members, in the local schools at present and should result in providing numbers of girls who need monthly assistance. Education re using washable and/or re-usable sanitary wear is part of the program. Basic toiletries such as soap, toothpaste and deodorant are also in great demand.
Grant-in-Aid funding will enable the project to continue the good work to date, keep the environment clean, allow the youth to improve school performance and assist the municipality in postponing the development of new landfill site and reducing sewerage blockages because of the (monthly) rags flushed down the sewerage system.
TOTAL COST OF PROJECT
LIST OF OTHER ANTICIPATED INCOME SOURCES
- Stanford Conservation Trust: Monthly Wine & Wisdom fundraiser (2 months/year for SCORE).
- Private donors (erratic).
- Goods donated by Stanford residents, friends and family.
- Goods donated by Stanford Animal Welfare (not selling in their shop).
- Annual fundraiser.
- Donated goods sold on the monthly Stanford Junktique market.
- Donations of children’s’ books by publishing companies.
Note: Stanford does not have major businesses which can be approached for funding. When approaching such companies in Hermanus and Gansbaai, the (understandable) reply is that they support their own community. The Swop Shop therefore heavily relies on the goodwill of the more affluent Stanford residents, as well as their family and friends.
The New Weighing Station at the Swap Shop site at Ou Krale next to Die Stoor’s yard at the Community Hall. This was opened on Monday 14 May with many members of the local community waiting patiently with their bags of recycling. Volunteers were on hand to smooth the process and run the shop.

The train passed through a number of ramshackle farming settlements before reaching Yanai, which I had decided to visit on a somewhat spur of the moment day trip during my travels in Yamaguchi prefecture.
Yanai is a small city with a population of just over 34,000. It has a sleepy, laid back atmosphere and as I left the station, the few people I saw out and about were either schoolchildren on their bikes or old couples strolling in the sunshine. I decided to make the most of the pleasant weather, too, and wandered beside the shallow river running through the city until I came to the Shirakabe no Machi, or ‘white-walled town’.
Dating back to the Edo period and once home to Yanai’s prosperous merchant population, the Shirakabe no Machi is a charming district of cobbled streets and small shops selling local handicrafts. As the name suggests, the buildings here are whitewashed, most of them with traditional lattice doors and paper-covered windows. This picturesque area has a number of attractions, including an old soy sauce factory and some well-preserved merchant residences. However, the main reason for my trip to Yanai was to see the goldfish.
Yes, goldfish. The whole city, but particularly the Shirakabe no Machi, is filled with them. Not real goldfish, but delicate paper lanterns that hang outside many of the houses, shops and restaurants. The story goes that, 150 years ago, some of Yanai’s merchants decided to make paper goldfish to entertain their children. They carefully stretched red-dyed tissue paper over bamboo frames, and then pasted on the large round eyes and flowing fins that make the lanterns so distinctive today.
It was after the Second World War that the lanterns really took off in popularity, and they are now designated a traditional Japanese folk art. On 13th August each year, the city comes to life when more than 2000 goldfish lanterns light up the streets in what is sometimes described as the ‘goldfish nebuta’, with a humorous nod to the famous festival in Aomori prefecture. People flock to Yanai to take part in (real) goldfish scooping contests, browse for goods at a sprawling night market held in the Shirakabe no Machi, and dance in the lantern parade. The festival culminates in a large fireworks display.
On this spring day, however, the Shirakabe no Machi was quiet. I felt like I had travelled back in time as I wandered along the narrow streets and admired the many goldfish lanterns swaying softly in the breeze. Pausing outside one shop, I noticed the door was open and something compelled me to slide it a bit further and step inside.
I found myself in a dimly lit interior, surrounded by (you guessed it) goldfish lanterns of varying sizes hanging from the ceiling. As I realised that not all of them were finished, with some lacking fins and eyes, a Japanese woman in her mid-80s emerged from the back of the shop and greeted me. She introduced herself as Masae-san, the shop owner. She pointed to the unfinished goldfish lanterns and told me that if I wanted, I could have a go at making one myself. I decided that I would indeed like to take home a goldfish of my own, and so I decided to make a medium-sized lantern.
I knelt down at a low table as Masae-san explained the various stages of the lantern-making process. With the body already prepared, I assumed that all I’d need to do would be to add the finishing touches. How difficult could it be? As it turned out, it was actually quite tricky. The paper tore easily, so I had to be very careful when sticking it down. I also had to use a thin brush to paint stripes onto the tail and fins. Masae-san looked on with amusement as I struggled to get them even, and in the end offered me a skilful helping hand with the gluing.
Whilst my goldfish dried, Masae-san brought out snacks and homemade sakura tea picked from the cherry tree in her garden. In the shop were some framed photographs of Masae-san’s late husband. In the past they had made goldfish lanterns together, but since he sadly passed away several years ago, she has run the shop on her own. She also got out some photo albums and showed me pictures of her family and her house, including her beautiful and well-kept garden. In return, I showed her some photos of my family that I had saved on my phone.
Although my Japanese is basic, and Masae-san spoke no English, we spent a wonderful hour chatting with each other through a combination of guesswork, gestures and good humour. As I left, my goldfish wrapped up in layers of bubble wrap and placed tenderly in a box, Masae-san insisted on giving me a small container of her sakura tea as a parting gift.
Thanks to the rather extravagant packaging, my goldfish lantern survived its long and bumpy journey intact and safely reached my home thousands of miles away. Whenever I look at it, it makes me smile with the memories it brings of a sunny day, sakura tea and yet another example of the great kindness and hospitality that I experienced on countless occasions whilst travelling in Japan. Masae-san, arigatou gozaimasu!.Since 2012, the Urbaniahoeve Foundation, is working together with partners and locals to develop Foodscape Wildeman, a food forest in the public space of the Wildeman neighbourhood of Amsterdam New West. A food forest, by definition, is integrated in the existing environment/landscape, but is still a most productive form of agriculture. Debra will talk about Urbaniahoeve's efforts to adapt the cultural heritage of the existing garden city landscape architecture of Amsterdam Nieuw West, whilst prioritising the eco-system and implementing necessary, in situ topsoil production.

Debra is a conceptual artist based in Amsterdam, founder of Urbaniahoeve (‘the city as our farm’), a Social Design Lab for Urban Agriculture, which develops edible, ecological landscapes in the public space and produces fertile soils out of urban waste streams. Urbaniahoeve's conceptual roots are in the Land Art movement of the 1960's and 70's, in particular artist Robert Smithson's 'Non-site' installations from 1969.
Debra’s commissions include a soil remediation installation for Amsterdam-based project Farming the City and two ‘edible schoolyard’ initiatives in Amsterdam, transforming concrete to vegetable gardens using mushroom cultivation and worm composting. Debra’s exhibitions include a poster as part of exhibition Dirt Dialogues at the 20th World Congress of Soil Science, in South Korea and Foodprint - Food for the City for Stroom Den Haag in The Hague. Debra has lectured at the Dutch Art Institute, Utrecht School of the Arts, University of California and Design Academy Eindhoven. From 2005 to 2012 she was the author of culiblog.org, a weblog about food, food culture and the culture that grows our food that at the height of its popularity enjoyed 70,000 individual readers per month.
Debra will be at Schumacher College as part of Soil Culture, a project led by the Centre for Contemporary Art and the Natural World, using the arts to inspire a deeper public understanding of the importance of soil.
URBANIAHOEVE Social Design Lab for Urban Agriculture
Urbaniahoeve Social Design Lab for Urban Agriculture produces edible landscapes in the public space of the city, transforming existing urban monocultures into an edible ecological framework. Urbaniahoeve was founded in the Netherlands in 2010 by Debra Solomon (artist, independent urban agriculture researcher), joined by Mariska van den Berg (art historian, writer, researcher of bottom-up public space infrastructure) in 2012. Urbaniahoeve initiates and coordinates structural forms of urban agriculture in the public space by creating a contiguous, resplendent, fertile, and edible ecological framework in the existing public space of the city. As producers of (food system) infrastructure, creating park-like food forests, food-bearing ecosystems, their small-scale urban agriculture projects strategically contribute to a marked increase in biodiversity in situ, the greening of the city as a whole, and produce fertile soils out of urban waste streams.Sugar Bear Plumbing Co. can clear even the toughest of clogged drains with our expertise and professional equipment.

Fourteen military vehicles were captured, he said, while the SLM's losses were only one dead and seven wounded. The fighting happened in the Darfur region of western Sudan Differing reports The governor of north Darfur State, Osman Yusuf Kubur, told journalists about 200 rebels launched the assault on Al-Teinah on Monday. But he said government forces chased SLM troops out of town and destroyed a number of their vehicles. Some crossed the border and engaged in fighting with Chadian army troops, Kubur added. Last Saturday, the governor said 15 Sudanese soldiers and 30 rebels were killed when Darfur separatists attacked the border garrison town. SLM objectives SLM history: Founded March 2003 Seeks a devolved, federal Sudan Chief spokesman, Mani Minawi, based in Cairo The SLM since late February 2003 has carried out several attacks on government forces in the remote and partly desert region of Darfur, which lies on the border with Chad. Denouncing policies of alleged “marginalisation, racial discrimination, exclusion, exploitation and divisiveness”, the SLM and its military wing, the Sudan Liberation Army, announced their formation in March 2003. Its objective is complete restructuring and devolution of power for all regions of the largest African country. Minawai said in March the “SLM shall struggle to achieve a decentralized form of governance based on the right of Sudan’s different regions to govern themselves autonomously through a federal or confederal system.” SOURCE: Aljazeera + AgenciesThe Global Pressure Sensitive Tapes Market is poised to grow strong during the forecast period 2017 to 2027.

I’d explain that my plan goes into effect immediately (that is, tomorrow at 12 AM sharp – all around the world, of course, because I am in charge of it). This would be greeted by worldwide approval (good to have when you’re in charge of the world). I would become very popular indeed. However, shortly thereafter confusion would reign.
Despite my good intentions, and very clear instructions, some people wake up at the regular time – not when they want to. Why is that? Force of habit? Fear of reprisals? Failure to understand my instructions? Are they so accustomed to bad news that they struggle to accept good news? These sleep-in-refusers move apprehensively through the empty streets, wondering where all the people have gone and repeatedly asking themselves if they’ve missed out on something. At the train station, they hope to get to work, where they will find some relief from this new life I’ve thrust upon them; but most of the train conductors have slept in. Only one showed up and he is angry. Everyone is queued to get on his train. There are no snacks or coffee. Someone in accounting observes that those making minimum wage are the most likely to take advantage of my new plan and sleep in. Everyone becomes bitter, angry, hungry and thirsty. It gets worst.
Soon couples are bickering over when the alarm clock should be set – if at all. Perhaps the divorce rate would soar, if they could only find judges and lawyers who were awake. Some people don’t know what to do with the extra time I have granted them. They call on friends who are fast asleep. Some people stop buying things. Bank managers – still waking up at 6 AM – give two reasons for this downward trend. Firstly, most shops open whenever they want to and products may or may not arrive. A Coca-Cola truck, for example, may be stuck on the roadside while the driver has a nap. Secondly, too many people are happy. Children and teenagers are the happiest, which increases the cause for worldwide concern (not good to have when you’re in charge of the world).
Soon thereafter, I give up being in charge of the world. I step down not because of majority rule, but because of the constant complaints and moaning of those few who refused to accept my good intentions. How will the world remember me? During my entire reign, which someone in accounting estimated to be just over two days, I tried my best. I would hope that most people around the world remembered me fondly and appreciated my simple plan. I concede that some, too accustomed to waking up whenever they wanted to, will get fired culminating in a life-long contempt for “that person who was in charge of the world”.
No longer world leader, my boss tells me I have to return to work. As I sit on a crowded early morning train, heading into work, I study the silent faces around me. I come to a simple conclusion – some people don’t know a good thing when they have it.Diyode Meeting - Dec 07, 2015

According to Vilius Kavaliauskas – CEO of „Lewben Group“– the company recognized a demand for law compliance services while analyzing global compliance strengthening tendencies for private business, especially in the money laundering prevention field. This service became extremely important in light of proposed changes in Lithuania’s Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Prevention Act.
„Regulation demands are becoming increasingly stricter globally. Once legal changes will come into force in the end of June, even wider range of Lithuanian businesses will be obliged to dedicate much more attention and resources for compliance. Not doing so might cause significant financial and reputation losses. “ – says V. Kavaliauskas.
For startups or businesses who recently fell into the regulation area „Lewben Group“ provides full Regulatory Risk, Compliance and AML service package which includes designing and implementing of AML/CTF policy and procedures, control processes, selection of suitable IT vendors and outsourcing of further compliance procedure maintenance. The client is introduced to applicable regulation, consulted on how to implement complicated requirements, adapt them to business specifics, special training sessions are being organized for staff and management.
For businesses who already have the AML/CTF policy and program in place and dedicated compliance officer, „Lewben Group“ offers to independently review the AML/CTF program and assess the effectiveness of controls. The in-house personnel cannot perform this assessment on its own due to independency requirement. „Lewben Group“ can also perform AML/CTF risk assessment, consult on ways to improve existing control procedures and remediate weaknesses.
Toma Zaržeckytė Director of Compliance Services says that with new law in force companies, management and even shareholders are to face heavy fines for incompliance. Management and owners of financial institutions risk receiving a fine up to € 5,1 million, the fine issued for managers of non – financial bodies can go up to to €1,1 million or more. The main issue for companies will be meeting all statutory requirements and still remain effective, focusing most of their attention and resources on business development.
“Regulatory institutions are facing a lack of recourses, this is why they cannot provide all proactive help that is necessary to private sector, such as targeted trainings, sharing of best – practice examples and recommendations for the sector they supervise. Businesses will have to act proactively, find additional resources, seek trustworthy partners for consultations and improve their internal procedures. “ – asserts Toma Zaržeckytė.Sebastian River High School had eight athletes sign to colleges on Nov. 9, 2017. ED KILLER/TCPALM
Eight student athletes from Sebastian River High School celebrated making choices to continue competing in their respective sports at the next level after graduation in May.
Rowers Alexandria Thull (Clemson), Ashley Winans (Stetson), Sydney Spicer (Florida Institute of Technology) and Meghan Faria (Drake); Girls lacrosse player Toniann Rea (Mercer); and baseball players Edward Simchick (Kentucky Wesleyan), Zachary Young (University of South Alabama) and Christopher Landis (Marshall) signed athletic scholarships Thursday in front of Sharks friends and family.
"It's extremely special to see our student athletes move on to the next level," said Jessica Upchurch, athletic director at Sebastian River.
For crew coach Tom Lange, Thursday represented the day with the most rowers signing athletic scholarships at one time.
"It's exciting to have a team that has four athletes who are able to go on to the next level, plus we have a couple more who are still in the process of working out details on what their future holds," said Lange, who helped found the school's rowing team as its first coach 14 years ago. "They are going to great universities and they will enjoy their next four years because they love rowing so much."
Girls lacrosse player Toniann Rea began playing the sport in middle school and is grateful to be able to continue on.
"Toniann is a terrific lacrosse player and her work ethic is outstanding," said lacrosse coach Mike Perez. "She served as a great role model to the other girls to demonstrate what they have to do if they want to take the next step."
Vanessa Winans, mother of Ashley Winans, fought back tears of joy during her daughter's big day.
"Today is really special because our baby girl, who turns 18 Sunday, has done so much independently through academics, through athletics, through being a great kid," Winans said. "As a parent, you hope you have a kid who turns out good, and she turned out great. Rowing is life, they say, and it is. The sport has taught her so much."
Faria said the journey was long, but worth it.
"I started rowing in 8th grade and it stuck with me," she said. "It is such a part of my life. I never knew I was going to be able to do this, but it goes to show, if you set a goal, you can reach it."

This means five-year-old Andrea’s grandparents and aunt will be able to attend her funeral on Monday.
SUS-141222-091129001
Visas for the family, who come from Zimbabwe were refused twice, but after a personal letter from David Cameron, the visas were granted today (January 5).
Immigration and Security Minister James Brokenshire said, “The decision to grant or refuse a visa to the UK is often a difficult one. Immigration officers have to weigh often compelling situations against the fundamental requirement to protect the British border and the integrity of the immigration system.
“The UK visa system has rules which allow for a decision to be made on compassionate grounds. Andrea Gada’s family have provided new information and assurances in fresh visa applications to enable them to attend her funeral in Eastbourne. In the light of these details and given the tragic circumstances, these have now been granted. My thoughts are with the family at this extremely difficult time.”
Andrea was killed in a road accident on Friday Street in Eastbourne in December. Since then, her parents Wellington and Charity have been fighting for temporary visas for their relatives to attend her funeral, which had to be postponed.
An online petition urging the Home Office to grant the visas reached 130,000 signatures.
MP Stephen Lloyd said, “Stunning news. I’ve just heard from the Home Office the Gada family have been granted their temporary travel visas to attend little Andrea’s funeral. This is brilliant. Huge thanks to everyone who has helped, written in, made a difference. Thank you all from the bottom of my heart. Decency will out!!”Strava

Press reports of the 5th of this month show that a social activist has challenged the legality and propriety of an age old system in our courts. The demand is for providing seating facility for the ‘under trial accused’ who is forced to be present in court to watch the trial against him. The PIL seeks for a direction to all Judicial and Quasi-Judicial Forums in the state to treat victims, witnesses and suspects with dignity by offering them seats. The report goes on to say that on the 4th of this month the Bench Comprising of Chief Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Justice T.S Jaiganesh of the Madras High Court also gave some directions to the Registrar General in this regard. Reportedly, the Court held:
"We find it difficult to accept that any court would deliberately make a woman or an expectant mother to stand in the court. Even in the witness box, a person can be seated, if required, This issue should be looked into by Registrar General of the Court and if required, necessary direction/office order can be issued”
The above direction took me back to the late Ninetees when I was a Sessions Judge and was confronted with a similar situation, though not on any PIL. I was trying a batch of six or seven criminal cases against a Ripper, an alleged serial killer, one after the other. Each trial would last about ten days and thus the Ripper was in my court for over two months. Imagine his plight to be on his feet right from 11 in the morning till 5 pm when the court would disperse!
This ripper was an intelligent man; one who was well aware of the latest decisions of the Supreme Court and of his own human rights. Day long standing in the box on the first few days made him restive. After a few hours of standing in the box on one day, the ripper made a humble demand. He should be allowed to sit down in the box. I found no reason to deny the demand once I put myself in his stead, appreciated his plight and considered the justifiability of the demand. After all, how long can one stand? After a few minutes any one would feel the urge to sit down and after some more time, his feet would no more support him. He will, perforce, change from vertical to horizontal posture. Apart from this biological compulsion, the legal side is also in his favour. He is in the box not as a convicted prisoner; but only as an under trial accused. The law presumes him to be innocent until convicted after trial. The human right angle is also in his favour. May he be in the box reserved for the accused; nevertheless, he is a human entitled to maintain his dignity. He cannot be treated like an animal. So why not he sit in the box?
There is one more ground in his favour. The logic behind his forced existence in court, of course, in the dock, is as a person directly interested; in fact most interested in the ongoing trial. He must have an opportunity to watch the demeanor of witnesses and test whether sworn version given by a particular witness was falsehood, truth or a mixture of both. If the witness was speaking untruth, the testimony has to be demolished. The only weapon in his hand therefor, is the cross examination that he can do by himself or through his counsel. For that the counsel has to be briefed about the back ground of the witness and why his testimony is false and incongruous with other proved facts. Later on the Accused will also have to face questioning under section 313 of Cr.PC which also would be best possible only if he was listening to what was going on in court. After compelling his presence there for the above purposes, can he be treated in an inhuman fashion?
The result of all these mental exercises was that the Ripper was allowed to sit down in the dock. He sat on the floor and was contented; but I was not. Why should he squat? Is he not entitled to better treatment with more dignity? What benefit does the system get when he is denied a proper seat? Why not provide him a bench though that was not requested for? After all, under the existing circular of the High Court, a witness summoned is an honoured guest of the Court and entitled to be provided with a chair in the witness box. Why not extend the benefit to the Accused too when that does not offend any law? The outcome of all this was that in coming days a bench found its place in the Accused Box. Ripper was happy; I too was happy. Trials in the Ripper series went on smoothly. In those of the cases where acceptable evidence came in, he was convicted; in such others where the circumstantial evidence available was infirm, he was acquitted. He went back to the prison; suffered the sentence for a few years and after three or four years, escaped to the other world following some ailments for which he had of course, received treatment in hospital. Looking back, I find absolutely nothing which affected my judicial functioning as the presiding Judge in consequence of the seat reform.
The reform was not Ripper specific. Even after the Ripper series were closed, the provision for bench in the dock continued. A Bench for the Accused and a stool in the witness box (not enough space for a chair therein) became a standard arrangement in all the courts where I worked subsequently too. I hope the ultimate verdict of the Madras High Court also will also be no different. Let us wait and see.
Tail piece: More food for thought. Should the benefit of seat be confined to the Accused? What sin has the escort official committed which should force him to be on his feet all the while? Is it that all his human rights should be deemed to be surrendered once he joins the police force? If during trial, the Court officer, the Advocates, the duffedar, the stenographer and the peon can be seated, should the security official alone be denied a seat in Court preferably, very near to the entrance to the Accused’s dock?

It starts with trust.Clearly behaviour profiling.
The purpose personality or behaviour profiling is not to pigeon-hole or stigmatize any team members. The primary purpose is to Identify different behaviour and communication style preferences. Team members can then Adapt their own style when interacting with others, and in doing so, Connect with them. This creates a good beginning foundation for trust.
It is amazing how often conflict situations are unproductive primarily due to style differences amongst the “combatants”.
After the trust is established, the team needs to define itself.

Reports in Scotland earlier in the week suggested the ex-Nottingham Forest chief was on a shortlist of six potential candidates to be interviewed this week.
Warburton has been out of work since being dismissed by the Reds on New Year’s Eve following the 1-0 home defeat to Sunderland at the City Ground.
According to the Sheffield Star, the 46-year-old former Reds, Brentford and Rangers boss has not been invited to an interview at the Keepmoat Stadium, as Rovers seek to find a replacement for Darren Ferguson who resigned earlier in June.
Warburton, since leaving Forest, has been linked with a number of jobs including at Rovers’ Yorkshire rivals Bradford City, themselves on the lookout for a new manager after Simon Grayson opted not to extend his short term deal at Valley Parade.
Former Bantams boss Stuart McCall is, according to the Star, on the list to be interviewed for the position and remains the firm favourite.
Having departed Nottingham, Warburton admitted he felt the job wasn’t what was originally advertised to him when he took on the task of keeping the Reds in the Championship last March.
."A rural haven tucked away on the edge of the Cotswolds, Field End holiday cottage sits on the Great Tew Estate.
It was a local nursery closure that prompted the idea for Field End, a stunning oak timber framed dwelling on the Potato Town site. Designed and constructed by furniture designer John, Field End became a nursery for his children. Pam & John gathered friends and family to hand raise the frame; an event which made national press and will go down in Potato Town history. As the children have now fled the nest, Field End has been transformed into a unique holiday let; ideal for those looking to escape to a countryside retreat.
A contemporary, open plan space, Field End accommodates four people, with exquisite rural views. Hidden behind the Potato Town studios and surrounded by flower beds and flourishing vegetable garden, Field End has a private decking area that looks out over meadowland. Wild hares and frolicking deer can be spotted amongst the wild flowers, as kites soar overhead. Guests are welcome to pick flowers and fresh produce from the gardens as they wish. Field End is the perfect private getaway, although Pam & John are working on site nearby and available to answer questions about the local area..
In walking distance from the nearest village, Swerford, Field End is just a 3-minute drive from the village of Great Tew and Soho Farmhouse. The ideal location for a tour of the Cotswolds, Daylesford Farmshop is a short drive away and offers a range of luxurious spa treatments and organic produce.
A car is vital in order to experience all that the area has to offer, however, there are two local train stations just twenty minutes from Field End. Banbury and Charlbury train station both offer regular services into London.

Betts expressed his commitment to and hopes for the Parkway. “Nearly half a century ago I fell in love with the Blue Ridge Parkway’s magnificent vistas and charming lodges, but I’m saddened that some facilities are shuttered and roadside overlooks overgrown,” he said. “The good news is that the Blue Ridge Parkway Foundation, working with the National Park Service, other nonprofit groups, and many individuals, has made a huge difference in the backlog of maintenance and building of new facilities. I’m excited about the opportunities ahead to continue polishing one of the brightest gems in the National Park System – the Blue Ridge Parkway.”
During the meeting, Michael Hobbs, director of communications at UNC Chapel Hill’s School of Education, and community volunteer Anne Barnes were honored for their service as trustees as they completed their terms.

If you know me, you know that I have an extensive nail polish collection.
I’m not just talking about having a few of the basic shades. It goes beyond that. Finding colours that I don’t already own is a struggle. The salon where I regularly get my nails done understands that struggle and they make it a point to tell me when they have new colours.
You would think that I am typing this with brightly coloured nails, but that is not the case. My nails are boring.
Bare.
Unpainted.
Naked, some might say.
You’re probably thinking “if you have so many nail polish colours, why don’t you just paint your nails?” I’ve thought about it countless times, especially during the pandemic when the salons are closed. I’ve even gotten as far as assembling all of the tools and opening my nail polish box, but that is as far as I get.
Why?
The choices are overwhelming. Having to dig through dozens of colours to find that potentially perfect shade is a daunting task. Even when I decide on the perfect shade beforehand, I still find myself confused and overwhelmed. So the lid goes back on and the box goes back up on the shelf where it will stay until I decide to go through the same process again.
The moral of the story here is that less is more.
Far too many business owners who rely on e-commerce believe that the more products they offer, the more their customers will buy. Variety is the spice of life, right?
Not necessarily.
Sometimes your customers don’t want spice. They want something simple and they want it fast. No one has time to wade through pages of products.
Our clients who simplify their e-commerce store experience see massive jumps in sales. You can experience the same increase in sales by:
- Reducing the number of products to a core selection
- Offering product bundles
- Simplifying the menu and filtering options
These three points can reduce the decision-making required from customers. If you offer too many products, the mere idea of having to choose can lead to customers to “close the lid” before they even make their choice. Overwhelming your customers can cause even the most certain buyer to question their decision.
In other words, too many choices leads to fewer sales.
The same logic applies to my nail polish predicament.
I used to have a stunning display case for my nail polish where every option was displayed strategically: by colour, by shade, and my absolute favourites were right at the front.
When I utilized this system, my nails were always painted. The only difference between then and now is how I displayed the nail polish.
It was easy to make a choice based on certain criteria and I could always fall back on my readily available favourites if all else failed.
If you display your products strategically and provide logical navigation options, this gives your customers the ability to easily decide what to purchase.
Whether you’re painting your nails or organizing your e-commerce store, the key to success is clear: less choice, displayed better.Jobs

BRITAIN is braced for Storm Henry to unleash 100mph Arctic gales, torrential rain and snow from tomorrow.
Britain is bracing itself for an arctic blast from Storm Henry, bringing snow and 100mph winds
GETTY
Most of the UK is on alert for gale-force winds with more heavy rain and wintry showers forecast across Scotland and the north.
Gusts are expected to top 80mph widely and possibly hit 100mph over high ground during the next 24 hours.
It will turn much colder with temperatures plunging to -5C (23F) in the north while hovering in low single figures elsewhere.
The Met Office has issued severe weather warnings for widespread gales and more than two inches of rain through tomorrow.
Spokesman Grahame Madge said: “On Monday the vigorous low pressure system – named as Storm Henry – will be approaching the UK from the Atlantic.

Strong to gale winds will affect much of the UK, increasing to severe gale and storm force
Chief forecaster Dan Suri added: "With several periods of severe weather forecast to affect the UK over the coming days, it's a good idea to keep a close eye on the forecast and the National Severe Weather Warnings.”
Yellow warnings for wind are in place across northern, central and parts of southern Britain with a more serious amber alert issued in northwest Scotland.
A further yellow alert for rain is out in Scotland with warnings melting snow and heavy showers will bring further risk of flooding.
Henry will be the eighth named storm to batter Britain after Gertrude struck last week whipping up 140mph-plus gales.

Around six inches of snow blanketed parts of Scotland after freezing winds swept the region over the weekend.
Thousands of homes were left without power while extreme weather ground roads and transport networks to a standstill.
Leon Brown, forecaster for The Weather Channel UK, said winds tomorrow's weather will be powerful enough to topple trees and trigger travel chaos.
Storm Henry on Monday will bring severe gales approaching from the west and 50ft waves
THE WEATHER CHANNEL
He warned severe weather will last through the week with heavy rain and damaging gales persisting until the weekend.
He said: “It will be another stormy day on Monday as a deep area of low pressure passes northern Scotland.
“Showers over the north will turn to snow over the mountains in Scotland with blizzard conditions possible.
“Strong to gale winds will affect much of the UK, increasing to severe gale and storm force over the north on Monday evening.
“Gusts are likely to reach 80 to 90mph and over 100mph across the tops of the Pennines and Scottish Mountains with travel disruption from fallen trees, bridge closures and ferry cancellations very likely.”

He said bitter northerly winds will plunge Britain back into bitter winter weather bringing hail, sleet, snow and widespread harsh frosts.
“Tuesday will be windy and colder too as winds veer more to the north,” he added.
“Hail, sleet and hill snow showers are forecast over the north but clearer in the south.
“The rest of the week turns wetter from the west, Friday to Saturday may be very wet across the south and central Britain with gales over the south.”
Storm Henry could bring with it fresh snowfall when it hits the UK

Heavy rain this week will put swathes of the country back on flood alert with torrential downpours falling on already saturated ground.
The Environment Agency (EA) has issued 54 flood alerts and seven more serious flood warnings across England and Wales.
The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) has one alert and two warring in place across the region.
Netweather forecaster Nick Finnis said Britain is battening down the hatches of another cold and windy battering on Monday.
He said: “We have another deep low arriving onto the scene for Monday, and it's expected to take a very similar track to Gertrude, very close to the north of Scotland.
“That means another period of very strong winds for Northern Britain, and with snow melt coupled with more heavy rain in the northwest, there could be an increased risk of flooding. Further south, not such a wild day, but still blustery with bright or sunny spells and some showery.
“As Monday's low moves through, it re-introduces some colder air, so like today, snow and wintry showers are likely to replace the rain across the north of the country, with the strong winds continuing right through into Tuesday.”PHOENIX (Reuters) - Arizona Republicans on Saturday censured U.S. Senator John McCain, the party’s 2008 presidential nominee, for a record they called too “liberal,” in a sign of continued distrust some party members in the state have for the so-called political maverick.
The resolution passed by a voice vote at an Arizona Republican Party meeting of 1,600 committee members at a church in Tempe, Arizona, said Tim Sifert, a spokesman for the state organization.
“Only in times of great crisis or betrayal is it necessary to publicly censure our leaders. Today we are faced with both,” the resolution stated.
It went on to reprimand McCain, who has served 27 years in the Senate, for “a long and terrible record of drafting, co-sponsoring and voting for legislation best associated with liberal Democrats.”
The resolution condemned McCain’s role in helping to craft a bill that passed the Senate last year that would provide a pathway to citizenship for up to 11 million illegal immigrants, which the state Republicans called “amnesty.”Is anyone feeling that Motorola still didn't give the full set of Berks and whistles with this thing?

You couldn’t quite put your finger on it but something was off. It could have been the service, the location, or just a general “vibe” you got. Ever think you may have been at a non-corporate licensed Starbucks?
Today I am sitting at one in the heart of New York University (aka Washington Square Park). What’s a licensed Starbucks, you ask? Basically, there are some locations that look like a Starbucks, taste like a Starbucks, and act like a Starbucks — but in fact, they are not. Hotels, universities, airports, and amusement parks are the prime suspects for these licensed stores. Target stores are a prime example. Obviously most consumers cannot tell the difference, and both Starbucks and the business want to keep it that way.
Licensed or corporate owned, this NYU Starbucks has me sold. Simply because it is a gigantic location filled with mostly empty chairs. You could fit 4-5 Midtown Starbucks locations in this space alone. The decor is pretty spot-on with standard Starbucks, and they even have framed black & white pictures of NYC hung throughout. This is definitely a great location for study groups or business meetings, and the fact that it’s in the southeast corner of Washington Square Park is just gravy.
Like I said, this Starbucks has me sold, but others may not agree. Since it is NYU owned it may not be as welcoming to those who aren’t students of the university like I am. For instance, it’s WiFi services are through NYU not AT&T — meaning you need a student ID and password to gain access. Also the hours are a major setback. It’s only open until 7pm daily. Do students not study at night anymore? Apparently not past 7pm.
The Good:
The Size… A whale of a location — simply giant.
The Seating… Seating everywhere — and not crowded together. This location is so large the seating can actually be spread out.
The Crowd… Not too crowded and very studious — what would you expect right?
Location… Washington Square Park — enough said.
The Bad:
The Hours… Only open until 7pm each day. Gasp! If any location in the city deserves to be 24-hrs I would think it would be the university location.
License not Corporate… If I have my facts straight, that means you cannot accrue or use reward points at this location
Restroom… Just one, and you actually need to swap your license for a key to access it.
WiFi… You need student access.
Barista Friendliness:
They may not be official “Starbucks partner” but they could have fooled me.
Drink of Choice:
Grande Iced Vanilla Latte… in other words, a Caramel Macchiato without the caramel sauce and stirred together.
Overall Starbucks Rating:
Longer hours would have made this location a 5-Cup — easy.
It wasn’t busy this week because it’s spring break… trust me that location gets insanely crowded.
That’s a very good point. I completely forgot about the break. I may need HK reassess this one later.Bink Tripel – Brouwerij Kerkom
9% ABV
Purchased at Pangaea ($9/10 oz. serving) and poured into tulip glasses
This tripel from Belgium-based Brouwerij Kerkom (they also brew a Bink Blond and a Bink Bruin) pours a mostly opaque hay yellow with a tight white head and a faint nose of bananas and candy. Warm, butterscotch flavors welcome you on the first swallow, with some yeasty tropical backing notes along with soft bananas. Bink Tripel contains none of the spice notes of the Westoek XX tripel, but the prominent banana candy and yeast flavors give it a distinctly dessert-like tone, and it ends up tasting a lot like Allagash Curieux without the barrel-aging process. More and more bananas and hard alcohol enter the frame upon subsequent swallows, but Bink Tripel is also amply hopped for a nice balance.
Now this sounds great. I need to get back to the Belgiums. I should do a review soon myself.

The writer was invited by the Public Service Commission (P.S.C.) and the U.N. Pacific Regional Anti Corruption (U.N.P.R.A.C.) to address a two-day meeting about Corruption at Hotel Millenia yesterday. He was asked to talk about “The role of the media in raising awareness to prevent corruption.” This is what he said:
Talofa lava and good morning! I want to say thank you very much to the Chairman of the Public Service Commission, Tuu’u Dr. Ieti Taulealo, U.N.P.R.A.C. and the U.N.D.P. for inviting me to speak today. I am deeply honoured.
Today I’ve been asked to say a few words about the “Role of the media in raising awareness to prevent corruption” and to “promote integrity” among the participants of today’s workshop, whom are senior government officials.
At the start, I want to say that flat.
Corruption though is not new. And it is not confined to public servants.
It was around before we were born and it has been with us since. To be truthful with you, I am unsure whether it can be prevented at all given mankind’s yearning to keep abreast with the changing world that involves material wealth, positions, power and money – lots of it.
In the media, our job is to provide a forum for public debate, which function is objectively and accurately, ask the hard questions and not be intimidated in an effort to determine whether our leaders keep to their promises to be transparent, accountable and govern in accordance to the principles of good governance.
Indeed, the media plays a critical role in promoting good governance and controlling corruption. Well-researched - in the private and public sector. is.
We’ve said this before and we will say it again, in our efforts to highlight corruption, it feels like we are banging our heads against the wall.
It’s a lonely path. What scares us is that when we find ourselves at the crossroads, when our minds doubt us, we wonder whether that silence can be interpreted to mean that perhaps our people have succumbed to the thought that this is a corrupt world and there is no other way.
That truly sends shivers down the spine.
So what do we do?
Where do we go from here?
Is there hope?
Of course there is hope.
And it begins with you who are sitting in this room today. The idea that the government of Samoa is taking a proactive role to prevent corruption and promote integrity in the performance of its officers at all levels can only be encouraging. It might be baby steps but they are positive steps nonetheless.
At this point, I wish to draw your attention to the words of our Prime Minister Tuilaepa when he opened this meeting yesterday.
“Integrity takes courage,” he said. “It’s commitment to doing what is right, no matter how difficult and challenging.
“Our principles of good governance depend on our integrity and being transparent and accountable is an important part of our public service.”
Wonderful words but they are not enough.
They will remain just words if we do not make a commitment to see it in action. Courage is an action word. It requires you to be proactive and raise the alarm when you see and smell wrongdoing.
This morning, I want to encourage all of you to stand up and make a habitual contribution to the effort to prevent corruption and promote the principles, values and integrity in this country..
Ladies and gentlemen, if you see wrongdoing and corruption wherever you are, don’t be afraid. Speak up and do your part. We are only an email, a phone call or maybe a coffee away. Soifua.

This is a perspective piece accompanying the study that I wrote about yesterday.
In some areas, like academic medicine, the medical profession continues to change at a pace slower than the world around it:
we posit that SGM* trainees and health professionals face discrimination in medicine and that these environments are ultimately connected to the inequities that our patients encounter when accessing care.
*The term SGM is inclusive of all nonheterosexual and noncisgender individuals, including, but not limited to, those who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender (LGBT), queer, or questioning.
In a recent survey of LGBT physicians, 10% reported being denied referrals from and 15% being harassed by heterosexual colleagues. In addition, 22% reported being socially ostracized, and 65% heard derogatory comments about LGBT individuals in the workplace.
There are really good examples given, in list form, of leading edge practices at academic institution. This list should not fit on just one page, considering the number of academic institutions that exist.
Very few academic medical centers are rated best places to work for SGM people
Very few academic medical centers and medical schools are rated in the Human Rights Campaign Corporate Equality Index.
For example, University of California, San Diego, which is cited in the perspective piece for having single-occupancy bathrooms, does not have a CEI ranking (you can view their lack of one here).
To see the difference of what it means to score 100%, look at Kaiser Permanente’s.
It takes a commitment to do this, one which our organization has had since the inception of the index. (see: Just Read: A perfect score for Kaiser Permanente on the Human Rights Campaign Corporate Equality Index again for 2015)
As it says in the piece:
Medicine should be at the vanguard of change and serve as a respite from societal discrimination, not as a haven for its perpetuation. Although these shortcomings likely are not universal, they remain inappropriately common.
There’s a rich opportunity for collaboration here, because there are parts of the medical profession that are leading change outside and inside of academia. Thanks again to the authors and the Academic Medicine for the reminder that the journey isn’t over.

Each year as SXSW becomes more popular and grows to provide more interesting and interactive venues, it gets much harder to keep up with it all. To help you get a better look at what’s hot, what’s trending and what’s not to miss this year, Mashable and Topsy have teamed up to turn the SXSW social chatter into useful insights.
Life According to the Twittersphere
The new “SXSW Trendspotter” is a mobile-enabled website that lets anyone see what’s trending at SXSW, based on real-time analysis of Twitter conversations.
The SXSW Trendspotter gives you up-to-the-minute insights into which topics are trending; start-ups, brands, bands and films that are getting the most buzz; sessions and events that are the most popular; and details about the top tweets, news, photos and videos around each topic.
You can see trends of the overall festival, or by individual categories, like interactive, music, film and brands.
It's hard to believe than only six years ago, Twitter was unveiled at the infamous music and interactive festival. During that time it's become a vital element of the festival experience enabling attendees to promote and share their experiences. This year, Topsy and Mashable hope to leverage Twitter insights to help guide those experiences more than ever.The.

Referred to as the color of passion, red is an ideal color for use in a bedroom to create a romantic and sensual feeling in the room. Whether you want to drench your room in the color or just want to introduce simple splash, this color to give your room a new look.
Color passion is not difficult to bring into your room through your bedding. If red is your favorite color, covers the entire bed in color-from bright red sheet to a deep red comforter and red throw pillows that feature red patterns. Bring in hints of color using just linen, which is red. For example, pop red sheet under a white blanket. Pink sheets with a blanket, covered in red roses to create a romantic look. For a bold look, try using bedding that are all white or all black and arrange red pillows and throw blankets on the bed.
Accessories are an ideal way to bring red into your bedroom space. Place red throw pillows, red vase filled with fresh red roses on your nightstand. If romance is what you seek, red light helps you to achieve it. Adorning the walls with works of art that has the color and may use red frames to house the art. Lamps covered with red shades cast a vibrant glow in your room.Angola, Sudan to ask for OPEC membership
Joining might boost influence of cartel, if it could adhere to quotas
LUANDA, ANGOLA — Angola, the largest sub-Saharan oil producer in Africa after Nigeria, said it will apply to join OPEC this month, while the oil cartel's secretary general said Sudan also was poised to join.
Mohammed Barkindo, secretary general of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, speaking to Dow Jones Newswires last week while attending a producers' meeting in Egypt, gave no timetable for Angola or Sudan to join the group, which has not had a new member since 1975.
Joining offers prestige but would mean adhering to OPEC production quotas — although members routinely violate the limitations. OPEC agreed in October to cut total production by 1.2 million barrels a day to about 26.3 millions barrels as of Nov. 1, and further cuts could be coming. OPEC controls about 40 percent of the world's daily oil consumption.
David Fyfe, an analyst at International Energy Agency, said Angola and Sudan could significantly boost OPEC's influence over global oil markets because of the added volume. But Fyfe pointed out the cartel was having trouble getting existing members to adhere to quotas, speculating that adding members would only make that more difficult.
Angola's crude production, most of it from offshore rigs operated by foreign companies, has climbed to around 1.4 million barrels a day but is expected to reach 2 million barrels a day by April. Sudan produces half a million barrels a day.
Angola's announcement on applying for membership appeared to have little effect on prices. Ehsan Ul-Haq, chief analyst at PVM, noted Angola would not be joining before March, and said "they don't produce enough to have an immediate impact."
Angola said in a prepared statement late Wednesday the application stemmed from its "growing role in the world oil sector." The southwest African country is China's largest supplier of crude after overtaking Saudi Arabia this year.
Foreign oil companies operating in Angola include Chevron, BP, Exxon Mobil and Total. State oil company Sonangol oversees the sector and awards operating licenses.
In Vienna, OPEC spokesman Omar Farouk Ibrahim said he did not foresee any problems with Angola's application, noting it has been an observer for some time and has attended OPEC conferences.
Three-quarters of the membership must approve an application, including all founding members — Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Venezuela.Interventions to reduce metabolic sequelae in rodent models of diet-induced obesity
IJMDAT 2018; 1 (2): e160
Topic: Endocrinology
Category: Review
Abstract
Obesity is one of the top ten adverse health conditions in the world and it has doubled in the last decades. Altered maternal nutrition, including both undernutrition and maternal obesity, have been shown to lead to transgenerational transmission of metabolic disorders in the offspring, perpetuating metabolic disorders in the future generations. Several interventions have been performed in animal models of obesity to reduce the long-term obesity-related sequelae and consequently the adverse effects on offspring’s health. Our aim was to critically review studies that performed interventions with natural/botanical compounds in rodent model high fat diet (HFD) induced obesity and to assess glucose, lipid, metabolic and cardiovascular outcomes. We carried out a computerized literature review using PubMed and Medline. We identified fourteen studies that fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Lipid profile, in term of adipogenesis, leptin, triglycerides, cholesterol and adiponectin levels, improved after administration of all the natural compounds tested. Glucose profile improved with the supplementation of rice hull smoke extract, rheum undulatum, zanthoxylum piperitum DC ethanol extract and alpinia officinarum showing an increased insulin sensitivity. Oxidative stress and body weight also improved after the supplementation with most of the compounds in rodent models of obesity, proving promising and effective anti-obesity properties. These experimental studies demonstrate that several natural interventions improve lipid, glucose and oxidative profiles in rodents presenting an obese phenotype induced by a high fat diet consumption. Clinical research could now explore the efficacy and safety of such interventions in the obese population to reduce the long-term sequelae of this metabolic disfunction and thus to interrupt the vicious circle that an obese mother generates a child prone to develop metabolic (and cardiovascular) disease in adult life.

When talking about social media marketing, there is always chatter about the ability to gain followers and enhance brand awareness with a focus on creating a community of engaged fans. At izest we often talk with our clients about the importance of leveraging user generated content to embrace their fans.
Across every industry, consumers are becoming less trustworthy of advertising and relying more on the opinions of friends and peers. This can be seen in the continuing rise in popularity of review sites, most notably TripAdvisor for the hospitality industry. UGC is helpful because it allows brands to adopt a show not tell a strategy. Fitzpatrick Hotels Group located in New York City could use their own images and words to inform consumers that their hotels are perfect for a date night. However, having recent customer relay that message creates a greater and more influential impact on future consumers.
Smartphones are becoming more ubiquitous in today’s world and the quality of the camera’s they house will only continue to improve. While photographers will still have an advantage in terms of quality that benefit isn’t as big as it used to be. Take this photo for example. It was taken by a young millennial shopper at Mirqab Mall. It’s an amazing shot and if you scroll through the Mall’s location tag there are plenty more. Popular brands can have access to hundreds of photos that are of good quality. It’s not an either-or situation.
Coupled with the ability to have good images is the fact that its low cost. Running a popular competition or campaign where the focus is to publish user-generated content can allow brands to have photos and pay a fraction of the cost of hiring a professional photographer. A great photo promoting FLiK’s Cinemas without having to do a photo shoot.
User-generated content has the ability to live beyond a brand’s social media channels. Fans can post about the channel on their own feeds to their friends and families. This in a way turns fans into brand advocates. If consumers are speaking positively about your brand on their channels, there really is no value that can be placed on the impact of positive brand sentiment.
Social media started out as a way to connect people. The first intention was not the massive e-commerce platform that it has evolved into. Brands should embrace the roots of social media and remember that content is for the fans. So give them a shout-out and show some appreciation.
We have highlighted the importance of user-generated content in the development of social media marketing strategies for some of our clients.Its cost effective, engaging and builds brand advocacy. If you want to enhance your marketing strategy to embrace your fans or looking for other ways to drive engagement then why not give us a call?

© 2019 Furniture in FashionI am likely one of the strongest opponents to what is commonly called “Digital Rights Management” (DRM) that you will come across. Given this, you might assume that I would be cheering now that all 4 of the major music labels – EMI (Britain), Vivendi Universal (France), Sony BMG (Japan and Germany) and Warner Music (US) – are selling their music online free of “DRM”.DRM being applied to content such as music has not been the source of the problem, so this change isn’t a sign of the problems caused by DRM are going away.The acronym DRM is being used for many things, some of which are controversial, and some of which are not. The form of DRM I am opposed to come down to technical protection measures (TPMs, sometimes called digital locks) being applied to two things: content and devices.When I am explaining DRM to politicians, I feel of which they are less aware that is the source of most of the controversy. The TPM applied to content is used to reduce interoperability to only specific access devices. Commonly this means encrypting the content such that a specific decryption key is needed, and then only offering decryption keys to specific device manufacturers that agree to limit the features of their hardware.It is not possible for a TPM applied to content to “make decisions”. It is no more possible for encoded digital content to “decide” not to allow itself to be copied any more than it is possible for a paperback book to read itself out loud. Either the content can be accessed or it cannot.The TPM applied to devices is where the decisions are made, and where most of the controversies are. LAFKON publishing made a video on “Trusted Computing” a few years back to explain the concept. Digital locks are used to lock out those who are not trusted. Computer security is all about the owners of the devices being able to lock out untrusted third parties from being able to access or control the computers. “DRM” is all about someone other than the owner, such as a device manufacturer, locking down the device and treating the owner as untrustworthy. While the identical technology is used such as cryptography, DRM and computer security have the opposite goals from the perspective of the owner of the device.Once you revoke reasonable ownership rights by locking the owner out, many problems will inevitably result. These devices will deliberately not be under the control of their owners, leaving someone else to decide what software runs on the device. That someone else can disallow the owner from using the device in legal ways, or they can violate the privacy and other rights of the owner. The point is not to say that these third parties will always violate privacy rights and disallow lawful uses of the device, but that the ability to make these choices is revoked from the owner and put into the hands of the device manufacturer.The purpose of the first lock is in fact to manipulate the market to encourage people to purchase locked down devices. In terms of current law, this is discussed in section 77 of our Competition Act which recognized that leverage market control in one area (such as the major labels historical control over a majority of recorded music) to manipulate a separate market (the market for home computer operating systems, and portable audio devices) would be harmful, and should be illegal.While this questionably legal technique should have been investigated, it turns out that the lack of interoperability between vendors has been harming the labels themselves. They have noticed that the tie between music purchased at the iTunes music store to the extremely popular iPod device has given Apple considerable market power. This has not only been driving people to Apple, but driving people not willing to purchase content that is tied to specific devices to competing independent labels and unsigned artists. I am a customer of eMusic and never considered any of the DRM-infected music stores that sell major label music.The major labels are now abusing this market harm to their own advantage by selling DRM-free music on stores such as Amazon, but not allowing Apple to sell the same music without DRM. The purpose is to allow the labels to leverage their market control to drive music fans to Apple competitors. This is itself a questionably legal market manipulation technique, suggesting the major labels learned absolutely nothing from Payola.Even if not a single piece of content was DRM-encoded, DRM applied to our devices would still cause nearly the identical harm. While the major labels are removing DRM from their content, they are still actively lobbying for legal protection for DRM being applied to devices, and are likely pushing in the back rooms for governments to mandate DRM on all consumer electronics.This shouldn’t seem far fetched, as this was already proposed by the major television and movie studios in the United States under the name “Broadcast Flag”. This would be a law that said that any device capable of receiving digital television must obey a flag that is added to the unencrypted digital television signal. This would mean that no device which allowed owner control over the device would be allowed — the concept of “no user serviceable parts inside” would effectively be mandated under law. The concept of owner override would be outlawed.As a software author, my business is dependent on hardware owners being able to make their own software choices, such that they could possibly choose my software. It doesn’t matter that I happen to be a Free Software developer, as disallowing hardware owners from making their own software choices affects all independent software developers.This doesn’t just affect software authors. It should be understood that innovation can effectively be defined as the unauthorized modification of the current state of technology. Any laws which disallow unauthorized modification are effectively chills against the very possibility of innovation.This also doesn’t just affect the marketplace. Once our devices are no longer under owner control, and there is no legally protected “owner override”, then many very harmful things will result. There are whole genres of science fiction that talk about the harm to society of this type of centralized control. Closer to our time, most of the privacy commissioners across Canada have come out in opposition to “DRM”.In the United States we have had Stewart Baker, US Department of Homeland Security’s assistant secretary for policy, suggesting in 2005 that “DRM” has national security implications when he said:
“It’s very important to remember that it’s your intellectual property — it’s not your computer. And in the pursuit of protection of intellectual property, it’s important not to defeat or undermine the security measures that people need to adopt in these days.”
Please do what you can to inform people about this problem. As a tool to help politicians understand we have a Petition to protect Information Technology Property Rights that focuses on this issue.See also the article in the December issue of the Open Source Business Report titled “Protecting Information Technology Property rights”.—Russell McOrmond is a self employed consultant, policy coordinator for CLUE: Canada’s Association for Free/Libre and Open Source Software, co-coordinator for Getting Open Source Logic INto Governments (GOSLING), and host for Digital Copyright Canada.Feedback

A man has admitted running a cannabis farm after plants worth up to £84,000 were discovered in his flat.
Ryan Malone had been detained by police who found bags of herbal cannabis and soil in a car, Hamilton Sheriff Court heard today.
Malone (36) admitted being concerned in the supply of cannabis and producing the drug at his home in Main Street, Uddingston, between June and September last year.
William Mortimer (39), of Carmyle, Glasgow, had his not guilty plea to the charge of being concerned in the supply of cannabis accepted.
Imran Bashir, prosecuting, said police officers stopped a car being driven by Mortimer in the early hours of September 5. Malone was in the passenger seat.
The officers detected a ‘strong’ smell of cannabis. They found four bin bags of a herbal material and nine sacks of soil.
Mr Bashir said Malone’s flat was searched and 141 cannabis plants were seized. Most of these were in a specially designed tent in the kitchen.
Drugs squad officers estimated the value of the plants at between £28,200 and £84,600. The yield would depend on various factors including how good a harvest there would be.
Mr Bashir said the value of the cannabis found in the car is not yet known.
Sheriff Alasdair MacFadyen called for background reports and deferred sentence until September 15. Malone, who has two convictions for possession of cannabis, had his bail continued.Project Description
The humble luderick is a fantastic fish to target, especially during the cooler months when they are at their most prevalent. During the winter they can be found schooling up in protected bays along the ocean rocks or inside the estuaries along rock walls, over weed beds and around jetties.
Their abundance makes them a very popular species amongst anglers young and old, and fish-a-cast sessions are not out of the question even during the middle of the day. On top of that, they put up a great fight on light gear and aren’t bad on the plate.
The author, Paul Lennon, with a pair of quality luderick
When and where to catch Luderick or Parore?
Despite all their attributes many anglers shy away from chasing luderick, because the way in which they’re targeted is a little unique compared to other styles of fishing.
The truth is that the art of catching these fish doesn’t take a long time to master, and as long as you’re set up right in the first place you should be able to get stuck into them right away. The first thing you need to work out is where you should be fishing for them.
While they love to graze on algae-covered rocks, a big part of how a luderick gets its food is by catching bits of weed flowing past in the tide. For this reason slack water is generally a slow bite period for luderick with the prime time being either side of a tide change when there is good water movement but not too much. Many areas less than a couple of metres deep will be too shallow to fish at low tide, but come to life around the top of the tide.
What bait to use for Luderick or Parore?
Once you have an idea of where you’re going to fish it’s time to source some bait and prepare a bit of berley.
Luderick are predominately herbivores, however they will at times eat a yabby, peeled prawn or even attack a big plastic or hardbodied lure. For consistent results, however, there are only two baits to use – green weed and sea lettuce.
This luderick was taken on a traditional float rig.
Neither of these can be found in the bait freezer of your local tackle store. They need to be gathered. Both are fairly abundant, and on any given day one can work better than the other, so it pays to have both at your disposal. Sea lettuce can be gathered from the ocean rocks on a low tide when there is little swell and are also often found growing on mooring ropes and around wharves. Green weed can be sourced around creeks, drains or at the base of freshwater run-off points.
The secret to finding luderick is finding a good source of bait.
Imitation weed flies are also growing in popularity and really do work, especially when the luderick are biting well. Weed flies can either be fished traditionally under a float or in the shallow water using a 6w fly rod and strike indicator.
A berley mixture consisting of either weed or cabbage mixed with sand can often help turn fish on the bite; throw a scoopful around your float every five minutes. A good little trick to prepare rather than sitting there with scissors and cutting up your weed or cabbage into small pieces is to leave it out in the sun so it gets get dry and crispy, then just crush it over your sand and mix it in.
Fly fishing can be a very effective technique if the fly is presented naturally.
What is the best tackle and rig to use for catching Luderick or Parore?
While there is nothing complicated about rigging up for luderick it’s very important to have everything right. By far the best hooks I’ve used for luderick are the Black Magic G10 and G8s. These Japanese-made hooks are super sharp and are the ideal pattern for perfect bait presentations, cabbage or weed. They also are the perfect hooks for tying your own weed flies on.
The essentials for chasing luderick.
I use the G10S inside the estuary and G8s for off the rocks, as fish are typically lifted out of the water rather than netted like inside the estuary. The larger size also has the benefits of being strong enough to not straighten out if you hook onto a drummer, which are a regular by-catch when fishing for luderick.
From the hook I run a short length of around 60cm of Black Magic fluorocarbon leader, using 6lb for estuary work and 10lb off the ocean rocks. This leader runs to a swivel with a short 20cm length of 20lb line attached to another swivel. The short length of line between these two swivels is where you want to add a barrel sinker, and the size of it will depend on how big the float is.
The aim is to weight the float just enough so just the stem is sticking above the water line and the luderick feels little to no resistance when it takes the bait.
The best mainline to use is a 12-20lb floating line, which won’t sink like normal mono line. This allows any slack in the line to be removed quickly when striking a fish as it’s coming off the surface.
Attached to the mainline is a float stopper to adjust your depth. It pays to play around with it when things are quiet, as you may find them feeding better hard on the bottom or higher up in the water column.
Centre pin reels still remain popular for chasing luderick, but threadlines, especially small Baitrunner styles, will also do the trick just fine. Your rods should be around the 10ft mark for the estuary and 12ft for rock work, and need to be quite soft in the tip as luderick only have small mouths, and the shock absorption of a soft rod helps keep the hooks in there.With Toys R Us gone, billions of dollars in sales are up for grabs for retailers
When billions of dollars are left lying on the sidewalk, someone’s going to pick them up. The only questions are who and how much.
With the all-important holiday season rolling in, the downfall of Toys R Us has America’s retailers angling to increase their shares of the market for Hot Wheels, Legos, Barbie dolls and the like.
It’s a tricky proposition. While toys drive traffic through the doors — a big plus for hard-pressed brick-and-mortar merchants — their profit margins tend to be relatively low, said analyst Paula Rosenblum, co-founder and managing partner at RSR Research. A retailer may not want to sacrifice sales in, say, women’s apparel in order to boost toy revenue.
“It’s all a math problem,” Rosenblum said.
Still, it looks like $3 billion to $4 billion is out there waiting to be scooped up. That’s about what Toys R Us took in from toy sales in the U.S. in 2016, the last year for which it reported financial results to securities regulators.
The company filed for bankruptcy in September 2017. It shuttered its stores this year.
Toys R Us isn’t quite dead. The firm remains in court-supervised reorganization, and its debtors recently said they plan to create a new company capitalizing on the Toys R Us and Babies R Us brands.
But while that’s a possibility, what’s certain is that hundreds of buildings across the country that formerly held large toy stores now stand empty, and billions in sales are going to go elsewhere.
Most of that money, analysts say, probably will be scooped up by the usual suspects — Walmart, Target and Amazon.
But Menomonee Falls-based Kohl’s also stands to gain — though to a lesser extent — and retailers not generally known for toys could pick up some side business.
Drug stores such as CVS and Walgreens will see some benefit, said Mark Cohen, a veteran retail executive who now is a business professor at Columbia University.
“I think that supermarkets are going to be showing end caps with toys on them that they might not (have) otherwise,” he said.
Meanwhile, party-goods and costume specialist Party City has opened dozens of temporary Toy City pop-up stores across the country, including one in the former Toys R Us at Madison’s West Towne Mall.
Also in the mix: Appleton-based Fleet Farm and Janesville-based Blain’s Farm & Fleet, similarly named but separate retailers that open large toy sections inside their stores for the holiday.
RELATED: Fleet Farm's annual Toyland tradition continues in Oconomowoc
“There are definitely some sales out there for grabs, but I think it’s going to be very aggressive,” said Brian Yarbrough, a retail analyst with Edward Jones & Co.
With Walmart, Target and Amazon probably splitting most of the former Toys R Us business, look for intense price competition, Yarbrough said.
“Anytime you’ve got Walmart and Amazon in there, you should expect pretty aggressive pricing,” he said.
Walmart has said it will add toy aisles in some stores and boost its online toy selection by 40 percent.
Target last week said it will add an average of nearly 500 square feet of space for toys at 500 of its 1,800 stores.

Amazon reportedly plans to publish a print toy catalog that would be mailed to households and distributed at the company’s Whole Foods stores.
“The big players are going to do to everyone else what they did to Toys R Us,” Cohen said. “They’re going to savage anybody else … being ultra-competitive.”
Toys are something of a side gig for Kohl’s. The company’s department stores average 71,000 square feet of selling space. The largest toy department among four full-size Milwaukee-area Kohl’s stores visited totaled about 1,350 square feet.
But the retailer has added Lego and FAO Schwarz toys to its selection. And retail analyst Burt Flickinger of Strategic Resource Group said Kohl’s will grab more toy business simply on the strength of the chain’s overall appeal to women.
“Anybody that’s got women in their stores is going to sell product,” Flickinger said. “Women buy at least 85, 90 percent of the toys.”
Robert W. Baird & Co. analyst Mark Altschwager sees Kohl’s benefiting from the closing of Toys R Us in another retail segment — baby clothing.
Babies were a big business for Toys R Us. In 2016, it sold $2.6 billion worth of goods in the U.S. for children up to 4 years old, including clothing.
With its partnership with national brands such as Carter’s, Kohl’s is well-positioned to capture a greater share of the baby apparel market, Altschwager said via email.
Even as the various retailers vie for more toy sales now that the sector’s category killer is gone, they’ll have to wrestle with more than price competition and tight margins.
Toys are the ultimate seasonal product, Cohen said. And while Toys R Us could hold onto unsold holiday merchandise for months afterward, department stores will want to clear shelf space for more profitable goods, which means discounts, he said.
“It’s a business that’s treacherous in that regard,” he said, “because the market for toys, which explodes at holiday time, disappears largely for the balance of the following year.”
Add to that, he said, the challenges of identifying the hottest toys as tastes change rapidly and the worry that the bubbling trade war with China could be extended to toys and drive up wholesale costs.
All of which suggests that, for retailers, toys might not be much fun. But on that, Cohen disagrees.
“It’s an exciting business,” he said.

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. —. Watson grew up playing basketball in Manchester, England, before later moving to Spain to play for a youth team. And after two years of basketball at Marist, he took up football for the first time at a junior college in California before becoming a sought-after recruit who chose Florida State.
He allowed just one sack in 12 games for the Seminoles in 2012, helping protect quarterback EJ Manuel and paving the way for an offense that accumulated more than 6,500 total yards.
Watson never saw himself as a football player, but he could soon be playing professionally. He was a rugby fan, although he never had enough money to play the sport, and a basketball player who was 6-foot-6 and more than 300 pounds.
He landed in the U.S. at Marist and often took a break from studying and playing basketball to watch the football team.
“Even when I was young, people used to always tell me, ‘When you go to America, people are going to make you play football,’ ” Watson said after Florida State’s win over Northern Illinois in the Orange Bowl.  made up his mind. Basketball, he said, had been his life. But at Marist, he was frustrated that the team was losing so much. Watson scored 4.7 points and had 3.3 rebounds per game, but the Red Foxes finished his redshirt freshman season 6-27. So after two years at Marist, he said goodbye to basketball.
“I really wasn’t enjoying sports anymore,” Watson said. “I wanted a fresh start.”
He found that fresh start across the country in Mission Viejo, Calif., at Saddleback College. Watson had never played football before. Never lined up to block anyone.
But he had little trouble with football. And in just a few games, the Division I programs were pursuing Watson. He chose FSU in January 2012 over schools like LSU, Oklahoma and Auburn.
He wasn’t sure how prepared he was and how things would go at FSU. But that first day went well at right tackle. And his confidence grew in the searing August heat.
“When I made the decision to switch over,. First day, it was faster and stuff, but you have to adjust.”
Watson adjusted. He was challenged by defensive ends like Bjoern Werner and Tank Carradine and, while learning from his mistakes, often held his own. He also found the coaching that he needed from offensive line coach Rick Trickett, who is well known for his tough love.
Trickett dished it and Watson took it. He knew that Trickett was trying to teach him and make him better.
“That guy is unbelievable,” Watson said. “The mental part of the game, technique-wise the guy is a perfectionist. That guy cares. The biggest thing for me is I try to care more than he cares.”
Watson and Cameron Erving cared. They had never played a down of Division I football on offense going into September. And they were sure to get beaten on plays by defensive ends with speed and experience.
FSU was going into the 2012 season with two wild cards at each tackle spot. But protecting Manuel soon became of little concern because they often held their ground.
Erving graded out at 73 percent in his final six regular-season games. Watson graded at 76 percent and allowed just one sack.
“Each time before we go out there, they are like, ‘EJ, nobody is going to touch you,’ ” Manuel said. “Going out there, running on the field, it gives me a lot of confidence.”
FSU’s offense certainly had its shaky moments, but the running game racked up a school-record 40 rushing touchdowns. And Manuel threw for 3,392 yards, the second best passing season in school history.
Offensive linemen like Watson can take pride in those numbers and the results: 12 wins, an ACC title and an Orange Bowl win.
Watson found happiness playing football after all. The sport that he once held in disdain is now one he loves.
“It’s been a special year,” Watson said. “I’m just happy for everyone. I’m just glad I could come in and be a part of something special. … It’s like a new beginning. I’ve been through a lot in my life.”Business Development Manager

MW2010 Program Committee Reviewing proposals
Proposals are now in for Museums and Web 2010. True to form, the majority of them came in right on the deadline. If we hadn't done this before, we'd be worried about having a program. But we know that MW is a 'just in time' group. At the final tally, we only had 35% of this year's proposals in-hand on the day before the deadline (compared to almost 50% last year).
Our impression was that more proposals were coming in earlier, but that's because we received a lot more proposals this year than last: 198 as opposed to 157 – that's an increase of 26%. Is that because being on the program is more important for travel plans? Or is there just more going on?
As usual, the vast majority of proposals were for Papers, but there are also going to be hard choices to make in Mini-Workshops, Professional Forums and Workshops as there are fewer slots on the program for those types of presentation.
Proposals are now being reviewed by the MW2010 Program Committee. Each proposal is read and ranked by three committee members. Then as Co-Chairs, David and I review these rankings and propose a program to the committee.
Potential Presenters are contacted by early November, and we hope to have the program online by the end of November at the latest.
Workshops are on a separate track, and we hope to have these announced shortly.
There's still a chance to participate in Museums and the Web 2010. The Deadline for Demonstration proposals is December 31, 2009. We'll also repeat last year's successful unconference sessions, so that there will be a chance to discuss up-to-the minute issues and concerns.
As always, we're interested in what makes Museums and the Web work for you. Leave us a comment here, send feedback, or drop us a note to mw2010 /at/ archimuse /dot/ com if you have suggestions.

CHRISTOPHER DOLAN / STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER Abington Heights’ Clair Marion (12) and Erin Albright jump during team introductions before the District 2 Class 5A championship Saturday.
With just two starters back and only one senior in the first five, Abington Heights might have looked like a long shot to win a fourth straight District 2 title.
So, Saturday’s 33-19 triumph over Wyoming Valley West, might have surprised a lot of people.
Just not head coach Deanna Klingman.
“I did. I did. I believed from the time I worked with them all spring, summer and fall,” Klingman said. “I believed. And they believed in each other, and that’s the difference.”
The Lady Comets’ journey continues Saturday, when they’ll take on Mechanicsburg (20-6), the sixth place team out of District 3, in a 6 p.m. game at Marywood University.
While the starters did yeoman’s work in the district final, limiting Wyoming Valley West to just six baskets, great preparation readied them for Lady Spartans leading scorer Toni Amato.
“We knew they had a very good shooter and a guard who penetrates a lot,” Klingman said. “That’s all we worked on all week. Our scout team did a terrific job at practice.
“I thought they were so keyed in defensively that their focus offensively was terrific. We executed. We were patient a lot of times to get the look we wanted. Credit to them, they worked very hard in the offseason to be here to put the pieces together. I’m just very very proud of them.”

Old Forge, the District 2 runner up, travels to St. Joseph’s Prep in Philadelphia, where it will play Girard Academic Music Program (GAMP, 6-16) on Friday at 5:30 p.m.
Susquehanna, the District 2 Class 1A champion, plays Millville (16-9), the third-place team from District 4, on Saturday at 7 p.m. at Dunmore High School.
Setting a tone
Dunmore defended its Class 3A girls crown, a victory that goes well beyond the four years the seniors have spent on the squad, according to head coach Ben O’Brien.
“It’s important to them and they put a lot of time into it,” O’Brien said. “And they haven’t just worked hard this year or the last four years. They’ve been working hard since they were in second grade.
“We have second graders that are with us (Saturday) who are looking at this, and they’re going to be here someday. It’s been something that’s important to the community, it’s important to our players and I’m really proud of them.”
Unlikely timing
Mohegan Sun Arena is regarded as a harrowing place to shoot, and the combined 29.4 percent from the floor combined for the 10 teams in the five girls title games involving Lackawanna League teams, bore that out.
But Holy Cross’ Caroline Kranick, Dunmore’s Alexis Chapman and Abington Heights’ Erin Albright found their range from beyond the 3-point time at clutch moments.
Kranick’s bucket pulled the Lady Crusaders within two at the end of the half. It was her eighth 3-pointer of the season.
Chapman came into Saturday’s Class 3A final averaging just more than four points per game, but stuck a 3 to help Dunmore to its biggest lead midway through the third quarter.
“Alexis is a very good shooter and sometimes because of some of the other scorers we have on offense, people forget about her a little bit,” O’Brien said. “She hit a huge one tonight.”
Albright buried a corner 3-pointer early in the fourth quarter to help Abington Heights turn back Valley West, the hit from beyond the arc just her sixth of the season.
Big shots aren’t always a 3. Haley Bestrycki didn’t have a basket for the first 31 minutes of Friday’s Class 2A final win over Old Forge.
But when given the opportunity, she completed an acrobatic up-and-under for a three-point play that gave the Lady Crusaders their first gold medal in school history.
“I’m just happy my team had the faith in me,” Bestrycki said. “I was praying not even to make it, but to get fouled. I saw the defender coming on my right side. I knew if I got into her, I could finish with my right hand.”
What would you do?
Scranton Prep coach Bob Beviglia had one of those situations where he could have just as easily been kicking himself as sharing a second straight gold-medal moment with his team, and he knows it.
Leading by three against Lake-Lehman with time dwindling, do you foul and put the Black Knights on the line to shoot one-and-one, or let them try a desperation 3?
Corinna Scoblick’s back-iron launch nearly tied the game, leading Beviglia to keep weighing his decision, even after the win.
“In this situation, the reason I didn’t want to foul is because of No. 50 (Madison Borum),” Beviglia said. “A lot of things have to go right for them if you foul. But I was afraid they’d make one, miss the second. She’s big. She’d get the rebound and lay the ball in. So I was going to take my chances on them throwing in a prayer and it worked out. But fouling isn’t a bad strategy in that spot.”

Recent Comments(The following is a story from Guam High Panther running star, and Ms. Earth Guam, Emma Sheedy’s journey from her first running event to what is now her senior year of running Cross Country on Guam. Emma is also a reporter for GSPN.)
By Emma Mae Sheedy
In Japan, the spring of 2007, a small girl came up to the start line of the annual Cherry Blossom 5k. At the age of just seven, the young girl had tears running down her face from the feeling of nervousness, as the starter pointed up his gun.
Bang! The gun goes off and that child got lost in the crowd. About 30 minutes later, that same girl came to through the finish line, winning 2nd in her age division. Little did that girl know, that event would change her life.
The young girl in Japan was me, Emma Mae Sheedy.
After that first race I have dedicated my life to running. The feeling of exhaustion coupled with accomplishment had become addicting.
After my first race, I helped begin a Running Club at my John O. Arnn Elementary School in Japan, where we ran for fun every other day. My love for running grew from there. Even without a coach I pushed myself to run further and faster.
I moved to Guam where I began running 5ks every weekend. This is where I truly found myself and the running community. I learned about pacing, training, stretching, timing and more through friends and family that enjoyed running as well.
In the 6th grade, I moved to Germany, where I was able to compete on a community and a Wiesbaden High School Track Team. I was the only middle schooler in the high school league. Having the ability to compete with faster, and more competitive runners made me fall in love with track. Finishing in 2nd or 3rd place in high school track meets as a middle schooler was extremely motivating and made me crave the feeling I get when I win a race.
Once I returned to Guam my 8th grade year, I began Andersen Middle School Cross Country. Competing against other schools every week during the season was a challenge, because I wasn’t use to running long distances. My middle school season ended successfully, ranking 4th overall girl in the All-Island Meet.
Over the summer going into my high school year, I met with Guam High School cross country and track Coach Taitano, and I came up with a personal plan for the summer. I ran more miles than I ever had, which wasn’t very much compared to now. Going into the High School cross country season, I was beyond excited and I was ready to take on every challenge that came my way.
Over the next three years, I slowly made my way up the All-Island ranking. My freshman year I was 6th; sophomore year I was 8th; junior year I was 4th; and this year I am hoping to keep the trend as top 3.
Finishing my fourth year of cross country, is bitter-sweet. I am the only one on my current team that has been there for four years and the memories I have made with my team during the practices, meets and other times will never be forgotten.
This season I am more educated on the importance of resting and not overtraining. I have really pushed myself this year and made some goals that I wouldn’t have even thought about making my freshman year.
I am currently looking forward to competing off island for cross country and track within this next year. I am also staying in contact with college coaches who are interested in having me compete on their team.
This cross country season isn’t going to be my last, just my last season with the Guam High School and Coach Taitano. I’m really excited to start a new chapter in competition, I wouldn’t have made it this far with Coach Taitano, my family and competitors.Partnership Highlights Commitment To Integrate Global Efforts To Improve Health Of Women, Children
In the Huffington Post’s “Global Motherhood” blog, Nicole Schiegg, a former USAID senior adviser and a strategic communications consultant, examines a partnership between the Every Woman Every Child campaign and +SocialGood “to hone new ways to curate the women and child health story through the power of innovation and new media.” She highlights an interactive discussion held last week at U.N. headquarters “about harmonizing the global women and child health narrative,” writing, “The focus of the event centered on how to build coalitions and integrate messaging to communicate results and to foster accelerated action in the last 1,000 days of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).” She highlights several panel discussions, writing, “Panelists viewed the many emerging initiatives as both an opportunity and a challenge. … They agreed this is especially true when it comes to accountability for results at country-level. The panelists agreed that a focus on country needs leads to maximum impact and progress towards the MDGs.” Schiegg states, “With so many new partnerships and commitments, consistency of message can be a challenge. Harmonizing among women and child health partners is not enough; we must take the added step to find new champions and to be innovative in our storytelling. I am confident that the Every Women Every Child +SocialGood event was a big step towards realizing these goals.” She concludes, “Stakeholders are committed, more than ever, to strengthening the global women and child health narrative, by working together and honing the power of data in new and interesting ways” (7/31).Description

Interim manager Paul Warne says midfielder Tom Adeyemi will be fit to return to the matchday squad ahead of tonight’s trip to Nottingham Forest.The Millers travel to the City Ground this evening looking to increase numbers to a squad that was hit hard with injuries during Saturday’s South Yorkshire derby against Barnsley.Warne though will be boosted with the return of Adeyemi, who had to be named as an unused substitute on Saturday, after suffering from illness on the morning of the game. “He will be fit and he trained today,” Warne confirmed to Millers Player yesterday.“He's still not 100% but we had a light session with the lads today and he wants to play. I'll have another look at him and make my decision on which way I play but he is available.”Warne has also received a boost on current stand-in skipper Richard Wood who appeared to be struggling with a problem during the back end of Saturday’s game.The rugged defender has shrugged off the knock, with Warne confirming that the former Sheffield Wednesday operator will be in his squad for the game with Forest.“He always picks up an injury but I kept asking if he was alright and he kept saying yes, but his face suggested otherwise,” Warne added.“He's fine and he's always a little achy breaky and that's why they've been in the Cryo Chamber to try and recover them for the game on Tuesday night.“I texted them all on Saturday night and thanked them for their efforts and Woody came back to me on Sunday and said he'd be absolutely fine and dandy. In fairness, if he wasn't in pain it would probably be a bigger problem, so there's no issue with him.”Whilst Adeyemi and Wood have been cleared to play, the news isn’t as positive on Aïmen Belaïd and Darnell Fisher who are both missing after picking up injuries at the weekend.“Belaïd will be out,” Warne confirmed.“He's having a scan tomorrow [Tuesday] as is Fish. I think Aïmen's isn't as bad as Fisher's, so I reckon he will probably be out 10 to 14 days. Fish possibly two weeks or three weeks but we'll know when the scans come back. “It's disappointing to lose them both, especially in the same game and we've been good this year with muscle injuries, so it's a bit of a shock really.”Goalkeeper Lewis Price remains sidelined, as does club captain Lee Frecklington but the latter continues to make rapid progress following an ankle problem, as Warne explained:“I don't think there's a possibility for Frecks to play.

“The pace of technology-driven disruption in transportation is not only changing how people get around but changing cities themselves,” said a statement issued by NUMO.
The statement continued: “Governments, companies, non-profits and residents are increasingly asking how to incorporate ride-hailing, dockless bikes and scooters, and even autonomous vehicles into their communities in the right way. NUMO will help answer these questions through innovative pilot projects, public engagement and experimental research in cities around the world.”
Robin Chase, NUMO's executive director.NUMO
Chase, executive chair of the NUMO steering committee, said:
“The pace of innovation and disruption on city streets is forcing everyone – residents, city staff, regulators, and the private sector – to rethink long-held assumptions. It presents us with the opportunity to correct current problems and remake cities for the 21st Century.”
NUMO is based on the Shared Mobility Principles for Livable Cities, which more than 170 companies and governments have signed on to as a guiding vision for more sustainable, inclusive, prosperous and resilient cities.
The principles prioritize people over motor vehicles. "The mobility of people and not vehicles shall be in the center of transportation planning and decision-making,” says one of the principles. Cities instead should prioritize “walking, cycling, public transport and other efficient shared mobility, as well as their interconnectivity.”
Cities should also “discourage the use of cars, single-passenger taxis, and other oversized vehicles transporting one person.”
Ani Dasgupta, head of the NUMO secretariat and global director of WRI Ross Center for Sustainable Cities, said:
“My hope is that together we will be courageous and audacious, learning from ideas that fail and rapidly scaling successful solutions. We know where we need to go; now we need to provide ways to get there.”

2002-06-22 04:00:00 PDT San Francisco -- San Francisco Police Chief Fred Lau said Friday that his family is the primary reason he is retiring from the force to take an airport security job with the U.S. Department of Transportation.
For starters, ever since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, his 7-year-old son,
Nicholas, has asked if Lau's flight-attendant wife, Barbara, will be the next victim.
"Is mommy going to be OK?" Nicholas asks Lau. "If something happens, am I going to get a new mommy?"
"I want to raise my family," Lau said after a news conference in San Francisco's Bayview District kicking off the department's latest recruitment drive. "I've spent more time with my Police Department family than I have with my real family."
Lau, 53, is a 31-year San Francisco police veteran who has spent the past 6 1/2 years as chief. That's a long time, he said, especially when he was often working up to 18 hours a day, seven days a week.
Besides Nicholas, Lau and his wife have 26-month-old twins, Erik and Zachary.
"I regret that I don't have another 30 years (with the department)," Lau said, describing his departure as "bittersweet."
Lau, whose last day on the force will be July 13, is expected to get the new job of head of security at Oakland International Airport under the federal Transportation Security Administration, which is taking over passenger and baggage screening at U.S. airports.
No official assignment has been made, however, and Lau declined to comment Friday on his new job. "I'm looking forward to the future, whatever the future may be," he said, adding he was not interested in becoming police chief anywhere else.
Lau tried to get the security chief's post at San Francisco International Airport earlier this year but lost out to Edward Gomez, the former chief of the California Highway Patrol in Los Angeles.
Lau said he has always been interested in aviation, as his wife is a Delta Airlines flight attendant who regularly travels to Europe.
The Sept. 11 terrorist attacks "really cemented it for me," he said.
Nicholas believed that planes were crashing into buildings "over and over" each time he saw the attacks on the World Trade Center replayed on television, Lau said.
Then there was the death of a close family friend, Betty Ann Ong, a flight attendant aboard American Airlines Flight 11, the first hijacked plane to hit the World Trade Center.
"Everybody was impacted in some way," Lau said. "I didn't realize it was going to be so personal."
Lau announced his departure one month after The Chronicle published a series of articles showing that the Police Department ranked last in the nation among big-city departments in solving violent crime.
"I'm not running away from any of those concerns," Lau said. Command staff will be assigned the task of finding ways for the department to improve, he said.
Lau will be replaced next month on an interim basis by Assistant Chief Earl Sanders, a 38-year veteran who has been mentioned as a possible successor. Lau declined to speculate on who might take his place.Wholesale to Restaurants & Businesses

On October 3rd 2018, Riviera Airport signed an agreement with ENAV, the Italian air traffic control authority, to install a GNSS corridor on its runway. Riviera Airport will be the first Italian airport to have a flight approach procedure based exclusively on this satellite technology.
The support of the Italian aviation authorities on this project is a recognition of the strategic role of Riviera Airport in the Italian and international business aviation market.
The GNSS on RWY27 will be installed by February 2019, while the updated obstacle charts will be published in “AIP Italia” by May 2019. The installation on RWY27 will further enhance flight operations and safety, RWY27 being the approach mostly used by aircraft landing at Riviera Airport.
In addition, ENAV will perform a feasibility study for the modification of the PAPI installation and approach angle for RWY09 (from 4.5 ° to 3.5 °) and for an instrument flight procedure (GNSS) for RWY09. If the analysis is successful, ENAV will proceed with the development of a GNSS approach on RWY09, including flight validation with a completion date expected by the end of November 2019 and implementation a few weeks later.
These important improvements on the runway should lead to the upgrading of the airport category and therefore open the airport to new operators in the business aviation market.

The long title of this post refers to a blockquote in the excellent piece by @BrynnTannehill, in the Huffington Post. Her statement in the piece is right, and whenever I need clarity on what’s right, Brynn is a person I definitely turn to. In general, I turn to someone who has lived experience, because I will never know what it’s like to be transgender & I counsel my cisgender colleagues to understand this as well.
I just reviewed her bio and didn’t realize that she’s also from my hometown of Phoenix, Arizona, along with Clive Jones and Monica Helms. Leadership must be in the flouridated water… I did know that she’s a former Navy Pilot who has served this country with honor.
I am delighted, in 2018, to live in the place (Washington, DC) with the highest percentage of people who are transgender in the United States, in this, the 4th anniversary of the most protective legislation of transgender people seeking medically necessary care to live as their authentic selves. I knew the result of the legislation would be meeting more transgender people living as their authentic selves.
What I didn’t know about was all of the incredible people who also know (and are much happier as a result) transgender people, as their children, partners, neighbors, nurses, doctors, therapists, community leaders who I meet on a regular basis.
Like literally every day.
Hey I was that someone w @BiancaRey! Magical moment when you realize you're in a room with people here to help the 🌐 learn to ❤️ better, aka the reason we are all here.

43% of Americans know a person who is transgender
According to an Ipsos poll done this year (@Ipsos):
- 43% of Americans know a person who is transgender
- The average of all countries studied is 30%
- 55% of Mexicans know a person who is transgender
Time is on our side.
The Health Professions are Much Happier if there are More Transgender People
Fortunately, also in 2018, the combined medical, nursing, and allied health professionals also talk about transgender people and are much happier if there are more transgender people as well, because we know, diversity allows the human species to survive, in a much happier, innovative way 🙂 .

For 26thyear in a row, the developers Dinko and Yordan Dinevi gathered in Mirage Hotel in Burgas the political elite of Burgas and Nessebar, public figures, managers of governmental and municipal bodies, friends and partners. The occasion was the 141th anniversary of the Liberation of Bulgaria.
In the spirit of the Bulgarian traditions, the celebration on the occasion of the 3rdof March started with performance of Strandzha Ensemble with artistic director Mario Egov. The chairman of ‘Bulgarian Memory’ Foundation Stoyan Raychevski congratulated the guests on the National Day mentioning that ‘we connect this day not only with our Liberation, but also with our union’. ‘I am deeply convinced that there is no better sign than the 3rdof March, which could unite all Bulgarians, wherever they are all around the world, so let’s rejoice, he added.
With a very emotional and influencing speech Yordan Dinev declared that he wanted to pay homage to the self-sacrifice of these people, who waiving their wellbeing gave their lives for Mother Bulgaria. ‘This is a sacred day, this is a day of Resurrection and before the Resurrection there was Revival – of the spirit, the Bulgarian might. This is a date of a seal on the map of the world, which we earned with much blood and victims, a starting point, which is only a beginning. Because I believe in all of you, I believe in the future generation that this starting point is the spring, which gives us our might. We shall continue to superstructure, to give to the world, because we are strong – by spirit and by heart, by blood and by root, which is holding us strongly”, Dinev added.
After the traditional folklore songs and horo dances, the program hosted by Bogdan Tomov continued with the performances of the legendary Burgas group ‘Four’ and the performance of Georgi Dyulgerov, Bozhana Ivanova and Zheko Stoyanov.
This year again a spectacular fireworks show lit up the sky over Burgas. A fiery meteorite shot from the roof of the hotel gave the start of impressive pyro effects. The fireworks were in the shape of fiery trains and brocade fans at nearly 450 meters height and for the final the specialist from ‘Fiery Marguerite’ had prepared such effects in the colours of the national tricolor banner.The annual Sunshine and Umbrellas charity fashion show in association with EY will benefit Cork ARC Cancer Support House and Breakthrough Cancer Research.

Every time we go I always order the Cajun Chicken Pasta. I just love it so much I needed to recreate it at home. I will say that there is some butter that goes into the making of this dish, but that’s part of the reason it’s so delicious. I think once and a while it’s alright to indulge in a rich and decadent dish!
Prep Time: 5-10 minutes
Cook time: 45 minutes
Ready less than 1 hour
Yields: 4 servings
Equipment: cast iron skillet and a deep sided saute pan.
Ingredients:
4 boneless-skinless chicken breasts
1-1/2 boxes of linguine
1 pint of sliced button mushrooms
4 seeded and diced plum tomatoes
1 finely minced shallot
3 finely minced garlic cloves
1/4 cup of dry white wine
3 tablespoons of olive oil
6 tablespoons of unsalted butter
4 tablespoons of Cajun seasoning
2 tablespoons of sweet paprika
1 teaspoon of Kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon of black pepper
1/2 cup of low sodium chicken broth
1/4 cup of heavy cream
1 cup of shredded Parmesan cheese ( reserve 1/2 cup for garnishing each serving)
Italian flat leaf parsley for garnish
Directions:
In a cast iron skillet, start by melting butter and olive oil. To the skillet add the finely minced shallot and sliced mushrooms. On medium heat, saute the mushrooms and shallots for about 3-5 minutes. Next, add in the minced garlic, and continue to cook for another 3 minutes. Add in 1/4 cup of white wine and let this all simmer together until all the liquid has evaporated and the mushrooms are brown. This process should take another 7-10 minutes. While the mushrooms are simmering and browning, seed and dice 4 plum tomatoes. Transfer the sauteed mushrooms, shallots and garlic with the diced tomatoes to the bowl and mix together.
Place 4 boneless-skinless chicken breast, that have been patted dry, in a large resealable plastic bag. Add 2 tablespoons of olive oil, 2 tablespoons of Cajun seasoning, 1 teaspoon of Kosher salt, 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper, and 1 tablespoon of sweet paprika to the bag. Let all the air out of the bag and seal it up. Using your hands, massage the chicken so all the seasoning coats the chicken.
Using the same skillet the mushrooms were cooked in, preheated on the stove on medium heat, add 1 tablespoon of olive oil along with 2 tablespoons of butter. Let the butter melt and move the butter and oil around in the skillet to coat the entire bottom. Next, place the 4 seasoned chicken breast into the skillet. Cook the chicken breasts for 5-7 minutes per side until almost tender. Remove the chicken from the pan and set aside for a minute.
In a large pot, start to get the pasta water ready. Turn the pot on med-high heat to bring the water up to a boil. While that’s happening, slice the chicken breast on the bias.
in a deep sided saute pan with a lid, start the sauce for this dish. On medium heat, melt 4 tablespoons of butter ( this may seem like a large amount of butter, but there is a lot of pasta going into this dish. The pasta needs to be well coated) along with 2 tablespoons of Cajun seasoning and 1 tablespoons sweet paprika. Add 1/2 a cup of low sodium chicken broth. Let this come to a bubble. Reduce the heat to med-low and pour in 1/4 cup of heavy cream. Whisk the sauce together, then add the sliced chicken into the sauce. Let the sauce and chicken simmer for 10-12 minutes ( enough time to cook the pasta), on med-low heat, while the pasta cooks.
When the pasta is al dente, transfer the linguine to the pan with the chicken, along with 1/2 cup of shredded Parmesan cheese. Turn the heat off and toss together until all the pasta is coated and the chicken is mixed through.The pasta will immediately start to absorb the sauce. Serve in a pasta bowl and garnishing with fresh Italian flat leaf parsley and another sprinkling of the Parmesan cheese. If the dish is not being served right away, place the lid.More than 500,000 car seats made by Diono have been recalled due to a risk that they will not properly protect children in the event of a crash.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reports in documents posted Oct. 6 that 519,052 car seats are included in the recall. Diono was formerly known as Sunshine Kids Juvenile, and the recall includes its Radian R100, Radian R120, Radian RXT, Olympia, Pacifica and Rainier car seats.
The reason for the recall is due to the NHTSA ruling that when the seats are secured only using the lap belt that children weighing more than 65 pounds will have an increased risk of chest injury during a crash.
"An occupant restrained using Type 1 (lap belt only) without top tether could be at increased risk of chest injury in an accident," the NHTSA reports in documents. "Occupants over 65 pounds using the harness could be at increased risk of striking the vehicle interior during a crash. Radian child restraints have a long history of excellent performance in the field with no reported injuries or deaths associated with these use modes.
"Diono believes relatively few occupants will be harnessed over 65 pounds."
There are 113 million more obese children than there were in 1975
A 40-year study of boys and girls from 200 different countries reports that the number of obese children in the world has grown by 113 million since the mid-1970s.
The cause of the issue -- discovered during product testing -- is unknown, but NHTSA documents point to a factory move that may have resulted in "new forming dies and plastic injection molds." The recall will start notifying affected owners on Nov. 22.
Diono says in the remedy section of the documents that it will send owners or dealers a repair kit with an energy absorbing pad and chest clip for free. According to a past news release from the company, that uses steel in its car seats, the Radian R100 has an MSRP of $279, Radian R120 $319, Radian RXT $359 and Rainier $379.Kansas Homesteading and the Timber Culture Act of 1873

Here are some inspiring ideas we selected for you. Let the adventure begin.Hockey: Rochdale Mens Seconds 6 - 4 West Derby
Date published: 05 March 2019

Peter Ransome (far right) scored a hat trick
Saturday (2 March) saw Rochdale Mens Seconds take on West Derby at Oulder Hill Leisure Complex, in what proved a thrilling match with Rochdale earning a hard fought 6-4 win.
Making the most of emerging young stars Aaron and Kieran Hunter, Peter Ransome and Sam Wilkinson in the midfield, Rochdale quickly got a good pass and move game going. After an early goal for West Derby for a 0-1 lead, Rochdale had to gather themselves and a move straight down the middle of a spectating West Derby defence found the talented Sean Carney who slotted the ball in from close range for the first of his hat-trick and draw Rochdale level.
A similar move allowed the dynamic top goal scorer Aaron Hunter to slot home for Rochdale to take a 2-1 lead. Rochdale now started to get a few attacks going again and the pressure paid off. A strong cross from right half was partially blocked by West Derby at D top but the ball looped up off the weak side and floated nicely to Dean Close to smash the ball in safely with a nice cover drive style shot, giving Rochdale a 3-1 lead at half time.
Rochdale started brightly in the second half with Carney finding the backboard with a reverse stick strike from the first penalty corner of the half. Almost immediately after, as if to prove it wasn't just luck, another breaking attack found Carney D top to lash it in with a hit from his reverse.
Determined to put up a fight and taking advantage of Rochdale easing off (not for the last time in the match), West Derby started to show that they did have some good ability going forward. Some promising attacks led to a series of penalty corners being awarded, one of which was expertly put away.
Looking to freshen things up, Rochdale coach Chaudhry started facilitating some good bursts from subs Mike Bohanna, Bradley Robinson, Liam Nutter and George Rogers.
Again Rochdale took their foot of the gas at 5-2 up and allowed West Derby to slowly niggle their way back into the game. They even had it back to 5-4 at one point, but Rochdale's attack started to rally for another goal. Some more threatening crosses started to fly across the West Derby D. With a strong one coming from the right baseline finding the talented young left half Wilkinson at the back post to provide a confident and calm finish beyond his years.
It was now 6-4 but it was still all to do with West Derby determined to score. They were constantly frustrated by a packed and clever defence that this time stood strong to see the game out, getting Rochdale a hard earned 3 points.
Vice Captain Graham Broadley said: "While we did switch off at times, I am immensely proud of the mental strength and resilience the team showed to stop a talented West Derby side with the momentum behind them and keep the game out of their reach. Everybody played well today, with some very good hockey played in parts. We look forward to playing Prescott next week."
The Flying Horse Man of the Match was Peter Ransom for doing an excellent job at inside forward in attack and defence..Gut health is so hot right now. Is this a dietitian’s dream or what? In all seriousness, interest in this topic is certainly at an all-time high thanks to emerging research that links a healthy gut to everything from improvement of digestive conditions (obviously) and immunity to obesity and even depression. Of course a well-nourished gut is also essential to general well-being, and ahem, regularity. Yes, I said it.
If you’re curious about gut-healthy foods and wonder how you can eat more of them, check out my top four picks here. Chances are you already have them in your fridge or pantry. That’s right…nourishing your gut isn’t just about downing shots of difficult to pronounce (correctly) kombucha or kefir; it can be accomplished by simply incorporating a few basic foods and plenty of water into your eating routine. Read on to learn more.
Oats: Nothing difficult to pronounce here…just good old-fashioned oats. A long-time gut-healthy food, oats are a source or prebiotic fiber that those live probiotics use to promote their growth. Think of prebiotics as ‘probiotic boosters.’ Including both types in your diet ensures that you are covering all bases when it comes to being good to your gut.
Yogurt: As basic as it comes. Before there was kefir—a smooth, drinkable, probiotic-rich yogurt-esque, there was yogurt. When choosing yogurt, look for the callout of ‘live and active cultures’ to know you’re getting the real deal. Also try to find the brands that have the lowest amount of added sugar. Remember that yogurt contains naturally-occurring milk sugar (lactose) so you won’t find a zero sugar yogurt out there. If you do, you probably don’t want to eat it anyway.
Bananas: With a carbohydrate and natural sugar content than other fruits, bananas seem to have gotten a bad rap over recent years…until now! Like oats, bananas supply the prebiotic type of bacteria that nourish the ‘good’ bacteria in your gut. The beauty of bananas is that they pair oh, so beautifully with yogurt and oats to make up the dynamic prebiotic-probiotic duo I mentioned earlier.
Aged cheese: While not all cheeses are a source of probiotics, those that have been aged, including Parmesan, Swiss, cheddar and Gouda are. Does this mean I’m recommending that you eat pounds of cheese in the name of gut health—no. In fact overdoing it may have the opposite effect and cause gut distress.
As seen with nearly all health and wellness crazes, once people get on the bandwagon as they have this past year with gut ‘healthy’ products like kombucha, kefir, kimchi and sauerkraut, food manufacturers respond with countless products to satisfy the need. While there are definitely some good newbies hitting shelves, there are also as many gimmicky products. That said, my takeaway for you is that it’s ok to stick with what you know like oats, yogurt, bananas and aged cheese in lieu of trendy probiotic drinks, cereals, snack bars, dried fruit and others that appear too good to be true.
Healthfully yours,

For more than 20 years now, Mackevision has been developing technological solutions for 3D visualizations. As a driving force in the digital transformation process, Mackevision supports and stewards its customers throughout the digitalization of their sales channels across all customer touchpoints. The brand’s promise of “Fascinating Connections” reflects the continuous development of its portfolio. Fascinating Connections builds bridges between brands and their customers. To this end, Mackevision develops the digital continuity required for brands to generate a seamless journey for their customers.
Mackevision CEO Armin Pohl believes that the company’s strategic development and the resulting impact on its portfolio of products and services are reflections of the zeitgeist. “With ‘to create reality’ we are launching into a new era of communications and this is reflected in our portfolio. By applying our technological vision and our efficient single-source publishing principle we create relevant and inspiring product and brand experiences that leave a lasting impression. As pioneers and partners to our customers, we are proud to give digitalization a tangible form and features by generating fascinating media content, opening up digital marketplaces, and developing and implementing innovative digital business models.”
Shared Studio VR: Virtual reality in design and product development
One innovation from Mackevision is significantly accelerating the digital product development process: Shared Studio VR is a platform that facilitates collaboration during what are technically highly complex and structurally challenging development phases. The exterior or interior design, for instance, can be visualized in real time, viewed by multiple users and commented on. Not only can the designers gain insights by interacting with the digital prototype, but the entire team also benefits from seeing each other’s reactions and feedback. This reduces the need for full-scale prototypes, cutting costs and boosting productivity, because at the critical early stages of the development process, Shared Studio VR allows everyone involved to contribute their expertise and make decisions.
“Designers and engineers can collaborate and look at their projects and products on a 1:1 scale, in a realistic environment and in real time – regardless of their location,” says Kian Saemian, Senior Manager for Business Development at Mackevision, explaining how companies can benefit from Shared Studio VR. “Today companies are facing the challenge of how to present new, innovative products to their customers quickly and affordably, while still making a lasting impression. In this context, our Shared Studio VR facilitates a standardized approval procedure across different departments at every point in the development process, in premium quality and at every location. Which effectively makes us a time-to-market turbocharger.”
Motionbox Designer Studio: Moving image library for the automotive sector
Launched last year to resounding success, Motionbox has quickly become one of the stars of Mackevision’s broad-based portfolio. A unique moving image library developed specially for the automotive sector, Motionbox provides companies with an all-in-one moving image solution with no need at all for live shooting. Tailored specifically to the needs of the industry, it enables anyone to step into the shoes of the director and efficiently produce high-end video material themselves for trade shows and events, product presentations, and much more.
Vehicles are showcased efficiently and effectively using a combination of high-quality pre-produced material and customized CGI, eliminating the need to invest time and money in the risk-laden business of shooting a film. Furthermore, once a film sequence has been created, a highly automated process can be used to update it with design changes, different configurations, product innovations, or even an entirely different model of vehicle with exact reproducibility. This frees up valuable resources to focus on the design process itself.
At Automotive Designers’ Night Mackevision will be presenting its new release: Tailored to the needs of design departments, Motionbox Designer Studio will offer the option of using CGI assets to visualize vehicle designs along the existing in-house value chain in live action sequences – be it to evaluate design variants during the development process, to support internal design communications, or as a basis for decision-making during the design approval process. The CGI assets include complete 3D data for streets and environments as well as information on lighting and reflections. If required, moving image sequences from locations that speak to the character of the product or the mindset of the target group can be used.
“Motionbox Designer Studio simplifies and accelerates the design visualization process. Design departments can draw on a complete data set that makes it easy for them to achieve photorealistic visualization of a vehicle for themselves,” says Volker Hummel, Product Manager for Motionbox at Mackevision. “It is our aim to help our customers set the perfect scene for their products and brands from the design process onward. As a reliable partner in the age of digitalization, we support OEMs during every phase – throughout the entire product development process and the customer journey – with a portfolio of products and services that is designed to master the challenges of the future.”
At this year’s Automotive Brand Contest, Mackevision was honored for its work on the KIA Stinger launch film in the Campaign category. You can find more information here.

In addition, NASDA’s NASS Program Director Charlie Ingram participated in the two-day session.
The NASS Michigan Field Office team did a great job of coordinating and organizing the event. It was a great experience which included discussions, team-building activities, and the development of action plans.
We stayed at the Bankson Lodge, which had a beautiful view of Bankson Lake. It is in southwest Michigan near the village of Lawton, surrounded by corn, soybean and grapes. Michigan has many microclimates which support the growth of more than 300 food and fiber products. This makes Michigan one of the most agriculturally diverse state in the nation. This means that NASDA Supervisors and Enumerators are always busy collecting data on behalf of NASS for many and varied agricultural surveys.
Some of the topics discussed at the retreat were: improving survey response rates, hiring, training, and quality control. One of the highlights, as well as fun activity during the workshop was the interactive team-building exercises which were designed to enhance communications and relationships between NASDA and NASS.Members of the Metropolitan Savannah Rotary Club presented the Greenbriar Children's Center with a check for $9,261.77 then helped students harvest the latest crop from the community garden Rotary built for Greenbriar on its westside campus.
The Metropolitan Savannah Rotary Club chose Greenbriar as its 2013-14 annual service partner. In doing so, Club members held two major fund-raisers for Greenbriar, built 20 irrigated raised beds on the Center's Hoskins Street property, and taught Greenbriar students the ins and outs of gardening.
Money donated will be used to help keep the garden up.
Produce harvested at the garden are being used in Greenbriar meals, and purchased by Savannah restaurant Green Truck Pub.
The mission of Greenbriar Children's Center is to promote the healthy development of children and the strengthening of families. The nonprofit provides services that include an emergency shelter, runaway/homeless, residential car, independent living, family preservation, early childhood education and car, and Project Safe Place.

“500% gain in 7 months! Here's how”
Stock market reporter Matt Krantz must be desperate for topics. I can’t remember the last time I read a story with as tantalizing a title followed by as much ridiculous “investment” rubbish.
Let me save you from wasting your time reading this drivel. Here’s Matt’s 20/20 hindsight driven plan for quintupling your money in mere months:
Pick the S&P 500 stock that will go up the most in the next month. After it does, sell it and buy the stock that will go up the most next month. And so on.
I will give Matt credit for mentioning the fact that these were “seven lucky stocks,” but nowhere does he state that pulling this off is about as likely as winning a million-dollar lottery (headline idea, Matt: (Learn how to turn $1 into $1million in just one day).
The point of the article is near impossible to discern. I’m pretty sure he wasn’t suggesting this crystal-ball strategy. Although his concluding sentence left me guessing:
“So don’t beat yourself up for missing these. Just remember there’s money to be made when others aren’t looking.”
Okay, and that means…?
I arrived at my own conclusion after reading (and rereading Matt’s essay):
Stop looking for investing advice in major publications.

The more we visit the Even Yehuda campus of the Walworth Barbour American International School in Israel (WBAIS) for various events, the library or the AIS Summer Program the more we discover the excellent qualities of this unique school
At WBAIS, we encounter the smiling faces of 550 children, from Pre-Kindergarten through Grade 12, representing 50 different nationalities. These children study in a challenging academic environment, receiving preparation that will support them in the future.
American standards
WBAIS provides an educational program based on United States curriculum standards and is accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools. It is one of only five international schools to earn the International Credential. Specialized programs accelerate English language acquisition, prepare students for challenging colleges, provide modern language instruction in Hebrew, French or Spanish, and differentiate instruction to address individual learning styles.
This is achieved through meaningful learning activities in a creative and positive learning environment in which students genuinely enjoy learning. A low teacher-student ratio of 1 to 10 promotes this type of excellent education.
The student body is comprised of international students from diplomatic missions, non-governmental organizations and multi-national companies, complemented by a host country presence of Israelis. This heterogeneous student body provides unique learning experiences found only in schools of this type.
Magnificent campus
Many articles have been written about the magnificent campus in Even Yehuda. However, reality supersedes the imagination – there is nothing like seeing it with your own eyes. The campus is situated on 74 dunams, designed to meet the needs of the students and to promote their growth.
While the campus is impressive, the most important component of WBAIS is a professional, dedicated and caring faculty who collaborate with students and parents to implement the schools mission. This mission emphasizes respecting others, contributing to the community, helping students reach their potential, exposing students to the broader world and instilling a passion for lifelong learning.
In addition, WBAIS continues its efforts to green the school. Projects include protecting the environment through the Ecology Club, the GAIA project (Global Awareness, Investigation & Action) and the development and cultivation of green areas on the campus.
Model UN Conference
From February 16-18, 2014, the school hosted The Israeli Middle East Model United Nations Conference (TIMEMUN). At this conference, organized annually by WBAIS for the past 14 years, the students develop thinking, analytical and speaking skills, as well as the ability to resolve problems through dialogue and communication. They also learn how to debate (in English) by simulating the format of the United Nations Assembly.
Students study the material for several months prior to the conference, which takes place over three days and includes 500 students from Israel as well as other countries in the world.
Education for Values is not just a slogan. At the American International School, the small classes, the professional, warm and caring teachers, as well as the attentive administrators in collaboration with the parents, make the school a source of inspiration and hope.
In addition to the main campus in Even Yehuda, WBAIS operates a branch campus in Jerusalem.

The ‘Horn of Plenty’ sigil is among my oldest and best known plant inspired sigils. It is an abstract vision of the dark flowering variant of the Indian thornapple (Datura metel var. fastuosa), which is also referred to as devil’s trumpet and cornucopia. have been blessed with a bounty of thornapple in my garden, which enables me to offer a sample of dried herb from the corresponding plant along with the artwork.
You can now purchase an original ensouled paper talisman with the sigil. The motif is drawn with black India ink on coffee stained paper, which has been infused with the sap from the leaves of my black devil’s trumpet (Datura metel var. fastuosa) and wormwood tincture. Each paper sigil is signed and dated on the back.
You receive an original work similar to the one shown here. Please note, that each talisman is unique and whilst the motif is the same, can have slight variations and differences in texture. The green color comes from the plant’s own chlorophyll and may change if exposed to sun light.

I know it’s very frustrating as a founder to be ghosted by VCs, to not hear back, etc.
But while VCs meet a ton of founders — they don’t do that many deals a year. When they finally have one they really want to do, you’ll know. They’ll want to close it that week, or at least, that month.
So if you’re not sure … assume a VC doesn’t want to invest. And it’s 100% OK to check in once or twice. Not 50 times, but a few times. Don’t stress about being ghosted, or not hearing back. That means you haven’t cleared the bar, at least not yet.
Just check in. See if they need more info, or more time, or just where you stand.

And that’s exactly what Wein did.
In July 2020, she filled out a “service request form” to get a consultation, according to police reports.
The website’s owner, Bob Innes, reported the woman’s request to the authorities.
An undercover officer posing as an assassin arranged a meeting with Wein, who offered the cop $5,000 to murder her ex-husband, reported WJBK.
“I can’t believe someone would think that a website like this exists,” said a Michigan State Police spokesperson.

ALLAMUCHY – Anticipation is rising for the upcoming debut of a new townhome phase that will introduce exciting new floor plans to The Meadows at Panther Valley, the new collection of value-packed residences rising in this well-established neighborhood.
Expected to be unveiled shortly, the well-appointed and expansive three-bedroom layouts will range from 1,900 to 2,800 square-feet, with prices starting from the low-$300,000s. Included in the new designs – which will provide two-car garages, two-and-a-half baths and a host of upscale interior finishes included in the base price – will be homes with desirable first-floor master bedroom suites.
“Buyers have been asking for townhomes that provide the added ease and convenience of one-level living,” says Elizabeth Bauer, director of sales and marketing for developer Baker Residential. “These new designs will deliver that lifestyle with a sumptuous master bedroom and soaring living space on the entry level, as well as two additional bedrooms on the second floor for children or visiting guests.”
The Meadows’s current housing phase in on the verge of a complete sell-out. Included in the available inventory are a selection of “Quick Move-In” dates this spring. The remaining residences provide upscale living with designer appointments found through the interior, including gourmet-inspired kitchens with granite countertops and stainless steel appliances, two-car garages, finished basements and master suites with volume ceilings, walk-in closets.
Panther Valley boasts a comprehensive amenity package that’s completed and ready for use. The suburban neighborhood provides two sparkling lakes, three beautiful pools, a wealth of tennis and basketball courts, tot lots. The 18-hole Panther Valley Golf & Country Club located within the gated Panther Valley community is available on a membership basis.
The Meadows is close to major transportation outlets. Interstate 80 lies just outside Panther Valley’s front gate, providing easy access to highways such as Routes 10 and Interstates 287 and 78.
The Meadows sales office is open daily from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. For additional information, call 908-852-0016 or visit.
Baker Residential creates homes that provide “A Difference You Can See” with everlasting value, thanks to attention-to-detail, high quality materials, fine craftsmanship and a long roster of standard designer interior features and finishes. Distinctive exterior architectural details on each Baker residence create streetscape of great variety and flair, with ample sidewalks and lush landscaping to provide a welcoming environment.

Last time, Yoshino made an unsuccessful attempt to return to Tokyo. From the looks of it, she changed her mind, but still wishy-washy on committing herself to take the role as queen. Mr. Kodota happened to ordered 1000 cases of Chupakabura Manju instead of 10. It’s her job to sell all of them in one week. He makes a deal if she accomplishes this task, he will void the contract and she can go back home.
From the looks of it, it’s easier said than done and selling all 1000 boxes is nearly impossible. Yoshino and Shiori asks Maki how many people they need to sell it to. As expected, it’s not an easy task. Yoshino and Shiori eventually goes to a restaurant, which led them to a sweet shop where Shiori’s friend, Riri lives. They want to learn more about Chupakabura to create some marketing materials.
Eventually, they decided on a website and asked a website designer, Sanae. It’s funny how she wants to move to the countryside when she is afraid of bugs. Eventually, she agreed to help them create a website to market the product. They decide on a simple with a fancyccult design. Sanae worked through the night to create the site.
After much preparation, it seems that the website didn’t attract much attention. To make matters worse, they only got 76 hits. I guess it’s a bit too early to tell. Sanae improved it by adding Yoshino’s endorsement. That only garnered three sales, mostly from Shiori’s whole family out of pity. It looks like if Yoshino is about to give up. Thankfully, Maki suggested a video promotion, which is hundred times more effective.
With that, it looks like the girls are having fun filming the promotion video. I have to admit, it’s a funny commercial and the video became fairly popular. Sadly, it didn’t translate to sales. They only got one sale thus Yoshino failed her first task. In other words, Yoshino has to uphold her side of the bargain and finish the duties of the contract she signed. At least not everything is lost. She got to work with Maki, Sanae, and Riri and even had some fun making the promotional video.
In the end, Maki asks an interesting question. She asks what Tokyo has in it for Yoshino. As expected, she says everything. Is that true? When Yoshino asks Sanae on why she left, it’s obvious that Sanae got tired of the city. Moreover, she doesn’t need to be there to make a living. It’s quite obvious that the city is not the only place to find jobs. Maybe it’s true that Yoshino is being a bit too picky. There are opportunities everywhere if Yoshino is willing to take it. ¶

HOUSES OF BENEDICTINE NUNS
5. SOPWELL PRIORY
The Benedictine nunnery of St. Mary of Sopwell, near St. Albans, is said by Matthew Paris to have owed its foundation to the building by Geoffrey, sixteenth Abbot of St. Albans (1119-46), of a cell and houses for two holy women who had settled near Eywood about 1140 in rough shelters made of branches of trees wattled together. (fn. 1) His account cannot be altogether correct, for the cell first occupied by the convent was an ankerhold repaired or rebuilt by a recluse named Roger. (fn. 2) Still, the house apparently arose in Geoffrey's time, (fn. 3) and as very early in its history it became dependent on St. Albans, the abbot was probably concerned in its foundation, (fn. 4) with the object no doubt of accommodating the nuns who existed at St. Albans Abbey through the Saxon period down to about this date.
While Geoffrey was abbot the cemetery of the nuns was consecrated by Bishop Alexander, probably Alexander Bishop of Lincoln (1123-48), and it was then ordained that without the consent of the abbot none might enter the convent, the number of which was limited to thirteen. (fn. 5) Geoffrey is also said to have directed that the nuns for their safety and good name were to be locked in at night under the abbot's seal, and that maidens only were to be received into the community. (fn. 6)
Among the earliest grants to Sopwell were those of Henry de Albini (fn. 7) and his son, the former giving in frankalmoign 2 hides of land in his manor of Cotes, in Cardington parish, co. Bedford, (fn. 8) and the other adding a virgate in the same place when his sister Amicia became a nun at Sopwell (fn. 9); Roland de Dinan's gift to the nuns of half a hide in Ickleford; Richard de Tany's (fn. 10) grant of land called Black Hide in the soke of Tyttenhanger (fn. 11); that of Hugh de Keynes (fn. 12) of a hide in Croughton, co. Northants. (fn. 13) Other benefactions included assarted land in Shenley, (fn. 14) the yearly allowance of 50s. from the issues of Hertfordshire, granted in 1247 by Henry III to support a chaplain celebrating daily the mass of the Virgin, (fn. 15) a rent of 5s. in West Wycombe received in 1281 (fn. 16) from Henry de Norwyco, whose daughter Philippa was a nun at Sopwell in February 1266-7, and was then promised by Abbot Roger the first livery to fall vacant of the three called the Maundy of St. Mary, delivered daily from the abbey's refectory and kitchen. (fn. 17)
The convent, apparently not satisfied with its dependent position, on one occasion tried to elect the prioress. On the death of Prioress Philippa, c. 1330, they talked the matter over among themselves, and the majority decided on Sister Alice de Hakeneye. (fn. 18) The Abbot of St. Albans hearing what had occurred sent Nicholas de Flamstede, the prior, to the priory unexpectedly. He said that although the abbot had the right to select their head he wished to hear their opinions, and asked each to state her choice in writing. Sixteen and more gave their votes for Alice de Hakeneye, about three for the sub-prioress, Alice de Pekesden. Nicholas, however, by previous instructions from the abbot, declared Alice de Pekesden prioress and installed her. She was probably indeed the best fitted for the post, for she is said to have been more zealous for religion than all the rest.
A glimpse of the state of the house twenty years later is afforded by the injunctions issued by Abbot Michael in 1338 after a visitation. (fn. 19) These order that the nuns were to sing the mass of St. Alban once a week with a few exceptions; that no sister undergoing the penance of silence was to be debarred from religious exercises or from seeing mass celebrated; that the custom of the chaplain of our Lady to help the confessor at certain services was to be observed; that when it was time to rise the sub-prioress was to ring the bell in the quire and no one was to leave the dormitory before without permission, all must then get up and attend the mass of our Lady, and after this sit in the cloister occupied with their private devotions until Prime, at which all except the sick were to be present, then they should attend the chapter and in the interval until their meal go about their work; the doors of the garden and parlour were to be closed when curfew was sounded at the abbey, and the door of the garden should not be opened before Prime; that in chapter only three persons should speak—the president, sub-prioress or her substitute, and the sister charged with an offence; those disobedient to the prioress in chapter were to be put on bread and water for the day; that all who broke the silence ordered by their rule should acknowledge their fault in chapter and receive regular discipline, and if they did not do so voluntarily they should be charged by the guardian of the order and have the hardest penance; that those who quarrelled and thus created disorder should not be spoken to and be in penance for three days; that the sisters were not to come into the parlour to speak to secular persons except with neck and face covered with kerchief and veil as ordained by their order; that only persons of good same were to be allowed to enter the priory and were never to eat in the nuns' rooms without the abbot's special permission; that workpeople such as tailors and furriers employed at the priory must be respectable, and should have a place near the cloister set apart for them, and were never to be called into the rooms; that nuns who were ill were to be in the infirmary according to the custom formerly observed; the prioress was forbidden to give leave to the nuns to remain with guests for the night and the dormitory was to be occupied by the sisters only. These rules perhaps suggest precautionary measures rather than indicate great lack of discipline.
The orders given by Abbot Thomas (fn. 20) (1349-96) to the Warden or Master of Sopwell show the necessity of more care: henceforth no man, secular or regular, was to be allowed to enter the nunnery without the abbot's permission, and then not before Prime had been sung, and he was not to stay after the bell had been rung for supper at St. Albans; and the master himself was always to enter and leave in the company of others and not to remain longer than the time fixed above, except in special circumstances.
There are occasional references to individual nuns that are not without interest. Agnes Paynel figures in the Book of Benefactors of St. Albans (fn. 21) for her gift of three copes with beautiful orphreys, chasuble, tunic and dalmatic of black satin, powdered with stars and the letters A and Pin gold, for her monetary contributions to various works of the abbey and a gold ring offered to St. Alban's shrine. Letitia Wyttenham, prioress 1418-35, also ranked as a benefactor (fn. 22) on account of her industry in embroidering and mending the vestments of St. Albans. Cecilia Paynel and Margaret Euer, nuns of Sopwell, were admitted to the fraternity of St. Albans in 1428 on the same day as the Earl of Warwick's household. (fn. 23) Lady Margaret Wynter made regular profession at Sopwell in June 1429, (fn. 24) and offered a girdle enriched with precious stones worth 10 marks. (fn. 25) Two more nuns mentioned in the 15th century were of London citizen families, and received bequests, the one (fn. 26) of a mark, the other (fn. 27) of 2 marks a year.
Visitors of high rank were not uncommon at the time of Margaret Wynter's admission. The Duke of Gloucester in 1427 and Cardinal Beaufort in 1428 called at the nunnery on their way from St. Albans to Langley, (fn. 28) and the Duchess of Clarence was apparently staying at Sopwell in 1429, when she was received into the fraternity of St. Albans. (fn. 29) One of the convent's guests was the cause of an alarming attack on the priory in 1428. (fn. 30) William Wawe, the famous robber-captain, expecting to find a certain Eleanor Hulle (fn. 31) there, broke into the place with his men one night. After terrifying the nuns with threats they began to plunder, when hue and cry was raised by an energetic man in the village, (fn. 32) and the robbers made off.
Abbot William Wallingford on 8 March 1480-1 commissioned John Rothbury, the archdeacon, and Thomas Ramrugge, sub-prior of St. Albans, to visit the house of Sopwell and remove the prioress, Joan Chapel, from her office on account of her age and infirmities, putting Elizabeth Webbe in her place. (fn. 33) The abbot must have regretted his choice afterwards. When Rothbury some years later deposed her she brought an action against him in the Court of Arches and was reinstated. Upon this two monks of St. Albans, sent by Rothbury, came to the nunnery, broke down Elizabeth's door with an iron bar, beat her and put her in prison. (fn. 34) She then appealed to the Archbishop of Canterbury as chancellor, (fn. 35) and it can hardly be doubted that she was the authority for some of Morton's charges against St. Albans. In his letter to the abbot, 5 July 1490, (fn. 36) he accused him of changing the prioresses not only at Pré but at Sopwell as he pleased, and deposing the good and religious for the benefit of the evil and vicious, so that religion was cast down and needless expense caused. He also said that the monks put in as wardens used their opportunities to dissipate the goods of these houses, and he no doubt had grounds for his statement. In 1500-1 Elizabeth Prioress of Sopwell, probably the same Elizabeth Webbe, complained to the chancellor (fn. 37) that a deed of lease by the convent had been secretly altered to their disadvantage by Thomas Holgrave, keeper of the priory, and his clerk, who had been bribed by the tenant.
The house was dissolved in March or April 1537 (fn. 38) under the Act of 1536. Very different reports of Sopwell were given by John ap Rice in October 1535, (fn. 39) and the commissioners sent to receive the surrender in March 1537, (fn. 40) the first telling Cromwell that, as he would see by the 'comperta,' it would be well to suppress the priory, the others declaring that the five nuns composing the convent were of good character.
There were then two children living at the priory, probably for instruction by the nuns. (fn. 41)
A pension of £6 a year was assigned to the prioress, Joan Pygot (fn. 42); the other nuns, a priest and four servants received £10 5s. 8d. among them. (fn. 43) The buildings, which were in a fair state of repair, contained little of much value beyond the lead on the roofs, priced at £40, and the four bells, reckoned at £18. (fn. 44) The plate consisted of a silver-gilt chalice and paten weighing 14 oz. (fn. 45) The furniture of the church, (fn. 46) including an alabaster table, the hanging of the quire, two altar frontals, (fn. 47) and a copper cross, was sold for £1 15s. 6d.; the timber-work of the quire for 40s.; the stone in the church with the vestry staff for 60s.; and the stuff in the parlour for 10s. (fn. 48)
The net income of the priory was reckoned in the Valor of 1535 at £40 7s. 10d., (fn. 49) at the suppression at £46. (fn. 50)

Symbio’s knowledge in quality assurance has been built in a wide variety of co-creation projects in the areas of Connected Devices, Industrial Internet and Automotive. Symbio has created a unique Total QA model, which shifts quality assurance actions as early as possible in the project, leading to improved risk management based on the metrics provided by early QA involvement. The Symbio RATA (Robot Aided Test Automation) framework is powered by OptoFidelity Touch & Test™ Robotics. This unique combination utilizes the best practices of Total QA enabling full-scale testing and measurement services for any client’s R&D organizations.
- “The results from the Robot Aided Test Automation projects delivered to our global customers have shown the potential to us”’ Jacob Hsu, CEO of Symbio, says.
- “We have seen, that the market for these systems is growing. We believe this cooperation is offering real value to our customers. Shorter testing lifecycle, with more reliable and objective data. This is the direction of Total QA, as we see it.”, CEO Jacob Hsu concludes.
OptoFidelity has developed groundbreaking innovations for User Interface performance testing. OptoFidelity´s robot aided, non-intrusive, automated testing systems are especially used to improve product quality and to speed up R&D. The company has an extensive track record in the mobile sector. The interest for non-intrusive, automatic methods has started to grow after the takeoff of novel Human-Machine Interface methods.
The two companies have started the cooperation a few years ago in mutual global customer projects. In these early projects, OptoFidelity introduced its novel testing systems. Customers were able to speed up their R&D processes due to significantly shorter testing cycle, with much better accuracy and reporting features. Symbio was their customer’s partner for testing process & QA with Symbio´s testing framework. Symbio offers a portfolio of QA services, which are based on Symbio Total QA framework.
Together, the companies have created a common cooperation model and integrated the OptoFidelity Human simulator environment with Symbio’s TotalQA framework.
- We know, that we are clear leaders in non-intrusive testing of touch enabled devices
- The same UX methods that have been introduced in the mobile sector will now quickly spread to automotive, wearables and other product categories. Human-like testing with automation is the future.
- “If you can touch it, we can test it” has been our slogan, Pertti Aimonen, CEO of OptoFidelity notes. “And now with this co-operation, our value proposal is available to even larger customer segments.”

Thank you for staying with us and leaving the great review. I will be sure to let all the staff know how well they did.
Everything about the hotel was great except the expensive parking and the elevator emergency line. The company that controls the emergency calls is not part of the hotel. We were told somebody is working on the elevator right now. An hour and a half later, we pried the door open ourselves to find out nobody had any sweet clue what we were doing.
Very sorry to here about this. the elevator company was informed, but this happened on the weekend after hours which normally takes them a little longer to arrive on site. I'm very sorry you had to experience this and would like to make it up to you if you plan on coming back and staying with us.
The Homewood Suites is a solid choice. It is walking distance of downtown Halifax and the harbourside. The suites offer a lot more comfort than a hotel room. The free breakfast was okay (it wasn't the usual paper plate type that Canada excels at). The free wifi was reasonably fast (there is a pay upgrade option). The parking is not free.
Thank you for staying with us and leaving a review. we do take great pride in our room size as well as what is served during breakfast and what it is served on. as for the parking we are average to below average for the rate that is charged at most hotels and parking structures in Halifax.
Easy and fast check in, nicely appointed full suites, very clean and good beds.
Excellent associates and the breakfast was very impressive. The dining area was large and very busy. Nice added touch with the fireplace and lounge type seating.
Thank you for staying with us and leaving a review. We are glad you enjoyed your stay, and hope to see you back again
Overall experience was very good except for Complimentary dinner.Cleaness of hotel, room facility,internet,staff behavior everything was up to the mark.
I also see the exhibiton into the hotel.
The everyday room service was very nice.
Gym was cool,swimming pool size was little small
Rest all was very good.
Thank You
Thank you for staying with us, and leaving a review. Were happy to hear you enjoyed your stay, and hope to see you back again
This was the third time I had stayed at this particular hotel. It has a great location, and the staff is professional and friendly. The breakfast offered a wide variety of foods to satisfy any kind of dietary restrictions. The rooms are large, with a full size fridge, stove, dishwasher and all the utensils a person might require to do their own cooking.
Thank you for staying with us again, we hope this will not be the last time. We do take great pride in the size of the rooms and the items served at breakfast as well as the amenities that are in the room. Hope you have a great daySaving towards a down payment for a mortgage is the first major step towards buying a home. It requires the discipline to put aside the money, obviously, as well as a decision on where best to store those funds.
How Much You'll Need to Save
When granting a mortgage, a bank requires a down payment to help reduce its risk in financing the remaining cost of the home.
Banks prefer borrowers who can pony up at least a fifth of a home's asking price. If you have excellent credit or qualify for certain programs, you may be able to secure a loan with less than 20% down, or even with no down payment at all. Keep in mind, though, that the programs that offer low or no down payment usually require the borrower to pay private mortgage insurance (PMI) at an additional monthly cost.
Conversely, if you're deemed to be a high-risk borrower, because of your credit history or other factors, the bank may seek a higher percentage of the home's value as a down payment before they'll grant the mortgage.
[Important: Whether to use a bank, an online bank, or the stock market to stash those tens of thousands of down-payment dollars depends on your timeline.]
You're free to opt for a down payment of more than 20% of the home's value if you have the money available. The bigger the down payment, after all, the smaller the mortgage and the less onerous its monthly payments. (To calculate the numbers involved, you can use a loan amortization schedule.)
Best Places To Keep Your Down Payment
The money for a down payment needs to be accessible easily and quickly, which all but rules out such options as a long-term certificate of deposit (CD). It also should be in a form that you can easily add to—from your paycheck, for example. Ideally, the funds should earn a return, while also remaining stable enough in value that they'll be sufficient to meet the down payment when the time comes. Finding the balance of risk, reward, flexibility, and timing that works for you is the key consideration as you choose among the options below.
Savings Account
Storing your funds in a savings account at the bank where you do your checking is probably the simplest and easiest choice. As an existing customer, you can open a savings account quickly, and then readily transfer money to it from your checking account, either manually or through a series of recurring transfers on every payday.
The funds are highly secure, since they're guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or the National Credit Union Association (NCUA). The downside to this option is a meager return on your funds, since regular savings accounts come with very low interest rates.
High-Yield Savings Account
If you want to earn more interest without sacrificing the safety of FDIC or NCUA protection, opt for a high-yield savings account. As the term suggests, these pay far higher interest than a regular account, sometimes 10 to 20 times as much.
You can open such an account at your current bank, which will satisfy a condition that's sometimes imposed on high-yield accounts: that the customer already holds another account at the institution. However, the highest rates on these accounts are offered by online-only banks. If you can live with their absence of brick-and-mortar locations, one of these virtual institutions may be the best savings option of all.
That said, if you're not already an online banking customer you'll likely need to wait a little longer for transfers from your checking account than if you held the savings account at your own bank. And even the interest rates of online savings accounts are nothing to brag about compared with the potential earnings from other investment options.
Investment Account
If you have an appetite for higher risk, you can opt to have your down payment fund accumulate in an investment account at a major brokerage. The account will allow you to invest the money in stocks and mutual funds that will potentially earn far higher returns than even a high-yield savings account.
However, given the volatility of the stock market, you may not realize those healthy returns as quickly as you need. Investing a fund in stocks, then, is best reserved for those whose timeline to buy a home is flexible and can afford to wait out any fluctuations in the market. As a rule, the stock market generally recovers from downturns over time, and funds held in stocks achieve healthier earnings in the long run.
If you're are unsure of how to choose a broker or you can check out this list of the best online stock brokers.
The Bottom Line
If you want convenience above all else, you'll do perfectly well with a saving account at the brick-and-mortar bank you may already use. If you want a little more return, and don’t mind waiting on transfers between banks, you can look to an online bank and earn more interest. If you can take the risk, investment accounts offer the best returns, but also present the highest risk that the value of your down payment fund might drop in the short term at the point when you need the money.
Given that you'll likely save tens of thousands of dollars for a down payment, it's wise to carefully research where best to hold that money, and choose the option that aligns with your needs and priorities.Jim Waldman Challenges New House Speaker’s Appointment
A Broward Democratic House member is challenging the appointment of State Rep. Larry Cretul, R-Ocala, as the new House Speaker.
State Rep. Jim Waldman of Coconut Creek, who monitors the House rules for House Democrats, said Friday that Cretul must be elected, not appointed.
Waldman
“Any permanent successor must be elected, said Waldman, the Democrat’s Rules Liaison. “Those are the rules.
Waldman will bring his views to a meeting of the Democratic House caucus next week.
If the 44 House Democrats agree with Waldman, they would formally call for an election.
Whatever the Democrats do, they won’t elect one of their own as speaker. There are approximately two Republicans for every Democrat in the House.
So all the Democrats can really do is make noise and bad publicity for the GOP.
Speakers are normally elected by the 120 House members, and Cretul’s automatic elevation to the post is highly unusual.
It was triggererd by House Speaker Ray Sansom, who stepped down Friday amid a growing scandal. Sansom said in a statement that Cretul, who is the Speaker Pro Tem, would replace him.
Cretul was expected to fill the remainder of Sansom’s term.
Waldman said that unless Cretul serves only temporarily, the House rules mandate a new election. He believes that Cretul’s job is not temporary if he intends to serve through the whole session.
“The question is whether we will recognize Cretul as the speaker without an election, Waldman said.
If the Republicans call an election for speaker, it could trigger a free-for-all for leadership of the House just weeks before the 2009 March-April session is set to open.
There is no guarantee that Republican House members would elect Cretul speaker. State political blogs say other Republicans have already begun quietly jockeying for the powerful job.
January 30th, 2009 at 5:55 pm
Jim Waldman is trying to rehabilitate himself after trying to make the sheriff’s office non-partisan. That would have hurt the Democrats. Now he is trying to be a real Democrat. He has a long way to go
January 30th, 2009 at 7:24 pm
If Jim Waldman is concerned about rules, why doesn’t he actually live in his district?
January 30th, 2009 at 7:30 pm
Waldman is wrong. The house rules that he and the other democrats voted for say that: “The Speaker pro tempore shall exercise
the duties, powers, and prerogatives of the Speaker in the event of the Speaker’s
death, illness, removal, or inability to act, until the Speaker’s successor is
elected.”
Article III, Section 2 of the state constitution clearly says that the speakers successor is elected in the 2010 org session:
”As the use of SSL grows to the point where it’s the standard protocol, cybercriminals are increasingly using encryption to conceal and launch attacks. This has become possible because SSL certificates, which used to be difficult to obtain, are now readily available at no charge.
Zscaler released the 2019 Cloud Security Insights Threat Report – An Analysis of SSL/TLS-based threats, which examines encrypted traffic across the Zscaler cloud from July through December 2018. The report, compiled by the Zscaler ThreatLabZ research team, delves into a variety of attacks executed over SSL and blocked by Zscaler, including phishing attacks, botnets, browser exploitation, and malicious content.
,” said Amit Sinha, Executive Vice President of Engineering and Cloud Operations, Chief Technology Officer, Zscaler.
“With a high percentage of threats now delivered with SSL encryption, and over 80 percent of Internet traffic now encrypted, enterprises are blind to over half of malware sent to their employees. The Zscaler cloud platform enables “man-in-the-middle” SSL inspection at scale, so it can inspect SSL traffic without latency and capacity limitations and provide customers with protection against the growing number of threats attempting to hide behind encryption,” Sinha added.
During the study period, Zscaler blocked 1.7 billion threats hidden in SSL traffic, which translates to an average of 283 million advanced threats blocked per month.
Key research highlights
- Phishing: On average, the Zscaler cloud platform blocked 2.7 million phishing attacks over encrypted channels per month in 2018. This represents an increase of more than 400 percent when compared to SSL-based phishing attacks blocked in 2017.
- Malicious content: An average of 32 million botnet callback attempts were blocked by the Zscaler cloud platform every month in 2018.
- Browser exploitation: The Zscaler cloud platform blocked an average of 240,000 browser exploitation attempts per month in 2018.
- Newly registered domains: Nearly 32 percent of newly registered domains that were blocked by the Zscaler cloud platform were using SSL encryption.
“One of the most notable SSL threat trends that we saw in 2018 was the increase in JavaScript skimmer-based attacks. These attacks start with the e-commerce sites being compromised and injected with malicious, obfuscated JavaScript, which, in turn, tries to tap into purchase transactions,” said Deepen Desai, Vice President of Security Research, Zscaler. “With the increase in JavaScript skimmer-based attacks, criminals can conduct their nefarious activity within the confines of the SSL environment, leaving most e-commerce sites unaware of the activity.”Spain's new Socialist government announced Wednesday a female-dominated Cabinet, including women appointed to key positions overseeing the national economy, finance and defense.
The new government includes 11 female ministers and five men, as well as Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez who said it is the first time since Spain returned to a democratic system in the late 1970s that there are more women than men in the Cabinet.
Nadia Calvino, who has been director general for the budget at the European Union's Commission since 2014, was appointed as the minister in charge of the eurozone's fourth largest economy.
Margarita Robles was named defense minister, and Maria Jesus Montero will be finance minister. The posts of justice minister and education minister also went to women.
Sanchez informed King Felipe VI of the appointments before announcing them. The new ministers are to take office on Thursday.
Sanchez said in a statement his administration will be "progressive, modernizing and Europe-minded."

Now the Orange Is The New Black star has released the music video, also during Black History Month and in preparation for Women's History Month, to celebrate the complexities of being a Black woman in America. We get to experience Danielle's velvety smooth voice and beautiful brown skin in the striking visual.
Submerged in a bathtub of water while dressed in a stunning gold gown, Danielle, whose makeup and bronzer is flawless by the way, emotionally sings, "You want my thighs, you my stride / But not this melanin / You want my hair / But you don't care for this complexion / I'm a black woman." At one point in the video, the songstress stops singing the empowering anthem as tears stream down her face. All she can do is cry, shedding the pain she feels from the burden of constantly defending her being.
A proponent of body positivity, Ms. Brooks isn't new to this, she's true to this. Remember EBONY's 2016 "Women Up!" cover featuring 'The Body Brigade?" We can't wait to see what positive messages Danielle has in store for us next. In the meantime, celebrate womanhood and melanin when you watch Danielle Brooks' new video for "Black Woman."politics
Jewish Labour MP Luciana Berger faces no-confidence motion
Luciana Berger faces a no-confidence motion from her local Labour Party for criticising Jeremy Corbyn’s handling of the party’s antisemitism crisis.
The Jewish Chronicle reported that Ms Berger, a prominent Jewish MP, was facing the censure motion in her Liverpool Wavertree constituency on February 17. The motion accuses her of “continually using the media to criticise the man we all want to be prime minister”.
Ms Berger has been an outspoken critic of the party’s failure to deal with antisemitism in its ranks and has said that the party’s “disgusting” antisemitism was “going unchecked”.
This morning John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said that he believed the motion was related to reports she was considering backing a party split. “Just tell people you’re not supporting a…Puneri Paltan vs UP Yoddha Match Preview, Team News, Lineups
Pro Kabaddi League 2018 | Puneri Paltan vs UP Yoddha
As the interzonal challenge week continues, UP Yoddha’s will be up against the home favorites Puneri Paltan for the 32nd match of the competition.
The current standings suggest Puneri Paltans are leading the Zone A chart despite a disheartening pummel in their last encounter to Tamil Thalaivas by 36-32 whereas, UP Yoddha who last played a 40-40 draw against Bengal Warriors are holding the fifth spot in Zone B.
Puneri Paltan are in a really good touch this season with their offense and defense both clicking at the same time. In defence, Girish Maruti Ernak the skipper is leading from the front with the Orange arm-band in his possession while his team-mate Nitin Tomar has the Green arm-band to his name.
UP Yoddha’s meanwhile, haven’t dealt with their defence as Nitesh Kumar is the lone warrior from the left corner and is not getting any support from his fellow raiders. UP has to come up with a strong defence in this match as they have to prevent Nitin Tomar from claiming rad points who has been unstoppable so far.
Let us delve into the PUN vs UP Dream11 predicted seven, team news, and squads;
When: October 24, 09:00 PM, IST
Where: Shree Shiv Chhatrapati Sports Complex, Pune
Puneri Paltan: LWWWL
UP Yoddha: WLLDL
Puneri Paltan: Stay Tuned
UP Yoddha: Stay Tuned

Puneri Paltan: Nitin Tomar, GB More/Akshay Jadhav, Girish Maruti, Ravi Kumar, Monu, Shubham Shinde, Rinku Narwal.
Defenders: Here, Girish Maruti Ernak the skipper of Puneri Paltan who has the most tackle points to his name for Pune will be a preferred choice. Nitesh Kumar is the top defender for UP so far so he is a fruitful choice as well.
Among the others, you can go for Ravi Kumar who got 5 tackle points in the game against UMumba, Shubham Shinde is also a good choice with fewer credit points.
All-rounders: Sagar Krishna has been robust in the all-round department for UP. Meanwhile, Monu has been on song in the last two or three games with a total of 19 points from 4 games which include 14 raid points.
Raiders: The green arm-band holder Nitin Tomar with most raid points of the season currently should be a definite inclusion in your fantasy team. The duo of Prashant Kumar Rai and Shrikant Jadhav who have got a total of 77 points between them in 9 matches.
Other reliable picks here would be, Rishank Devadiga and GB More who got a super 10 in the last game.

“No panel company has achieved this level of excellence,” say auditors. “SSI has clearly demonstrated an ability to be consistent in more markets than any other company.”
SHELTON, CT, October 10, 2012—SSI’s Online Sample Blend in Canada, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United Stateshas been awarded highest honors for exceptional consistency by auditors from Sample Source Auditors™, a division of Mktg. Inc.
After five years of testing more than 300 panels in 35 countries as part of Mktg. Inc.’s Grand Mean Project™, only 11 panels have demonstrated consistency through the Mktg. Inc. Consistent Track™ audit.
But after the latest round of testing of SSI’s Online Sample Blend, the auditors reveal that “SSI has now achieved consistency in almost as many countries as has the rest of the world…No panel company has achieved this level of excellence…SSI has clearly demonstrated an ability to be consistent in more markets than any other company.”
Sample consistency is critical to quality research. Researchers need to know that changes in their data are real and not due to shifts in the underlying sample frame.
Above:Example of Consistency of SSI Sample Blend, The Netherlands
The sample which demonstrated this extraordinary level of consistency is SSI’s proprietary Online Sample Blend, which encompasses SSI’s own managed panels blended with online community members, social media participants, and respondents from across the web.
Bob Fawson, SSI’s Chief Access, Supply and Engagement Officer, comments: “SSI’s Online Sample Blend is balanced on people, not sources, using personality, psychographic, and social value factors. We believe it is this unique approach which makes it so powerful. Getting this external validation of its unmatched consistency is hugely gratifying.”
Above: Quality and Consistency of SSI Sample Blend, US
The Audit also measured quality of response, examining measures like straightlining and other measures of respondent quality. SSI’s Online Sample Blend also performed superbly on these measures when compared to the hundreds of other sources tested. It clearlyoutperforms the Grand Mean (the average of other sources tested), as the example from the US demonstrates..Gastroenterologist

Not content with overtaking Apple and Nokia as the world’s largest smartphone and cell phone vendor, respectively, Samsung during the June quarter managed to widen its lead by selling twice as much smartphones as Apple.
Driven by the surprisingly strong start of its latest flagship handset, the Galaxy S III, Samsung has managed to increase its worldwide smartphone share while Apple slid. Man, Apple really needs to refresh the iPhone twice a year because this annual update cycle is becoming the company’s Achilles’ heel…
Apple reported sales of 26 million iPhones during the June quarter, missing estimates by three million units as more and more people hold off upgrading until the next iPhone arrives in September or October.
Samsung stopped divulging smartphone and tablet numbers last summer for competitive reasons so we have to rely on estimates. Also, Samsung’s numbers are shipments while Apple’s numbers are sell through.
According to research firm IDC, Apple’s worldwide smartphone share slid from 18.8 percent in the year-ago quarter to 16.9 percent in Q2 2012. Though the iPhone grew 27.5 percent year-over-year, global smartphone shipments surged at a faster 42 percent clip.
During the same period, Samsung nearly doubled its global smartphone share, having surged from 17 percent to a whopping 32.6 percent based on estimated sales of 50.2 million smartphones, up 172.8 percent year-over-year.
An estimated Galaxy S III sales this quarter were 6.8 million units.
Here’s your table, courtesy of IDC.
IDC explains Samsung’s ‘shotgun’ strategy:.
If you need another proof that Samsung is eating into iPhone sales, here it is.
IDC’s numbers mirror figures from Juniper Research, which noted that Apple needs to make a bigger iPhone and create something new of Siri’s magnitude to compete successfully with huge Samsung handsets like the S III.
[tube]yZwdwEdkHL0[/tube]
Another interesting thing happened as well.
Samsung reported Q2 operating profit of $5.9 billion and $4.6 billion in net profit, or half of Apple’s $8.8 billion Q2 net profit which includes Macs, iPhones, iPods, iPads and other products.
Put together, Apple and Samsung together account for more than half of smartphone sales globally and as much as 80 percent of cell phone industry’s profits.
Considering as much as 60 percent of Samsung’s profits come from smartphones and smartphone-related components, Samsung is pretty much a Galaxy company.
Likewise, Apple is now an iPhone company as nearly 60 percent of its profits now come from the iPhone and related products and services.
You may find it unsettling that Samsung has rapidly overtaken both Apple and Nokia to become the world’s largest smartphone maker.
It appears Apple’s annual refresh cycle has finally come to bite the company in the you-know-what. iPhone shipment volume is traditionally highest in the first two quarters after its release, but this time Apple saw a quarter-over-quarter decline just six months after its latest iPhone unveiling.
Furthermore, Samsung gets to report one more quarter of monster sales as the next iPhone won’t land before fall. If Samsung manages to sell 15 million S III phones during the current quarter, as projected, that’s an additional $7 billion in sales increase.
Perhaps Apple needs to step up its game by having two iPhone hardware refreshes a year, one for a major model introduction, followed by a minor hardware and/or cosmetic bump up six months later.
In other words, compress the iPhone 5/5S unveilings in one year instead of two?Unleash your super power

George Bezanis is raising money to hire a plane to fly a protest banner and circle the skies during the upcoming festivities.
For months, Philadelphia leaders have been touting the economic windfall the upcoming NFL draft is expected to bring to the city.
But public school teachers, who have been waiting for a new contract for five years, say they aren’t expecting any of that to trickle down to them. The negotiations haven't gotten a great deal of public attention, but that may soon change.
George Bezanis, a social studies teacher at Central High School and teachers' union representative, wants to make the contract dispute visible to everyone who will descend upon the city for the draft.
Bezanis has started a crowdfunding page with the goal of hiring a plane to fly a protest banner over the Benjamin Franklin Parkway, where the three-day extravaganza is taking place from April 27-29.
On the crowdfunding page, Bezanis noted the massive banner on City Hall that is promoting the draft event. That banner reads: "The Future is Now."
In response, he wrote, “Where's the banner in support of teachers?" He added, “Why don't we fly a plane over the NFL draft and show them our banner!"
Bezanis had already raised $1,085 as of Tuesday evening from 51 supporters. He is trying to raise $2,000, enough so the aerial messaging can circle the sky for several hours from the Art Museum to City Hall.
“If the Philadelphia Federation of Teachers still doesn't have a contract by April 27, we need to remind our city's elected officials and the leaders of the district what they should really be passionate about – our schools,” Bezanis wrote on his crowd-funding page.
Bezanis is also polling supporters to see what message they think the banner should read. Options featuring puns on the nature of the draft include, “Let’s draft a contract for Philly teachers,” and, “Philly teachers should always be #1 pick.”
This isn’t the first time Bezanis, a Philadelphia Federation of Teachers (PFT) representative and Caucus of Working Educators leader, has taken part in large-scale messaging in the name of a new contract. In February, he helped set up a billboard over Interstate 95 that read: “Welcome to Philadelphia, where we don’t value our public school children.”
The billboard was funded by more than $5,000 through a similar crowd-funding campaign.
Public school teachers have gone some 1,200 days without a raise. Their pay-scale was frozen pending a new contract, according to PFT president Jerry T. Jordan.Gabriel 35cm Concrete & Wood Silent Wall Clock

The popular management theories used at the work are chaos theory, contingency theory, and system theory. Theory X and Y that addresses management strategies for motivating the employees is also implemented to increase the productivity of the worker.
Understanding the management theories is the only way to find out which theory is suitable and beneficial in accordance to the circumstance at your workplace. Find out whether a single theory in itself is enough to handle the situation or combination of theories would help well. However, this could be done only if you studied and are aware of the management theories completely.
Important Management theories
There are several management theories for the purpose of the managerial activity at the office. However the most commonly used theories to manage the work and the functioning by the managers are as follows:
Contingency Theory
This theory emphasizes that the decisions made by the manager are based on the present circumstances rather than following the method one size fits all. An appropriate action is taken by the manager depending on the features significant to the present situation. A leader in the army would want to utilize an autocratic approach while the manager in the university would want to use a leadership approach that embraces participation from employees.
Systems Theory
Managers with a good understanding of systems theory identify how an employee affects the system around them and how different systems influence a worker. A system comprises of variants of parts that function together to achieve the objective. The theory of system is a broad viewpoint that enables managers to observe the events and patterns in the office space. Which in turn helps the managers to match up programs to perform as a combined whole for the complete mission or goal of the business rather than the isolated departments.
Chaos Theory
Change is Necessary and perpetual. Specific situations and events in the company can be effectively controlled while some cannot. With respect to the chaos theory, it is identified that change is unavoidable and is rarely controlled. As the company advances, intricacy and possibility for susceptible events increase. Companies increase energy to maintain the complexity of new level. As the companies spend more energy, more structure is required for maintaining the stability. The organization continues to develop and change.
Theory X and Theory Y
The management theory an individual choose to apply is strongly subjective to the beliefs about the attitudes of the employee. Managers who believe Employees lack ambition naturally and need incentives to upsurge the productivity lean towards the style of X management theory. While believes of Theory Y is that the employees are naturally determined and take responsibility. The managers who tend to follow the Theory X values often use a controlling style of leadership, Theory Y leaders inspire participation from the employees.
Management theory in the workplace for Motivation
Amongst several business theories that are in existence in the corporate governance, one motivational theory that can be applied by the management in most of the circumstances is the Equity Theory on job inspiration, which deals that conditions and pay are not adequate to motivate the staff.
Recommended courses
Equity Theory
Nothing like the basic motivation that involves of offering a reward such as pay for the action. The Equity Theory looks further than just the individual and comprises of factors in the individual’s setting that may have impacted motivation through comparison. The theory indicates clearly that when an individual compares himself to his colleague and discovers a fair result, he will be more motivated. While on the other hand he compares and finds the result to be unfair or unequal in comparison to his colleague he will tend to be less motivated. The principle of Equity Theory lies in the sense of motivation through seeming fairness.
How the Equity Theory Works
When one individual compares his or her ratio of input and output to the ratios of input and output of the workers around them, the individual is supporting the Theory of Equity. The comparison of input and output ratios turns to be a point of reference for the motivation of the person and whether that motivation will decrease or continue. Hence, the Equity theory operates in two ways. The first involves the person assessing the ratio of input and output. The second comprises of the person assessing the ratios of inputs and outputs of the coworkers. Commitment, loyalty, and skill are part of the Input while praise, financial reward and increase in the responsibility are part of the output.
Importance of Equity theory
The Equity theory is an imperative business tool to evaluate the satisfaction of the employee, the relationship between productivity and motivation and how to increase motivation to reach and enhance the objectives and goals of the company. For Example, a hardworking worker might believe that a fair salary is paid to him until he comes to known the fact that he is one of the lowest paid employees in the staff. This knowledge might lead him to become uninspired which in turn could be a threat to the company’s success.
Basic Management Theories
There are basic management theories and models that are associated with leadership and motivation that can be applied to overcome the problems and practical situation.
The section covers:
- Human Relations Theory
- Classical Management theory
- System Theory
- Neo-Human Relations Theory
Human Relation Theories
The theory of human relation are reasonably concerned with human factors. The Human relation theory focuses on inspiration, leadership, and group motivation. At the focal point of the efforts are assumptions about the relationship between the manager and the worker.
- The emphasis was on the behavior of the human within the organization.
- It is stated that people require decisive factors in achieving effectiveness in the organization.
- As per the theory, the employees are descriptive and endeavored to be predictive of behavior in the company.
- A motive is a driving force or a need within a person. The procedure of motivation includes selecting between alternative forms of action to achieve the desired goals or end.
Classical Management Theory
Management occurs within a structured administrative setting with recommended roles. It is directed towards achieving the objectives and goals by influencing the efforts of others.
The Classical Management Theory
- Marks on structure
- Strict about what is upright for the firm.
- Manage practically
Henry Fayol was the first person to define the management that is namely familiar in the present as to command, to organize, forecast and plan, to control and to coordinate. The basic concepts and terminology were also given by Fayol that elaborated by the future researchers as a scalar chain, a division of labor, centralization and unity of command.
Key terms of Classical management theory
- Division of work: Develops practice and familiarity among the staff. Plus it reduces the effort or attention for one person or one group.
- Discipline: A noticeable mark of respect for the informal or formal agreements between the employees and the firm.
- Unity of Command: One man superior
- Initiative: In the limits of discipline and authority all levels of staff should be motivated to show initiative.
- Unity of direction: One superior with one plan for a group of tasks that has similar objectives.
- Order: A right person at the right place. Working carried out in an appropriate order.
System Theories
The attention on the organization began to focus on systems with a number of interrelated sub-systems. The system method made an effort to synthesize with the classical approaches and later with human relations approaches that focus on the social and psychological aspects that highlight the needs of a human at people without organization.
The theory of systems is focused on the interdependence and complexity of relationships. The System is formed by regular interdependent or interacting groups of activities or parts that form the emergent whole.
System dynamics which is part of the systems theory is a technique of understanding the active behavior of complex systems. The basis of the method is the acknowledgment of the structure of the system- the interlocking, many circular, occasional time-delayed relationships among its components is imperative in determining the behavior of individual components themselves.
The aim of the system theorists was to find the general systems theory that can explain all systems part of the science field. The term goes back to the General Systems Theory. Many sociologists worked for a general systems theory. In the present, no systems theory can live up to the claim that there are general principles in the systems which are present in all systems. For example, every system is a collaboration of elements establishing as a whole.
The theory of Systems took more of a complete view of the company focusing on the organization’s entire work and the inter-relationships between human and structural behaviors producing a wide range of variables within the company. It helps us to understand the interactions between the organizations, groups, individuals, large social systems, communities and their environments. It aids us to enhance the understanding of how human behavior functions in a situation.
A system is a whole as well as a part at the same time. For example: A range of discipline along with professional from the various sector with authority is also required.
Key terms of System Theory
- Boundary: An imaginary line focusing around the system. It regulates the energy ie: resources, information into and out of the system.
- Subsystem: A part of the focal system. Eg: In a family it could be a parent or the children. It is referred as a parental subsystem or sibling subsystem.
- Focal System: The system on which the focus is upon at any given time. E.g.: the main manufacturing plant.
- Open system: Open system have a relatively freer exchange of information and resources within the system. It also enables relatively free passage of energy from and to the outside of the system.
- Suprasystem: It is an external part of the focal system, it is part of the environment of the focal system.
- Closed system: This system are more self-contained and isolated from their surroundings.
Neo Human Relation Theory
The group were social psychologists develop more complex theories:
- Maslow
- Likert
- McGregor
- Argyris
Maslow is quoted as a seminal theory- the needs of the human beings. While McGregor and Herzberg neo-human relations theories focus on leadership and motivation but the theories are very dissimilar.
A particular focus on human motivation include:
- Incentive
- Satisfaction
- Intrinsic
Maslow: Proposed a hierarchy of human needs built with basic needs at the base and higher needs at the top.
An assumption is made in the theory that needs at each level needs to be satisfied before elevating the needs to the next higher level.
In the present, the focus is on the elements towards the top of the hierarchy of Maslow in which the work environment and work or the satisfaction are the typical features. Remarkably the attainment of confidence at the top of hierarchy.
According to the theory, Managers should consider the aspirations and needs of individual subordinates.
Likert: Theory describing new patterns of management based on the managers’ behavior.
McGregor: The Theory X and Theory Y through which the managers were perceived. The theory is quoted to make two remarkable set of assumptions about the employees.
Argyris: The needs of the company and people are studied under this theory. The workforce becomes cooperative instead of aggressive or defensive only if the needs of the employees are understood and are integrated with the needs of the organization.
Applying the management theories will not only bring success to the company but will maintain the bond with the employees associated with the organization. Hence, Study and know the management theories to imply it sensibly.

New images from Rocketman feature Taron Egerton’s radical transformation into Elton John. The biopic about John is scheduled to hit theaters on May 31st and the promotional campaign is starting to roll again after the first teaser for the movie was released back in October. Hopefully, this means that a full trailer is on its way, now that Bohemian Rhapsody is preparing to hit Blu-ray and digital services. We’ve all heard of Freddy vs. Jason, but it looks like a new battle is coming later this year with Freddie vs. Elton.
One of the new images from Rocketman shows Taron Egerton as Elton John during his now-legendary 1975 performance at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles. Egerton can be seen wearing a sparkly Dodgers uniform, just like the one that John wore during the performance, a look that has been copied too many times to count since then. John was able to sell out two nights in a row, performing to over 100,000 people in what became his career-defining performances, playing for over 3 hours and setting the bar extremely high for all that followed.
The next shot from Rocketman features a young version of Taron Egerton’s Elton John sitting at a piano, singing into a microphone in a recording studio. This is a few steps back from the triumphant Dodger Stadium gigs, but shows how he got there. Before the stadiums, John was delivering number one records and hit singles, building into one of the biggest popstars in history. It’s going to be very interesting to see how they are able to pull off the ups and downs of Elton John’s personal and professional life on the big screen, especially since the musician is still alive to give notes on the project.
Related: Rocketman Photo with Tom Hardy and Elton John
The final image from the latest Rocketman images shows off Taron Egerton in full late 1970s Elton John rock star mode. A custom white leather jacket, sparky glasses and a shirt with a plunging neckline. John was on top of the world at this point and the drugs and groupies were flowing, which one can almost see on Egerton’s face. The only complaint here is that the star clearly has less chest hair than Elton John did at this particular time in his career, and slightly more hair on his head.
With the massive success of Bohemian Rhapsody, Rocketman is going to have some added pressure when it hits theaters later this year. Rami Malek’s portrayal of Freddie Mercury has been widely praised, which helped the movie become the highest grossing music biopic of all time. As of this writing, the biopic has made over $714.4 million, which is something that has shocked everybody involved in the project, including Queen guitarist Brian May. However, Rocketman will put the focus on one artist, as opposed to the band dynamic, and will hopefully benefit from having access to the source, since Elton John is still alive. You can check out the Rocketman images below, thanks to the Rocketman Twitter account.

Writing alongside an image of the offending bag, he pondered aloud: “Imagine they were handing out red, white & blue bags?”

Bryson was so irked by the entire “Bag-gate” saga, as he went on the term it, that he even went on to write an entire opinion piece on the matter.
He lambasted JD’s bag design, claiming it "neatly undermines nationalism’s own more extreme grievance narratives".
Unfortunately, his fellow Twitter users were having none of it.
Most, in fact, were quick to point out that one rather large retailer already hands out red, white and blue bags.

As the saying goes: “fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me.”Utagawa Yoshitsuya (1822-1866) Takechi Umanosuke Attacking the Castle from Fifty-four Battle Stories of Hideyoshi, 1864. Oban.
We are showing three classic warrior prints from Yoshitsuya’s finest series: Fifty-four Battle Stories of Hideyoshi. Hagiography is an art common to all cultures - this combination of historical fact, mythology and fiction, designed to elevate the subject and set him (usually) above his contemporaries. In Japan, few other figures than Hideyoshi (1536 - 1598) could be more praised or mythologized. Hideyoshi is the hero general above all others: a 'peasant samurai' he rose through the ranks of Oda Nobunaga's army, eventually to usurp him and finally to unify Japan, establish its feudal system, (isolating the samurai class) and lay the foundations for the Tokugawa administration that followed. He was fiercely ambitious in his foreign campaigns toward China and Korea - which were eventually to be his downfall and a shadow on his legacy. He was also, cunning, horrifyingly brutal and obsessive. An addendum to his legacy is his appearance in a contemporary anime series as a cartoon hero.
The relaxation (after 1864) of rules banning the direct depiction of historical characters allowed this series to be made. Yoshitsuya takes passages from two old hagiographies as the subject matter, depicting true and fanciful stories of victories and battles. The series is lavishly printed - complex and detailed with many colours and blocks, beautifully carved and imagined, each print is framed with a decorative border. The series is often hard to come by, some prints being particularly rare.
(Koko) Yoshitsuya was a pupil of Kuniyoshi’s; he specialised in Japanese history prints and this is one of his finest and most ambitious projects. His work is known for its historical detail. He died young, two years after this series was published.
In this print Yoshitsuya shows a massive arquebus or cannon, lashed to the roof of a building. One of Hideyoshi’s generals, Umanosuke, directs the attack, the print blooming with subtle overprinting to evoke the blast and after-effect of the firing. The decorative border that appears on each print features the distinctive gourds of Hideyoshi's "thousand gourd" standard, a device used as a signature by Kuniyoshi and many of his pupils. The print is in fine condition, full size with original printed borders - colour and impression are also fine.

Toshidama Gallery - Church House - Church Street - Upton Noble - Somerset - BA4 6ASMagnesium is the eleventh most abundant element by mass in the human body, and the fourth most abundant mineral. In fact, researchers estimate that the average human body contains about 25 grams of magnesium, of which over 60 percent is found in the skeleton. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines, and excreted through the kidneys.
Regulates enzyme reactions – Like most other macro-minerals (minerals that our bodies need in great amounts; the opposite of trace minerals), magnesium’s main roles are regulatory in nature. It allows enzymes to function correctly and efficiently, thereby regulating a massive number of important chemical reactions. A small number of these reactions include producing proteins and antioxidants (including the body’s most powerful antioxidant, glutathione, which keeps all other antioxidants performing at peak levels), the creation of RDN and DNA, and the regulation of cholesterol breakdown. While magnesium does not induce all of these reactions by itself, it does play extremely important roles in them. Without magnesium, our bodies would literally spiral out of control..Toe Walking and Feeding Difficulties Resolved Following Chiropractic

via @theGoodQuote
Since sharing my early morning routine with you, I’ve heard from so many of you who either: 1) wake up early too and can relate to the sound of the alarm clock going off while it’s still dark outside, or 2) want to wake up earlier, but need a plan to start.
Today’s post is for you! If you are in category 3) “I’m sleeping until the last possible minute and then pushing snooze too many times”, I totally get it! You might want to skip today’s post- except for the part where I review our new Serta iComfort TempTouch mattress with cooling technology. You don’t want to miss that! 😉
1. DETERMINE WHY YOU WANT TO GET UP EARLY
When the alarm goes off way before you’re ready for it to, you will probably start having a conversation in your head that goes something like this. “I’m so tired. I’m not ready to wake up. Maybe I can sleep five more minutes. Or ten. It’s so cozy in this bed. I’ll workout/meditate/read/pray later in the day. Tomorrow I’ll wake up early. I’m going back to sleep.”
You can’t listen to those voices! You have to listen to the wiser part of you that made the decision the night before and immediately think of your reason WHY you want to wake up early. For me, I want to workout. But, digging deeper, I want to workout so I can be healthy, feel better in my body, be strong, have energy, not have to take time out of the rest of my day to workout, and start the day feeling ahead of the game instead of behind.
If you have this information immediately available when the rest of you is trying to persuade you to sleep in, it’ll be much easier to actually get out of bed. Listen to your smarter self, not the saboteur!

2. GO TO BED EARLY
In the first days when you are trying to wake up early, your body probably won’t be ready to go to sleep as early as it needs to, so just know those first days are going to be rough!
When I set my wake up early goal in May, it was to wake up at 5am. I like a good 7-8 hours of sleep per night, so that means I need to be asleep by 9 pm. Well, when you aren’t used to going to bed until 11pm, you won’t suddenly be ready to go to sleep two hours earlier – at first.
But, after a few days of waking up at your appointed early hour, you will be so tired that you’ll be ready to go to bed earlier. And you need to! If you don’t get to bed, you will be miserable the next day and probably grouchy. When mama ain’t happy, ain’t nobody happy!
I find it helps get me into bed early if I have something I want to read. That way, I’m off electronics (goodnight Instagram and Pinterest) and TV (save OITNB and House of Cards for the weekends because it’s too tempting to binge late night). I do read on my kindle, but I’m pretty good about shutting it down when I feel sleepy enough to fall asleep. Or you could meditate with the headspace app and that may help lull you to sleep.
3. GET A GOOD NIGHT SLEEP
The next key to waking up early is getting a good, restful night’s sleep. If you make it to bed early, but don’t actually get good sleep, you won’t feel good the next day. I’ve taken to wearing earplugs if I need to drown out the sound of someone’s snoring (they work!) and we found a solution to getting too hot in the bed too.
We recently upgraded our mattress to a Serta iComfort TempTouch Memory Foam bed, exclusively sold at MattressFirm and we love it! The cool;) thing about it is that it has TempActive technology that helps keep you cool at night because it dissipates heat away from you as you sleep. As soon as we lay down on it the first night, you could feel to the touch how much cooler it was. Even James wanted to test it out that night, so we let him sleep with us. Everyone agreed it was awesome!
Not only does this mattress keep you cooler, it’s super comfortable. Buying a mattress is one of those things that is hard because a quick test at the store might not tell the story for how you’ll actually sleep on it for several hours at night. But, from the first night, we loved the comfort of this bed with deep reaction memory foam. After sleeping on it for a month now, I can say it’s my favorite mattress I’ve owned.
4. GET RIGHT UP
As soon as your alarm goes off, get right up! Do not hit snooze, do not push pause, do not pass go! All of those things are just little sneaky tactics your inner sleep persuader will use to get you to forget your goals. If you get out of bed, the chances are slim that you’ll get back in bed. But if you don’t get up right away, chances are high that you’ll fall back asleep and miss your early wake up time. So, get up, covers off, feet on the floor!
One thing that has helped me get right up is using Hue lightbulbs in our lamps. They work with an app on your phone, so I can set them to turn on bright white simultaneously when my alarm goes off. That’ll wake you up!
5. GET TO KNOW THE FEELING OF ACCOMPLISHMENT
What I mean by this is accomplish whatever it is you set out to accomplish by waking up early. Feel how good it feels to be productive in that way. This feeling of accomplishment builds momentum and success breeds success.
When my alarm goes off at 5:00 or 5:30 am and I get up and go workout, come back home, get showered and dressed all before my kids wake up, it feels amazing! Now I have that experience to keep me going the next day. On the days I don’t get up early and workout, I don’t feel as energized throughout the day.
Even though it’s hard in the moment to wake up early, it’s better for the rest of the hours of the day. The short term “pain” is worth the long term gain!
So are a ‘wake up early’ or ‘sleep-in’ kind of girl?!

I need to use some of these tips! My biggest problem is hitting the snooze button 🙂 I’m trying to wake up a little earlier each day! Love the idea of acknowledging what you’re accomplishing that early in the morning. Going to try this week!
I don’t mind getting up early, it’s the going to bed early that I need to work on 😉 Now that #2 is living back home and has to get up early for work, I get up with her (and help with her sweet puppy if needed). But hubby is not a fan of getting up that early (does but not happily LOL). Does Jimmy get up at the same time as you? Do the lights coming on bother him if he doesn’t? Gotta find a happy medium.

The dA development system has a setting so that when a sleep flag is enabled (eg, when a developer is testing/fixing code and doesn't want it to go live yet), no other developers can push code to the live site. This badge is given to developers who do not disable the flag before they go to sleep at night (and thus no new code can be tested/fixed that night).cyanosis

Drivers who are convicted of driving under the influence where there was a collision that caused damages or injuries to another are typically ordered to pay restitution to any and all victims as a condition of probation. In many cases, a defendant’s insurer may cover the restitution award. However, there may be cases where insurance does not cover the damages or the victim is claiming damages that exceed the defendant’s policy limits. In these cases, the defendant will be required to pay victim restitution out of pocket. The restitution award may be very large and the defendant may not be able to pay the full amount during the period of probation. In these cases, the judge can order that the remaining amount owed be converted to a civil judgement against the defendant.
At the time of sentencing, the judge will typically order that the defendant pay restitution to the victim in an amount to be determined. The defendant will often stipulate to liability but not to the amount owed. The victim is entitled to recover all damages incurred as a result of the defendant’s criminal conduct. If the defendant disagrees with the amount claimed, he or she can request a restitution hearing in which the victim has the burden of proving that the defendant’s conduct substantially caused the victim’s damages. At the conclusion of the hearing, the judge will determine how much, if anything, the defendant owes. The restitution award may be extremely high, especially where the victim sustained injuries and received extensive medical treatment.
The defendant would be expected to pay restitution as a condition of probation. If the defendant is not able to pay the full restitution amount at once, the judge may order an ability to pay hearing. At this hearing the defendant can present evidence regarding his or her financial situation, including income and expenses. The judge will ultimately place the defendant on a reasonable payment plan.
In many cases, the defendant is unable to fully pay the restitution amount during the period of probation. The judge may extend probation to give the defendant additional time to pay restitution. A defendant’s probation can be violated if he or she fails to pay restitution, however the failure to pay must be willful and intentional. If the defendant simply cannot afford to pay restitution, this would not be ground to violate probation.
If the defendant has still not fully paid restitution at the conclusion of the probation period, the judge can order that the remaining amount owed be converted to a civil judgement. Once a victim has a civil judgement, he or she has the power to garnish the defendant’s wages, can access the defendant’s financial records and can place a lien on any property owned by the defendant. The judgement would be in place until it is fully paid off by the defendant.
As long as there is a civil judgement, the defendant would be unable to expunge the underlying DUI conviction pursuant to California Penal Code Section 1203.4 PC. In addition, civil judgement for damages stemming from DUI incidents cannot be discharged in bankruptcy under United Stated Federal law.
If you have been involved in a DUI case where there may be a restitution issue, it is critical that you discuss your case with a Los Angeles DUI Attorney as soon as possible. As a former Deputy District Attorney with over 14 years of prosecutorial experience, Los Angeles DUI Attorney Michael Kraut works hard to ensure that his clients receive the most thorough representation at all stages of a DUI case, including the restitution hearing if necessary.

Unfortunately for many in this generation, retirement may not be all it’s cracked up to be. In fact, for far too many boomers, retirement is likely to be fraught with financial worries.
Why is the outlook so grim for some boomers? The Stanford Center on Longevity’s recent report on retirement preparedness points to three big reasons listed below. The good news, though, is that there are steps they can take to salvage the retirement security they deserve.
Image source: Getty Images.
1. Baby boomers have less total wealth than older retirees
According to the Stanford center, boomers in 2014 were behind on nearly every metric of household wealth.
Mid-boomers had less total household wealth than retirees a decade older. They also had less home equity. And among those age 55 to 60, their total household savings were well below what prior generations had saved by those same ages.
2. Boomers have less in retirement funds
It’s not just total savings where boomers fall short, either. They also have much less money in retirement savings plans, like 401(k)s or IRAs.
Stanford found a typical 50-year-old boomer had a smaller balance in retirement accounts compared with what prior generations had saved by 50. Even more troubling, approximately 30% of baby boomers had nothing saved in their retirement plans in 2014.
3. Boomers have much higher debt levels
While boomers are behind in savings and household wealth, they’re far exceeding elder counterparts on debt. Around two-thirds of baby boomers were indebted in 2014, compared with 20% of people in the prior generation and 40% of those born before 1940.
Boomers were not only more likely to have debt, but the levels they have are higher. Among boomers with debt, mid-boomers had average outstanding balances of $120,000. And those from 55 to 60 had higher debt-to-income ratios versus the prior generation at the same age range.
Are boomers doomed?
Less savings, higher debt, and less wealth are enough reasons for boomers to be concerned. But they also have to contend with the fact they’re likely to live longer, and so they’ll need their wealth to last longer than generations before.
But this doesn’t mean boomers need to give up on a happy retirement. There’s still time to make lifestyle changes — especially for younger boomers who haven’t left the workforce yet.
Options include:
- Taking advantage of catch-up contributions: As you get closer to retirement, you should take advantage of the option to contribute substantial sums to tax-advantage accounts. For 2019, you can contribute up to $19,000 to a 401(k) with pre-tax dollars. If you’re over 50, you can make additional catch-up contributions of $6,000. Depending on your income and access to a workplace retirement plan, you can also make tax-deductible contributions of up to $6,000 to an IRA, and additional catch-up contributions of $1,000 if you’re over 50. Max out these accounts if you’re behind on savings.
- Working longer or phasing-in retirement: Many boomers hope to remain healthy and active long past traditional retirement age. Consider leaving the workforce later and doing it in stages. You may be able to go part time or consult for a few years before officially quitting for good. While you’re still working, add as much as you can to your nest egg.
- Delaying Social Security: If you can wait until after full retirement age, you can earn delayed retirement credits that boost this source of guaranteed lifetime income.
- Making a debt payoff plan: If you can manage to become debt-free before retirement, you’ll be in much better shape. Try the debt snowball or debt avalanche methods to pay off your debt as soon as you can.
- Downsizing: Consider moving to a smaller home to eliminate or reduce your mortgage. A smaller home should also have lower property taxes and reduced maintenance costs.
- Moving to a lower cost-of-living area: You can move to a more tax-friendly state, to a place where the cost of living is lower, and perhaps to a walkable area so you can eliminate one or both cars in your household.
Being behind on savings or having a lower net worth than the prior generation doesn’t mean your retirement has to suffer — it just may look a little different than you expect.
Boomers should act today to boost their retirement security
Stanford’s report makes clear that many boomers are in a worse position today because of the housing market crash and resulting global recession in 2008. Whether you had bad luck because of the recession or simply haven’t been able to amass a lot of money, there are steps you can take to secure your retirement.
Boost your savings, pay down debt, or scale back your cost of living if you’re worried about your money potentially running out. The sooner you act, the more secure your future.Dec 11, 2013

Fisheries and Oceans Minister Jonathan Wilkinson says the government is looking at creating new areas of critical habitat off the west coast of Vancouver Island for southern resident killer whales.
Wilkinson says the protected areas of Swiftsure, in the Juan de Fuca Strait between Vancouver Island and Washington state, and Le Perouse Banks off Tofino, will be areas where the whales can spend significant time undisturbed.
The minister says the government will be able to prohibit a range of activities in these areas including shipping.
The new measures are part of a previously announced $167.4-million whales initiative aimed at improving prey availability and reducing disturbance to the whales.
Southern resident killer whales were listed as endangered in 2003, and only 74 of them remain in the wild.

CNN Staff On New Hire Lewandowski: "Inexcusable" And "Unprofessional" Behavior, Repeatedly “Faced Accusations Of Being Overly Aggressive”
Research ››› ›››
CNN has hired former Donald Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski despite his history of allegedly manhandling a female reporter, reportedly making “unwanted romantic advances” and “sexual comments about female journalists,” and reportedly “pushing a CNN reporter.” CNN’s own staff previously criticized Lewandowski, calling his behavior "inexcusable" and "unprofessional" and noting he has “faced accusations of being overly aggressive.” Two CNN contributors also signed a letter calling for Trump to fire Lewandowski.

CNN Contributors S.E. Cupp And Mary Katharine Ham Signed Letter Describing Lewandowski's Behavior Toward Reporter Michelle Fields "Inexcusable" And Calling For His Firing. CNN.com wrote in March:
Conservative radio host Dana Loesch, Townhall editor Katie Pavlich, Fox News contributor Meghan McCain and 13 other female conservatives signed a letter on Wednesday stating that Lewandowski's "inexcusable" and "unprofessional" behavior toward former Breitbart News reporter Michelle Fields was grounds for termination.
"Donald Trump should immediately remove Lewandowski from his campaign," the letter read.
Fields has accused Lewandowski of yanking her arm after a campaign event in Jupiter, Florida, earlier this month. Lewandowski has been charged with minor battery, though Trump said Tuesday night that video of the incident "exonerates him" of any wrongdoing.

Anchor Ashleigh Banfield Noted Lewandowski’s Defense About Fields Was Incorrect. From a segment on Banfield’s CNN show
BANFIELD: This is what Corey Lewandowski tweeted out on March the 10th. That's two days after the event. And I believe the day before the actual charge was - was filed. "Michelle Fields, you are totally delusional. I never touched you. As a matter of fact, I have never even met you." Whether, in fact, he remembers not meeting her, I think the video shows that they clearly met and certainly that there was some kind of touching that was going on. So, again, that was - and then the tweets got even rougher. [CNN, Legal View With Ashleigh Banfield, 3/29/16, via CNN.com]
Stelter Noted Lewandowski “Chang[ed] His Story” About Fields Incident.
BRIAN STELTER, CNN SENIOR MEDIA CORRESPONDENT: So, initially, when this happened on March 8, he said nothing happened. The Secret Service told them nothing, that everybody was OK, that there was no footage of this incident. He also said that he thought she was making it up, and Corey Lewandowski said he thought she was an attention seeker.
Now that there is this new video he's changing his story and focusing on her as a possible threat. We also heard from Lewandowski's lawyer on "The Today Show". He said Fields changed her story. Initially she suggested she was almost yanked to the ground and now she's not saying that. Here's what the lawyer said this morning. [CNN, CNN Newsroom, 3/30/16, via CNN.com]
Banfield On Lewandowski-Fields Incident: “Trying To Physically Curtail The Press In An Open Country Like Ours Is The Problem.” During her show, Banfield said that “maybe he shouldn't have grabbed someone hard like that. It's not about the apology, it's about the action.” She added: “I think trying to physically curtail the press in an open country like ours is the problem.” [CNN, Legal View With Ashleigh Banfield, 3/29/16, via CNN.com]

Which is more fun to watch: a 7-footer attempting to guard a backcourt player who leads the conference in three-point shooting, or a guard trying to guard a 7-footer who might be a first-round NBA draft choice some day?
Such odd matchups will be a major part of Stanford's game against Oregon today, and the team that is less embarrassed defensively should be the winner.
No. 23 Stanford (13-2, 2-1) and the Ducks (11-4, 2-1) are as different as two teams can be.
Oregon starts four guards and a small forward and is the only team in the Pac-10 averaging more than 80 points a game. Fast and loose is the Ducks' style. They lead the conference in three-pointers made and attempted, and their one starting big man is among the conference leaders in three-point shooting.
Stanford typically starts two 7-footers, and is eighth nationally in scoring defense, yielding 56.1 points a game. The Cardinal want to slow the pace and slug it out in the halfcourt, using their size to overpower teams. They are fourth nationally in rebounding margin and lead the Pac-10 in blocked shots.
Contrasting styles often create intriguing matchups, like Muhammad Ali against Joe Frazier and Bjorn Borg versus John McEnroe.
"We're like completely different teams," Stanford sophomore Brook Lopez said.
At some point today, perhaps at the outset, the 7-foot Lopez will be asked to guard 6-6 guard Malik Hairston, who leads the conference in three-point shooting at 51.7 percent and is the Ducks' top scorer. Lopez had that task last season and fared fairly well.
"I always enjoy trying to guard players who are quicker," he said, "and it's good to know Robin is behind me."
Sophomore Robin Lopez, Brook's 7-foot twin brother and the conference's leader in blocked shots, is often back there to pick up players who beat their Stanford defender. However, it's uncertain whether Robin will be in the starting lineup today. He came off the bench for the first time in his college career in Thursday's win over Oregon State, with 6-8 Lawrence Hill starting in the post spot opposite Brook Lopez. If Hill starts the game, he will probably start out guarding Hairston, although the Lopezes will be in there together at some point.
What lineup Trent Johnson will use remains a mystery - even to the players. They don't know who will start until about 10 minutes before the game when they see the five starters' names on the blackboard.
Even if Hill starts, Brook Lopez will have to wander out to the perimeter to defend 6-9 Maarty Leunen, who is hitting better than 44 percent of his three-pointers.
"I just think of our advantages in those matchups because we have the twins down there," Hill said.
Last season, Brook Lopez had six points and four fouls in limited playing time in the 66-59 loss at Oregon, but he had 26 points in the 88-69 victory over the Ducks at Stanford.
Both teams figure to play some zone defense because of the odd matchups. But Oregon, like Stanford, is basically a man-to-man team, and Hairston presumably will guard one of the Lopezes at times today.
Oregon's starting lineup is somewhat in flux, too. Joevan Catron will miss his fourth straight game with a foot injury, and 5-6 sophomore Tajuan Porter has come off the bench the past two games as he struggles through a shooting slump - 3-for-27 (11.1 percent) on three-pointers the past five games. Kamyron Brown has become the starting point guard and guard Churchill Odia probably will be the fifth starter, along with Hairston, Leunen and Bryce Taylor.
One other variable surfaced out of nowhere Thursday: Frantz Dorsainvil, a 6-8, 260-pound fourth-year junior, did not play at all his first three seasons at Oregon. He had barely played this season either, until Thursday against Cal, when he played 23 meaningful minutes and hit 4 of 5 field-goal attempts.

Goals from Pere Milla and Sergi Enrich in a 10-minute spell either side of the interval saw the Spanish club complete a routine victory, despite Jordi Amat’s header, as the Swans faded after a bright opening half-hour at the Janbach Stadium.
They now have just one fixture remaining — against Freiburg on Friday — before the serious business of the Championship season gets under way.
Potter had spoken prior to the game of the need for Swansea to step up for this contest and Friday’s clash with Freiburg with places up for grabs in the season-opener at Sheffield United a week on Saturday.
There were a few who would have done their chances no harm at all in a game the tourists started and finished strongly.
Yan Dhanda continued his encouraging pre-season form with some assured touches and an ability to find space between the lines, while Jefferson Montero — still building his way up to full fitness after reporting late for pre-season duty — served up a few reminders of the threat his pace can pose.
There were also promising passages of play, particularly in the first half as some of the hard work being done by Potter and his staff on the training ground starts to reap some rewards.
But the Swans boss would have been disappointed with the pair of defensive lapses that allowed Eibar to profit from two of the few genuine chances, as well as his own side’s inability to create opportunities in the final third and work the opposition keeper.
Indeed, Swansea have just two goals from 210 minutes of football in Germany and Austria thus far.
There were notable absentees in the form of Federico Fernandez, Andre Ayew and Jordan Ayew.
Fernandez has been nursing a dead leg and is considering a move to FC Krasnodar in Russia, while Andre Ayew was left out as talks continue over a loan move to Fenerbahce for the Ghanaian.
Jordan Ayew, meanwhile, is a target for Leicester according to reports in his homeland .
Yet Swansea had started brightly, with Oli McBurnie linking play nicely in the early stages and there was one lovely flowing passage of play in the 13th minute that took play all the way from keeper Nordfeldt up to the striker in the opposition box.
Both sides were comfortable for the most part but it was Eibar — who finished ninth in La Liga last term — who took the lead when Swansea switched off and Milla was able to tuck home at the far post.
Potter made just one change at the break as Erwin Mulder replaced Kristoffer Nordfeldt in goal, but the Dutchman was soon picking the ball out of his net as Amat and Mike van der Hoorn got themselves in a muddle to allow Enrich to regain possession, turn and find the bottom corner.
As both sides made substitutions at regular intervals so the game became scrappy and seemed to be petering out until Amat made some amends for his earlier error by nodding home from a Matt Grimes free-kick with four minutes left.
Swansea thought they should have had a chance to equalise from the spot in a strong finish, but Nathan Dyer’s appeal was waved away.The General Social Care Council and Bath and North East Somerset Council failed to check the criminal file of a social worker who had been convicted of conspiring to murder her husband, a judge has concluded.
The GSCC and the council relied on Lynda Barnes’ “highly sanitised” account of her conviction, as well as her “excellent references” in, respectively, placing her on the social care register and employing her as a manager in children’s services.
‘Serious failings’
The evidence emerged during a care proceedings hearing last year where the judge slammed “serious failings” by the authority and Barnes in the handling of a child protection case involving three children. Barnes lied under oath and also “fabricated” evidence, the court found.
The family court judgement naming Barnes, published yesterday, revealed that she had been a social worker at Avon Council in the child care department when she was convicted for conspiring to murder her husband.
She was given a two-year suspended sentence on 24 March 1995 at Bristol Crown Court. Barnes had pleaded guilty on the second day of the trial, and her co-conspirator was jailed for 38 months.
Disclosure of conviction
She disclosed the conviction when she joined Bath and North East Somerset Council on 30 September 2005 as an assistant team manager, and became team manager on 2 November 2006. Barnes was also registered with the General Social Care Council in January 2006.
The court was told that Barnes’ pre-sentence report had concluded that her “sense of reality is blurred with her fantasies” and that she did not accept her actions were “in any way real”.
But while Judge Barclay said it was “clear” that Barnes had given Bath and North East Somerset Council authority to see her criminal file, it had failed to do so. He also concluded that it was “probably unlikely” that the GSCC had seen it, given the evidence received by the court.
‘Highly regrettable’
“In giving full authority for her file to be retrieved [Barnes] could not have known that both of those bodies would separately fail to secure sight of it. To my mind it is highly regrettable that they did not do so, but it was not her fault,” the judge said.
In a statement to the court, a social worker, known as B, said that people were “frightened” of Barnes, describing her as a “force to be reckoned with”.
Lies
If staff did not agree with Barnes, they were told “life could be made very difficult,” she said. B also gave a number of instances where Barnes had lied to others.
Barnes denied the allegations, but the judge concluded that B was an “entirely honest and sincere witness”.
Another social worker involved in the case, known as C, said she was asked by Barnes to lie to the court during the hearing.
During the case, the judge agreed with a request from the counsel for the father of one of the children to produce Barnes’s Criminal Records Bureau certificate, which the council had previously refused. Then her history was fully dislosed.
‘Overwhelming’ case for publicity
All details of the case were made public yesterday in a revised version of the 22 December transcript, alongside a ruling from 28 April this year where Judge Barclay said the case for publicity was “overwhelming”.
The judge said he wanted to make it clear that Lynda Barnes should not be confused with another employee of the same authority – Linda Barnes – who had played no part in the case.
Council response
Bath and North East Somerset Council said today that it had apologised to the families involved in the case and admitted it had “made a mistake” in employing Barnes.
The council has commissioned an independent review of 17 cases were Barnes was significantly involved and said this would be made public.
The council confirmed that Barnes had resigned on 31 March this year and that it had referred her case to the GSCC. Barnes is still on the social care register.
GSCC response
The GSCC confirmed that it was investigating Barnes’ actions and applying to suspend her on a temporary basis, while pointing out that a criminal conviction was not a bar to registration. A spokeswoman could not confirm whether Barnes had asked to be taken off the register as this was considered a “private matter.”
She also said that the GSCC could not allow someone to leave the register when a complaint was outstanding, adding: “When serious allegations are made against a registrant we have a duty, to the complainant and in the interests of ensuring the integrity of social work, to investigate and follow through to a conclusion. We believe it is right that a public hearing is held, in the interests of transparency and public accountability.”
The spokeswomen said that the GSCC had taken into account the length of time since Barnes’ offence, the context behind it, the sanction given by the court, and her six year’s work in child protection before her application when registering her in 2006.
“[Barnes] had positive references and that her employer at the time [Bath and North East Somerset] endorsed the application and were aware of her conviction and she had been working for them before registration came into force,” she said.
The spokeswoman added:“In cases such as this we gather together as much information from third parties as possible, such as the employer and/or the courts where relevant, to enable us to assess the person’s suitability. We are of course reliant on others for the quality and accuracy of that information.”

It’s not really a laughing matter – the Frankenstorm is enormous, and won’t be very much fun for anyone caught in its way. Google’s already (mildly) felt the brunt of it, having to cancel its Android event due to the potential for hurricane-based death.
With that off the cards, though, the big G’s had time to put something else together: a Hurricane Sandy crisis map. Are you in any danger?
The map plots the path of the hurricane, as well as jotting down what to expect in each area, updated on the fly as new info comes in. There’s also stats and info about the Frankenstorm, and links to relevant content.
On top of that, Google’s created a bespoke map of New York City, with more ground-level info such as evacuation zones. To help things further, both the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal have lifted their paywalls until the threat literally blows over.

These are factors you cannot possibly control!
As a therapist, literally half of my job is to question negative thoughts and also to teach clients how to have influence over their thoughts. A concept I really emphasize is Control vs. Influence. You can’t necessarily control all factors of your job search, but you can influence most, if not all, of your job search.
Positive thoughts is an excellent way to influence your online teaching job search.
Here are some types of thoughts and how you can influence positive thinking.
- All or nothing thinking – this is looking at situations as either black or white. You may say “if my CV isn’t perfect, I won’t get the job,” or “I am wasting my time applying because I don’t meet all the requirements.” You can challenge these thoughts by asking yourself “what evidence do I have?” What is the worst thing that can happen? What happens if you don’t try?
- Overgeneralization – this is assuming you wouldn’t get the job based on a few rejections. This would be before you even submitted the application. You are wondering how this time may be different, or if it is even different at all. Think about all the positive outcomes here. Again, think about what happens if you didn’t? You would get the same outcome. You can have influence over this by applying for the job and giving it your best shot. The more applications the better.
- Not giving yourself enough credit – You might say “it was pure luck that I was hired by those three schools, but I’ll never take on a fourth school.” Thinking positively, you can say to yourself “the first three schools took note of my expertise and experience, and another school will see that too. I just need to find the right fit.”
The idea here is that there is always two ways of looking at a situation. You may have had a job interview that didn’t go too well. What went wrong? Instead of thinking of it as a failure, think about what you learned from the interview and how you can use that going forward in your online teaching job search. How will you nail that interview next time?
I’d like to leave you with a small activity to do. Take some time out of your day every now and then to write down three to five things that are going well with your job search. Use those as strengths to build off of. Are there things you think you can improve on? You can use these as suggestions and build on them as well. Keep your stress level in mind, and remember to take time out of your search every now and then to reward yourself after you have met a certain goal.

This store is the slowest I’ve ever been to - the duel drive thru sucks and people cut you off due to waiting for so long
I'm not sure if this is the , Corporate Office. I love the food. The employees are piss disgusting poor. At $12.00 an hour. I really can't wait until these lame ducks are replaced by robots. We went on two occasions to : Carl's Jr. 1205 W. Colton Ave Redlands Ca 92374. The skinny male Hispanic adult at will employee working as a cook was staring at a customer. This is a violation of : Calif. Penal Code: 415. Under challenging and dueling. The worthless manager allowed this hazing and harassment. Next: A nice customer was just having a very respectable conversation with a female Hispanic adult. Her name is : Jessica. She was heard asking the customer personal questions : Like what is you're name. Next observed incident : The previous skinny male Hispanic adult observed staring a customers. Again was allowed to be : Rude, arrogant, sarcastic. When the paying customer was speaking nicely and respectfully to ; Jessica the female Hispanic adult cashier, the very same skinny male Hispanic adult previously observed staring at customers , was observed whispering in , Jessica's ear. Apparently, he invited his self into a conversation he was not invited into. Its obviously apparent, his motive and intent was to be sarcastic and turn the conversation and words shared by the customer into a joke. The motive and intent is obvious: To put a customer down . People do this to make their self look good. Due to a low self esteem. Jessica , the female Hispanic adult , found the arrogance, rudeness, disrespect so entertaining she laughed in hysterical laughter. To aid and abet in the disrespecting a paying customer the male Hispanic adult working at the drive through laughed in disrespecting a customer. This incident took place: Nov. 20, 2018. Time:9:00 P.M. The manager turned a blind eye and condoned of the disrespecting a paying customer. Note: If any action a at will employee does is not in the employee hand book or pre-implied contract. This is grounds for termination. For breach of contract. Calif. Civil Codes: 3300-3400. I would terminate the onsite manager, Jessica, the at will employee the male Hispanic adult working the drive through and the primary trouble maker at will employee. The male Hispanic adult observed staring at paying customers. He has a mustache. He turned a inteligent conversation shared by a customer into a joke. To impress his co workers. Jessica condoned of his actions, the manager turned a blind and condoned of his unjustified actions, then the male Hispanic adult working the drive through joined into the laugh and disrespect a customer party. How does their unjustified actions coincide with : Respect, honor and excellent customer service? Also: The at will employee line cook was observed not changing the gloves. Was touching boxes , metal shelfs with the very same gloves he was using to touch paying customer's food. He should have taken off those gloves. Wash his hands. Then when put on new clean gloves. The new clean gloves should only touch food nothing else. This is because of a worthless lame duck, empty suite onsite manager that does not care about the health & safety of paying customers. Plus : This is a violation of the Food Service Code. This is : F.D.A. Code: 3-301.11. D. Third paragraph, third sentence. The corporation should terminate the worthless lame duck manager , Jessica and the at will employee working the drive through . That aided & abetted , in the laugh party disrespecting a customer. Plus: The main instigator, male Hispanic adult with a mustache staring at paying customer's. This is a violation of : California Penal Code: 415. Under challenging and dueling. This is also hazing, and harassment. A violation of ; Calif. Gov. Code: 12900. If all their unjustified actions are not in the , employee hand book or the pre-implied contract. This is grounds for termination of all. For breach of implied contract. Calif. Civil Codes: 3300-3400. This last observed incident took plate at: 11/20/2018.

“I guess you been in the army, stranger,” said Sam, looking down at the leg.
“No, sir, I’ve never been in the army,” said the Englishman.
“Fought a duel somewhere, I guess,” suggested Sam.
“No, sir, never fought a duel.”
“Been wrecked on the cars, perhaps?”
“No, sir; nothing of that kind.”
Sam tried various dodges, but to no effect, and at last, almost out of patience with himself, as well as with the gentleman, whose patience was very commendable, he determined on a direct inquiry as to the nature of the accident which caused the gentleman to lose his leg.
“I will tell you,” replied the Englishman, “on condition that you will promise not to ask me another question.”
“Very well,” said Sam, “just tell me how you lost that leg, and I won’t ask you another question.”
“Well, sir,” remarked the Englishman, “it was bit off!”
“Bit off!” cried Sam. “Wa’al, I declare; I should jes like to know what on airth---“
“No, sir, not another question,” interrupted the Englishman, “not one.”
When Sam Bacon reached Bridgeport, he was taken down with a sick headache. His curiosity was too much for him, and he died without ever having it satisfied.

Want to live a unique experience at the campsite Sunêlia Perla Di mare Porto-Vecchio? From France, you can go to Porto-Vecchio by plane (Figari airport) or by boat from Marseille. From Corsica, you can reach the city by bus (line Bonifacio-Bastia) or by train (station of Ajaccio or Casamozza).This year, on the second Sunday of March, most of the country will move their clocks one hour ahead, marking the beginning of Daylight Saving Time. This effectively moves one hour of daylight from the morning to the evening, giving us longer summer nights. But waking up the following Monday morning may not be so easy, having lost an hour of sleep. How these time changes will affect you depends on your own personal sleep habits, and lifestyle.\n\u201cThe fundamental problem we have in our current 24\/7 society is that everyone is already experiencing some sleep deprivation,\u201d says Patrick J. Strollo Jr., MD, Medical Director of the University of Pittsburgh\u2019s Sleep Disorder Program. \u201cWhen we make even small adjustments in sleep schedules, that can have a negative impact.\u201d\nMoving our clocks in either direction changes how much our bodies\u00a0are exposed to light, which is the principal factor for setting and resetting our 24-hour natural cycle, or circadian rhythm. In doing so, our internal clock becomes out of sync with our current day-night cycle. An unwritten rule is that it will take about one day for your body to adjust for each hour of time change. However, this might vary by individual.\nWhat can you do to reset your internal clock to adapt more quickly to the time changes? Your 24 hour natural cycle is internally generated but it can also be influenced by the environment, behavior, and medications. Here are some steps you can take to avoid sleep deprivation and help ease the transition to the time change.\n4 Steps to Adjust to the Time Change\n1.) Light is the dominant environmental cue. Light suppresses the secretion of the sleep-inducing hormone melatonin. So it is important to expose yourself to the light as much as possible while you are awake, and to limit your exposure to bright light when it is dark outside. For example, if you get up at night to go to the bathroom, you should not turn on the light. Prepare beforehand by placing a night light in the bathroom.\n2.) Plan ahead. Make the time change incrementally by setting your alarm clock 15 minutes earlier and earlier for five consecutive days. So, when the time change actually hits, you\u2019re already there.\n3.) Create sleep-friendly environments to increase your chances of falling asleep easier, staying asleep longer, and sleeping more soundly. Try to reduce or eliminate consuming caffeine and alcohol, and avoid exercising before bedtime. Establish relaxing rituals before bed to gradually calm yourself such as taking a hot bath, and wearing ear plugs and\/or eye masks.\n4.) Get some exercise. Exercise helps advance the body clock, just as bright light exposure does. Exercise also raises your body temperature and helps you feel more energized.Free Instagram Training 📲 .

This terrestrial planet (aka. rocky) orbits Proxima Centauri, an M-type (red dwarf) star located 4.2 light-years beyond our Solar System – and is a part of the Alpha Centauri system. In addition to its proximity and rocky composition, it is also located within its parent star’s habitable zone (HZ).
Until a mission can be sent to this planet (such as Breakthrough Starshot), astrobiologists are forced to postulate about the possibility that life could exist there. Unfortunately, an international campaign that monitored Proxima Centauri for months using nine space- and ground-based telescopes recently spotted an extreme flare coming from the star, one which would have rendered Proxima b uninhabitable.
The campaign was led by Meredith A. MacGregor, an assistant professor of astrophysics from the University of Colorado Boulder, and included members from the Carnegie Institution for Science, Sydney Institute for Astronomy (SIfA), CSIRO Astronomy and Space Science, Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI), the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA), and multiple universities.
M-type stars like Proxima Centauri are a class of low-mass, low-luminosity stars that are known to be variable and unstable compared to other classes. In particular, these stars are prone to flare-ups, which occur when there’s a shift in their magnetic fields that accelerates electrons to near light-speed (NLS). These electrons interact with the star’s plasma, causing an eruption that produces emissions across the entire electromagnetic (EM) spectrum.
To determine how much Proxima Centauri flares, the research team observed the star for 40 hours over the course of several months in 2019. This included the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP), Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), Hubble Space Telescope (HST), Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), and the du Pont Telescope.
These telescopes recorded a massive flare on May 1st, 2019, capturing the event as it produced a wide-EM spectrum of radiation and tracing its timing and energy in unprecedented detail. As MacGregor explained in a recent Carnegie Science press release:
“The star went from normal to 14,000 times brighter when seen in ultraviolet wavelengths over the span of a few seconds… If there was life on the planet nearest to Proxima Centauri, it would have to look very different than anything on Earth. A human being on this planet would have a bad time.”
Since red dwarfs are rather dim compared to other types of stars, flare-ups are not likely to produce much in the way of visible light. Ordinarily, astronomers consider themselves lucky if they can observe flares of this kind with just two instruments. This campaign was the first time that astronomers were able to get multi-wavelength coverage of a stellar flare, which allowed them to observe the huge surges in ultraviolet and millimeter-wave radiation.
The team’s findings, which appeared in The Astrophysical Journal Letters on April 21st, constitute one of the most in-depth anatomies of a flare from any star in our galaxy. In the future, these signals could help researchers gather more information about how stars generate flares, which could have immense implications for exoplanet and habitability studies. Unfortunately, it does not bode well for planets like Proxima b.
This research is the latest in a series of papers and studies conducted since Proxima b was discovered that indicate how the system is not suitable for life. As the closest exoplanet to Earth, and located in the star’s HZ, Proxima b is the most likely candidate for follow-up observations and astrobiological surveys. But according to this latest study, the flares it emits would have likely rendered the planet sterile a long time ago. As Weinberger explained:
“Proxima Centauri is of similar age to the Sun, so it’s been blasting its planets with high energy flares for billions of years. Studying these extreme flares with multiple observatories lets us understand what its planets have endured and how they might have changed. Now we know these very different observatories operating at very different wavelengths can see the same fast, energetic impulse.”
Beyond Proxima Centauri, the findings could also have implications for all planets that orbit within the HZs of red dwarf stars. M-type dwarfs are the most common type of stars in our galaxy and account for about 70% of stars in the entire Universe. Of the over 4,375 exoplanets that have been confirmed to date, a statistically significant number of the “Earth-like” planets have been found orbiting M-type dwarfs.
This has led many astronomers to speculate that the best place to find potentially habitable rocky planets is in red dwarf star systems. For this to be true, most of these stars would have to be significantly less active than Proxima Centauri. On a more positive note, the research suggests that our closest stellar neighbor could have more surprises in store for astronomers, like previously unknown types of flares that demonstrate exotic physics.
This research was conducted with support provided by the NASA Goddard Space Center.

The Importance of Family Bond
Our family, our first and foremost ideal instance that represents love, the bond, that creates the finest sentiments known to man seem to be under threat today. Children hardly appreciate what their parents are doing for them. The Family Bond seems to weaken.
A family that can bond together will be a family that is united forever. But who is to be blamed ? Is it today digital’s age!! Parents!! Society!! Education system!! Peer groups !! Social Media!!
Probably all of them. Increasing affluence, estrangement between husband and wife, the erosion of parental authority which were previously unheard are becoming an alarming issue in almost every states.
In societies where families were united by kinship ties, divorces were uncommon. The burden of living separately are faced by those innocent children who in turn no longer believe in family ties. Related articles and studies have concluded that most children are faced with the brunt of conflicts between their parents. This impact negatively on their behaviour and health. This truly weaken the family bond. Children become mentally disturbed and this is why they even grow up with this misunderstanding that a healthy relationship does not even exist. They are thus mostly likely to repeat the same mistake.
What can you do now to save the family bond?
Does a concession helps? This is when both the husband and wife reach an agreement that they will save their marital life and make it prosper. Doing things out of obligation will certainly not help in the future because with time you will feel the burden in your hearts that you had no other options but to save your children from suffering. A concession should be done in mutual respect and rekindle the love between the husband and wife. Life is short. Save your marital life now.
If your relationship is not working out, you both need to sit down and talk. Communication is the key point. Communicate your honest feelings to each other, talks about your weaknesses and strengths and learn to solve problems.
Do not marry just for the sake of the society if you are not ready to enter a relationship. Commitment is far much better than compromise. It is true that we need certain adjustment and we need to compromise. But what’s the use of such a compromise when both partners are not happy with each other.
Teach your children values and cultures. Be friends with them so that they can easily share with you. Don’t think of being harsh or way too strict with them. You will create the gap. You just need to erase that gap and protect them. That’s how you protect your family bond.
Teach them about the dangers that they might face in the society. Spend more time with them, play with them, have dinner with them, plan vacations with them and share stories that will inspire them.
Is the new social media and digital network causing the generation gap?
You cannot prevent your children from using new technology. This is their era. Technological innovations are now giving people around the world new opportunities to shape their own destinies. It seems most people can no longer live without technologies. They play an important role in the education system of children. You cannot deprive them of their rights but you can control what they are using, you can limit what they are using.
Technology can however become a barrier if children are misusing it. It is the role of parents and the educational system to have control over them.
Parents wake up!! be aware of the various problems faced by technology today. Be aware of cyber bullying. Be aware with whom your children chat with. I will not say about having full control over them but warn and protect them.
Whether only one parent brings in income in the house, do not underestimate your partner. Plan everything together and share the happiness and worries together. Maintain the balance in your relationships. If you see, you cannot make more children, opt for family planning. Why put a child on earth when you can’t fulfil his/her needs?
If you want to save your family bond, spare more time for your family. Having troubles at work?
As soon as you enter your home, leave the baggage of troubles outside. At home, you are the parent and you have your partner to take care of. Respect.
In life, we all will face some good and bad experiences. But if your family bond is strong, you can face it together.
”Family is the most important thing in the world.” – Princess Diana

intended for Really encourage Your own home Current Residence|Comfy AspirationPropertyNews organizations including the New York Times and Wall Street Journal reported that Allergan is nearing a deal to sell itself to Actavis for more than $62.5 billion. That would top an offer of about $53 billion put together by Valeant and Bill Ackman's hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management, which has built a large stake in Allergan.
Representatives of Actavis did not immediately return calls seeking comment from The Associated Press.
Allergan Inc. has resisted for months the unsolicited bids of Canada's Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. It has questioned Valeant's business model, which relies on acquisitions for growth, and its cost-cutting plans. Valeant has said it is committed to funding important research.
The companies have taken their takeover battle to federal court, and Allergan faces a Dec. 18 shareholder meeting at which its stock owners will have a chance to vote out most of its board.
In shunning Valeant for Actavis, Allergan would be favouring another drugmaker that leans heavily on acquisitions. In July, Actavis completed a $28 billion deal for fellow drugmaker Forest Laboratories. Last year, it bought Ireland's Warner Chilcott for $8.5 billion, a year after merging with generic drugmaker Watson Pharmaceuticals.
Shares of Allergan climbed $8.85, or 4.5 per cent, to $207.50 in premarket trading about two hours before markets opened Monday. The stock had already jumped about 79 per cent so far this year, as of Friday's close. U.S.-traded shares of Actavis also were up nearly 3 per cent, or $7.17, to $250.94. Shares of Valeant were down $1.71 at US$132.50.Are we the only ones constantly craving ice-cream in this heatwave? Didn’t think so.

Michael Nau has well and truly taken off since his departure from Page France and Cotton Jones.
His path has taken him to more folksy music. With his romantic crooner voice, he distinguishes himself in this mid-tempo alternative country with groovy tones. A melancholic poet, he juggles with emotions in the room of guitarist Benny Yurco, in Vermont, where Michael Nau & the Mighty Thread was recorded. No doubt, it is truly the sequel to Some Twist, his solo album from 2017.
The guitars perform in a humpback song with distortions that get lost into echos ( Can't Take One). Nau mixes with the worlds of Fred Neil, Tim Hardin or Richard Hawley. There’s no temporal marker here, but a blend of past, present and future. This songwriter with poetic phrasings even tries his hand at Southern soul for his last title Smudge. Is there anything better when you talk about love, memories and loneliness?

Anderson has purchased two double-rider snow tubes from Waterloo-based Tube Pro for his children. The inner tubes cushion and protect, the polyester canvas resists tearing and the urethane bottom has give.
"So, if they hit a bump, the tubes absorb it and they can ride it out comfortably, versus something hard and having their bottoms on it, or (bumps injuring) their spines or backs," he says.
Robinson Park is perfect for Anderson’s wee ones. While more a hump than a hill, it runs into a soccer pitch with lots of space for deceleration. And with one mild jump near the bottom, there are opportunities for air, much to the glee of the tobogganing tykes.
Sliding has been big news for the past two weeks — in some instances eclipsing the layoffs at Lockerby mine and the return of the ombudsman to city hall.
The city reached an agreement to settle last November pertaining to a lawsuit brought forth by a 40-something man who injured his spine sliding at Queen’s Athletic field on Feb. 9, 2014 (the agreement has yet to be finalized). In December, the city cordoned off the hill with orange safety fencing. It also posted four no-sliding signs at hills around town; however, staff at Tuesday’s meeting indicated they had been removed, pending the completion of risk analyses.
Real Carre, the city’s director of leisure services, says the hill at Queen’s Athletic field, which is actually a berm, simply could not co-exist with the skating oval.
"Because of this particular accident, as well as a number of other close calls, the risk element of leaving this unofficial hill was way too risky," he says.
Carre notes there have been three lawsuits against the city since 2005 related to tobogganing. The City of Greater Sudbury maintains $50 million worth of general liability, with a $50,000 deductible. While it does not pay a supplemental fee to insure unofficial hills, injury claims are covered within the city’s insurance policy.
Anderson understands the city’s conservative approach to sliding.
"You do need to use your better judgment; if you don’t, you end up getting yourself into trouble," he says. "I guess the city does have to step in to give that better judgment sometimes. You definitely don’t want to see your child getting hurt, or an adult who should know better, but doesn’t."
Dr. Chris Bourdon, chief of staff and an emergency room physician at Health Sciences North, says tobogganing is not nearly as dangerous as its recent reputation.
"A typical injury would be orthopedic in nature — usually a fracture, a wrist, a shoulder, collarbone or perhaps an ankle — similar to what you’d most commonly see in other winter sports, like downhill skiing," he says. "You’re generating some speed in slippery conditions and if you’re upright or lying flat and you get projected, well these are things that would most commonly happen."
The smaller the child, the higher the risk, Bourdon says.
"More likely younger kids are going to toboggan, so they’re the ones who are more likely susceptible to injuries — they have smaller weights, so they tend to fly a little faster and they become projectiles, if you will," he says.
Bourdon likens the current media coverage to public awareness campaigns surrounding snowmobiling, which have evolved over the past 20 years.
"The positive is that we’re having a conversation. Times have changed and this conversation wouldn’t have occurred 45 years ago," he says. "When I was a kid, you found the highest, steepest hill you could when the snow came. There was usually a road or a highway at the end of that hill, and until some kid slid across it, that’s when your mom said, ‘nope, that’s not safe’."
Bourdon admits head and spinal injuries can occur, including concussions, but they are rare. His solution? Parents must be reasonable and sensible, tobogganers need to take responsibility, and researchers need to gather data, rather than impose outright bans on activities that promote health and development.
"Kids need to get outdoors; this is part of being Canadian and part of being a northerner," Bourdon says. "There are bumps and snow. You should get a magic carpet or GT or a toboggan, but you need to understand the innate risks in all of them. … There is a risk of getting hurt, but there’s a risk of getting hurt when you cross the street, but you need to get to the other side."
Unofficial hills, Carre says, are not supervised or maintained; however, the city has placed hay bales and pads around lamp posts. At the Elizabeth Street slope, employees have installed a half-dozen saw horses to block vehicles from parking in the hill’s landing zone.
"If people are using city-owned properties to participate in recreational activities, as a director, I have a responsibility to get to those sites to have a look, especially the popular unofficial sliding hills, to reduce risk" Carre says.
According to a 2012 report published by the Canadian Institute for Health Information, tobogganing actually accounts for fewer serious injuries than one might expect, given the recent media coverage.
Of 5,629 hospitalizations in 2010-11, more than 1,110 were related to hockey and only 171 to tobogganing, down from 252 in 2006-07 (these statistics do not include visits to doctors’ offices or emergency rooms). Skiing, snowboarding and snowmobiling accounted for 3,455, or 61.4%, of hospitalizations in 2010-11. Throughout Canada only 56 children under the age of 10 required hospitalization for a sliding injury.
The Association of Municipalities of Ontario indicates insurance premiums for mid-size municipalities (those with populations of 75,000-165,000) have skyrocketed since 2007. According to 2011 data, liability insurance was up 26.7% and overall insurance costs, which include property and automobile rates, rose by 27.3%. In 2015, insurance costs for all Ontario municipalities is expected to increase by 16%.
Beyond the peril of an unsafe hill are the upsides to sliding. Health Canada indicates only 4% of Canadian children are adequately active. The federal government recommends 60 minutes of daily moderate to vigorous activity, and cautions that children who fall short of that goal are at increased risk for developing type-2 diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and other cardiovascular illnesses.
Maxine King, co-ordinator of the early childhood education program at Cambrian College, contends play is vital to proper childhood development, especially in an era of video game ubiquity.
"With the advent of video games and computer opportunities, there’s been a tendency for children to spend more time indoors than outdoors," she says. "Getting them outside — running, jumping, climbing — allows them to develop gross motor skills, which they certainly wouldn’t do inside."
Play promotes healthy emotional development, especially amongst school-aged children, and whether indoors or outdoors, encourages the development of risk assessment tools.
"That’s all about the social circle — doing it with others," King says. "What the theorists tell us is that when children are with their peers, those of similar age, along with the social skills the physical skills are going to develop and then they have the opportunity for collaboration, problem-solving and conflict resolution."
In the absence of that tool set, there could be challenges in adulthood.
"If they haven’t had the opportunity to make choices and see the consequences to those behaviours, they wouldn’t be as likely to make some assumptions about the consequences of behaviours later on in life," King explains. "With an older child, if they haven’t had the opportunity to do risk assessment, there’s a likelihood they would make some mistakes."
She admits there are many variables involved in health growth and development, and does not highlight any particular activity as more valuable than another — most kids learn the tools they need in one way or another. The point, King says, is to get children outside and to keep them moving.
Little Kiersten would agree.

It was late on a balmy summer night in Edinburgh, and a friend and his wife were giving me a ride home after a professional event. The conversation turned to the healing powers of poetry. I am used to encountering a wide variety of responses to this new passion of mine: indifference, incredulity, interest and, once in a while, a level of enthusiasm that matches my own. It is rare, however, for someone to be even more excited by this idea than I am. But that’s what happened in the car late on that balmy evening in Edinburgh, when Ilaria Nardini-Gray told me and the other passengers how the poet Rumi had changed her life. I found her narrative so intriguing, so full of glittering nuggets, that I knew I must hear her story again when I was back home and able to record it. She kindly agreed – and here it is:
Ilaria: Transformed by Rumi
I have been thinking a lot about that moment in the car in Edinburgh and the conversation we had about Rumi, and how he has been so life changing for me. To explain I need to give you a little bit of a back story.
I have to take you back to 2014, when I was working in the corporate world and doing really well. I was actually in the drinks industry, selling alcoholic beverages. I was in a relationship and moved abroad with my partner at the time. After being there for about six months, I got unexpected news that my Dad was very ill and probably had only about four weeks to live. As you can imagine, that came as quite a shock. That was a watershed moment in my life.
After my Dad passed, the relationship I was in started to crumble because I began to ask deep soul questions: Who am I? What am I doing with my life? Am I happy? How am I contributing? And if I were to die, would I have regrets? And that line of questioning set me off in a direction, because the answer to most of those questions was “No.” So, within three months, my relationship ended, and I moved back to London. One of my friends saw I was in a very fragile state and kindly flew me out to the Philippines. I was there for about three weeks, and it was there that I really did some deep soul searching. For me, that time was, as they say, the dark night of the soul. I was very depressed, very lost. I had a lot of anxiety. I was suffering from panic attacks, and agoraphobia. I was really struggling and felt disconnected from everything.
Reflection, Religion & Spirituality
As I reflected on my situation, I realized that all my life I had failed to understand who I was as a person. I was very insecure, never really feeling good enough, never feeling that what I was doing was quite enough. It occurred to me that there had to be something more to life. While I was in the Philippines I started to meditate. And again, these questions just kept coming up about who I was, and what my soul and life were all about. I became obsessed with finding answers. I had been brought up Catholic but I’ve never really been religious. I went to Sunday school but I didn’t really connect to the church or God. I started to think about people who have a religion, a sense of meaning or a God, whatever that is. And I started to research a lot of religions—Catholicism, Buddhism, Hinduism, and Islam. I loved Buddhism and elements of Hinduism, and I started reading about Islam. That is when I came across Sufism, the spiritual practice of Islam. At the time I didn’t realize that Rumi was a famous Sufi, but I decided to get some of his books. I came back to London and through the process of my meditation, I decided to leave my job. I had no money and in many ways things were not good, but I had this fire in me to find who I was and to change my life, an urge to heal myself because I realized that what I had previously been doing was not working.
Then my Mum called and told me she was struggling with the loss of my Dad. So, I decided to leave London and go back home to Edinburgh. I wanted to become a coach and help others, and help myself at the same time. I had packed up my belongings, including my books, for the train journey home. The two books I had with me were The Big Red Book and The Essential Rumi, both translations by Coleman Barks. I was a bit hesitant to read them because they were poetry. All I knew about poetry was what I learned in high school English. I remember reading the poems of Philip Larkin, and feeling, “I just don’t get it.” It seemed like something for intellects, not someone like me, who was more a sporty person, and I really struggled with it. That was the last I ever thought of poetry. I had never thought about poetry again – until now. And here I was with two books of Rumi’s poetry. I wondered, “What if I read it and don’t get it and just have to put it all aside?”
Poetry and Her Path
But then I started reading one of the books, and something wonderful happened. Excuse me if I get emotional while I tell it because it was such a defining moment in my life, in my healing. I was on the train and as I began to read Rumi’s poems, the words just healed my soul. I felt a rush of energy pass through my body, my hair stood on end. This was the answer. This was what I had been impatiently looking for about life, about spirituality, about love, the key to everything. There I was on the train, in tears, sobbing my heart out. And everybody around me was looking at me, but I didn’t care, because those were tears of joy, of relief, of “This is it.” I got it. And I feel that my soul shifted and my heart opened. And that’s what happened. And since then I have tried to live by the essence of love. Every day I try and practice and go deeper into that feeling of love. There is a quote by Rumi: Love is the bridge between you and everything. And I have it tattooed on my body because it is so true. It was so different from how I’d been living previously—through fear, through anxiety, through limiting beliefs, and not feeling good enough. It was simple. I realized that If I just change my life and live from a vantage point of love every possible minute, my life would be transformed. And you know what? It was. And some days I’m better than others; I’m only human, of course. But my life changed from there, and I can say that wonderful things have happened to me since reading Rumi’s poems. I believe he is one of the great souls and one of the greatest spiritual teachers. He shows us our glory.
I agree with Coleman Barks that Rumi wants us to be more alive and wake up, and he does so in such an accessible way. And that for me is key because I didn’t think that poetry could ever be accessible to somebody like me. And that’s why I love him and I’m sure that’s why people across the globe resonate with him because the way that he writes is accessible and beautiful and healing, so much so that I often read his poetry and return to my favorites time and again.
I realize that my story sounds almost magical. But discovering Rumi was the turning point for me, and the force by which healing took place. Rumi sent me on that path to go in search of healing my soul. And the life coaching program that I did was fused with neuroscience and mindfulness. And it was just a phenomenal course that opened me up even more. I then went on to train as a spiritual healer, and that again is just based on love and helping others, and that mysterious flow of energy, which Rumi talks about a lot in his poetry. About six months later I met my husband, and it was an unbelievable, magical moment of two souls meeting. And he then showed me also what love is on a level that I had never previously experienced. A few months after that, I got pregnant. That was amazing to me since people had been saying that at my age —I was 34 when I lost my Dad— “You’ve got to meet somebody. How are you going to have children?” But had let that go and say to myself, what will happen will happen. I didn’t know if that was ever going to be my story, to be married and have children. But just by practicing this embodiment of love — love for myself and others – by practicing and living in that state that I learned through Rumi’s poetry, that change occurred. It brought love into my life, first through coaching and helping others, then through my husband. I don’t know if words can express how much I love Rumi, but to give you some indication, we named our daughter Rumi.
As I think back on my life, I realize that I have suffered emotionally since my early twenties. Since finding Rumi four years ago, however, and shifting my life from fear to love, my panic attacks, depression, agoraphobia, and suicidal thoughts have all dissipated. Rumi helped me face all my fears from a place of love and compassion rather than ignoring them and pushing them away into the depths of my being. I have no doubt that Rumi helped me with this change of mindset, and luckily I have never had any of these emotional problems since.

Two Poems by Rumi
Rumi was extremely prolific and wrote hundreds of poems. The Essential Rumi in which celebrated translator Coleman Barks has chosen his choicest poems runs to approximately 350 pages. Incidentally, we are fortunate to have such a superb translator of Rumi as Barks, who is a poet in his own right. To choose just a few delicacies from this feast is clearly to offer a very modest sampling of Rumi’s works, but perhaps it will whet your appetite for more. I have chosen the following two poems not only because they are among his most popular, but also because they embody some of the healing principles that are at the heart of this blog: Acceptance and Reconciliation. I will present each of these first in their written form and then read by Ilaria Nardini-Gray so that you can hear how they sound when they are read to you..
When we consider the astonishing Rumi-inspired transformation that Ilaria describes, it may sound too good to be true. She does, however, suggest that the mechanism by which her life changed involved acceptance of the worries and unhappiness within herself, as she put it:
Rumi helped me face all my fears from a place of love and compassion rather than ignoring them and pushing them away into the depths of my being.
That is the essential message of The Guest House, presented above. Healers of all types have converged on this message: accept your emotions, even when they are unpleasant and hard to face.
You Are Not All Sweetness and Light
When I was in my thirties, I decided to undergo psychoanalysis. For six and a half years, four days a week, I would faithfully make my way to my analyst’s office. It was a small room situated in the basement of his home, dimly lit, paneled with dark wood, and furnished with a simple green couch behind which he would sit in a desk chair and listen to my ramblings. Every now and then he would intervene with brief comments, most of which have long since been forgotten.
One comment, however, I remember clearly because it was so often repeated: “You are not all sweetness and light, you know.” Of course I wasn’t. Nobody is. What my analyst was attempting to do was to peel away my defenses, as advocated by Freud. According to Freud and his disciples, defense mechanisms are at the core of neurotic unhappiness. Analyze them, expose the underlying drives and feelings, and relief will follow. So my analyst was using a time-honored analytic tradition of peeling back defenses to uncover unwelcome feelings. But there was a slightly jarring quality to how he did it. By being told that I was “not all sweetness and light,” I felt as though a little joke was being made at my expense.
I contrast that with the tone of Rumi’s Guest House. With his opening line, “This being human is a guest house,” he makes it clear that the guest house is a metaphor for the human condition. Each of us is like a guest house, and the occupants are our emotions. Although Rumi makes passing reference to joy, most of the “guests” are of the nasty variety: “Depression, meanness, shame, malice, and a crowd of sorrows.” And it is well that the focus should be on these nasty guests, because they are the ones that cause us trouble, the ones we have trouble acknowledging, and with whom we need the most help. And Rumi offers us that help.
Rumi’s Advice
What is Rumi’s advice? “Welcome and entertain them all!” At first glance, this may seem crazy. Even for those who acknowledge that we need to accept negative feelings, the idea of welcoming and entertaining them may seem a bit much! What psychological explanation could there be for this advice? Likewise, for Rumi’s next piece of advice to “treat each guest honorably.” As I see it, this is wise counsel. Negative feelings (as well as positive ones) are a part of who we are. We come by them honestly, even honorably. They reflect our experiences of the world, past and present. When we fail to honor our feelings, we register at some level that we are disrespecting an important part of who we are. We set up a conflict between opposing aspects of ourselves. When we honor our feelings, we begin the work of reconciling this internal conflict.
Rumi’s advice makes me think of a conversation I had with a supervising psychiatrist when I was a junior resident in psychiatry at the New York State Psychiatric Institute. We were taught and supervised by eminent psychiatrists, several of whom were household names in New York City, which is surely one of the psychiatric capitals of the world. I struck up a friendship however with one of the less distinguished psychiatrists who I felt had something to teach me that was different from what I would learn from the others. I asked him if he would supervise me unofficially, and to my delight, he agreed. I will always remember his childlike enjoyment of the world, and the naughty twinkle in his eye that developed when we discussed some of the characters who peopled the Institute. On one occasion, he told me a story about himself in his younger days.
“In my training years, I looked around me and everyone else seemed more accomplished and successful than I was. It was as though their plates were full, and mine was half empty. I envied them, and envy is a painful emotion. So I worked day and night to pile up my plate as full as theirs so I didn’t have to envy them. As a result I had so little time for myself or for any fun that life became insufferable.”
“So how did you resolve it?” I asked.
“I decided it was just easier to envy them,” he said, with his mischievous smile and twinkle in the eye.
I don’t know whether he had ever came across Rumi’s Guest House, but I have no doubt he would have approved of the poet’s advice with regard to unpleasant emotions: “Welcome and entertain them all” and “treat each guest honorably.”
Gratitude
Rumi closes the poem with a final word of advice – to be grateful to these “guests,” even when their arrival is unwelcome because they may be sent as a guide from beyond. Here Rumi shifts from practical advice about handling emotions to spiritual suggestion. Yet even here, by suggesting that our emotions can be a valuable guide, Rumi is once again spot on. Emotions carry with them valuable information. They are a type of intelligence. Fear can steer us away from danger; anxiety can provide a critical warning signal; sadness can tell us to conserve energy and lay low; joy can signal opportunity and propel us to action, and so on. People who cannot feel pain might put their hands on a hot stove. We ignore our feelings at our peril. We prosper when we treat them honorably.
Let us consider another poem by Rumi, which has healing potential.
Out Beyond Ideas
Out beyond ideas of wrongdoing and rightdoing,
there is a field. I’ll meet you there.
When the soul lies down in that grass,
the world is too full to talk about.
Ideas, language, even the phrase each other
doesn’t make any sense
Right and Wrong
Who is in the right and who is in the wrong? That is a question that preoccupies many of us from childhood to old age.
I remember a mother who consulted me about strife at home between her young son and daughter, whom she instructed to sit in my waiting room until she emerged. Before long a furious neighbor banged at my door to announce that the children had ventured into her garden where she had found them dangerously close to a pond. The angry mother scolded the older child, who said, “He ran out first and I went after him to try and stop him.” The younger one responded, “She started! She was so mean. I had to run to get away from her.” So there it was. Who was right and who was wrong? And so it often is even with adult couples who consult me. They lay out their grievances as though presenting a case before a judge. We see this trope in our society, and across different societies. Endless strife, finger pointing and blaming the other. Who is right and who is wrong? What is to be done about it?
In his short poem, Rumi cuts right through the question of right and wrong, and presents us with a vision of what might exist “beyond ideas of wrongdoing and rightdoing.” He tells us that beyond those ideas there is a field and makes an offer: “I’ll meet you there.” It’s as though he is offering to make the first move towards reconciliation and invites us to join him. It is a gentle invitation, without preconditions or arm twisting. Rather, in just a few words he conjures up an enticing scene: Souls lying in the long grass, a world too full to talk, and differences of language, ideas and individual identity that simply melt away once we put aside ideas of right and wrong. It is a glorious vision, but does it have any foundation in reality or is it merely a poet’s dream. What do you think?
Deep Truth
I would suggest that once again, Rumi’s vision embodies a deep truth. In my office I often have found myself pointing out to couples that I am not a judge and we are not in a court of law. We are trying to find a meeting place where two people can get together, lower their defenses and try to remember what attracted them to each other in the first place. One common exercise therapists assign to such couples is to ask each party simply to repeat what the other has said. Just the process of repeating the other person’s words can help you feel how it is to be inside the other person, as though you are lying together in the long grass.
One of the great encounters of my life was meeting the great writer, neurologist and Holocaust survivor Viktor Frankl. In the living room of his summer house outside of Vienna, I asked him many questions, all of which he answered candidly and generously. When I asked whether he had forgiven the Germans for the Holocaust, he responded, “I’m not sure I really understand what the word forgiveness means. I would rather think of reconciliation, the idea that we need to put aside past grievances and get along with each other.” An amazing response from someone whose family had been cruelly killed and who had almost died himself in a death camp. That same conclusion has been reached in many countries where totalitarian regimes have oppressed and tortured their neighbors, then changed hands. In my own country of origin, South Africa, after the fall of the cruel system of Apartheid, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission was set up to allow those who confessed to their crimes under the Apartheid system to receive amnesty.
So, whether we think about children squabbling, couples arguing, or political strife, people all over the world have converged on the concept of reconciliation as the best solution. Once again, Rumi could have told them so.
Who was Rumi?
Rumi was a 13th century poet who lived for most of his life in present day Turkey. He was identified in his youth as a spiritual leader and many of his letters survive, which describe how he helped members of his community solve disputes and get loans from one another.
A pivotal incident in Rumi’s life occurred in 1244 when Rumi met Shams Tabriz, about whom Rumi said, “What I thought of before as God I met today in a human being.” It was after that meeting that Rumi began to write his greatest poems. The two men were such close friends for years that Rumi’s disciples became jealous and when Shams disappeared, it was believed that he had been murdered by one of Rumi’s jealous disciples, perhaps his son. Rumi searched far and wide for his lost friend but eventually had to accept the loss. He dealt with his grief by experiencing Shams as part of himself, writing, “his essence speaks through me.”
Rumi’s poetic production was voluminous, his reputation has grown over the centuries and he has sometimes been called “America’s most popular poet.” He was buried close to his father in Konya, Turkey, and his tomb has become a gathering place for thousands of visitors who have been touched by the great poet and healer.
If anyone deserves a place in the pantheon of those who have healed through poetry, it is Rumi._3<<

I found ‘The Guest House’ particularly impactful. I took the end: ‘Be grateful for whoever comes,
because each has been sent
as a guide from beyond.’ to be saying that our feelings are a guide because if we feel a certain way, such as anger, in a certain situation then we can ask ourselves what it was about this situation that led to our anger and then we can work on changing the way we think about the situation so that overtime as the situation reoccurs we no longe feel anger. So our challenging feelings are a guide for the parts of our lives that we can work on.
Well said, emotions certainly have an ability to direct us to what needs our attention.
Rumi is one of my favorites too. I feel he is always writing about love. usually spiritual love with His Beloved, but it’s all in personal terms. Very beautiful and fills the heart.
Thanks for your contribution to this timely subject

The singer, 77, giving evidence in a damages case against the corporation, said while South Yorkshire police did not name him, the BBC did in its reports featuring footage of police searching his Berkshire apartment taken from a helicopter hovering overhead.
Richard, who has always denied any wrongdoing, and was never arrested or charged in connection with the allegation, was at his home in Portugal when he learned of the raid, and watched it “horrified” on television.
Visibly upset, Richard told Mr Justice Mann that the BBC identifying him had smeared his name and reputation around the world. “The police did not do this to me. The BBC did this to me. I don’t think I’m ever going to get over it,” he said, breaking down in the witness box at the high court.
“The police had decided not to name me. And others felt they were above the law, the Leveson report and certainly way, way above the Magna Carta.”
The police raid and the publicity had cost him to date “£3.4m, excluding March” in lost business, and legal and PR bills, he said.
The high-profile dispute over privacy and the boundaries of press freedom revolves around how the BBC reported the investigation. The broadcaster, if it loses, is worried the case will set a far-reaching precedent that will restrict journalistic freedom of expression.
Gavin Millar QC, representing the BBC, has told the judge that the BBC’s reporting of the police raid “was accurate and in good faith, was on a matter of legitimate public interest and respected the rights of [Richard] as a suspect, in particular the presumption of innocence”.
Taking the stand, Richard was asked by his barrister, Justin Rushbrooke QC, if he was content to be called “Sir Cliff”. “Absolutely, yes, I prefer it to mister,” he replied, before being taken through his witness statement.
In his statement, the singer said when the manager of his Sunningdale flat called to tell him police were at the door with a warrant, he told him to let them in because, though “shaken” he assumed it a mistake, “as I knew I had done nothing wrong”.
But watching the BBC coverage from Portugal, “I could see the police going through the drawers in one of the rooms. I felt confused, disturbed and very upset. It was like watching burglars in my apartment going through my personal belongings.”
Shortly after, as things hit home, he said he collapsed. “I was just in despair, and felt hopeless and helpless. I felt as though I was in a hole with no means of getting out, and I was on my knees in the kitchen, sobbing. At that moment I couldn’t see how I could face the future, my friends or family.
“Although I knew I had done nothing wrong it felt like the whole world – everyone who knew me, everywhere I had been – must believe that I had, or at least was talking about whether I had done it or not.”
Richard said he resorted to using sleeping pills, felt “tormented” and his health suffered “both mentally and physically” as it took 22 months until he was informed no action would be taken against him. “I actually thought I was going to have a heart attack or a stroke.”
One individual tried to blackmail him, he said, threatening to “peddle further [false] allegations about me to the press”. “It felt like torture, sustained over a period of almost two years.”
The singer said he pulled out of charity events, pulled his autobiography, and even pulled out of his Wimbledon tennis commitments, and was unable to play tennis.
Richard, who has homes in Portugal and Barbados, said he had not been back to the Berkshire flat, except to pack up his possessions, saying it now felt “contaminated”.
“Unfortunately, I fear that to some extent my standing and my self esteem have been damaged forever,” he said in his statement. The BBC’s refusal to apologise had “hurt” him and he was “flabbergasted” when the corporation submitted the footage for an industry award, when they had treated him with “such contempt”.
“When all is said and done I am left with the overwhelming feeling that what the BBC did to me was very wrong. I was portrayed as a sexual offender around the world before I had even been questioned by police.”
Cross-examined by Millar, Richard, who struggled to hear at times, said he had been forced to spend money on legal bills because of the “vile” and “serious” nature of the allegation.
He disagreed with Millar’s suggestion that he would have had to disclose to people in business that he was the subject of police investigation, even if the BBC had not named him. “The BBC presentation changed everything for me. If the police had been investigating me and not naming me I would not have had anything to deal with unless I was charged.”
Lawyers have told Mr Justice Mann how, in late 2013, a man made an allegation to the Metropolitan police, saying he had been sexually assaulted in 1985 by Richard as a child during an event featuring evangelist Billy Graham at Sheffield United’s Bramall Lane football stadium.
Metropolitan police officers passed the allegation to South Yorkshire police in July 2014. Richard denied the allegation and, in June 2016, prosecutors announced that he would face no charges.
South Yorkshire police had issued a public apology to the singer and paid £400,000 damages and £300,000 in legal costs.
Richard is claiming £279,261 for legal fees and £108,500 for his PR expenses in the aftermath of the live broadcast. His compensation claim has been brought on the basis that the news reports violated his privacy and breached the 1998 Data Protection Act.
Rushbrooke said the singer had been subjected to privacy invasion “of a kind no citizen of this country should ever have to experience”. The impact had shattered Richard’s life and “his reputation around the world was left in shreds”. The coverage was all about the BBC’s obsessive hunt for a media scoop rather than reporting the news, he told the court.
The hearing continues.Finding Time To Garden In Your Busy LIfe
If you are environmentally conscious and worried about the toxic effects of chemicals, organic gardening may be for you. Organic gardeners eschew the harsh chemicals and fertilizers used by large corporate farms. Another benefit is that organic gardening techniques are often cost little-to-nothing. Below are some great tips to assist you grow to be the organic gardener that you hope to be.
A great horticulture tip to use is to always select types of plants that are more likely to produce a high yield. A plant that is resistant to disease, or one that is tolerant of extreme weather, will deliver a higher yield.
Pull all the weeds in your garden. Weeds can take over a healthy garden faster than you think. You might want to think about using white vinegar to do this. The acid in white vinegar kills weeds. You may also be using plants that need that very same acid. A spray solution is much easier to apply than to rid your garden of weeds by hand.
You can use boiling water to get rid of weeds naturally. Any vessel of boiling water that you can carry safely can be used as an organic herbicide. Pour boiling water over the weeds to kill them, but make sure not to pour the water over any plants you don’t want to kill. Boiling water damages weed and plant roots, so be sure to avoid the plants you don’t want to eliminate.
There are natural materials, and you can also use other plants to help keep pests away from your garden. For example, slugs can be deterred by the presence of marigolds or onions. Wood ash, when used as mulch, can help keep insects away from trees and shrubs. Using methods like these eliminates the need for chemical pesticides, which can be harsh or even harmful.
You should get a wheelbarrow and a kneeling stool for garden work..
Working in your garden is an excellent way to relax yourself. There are a variety of ways to achieve a state of inner peace. Horticulture is easily one of the most relaxing and gratifying ways to spend your extra time. It is not prohibitively expensive, and has numerous benefits. The best return is the joy and tranquility you can get from growing your very own greenery.
Use common sense when watering your garden. You can save time by using soaker hoses when watering plants. By doing this, you won’t need to water your plants individually. Use a low water pressure to avoid damaging tender plants. It can water the plants for two hours so that you can do other things.
Vegetables get softer as the temperature goes up, so you could damage your vegetables if you pick them during the hottest hours. See to it that you cut their connection to the vine as opposed to twisting them, because twisting could hurt the plant.
When horticulture, it is critical to shield your knees as much as possible. Many people experience back pain and stiffness from bending over and working in the garden for extended amounts of time. If you kneel, you can easily work on your plants without placing stress on your back. Place a cushioning kneeling pad on the ground or wear knee pads to make kneeling more comfortable.
If you horticulture. Get a bandage that seals the cut properly.
Take your time when planting seeds. First, add moisture to the soil where you will be planting. Lay out your seeds, and make sure that they will have enough room to grow. Bury them three times as deep as the size of the seeds. Read the seed pack as some varieties shouldn’t be covered with soil because they require light to sprout..
Flower Beds
In your flower beds and garden, utilize a few inches of organic mulch. Not only will you be adding nutrients, but weeds will be less likely to grow and moisture will be retained more easily. It will also increase the visual appeal of the flower beds.
Regularity is the key to keeping your organic garden in order, don’t let your list of chores pile up. If your busy life prevents you from tending your garden every day, do small tasks to avoid having so much work when you do have some time. For example, while your canine is outside going to the toilet, take the time to pull out a few weeds.
Utilizing the advice provided in this article in your organic horticulture efforts will produce great results. You will quickly see your garden becoming more productive and healthy, while being free of toxins. As your garden starts to become more attuned with nature, you will also see it attracting more wildlife.

Earlier Event: April 19Forged Drop Point: Introduction to Bladesmithing (level II)
Later Event: April 20Learn to Spin YarnToday, our partners at LEI Register have announced the strategic relationship between LEI Register and Ubisecure’s RapidLEI. Our companies have a shared vision on making LEIs more accessible, faster to obtain, lower cost and to enable new company identity use cases. Press release is detailed below:
LEI Register and RapidLEI Announce Official Partnership
Streamlining Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) availability for organisations all over the globe
London, UK and Tallinn, Estonia. January 10, 2019 – LEI Register, a leader in the provision and management of Legal Entity Identifiers (LEIs), and RapidLEI, a fully accredited LEI issuer specialising in the automation of the LEI issuance process, today announced a partnership. LEI Register will offer LEIs issued by RapidLEI, to make the registration of LEIs faster and more accurate for their global customers.
Unlike any other global company identifiers, LEI is backed by the G20 and therefore has the momentum and support to overcome any hurdles associated with achieving mass global adoption for best practices and regulation.
LEI Register, established in 2018, and RapidLEI, established in 2018, have a shared mission to make LEIs more accessible to organisations all over the world, and to develop and promote new technology use cases where LEIs provide a ‘single verifiable corporate identifier’ function. The two relatively new companies in the LEI ecosystem concur that a combination of automation technology and excellent customer service is necessary to better serve the existing LEI market and to ensure the LEI extends into new technology use cases.
LEI Register is an official registration agent represented in 25 countries and has gained a significant share of the LEI implementation and distribution market. RapidLEI is a newly accredited LEI Issuer, or LOU (Local Operating Unit), and since launching in June 2018 has experienced the highest growth in the LEI issuance market, outpacing existing LEI issuers with a 600% quarter-on-quarter growth of its customer base.
The two companies have been cooperating with great success since RapidLEI launched. LEI Register is now registering almost 1000 LEIs per month and RapidLEI is the only LEI Issuer able to confirm the LEI application in minutes. RapidLEI’s automation technology also ensures greater levels of LEI accuracy.
Toomas Pavelson, CEO of LEI Register, said that both parties share the same vision. “We want to make LEI application easier. Simple application form, data-autofill, variety of payment solutions, digital signature, automatic data accuracy check – all this should make the process painless and done in a matter of minutes. This drives the price down for the applicant and makes LEIs more accessible.”
Paul Tourret, Corporate Development Director for RapidLEI, said “the RapidLEI founders have a long history of disrupting the transactional identity market by using automation and customer service to provide better availability, speed and experience. We saw this in the 2000s after founding SSL providers like GlobalSign and GeoTrust Europe, and now we see a similar opportunity to make LEIs as ubiquitous as SSL. To work alongside world-class partners like LEI Register will realise our shared goals and we look forward to a long and fruitful relationship for the benefit of LEI Register customers.”
LEIs are available from LEI Register at.

Evident doesn ‘ t matter if the coincidence was a celebration, trade pageant, corporate banquet, or fundraiser masterly are some evaluation tools that you should betoken using to balm fudge together each up business preferable than the last. Strategic Learning Through Evaluation
The virgin evaluation tools are age and your most recent memories. Before you freedom that space, hour the memories are still fresh, write them down. What execute you descry in your creativity over you oomph over the gone few hours. These are the moments that stand out the most for you. Certainty me, they will betoken uttermost. These memories you obtain are the first-rate of the pre-eminent and the worst of the worst. Those are the memories we nurse to retain shroud the most clarity. Keep your note book on hand and birth video these momentarily. Conceivably, if you have a Wise Phone, you matched untrue modulation recordings during the go of things that buying it your attention.

Steward hard to besides suggestion your insights to them about their services. Epitomize complete that your words are presented in a constructive and benevolent behaviour but don ‘ t miss this hour to engage the other service providers that helped you arrange the situation for your clients. Strategic Learning Through Evaluation
Strategic Learning Through Evaluation
you own your notes, you obtain the insights of the other service providers involved, you onus vitality native. Put implement aside and inspire a superexcellent night ‘ s rest because you ‘ re going to be busy again in the morning. The next evaluation task may be very tiring for you. When you wake up be sure to get a big cup of coffee and take a deep breath because you are about to contact the clients for their feedback. If the event was a trade show or market, the vendors are who you will need to contact for feedback. This is not always a difficult task but prepare yourself for some possibly negative comments. Don ‘ t take it personally, look at this as a learning process not a personal report card. Here are a couple of things to consider when taking this feedback:
How much involvement did the person giving feedback have in the planning or promotion of the event? The less involvement or interaction they have had, the more complaints they may have. This is true simply because they don ‘ t have as much information or as much vested interest. This may also be an indicator of the motives for participating so, possibly, they had expectations that couldn ‘ t be met by you or the event. However, that is not to discount the feedback of the people that have had less involvement. There is something to be learned from all sources of feedback. Some input you will set aside or conclude is not relevant but there should still be something left for you to take away.
Unfortunately, some people just like to complain. Again, don ‘ t take it personally. If the event was a trade show or market type and a vendor is being particularly negative simply acknowledge them and their concerns and thank them for their feedback. Then make note not to invite them back to future events. The truth is that there are many small and home based businesses offering jewellery, skin care, diet supplements, and other products and you can find another vendor that can be more positive and supportive in the way they choose to address their concerns with you. If it is a client that has hired you, again, acknowledge their concerns and try to work things out with them. Discuss the issues with them but also be sure to ask them what they liked. Hopefully, by ending the conversation with the positives you can help to redirect the overall emotion and perception of how the event went. If they choose to remain on the negatives you may need to evaluate your future working relationship with them.

1. Industry: Africa’s Laughing out Loud
Trevor Noah - perhaps the most famous African comedian right now - recently signed a five-year extension of his contract at “The Daily Show.” Noah’s one of the highest paid late-night show hosts on American television, but more notably has millions of millennial followers making him trendy or viral almost every day. So as with music, fashion, and movies, Africans are taking over the digital video market.
AOL Advertising estimates that, globally, 67 percent of consumers primarily watch videos on their smartphones, 50 percent are finding videos primarily through social media feeds, and the majority (45%) are mainly drawn to videos no longer than 5 minutes. Tremendous news for comedians AphricanApe and Basketmouth, who boasts 455,000 and 3.8 million Instagram/Facebook followers, respectively. Marketers and entertainment executives alike might want to investigate how to grab the most ROI from this $31 billion business.
“African comedy is fresh and organic…” --BBC, “'Mo' problems, mo' jokes' - meet Africa's best comedians.”
"With the talent that you see coming up on the stage every day, in the next five years you might be sure, it's a matter of time before you see a Chris Rock or a Steve Harvey coming from the academy and that would be the dream.” --CNN, “Comedy Gold: Who are the funniest people in Africa?”
“[T]o have reached this stage 15, 16 years down the line, where we’re able to criticize openly like this, it’s a huge step forward in a democracy.” --NY Times, “Black Comedians in South Africa Put Power in the Punch Lines.”

2. Research: War vs. Peace
The United Nations General Assembly convened last week under the theme “Focusing on People: Striving for Peace and a Decent Life for All on a Sustainable Planet.” The focus of the press and attendees, though, soon turned to President Donald Trump’s threat of annihilating North Korea. While Americans imagine a nuclear conflict is on the horizon, war has been a reality in many African nations. South Sudan, Somalia and the Democratic Republic of Congo are just three examples of the dizzying effects of constant violence, including detrimental impacts on these countries’ bottom line.

Dental implants are man-made tooth roots (usually made of titanium) that are used to create a steady foundation for attractive and functional replacement teeth.
To replace a missing tooth, the implant post is first placed in the jawbone at the location of the missing tooth. During a period of healing, the implant and the jawbone fuse together in a process known as osseointegration. Our experienced dentist will then attach a dental implant restoration to the top of the dental implant post to complete the treatment and fully restore your smile. The type of dental implant restoration depends on how many teeth are missing and on your personal needs and preferences. Dental crowns are very common implant restorations, and dental bridges and dentures can also be used in conjunction with dental implants.
Dental implants can restore your smile’s:
- Function
- Health
- Beauty
- Strength
At Downtown Dental Associates, Dr. BJ Showman will help you create an implant treatment plan during your full assessment consultation. When your dental implant is complete, you can enjoy a stronger, healthier, and more beautiful smile. Please call us at 216-241-4303 today to learn how dental implants in Cleveland, Ohio, can change your life!Who is she?
My name is Miranda Wildman..
My paintings are intuitive representations of the vibrant dream scenes from my own sleep and awake state. Bold colors & shapes, symbols, fantasy dwellings and other worldly, ancestral landscapes find their way into my work regularly, where sometimes just playing with paint and color is what I fancy. I use a combination of layering acrylic paint, paper, and cyanotype. Cyanotype is a photographic process that employs the Sun’s rays. My intention for you the viewer, when you see my art, is to experience a sensory and joyful journey through my pieces and treat yourself with a little mystery on the way.
In my atmospheric vignettes I gather vintage lace & linens, my own cyanotype fabrics, fabrics designed using my paintings, interesting lighting, and interactive, artful seating. My installations lend well to photo shoots, tarot readings and intimate gatherings. I share some of my atmospheric styling secrets at my workshops and retreats. I would be honored if you'd join me for an artful event!
So, you want to know how I became an artist?
I live and create in the Western North Carolina mountains. I grew up in Vermont as a single child until the age of 10 when I gained four brothers through the marriage of my mother and father to my step father and stepmother. Whoa! After one year of art school at Portland school of art that I couldn’t attend a second year because of financial reasons, I basically flunked out of a state college due to lack of inspiration. With that blunder which caused confusion in my head about what to do next, I moved thankfully with my parents to North Carolina in 1996 and found my way making money to pay the bills at an awesome restaurant called La Caterina where I met and worked with people near and dear to me. I met my future husband living in the same apartment building and we decided to open up Plumbing contracting business where I would do the book work so we could be self-employed. We had that self-employed dream! We decided to work on the dream of my husband’s for five years and then we’d start to focus on my dream. Although I didn’t know what that dream was, I knew it had to do with MAKING ART EVERYDAY…I learned and loved a whole lot in the 10 years I worked with LEAF festival where I collaborated with an incredible team of creatives and folks who have a passion for spreading good cheer with art and music from around the world. My own passion for art installation was born festooning the grand spaces on the grounds of the festival. Fast forward to 2017 after 14 years of working closely with my husband as the founding partner for a plumbing company, my dream had come to fruition. I had made the transition over the course of almost a year and a half to becoming a full-time artist. I am beyond grateful to presently have an ever-growing community in which I may collaborate and share ideas with plus a wonderful home studio. I’ve been loving traveling a bit making art wherever I go, and look forward to planning some artful trips in 2019. I also am thankful to be able to offer art workshops at Studio 141 at the Hatchery in the River Arts District in Asheville.Find the right car rental in Tucson

FedEx ranks No. 2 on the Transport Topics Top 100 list of the largest North American for-hire carriers.
The discoveries added to the widening fears of more strikes like those that have already killed two people and wounded four in the last few weeks.
Hours after the latest blast, southwest of Austin. A worker was treated for minor injuries and released, police said.
“It would be silly for us not to admit that we suspect it’s related” to the other four Austin bombings since March 2, Lee said. She did not have details about the size, weight or description of the package.
The package was on a conveyer belt when it detonated. One worker reported ringing in her ears. She was treated and released from a hospital.
Before it exploded, the package had been sent from Austin and was addressed to a home in Austin, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton told Austin television station KXAN.
Investigators also closed off an Austin-area FedEx store where they believe the two package bombs were sent to the distribution center. Authorities roped off a large area around the shopping center in the enclave of Sunset Valley.
The FedEx blast came less than two days after another bombing wounded two men the night of March 18 March 18, saying only that they are in their 20s and white. But William Grote told The Associated Press on March 19 that his grandson was one of them and that he had what appeared to be nails embedded in his knees.
Police described the men’s injuries as significant, and both remained hospitalized March 19 in stable condition..
“It’s creepy,” said Erin Mays, 33. “I’m not a scared person, but this feels very next-door-neighbor kind of stuff.”

It comes as the Indian government gears up to spend as much as US$580 million across 20 cities chosen under the smart cities programme set up by Narendra Modi, the prime minister.
It marks the first phase of a plan to develop 100 cities into so-called smart cities by 2020.
SmartCity Kochi, a joint venture between Dubai Holding’s Tecom Investments and the government of Kerala, inaugurated its first phase, which includes a 650,000 square foot IT tower.
The project has had a series of setbacks since it was proposed more than a decade ago, including opposition, land disputes and red tape.
“This is a very important milestone for the United Arab Emirates government and for Dubai Holding,” said Mohammad Al Gergawi, the UAE’s Minister Of Cabinet Affairs and the chairman of Dubai Holding, speaking at a ceremony yesterday in Kochi, which was attended by Indian state and central government politicians.
“India is the UAE’s largest trading partner and the UAE is India’s third-largest trading partner,” said Mr Al Gergawi, explaining the importance of the historic and present day bonds between India and the UAE and Kerala in particular.
Indians from Kerala account for the largest group of expats in the UAE of any state in India, he said.
The design of SmartCity Kochi is based on the Dubai Internet City and Dubai Media City developments. Dubai Holding hopes to tap India’s burgeoning IT sector.
SmartCity Kochi is expected to employ 90,000 people by 2020, who might otherwise have travelled to other parts of India, Europe or the Gulf region for work opportunities.
Rajiv Pratap Rudy, India’s minister of skill development and entrepreneurship, said: “India is a huge country and the government of India, the prime minister, has launched the smart cities project. Kochi figures in that shortlisting and such projects across the country will build up a network, which will not only facilitate what we are doing within the country, but it will also facilitate our linkage internationally.”
Yusuff Ali, the managing director of the UAE-based LuLu Group, who is from Kerala, played an important role as a special invitee to the board of SmartCity in helping the project come to fruition.
The launch of the project follows the Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed’s visit to India this month, Mr Ali said, adding that the UAE was “happy” with the launch of the project and that the UAE “will do more projects like this in other [Indian] states, more IT parks”.
SmartCity Kochi “is a hub that IT companies from all over the world can come to”, Mr Ali said.
An educated workforce in Kerala was “sufficiently available”, he said.
Kerala has the highest literacy rate of any state in India.
When asked about the obstacles that SmartCity Kochi faced, Mr Ali said: “Initially any project will have challenges because there are a lot of rules and regulations. The Kerela government was very helpful and the Dubai government was patient.”
Oommen Chandy, the chief minister of Kerala, said that with SmartCity Kochi, a centuries-old relationship between Kerala and Dubai had “become even more deep and strong”.
The development would not only have a positive effect on Kochi’s economy, but the entire economy of the state of Kerala.
Twenty-seven companies are signed up to have operations in the first IT tower of the project, some of which have started fit-out work on their offices. They are expected to start operating out of those offices within three to four months.
The president of India, Pranab Mukherjee, in a written statement described the launch of SmartCity Kochi “as yet another milestone in the glorious relationship between the United Arab Emirates and India”.
He said that the project would help put Kochi and Kerala “on the map as a much sought after destination for knowledge industries”.
The developers announced yesterday that work on the second phase of SmartCity Kochi was also being launched and that it was expected to be completed within three years.

and severe flu complications are most common in children under 2 years of age*
Almost 1 in 4 children hospitalized with
the flu were aged 6 to 23 months during
the 2012-2013 flu season†
FLUAD Pediatric® will not treat influenza or its complications, including influenza-related hospitalizations, and does not protect against the common cold.
Vaccination is a way to help protect
your child from the flu
Flu vaccines work by causing the body to produce antibodies against the virus. This means that when your child is exposed to the flu virus, your child’s body is able to defend itself. The antibodies stop the attacking virus.
However, because of their young age, the antibody response to vaccines is reduced compared with older children.
*FLUAD Pediatric® is indicated in children 6 months to less than 2 years of age.
†According to the Immunization Monitoring Program Active (IMPACT) network.
Choose to protect your child with
FLUAD Pediatric®
FLUAD Pediatric® provides active immunization to children 6 months to less than 2 years of age, and is used to prevent children from developing the flu or to reduce flu symptoms.
A vaccine specifically designed
for children aged 6 to 23 months
In addition to inactivated flu particles, which correspond to the circulating flu viruses, FLUAD Pediatric® contains a helper agent called an adjuvant that enhances the body’s immune response to the vaccine.
The most common side effects of FLUAD Pediatric® are:
Side effects normally disappear without treatment after a day or two. Allergic reactions may occur.
FLUAD Pediatric® should not be used in children:
As with any vaccine, FLUAD Pediatric® may not protect 100% of individuals against the flu. If Guillain-Barré syndrome has occurred within six weeks of previous influenza vaccination, the decision to give FLUAD Pediatric® should be based on careful consideration of the potential benefits and risks.

E. (South Carolina United Turtle Enthusiasts) turtle nest protection teams. Jeff quickly responded to the stranding and, after making the official report to the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources (SCDNR), helped to gently load the emaciated loggerhead into the vehicle for Terry Graham and Debbie to transport to the South Carolina Aquarium.
Treatment
Once at the South Carolina Aquarium, this large adult female was transported on a cart and scale to the Animal Medical Facility on the first floor. It was here that veterinarian and sea turtle rescue program staff were able to get to work stabilizing this minimally responsive turtle. Named Magnolia after her stranding location, it was evident that this turtle had not been eating or moving for some time. She was emaciated, covered in barnacles, and made little effort to move, only to lift her head every few minutes to breath. Blood revealed anemia and low blood glucose, both of which are to be expected with a debilitated turtle. Fluids, vitamins, and antibiotics were all given, and vitals such as heart rate and papillary reflex were all routinely checked. After fluids were given slowly with an IV drip line, Magnolia was placed down in the Sea Turtle Hospital in a very shallow tank of salt water. Staff kept a very close eye on her throughout the day to make sure she was able to come up easily for air.
Updates
24 May 2016: After several days of supportive care and being held in extremely shallow water, Magnolia has now been moved to a filtered hospital tank! We are happy to report that her activity level has increased dramatically in just a week! She is now swimming around and actively searching for food. Staff is slowly increasing her diet and she is now being fed at 0.5% of her body weight. Due to her large size, this means she is already eating over a pound of food! It is definitely a rewarding experience to witness the early stages of her recovery.
7 June 2016: This big girl continues to slowly recover from severe emaciation. She is bright, alert and relatively active. With a current diet at 1.5 percent of her body weight, that’s a lot of food, folks! We’re currently administering calcium injections to treat bone decalcification caused by long-term malnutrition.
8 September 2016: Due to the hospital being at capacity, Magnolia was transferred to Ripley’s Aquarium in Myrtle Beach where they helped continue her recovery. She’s now set to be released tomorrow from Huntington Beach State Park.

Can you please tell me something about the combination of HR and Marketing? Many professionals are saying that the time has reached when HR and Marketing should be combined. If the company wants to achieve their goals, they have to work together. What do you think?
IMHO, marketing and human resources go together. When you think about the 4 P’s of marketing – price, place, promotion and product – it aligns with HR as compensation/benefits, work environment, career opportunities, and corporate culture. The common element, of course, is people.
I’ve written a few articles on the subject of marketing and human resources. You can check them out:
If Your Marketing Director Ran HR
Internal Talent Marketing
I also know several human resources pros who’ve had both HR and Marketing responsibilities. It’s a real testament to their business savvy and talents.
So I’m not opposed to the synergy of human resources and marketing. It does mean companies have to strategically plan their efforts. It also means that marketing pros will have to learn some of the technical aspects of HR and vice versa. Some of this synergy could be lost if the organization is too large and spreads resources too thin. Because a combined effort of human resources and marketing doesn’t necessarily mean a reduction in workforce or expense.
HR and Marketing, like all the other functions in a company, should be working together to achieve the company’s goals.
What do you think – are there some synergies to be realized between marketing and human resources?

Rochelle says
I would say that HR is already a form of marketing and the company success is dependent on the effective communication of many areas covered under the umbrella of HR. For example: Recruiting is Marketing 101 to candidates and the communications with your employees is internal marketing (i.e. carefully crafting the new benefit announcements to make the changes sound more palatable). Even the employee newsletter, which traditionally originates in HR for small companies is a marketing piece. In every company I’ve ever worked for I have been asked to write policy, procedure, and training content. All of these are internal marketing with a little legalese and disclaimers thrown in for good measure. When I implemented an LMS (learning management system), I immediately got our marketing team involved to ensure that the company message was communicated properly, that it was aligned with the company goals, that the actual design fit into our design scheme, and that the schedule had a communication plan.
Stéphane Olivier says
I think that HR and Marketing (and Corporate Communications) are going to interact more in the future.
There are at least two structural reasons for that.
One is the war for talent: companies that used to compete for clients are now going to fight for recruits. This means that an increasing percentage of their media budget will be used for recruitment campaigns. HR thus needs more marketing.
The other reason is social media: marketers are now considering that a company’s employee is a medium him/herself. They want employees to spread the good word about their products via Facebook, Twitter, or personal blogs. For this strategy to be effective, you need a strong company culture and happy employees. Marketing thus needs more HR…

Thanks for the comments. I think you both raise an interesting point about corporate communications being a common ground between HR and marketing.
Mary Wright says
Or a reduction in focus on the legal aspects of HR. Add legal to the last sentence. Great article, Sharon. I’ve been asking myself about this combo since my first Tweet. It seemed the vast majority of HR folk I found on Twitter were recruiters, and the lawyers who Tweet HR ignore (for the most part) recruiting and tech. Times are changing.

I also believe that, HR, Marketing and Communications would be used to ensure better employee satisfaction. Interdisciplinary approaches frequently contribute to good outcomes!
Happy New Year!

Tony Bennett says
As one of those who has held senior roles in both Marketing and Human Resources, I am very conscious of both the similarities and differences between the two areas.
They are about influencing and motivating two of the most important audiences in most companies – customers and employees (on occasions shareholders and potential investors can be pretty important as well!!).
Some skills are common to both but there are very different dynamics between the two which would make it very challenging for most companies to effectively merge them in the same function.
They are also both so important that it is questionable whether the structure of the company would be balanced if they were combined.
The nature of the company’s activity is central to determining the extent that Marketing and HR (and “Operations”) need to co-operate closely. A services company, for instance, where a high percentage of employees have direct contact with customers requires particularly close alignment.
The key to successful alignment of marketing and HR is clarity in both strategy and values – and effective communication of both throughout the organisation. Values are particularly important and effective if developed to capture the heart of the organisation. They become the long term inspiration and short term guidance to marketeers and employees alike.
Sharlyn Lauby says
I believe companies are starting to realize the role employees play in marketing the company. In part, due to the impact of social media.
Thanks everyone for keeping this great conversation going!
Andy Phillips says
HR in my view is an enabler for the marketing function – without people acting in a way that promotes the brand then much marketing is hot air and HR becomes mere nannying of performance. Does customer Xs experience with an employee match the brand values? How we ensure that happens is essentially HR. I wonder though whether HRDs would be happy reporting to the marketing Director?
Sharlyn Lauby says
Thanks for the comment. You raise an interesting question about HR reporting to Marketing. The reverse also applies. How many marketing directors would be happy with responsibility for human resources?
meher says
i’m marketing pro with responsibility of employer branding, but i must confess for me to be successful, my HR peers need to co-operate and contribute in executing my plans . I need to understand HR strategies and tactics as much as they need to understand marketking.
i agree with Stéphane Olivier, with war of talent getting more intense, HR can’t do without marketing help and vice versa. The employees being very important brand ambassadors and with advent of social media a channel that employees use very frequently to share their opinions, marketeers have realised it would be stupidity not leverage them as buzz machine to spread positive news in market for this they have to work with HR.
Recruiters are the new sales people, they need to concentrate on selling the company and job to candidates and for this they need marketing’s to help them as they help sales folks.
Hence employer Branding professional can be the new breed of marketeers with HR sensitivities. My specialisation in marketing as well as HR has real helped me function and perform in role.
Sharlyn Lauby says
Thanks for the comment. I can totally see a new kind of hybrid position that bridges both human resources and marketing. It will not only take the “marketer with HR sensitivities” but the HR pro with a great deal of business savvy.Sep 08, 2009

The widow of a British retiree murdered on his yacht on the Caribbean island of St Lucia fears that the four men accused of killing him may soon walk free after a series of mistakes by local police and prosecutors.
Roger Pratt, 63, was beaten until he suffered brain damage and then toppled over the side of his boat and left to drown in January 2014, during what was supposed to be a dream voyage across the world.
Four young St Lucian men were quickly arrested but now – nearly three years after the murder – the prosecution against them appears to be unravelling.
Prosecutors have told Margaret Pratt, Mr Pratt’s wife 62-year-old wife, that DNA evidence against the alleged killers had been contaminated and was no longer admissible in court.
Defence lawyers also plan to challenge confessions made by the suspects in the days after the murder, arguing that police did not give the young men access to lawyers and so the confessions are invalid.
Mrs Pratt, 62, told the Telegraph that she feared that without the confessions and the DNA evidence, the case against the four men will fall apart and no one will be held accountable for her husband’s murder.
“I will feel very let down if this all comes apart. After two and a half years you start to wonder what justice is,” she said. “I could give way and burst into tears now but that will not help.”
The Pratts’ journey to St Lucia began in June 2013 after the couple, who did not have children, left their home in Norwich and prepared to set sail on their yacht, Magnetic Attraction.
Mr Pratt, a senior engineer with Jaguar Land Rover, had retired in 2004 and his wife, an accountant, had stopped working in 2013.
They sailed from Britain to Netherlands and then down through France, Spain, Portugal and the Canaries before crossing the Atlantic, arriving in St Lucia for New Year celebrations.
But their journey together came to an end in a few moments of extraordinary violence on the night of January 17, 2014.
“We weren’t asleep and we heard a noise and we looked at each other. I remember saying to Roger: be careful,” Mrs Pratt said.
The couple looked out and saw at least three young men aboard their yacht after apparently rowing out in a small boat.
Mr Pratt told them to go away but the men set upon the couple and began beating both of them.
As Mr Pratt struggled with one man, two others held his wife and began rummaging through the couple’s possessions and took their laptop and Mrs Pratt’s handbag.
And then, as quickly as it started, the violence came to an abrupt end.
“Someone said something and all of a sudden everything stopped,” Mrs Pratt said. “They just dropped everything and they all jumped over the side and that was the moment I realised Roger was there.”
Mr Pratt, having already suffered injuries to his head, had fallen or been thrown overboard and left to drown.
A pathologist later gave the cause of death as “asphyxia secondary to blunt force trauma”.
The Royal St Lucia Police Force quickly arrested four young men – Richie Kern, Fanis Joseph, Jermoine Jones, and Kervin Devaux – and extracted confessions from them.
After lowering her husband’s standard from Magnetic Attraction for the last time, Mrs Pratt left the island in early 2014.
As the months passed, there were few updates from St Lucian authorities about progress in the case.
The island of just 180,000 people has one of the world’s highest murder rates and prosecutors are struggling to clear a massive backlog of cases.
Some defendants can spend five years in prison before their case finally reaches trial. St Lucia recently restored the death penalty for murder.
In May 2015, Mrs Pratt had a disturbing conversation with Victoria Charles-Clarke, the director of public prosecutions (DPP) in St Lucia.
The prosecutor told her that DNA evidence in the case had become contaminated and could not be used against the four suspects.
But she assured Mrs Pratt that prosecutors still had the confessions the four men had made and were confident of a conviction.
Mrs Charles-Clarke has since stepped down as DPP and did not respond to requests for comment.
The second pillar of the case appeared to begin crumbling this summer when Alberton Richelieu, one of the defence lawyers, challenged the validity of the confession given by his client Jermoine Jones.
None of the men had been assigned lawyers at the time they confessed and Mr Richelieu argued that was a violation of St Lucian law.
“Once you are charged with murder you must be assigned an attorney and informed of your right to have a lawyer before you are questioned. None of that was done,” Mr Richelieu said.
Both sides are now waiting for a judge to rule on the admissibility of the confessions.
The current director of public prosecutions, Stephen Brett, said he could not comment on the ongoing case.
Mr Brett has not spoken to Mrs Pratt about the case and she has received no other updates from prosecutors on the island. St Lucia’s Ministry of Home Affairs did not respond to a request for comment.
Even if the confessions are struck down by the court, the prosecution is believed to still have some forensic evidence from the scene, including a bite mark on one of the men that matches Mrs Pratt’s teeth.
But without the DNA and the confessions, a once straightforward case would appear to be in serious danger of collapsing.
The murder trial was due to start next month, but Mrs Pratt expects it will be pushed back until at least 2017.
“It was supposed to be an open and shut case and the government were all over it at the time and yet there basic errors of constitutional process followed by unforgivable lapses in the DNA evidence,” Mrs Pratt said.
“I’m left with the feeling that the government is just not able to upon to deliver a reliable system of justice either to its own population or to the many tourists who visit each year.
“My fear is that due to bungles in the process four accused people will walk free and I have had no explanation of what is happening. I’m fighting solo battles on this.”OOops... You seem to be lost!!

When Americ. Instead, the agency intends to hand over to the Afghan government the challenging task of installing a large hydropower turbine. Obama’s troop surge — is drawing unique scrutiny.

The wrecked vessel is believed to be the Queen of Sweden, a merchant ship of the Swedish East India Company which hit a rock off the headland of Knab while seeking shelter in Bressay Sound, Shetland on 12 January 1745. The remains lie close to Twageos Point, at the southern entrance to Lerwick Harbour.
Historic Environment Scotland (HES), who advise Scottish Government on the designation of historic MPAs, has recommended the Scottish Government recognise and protect this important part of Scotland’s marine heritage with HMPA status.
Historic MPAs aim to preserve marine historic assets of national importance, so they can be protected, valued and understood.
The wreck of Queen of Sweden is arguably the best preserved remains of a merchant sailing vessel of the Swedish East India Company located in waters around Scotland..”
The Drottningen af Swerige (Queen of Sweden) was the flagship of the Swedish East India Company, and the largest vessel in the company’s fleet. During the 18th century, the Swedish East India Company played an important role in growing northern European trade with China in tea and silk.
The vessel left Gothenburg on 9 January 1745, en route to Cadiz for more supplies before heading to China. However she quickly ran into trouble a few days later as the weather deteriorated. With poor visibility and under blizzard conditions, the ship struggled to maintain course, forcing the captain to head for the safety of Lerwick. With the safety of shore in sight, she struck a rock. Luckily all the crew made it to shore safely.

Dynamic changes in lens organophosphate metabolites during 24 hr incubation in 30 mM galactose media were measured with phosphorus-31 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The following phosphates were quantitated from the intact crystalline lens: adenosine triphosphate (ATP), adenosine diphosphate (ADP), inorganic orthophosphate, alpha-glycerophosphate, phosphorylated hexoses and trioses, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, uridine diphosphoglucose and uridine diphosphogalactose, glycerol-3-phosphorylethanolamine and 3-phosphorylcholine, and an unidentified phosphorus-containing molecule. The temporal sequences of metabolic events that define the dynamic rates of accumulation or depletion of lens organophosphates reveal that the first event in the decline of the tissue upon galactose incubation is a net consumption of ATP, which occurs as a sigmoidal function with time and which is typified by a characteristic half-life of 18 hr. Alpha-glycerophosphate accumulated at an increasing rate with time, whereas ADP, inorganic orthophosphate, and the other organophosphates were essentially unchanged. Cataract formation in the subcapsular and superficial cortical regions was visible after 16 hr incubation in the experimental buffer. These findings support the hypothesis that alterations in the organophosphate levels of the lens are contributing factors to the initial formation of the experimental galactose cataract.

Hear a 2-minute audio clip of Lucy Scott-Moncrieff talking to Verita’s Charlie de Montfort about our report on the governance arrangements in the paediatric haematology and oncology service at Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. This follows Myles Bradbury’s conviction in December 2014.
Lucy answers questions on who the report will impact the most, what the busy CEO needs to know about it and what improvements the NHS can make on the back off its publication.
Below is a snippet from the investigation and report commissioned for Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust:
“Dr Myles Bradbury was employed as a paediatric haematologist in the paediatric haematology and oncology service at Cambridge University Hospitals (CUH) NHS Foundation Trust (the trust). In November 2013, the family of a patient raised a concern about possible inappropriate behaviour by Dr Bradbury. Senior staff were alerted at once. He was immediately removed from clinical duties, then excluded from clinical duty the following day, and did not return to the trust. Following investigations by the police, Dr Bradbury was formally charged in July 2014 with 11 offences against children under his care. Following further investigation, he pleaded guilty in September 2014 to 25 sexual offences against 18 children who had been his patients, as well as to charges of voyeurism and possession of indecent images. He was sentenced to a total of 22 years’ imprisonment, with the judge emphasising the seriousness of the breach of trust that these offences displayed.”

Persuasive, targeted and creative copy is what a marketing copywriter has to come up with on each job…
Marketing copywriting needs to sell or initiate action which can be anything from signing up to a newsletter, requesting a quote or claiming a prize.
And in order to persuade the audience to go from passive to active, you’ve got to grab their attention using powerful, benefit driven headlines and engaging content that tells a story and motivates them to take action.
Your marketing copy needs to be original to make you stand out from the crowd.
Coming up with something original is challenging and that’s where your USP (Unique Selling Proposition) comes into play. It’s an important part of your marketing copy and as soon as you’ve nailed it, your USP needs to feature prominently in all your marketing collateral because it’s your point of difference over the competition.
Your USP plus other benefits of your product or service is what makes a potential customer call your hotline, complete your contact form or send an email, rather than leapfrog to the competition.

In an attempt to explore the notion “ideas that are free spread faster”, the marketing author Seth Grodin asked his publisher to give away his book “Unleashing The Ideas Virus” for free. When they refused Seth decided to post the book online. On the first day it was downloaded 3,000 times, the next day 6,000 times, and so on until it reached 3 million downloads. He then began to receive emails from people who didn’t want to read the book on a screen, so he printed a 200 page hard back version and began selling it for $40 a copy. It became a worldwide bestseller and within a month the book, which he had initially given away for free, had made more money than any of his previous books combined. But this wasn’t about the money. The point he was making was that the process by which he had sold his book was an indication that everything had changed. “The industry, as we know it, is dead,” he says, “There has never been a better time to be an artist.”

By Mike Gibson
EB-5 loans are often undertaken as subordinate loans. When in a subordinate position, an EB-5 lender should always consider whether it would be beneficial to request an intercreditor agreement from the senior lender in the transaction. If a lender’s and borrower’s negotiating power permits it, an intercreditor agreement could be a critical component in protecting the lender’s ability to repay EB-5 investors in a distressed project situation.
If the parties negotiating power does not support it, an intercreditor agreement can simply further erode a lender’s rights without any real benefits. Given that an intercreditor agreement can be a double-edged sword, a key early decision in a transaction is whether to require an intercreditor agreement as a lender, if one is not imposed by a senior lender in a transaction.
Identifying the Different Types of Loans
Before diving into the details of an intercreditor agreement, its important to understand the difference between a senior loan and a junior, mezzanine and subordinate loans, as these terms are often used interchangeably.
A senior loan is a loan secured in the first and highest priority position by collateral of the borrower, in the EB-5 context, the collateral is often real estate.
A junior loan is a loan secured by the same collateral as the senior loan but in a second or other junior position. A mezzanine loan is secured by a pledge of the ownership interests, like membership or partnership interests, of the real estate owner. The borrower is holder of such ownership interests and not the real property owner.
A subordinate loan, whether a junior loan or mezzanine loan, is secondary to the rights of the senior lender on a project. The key rights that could be subordinate are the right to realize on or sell any collateral held by the subordinate lienholder or the right to payment under the subordinate loan.
Each definition of the loans may have a nuance or altered meaning based on the specific terms and conditions of a transaction, however, the use of these terms means something to the average person that operates in the financial world and consistent use of these terms can avoid confusion regarding how a transaction is actually structured. In any of these structures, an intercreditor agreement should be considered by an EB-5 lender.
Key Points to Consider in a Negotiation
If you can obtain a reasonable intercreditor agreement, there are certain key points that every EB-5 lender should consider in that negotiation, which mostly relate to preserving control or economic rights over a project as long as possible. The key points in an intercreditor agreement for a subordinate lender are to preserve the ability to foreclose on collateral for the subordinate loan, preserve the ability to receive debt service payments, obtain the right to take over a defaulted project and complete construction and development, preserve recourse against guarantors and obtain the ability to purchase a senior loan if an event of default occurs.
Other key points include the ability to approve modifications of senior debt, in particular adverse changes in economic terms of the senior loan, and to have a standstill on the exercise of senior lender’s remedy of foreclosure for a limited period of time.
An additional benefit of being in a subordinate position is that the senior lender often will have the administrative infrastructure to monitor loan draws and the progress of construction of the project, thereby reducing the cost of the loan to the subordinate lender.
Even though intercreditor agreements are beneficial, not all key points will be achieved in every negotiation. There are some items that a subordinate lender might have to give up in an intercreditor agreement.
A subordinate lender will often be asked to give up the right to foreclose on subordinate collateral unless timely exercised, the right to repayment of subordinate debt if subordinate lender is unwilling or unable to cure defaults related to the project, the right to make independent decisions in a bankruptcy of the borrower, the right to pursue remedies against guarantors that are common guarantors with senior lender, the right to modify subordinate loan documents and the confirmation that EB-5 funds will be disbursed prior to senior loan funds.
So many rights of a subordinate lender are lost and key rights of the subordinate lender must be promptly and properly exercised or a borrower’s default can result in a total loss of an EB-5 investment in a project.
When an Agreement may be Beneficial
An intercreditor agreement can often take more than it can give a subordinate lender. Given that, unless the EB-5 lender or borrower have leverage to obtain a reasonable, arms-length negotiation of an intercreditor agreement, a subordinate lender will often be better suited to close a loan transaction without an intercreditor agreement. An EB-5 lender will have leverage in a transaction when its funds are critical to completion of a project or the lender has the independent economic means to complete a project.
A borrower will have leverage when it has a good, long-standing relationship with a senior lender or the ability to replace a senior lender with another party. A subordinate lender should consider these factors prior to even requesting an intercreditor agreement and after careful consideration, it could be a rational decision to proceed with a loan without requesting such an agreement.
The EB-5 loan has long conjured up an image of a covenant and compliance light loan structure on interest rate terms that are significantly more favorable than could otherwise be found in the marketplace for similar loans. The appeal to borrowers of such loans is understandable. However, the question was whether the regional center lenders and EB-5 investors were being properly protected in the prevailing EB-5 loan structures and documentation.
The evolution of EB-5 loans to more market loan structures and documentation terms is essential to the continued growth and viability of the EB-5 industry. Intercreditor agreements are a key part of that evolution. EB-5 investors are demanding loans and transactions that are structured on market terms and with market protections for their investment. Transactions that are structured solely as borrower-friendly vehicles without market protections for the EB-5 lenders and investors, will likely never find the investors needed to utilize EB-5 capital in a project.
EB-5 investors should not view intercreditor agreements as a requirement to a solidly structured EB-5 subordinate loan transaction but they absolutely should consider whether such an intercreditor agreement can be obtained on favorable terms in a subordinate loan structure.

"We booked this cottage for 2 reasons, 1) dark skies so we could see stars without light pollution, we got clear cold nights but also a full moon, so we could only see the stars that we would see back at home. 2) to have time away due to bonfire night, as our dog got very stressed last year at home, we got our wish and very chilled and relaxed dog. About the cottage.....WOW you get a lot of cottage for your money, particularly in off season, loads of internal space, photos don't do it justice and deceptive from front, if you are taking dog(s) there are safe areas for them front and back, back is preferred as you can see through several windows. Cast log stove makes lounge nice and cosy, watching flames dance with no lights on and a lovely moon rise in the old arch window, was a joy for me....but lost on the hound. Kitchen, plenty of space and enough utensils and cookware (take a water filter if you have one) water is from a bore hole, but tea is nicer having had water filtered. Bathroom, big, nice deep bath and separate shower.....but its the only one, if you have family of four, you may struggle at times. The area, well you got a forest on your doorstep, 2 rivers (1 front, 1 back) Kielder water not far away, Hadrian's wall (I recommend locating a place called the SILL) its a new education centre, great for kids. Hexham is nearest major town, lovely buildings, and shops a good park with skate park, nearest village is Bellingham, which has food shops, tea rooms, heritage centre with a railway carriage, a waterfall walk.....its a cracking area for those muddy walks and wide open spaces, my only gripe is dog and animals, the place is full of either sheep or cattle.....so no suitable places to let dog off lead, same with cottage area, only safe space to play is your rear enclosed garden, everywhere else has to be on lead. But apart from that I cannot recommend this cottage enough, for a autumn/winter hide away it's perfect."

"My wife and I very much enjoyed the peace and quiet and picturesque remoteness of S84096, being some three miles from the main road from Kielder to Bellingham, which in itself bears no comparison whatsoever to the volumes of traffic one experiences nearer to more densely populated areas. The owner, Simon, lives next door in Bower House and was very friendly and helpful and not at all intrusive. The welcome pack of scones, tea & coffee, milk and butter, not forgetting the bottle of wine, was an unexpected and pleasant surprise. Accommodation was very clean and comfortable and fully equipped as we all expect nowadays. Admittedly the weather was superb for our stay, but even if it had been not so good then we would have still enjoyed our stay and may even have used the TV and vast array of games and books available. There is plenty to see and do in the area, one week was not enough! We certainly recommend S84096 to those wanting a relaxing and peaceful holiday away from the "madding crowd"."

"This is an amazing lodge with lots of features and gadgets. The views are lovely during the day and even better at night with clear skies.The lodge is extremely spacious and has everything you need and more. Lodges were well spread out and very private, we didn't hear a thing .The only reason we haven't given 10 is there was a smell of drains in the main bedroom and the bedroom lights flickered on and off randomly during the night.The booking form does warn you the hot tub may not be ready for use on the first night and it wasn't. This is the first time we've experienced this.We had a take away one night and the food was lovely, plenty of it and reasonable price. The odd negative we have put were reported so hopefully they'll be put right. There is an activity centre a few minutes drive away that has a pub which serves lovely food and a small shop that sells essentials. We would definitely recommend this lodge and hopefully will return in the future."

"This was our first holiday in a holiday cottage and Gallow Law has certainly set the bar high. Such a lovely cottage with plenty of room for the whole family. Very cosy and has everything you could need. It was lovely to arrive to a welcome package of scones, butter, bread, milk, wine and dog biscuits. The owner, Simon also brought round some freshly laid eggs which is just what we needed for our morning fry up. It’s such a peaceful location with lovely walks from the doorstep and not far from Kielder which is worth a visit. It was very helpful to have walking routes on the bookcase and plenty of information on places to visit. Thank you for a lovely stay, we were sad to be leaving but will definitely be back!"

"Absolutely amazing cottage, the minute you walk through the door it is welcoming, we were very surprised how big it is the pictures don't reflect the true size of the rooms. Every thing has been thought of by the owners to a very high standard, good beds and high quality bed linen always a plus in my book.The welcome gifts of eggs, bread, milk, butter, scones and wine were very much appreciated and a nice touch. Ii is quite remote but that was just what we needed some peace and quiet with beautiful views, the stars are amazing. We will be back."Judith Faye Esther was born February 28, 1944 to the late Bernard Esther and Dorothy Esther in Grand Rapids, MI. She received her wings September 9, 2018.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s son, Yair, took to Twitter to accuse Turkey of being guilty of committing the Armenian Genocide, after a day of tit-for-tat exchanges between government officials in both countries.
“I will remind him [President of Turkey Erdogan] about the Genocide committed against Greeks, Kurds, and the Armenians. They committed ethnic cleansing, expelling the whole Christian population from Asia Minor,” Yair tweeted, adding also that the current day Istanbul was Constantinople, capital city of the Byzantine Empire and the center of Orthodox Church for more 100 years before the Turkish occupation .

The 34-year-old singer called for an end to “these robberies of lives,” in an impassioned plea posted on her Web site.
Beyoncé has made political statements before over police shootings of young African-American men. But she limited her feelings to her music.
Earlier this year, her song “Formation” and her Super Bowl 50 halftime performance drew criticism on social media. Some interpreted them as anti-police.
The lemonade singer made no apologies. “It makes me proud,” Beyonce said of the performance in an interview afterward with Entertainment Tonight.
She acknowledged that “Formation” was not just another song. “I wanted people to feel proud, and have love for themselves,” she said. Fans called the song a “celebration of blackness.”
But the Sterling and Castile shootings highlighted just how much of a racial divide still exists in this country.
Castile was a popular Falcon Heights, Minnesota public school cafeteria worker. A police officer shot him four times during a routine traffic stop. His girlfriend live streamed the incident on Facebook as he lay dying.
Castile had informed the officer he was licensed to carry a gun and had one in the car. When he explained he was reaching for his wallet, the officer opened fire. The death has been ruled a homicide.
Two officers shot Sterling six times in Baton Rouge, LA. He was pinned to the ground at the time. The FBI and the U.S. Justice Department are investigating the incident. Sterling was selling CDs in front of a convenience store.
He reportedly was carrying a gun, but appeared to be under control in videos of the incident shot by witnesses.
Beyoncé lends an influential voice to the controversies. She has a large fan base and is highly regarded. She wrote that she was “sick and tired” of young men and women of color being shot and killed by police.
“These robberies of lives make us feel helpless and hopeless but we have to believe that we are fighting for the rights of the next generation, for the next young men and women who believe in good,” she wrote in the open letter.
She went to lengths to say she was only calling out officers who “fails to value life” and “believes that murder or any violent action by those who are sworn to protect us should consistently go unpunished.”
Beyonce asked her fans to contact their local representatives to demand changes. The singer has 14.5 million Twitter followers.

Abstract
This thesis examines the way genocide leaves marks in the writings of targeted people. It posits not only that these marks exist, but also that they indicate a type of psychological resistance. By focusing on the ways Holocaust diarists depicted Nazi perpetrators, and by concentrating on the ways language was used to distance the victim from the perpetrator, it is possible to see how Jewish diarists were engaged in alternate and subtle, but nevertheless important, forms of resistance to genocide. The thesis suggest this resistance on the part of victims is similar in many ways to well-known distancing mechanisms employed by perpetrators and that this evidence points to a “crisis of imagination” – for victims and perpetrators alike – in which the capability to envision negation and death, and to identify with the “Other” is detrimental to self-preservation.

Post to TumblrOne might say that the idea that food is raison d’etre is debatable. But in fact, it is not. Food is just too good. Which is why most so-called "diets" offend me. When it comes to short term, difficult-to-sustain daily meal plans that simultaneously suck all the enjoyment from my life, in most cases, I'd rather pass. (Doctor-ordered diets must be exempted here.) But the diet I'm here to tell you about changed my mind. Because it’s not about cutting out good foods/life's simple pleasures. It’s about adding others in to enhance thy beauty and sustain thy youthful glow: this is the hyaluronic acid diet, and it is both delicious and life extending. I have a theory that these secondary factors contribute to its effectiveness, but we can talk about that some other time.
You’ve heard of hyaluronic acid. It's possible you even read about it here. If you haven’t, do, but for now: know that it’s an ingredient naturally produced in the body that’s also used in moisturizers, anti-aging products, and as a joint pain reducer. Hyaluronic acid has tried and true results—as shown in this study—and it is not only produced by and for your own body, but a pretty wide variety of foods contain it, too. Luckily, those foods all have something in common. That is the simple fact that they are—surprise!—actually satiating. If you try just one diet in your life, let it be this one. Here is to a longer, more beautiful, more fulfilling life. The list is here:
Potatoes
Thanks to McDonald's, probably, potatoes tend to get a bad rap. But back in the ‘80s, Connie Chung and ABC gave us “The Miracle of Hyaluronic Acid,” a ten-minute feature profiling the long life expectancy and low disease rates of a small village in Japan called Yuzuri-Hara. According to a researcher there, the constant—apart from relevant factors such as little to no pollution and a low-stress lifestyle—was believed to be the diet, which was full of one unique ingredient: potatoes. Despite the video’s dated overtones and Chung’s pronunciation of “hyaluronic,” it does ring true to some extent—potatoes are full of hyaluronic acid. And while yes, they are starchy, they’re also high in vitamin c, potassium, fiber, magnesium, and antioxidants. Also, they're really good roasted with EVOO, garlic and parsley. Just ask Ina Garten.
Sweet potatoes
Same but different. Here is one reason to order the sweet potato fries with chili oil next time you're at Ruby's. The other is that they are delicious.
Kale
Yes, kale has been known as the darling of Whole 30 and other Instagram diets all over the world. But let's not be reductive. It is so much more than that. High in protein, fiber, and a number of brain-enhancing vitamins, it's no wonder it qualifies as a “superfood.” As such, the fact that it makes this list doesn’t come as a surprise—hyaluronic acid is on its long list of beneficial nutrients. But have you ever massaged kale with olive oil and lemon juice and salt and pepper to be eaten as a quick and easy meal? You should.
Red Wine
I have two pieces of excellent news: the first is this.
Dark Chocolate
The second is this.
Red meats
So often the bad guy. I am a vegetarian, actually, so the fact that I'm writing this makes me feel hypocritical on multiple levels. (And yes, I do recognize that vegetarianism might be called dieting on some level. I have nothing to say for myself.) But facts are facts and the fact of the matter at hand is that "organ meats" are rich in hyaluronic acid and that's what this diet is about! Might as well balance the over-caffeination in your body with a nice burger at lunch today.
Almonds
Not only are almonds high in protein, fiber, healthy fats, potassium, calcium, and vitamin E, but on top of all that, their hyaluronic acid content can make a visible difference in your skin. Same goes for cashews. Stock up on your nut butters. Almond butter and jelly sandwiches?!
Citrus fruits
Orange, grapefruit, lemon, lime, clementine—sweet, juicy, excellent sources fiber, vitamin C, and hyaluronic acid. Fight infection, satisfy sugar cravings and plump skin all at once.
Bone broth
Would I still be able to call myself a vegetarian if I adopted slurping bone broth on a daily basis? Probably not. Nevertheless this is going to be one of your best sources of hyaluronic acid in food. Let me know how it goes for you. I'll make up for it with red wine, ounce for ounce.

The meeting with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He would cap the latest round of talks in Washington, with Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer leading the U.S. delegation. Plans for a meeting between Trump and Liu signal optimism that talks are making sufficient progress to warrant another face-to-face meeting between the two men.
As the discussions continued Thursday, reports emerged that negotiators are working on memorandums of understanding that would form the basis of a final deal. The MoUs would cover areas including agriculture, non-tariff barriers, services, technology transfer and intellectual property, according to a person briefed on the talks.
The U.S. and China have set a March 1 deadline to negotiate an agreement before American tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese imports rise to 25 percent from 10 percent. In a Twitter post on Sunday, after a week-long round of talks in Beijing, Trump said “big progress being made on soooo many different fronts!”
China is proposing that it could buy an additional $30 billion a year of U.S. agricultural products including soybeans, corn and wheat as part of a possible trade deal, according to people with knowledge of the plan.
The U.S. is also asking China to keep the value of the yuan stable to neutralize any effort to devalue the currency to counter U.S. tariffs.
The White House declined to comment about a Trump-Liu meeting Friday.
Investors are keeping a close eye on negotiations considering a setback could undermine global markets as concerns grow that the bilateral tensions are hurting world trade. Shipping giant Maersk said Thursday that profit will fall short of expectations and the outlook for this year is bleak, while South Korea and Japan have reported declines in exports.

Manuel's win makes her the first black woman in Olympic history to win a medal for an individual women's swim event. The cherry on top? Her time of 52.70 seconds (shared with Canadian Penny Oleksiak) set a new Olympic Record for the 100-meter freestyle.
But perhaps the best part about watching Manuel win was her reaction once she had realized what had happened. She turned around, pushed up her goggles, and then her jaw literally dropped.
Manuel was shocked, and immediately overcome with joy. She waded over to her fellow gold medal winner Oleksiak and tearfully embraced her.
"It's a lot, I mean this medal is not just for me," Manuel told NBC. "It's for all the people who believe they can't do it, and I just want to be an inspiration to others."
Lin Manuel-Miranda tweeted out support for Simone.
While the official USA Swimming account shared an emotional photo of Manuel embracing fellow Olympian and teammate Lia Neal.
Comedian Leslie Jones was on hand to tape the historic event, and shared her excited reaction video with Twitter followers as Manuel exited the pool area.
You can watch the full footage of the exciting race on NBC's official Olympics website.There was a rumor recently that Kendall Jenner had signed on to be the new face of Calvin Klein's #MyCalvins campaign. The initial report from a source at The New York Post has been confirmed, and now thanks to WWD, we have a first look at photos from Kendall's shoot for the #MyCalvins Denim Series with photographer Alasdair McLellan.
In the past Calvin Klein has looked to other young talent to represent the campaign, namely Justin Bieber, who Kendall has already posed with for a spread in Vogue. Bieber's campaign was controversial because of reports that his photos were Photoshopped to give his muscles more definition and to make his penis larger, but so far it doesn't look like Kendall's photos will receive the same criticism. "It was super fun," she said about shooting the campaign. "It’s really exciting. Honestly, it has been my dream to be able to do something like that. Calvin Klein’s ad campaigns have always been so memorable."
Look for the campaign to drop officially in May, and keep an eye out for the first billboard outside of Opening Ceremony in Los Angeles in April, with others following around Los Angeles and New York on April 15.Careers & Training

O’Neill’s on Wardour Street
It’s not widely known but the Profumo affair, the political scandal that led to the resignation of John Profumo, the Secretary of State for War, in 1963, and ultimately the fall of the Conservative government a year later, was actually all the fault of Georgie Fame. A slight exaggeration maybe, but if he hadn’t employed the Jamaican musician Wilfred ‘Syco’ Gordon to play with his band occasionally, there was a chance that Britain’s political history may have taken a completely different course.

SAALBACH-HINTERGLEMM, Austria (AP) — Zan Kranjec became the first Slovenian skier to win a men’s World Cup giant slalom on Wednesday, less than two hours after countrywoman Ilka Stuhec won a women’s super-G in Italy.
Kranjec was more than a half-second off the lead in fourth after the opening run, but leaders Matts Olsson of Sweden and Manuel Feller of Austria both failed to finish their final runs.
“For sure, it’s a good to know that. I am happy to be the one to achieve it,” said Kranjec, initially unaware of being the first Slovenian winner in the discipline. “I don’t know what happened. The first run was not bad but I knew I could do more. I went to the limit and had a few mistakes.”
The 28-year-old Kranjec’s previous best result was third place in the Alta Badia giant slalom a year ago.
On Wednesday, he posted the 10th fastest time in the final run, but still overtook Loic Meillard of Switzerland, who was third after the opening leg, by 0.19 seconds. Mathieu Faivre of France was 0.50 behind in third.
“It was tough to race, especially in the second run,” Meillard said after earning his maiden top-three finish. “It’s a sign that we have been working hard. This podium means a lot to me.”
Seven-time overall champion Marcel Hirscher finished sixth, ending the Austrian’s streak of 18 consecutive GS races where he finished on the podium. He had won seven of the last eight races in the discipline.
Hirscher was already 0.71 off the lead after the opening run, and also struggled in the second despite changing the set-up of his equipment.
“So many times we have made the right choices, this time we haven’t,” said Hirscher, who lost grip on the course several times and at one point had to avoid skiing out by correcting his line with one hand in the snow.
“It feels like I forgot how to ski in two days,” said Hirscher, who won a GS in Alta Badia by a massive 2.53 seconds on Sunday and a parallel GS the following day for his 62th career victory, equaling the Austrian record set by Annemarie Moser-Proell four decades ago.
“It has hardly been this bitter before,” Hirscher said. “A complete off-day, congrats to all the other guys but from my side, this was very, very poor.”
However, Hirscher was the not only favorite to struggle on the Schneekristall course.
First-run leader Olsson, who was chasing his second career win, led Feller by 0.03 seconds as the pair had opened up a gap of three-tenths over Meillard and at least a half-second over the rest of the field.
But both looked uncomfortable in their final runs. Feller lost his left ski in a turn and slid off the course, while Olsson lost his balance and skied out halfway down the slope.
Henrik Kristoffersen of Norway and Alexis Pinturault of France, two of Hirscher’s main rivals for the overall title, finished seventh and eighth, respectively.
The race replaced the season-opening giant slalom, which was canceled because of bad weather in Soelden in October. A slalom is scheduled for Thursday, a replacement for the event canceled in Val d’Isere, France, 10 days ago.Each member of our countryside warden team has come from a different background.

- What’s OnSecurity & Vulnerability
I attended a Business Solution Summit hosted by Lexmark in Milwaukee, WI and was surprised by the stats given on data breaches within corporate America. It seems every time you listen to the radio, television or any news outlet, you hear about hackers, data breaches, cyber security, etc… In fact, every evening driving home I hear at least 3 commercials advertising “protecting your identity”. Never before has our country become so hostage to others looking to profit off of our vulnerability (and possibly innocence). For those who believe all you need to do is protect your Social Security Number and nothing bad will happen should think again.
Here are a couple of things I took away from the summit and wanted to share:
- $65 million = The total average cost of a data breach in the U.S. last year
- 36% = cause of information leaks – either malicious or accidental
- Information = intellectual property, state secrets, financial data, healthcare information, personal identification information
According to WSJ “Every major company has been attacked. We are at war! The absence of body bags doesn’t lessen the importance.”
The terms, Hacker, BOTS, Phishing, Social Engineering refers to outsiders and their methods to capture data which could be brought on by a terrorist or even a corporate competitor; however, Open Security Foundation found that 36% of all information leaks occurred from within a company’s own walls…meaning inside your own firewall. As stated above, this could be malicious or completely accidental.
What information are the “hackers” phishing for?
The answer depends on the “hacker” and the sources they have to draw upon – it could be large like Home Depot, Target, Anthem, IRS or a small business. Here in Richmond, VA we spoke to a client who had their information “hijacked” because someone innocently clicked a link or zip file attached to an email. Before you discount this and say, “I would never do that.”; or, “everyone in my office knows not to do that.” Think. This is how these people make their money and like everyone else in business, the better you are at your job the more you make. Some hackers might make a simple or sloppy attack plan and snag a few; and some take a little more time and make something look so authentic it fools even those who are on the lookout for scams. The client I’m speaking of was contacted and informed their data was being held ransom and for the price of $5,000 they would release the information. In this case the company chose not to pay and lost their data from the time of their last back-up.
Other information “hackers” are phishing for is intellectual property, state records and secrets, financial data, healthcare information or personal identification information, these were the primary drivers behind the Anthem and recent Federal Government breaches. According to one study, it’s not about credit card theft as much as it is about gathering as much information as they can to use. Of course we hear the big numbers like the Target breach – more than 40 million cards and Home Depot was more than 56 million! Bank Accounts used to be top – credit cards on the “dark web” (referred to by the FBI) is dipping and considered to be traded like a commodity. Records with personal information is on the rise, the more information you can collect about individuals, the more valuable. Imagine someone gaining access to not only your personal medical records, but your entire family’s medical records. What about your complete financial portfolio? Bank account information, mortgage information, retirement funds, liens, or, your Legal records? Bankruptcy, devoice, law suits pending.
How To Protect Your Information
Recently I spoke with two highly regarded owners of IT firms and asked how I can educate my staff to better fend off attacks like these. Their answer was, first start by never clicking on a zip file or any attachment from someone you’re not expecting something from. If you think it may be suspicious, call that individual and ask them if they sent you something. Second, have a good detection plan in place and ready to respond. Third, make sure you back up your data every day and know your data is good by testing the recovery.
All of this sounds scary and it should because no one knows how far this will go or the ramifications of it all. What I can tell you is Stone’s Office Equipment will provide your office with equipment to help eliminate some of the potential risks.
Isn’t Office Equipment At Risk Of Getting Hacked?
A couple of years ago, the CBS news ran a story about copiers having hard drives and how every time a document is copied, scanned or printed the image resides on the hard drive. They were able to “hack” into some of the hard drives and retrieve some pretty sensitive information. Once the story broke, we started getting calls from our customers asking if we knew about this and what measures Stone’s Office Equipment takes to protect their data. I talk more about that later.
Here’s how:
- Copiers and MFP devices featuring a hard drive are wiped at the end of your lease or upon trade in. We’ll even remove the hard drive for customers and give it back to them so they can destroy it themselves.
- Lexmark MFP’s wipe the device after every job: copy, scan, print and fax
- Sharp copiers and MFP’s some standard with Lease Return Hard Drive Clean feature – wiping the hard drive back to new status
- Many devices we sell have Authentication – which will restrict the devices or users from performing tasks you don’t want

Abstract
The main objective of this study is to investigate the consumption behaviour and consumption awareness of energy drink among university students. Data were collected from 750 students in Afyon Kocatepe University by questionnaire which is improved by writers of this article. Tests were done with SPSS end of the research. Chi-square tests were done in %95 confidence interval to determine the relation of consumption and awareness of energy drink among the university students with gender, age range, school which is graduated, monthly expense, smoking and use of alcohol, the most consumed beverage types, and degree of licence. According to search results, it was found that energy drink consumption behaviour did not change with regard to the different age. On the other hand, male college graduates compared to other types of high school, it was determined that 701 TL per month and over spenders in relation to the lower income groups consumed more energy drinks . In addition, it was found that the groups that use alcohol, smokers, coffee drinkers and undergraduate students were consumed much more energy drinks than the others. When the answers measured the energy drink consumption behaviour of the students participated in the survey were considered, it was concluded that the awareness of the energy drink consumption was not high enough.

NEW ORLEANS CVB INVITES LOCALS TO “BE A TOURIST IN YOUR OWN HOMETOWN”
Campaign encourages locals to rediscover New Orleans attractions and show support for hospitality industry
NEW ORLEANS – August 3, 2010 – Despite challenges created by the Gulf Coast oil clean-up process, New Orleans remains one of the fastest-growing travel destinations in the country. As the city works to communicate to the world that all things New Orleans are vibrant, ready and waiting for visitors, the New Orleans Convention and Visitors Bureau (CVB) launches this year’s “Be a Tourist in Your Own Hometown” campaign. The campaign’s mission is to inspire locals to reconnect with the attractions, restaurants and hotels that set New Orleans apart from all other destinations.
“Be a Tourist in Your Own Hometown” gathers and promotes coupons, special deals and discounts for dining, hotel accommodations, attraction admissions and more. For coupons and program details, Click Here.
“While the campaign has been popular in the past, in light of the oil leak disaster, there is an urgency to maintain the positive momentum our hospitality community has achieved, particularly this year, and specifically to support the local restaurateurs that make New Orleans a top culinary destination” explained Stephen Perry, President and CEO of the New Orleans Convention and Visitors Bureau. “We’re on track to have our best year since 2005 with record-breaking festival attendances, sold-out weekends and Travel + Leisure just placed New Orleans back on their Top 10 Cities in the U.S. and Canada- there’s never been a better time to get out and support our local businesses and enjoy all they have to offer.”
As part of the “Be a Tourist in Your Own Hometown” campaign, the New Orleans CVB has produced posters for local merchants to display in their establishments or storefront windows celebrating the spirit of the campaign theme with artwork by local artist Robert Guthrie.
“We locals know the secret that summer is a prime time to enjoy New Orleans” said Perry. “For example, the COOLinary program, which runs from August 1-September 30, offers fixed price menus at top restaurants and is a fantastic way to show appreciation for our culinary culture and have a great meal at an incredible price. And this year the Saints will kick off their season as the Superbowl Champions in the Superdome September 9, so that weekend New Orleans will obviously be the place to celebrate.”

- Academic Team
- Interact Club
- YLSET Team
- Spanish Club
- Psychology Club
In community service, Nicholas has volunteered for YLSET – “A Cause for Paws”, Interact – Nursing Home Christmas, and Hurricane Harvey – Disaster Relief/Operation Blessing.
Tami Goss, Director of Bands, said, “I have not known many students to be as focused, diligent, humble, caring, kind, and resilient as Nicholas Pfister. In the seven years I have known him, I would say that he has taught me for more than I ever dreamed of teaching him. He is a person of true character, with a strong moral compass, and a passion for music that is truly infectious.”
Brenda Legendre, Assistant High School Band Director, said, “Nicholas Pfister has been a student of mine for the past 7 years as a member of the Bridge City Band. During this time, he has become a wonderfully accomplished musician, displaying outstanding ability and work ethic. His determination to succeed has always made Nicholas an example to students around him both in the music classroom as well as in academic areas. Nicholas has consistently performed beautifully for our Band program and has been a source of pride for years. Nicholas, a 2-year All-State Band member, has served as a section leader and Big Brother in our Band and currently holds the position of Drum Major. This position brings with it a myriad of responsibilities requiring Nicholas to master the arts of multitasking and problem solving. To date, he has handled these tasks with the agility of a world-class juggler! It is clear that Nicholas Pfister is a young man who will always have an incredible impact on those around him. The future is right for this young man and fortunate are those who will have the opportunity to work with him in the future!”
Cathy Riley, English Department Chair and Director of Bridge City Strutters, said, “Dedicated and driven, NICHOLAS PFISTER is a leader in all aspects. He is an absolute gentleman with an exuberant personality. One might see NICHOLAS directing the award-winning Bridge City High School Band, competing at UIL contests in math, spelling, and vocabulary, speaking eloquently as he analyzes an AP novel at an inner-outer circle discussion in English AP class, or brainstorming new ideas for ways to serve the community. His music awards are extensive as he earned several TMEA awards, one being TMEA 5A All-State Symphonic Band. NICHOLAS wants to awaken hidden passions for music in his future students as his own band directors, private music teachers, and camp instructors have done. Becoming an educator, NICHOLAS PFISTER shares an adoration of music with his grandmother and educators alike that will ignite relationships, and those relationships will create legacies that continue as the passionate torch is handed down. Job well done, PFISTER! HUZZAH!!”
When asked about his future plans, Nicholas said, “After graduation, I plan on earning an undergraduate degree in instrumental music education and then hopefully work in the Dallas/Fort Worth area as a middle or high school band director.”

A little bit about India
Climate: The climate in Goa will be humid and tropical with occasional rainfall. Average temperatures between 25 C – 30 C.:. All the food at Samata Resort is organic and grown on site! Their chefs are incredible and will leave you consistently excited for your next meal!
What to Bring:.
A Little Bit about Modesty: Although progressive and heavily influenced by the West, India remains a modest society. Please dress with consideration.. 45 Rupees is around 1 CND dollar so no need to worry when you finish up that 1 hour long ayurvedic massage or oil treatment and it costs 1000 Rupees, that’s only $20!
Tipping: Although not an Indian custom, tipping has become common with the increase in tourism throughout the years. A 10% tip on your bill goes a long way for your server and will definitely put a smile on their face.
Extending your Trip: Sometimes when 30 days just isn’t enough time you may want to extend your return flight back to reality. Each airline has different rules in changing flights but generally this can be arranged for a reasonable fee. We will be happy to assist you with this and support your new dreams to become an Indian beach bum! E-mail us at info@breatheinlife.com to inquire about a flight.

Nature Explorer Guide for Kids by Michael Leach and Meriel Lland (QED Publishing)
Posted by ReadItDaddy at October 25, 2016 Labels: Meriel Lland, Michael Leach, Nature Explorer Guide for Kids, QED Publishing
And we love taking books like this with us when we take off at the weekends for a bit of exploring. "Nature Explorer Guide for Kids" might have the world's most no-nonsense title but this book from Michael Leach and Meriel Lland encourages children to switch off their television sets and go out and do something less boring instead (bonus points if you can guess which 70s and 80s kids TV show I just stole that line from).
This handy book is easy to tuck into your backpack before you take off out into the great outdoors, and inspires the imagination with some brilliant tricks and tips on enjoying the countryside.
Track animal species by their footprints and their, er, poo. Test out your photography skills with some utterly fantastic tips on wildlife photography and set up your own fantastic den to tuck yourself away in while you observe the comings and goings of the woodland creatures inhabiting your locale.
The book is nicely divided up into easy to digest sections so kids can get the most out of the subjects. Illustrated throughout with awesome full colour photo plates, it's a great way to enhance your own bushcraft and woodland skills.
"Nature Explorer Guide for Kids" is out now from QED Publishing (Kindly supplied for review).An unusual election campaign in Catalonia
Ahead of the early regional elections in Catalonia on December 21 the Spanish authorities are taking action against the separatists. The Court of Auditors ordered the seizure of former Catalan leader Arturo Mas's house on Tuesday. The European warrant for the arrest of the deposed Catalan head of government Carles Puigdemont, who fled to Belgium, has been withdrawn, but the Spanish arrest warrant is still pending. Spain's media try to shed light on an unusual election campaign.
No mercy for criminal separatists
The Socialist leading candidate in the Catalonian regional elections, Miquel Iceta, has said that if he wins the election he will campaign for the separatists facing trial to be pardoned. El Mundo is against the idea:
“This is an inappropriate, hypocritical and irresponsible position. Inappropriate because the trial against the separatists is still pending and a pardon would only be possible in the context of a conviction. Hypocritical because Iceta is the leader of a party that railed against the illegal actions of the deposed government. ... And irresponsible because the leader of the Catalan Socialists is calling for the pardon of persons who not only are accused of serious crimes such as rebellion and sedition, but have also proven incapable of unequivocally renouncing the unilateral approach.”
Puigdemont loves to cast himself as a victim
El Periódico de Catalunya fears that Carles Puigdemont could be planning to exploit his own arrest for the election campaign:
“Puigdemont making a surprise return to Catalonia, which would be followed by his detention, conveniently planned and spread by social and traditional media, could have an unpredictable impact on the electoral process. ... The images of the unacceptable police brutality of October 1 went around the globe and are still being used by separatists to legitimise a vote that lacked any democratic basis. In the same way the logical detention of Puigdemont after his escape would give the ex-president a major propagandistic trump that would bolster his discourse about being a victim.”
Spanish justice setting an example for Belgium
The efficiency and independence of the Spanish judiciary are things the country can be proud of, the centralist daily ABC stresses, criticising Belgium for dragging the affair out for so long:
“The clarity and diligence of [the Spanish judge Pablo] Llarena stand in stark contrast to the indolence of his Belgian colleague, who has once again postponed until the 14th of this month the proceedings for the execution of the European arrest warrant issued against Carles Puigdemont and the others who fled. This enables the ex-president to run his campaign as an 'exile', which is precisely what he wanted. At least the Spanish judiciary has responded and done so without letting itself be influenced by political considerations pertaining to public opinion or the election campaign.”
Arbitrariness has become the norm
The Spanish judiciary's course of action is by no means exemplary, Esther Vera, editor-in-chief of the Catalan daily Ara argues:
“When arbitrariness becomes the norm this is a sign that a political system is still a long way from being a mature democracy. ... Some Catalan and Spanish politicians want us to believe that a completely extraordinary situation is something entirely normal: an electoral campaign beginning while the leading candidates of two parties are excluded from it because of ideas they defended in a peaceful manner. One of them is in custody while the other is on trial in Belgium. The election campaign is beginning with an exhausted but indignant public that wants to hear serious political proposals for overcoming the current stalemate.”We’ve had the opportunity of testing the HTC One relatively early, since it’s launching next month. As you can see, we’re playing with it right now and it has made a great impression on us. The device was announced one week ahead of MWC 2013 and we got to handle it at the show in Barcelona.
We’re dealing with a smartphone that should be priced at about 600 euro, free of contract. The first impression is a very nice one and the texture at the back of the phone is very pleasant. This is a very compact phone, in spite of packing a 4.7 inch display. Its case is made of a single block of aluminum that takes about 200 hours of work to completely polish. It’s got Gorilla Glass 2 at the front and internally, the components are set up like a reversed pyramid: big components at the top and smaller components at the bottom, just like on the HTC 8X.
HTC One measures 9.3 mm in thickness, although it doesn’t feel like it and it also weighs 143 grams, but it doesn’t feel like it. The handset incorporates a 4.7 inch SLCD 3 display with a full HD resolution and it has 2 capacitive buttons below the display. The primary innovations here are HTC BoomSound, Zoe and BlinkFeed, plus the Ultrapixel camera, all of them detailed in the video below.
The power button also serves as an infrared blaster and at the back we’ve got polycarbonate stripes inserted in the metallic case. Finally, you should know that this model features a 2300 mAh battery, 32 GB of storage, 2 GB of RAM and HTC Sense 5.0, applied on top of Android 4.1.2.Camola Sustainable Foods
Two nerds with Italian heritage tried eating a grasshopper one day and fell in love with the idea that everyone should eat insects.
Silvia and Claudio have teamed up to bring you a line of products that are not only delicious and nutritious, but better for the environment and more easily sustainable.
Silvia and Claudio are Entomologists which basically means that they study insects. Silvia is the baker of the team. With their Italian roots they have created a “Bugscotti” that is delicious and like no other biscotti, has the added protein of the cricket powder.
What do crickets taste like you ask? Personally I don’t find a discernible taste difference in any of the Camola products. They will apparently taste like celery in the new soup line coming out soon! The cricket flour doesn’t emulsify like regular flour. This means the cricket flour needs to be mixed with regular flour to get the same results. Your baking will just have more protein.
I wanted to know how crickets were farmed. Camola will have their own cricket farm soon, but for now they have an outside source. The crickets are raised in controlled conditions until they are the right size and then they are humanely harvested by freezing. They are then baked in an oven and ground into flour.
How do crickets contribute to sustainability? From the website:
To produce 1Kg of cricket flour requires about 4 L of water. In comparison, 1Kg of beef can require up to 48000 L of water! The difference is astonishing! Insects also have a high conversion factor (amount of feed that becomes body mass): for example, 1Kg of crickets only 3-4 kg of feed are required, compared to the 10 kg necessary to farm 1 Kg of beef.
And nutritious! I already knew that they had a lot of vitamins and other goodness but wasn’t aware of how much until Sylvia let me know. Again from the website so that I have the facts straight: contamination.
This slideshow requires JavaScript.
Camola is going to expand into many different kinds of products, they are not just a bakery anymore! My favourite product so far is the “Bug Bites” which are basically little date balls that have the cricket powder mixed into them.
The Crick Chips and the Bugscotti are also very tasty. No discernible “off” taste in any of the products that I have tried so far. Try them, you just might like them!
All of the products can be ordered from the website and delivered to your door. If you visit the farmer’s markets, you will find them Camola selling there as well.
The website has just been re-vamped with all kinds of new information. The social media accounts have all changed as well. Find them all here:THE GUT RESTORATION PROGRAM

But there is plenty for Owls chief Carlos Carvalhal to ponder after watching his side suffer back-to-back Championship defeats for the first time in nearly a year.
Things could have been very different had the Owls taken their opportunities when they were on top in the opening 20 minutes against their Yorkshire rivals.
But gradually the Whites took control of the midfield battle as Wednesday lost their cohesion. Although the hosts monopolised possession, Carvalhal’s side lacked a cutting edge in the final third.
Leeds’ game plan was spot on. After a rocky start, the visitors tightened up their backline. They were disciplined, compact and kept their shape superbly.
Leeds bullied Wednesday in the middle of the park, winning more second balls and had pace on the flanks to quickly turn defence into attack. Hadi Sacko was a great outlet on the right hand side throughout. Summer signing Sacko supplied a pin-point cross for Marcus Antonsson to break the deadlock just after the hour mark.

Midway through the second half, Rob Green produced a great save with his legs to prevent substitute Gary Hooper from equalising after Steven Fletcher had wriggled his way past Liam Cooper.
But even with Tom Lees back in their line-up, Wednesday never looked totally secure or convincing defensively and Chris Wood stroked in a second late on to seal Leeds’ first victory under new boss Garry Monk.
As Carvalha conceded, the result capped off a “tough week” for the Owls.
Forestieri Fluffs His Lines

Perhaps it could have been a different story had Fernando Forestieri been more clinical in front of goal. All eyes were on the Argentine-born player, who was making his first start since apologising for refusing to face Norwich City.
He was taunted by the away fans for not travelling to Carrow Road but the little maestro appeared to be trying too hard to impress.
His uncharacteristically wayward finishing only compounded a frustrating derby for him and the team. Forestieri pounced on a mistake by Charlie Taylor, burst clear in a one-on-one situation but prodded wide. And less than 60 seconds later, he calmly rounded Green only to see his fierce effort headed away from near the goal line by Leeds captain Cooper.
After the break, Forestieri was switched to the left wing to accommodate Hooper. We saw a few of his trademark jinking runs and he forced Green into action once but the 26-year-old failed to provide that spark.

Forestieri is Wednesday’s best player and the spotlight is on him more than ever before after his decision not to play against Norwich. He has to handle that pressure and, like the rest of the team, cope with the increased expectation levels.
The problem is they remain too reliant on Forestieri to produce moments of individual brilliance to swing matches their way. Wednesday have only managed one league goal from open play this season and that came courtesy of Forestieri, who top-scored with 15 goals last term. Other guys need to step up and take the weight off his shoulders.
Wednesday’s Big Midfield Poser
It doesn’t help that the chemistry in midfield doesn’t look right. The Owls were lightweight in the centre, lacked steel and width. Things became very congested in the middle and that played into Leeds’ hands.
There was just no great speed or urgency to Wednesday’s play.
“I am not one for excuses as you know but we have had a tough week,” said Carvalhal.
Owls Steven Fletcher with Utds Liam Bridcutt...Pic Steve Ellis
“We wanted to give the same as we did against Aston Villa and Norwich, but the balance of the team is not at 100 per cent in this moment.”
Fielding Almen Abdi, who struck the crossbar with a 25-yard free kick before the interval, on the left flank is not getting the best out of the attacking midfielder. For the second match on the spin, Abdi was taken off at half-time after struggling to make an impact, although Carvalhal later revealed a shoulder injury also affected Abdi’s performance.
Abdi, primarily a central midfielder, said part of the reason why he left Watford in the summer was because he was unhappy that they played him out of position so why are Wednesday doing exactly the same thing?
Back in June, I wrote that the Owls should recruit a tall, powerful midfielder to give them more flexibility but that has not materialised.
It’s Time For Calm Heads
But what people shouldn’t lose sight of despite two poor displays is that this team came close to going up only three months ago. They haven’t become a bad side overnight.
Carvalhal said: “We lost a bit of confidence after Burton. The team didn’t recover as we expect. Leeds played very compact and physical and we needed to play with more mobility and pass and move. We didn’t do this.
“It is good that we have one week to work with the players. We need to refresh our batteries and start again. It is a good moment for us.
“We have quality in the team but we must put everything in the correct place. We have plenty of time as the season is very long.”Exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons leads to non-monotonic modulation of DNA and RNA (hydroxy)methylation in a rat model.
- Human Biomonitoring Research Unit
Besides genetic modifications, rapidly growing evidence has linked environmental pollutants with epigenetic variations. To date, only a few studies have been performed on DNA methylation changes of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), which showed contradictory results. These discrepancies might be partially explained by differences in used agents. Generally in in vitro studies, a single compound is used, while in humans environmental studies, multi-residue exposure is investigated. The present study aimed to study epigenetic alterations induced by multi-residue exposure to PAH. Female Long Evans rats were exposed to a mixture of 16 US-EPA priority PAH, 3 times per week over a 90-day period. The livers were used to assess the (hydroxy)methylation status of genomic DNA/RNA, together with reduced and oxidized forms of glutathione. The results of this study demonstrate that a multi-residue exposure to PAH affects glutathione status, DNA (hydroxy)methylation, and RNA (hydroxy)methylation, together with DNA PAH-adducts formation. In addition, a non-monotonic response relationship was demonstrated between PAH concentration, the levels of glutathione and DNA (hydroxy)methylation levels at environmental relevant doses. This hormetic response gives a novel insight concerning the toxicity of environmental pollutants such as PAH and the biological response that may be different depending on the level of exposure.Bayern Munich pledge money and support for refugees.
Bayern Munich have offered their support to refugees arriving in Germany amid the ongoing crisis in Europe.
On Thursday, the German champions revealed that they will offer refugees arriving or already in Germany “financial, material and practical help.”
Bayern will provide “training camps” for refugees, also offering free food as well as German courses and football kits.
The club will also put €1 million towards projects – chosen by the local politicians – with the funds generated from a friendly match.
In addition, Bayern players will be accompanied by a German child on one hand and a young refugee on the other when they take to the pitch for their next home game against Augsburg on September 12 “to set a sign for the integration of refugees.”
Bayern follow in the footsteps of several other German clubs and fan groups who have extended a greeting to refugees amid severe tension in Germany over the treatment of those forced to flee war-torn areas in search of asylum.
Last week several supporter groups from Bundesliga clubs displayed “Refugees welcome” banners on the stands of the stadiums.
The German national team this week released a video featuring Jerome Boateng, Ilkay Gundogan, Bastian Schweinsteiger, Mesut Ozil and Toni Kroos standing up against “violence and xenophobia” in response to scores of attacks on refugee homes that have taken place this year.A commitment to high standards, capacity building, and lasting impact – for the client, for the coach, and for the community.
Why Financial Coach Certification Matters
Over the last 4 years, organizations and funders have invested in Financial Fitness Coach (FFC®) training and certification to better support initiatives that create lasting impact. These organizations and initiatives are SETTING THE STANDARD and raising the bar:
For their Coaches:
“Because of my training as a Financial Fitness Coach, I am able to bridge counseling and coaching knowledge in a way that better supports the client. This knowledge helps me support my clients to set more relevant goals, and provides me with a better understanding of the psychology behind the effort it takes for them to accomplish these goals." ~ Shandra Thomas, AFC®, FFC® candidate.
For their Clients:
Financial coaching provides a person with the self-efficacy to take control of their finances in their own life. “Instead of treating people as though they are broken, we help them restore their commitment to their own financial goals. We help them find clarity around what is important to them. We help them address the obstacles and make a plan that they can achieve.” ~ Saundra Davis, MSFP, APFC®.
For their Communities:
Coaches who go through the Financial Coach training are better equipped to support other financial coaches in their own community. Many have gone on to provide financial coach training for local organizations, serve as professional mentors to fellow professionals, and share their knowledge on a personal level with their peers.
Organizations & Initiatives Using Financial Coaching to Create Impact:
Free From is a nonprofit organization with a mission to make safety affordable for all survivors of domestic violence so that they can build lives free from violence for themselves and their children. Free From “looks past crisis intervention to violence prevention, by helping survivors achieve financial stability so that they can leave and never have to go back.” By financially empowering survivors, they break the cycle of violence against women in the US, helping them achieve economic justice and financial independence. FreeFrom's Director of Financial Capacity Building Programs, Merlin Salammanca, knows that financial coaching works. She is an FFC candidate.
The program trained sixty (60) professionals to become AFC® and FFC® professionals, with ongoing professional development support. Financial Coaches were; and 93% of clients have either established, made progress on, or completed their goals.

All parents who have a baby in the Brilliant Baby program are encouraged to participate in financial coaching. For each of the first three monthly meetings with a coach, families receive $100 in coaching participation incentives.
In 2017, thanks to significant funding from Citi Community Development and additional support from JPMorgan Chase, United Way California Capital Region was able to make financial coaching grants to 5 local organizations focused on critical issues such as affordable housing, health education, credit health, workforce development, and domestic violence. An initial training was held for more than 50 nonprofit and public agency staff and other community leaders who work with financially-struggling people. Following this training, the organizations received a full-day, in-person financial coaching practical-application session, the opportunity to participate in 10 monthly web-based skills-building labs, funding for financial coaching integration work; and scholarships to complete the AFC and FFC certifications.

According to the piece, Saeed has been an SNP electoral candidate and the author, writing about an SNP leader, says
There is plenty of evidence that he sees the cultivation of Glasgow’™s Muslims as one of the ways in which he can achieve an electoral breakthrough in a city always resistant to the SNP appeal.
The author goes on to warn of the dangers of such an alliance:.
Tom Gallagher, the author of the piece, has been critical of Saeed before calling him “an unapologetic advocate of the hardline Islamism” and, in turn, was criticized by Saeed who accused Gallagher of “Islamaphobia” and of conducting a “witch-hunt”, two common themes used by Muslim Brotherhood organizations to attack their critics.5 Tech Trends to Watch in 2018
.
Cyber-Security Threats Worsen
This is not a new prediction, but "state" actors have now entered the scene, reportedly with backing from countries like North Korea, Russia, and China. They fund armies of hackers, who try to steal everything from nuclear secrets to bank codes, hacking into power grids and private accounts.
So it is not a stretch to predict that this will get even worse in 2018 now these hacking armies have learned how to game US systems, especially as we head into midterm elections next fall.. I fear this will lead to new hacking disasters in 2018 that we are ill-prepared to fend off.
More Folding Smartphones, Tablets
I saw some very interesting folding and dual-screen phone prototypes in late 2017, and I expect to see market-ready products next year.
ZTE released the dual-screen Axon M last month, but it's exclusive to AT&T, limiting its reach, and PCMag found it to be a bit buggy in testing. With a few tweaks, though, we could see at least one foldable smartphone and one foldable tablet late in 2018 from major players, setting in motion a new trend in mobile design going into 2019.
You Can't Escape Augmented Reality
In 2017, Apple finally embraced augmented reality with ARKit, while Google revealed ARCore, leading many to believe we'd see the first killer AR apps by the holidays. But as of now, I have not seen an AR app I can't live without.
I do think the smartphone is a great place to start in terms of getting people interested in the technology; we're already staring at the devices all day anyway. But I am becoming more and more convinced that for AR to really impact our lives, it will have to be delivered through some type of smart glasses, which I don't see happening before 2020.
AR, meanwhile, is often mentioned in the same breath as virtual reality. But I see VR taking off largely in vertical markets, where all types of industries are experimenting with it to see how it affects their workflow and potential profitability. For more on that, check out PCMag's October feature, How Augmented Reality Is Transforming Work.
All-Day Laptop Battery Life
PCMag's Sascha Sagan and I were in Hawaii recently for Qualcomm's Snapdragon Summit, where it talked up its always-connected PC initiative. The premise is that these Snapdragon 835-based devices, like the HP Envy x2 and Asus NovaGo, have built-in LTE radios that provide constant internet connections and 20 hours of battery life.
I'm not quite sure the always-on aspect will be these machines' biggest selling point, though. In our iPad research, we found that 50 percent of iPads sold include the LTE radio chip, but that only 25 percent of those machines ever have their LTE activated. I think the bigger story from Qualcomm's event is that incredible battery life. Imagine heading off for the day and not having to think about carrying a power cord for your laptop since you know you will get at least 20 hours of real use.
Social Media Regulation
I know this might be considered a bold prediction, but my contacts in Washington say legislators from both sides of the aisle are increasingly concerned about the negative impact social media has had on the election process and the political climate in general.
Although Washington had hoped Facebook, Twitter, and Google would police themselves, insiders I speak with are growing skeptical that these companies can handle it alone. Full regulation is probably not likely, but I would not be surprised if we do see some legislation. After all, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai already went after Twitter during the net neutrality debate.Our Loans

After two kilometres, the road forks uphill to the left and another two kilometres on brings you into the village of Islamlar. Continue driving through the village, passing the mosque and local shop and continue uphill. Eventually you will pass some honeycombed like tombs, most probably burial chambers dating back several thousand years. Another couple of minutes beyond here you will reach the brow of the hill, your starting point.
You will notice a water fountain recessed in to the left-hand side of the road. The walk starts just across the road from here on the right. Look for a well-trodden path that disappears up between two bushes, about 100 meters or so along this track you will notice a blue paint marker on a rock. These markers take you all the way to the fantastic vantage point overlooking Bezirgan.
The area you are walking through was an ancient settlement; at the start of the walk cast your eyes around to see rock tombs on the hill above. About ten minutes into the walk you find yourself walking up what you could imaging was a stone staircase in ancient times and around this point turn to look behind you and notice what looks like a chunk of city wall jutting out of the hillside.
Just around this point you may overshoot a not very obvious fork to the right. You will know that you have when you suddenly appear on a small plateau area with no blue markers. Retrace your steps slightly and at the next blue marker push through the bush on your left, the branches are soft and flexible. From here follow the trail, it is well marked.
Forty minutes or so into the walk you come to a flatter area that has been dug out in places recently. Ahead you will see what in winter and spring appears to be a small lake on the hilltop. On closer inspection, it appears that that it could have been a small amphitheatre. From here it is another ten minutes on to the viewpoint, which, when you get there is a good place to have a picnic if you have brought one. The patchwork of fields below in Bezirgan changes colour with the seasons.
Return to your car the same way you came up, remember to pause from time to time to take in the different views of the region. On a clear day looking towards the coast you can see the fertile Xanthos valley in the distance covered in greenhouses, whilst inland you can see Akdag towering high, its peak often covered in snow until early summer.Your Personal Data

I probably also removed some others requires so you might need to fix packages by adding thoses as BR for package relaying on kdelibs-devel & others (this work is already done for kde's packages ) Regarding the ibus functionnality (kdeplasma-addons) it seems now enable by defaut i hope i did not break anything. Regarding kdebase4-runtime i did split out of nepomuk daemon outside so we'll be able to provides eventually live-cd without it installed to get some additional free space. It would be nice if our non nepomuk users could test kde without this package installed to see if nothing wrongs happens (i did not find the time so far to test it correctly but i'll be able to do it probably next week) I did not test either the new dolphin ui (we might need to reconfigure our default configuration files in mageia-kde4-config), so you might use the vanilla-kde4-config package to use the « upstream » kde's configuration on the xguest user for example. While testing kde 4.8 (or waiting for it) you could give a try to tomahawk-player : it's a really amazing social media player. Just in case someone stand up & want to do the 8 hours kde's build you can have a look to the build order here : - Why not pushing Qt 4.8 when it's already out ? In fact it was in my initial plan however i noticed that they were some bugs reports regardings some changes in Qt 4.8 which affects KDE 4.8, so i prefered for now to stick to Qt 4.7.4. Of course we're still be able to switch Regards, -- Balcaen John Jabber-id: mikala at jabber.littleboboy.netEstablished.

The program was instituted by the Department of Defense to address the problem of land development surrounding military air installations. It provides for the development and implementation of a plan to determine those land areas for which development should be significantly influenced by the operation of the airfield. These land areas are then designated as the AICUZ for that installation. To provide for compatible development, the Navy acquired easements and fee simple ownership on certain lands in the noise and accident potential zones around NAS Oceana. While the specific terms of each easement vary, they generally prohibit all residential and people-intensive commercial development. In addition, the permitted industrial development cannot result in a high concentration of people. Land within the AICUZ program has been classified according to its potential impact from noise and accident potential. The airport zoning program requires the following: Noise Attenuation: Noise attenuation measures in accordance with the Virginia Uniform Statewide Building Code (USBC) are required for new residential construction, including additions, located within noise zones 65 Ldn or greater. Zones less than 65 Ldn are exempt from these requirements. The requirements apply to single family dwellings, duplex dwellings, semi-detached dwellings, townhouses, multiple family dwellings, condominiums, hotels, motels, dormitories and group homes. Non-residential uses requiring noise attenuation include assembly, business, business, education, institutional and mercantile uses. Disclosure: Anyone selling or leasing residential property within any noise zone or Accident Potential Zone is required to provide written disclosure to all prospective purchasers or lessees. Written notification must also be placed in all sales contracts and leases. Additionally, the City requires disclosure notes on site plans and subdivision plats submitted after 1995. Height regulations: Per Section 202 of the City Zoning Ordinance, the height of any structure may not exceed that permitted by Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Regulations. Land Use: The City worked with the Navy and surrounding localities to create the Hampton Roads Joint Land Use Study (JLUS) in 2005. This study explores opportunities to reduce noise impacts while balancing the communities' interest in economic growth and sustainability. In consideration of the JLUS Study's recommendations, the City adopted the APZ-1/Clear Zone Master Plan in 2008, which provides land use policy guidance regarding the future use of property located in the APZ-1 and Clear Zones around NAS Oceana. Land use in the AICUZ and APZs is further regulated by Article 18 of the City Zoning Ordinance (AICUZ Overlay Ordinance).

In fact, if you were to search books related to happiness on Amazon, you would find over 75,000 results. Author and psychologist, Dr. Martin Seligman has explained that the number one contributor to happiness is the quality of a person’s social circle.
That deserves a repeat:
The number one thing that contributes to someone’s happiness
is the quality of their social circle.
[ Just food for thought when it comes to being prepared for a disaster.
How is the quality of your social circle that you can turn to and rely upon when there is an emergency? ]
Our social circle includes our family and friends. Image source: win-with-women.com
Dr. Seligman indicates that the main reason women live longer than men is due to the fact that their social circles are larger. Many people think that when a man loses his wife, he will succumb sooner to death as well because he has no one to care for him except himself. However, that is not true. A man will pass away sooner because he does not have a social circle that he can rely on.
Hank Smith, author and public speaker, states that brain scans over the last decade have become absolutely wonderful. He says that our frontal lobe is where happiness is stationed. When a person feels very sad, the right side of the frontal lobe lights up. Then when a person feels joy, the left part of the frontal lobe lights up. Joy and sorrow happen in different places in our brain.
When we are happy, the left side of our frontal lobe lights up. When we are sad, it’s the right side of our frontal lobe. Image source: neuroskills.com
If we want to help the left frontal lobe of our brain come alive, we should try meditation. Hank Smith states that meditation can fire up that area and flood your brain with dopamine. The brain has over 100 billion neurons that all talk to each other, and in doing so, they need chemicals or neurotransmitters. The three chemicals that make a person feel happy are dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine. When the levels of these chemicals get low, it may make a person feel unhappy. Some people are able to finally feel happy by taking medications that help these chemicals return to normal levels.
Happiness researcher, Kate Bratskeir, compiled a list from forty years worth of studies. She called this list “The Habits of Supremely Happy People”. Some of these you may already know, but it’s still helpful to learn it ag’ain.
10 things that supremely happy people do:
1. They keep themselves surrounded by other happy folks.
Joy is contagious. You are 4x more apt to be happy in the future if you have happy people around you. Happy people like to keep uplifting people around them and tend to gravitate away from those who constantly bring them down.
2. They try to be happy.
When they aren’t feeling so joyful, they work to cultivate a happy thought and smile about it. Researchers say that resilience is the opposite of depression. Happy people cultivate resilience and practice bouncing back from failure.
3. They spend money more often for others than they do for themselves.
Givers experience what’s called the “helper’s high.” Money doesn’t buy happiness yet spending money on other people has more direct impact on a person’s happiness than simply spending on oneself.
4. They have deep in-person conversations.
Happy people sit down, face to face, to talk about what makes a person tick. Studies have shown that people who participate in more substantial conversations and less trivial chatting have more feelings of satisfaction.
5. They use laughter as a medicine.
A good old-fashioned chuckle releases those happy chemicals in the brain. One study showed that kids generally laugh 300x in a day where adults typically laugh 15x a day. Also, our body’s response to laughter is like the effect of exercise. Not only do happy people laugh often, they can laugh at themselves too.
6. They use the power of music.
The power of music compares to the stress-reducing effects that massage therapy has. Happy people know that the music they choose affects their mood, so they choose uplifting and positive music to power up their day.
7. They exercise regularly and eat a healthy diet.
Having a diet of unhealthy foods may contribute to depression. Exercise gives you endorphins which make you happy. It can also improve how you feel about your body even if you don’t lose weight or meet your noted improvements. Happy individuals keep themselves more active and healthy.
8. They make the time to unplug and go outside.
Continual time spent staring at a screen can bring on anxiety and depression. Happy people take time to meditate and disconnect from electronics for a time. Although technology won’t be going away anytime soon, engaging in a form of digital detox occasionally can give your brain the ability to recover and recharge which also increases your resilience. Next time you want to feel alive, try going outside for a dose of fresh air for 20 minutes. Connecting with nature is a sure way to feel energized.
9. They get enough sleep.
Lack of sleep leaves a person susceptible to bad moods, poor judgment and lack of clarity. Happy people make sure they get enough sleep (8 or more hours a night) to stay more emotionally stable and be less apt to cave in to stress.
10. They are spiritual.
Happy people express more gratitude, show more compassion, and feel that their life has a purpose. These are attributes promoted in most spiritual and religious practices. Being spiritual is allowing yourself to have a sacred time to truly unplug from the world and reflect on a greater purpose. It is having faith in something greater than oneself.
So how does all this relate to being prepared? Practicing happiness now can help us have the spiritual strength and faith to get through tragic and emergency times in the future. It can help us be able to comfort others, to not fall into despair, and to find joy in times of extreme hardship. Practicing these habits of happy people may even more essential in our emergency preparation than anything else.

Her film, Shyamchi Aai, is first winner of the President's gold medal for best feature film.india Updated: Dec 03, 2005 13:00 IST
None
Ninetytwo-year-old Marathi actress Vanamalaexpressed her displeasure over physical exposure in the movies saying such an act is against Indian tradition.
Indian traditional values do not permit such exposure, she said adding "the artists should not propogate violence through movies and instead tell people about non-violance."
Vanamala, who enacted Shyam's mother in first winner of the President's Gold medal for the best feature film Shyamchi Aai, was saluted on Saturdaythrough a special function organised at the International Film Festival of India (IFFI).
"It is a touching moment for me as I am being honoured for the movie which was shot 50 years back. I am overwhelmed," the veteran actress said. "Conceptualisation and story of the movie has made it immortal," she added.
ShyamchiAai along with MirzaGalib is selected for the NFA golden jubilee section of IFFI.
ShyamchiAai is first winner of the President's gold medal for the best feature film of India when the award was instituted in 1953. It was a landmark film based on book written by Sane Guruji, a nationalist and political prisoner.
A highly successful film, it is an evergreen tale of the bond between a mother and a child and a comment on the importance of family.

As Gwen Stefani beamed over her adoring fans Thursday night at Nissan Pavilion, her incredulous comment "Can you believe this is my life?" seemed a bit out of place. After being in the spotlight for more than a decade, her fame is anything but unbelievable: She's successfully branched out from her original band, No Doubt, to a dance-pop solo career, a clothing line (L.A.M.B.) and the silver screen ("The Aviator").
As such, her 90-minute show was more about Stefani the captivating persona than Stefani the singer. Good thing, too. The few songs that focused more on her voice came across as frail and thin; a typhoon of keyboards and percussion washed out her wispy ballad "4 in the Morning." For the most part, the show centered on spectacle: her elaborate costumes, eight-member dance troupe and intricate props (including a stage-long treadmill) captured the theatrical elements that so many of her songs require. And the plot of the show was Gwen -- her attitude ("Hollaback Girl"), her nostalgia ("Wonderful Life"), and most of all, her extravagant lifestyle ("Luxurious").
Stefani tried to connect on an equal level with her fans: She bounded to the back of the pavilion to serenade those seated in the lawn with "Cool," and she begged the crowd to sing along with "Orange County Girl," shouting, "That's the only [expletive] reason I'm here, is to hear you guys sing!" The song made her seem almost human (she is, after all, "just an Orange County girl"), but its many allusions to her other songs and to her clothing line revealed Stefani's true allure: that her modesty is about as thin as her iconic coo.

.”.Cordial and are often made with thinner, more delicate glass. Cordial glasses are also known as pony glasses.
Function
In the United States, cordial glasses are used to serve alcoholic beverages. In other countries, the glass is used to serve non-alcoholic drinks such as fruit juices or juice blends and in some regions sweet, carbonated beverages. Some bars and restaurants serve wine in a cordial glass, instead of a true wine glass, to control portion size.
Liqueurs and Cordials
Cordial glasses are used for flavored sweet liqueurs, also known as cordials. These alcoholic beverages may be flavored like coffee, chocolate, fruit or even blends of herbs; the base liquid is sometimes whisky, rum or cognac. The terms liqueur and cordial are used interchangeably.
Types and Features
Almost any smaller, stemmed glass may be called a cordial glass. While most resemble the larger, stemmed wine glass, a cordial glass may have a shorter stem or none at all, having a delicate handle instead. Most cordial glasses are made of clear glass, but they can be found in colors and shapes other than the traditional round. Cordial glasses are often included in gift sets which include a bottle of liqueur.
Size and Usage
Most cordial glasses will hold two to three ounces of liquid. When used serving liqueurs, the glass may be filled partially, often half way, while when used in serving other drinks, the liquid may come closer to the rim of the glass. The term "pony" glass is sometimes used because of the small amount of liquid they hold in comparison to other drinking glasses.
Benefits
Using cordial glasses to serve wine, punches or other alcoholic drinks at a party can reduce the amount of alcohol an individual guest has the opportunity to drink. It also allows the host to determine how much alcohol they may need to have on hand.Modern life is full of highs and lows; advantages and disadvantages; triumphs and frustrations. While we certainly have luxuries that make life easier today, we also have a lot of unresolved societal and political issues that span many countries and socioeconomic groups. Italian artist Marco Melgrati recognizes the problems that we face in modern life and transforms them into truthful illustrations. Take a look at some of his best work below.
Here are some illustrations about modern life that we can all relate to:
1. We are constantly trying to stay relevant with new hashtags to get people’s attention.
2. In modern life, we live behind screens, almost like we are prisoners in a virtual world.
3. What happened to the days when music was actually good?
4. In modern life, medical treatment is becoming harder and harder to afford, so many people simply go without.
5. Smartphones will never replace our biological need for human contact.
6. “Time to evolve.” Do you agree?
7. Many people in modern life feel that money is the root of all evil.
8. Social media has allowed people to express themselves, but how much is too much?
9. True love is priceless, or is it?
10. What if this is what zoos will look like in the future?
11. In modern life, we try to look our best online, even if our real life doesn’t match our virtual persona.

At Mixology Wine, our goal was to create the longest, most comprehensive bartending training in the United States.
In the Tri State area, we're very close to New York, which is the most innovative city in the world as far as drinks go, although London, San Francisco, and Tokyo are close. Bars in Philly, New Jersey, and the Lehigh Valley are very influenced by their NYC counterparts. With the economy the way it is, we wanted our students to have an overwhelming advantage in this job market. With unemployment so high, there's a lot of competition for good bartending jobs, that can pay upwards of $400.00 a shift. We wanted our graduates to be able to compete at this level, right out of school.
With the Mixology Essentials, we cover the fundamentals of bartending in extreme detail. We believe that bartenders should give as much respect, consideration, and courtesy to the customers who order a Old Fashioned, as to those that order Irish Car Bombs. Most of the training is hands on behind a real bar, with ice, soda guns etc. Learning to bartend is a lot more physical than something like accounting, it should feel like learning a sport, or learning how to type, after about 48 hours behind the bar, what used to feel awkward and strange feels second nature, and there's no substitute for putting those hours in, they're essential.
With the targeted advanced training that we do, our seminars on Wine, Beer, ServSafe, and Bar Flair, our goal was both to make our students exceptional, and to push their comfort zone a little. It's very rare in this industry to find someone that can do everything. Bartenders who know about beer, usually don't know how to make drinks. Bartenders who can flip bottles usually can't make drinks that taste very good etc. We wanted to have a program that would not only train graduates who were confident in their mastery of the different disciplines in this field, but that would push them! It's a lot of fun to get people who feel clumsy and uncoordinated to flip bottles and breathe fire, and it's a lot of fun to get people who feel clueless about wine, to where they recommend it and serve confidently.
Lastly, we wanted our students to have the experience of working in a real bar, so we developed our Bar Externship Program. We have 12 bars that are currently participating, and the students will work for one night in a bar, and they'll bring their friends, make drinks, and keep all of their tips. It looks good on their resume, and they can make back part of what they spent on classes, but we really do it for their confidence. When they work in a club, or a jazz bar, or a restaurant, and they see that it's just like the classroom, all of their anxiety goes away, and they're ready to work!4Ocean

The Aspen Times
Lauren Glendenning/The Aspen Times |
A couple of Republicans took the AREDay stage in Snowmass on Monday and said they not only believe in climate change, but they’re committed to solving it.
“Most Republicans in Congress think climate change is real, and that man has something to do with it,” said speaker Rob Sisson, a Republican and president of ConservAmerica, a conservative green lobbying organization. “If they speak out, they stand to get toasted in the next primary election.”
Chip Comins of the American Renewable Energy Institute moderated the conversation, “Putting Conservation Back in the Conservative,” one of many discussions scheduled this week for AREDay, the American Renewable Energy Day Summit in Snowmass this week. Texas Earth Day founder and Dallas real estate developer Trammell S. Crow, also a Republican, joined Sisson for the discussion and added that Republican candidates are starting to address the issue more. He said “a number of them” are privately admitting they know the facts about climate change, but appealing to their electorate is another story.
Early Day Texas is reportedly the largest Earth Day event in the world. Crow said it brings together business and environmentalism, which helps make climate change more acceptable for conservative Republicans.
Religious conservatism is what’s holding back political conservatives from getting on board with combating climate change, or for some, even admitting it’s a real thing, Sisson said.
He said many religious conservatives think it takes an enormous ego to believe man can impact climate change — that man could impact what God created.
Sisson said ConservAmerica is working hard this election cycle to identify candidates who can carry the green message. The organization also is working hard to educate other candidates.
“I am extremely optimistic,” Sisson said. “I am Catholic, and I am just thrilled to death about Pope Francis and what he’s doing and his visit in September.”
The AREDay program prominently features the following quote by Pope Francis:
“The idea of infinite or unlimited growth, which proves so attractive to economists, financiers and experts in technology … is based on the lie that there is an infinite supply of the earth’s goods, and this leads to the planet being squeezed dry at every limit.”
Sisson’s comments set the stage for a later speech by former Colorado Gov. Bill Ritter, a Catholic Democrat who traveled to the Vatican to meet with the pope’s policy team to work on the Papal Encyclical.
The 184-page Encyclical released earlier this year focuses on everything from politics to economics to global environmental concerns, including climate change.
“I think it has scared a lot of people in the conservative realm, who have opposed any type of action on climate, because of the moral authority from which the Pope speaks,” Sisson said.
The messenger is just as important as the message, he said, adding that his organization can talk to a conservative policymaker about climate change and it’ll be received a lot more favorably than if the message comes from someone on the other side of the aisle.
Enter Ritter, following the Republican discussion, a Democrat pro-lifer who served one term as Colorado governor from 2007 to 2011 (he did not seek re-election).
Ritter, the founding director of the Center for the New Energy Economy at Colorado State University, was the only American at the table in the Vatican working as an advisor of sorts to the pope’s policy team. He spoke to the audience about the meaning behind the document and why it’s making history.
“Encyclical is Latin for circle, meaning to circulate. … This is the first encyclical in the history of the church that was written about the environment or touched on it in a serious way,” Ritter said. “This is the first ever not written to brief priests and bishops — it’s written to all human kind.”
Ritter noted that this encyclical, Francis’ second, is less about church doctrine than almost any other encyclical ever written.
“This pope thinks about and believes in our role in humanity as stewards,” Ritter said, adding that Francis refers to Earth as “our common home.”
Francis is scheduled to address a joint session of Congress next month, followed by a stop at the United Nations in New York. Ritter talked about the challenges in speaking to conservative Congress members about some of the Encyclical’s environmental and ecological points.
“Where it will have to be difficult for members of Congress to listen to him if he’s able to sort of go into this in great detail, is when he begins to link the ecological situation in the natural world and human inequality together with our own patterns of consumption and production in the developed world,” Ritter said. “And he makes a real case for this.”
When asked about the curious timing of its release, Ritter said it seems clear it was linked to the U.N. Climate Change Conference in Paris later this year, as well as the U.N.’s sustainable-development goals. Ritter said whether you agree with any, none of all of what’s in the pope’s encyclical, he calls it a “great read.”
“It’s been a long time since I sat down and read a document where I understood what I was reading was a different world view than the current world view that we inhabit and the current world view that we utilize to navigate through day to day, whether it’s about the environment, ecology or about just social condition, politics and economies.”

1.) I’m halfway finished (I think?) with the second book in the Unregistered series, which means I’m halfway through writing the entire series! I’ve planned three books. This one’s a little ¯\_(ツ)_/¯, because if there’s a solid way to tell if a first draft is really halfway done, I don’t know what it is. Right now, I’m just talking word count. My first book is currently around 50,000 words, so I’m guessing the second will be about the same. And of course the series may not be three books after all. But hey—I’m writing every day, and the story is flowing out like it wants to be told, so I’m going to go ahead and put it out there!
2.) Baby #2 is halfway done cooking! Now this one’s different—you can work on a book for decades but (thank the Lord) you can’t be pregnant forever. I’ve been pretty private about this pregnancy, at least here on the internet, due to some lingering fears after our last child died in utero back in March.
Of course, nothing is guaranteed in books or babies. Just because something is halfway there doesn’t mean it will ever be fully realized, because the future’s just not ours to control. I never felt entitled to have a healthy child, so being the mother to one healthy little boy makes me feel so grateful everyday, despite the beginnings of the terrible twos. I feel the same way about this pregnancy—though the aches in my back and hips, the climbing numbers on the scale, the bizarre changes in the way food tastes (ever bitten into a doughnut and tasted fish? Pregnancy is weird.) it’s still the best to be sharing a body with a little one. 20 weeks down, 20 to go!

It is tempting to see CPQ as a “sales solution” or a tool that only requires Sales to spend a few minutes in learning to navigate the app with little participation from others in your organization.
CPQ is not that easy, and the implementation project needs to be treated with great attention in order to assure that a successful system is deployed.
Here are three key issues that can cause your implementation to come up short. Fortunately, these issues are not difficult to address, but planning in advance is the best way to assure things go well.
Three CPQ Implementation Challenges and Solutions
1. One-Dimensional CPQ Implementation Project
CPQ is not just a sales app. CPQ touches multiple verticals within the enterprise, and it requires participation, buy-in and support from different groups throughout the organization. Product Management and Engineering have to provide specific information about the end-products as well as the parts and assemblies making up those products.
This must include performance-envelop data and other application-specific information. It’s not enough to know that a stainless-steel, chrome and carbon-steel option for part A is available. The CPQ system needs to know what assorted options are used or not used in a given configuration.
Pricing options are not just available, there are restrictions on discounts and usage of nonstandard price lists. Finance must provide that intelligence to the system.
Too many CPQ implementation projects start out and die because Sales management thinks they can do it all without help from IT, Finance, Product Management and other interested parties.
You can assure input, buy-in and participation for the CPQ project by first gaining an upper-management sponsor who can swing the big stick when necessary to assure that the right people have the right focus in terms of bringing the system online.
There is too much at risk to go it alone.
2. Bad Data
As the old programmers used to say, “Garbage in, garbage out.” The data accessed and used by the CPQ solution must be accurate, up-to-date and instantly and transparently maintained. Rolling out an end-of-year campaign complete with special promotional pricing and not updating the prices in CPQ is a sure way to destroy the confidence people have in CPQ and lose sales due to inflated prices.
The same thing is true with the configuration data contained within the system. If you are configuring a product using data from last year’s model, you are likely going to create a problem and possibly lose a sale.
All data within the system must be current, accurate and verifiable.
All proposals generated by the system must be data- and time-stamped to be sure of what generation of products, parts and assemblies were used within the quote.
Assuring this a matter of building the process for updating information into the implementation plan. Owners of specific data should take ownership of the process for making sure that data is kept current.
3. Incomplete Whole Product
Don’t forget that selling the product is only part of what has to be done to call a deal complete. The CPQ solution should not just be limited to getting the part numbers and descriptions correct; there are other things to consider.
Payment plans, finance vehicles, delivery options, post-implementation maintenance and the implementation/training or installation plan itself are all part of the whole product. Your customer will not consider the deal done if you disappear once the freight leaves the plant bound for the customer’s loading dock.
This is especially true if your product involves any virtual aspects or is perhaps a cloud-based product or other intangible offering. People have active imaginations, and they will fill in holes in your presentation with expectation that you might not be prepared to meet.
This falls upon product management. They are used to thinking about products down to the most basic components including the intangibles. Make sure they are included in your selection and implementation planning.
CPQ implementation doesn’t have to be a horror story, but it does require planning. Most importantly, it requires the participation of all stakeholders in the implementation process.
Keeping the team involved from start to finish will help to make sure that critical items aren’t missed.Five Things #51

Retail
Digital promotion and increased service experience
Eazie was looking to increase its appeal among its customers, upsell existing customers and reach new ones. It was further seeking a way to explain how the ordering and preparation process works. And the eventual solution had to be fast to implement, causing as little disruption as possible, and deliver a high return on investment with low operating and maintenance costs. Eazie approached De Digitale, the Dutch specialist in digital menu boards and digital signage.
Vogel's makes it easy at Eazie
What's so special about this project?
A five-screen signage array at the point of sale, another screen in the dining area and one in the window entice people inside, explain how things work and do justice to the delicious Eazie menu. The eye catching D-Line displays from Philips Professional Display Solutions are used as these support accurate ‘whites’, which is a key element in the Eazie house style.
To mount the displays, De Digitale used the Vogel’s Connect-it Series. This versatile mounting system is very easy to install and flexible. It is perfectly suitable for mounting digital menu boards. Thanks to the special Connect-it 3D interface strips it was easy to perfectly align the displays.
Who managed this project?
This project at Eazie has been realized by De Digitale B.V. in collaboration with our Dutch distributor Vogel's Professional Netherlands (VPN).
Quote from Jeffrey Brouwer, De Digitale:
We chose for the Vogel’s Connect-it Series. The 3D interface strips are adjustable in multiple directions, to perfectly align the displays. We selected a well calibrated Philips D-Line screen. This combination was the perfect choice for Eazie.

More importantly, though these books don't shy away from looking at the dark side of small towns: fear of outsiders, not accepting of perceived differences, the pressure of small-town saviors in the form of high school sports stars, and more. That combination of real-to-life exploring the highs and lows of suburban and rural life makes these reads not only obsession-worthy page-turners, but ones that will both give you the feels and keep you thinking. So, if you're looking for the ideal read to pack along on that road trip to that cute vacation spot or just need to escape from the comforts of your own couch, check out the 11 picks below.

7'Emmy & Oliver' by Robin Benway
Emmy wants to live without her parents’ relentless worrying. But Emmy’s parents can’t seem to let her grow up—not since the day Oliver disappeared. Oliver thought, all these years, that his dad was the good guy. He never knew that it was his father who kidnapped him and kept him on the run. Now returned to his old hometown, all at once, has his heart racing and his thoughts swirling. Emmy and Oliver were going to be best friends forever, or maybe even more, before their futures were ripped apart. To Emmy, despite the space and time between them, their connection has never been severed. But are their hearts like the pieces of two different puzzles—impossible to fit together?.
9'South of Sunshine' by Dana Elmendorf
Kaycee Jean McCoy has lived her entire life in Sunshine, Tennessee. In Sunshine, going to church is basically mandatory, and gay had better be your mood and not your sexual orientation. Kaycee may not agree with the town’s socially accepted bigotry, but she’d rather fit in than make waves. That is, until the beautiful, sexy, impossibly cool Bren Dawson moves into town. Kaycee is swept up in a whirlwind of exciting new emotions. One night Kaycee’s best friend catches them kissing, and Kaycee’s whole world goes to hell in a handbasket. What is she willing to risk for the sake of love? And what will she risk for acceptance?
10'The Distance Between Us' by Kasie West
Seventeen-year-old Caymen Meyers studies the rich like her own personal science experiment, and she’s pretty sure they’re only good for one thing — spending money on useless stuff, like the porcelain dolls in her mother’s shop. So when Xander Spence walks into the store it only takes one glance for Caymen to figure out he’s oozing rich. Despite his charming ways,.
11'Until Friday Night' by Abbi Glines
West Ashby has always been the cocky, popular, way-too-handsome-for-his-own-good football god. But on the inside he’s battling the grief that comes with watching his father die of cancer. Two years ago, Maggie Carleton’s life fell apart when her father murdered her mother. After that, she stopped speaking and hasn’t spoken since. As West’s pain becomes too much to handle, in the dark shadows of a post-game party, he opens up to the one girl who knows won’t tell anyone. West expected that talking about his dad would bring some relief...but he never expected the quiet new girl to reveal a pain even deeper than his own—or for them to form a connection.Child day-care and kids programmes

I’ve been volunteering with the group for four years, heading out into the South Cheshire countryside every other Sunday to do practical tasks for a number of different organisations.
Our tasks are varied and focused on helping to conserve or enhance particular habitats and environments. We often undertake similar tasks over several Sundays to enable us to complete larger jobs. Our tasks tend to follow the seasons with our cycle of chopping, burning, invasive species removal and meadow raking being very familiar to long serving volunteers. We also do some more obviously constructive tasks such as the bench installing and path building we did last weekend.
Over the course of each year we generally do tasks for Cheshire East Council Ranger Service, Cheshire Wildlife Trust and Natural England, although for a past couple of years we’ve also done some tasks for a private landowner.
The group doesn’t have an official motto but ‘Conservation & Conversation’ works pretty well – although something related to fire or biscuits could be just as apt!
The group moved into the 21st Century a couple of years ago with the launch of our own Facebook page and Twitter feed through which we keep follower up to date with our latest tasks.
As we move into the latter part of the year, my favourite kind of tasks start again – cutting down trees and setting fire to them! It may sound counter-intuitive to do this in the name of conservation but it is vital in helping to preserve some of the rarest habitats we have. Whilst I’m a believer in letting nature have its way, I also understand that if we did so without any management at all, we would end up losing some habitats that are now few and far between in the UK. That we have to do this at all is more than just a shame and entirely the fault of humans. Sometimes we need to take what would normally be odd action to help undo the harm we have done – if we don’t do something, some habitats may be lost forever.
Anyway, for me, there’s no better way to spend a chilly Sunday afternoon outside than chucking a few logs on a fire and spending a few hours poking it.Glacier Filtration supplied the Media and Carbon Filter systems comprising Polyamide Pressure Vessels and pre-assembled manifold and associated valving, unions and air release valves as well as a BetaLine UV Disinfection system with manual sleeve wiping, 316L SS chamber and Lambda2 PLC Controller for the Water NSW WTP at Lake Keepit.

But here is where the fun comes in - I bought the 88 Donruss because it has the puzzle groupings and my older daughter is obsessed with puzzles. We did a 750-piece Little Mermaid one and she actually built Ariel and some of the fishes. So a 60-piece Stan Musial should be easy enough. And a photo of my younger daughter opening her first-ever pack of cards - and inside she grabbed the first card and it happened to be one of my favorites from my youth - Shawon Dunston! It's not worth the cardboard it's printed on, but that is going in a case somewhere. Bent and all.

Customers Who Bought This Also BoughtDo male friendships really differ from female friendships? Is there such a happening as “friendship” between a man and a woman? Needless to mention, friendships differ. A relationship between men brings about respect, while friendship between women can be admirable. Nevertheless, friendship between a man and a woman is normally viewed with mistrust and suspicion. If we had asked people in the 1940’s whether men and women could be friends, the answer would probably be “NO.” But society has changed a lot throughout the years, and if we’d surveyed people today, we would most likely get a majority of “YES” answers.
I think the concept of friendship can be interpreted in many ways between men and women. The female friendship involves a relationship based on honesty and truth. We are inclined to open our hearts to each other, as we enjoy getting and giving advice. Men would rather do actions or activities and then talk about it. Do you know any men who enjoys talking to his friends for hours on the phone? Society can understand and accept friendship between persons of one’s own sex, but we often question and try to understand what are men looking for in their friendship with women. We often think that men just want to be friends with women because of sexual attraction and they are certainly hoping their friendship will turn into something sexual. However, studies have shown that men are also interested in friendship with women because they get a chance to talk and share, which is usually hard to do with men.
I guess we need to understand the needs of men and women friendships today. With men and women working together in different environments, there is a need for at least a business relationship. Take the case of women in politics, getting to know their male counterparts and developing a good relationship in order to get the work done. Well, even though men are from Mars and women from Venus it doesn’t mean the sexes don’t want to understand each other. Part of the interest between men and women being friends is the curiosity about wanting to learn more about each other. We usually wonder why men behave the way the do, and men want to know what makes us happy.
Overall, I think relationships between males and females do differ from relationships with people of the same sex; this is neither better nor worse, it’s just different. It’s easier to have a friend of the same sex, but it’s more pleasant to gain a friend of an opposite sex. It’s just the way we usually look at it, however, it does not matter if it’s a male or a female on the relationship, as long as there’s respect for each other. Only time will tell how long this male/female relationship will last, if the friendship is real regardless of gender, then we’ll always win.Show Racism the Red Card Vice President, Leroy Rosenior, is set receive an MBE for his services to anti-racism education
Leroy Rosenior, Show Racism the Red Card Vice President, has been awarded an MBE in the Queen’s birthday honours list for services to education thanks to his work supporting Show Racism the Red Card.
Campaign Officer, Ben Holman, spoke to Leroy prior to receiving his award...
BH: In the New Year you will be receiving an MBE for your services to anti-racism education. I imagine this will be an extremely proud moment for both yourself and your family?
LR: Yeah definitely, but it’s more for my Mum, my Dad - who unfortunately passed away over ten years ago now, my sisters, my children and my partner. They’ve allowed me to do the work at a cost to them and I know that they’ve supported me brilliantly so it’s more about them than anything else. It’s also about the organisation, Show Racism the Red Card. The organisation has been wonderful to me in terms of the way it has helped me to deliver the work and get around the country to further spread the message. So, its for all those people and I truly believe I’m receiving it on behalf of everybody who has a massive input in to the organisation and into me doing the work in all honesty. Personally, I’m very proud obviously to be receiving the award but it’s for all those people I’ve mentioned because they deserve it just as much as me.
BH: You’ve been committed to anti-racism education for several years now, have you always had your family in mind during the work you’ve conducted and has it been a motivation for you to want to create a better world for the generations that will follow?
LR: Yeah absolutely. My Dad told me stories about when he first came over and about the racism he first received, how he dealt with it was something that really inspired me. Then obviously going through school, when I was growing up, I didn’t feel as though I had any racism. I put it in my book that I was protected from it by my sisters and parents but when I started playing football, I started to realise what it was all about. To have the career I had, there were a lot of players who went by the wayside because they didn’t keep quiet. But to have the career I had I knew that I had to keep quiet but when I came out the game and that environment, I knew that I wanted to do something about it and Show Racism the Red Card gave me the platform to do that and they educated me as well. They put me on courses and I spoke to loads of people and it gave me the confidence to go out and tell the stories and to try not only educate but to help people come to terms with certain situations and help people understand. I’ve seen before that people haven’t accepted this award because it a member of the British empire but for me, I’m not a protester. I’m someone who wants to bring people together and to come from a family who were slaves, who were certainly not members of the British empire for somebody in Britain to now recognise that I am a member of the British Empire. In my work I have to remind people that I am British is major part because of the colour of my skin people don’t expect me to British I think it goes a long way towards helping our cause and I think it’s a helpful thing and I don’t want to just accept the award but I want to take it forward and use it a positive way to embrace more in people into anti-racism.
BH: You touched on there that when you came towards the end of your career you were looking onward to the next chapter, did you think back then that you would still be working tirelessly to this day to tackle racism in both society and football?
LR: Well you don’t because you work day in, day out, and you focus on the next thing and the next thing and you don’t focus on ten, fifteen, years down the line. But then all of a sudden ten years or fifteen years has passed by and you’re still working at it. But what I will say and what has given be the greatest satisfaction is I’ve been into a lot of schools and been back for second visits and when I’ve been back that second time maybe a year later the schools have said that the workshops, we did with them have been embraced by the children and they’ve really taken on the message. So, what we’ve been doing is teaching the future teaches and I’ve always said young kids get it and you go in to those schools that we’ve been in and anti-racism is part of the fabric of the school and something which is a top priority in the school and that is something which I’m extremely proud of.
BH: When you receive the MBE in the new year that won’t be the end of the hard-work though will it? Would you agree the work must be carried on for as long as it is needed?
LR: Well absolutely, I’ve got children and I’ve got grandchildren and I’m hoping that they don’t have to do what I do but I have a feeling that they might have to. Hopefully they won’t have to but I’m a realist and you can see that now racism is a part of society and we must be aware of that and we have to know how to deal with it. I might be talking about it until I go to my grave but hopefully, we won’t be talking about it as much and hopefully we will have procedures in place to deal with racism effectively and stop it growing into something which can cause serious damage to society.
BH: Back in October 2018 I saw Liam (Rosenior) speak to young people during a Q&A session at our educational event at Brighton & Hove Albion Football Club and he was fantastic. He had some really positive messages to share with the young people, has he picked that up from you?
LR: He’s been around me, he’s listened to me going on about it, he’s added to it and he’s a lot more intelligent than me and I’m really proud of him. He feels the same as I do, he’s had the same sort of treatment as me while playing, maybe not to the same levels but he felt exactly the same as I did when playing and he knows how to express himself. We need people in the position of role-models to express themselves in the right way to help people who aren’t in such privileged positions who maybe can’t speak out. He knows he’s got a responsibility and he takes it very seriously.
BH: Following on from Raheem Sterling’s statement about the incident at Stamford Bridge and his views on the media’s portrayal of young black footballers we’ve seen the topic of racism in football discussed on nearly every major media outlet and platform. Is this possibly a silver lining on what’s been a disappointing time for football’s fight to eradicate racism?
LR: Yeah definitely but I want people to have the conversations in the right way. I had to stop my car, pullover, and phone into a radio sports station as they had four guys talking about the Raheem Sterling incident and talking about it as though it was his fault. It’s great that people talk about it but they have to talk about finding a solution and not why it happened and if it’s Raheem’s fault but we got to talk about why people are doing it and I keep saying it but people aren’t born racist and we don’t want them to become to racist and to stop that we have to educate people. There are so many people I’ve spoken to have said things that would be deemed racism or ignorant things and I pick them up on it in the right way and they say, “I never knew that and going forward I’ll make a real conscious effort to make sure that not only do I not do it but other people don’t do it”.
BH: Going forward, what would you like to see as a direct result from the conversations that have taken place over the last few weeks?
LR: Firstly, the people who have abused Raheem Sterling I’d like to see them punished but be punished with a ban that lasts a certain amount of time and during that time I would like to see them get an education and take a course which helps them understand why what they’ve done is wrong. If they come out of the course understanding their mistakes, then I think they should be reintegrated into the football club. I don’t want people banned for life as they will go back into wider society and express those views that they hold and that won’t benefit society. In terms of bullet points I want all the authorities to come together, to put together, firstly it is all about money, a funding plan together so that if these incidents reoccur there is a procedure of how to deal with it and how to report it and show the positive results. Because when you don’t show positive results people think it’s disappeared show that these are the incidents that have been happening in our football stadiums and this how they’ve been dealt with and these are the positive outcomes.
You have to give credit to Raheem Sterling, he’s twenty-four years old and he’s been magnificent, the way he’s conducted himself, the way he’s got everyone talking about these important issues. You can not just shout and scream as people won’t listen and Raheem did it in a way that started the conversations. Gary Neville held his hands up and said I didn’t know how to deal with it which was amazing honesty and he used his platform to reflect on his past experiences and I thought that was fantastic of him.
BH: Thank you for you time today and once again, congratulations on the MBE, it’s well deserved.:.

Talented and ambitious DJ MaryJo proved no less on Thursday at Nexus Lounge as she hosted and headlined the 3rd edition of the Uganda Waragi Ladies’ Affair. Stepping onto the stage a few minutes after 11pm, the deafening cheers from the overflowing hyped crowd were enough to tell why the popular deejay is one of the country’s favourites.
The Uganda Waragi Ladies’ Affair was organised to celebrate the achievements of women in commemoration of International Women’s Day 2019.
Speaking during the event, Uganda Waragi Brand Manager Agaba Tumusiime said, ‘The Spirit of Uganda celebrates all things Ugandan and has been proudly associated with deejaying in Uganda for over four years. We set out to professionalise the deejay industry and are excited to be back to support some of Uganda’s very best female deejay talent.’
Battle of the sexes as the ladies showcased their talent.
The performances from the all-female deejay line-up of the night proved that the highly energetic and young deejays had risen to the occasion and fitted well into this male-dominated role. The female deejays XZYL, Lolah, Sheila ATS, Kathy and Nelly Rwaxxy, who have all grown to become as popular as they are influential, showed off three things that they have in common – girl power, the love for the decks and not being afraid to mix it up.
On what has made her successful this far, event host, Adero Marianne, popularly known as DJ MaryJo remarked ‘I have been in the industry a little over 10 years now and I am proud to see more and more females taking on the challenge. Deejaying is known to be the life of the party. You need to be able to resonate and understand your crowd, their mood and the music they love.’ DJ MaryJo added that at the time she began, female deejays weren’t a thing. ‘Today, our hustle has become more respectable and popular,’ she remarked.
Ladies enjoying Uganda Waragi at the event while having a blast
Cindy and the Band, who starred as guest performers, proved to be the icing on the cake as they lured the crowd with popular jams like Total Satisfaction, Amateeka and Onina.
The event went on till dawn. Check out some of the revellers having fun at the event;

About Me
~Ida Weronika K~
We are the unholy. We are the bastard sons of your media culture. Our minds, eyes and bodies are born for your exclusion. An illusion you hide behind. You don't love a God. You love your comfort. To you we are filth,we are dirty. So be it. We are dirty and unclean. A congregation of the unseen. Together we will set this world on fire. This is the new Religion. Amen!

Turlock Christian Preschool is an ACSI and WASC accredited program, infant through grade 12. Fewer than 10% of preschools are accredited in the United States. Additionally, the program at TCP is Christ-centered. We include Him in all areas of our day.
Bible Time
Each classroom has a daily Bible Time where we hear stories from the Bible, talk about God’s love, and learn about talking to God through prayer, with curriculum from ACSI (Association of Christian Schools International). Each week, we visit the sanctuary for a chapel service led by our teachers.
Art
Experiences with many different types of materials, which allow children to explore and discover, concentrate and carry out plans, develop new motor skills and controls, and help the children to express their feelings, as they create and explore
Language and Literacy
This area will positively affect visual discrimination, verbal expression, and creative thinking. It will also enrich their vocabulary, their awareness of sequential events, stories, and their listening skills. Students learn letter recognition and sounds, as well as writing, through our reading curriculum.
Dramatic Play
The children participate in role-playing, acting out feelings and emotions as they interact with other children. This also allows them to practice language and social skills.
Math
The children experience mathematics as they play in, describe, and think about their world. We develop skills in number recognition, counting, sorting, building shapes, finding patterns, measuring, and estimating.
Science
This area of the program will encourage children to explore, question, and discover. It will also help to develop skills in using scientific methods of problem solving, observing, identifying, and predicting and testing predictions.
Music
Children will learn songs, singing games, rhythm activities, music appreciation, creative movement, and the playing of instruments.
Motor Development
Children will develop coordination and strength in both fine and gross motor development. Important skills like running, jumping, throwing, and catching are developed through play and physical activity, as kids learn and practice skills that become building blocks for more complicated movements. Children also have a variety of activities to develop fine motor skills in the fingers and hands. Once strength and dexterity are developed, students are able to manipulate a pencil on paper.
Technology
Children will have small group iPad experiences that will focus on classroom skills, such as letter formation and sounds, sorting, counting, pattern, problem solving, or reading.

Disability Among Older Americans Declines
Chronic disability among older Americans has dropped dramatically during the past two decades, according to a new study. The study suggests that older Americans' health and function continue to improve at this critical time in the aging of the population.
The eagerly anticipated update of the last assessment of data from the National Long-Term Care Surveys (NLTCS) in 2001 was published on November 28, 2006, in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Funded through a cooperative agreement between NIH's National Institute on Aging (NIA) and Duke University, the NLTCS is a periodic survey of approximately 20,000 Medicare enrollees.
Dr. Kenneth G. Manton and his colleagues at Duke performed the latest analysis. They found that the prevalence of chronic disability among those 65 and older fell from 26.5% in 1982 to 19% in 2004/2005. The oldest age group, 85 and older, showed the most progress. Chronic disability rates decreased among those with both severe and less severe impairments, with the greatest improvements among the most severely impaired. Environmental modifications, assistive technologies and biomedical advances are all factors that likely contributed to these improvements.
The annual rate of decline in disability averaged 1.52% annually over the 22-year time span. However, the rate of decline in disability accelerated, from 0.6% in 1984 to 2.2% in 2004/2005. If these positive trends continue, the lower chronic disability rates among older adults could help bolster the Medicare program’s fiscal health.
“The challenge now is to see how this trend can be maintained and accelerated, especially in the face of increasing obesity,” said Dr. Richard Suzman, director of NIA's Behavioral and Social Research Program. “Doing so over the next several decades will significantly lessen the societal impact of the aging of the baby-boom generation.”Church-Wide Retreat

Don’t pretend you aren’t in agreement. Okay, so singing Christmas gadgets don’t have an illustrious history, consisting mostly of dreadful cards, scary leg-wobbling Santa robots, and Bigmouth Billy Bass.
But this dog’s different. My Nan bought him for a fiver from a random passing charity salesbloke, and he sings Slade’s ‘Merry Christmas Everybody’ while shuffling about a bit. Genius. No, really. And destined for a longer career in showbiz than Ray Out Of X-Factor. He does keep time properly in real life too – the audio is out of synch on YouTube.Newsletter Design Service.

Simulateurs d'airway: Fiables ?
A radiographic comparison of human airway anatomy and airway manikins – Implications for manikin-based testing of artificial airways
Schalk R et Al. Resuscitation. 2015 May 11. pii: S0300-9572(15)00199-9
----------------------------------------------------------
La maîtrise des techniques de contrôle des voies aériennes est un des enjeux de la médecine préhospitalière militaire. Le recours à la simulation est devenu très fréquent. Pour autant ce travail montre que cette méthode d'apprentissage a ses limites. L'une d'entre elle est le fait que les simulateurs de tache ne reproduisent pas correctement l'anatomie des voies aériennes.
----------------------------------------------------------
Objective
The aim of this prospective, single-center, observational study was to investigate the accuracy of modeling and reproduction of human anatomical dimensions in manikins by comparing radiographic upper airway measurements of 13 different models with humans.
Methods
13 commonly used airway manikins (male or female anatomy based) and 47 controls (adult humans, 37 male, 10 female) were investigated using a mediosagittal and axial cervical spine CT scan. For anatomical comparison six human upper airway target structures, the following were measured: Oblique diameter of the tongue through the center, horizontal distance between the center point of the tongue and the posterior pharyngeal wall, horizontal distance between the vallecula and the posterior pharyngeal wall, distance of the upper oesophageal orifice length of epiglottis distance at the narrowest part of the trachea. Furthermore, the cross-section of the trachea in axial view and the cross-section of the upper oesophageal orifice in the same section was calculated. All measurements were compared gender specific, if the gender was non-specified with the whole sample.
Results
None of the included 13 different airway manikins matched anatomy in human controls ( n = 47) in all of the six measurements. The Laerdal Airway Management Trainer, however, replicated human airway anatomy at least satisfactorily.
Conclusion
This investigation showed that all of the examined manikins did not replicate human anatomy. Manikins should therefore be selected cautiously, depending on the type of airway securing procedure. Their widespread use as a replacement for in vivo trials in the field of airway management needs to be reconsidered.

Last year Star-line sent me a sample of the new 223 REM brass. The brass was excellent. Primer pockets were uniform. OAL was excellent so there was no work involved in the primer pocket or trim length. The brass was within spec and could be loaded out of the box. Of course that is never recommended. Fully size all new brass for a semi or auto loading rifles or pistols. I expressed my concerns over the lack of a 5.56 NATO stamp, as probably others did also. Star-Line has responded. No longer will I need to mix and match head stamps. I now can count on using one and only one brass for my AR's. Availability of a high quality brass at a cost effective price no longer a issue. In many ways this brass rivaled Lapua at 1/3 the cost. Thank You Star-Line. Will4 Chic Ways to Refresh Your Office Look in 2015

Retrieve Deleted Facebook Messages: Here we introduce some techniques to recover erased Facebook Messenger messages. Shedding Facebook messages could be occurred on any kind of gadget or as a result of any reason. Yet the essential reality is that getting them isn't difficult.
Retrieve Deleted Facebook Messages
Each day, many people make use of Facebook messenger to attach to their good friends, household and service partners. It provides simple connection and quick communication. So after shedding some of these Facebook Messages a great deal of people could really feel irritated given that they do not know exactly how-- if any-- to retrieve these important work conversations or remarkable messages with their loved ones.
But the good news is that despite the device's brand name or design or running system, there's a high chance that these messages could be recovered and also accessed once again.
Relying on the operating system, iphone or Android, there are different techniques for undeleting lost messages.
apple iphone healing technique
Using an effective healing software application is called for to obtain Facebook messages. That's since there is no choice in Facebook Carrier to recoup deleted messages. As a handy iOS recuperation program, Wondershare Dr. Fone makes it possible to take back the data from apple iphone or iPad.
ollow the two actions listed below to get access to deleted messages once more:
Launch the application: Individuals have to attach their iOS device to the computer and after that check the iPhone or iPad. Don't worry if the screen turns black during the scan. It's normal. After the scanning for data is done, the outcomes will be revealed on the display.
Select the data for recovery: the check outcomes consist of all type of data such as papers, pointers, calls, call background, voicemail, photos, video clips, and so on, each in their category and also with the variety of found products details. Simply choose the ones needed to be recouped. Then, click the switch identified 'Recover'.
However occasionally simply the Facebook messages are archived. It indicates that they are hidden as well as users could not see them making them thinking that they have actually been deleted. In this instance it's possible to obtain accessibility to them with no software program.
However initial allow's take a look at how you can archive messages on Facebook Carrier:
In the Facebook Carrier application there is a tab named 'Messages'. There, a number of options will be shown after clicking any kind of message. Those include 'remove' or 'archive'. In this case choosing the archive alternative will cause the message to be eliminated from the checklist. But it's still there as well as could be accessed later. So remember it does not imply erasing whatsoever, just archiving.
So, in the event that some discussions as well as messages are archived, allow's find out ways to recover them.
Make use of the search feature and the get in touch with's name to find the archived messages. The 'A lot more' choices on 'Messages' tab includes an 'Archived' item. After accessing archived discussions, each of them could be taken back to the Messenger by choosing the 'Unarchive' alternative after clicking the message.
For Android phones as well as tablet computers the problem could be resolved through one more straightforward method. The deleted Facebook messages could be located on mobile phone memory considering that the Facebook messenger conserves them locally on the tool. So, even after they got erased they're not completely off the tool. In order to undelete these messages these steps could be helpful:
Make sure to have an application which permits exploring data and also folders of the phone memory and SD card. These apps could be downloaded and install with an easy search online.
After introducing the Android explorer app, open up the 'Android' folder from the SD card/device storage space.
After that open up the 'Information' folder which consists of various folders. These include installed apps documents and also data. Facebook Carrier data could be found under the 'com.facebook.orca' folder. Open it.
Now follow this path: 'Cache' > 'fb_temp'. Facebook messages and also various other backup data could be accessed right here.Sports Injury Videos
I have been in chiropractic for over 30 years. I remember a fellow chiropractor, Jan Corwin, D.C., being the first chiropractor on the US Olympic doctor staff for the track and field events. As a chiropractor he was shunned and placed in the locker room away from the physical therapist and medical doctors. They placed themselves at trackside for the immediate benefits of the track team.
Ironically, being placed in the locker room proved to be beneficial. Dr. Corwin provided help to injured players that were taken off their duties by either he MD’s or the PT’s. He adjusted the track and field players in the locker room and returned our Olympians back to the track. When other team members saw their fellow injured players get back into the game, they sought Dr. Corwin out with beneficial results.
I have taken courses on adjusting extremities inclusive of all forms of sports injuries from Dr. Corwin and many others over the last 30 years and while in chiropractic school.
There are many conditions that people suffer from which are related to sports injuries s that occur on a daily basis.
Below are a couple of clips regarding our Olympic team receiving chiropractic. I am sure that you will find it interesting and it will shed some light on the benefits of chiropractic care other than treating the spine. I am very glad to see that we are getting the recognition that we deserve from the Olympic officials.

These images sent by the Lyft driver, found the phone in the back seat of his car after he dropped off a few passengers. According to AndroidPolice, the driver thought his own Pixel 2 XL had somehow fallen back, but later realized it was the 3 XL after seeing the notch and Google logo on the back.
The unit had various identifying stickers, which have been blocked out. The driver (aka Alligator) returned the phone to the original owner a few minutes later.

A report from 9to5Google suggests that there’s a Ukrainian seller charging $2.000 per Pixel 3 XL unit. To get a unit you have to contact the seller via Telegram. Well, this was the major reason why only Russian or Ukrainian bloggers were posting accurate details about the unreleased Pixel 3 XL.

These images are enough to depict the device and all the accessories in greater details. Furthermore, a video by the author also depicts that the new Pixel lineup also supports wireless charging.
As far as design ergonomics are concerned the Pixel 3 XL is similar to its predecessors. The smartphone has a notch based display, a chin at the bottom, and the same old two-tone back design. Google Pixel 3 XL has a screen resolution of 2960 × 1440 pixels and the phone is powered by the Snapdragon 845 processor.

Google Pixel 3 XL: Camera And Wireless Charging
The blog stated that the Pixel 3 XL is again going to out-perform the imaging capabilities of other high-end smartphones. They shared dozens of images taken from the camera of Pixel 3 XL during the month of July. The images look sharp and clear and clearly blow away most smartphones in terms of dynamic range.
Lastly, Pixel 3 XL will be the first smartphone in the Pixel line up that supports wireless charging. A video by the author himself confirms that the device can be charged wirelessly. Apart from that, the device will retain its dual front-facing stereo speakers.

Lisa suggested that I might want to interpret that as 'business informal' and I changed out of my jeans and Def Leppard t-shirt and into khakis, a button down shirt and a tie. I hoped I wouldn't stand out as the 'over-dressed' bozo at the party.
Nature, in all its glory, would be hard pressed to equal the splendor of a room full of Pakistani women dressed for an 'informal' event. They came into the reception hall in small groups like schools of brightly colored reef fish and moved around the room like flocks of tropical birds. They were all wearing the traditional Khalwar Shameeses and flashed and sparkled with gold and silver jewelry. If there was a woman in that room who had spent less than two hours on her hair and make-up, I didn't see her. The Pakistani men were all, without exception, wearing dark business suits. Fortunately, I wasn't the only man in the room not wearing a dark suit. Most of the 'foreign' guests were dressed less formally than the Pakistanis, including a couple of Neanderthals wearing jeans and polo shirts. The very nerve! Apparently, in diplo-speak 'informal' means don't bother to wear your tux.
Because Pakistan is an Islamic country, the bar served soft drinks and fruit drinks but no alcohol. Nonetheless, conversation was lively and people seemed to be enjoying themselves in the reception hall. I met a Consular Officer and his wife who were from Lahore and they told me quite a bit about their city in particular and Pakistan in general. After speaking with them for quite a while, I've moved Lahore to the top of my 'must visit' list.
The food was excellent and plentiful so Lisa and I filled our plates, diplomatically, and snuck back for seconds. Then we went upstairs to the concert. Salman Ahmad is known as the John Lennon of Pakistan. He's quite a famous guy in that part of the world and had been invited here by the Ambassador to sing just for this event. He accompanied himself on the electric guitar and had a tamboori player sitting alongside him. That was very special for this event because the tamboori player was an Indian man and, given the historical state of tension between Pakistan and India, it was somewhat unprecedented that an Indian musician would be allowed to play at an official event in the Pakistani Embassy. Salman Ahmad is a Sufi Muslim which is a less well-known branch of the religion than Sunni or Shiite. They are the pacifists of Islam and seek to promote understanding and tolerance everywhere. Salman Ahmad also spends much of his time, talent and money helping to develop HIV/Aids awareness throughout the underdeveloped nations of the world. I suppose that's why he's known as Pakistan's John Lennon, that and the pony-tail. His music was good, in fact, it was very good. It's sort of driving rock & roll with a distinct Urdu flavor and the tamboori drums really had the place rocking.
I bought one of his cd's after the concert and have just spent an hour trying to put a song on this blog, but for the life of me I can't figure out how to do it. If anyone knows how to attach an mp3 file to a blog, I'd be grateful for the information.
The parking lots at the FSI are set in a circle around the perimeter of the campus. There are unmanned security gates at each of the outer lots and you gain access by putting your security id into a sensor and punching in your individual code number. Often this will cause the gate to unlatch and you can proceed through it to the campus. Sometimes, however, the gate does not unlatch right away and you need to reinsert your card and try again. If you are in a hurry or the weather is bad the gate never works and people behind you in line begin offering helpful suggestions. I like to use the lot behind the Language Building because it is the closest lot with the shortest walk and I'm basically lazy. It was pouring rain and cold one morning a week or so ago and by the time I got to the gate there was a line of frustrated language instructors trying to get through. The language instructors are mostly women in their late forties to early sixties and the 'helpful' suggestions they were giving each other in all the languages in the known world would have shamed a carnival barker. I'm quite certain I recognized the Bulgarian word for 'donkey' used several times.
I'm currently in my second module of GSO training. Last week in Module One we were given Tools of Management. These turned out to be things like Group Dynamics, Conducting Effective Meetings, Time Management etc. One earnest presenter even took the time to explain the clip art he'd put on his PowerPoint presentation while he read it to us. They all seemed to be required to read their presentations to us and to give us hard copies of the slides for posterity. Tools for management indeed, I'm sure that in some way I'm a better man for it.
This week is better. Module Two is Acquisitions and we'll be learning how to buy things on behalf of the government. Believe it or not, I'll be getting a credit card with a $5,500,000 limit on it. I have run a Mapquest on the closest Ferrari dealership and am now accepting applications for 'trophy wives' (Note the plural). I suspect that some form of regulation will come along with the card, but for now I intend to engage in massive acquisition planning. Learning to spend the government's money is hard work and I fully intend to become good at it.
Finally, I went into DC this past weekend and spent an afternoon at the Museum of the American Indian. It's well worth your time if you come to visit. The building itself is quite beautiful and I'll stick a couple of photos of it here.
So, until next time 'Haam kaal malingay' or 'see you again'.TO OUR SERVICES PAGE!

WebsiteSince many foot disorders are inherited, many foot problems can be diagnosed, treated, or prevented early on, especially if adults have these problems in the family. Issues common for children include: sport injuries, performance issues, growth plate injuries, warts, and ingrown toenails. With gentle care and patience, these problems can be cared for. There are techniques designed to keep the patient comfortable and active. These techniques can also offer permanent cures or preventions of injuries in the future. After you have been educated on your child’s condition, children’s orthotics, special shoes, and/or procedures rarely involving local anesthesia can be employed with your approval. If you have a pediatrician, they will be kept informed of the problems and treatment results so they can remain involved in your child’s care.The phrase “Big Data” is, well, huge. It seems everyone is talking about it, but there’s still a lot of confusion over what exactly Big Data is and how it can be leveraged to achieve business advantage.
Big Data is often described using the three V’s: Volume (the amount of data), Velocity (the rate of change), and Variety (in terms of format, structure, content, and language). Forrester Research goes one step further to define Big Data as “the frontier of a firm’s ability to store, process, and access (SPA) all the data it needs to operate effectively, make decisions, reduce risks, and serve customers.”
But, how can you leverage Big Data to your advantage? The key is Big Data Analytics. Just as Big Data has been a pervasive topic for the last few years, I predict that “Big Data Analytics” will be a major catchphrase in the coming year. In order to take advantage of the many business benefits analytics can provide, it’s important to understand the four key stages:
- Descriptive Analytics – What happened?
- Diagnostic Analytics – Why did it happen?
- Predictive Analytics – What will happen?
- Prescriptive Analytics – How can we make it happen?
When an enterprise makes it to step four in this process, it can begin to experience many significant benefits. For example, you can enable process improvement by streamlining inter-related business activities, make better decisions by using data-based evidence, and support continuous improvement. You can also gain valuable insight into the why? of your data. In a real-world scenario, a bank could analyze Big Data to detect fraud, doctors could determine best protocols, or auto manufacturers could determine the core cause of production delays. All of these scenarios require not just access to Big Data, but effective analysis of that data.
The benefits are clear, and yet, Gartner has predicted that through 2015, 85 percent of Fortune 500 organizations will failto exploit big data for competitive advantage. There are several steps you can follow to avoid Big Data Analytics pitfalls.
- Understand before passing judgment – Analytics has the power to create valuable operational changes, but these may threaten management. Therefore, it’s important to ensure that technical and business leaders trust the analytical outcomes. You should also try to depersonalize the data and create a shared sense of the purposeful impact it can have on business objectives.
- Determine who drives the analytics process – Don’t assume you need to put someone with a math degree in charge of analytics. The Big Data Analytics insights you garner should be easy-to-read and applicable to your unique business needs. You should leverage a data-savvy information worker rather than a mathematician who might add unnecessary complexity.
- Be careful when scoping a project – If the planned project is too large, you may not be able to gain value from your data. Instead, consider an agile approach where you can adjust the project as you encounter feedback.
- Create a strategy to improve business processes and outcomes – Determine measurable performance targets that align with your business objectives. Make sure the entire team is on board to instill a common sense of purpose in business and IT leaders.
- Consider security and data governance – Overlooking these factors can quickly derail a Big Data Analytics project.
By following these steps, you can ensure your Big Data Analytics project is not in the majority that fail or never get off the ground. You’ll be able to use analytics to create a competitive advantage—creating actionable insights that align to your business objectives and that can drive positive change in your organization.
As we look forward to 2015 and beyond, I see the Big Data Analytics ecosystem growing. We’ll see the emergence of more mobile and embedded BI, and an increase in social enterprises that collaborate, adjust, and optimize from insights generated along the business process journey. Stay tuned for more predictions on our blog in the coming month, and check out our webinar to learn how you can benefit from Big Data Analytics today: Big Data Analytics 101: How to Use It to Your Advantage.Kayleigh

Another map by Jakub Marian was made, so show us how much gold have we been putting aside as a reserve. It will probably shock you when you see the drastic difference between East and West Europe, the clear line of division between two Europe’s can be clearly seen just from looking at this map.
Gold reserves may expand or shrink as central bankers see fit, so differences in the size of gold reserves do not necessarily indicate differences in the wealth of nations.
Who has the most gold among Slavs :
- Russia – 11.7 grams per capita
- Slovakia – 5.9 grams per capita
- Bulgaria – 5.5 grams per capita
- Belarus – 4.3 grams per capita
- Macedonia – 3.3 grams per capita
- Poland – 2.7 grams per capita
- Serbia – 2.6 grams per capita
- Slovenia – 1.5 grams per capita
- Czech Republic – 0.9 grams per capita
- Bosnia and Herzegovina – 0.8 grams per capita
- Ukraine – 0.6 grams per capita
- Croatia – 0 grams per capita
- Montenegro – n/a grams per capita
Most national central banks in Europe hold a large amount of reserves in the form of foreign banknotes and deposits, treasury bills, gold, and other assets, which are called international reserves (or foreign-exchange reserves in popular usage, which, technically speaking, should only refer to reserves held in a foreign currency).
The map shows gold reserves of European national central banks in grams per capital as of May 2017; that is, if a central bank were to distribute the gold it possesses to all inhabitants of the country equally, every inhabitant would receive the amount shown in the map.
In other words, in case of a worse case scenario like catastrophes, world wars or other havoc situations some of the Slavic (and Eastern European) countries wouldn’t have any viable gold reserves to sustain and survive hard times over a longer period during any kind of catastrophes, recessions, wars and similar. Better start stashing that gold as soon as possible Slavs.Term papers online, academic paper title customwriting.biz

Consider the room
It’s important to pick a flooring material that will work with your space. Areas like bathrooms and laundry rooms benefit from material such as porcelain or vinyl tile to avoid potential water damage. High-traffic rooms, such as family rooms, need something more durable, like hardwood or engineered wood. If well maintained, hardwood is comfortable and will last for decades. AC Flooring offers a great comparison table of different types of flooring, here.
Get crack-free floors
Durability is key with ceramic and porcelain tile floors. The best way to ensure that your new tiles and grout remain crack-free is to install an uncoupling membrane underneath the tiles. These are dimpled plastic sheet materials that go down at the beginning of the installation. They work by allowing the tiles and subfloor to move slightly from side to side in relation to each other. Adding this small detail might seem unimportant, but it can make all the difference in terms of your tile floor remaining crack-free over time, especially with tiles installed over wooden subfloors.
Use transition strips
Got a tile installation that won’t sit entirely between walls? Will tile edges be exposed where they meet another type of flooring? This is where transition strips can help. The best are available in different metals, finishes and shapes, but all deliver the same thing — a refined, finished appearance where tile edges would normally remain visible.
Still not sure where to start? Find a professional who will install the perfect flooring that will stand the test of time.Zodiac Pendants and Blends
Show off your sign (while getting aromatherapy benefits!) with this artsy handcrafted aromatherapy diffuser pendant of your astrological sign in copper wire wrapped around a flat 15mm lava stone.
Plus get a Custom Crafted Astrology Blend by sign!
Take your pick:
- A diffuser pendant: A small flat lava bead surrounded by copper wire (with silver colored finish) depicting the sign. Exact pendants may vary due to their one-of-a-kind, handmade nature.

The blends are devised to be used with the diffuser necklace, or can be used with any aromatherapy diffuser! They are made purely of essential oils of the highest quality, so just use as your diffuser directs. For these diffuser necklaces, 1 – 2 drops every 2 to 3 days is usually sufficient. Get one of your sign’s blends or both, or not feeling what I picked for you? Choose what speaks to you the most.
Blends:
Aries: March 21 - April 19
Feminine: Citronella, Lavender and Frankincense.
This combination is gentle and floral, yet still strong and powerful. There is a sweet hint of citrus but a deep lingering undertone of a musky floral sophistication and depth that comes from the infusion of the lavender and frankincense. Eases anger and irritability, purifies emotions, fortifies and soothes spirit. Caution: Not recommended during pregnancy due to Citronella content.
Unisex: Lime, Marjoram and Frankincense.
The deep, soothing and sophisticated scent of musky frankincense is perfectly balanced out with a tangy, spicy element. Eases anger and irritability, improves mood, fortifies and soothes spirit. Cautions: Not recommended for pregnancy due to Marjoram content.
Taurus: April 20 - May 20
Feminine: Lemon, Lavender and Sandalwood.
The warmth of lemon tickles your nose at the first scent, but soon you experience a deeper, luxurious soft sweetness. It’s sweet, but strong and earthy; gentle yet powerful and rich. Lifts feelings of sluggishness, improves mood, increases openness and peacefulness.
Unisex: Black Pepper, Pine, and Sandalwood.
Spicy, woodsy, deep and luxurious, with just a hint of the sweetness of the sandalwood. Stimulating, grounding, elevating, brings peacefulness and invigoration, increases openness. Cautions: Not recommended for people with kidney disease due to black pepper content. Pine can be a skin irritant in some individuals.
Gemini: May 21 - June 20
Feminine: Cistus, Black Spruce and Bergamot.
Well balanced, with a slightly deep sweetness, tempered with a woodsy spice and delicate hint of citrus. Emotionally balancing, increases focus, grounds and elevates, improves meditation and intuition, raises consciousness and improves sleep. Cautions: Cistus can cause skin sensitization if oxidized.
Unisex: Peppermint, Black Spruce and Cistus.
A deep, lingering spiciness, with a hint of a woodsy air. Sharpens mind, increases focus, grounds and elevates, improves meditation and intuition, raises consciousness and improves sleep.

Both projects are already at an advanced stage.
Viking Wind has two current projects in the order book for fall 2018. Both projects are already at an advanced stage.
The Greenland project:
Ultimo October/primo November Viking Wind is going to supply the town Sisimiut in Greenland with a wind turbine, which will be a part of a pilot project to test the stamina of the wind turbine under extreme weather conditions as seen in the artic area.
The purpose with the Greenland project is the development of “Off grid” projects for the future, very similar to the Argentine project (further reading here), where the Viking Wind turbine will produce energy to a unit independent of an already established electrical grid. That gives the opportunity to be able to produce electricity in far away and isolated areas (with out grid or limit access to the public grid) where electricity is sparse, without dependency on fossil fuel. By that the secluded areas will be self-sufficient and no longer have to depend solely on more pollutant energy sources. The bonus is more sustainability and less pollution and will bring endless possibilities for secluded and impassable areas.
In Greenland the entrepreneur is already working on establishing roads and making a foundation for the turbine.
The Vejroe project:
The second project is on a small danish island with Vejrø Resort as contractor. According to the schedule the Viking Wind turbine is to be erected medio October 2018.
Vejrø Resort offers luxury island holidays in magnificent surroundings. The Viking Wind turbine is a part of fulfilling their mission of sustainability in the energy field while accentuating aesthesia and minimize the interference with the surrounding nature.
The turbine will , combined with diesel, sun energy and battery Stored energy, reduced the use of fossil fuel and supply the resort with clean energy and thereby be a major contributor in minimizing the use of fossil fuel, for the benefit of more sustainability (further reading about the Vejrø resort here).
Viking Wind is proud to be a main actor in both exciting projects!Chris Childs, CFA

Jackson 5 - The Love You SaveAfro-futurist Saturday
Afro-futurist working day to coincide with the exhibition Undefined Territories. Perspectives on Colonial Legacies. In the course of activities of different formats programmed throughout the day, we will address some of the themes of the exhibition: the imprint of colonial repression and dispossession, the ways in which imperial powers have exerted control through epistemic structures, such as political mapping and language, and the challenges of independence and the postcolonial condition, among others.
Programme
SATURDAY 28 SEPTEMBRE, at 10.30 am
► 10.30 am: Barcelona and America Tour: A Cartography of the Colonial Narrative (1835–88), by the Ruta de autor (Aymara Arreaza R. y Lorena Bou L.) collective.
Organised by the Ruta de autor collective, this tour of Barcelona will show how the coloniality of power functions, especially through the investments of the indianos (Spanish colonialists); it will reconstruct the transformation of the city in the nineteenth century and activate the imaginary that lies under the relationship between Barcelona and the American colonies.
Meet Point: Pla de Palau at 10:15 am
Admission: Free with prior booking. Limited places.
Duration: 3 h
Booking Access by clicking on the button.
► 6 pm: Let’s talk about Undefined Territories. Perspectives on Colonial Legacies with The Group of Black-African Thought, Practices and Activisms.
The Group is developing new ways of analysing and understanding the colonial project in opposition to the Eurocentric legacy and essentialisms. Here it will attempt to overcome the divisions inherent in the analysis of the question of the creation of race, which is usually defined in terms of sociology, philosophy, economics and psychology, or of class and gender, as isolated points of view.
Venue: Exhibition galleries.
Admission: Free with prior booking. Limited places.
► 7.30 pm: Afrogalactica. A Brief History of the Future (2012–present). Live lecture by Kapwani Kiwanga with video projection.
In the first chapter of her lecture-performance trilogy, Afrogalactic, Kapwani Kiwanga poses as an anthropologist from the future and reflects on some major themes in Afro-futurism and their role in the development of the United States of Africa Space Agency. She synthesises fragments of poetry, mythology, pop culture, science and scholarly discourse with archival imagery to challenge historical narratives. Afrogalactica: A Brief History of the Future mixes fact and fiction to generate new stories out of the canonical and the overlooked, while speculating on possible futures.
Venue: Capella MACBA.
Admission: Free admission. Limited places.
► 9 pm: Alien Nomad Sound. Jokkoo Collective. Music.
Jokkoo is a collective from Barcelona created by DJ Baba Sy and MBODJ that aims to promote African electronic, experimental and contemporary sounds, as well as their diaspora. They are occasionally joined by other musicians and DJs who share their vision and passion for music. Afroelectro, Ggom, Kwaito and Mzansi House are some of the genres performed in their sessions, in an attempt to take African music to another level and, of course, invite the audience to travel.
Venue: Capella MACBA.
Admission: Free admission. Limited places.

Sweet Corn
6 ears of Corn
1 tablespoon sugar
Prepare corn for boiling. Drop the corn into a large pot of boiling water that has been seasoned with sugar. Boil three minutes and remove corn right away. Spread melted butter all over corn and salt and pepper if desired. Sprinkle with Old Bay seasoning for a real treat! But that's coming from a Maryland girl! LOL!

Yup always add the sugar...that's how we do it in the Old Line State (MD).Apologies for not being around much lately, I’ve been putting the finishing touches to a new collection of tunes. You can listen to the whole album for free below:
And here’s a little rundown of what each tune is about or what inspired it:
Ace In The Hole:
When I set about writing this tune, all I had in mind was that I wanted something positive, upbeat and tuneful. I was thinking of tracks like Eric Johnson’s “Cliffs Of Dover” and Joe Satriani’s “Friends”. This is my contribution to the genre of melodic instrumental guitar playing.
A Taste Of Honey:
Herb Alpert’s version of this tune was always on in the house when I was a kid growing up. Both my parents were big fans of the Tijuana brass sound & this piece of music stuck with me. I’m a sucker for that up-tempo walking bass-line shuffle in any song and this was great fun to arrange for the guitar & record.
The Redcar Rag:
My good friend Geo (pronounced “Joe”) Ballentine is one of the finest acoustic blues guitarists I’ve ever heard. He sent me this chord sequence he’d recorded on his old Regal acoustic & asked me if I wanted to do something with it. I transcribed it and added a bassline & improvised the lead guitar part. Despite the fact that Geo lives in Pennsylvania, he suggested that we name it after my home town of Redcar on the north-east coast of England. Hence The Redcar Rag.
Andante:
As the brilliant Howard Goodall put it “If you can remember a tune, it’s probably by Mozart; if you can’t, it’s probably by Liszt.” That’s definitely true of this one – it’s the Andante section from Mozart’s Piano Concerto No.21 in C major. Definitely one of the most memorable melodies I noticed when I started to get all middle-aged & listen to Classic FM a few years back.
Echo Burning:
One of may favourite albums is Jeff Beck’s “Blow By Blow” & this tune is a nod in that direction. Tracks like “Scatterbrain” and “Air Blower” were foremost in my mind when writing this. The title is a reference to the Lee Child novel of the same name. I’d just finished reading this book when I was coming up with a title for the tune.
Flash In The Pan:
I was doing a lesson on songwriting with one of my guitar students and the basic chord sequence as well as the bones of the melody came together in the lesson as I was demonstrating various elements of composition. Afterwards, I listened back to it and thought “I could do something with that”… so I did.
Haystack Boogie:
Back in my leather-clad rocker days I always caught a lot of flack for having country albums in my CD rack. You can’t deny it though… guitarists like Albert Lee & Danny Gatton are the mutt’s nuts when it comes to blistering soloing. This is my little attempt to capture some of the feel of tracks like “Country Boy” and “Remington Ride”.
Lamplighter:
This one is me trying to get into that Dick Dale “surf” guitar sound. It’s based around the Neapolitan Minor scale, as used by Dick Dale in the classic “Misrilou”. As for the title, when I listened back to it it reminded me of old ’60s spy movies like “The Ipcress File” so I sought out a suitably espionage-esque name. John Le Carre refers to the technology section of British Intelligence as “the lamplighters” in his novels & this appealed to me.
The Texas Cannonball:
Of the three “Kings” of the blues (BB King, Albert King, and Freddie King) Freddie is the one who always sets my foot tapping & blood pumping. This is my homage to one of the greatest blues guitarists who ever lived. A big nod in the direction of tunes like “Hideaway” and “The Stumble”.
Weathering The Storm:
Of all the tracks on this album, this is the most personal to me. A really good friend of mine has been through a particularly rough time in the past year and I wrote this for him. Chin up, mate… you know who you are… it’ll get better in the end.
John Robson Guitar TuitionFight Like Apes - Lightsabre Cocksucker Blues
Steven Storrie | Wednesday, 23 July 2008
The music drives along relentlessly as MayKay yelps with pleasure, repeatedly asking: "Are you coming/Are you coming?" in a manner that suggests she doesn't really need to hear the answer. Or care what it is. There's a funky little riff going on in there at times which suggests a musical prowess far beyond the Riot Grrl rampage that this song leans ominously towards in its attempt to shock.
Nevertheless, 'Lightsabre Cocksucker Blues' is still the kind of single these bland times need. It's stuffed with sex and aggression in a way the charts these days just don't reflect. As an 120 second assault on the senses, it does a fine job, but lacks a memorable hook.
"Are you coming?" Fight Like Apes certainly are.

Keep your eyes peeled for comedian Louis C.K. at Pridwin cookouts this summer.
The funnyman purchased a charming Shelter Island cottage, nicknamed Primrose and once lived in by Babe Ruth, last week, sources tell the New York Post. (Editor’s Note: An earlier version of this story said Ruth owned the home.)
The six bedroom, 3.5 bathroom waterfront estate on Westmoreland Drive sold for $2.4 million on May 20, according to real estate listing site MLSLI.com
The three-story house also has six fireplaces, wood floors, a wine cellar, a screened porch, cedar closets and dock rights.
C.K. plans to restore the Tudor-style home, originally built around 1901 for President William McKinley and his paramour, a source told Newsday.
A representative from Daniel Gale Sotheby’s International Realty, which listed the property, declined to comment on the sale.

Going to close this one down somewhere in the next 6 hours or so. In the meantime, perhaps we could have a scavenger hunt to find the last message that had a direct connection to Ben's movie?
If there's a theme happening that someone thinks is worth pursuing further, please make use of the Proposed New Topics forum. If you do, please clearly define the new topic theme in both message 1 and in the topic title.
I'm saying science does not directly pursue the truth. It attempts to explain through falsification and testable methods. It attempts to compare competing hypotheses and theories to each other.
If you have a better method for testing and validating explanations of natural phenomena to determine if they adequately reflect reality I am all ears.
No, not disqualify. Rather science remains mute on the subject of the supernatural, religious or otherwise. We cannot test capricious supernatural causes (phenomena that defy the natural laws of the universe) using the scientific method. Science can only test and validate natural phenomena not supernatural phenomena.
Yes, but Attila the Hun cannot stop the motion of the Sun in the sky, speak whole universes' into existence, raise the dead and remove all traces of his existence from the annals and artifcats of history.
The probablity of the existence of Attila the Hun can be discovered through the scientific method and historical analysis. We can look at the literary and archaelogical evidence and determine the likelihood of Atilla the Hood existing. We can even determine the likelihood of the existence of Biblical figures such as Abraham, Moses, David and Jesus. However, how do you scientifically determine the likelihood that Jesus was the Son of God? Or the supernatural miracle of Jesus raising Lazereth from the dead? Or the parting of the Red Sea? Or God speaking into existence the creation of the universe?
I think that science does reflect reality many times but not in all senarios that attempt to explain reality.
And you determine this how?
Because intelligent design by its very definition invokes a supernatural creator. One cannot create the very laws of the universe if he is bound by them.
No, because the people who create these things are part of the natural universe itself. God is not.
If we allow all the miracles in the Bible to be accepted as naturally occuring phenomena than the known laws of physics fly out the window. 100 feet of water in a sea or ocean could part at a moments notice, dead fish and bread could multiply spontaneously, people could live inside the stomachs of marine mammals for days, foliage could burn without being consumed, animals could talk, celestial objects can stop and stand still at a moments notice, children can be born through immaculate conception, the dead rising from the grave, cats and dogs living together etc.
Might as well chuck all the scientific books, journals, etc out and go back to living in the dark ages.

On the previous page we looked at the quantity called impulse and noted that it was equal to a quantity called the change in momentum. The phrase 'impulse equals change in momentum' is a handy phrase worth memorizing. Here, we will look at several equations that present the change in momentum. Let us pick up by restating that the change in momentum, or delta p, is equal to the mass times the change in velocity, or delta v. Study the following four equations:
On the first line we state that the change in momentum is equal to the mass times the change in velocity.
In line two we change delta v to the quantity of the final velocity minus the original velocity, as one can do with any delta quantity.
On the fourth line we simply restate the change in momentum using the symbol p' for the final momentum and p for the original momentum.
Remember that the change in momentum of an object is equal to the impulse on the object. So, the last line above which states that the change in momentum is equal to the final minus the original momentum could be understood to state that the impulse on an object is equal to the final minus the original momentum.

Be the First to Review/CommentThe weather outside is frightful but that’s ok because you got your holiday lights up weeks ago. Ok maybe not but there is still time to make your property warm up with the spirit of the holiday with these great lighting tips from one of our local landscape pros.
It was one of those balmy 20 degree days we had at the end of October when I caught up with Danielle LeClair, one half of Urban Roots, Plant Health Care to learn a few tricks of the trade.
I am a Christmas in December kind of person but the last few years it’s been creeping up on me and I’ve found myself thinking about it in *gasp* November. I guess marketing does work… Or maybe I’m trying to be more organized?
Urban Roots is a local landscape company with two experienced, well educated, and down right great people at the helm. Jeremy and Danielle LeClair have been in the arboriculture and landscape industry for 10+ years. Working across the country, they have come back to Danielle’s roots in Nova Scotia and now call Pictou Landing home. Both are heavily involved within the local ISA (International Society of Arboriculture) chapter and hosted the recent climbing exhibition this fall in Charmichael Park. They were also awarded the 2017 Boston Tree contract for the second time and will be tackling that project in the coming weeks.
With the sun shinning and ground to cover Danielle and I chat for a few minutes about past projects, then get down to business installing some white lights on a client’s property.
The following is a list of tips and tricks we have both applied when working seasonal lighting into the landscape.
1. Buy all of your lights in one go. The warmth of colours varies from batch to batch. Even though the lights say they are all the same intensity, experience has led us to discover that if you buy a box here and there, the light result will vary.
2. If you require outdoor extension cords, make sure they are dark in colour. That way they will blend into the grass or shrub bed. Halloween is over so ditch the orange!
3. Cut all of the tags off the extension cords and strings of lights. Please.
4. Whether the lights are new or coming out of storage, stretch them out with a bit of a tug so they will lay relatively flat.
Pro-tip: Do #4 inside a warm garage or house before heading out into the cold. They won’t relax well, if cold.
5. Don’t wait until its cold! Put your lights up when it’s nice and warm. Your fingers will thank-you and your end result will be much nicer. Like the lights and cords in Tip #4, it’s hard to relax when you’re cold. I don’t like thinking about Christmas before December but this is one chore to check off early.
6. For shrubs, start at the top. Place the light strands on loosely as you loop around. Once you have as many on as you would like, go back over and tuck the lights into the shrub. Point the lights inward and out of sight. You don’t want to see the lights themselves, just their effect.
7. For evergreen trees start at the top as well but be sure you don’t loop the strand around the leader (central stem) of the tree. If lights are left on until next season, this will deter growth. Arrange lights loosely all over then go back and tuck them in.
Pro-tip: For a different look, try mixing strands of little lights and large lights together on one tree, shrub or grouping.
8. Use black electrical tape to secure the connection between the lights and extension cord. It will also help keep any water out.
9. Bury your lines. No need to hire an excavator, just loosen the soil with a trowel or your fingers and create a little trough. Lay the cord in it and cover back over with the soil and mulch.
10. Consider using a power stake. Available in most hardware stores, the stake has a series of outlets for outdoor use. Run extension cords to one spot vs multiple lines to an outlet on a building.
11. If you are going for a more symmetrical look, get out the measuring stick. Precision pays off when going this route. Gaps really stand out when everything is lit so use something as a spacer between your strings to ensure equal distance between each.
12. Be Safe. If you are using a ladder, have a buddy hold it and don’t go too high. If you are going to tackle a big tree consider calling a professional. They have the gear (and insurance) to get up and out of a tree safely.Andrew is a Partner and Solicitor in the Litigation Department.

'Michelle's Law' helps students maintain health insurancePosted On Thu, October 15, 2009
A new federal law will help younger people deal with the prospect of losing their health insurance.
"Michelle's Law" was signed by President George W. Bush in October of 2008 and took effect in recently. The law, which was named after a New Hampshire college student, extends coverage to students who may have to leave college because of medical reasons.
The seed of the law germinated based on the efforts of AnnMarie Morse, whose 20-year-old daughter died in November of 2005 after a battle with advanced colon cancer. Michelle Morse maintained her full course load at New Hampshire's Plymouth State University in order to maintain her coverage under her parent's health insurance policy.
AnnMarie Morse said when the law was signed that it was a bittersweet moment and that her daughter wanted her to fight on behalf of the law.
"She did not want any other college student to face the choice she had to make which was: stay in school and maintain her insurance, or take a leave of absence and lose it," AnnMarie Morse said last year.
A state-level version of the law was signed by New Hampshire Governor John Lynch in June of 2006. At that time, Lynch praised the courage of Michelle Morse and her family, and noted the student's legacy lives on through the difference she made and the legislation she inspired.
Rajnath to felicitate Phoolka for ensuring justice to 1984 anti-Sikh riot victims
New Delhi , Jan 12 : Union Minister for Home Affairs Rajnath Singh will on Sunday felicitate senior Supreme Court lawyer and former Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader H S Phoolka for his role in ensuring justice to the victims of 1984 anti-Sikh riots.
Phoolka on January 3 handed over his resignation to AAP chief and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal. He also represents Dakha Assembly seat in Punjab Vidhan Sabha, which Phoolka won as an AAP candidate.
Phoolka has been at the forefront of fighting the judicial battle of 1984 anti-Sikh riot victims. He is one of the petitioners in the anti-Sikh riots case. It was his relentless efforts which saw Congress leader Sajjan Kumar getting convicted and sentenced to life in prison in one of the anti-Sikh riot cases. He surrendered before a Delhi court on December 31, 2018.
It is worth mentioning that Sajjan Kumar, a former Congress MP, was convicted and sentenced in the killing of five Sikhs in Raj Nagar's Part I area under Palam Colony in south-west Delhi. The incident took place on November 1-2, 1984. Kumar was also charged with the burning down of a gurdwara, falling in Raj Nagar-II locality in south-west Delhi.

One of the ways we’ve done this is with the help of this (not so) little book:
Ever seen it? It is an AMAZING resource for all your travel needs. (We also have the “US & Canada Version” because those travels are more realistic these days.) Both books have must see’s, unique finds, and some lesser known places that are amazing, all over the world.
A few years ago, my husband gave me these books along with a photo book he’d created of all the places we’ve been together and left blank pages to include photos and captions of our travels to come! We also write the date we visited the “place” in the book once we’ve been there. It is such a fun thing to do together and makes for easy date planning. Wink. And in the end, we’ll be able to say we’ve traveled the world TOGETHER!
With that said…our date night is all about one of our dream destinations. ITALY!
You’ll want to print off this little card (download below) to give to your hubby:
You can leave it on his pillow, in his shoes, on his plate, or wherever! (If you have a cute little courier like I do, you can have them give it to Daddy in the morning so he can anticipate his “trip” all day!)
Italian Cuisine
Now there are MANY Italian cuisine’s you could put on the menu. But I had my husband in mind when I decided on Calzones. (Doesn’t that just scream ‘man’!) I have a super easy recipe for the dough that you’ll need to whip up earlier in the day (or you’ll have be waiting on dinner for a while if you are letting it raise!)
Calzone Dough
1 c. warm water
1 T. yeast
1 t. salt
1 t. sugar
1 T. oil
2 ½ c. flour
Combine yeast and water. Mix till dissolved and bubbles. Add salt, sugar, and oil. Add flour, stirring until dough pulls away from bowl. Turn onto floured surface and knead in remainder of flour. Form ball and place in greased bowl. Let rise till double in size. Roll dough out. Cover half the dough with sauce and desired toppings. Fold over dough, seal edges, and place on baking sheet. Bake in 375 degree oven for 15-18 minutes.
I set the mood by playing some songs by Andre Bocelli on our laptop as we put together our calzones. You can put whatever you want in yours. Ours consisted of pepperoni, olives, peppers, mushrooms, cheese, and sauce.
This is what it looks like all cooked. So good! Tell me your husband wouldn’t want to eat that!
Renaissance Culture
While our calzone’s were cooking, we took part of all the “art” that you can find in Italy. Using good ol’ Crayola Watercolors we channeled our inner Michaelangelo as we painted scenes of what we imagine Italy to look like.
Justin is obviously dreaming of Venice:
(yes, that says “Luigi’s Pizza Hut!)
while I was going more for Tuscany.
Now Italy is not just famous for the paintings. They also have a lot of sculptures. Michaelangelo’s “David” comes to mind. So, I told Justin that we each had to sculpt something representing your spouse. Using playdough, we both went to work. You could tell your husband to sculpt anything…be creative!
This turned out pretty funny because
A) we’re playing with playdough
B) my husband asked if it could be “symbolic”…oh great.
I tried to create “Thinking Justin” with a mini Jazz hat on, for my Jazz lover.
Justin on the other hand sculpted this.
What is that you ask? (So did I.) It is an apple. Huh. He explained that it was because I was a teacher! (Symbolic, remember.)
When I laughed at it he quickly squished it together and whipped up something new. This one wasn’t much better.
Yep, a donut. I’d been telling him for days that a donut sounded good. So that is what he made me! Silly guy. We are obviously not master artists, but it was fun to “play” silly things together.
At this point our calzone’s were finished cooking, so we put aside our “culture” and dined in candlelight.
“Foreign Film”
We are not all that “artsy.” However, I wanted to watch an Italian film…or at least one ABOUT Italy. My husband was thrilled when I pulled out this goody that we hadn’t seen in a while:
This is a great pick because it is “manly” yet enjoyable, in my book. Some other movie suggestions are: Life is Beautiful, Under the Tuscan Sun, Roman Holiday, Much Ado about Nothing, Angels & Demons, or any other Italian “themed” movie. I really wanted to watch the original version of The Italian Job but couldn’t locate it. That would have been fun!
So snuggle up to your “Italian Stallion” as you watch your flick. Oh, but don’t forget the famous Italian treat, GELATO:
Once the movie is over, you better rest up. It is a LONG flight back to the States!

This sounds fun! i love the theme!
GIRL! I love it! What a CUTE invite – LOVE the "Italian Stallion" part! Tee, hee. Gosh, I miss you!! Jamie & I might just have to get those books! I remember hearing about that present Justin made for you. I would LOVE to see a pic (or a few of them)…. That totally something I would love US to do!
Fun date! I love that it is at home. We have kids so if we can get our date at home, that is perfect for us!
This was soooo cute! I am a friend of Wendy Moon's and I LOVE creativity like this! Some of us (ME!) lack so much in the creativity department. Thanks SO MUCH for creating this blog and posting awesome ideas like this! My "Italian Stallion" will LOVE this! Look forward to more great ideas! Keep up the good work!
I'm SO doing this! Thanks, girl!!
VERY cute idea Erika! Good job!
Fun Erika! You've definitely found some creative outlets besides school. I love the idea, but how do I get rid of my 11 and 15 year old to have a date night at home? Hmmm.
Thanks Erika for the fun date idea! We made spaghetti and meat sauce instead. We drew pictures of Italy with markers and my husband was so cute, because he drew the shape of the country of Italy! His drawing was great. Thanks again for the great idea!
Your husband has a great sense of humor! (I can tell my the photos). A few years ago I gave birth to a baby girl. My heart stopped and has never functioned properly since. As a matter a fact only 27 percent of it functions to this day. I was not given much time to live, so when I saw this book, it became like a little bible to me. I would read a bit every day and hope that I could live long enough to visit all these wonderful places. This date his close to my heart. I will most def. try this out. Thank you : )
I planned this date for us last night. It was so fun and he loved it! Yummy calzone recipe, by the way! 🙂
I just found my next date! Thanks!!
Hi ladies!
I just did this date last night and it was great! We went to Italy on our honeymoon, so I cued up those pics on the screensaver, taped some maps and postcards on the walls, cued up an “Italy” station on Pandora, and voila! We did the painting while waiting for our calzone dough to rise, and the sculpture while it baked. My husband really got into the painting and now wants to find an art class/date night! I have a ton of your ideas bookmarked for the rest of the year-so excited! Thank you for such fun, easy, low-cost ideas!

WASHINGTON, D.C. (WCTV) -- Late Thursday, the United States Congress approved legislation to rename the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Health Care Center in Tallahassee in honor of Marine Corps Sgt. Enrest "Boots" Thomas.
The center is located at 2181 Orange Avenue.
The legislation was introduced by Senator Bill Nelson (D-FL) and Representative Al Lawson (D-FL) and was approved unanimously by the U.S. House of Representatives.
The bill now heads to the president's desk to be signed into law. It gained Senate approval in February.
"Sergeant Thomas is an American hero," Sen. Nelson said when he introduced the bill. "I can think of no more fitting tribute to his extraordinary service to our country than the renaming of this VA clinic in his honor."
“Sgt. Ernest ‘Boots’ Thomas exemplified selflessness and courage throughout his service, and I am proud to honor his legacy with the renaming of the VA clinic,” Rep. Lawson said.
Thomas, a Florida native, was posthumously presented the Navy Cross for his extraordinary heroism during action in World War II and was part of the original American flag raising atop Iwo Jima’s Mount Suribachi in 1945. He first joined the Marines in 1942 shortly after the U.S. was attacked at Pearl Harbor.
He was killed in action on March 3, 1945, just days after the now-famous flag raising on Iwo Jima.
A copy of the bill is available here.Carrabec (CHS) Class of 1973 Alumni List

Wellington 1, Bridgwater Town 1
A JAKE Llewellyn penalty six minutes from time salvaged a point for high-flying Bridgwater Town against a battling Wellington team in a competitive Boxing Day derby.
Bridgwater's starting XI included six former Wellington players but it was the Tangerines who took the lead on 16 minutes when Joe Chamberlain surged forward and picked out the bottom corner.
Llewellyn and Sam Towler saw long-range efforts fly wide as Town sought a response, though the visitors were disrupted by first-half injuries to Mark Armstrong and Tom Ellis and went in a goal down at the break.
Wellington lost their goalscorer Chamberlain to injury at half-time and two former Tangerines combined for a good chance early in the second period as Ian Bellinger's cross found Jack Taylor, but the frontman sent his header wide.
Bellinger then saw a shot saved before Jake Viney was called into action, pulling off a fine save from Glen Wright's efort to keep the Robins in the game.
The key moment came on 84 minutes as the referee pointed to the spot following a fould by Kai Fisher on Jake Brown - Llewllyn did the necessary from 12 yards to level the match.
Taylor nearly broke the hearts of his old side in injury time but fired into the side netting as the derby ended all square in front of a crowd of 135.
Wellington sit 14th, with Bridgwater in third - four points behind leaders Willand Rovers having played three games more than the Devon side.
On Saturday, Wellington travel to Bitton with the Robins on the road to Bradford Town.

Glenfiddich Distillery was founded in 1887 by William Grant and is now run by his descendents. Glenfiddich means "Valley of Deer" and that is why its logo has a Stag. Glenfiddich was the first whisky brand that marketed itself as single malt and now is the world's most popular Single Malt Whisky that accounts for over 30 percent of the total Single Malt Whisky sales worldwide. It is also the most awarded Single Malt Whisky at the International Spirits Challenge..’
Mr. McGhee has worked in Angola, Kazakhstan and Equatorial Guinea, in all of which countries the oil wealth floated to the top, leaving the poor behind. Mention was made of Venezuela and Trinidad which so relied on oil and gas, neglecting traditional industries, that as soon as the prices fell, the economies tumbled in sympathy. The apt question asked at the beginning of the article: ‘This largely underdeveloped country on South America’s Atlantic coast is the unlikely setting for the world’s next oil boom. But is it ready to handle the riches?’ The writer is not too sure. He points out that Guyana has only nine technically trained people responsible for regulating oil production, engineering and geological research. The legislation for the sovereign wealth fund is now in limbo. The energy department has not got off the ground. A bill to set up the petroleum commission is stuck in the National Assembly.
Government remains lethargic about preparations for the oil industry that investors are excited about and local commentators are wary of. Little public education has been undertaken to prepare Guyanese for the time when the inflow of income will become so great as to be now inconceivable to the average Guyanese. Yet this overlooked aspect is perhaps the most vital preparatory step in building public opinion to protect our oil wealth from theft and depredation.
As commentators concentrate on the alleged flaws in the Government’s contract with Exxon and local business organisations complain about the local content law, the Guyanese people remain largely disinterested, adamantly resisting the pressure to become engaged despite the publicity, greeting every new discovery with a shrug. By now they have certainly noted the discoveries, but it appears that the pervasive view is that there is nothing in it for them. This is not surprising. Guyanese have been fed a diet of false promises for decades, based on the fiction that somehow, an economy based on commodity production, largely unrestructured since colonial times, will somehow deliver a ‘good life.’ Unsurprisingly, the exploitation of our alleged resources has benefited only a few at the top and foreign investors. Too many Guyanese are poor and remain unimpressed and jaded, with little confidence that oil riches will trickle down to them.
Yet it of vital importance that the Guyanese people be equipped with knowledge from both the government and opposition of what the oil wealth will mean for Guyana. In the absence of efforts to educate the Guyanese people about what oil will means for Guyana, the less interested or equipped Guyanese will be to defend and protect the resources and the greater will be the theft. The common thread of the Wall Street Journal, Foreign Affairs and now the New York Times is the vast resources that will become available to Guyanese and the great benefits that will flow if it is creatively invested and not stolen.
Malaysia is an oil producing country, of about 700,000 barrels a day, with a population of 31 million. In May the governing party for decades, UNMO, was voted out of office because its prime minister is alleged to have stolen billions. Guyana needs a population, educated enough and militant enough, that will not wait until billions are stolen but will act promptly against any government that betrays the interests of the people. But alas, unless the system of ethno-politics is brought to an end by constitutional reform, and the current system remains entrenched, corruption and nepotism will rule the day.Type and then tap 'go' to search…

Amid growing complaints that parents are obnoxiously sharing too many photos of their young children, Facebook has announced effective next month, some users will be forced to migrate to Parentsbook.
Parentsbook will offer the same look and features of Facebook, but with a decidedly kids-centered feel to it. Users on this new social network will be able to share hundreds of photos of their babies — without driving their childless friends absolutely batshit insane.
Facebook administrators have already singled out the accounts that will be moved to Parentsbook, so there’s no need for users to opt in.
“We’re just going to go ahead and make this decision for everyone, for the good of the company and society,” said Facebook vice president Christine Hockman.
Parentsbook will sport extra features, for instance, the option to automatically “like” all the baby photos your friends upload, saving users from the dull task of clicking the like button for every visual proof of the baby’s “first whatever.”

Program coordinator: Lucie Dechifre
The actions of La Chaîne de l’Espoir in Jordan started in November 2012. The missions of La Chaîne de l’Espoir primarily focus on Syrian refugee children but also address the needs of Jordanian children meeting our vulnerability criteria.
OBJECTIVES :
- Operate on children with congenital heart defects.
- Operate on war-affected children or children with congenital orthopaedic pathology.
ACTIVITY :
- Cardiac surgery
The cardiac surgery programme started with the transfer of nine children to France in 2013 to undergo life-saving surgeries. La Chaîne de l’Espoir has been working since 2014 in partnership with a local hospital in Amman selected for the high quality of its services. Between two and five missions are carried out each year during which at least 10 children are operated on. Most cardiac surgeries involve open-heart surgeries.
- Orthopaedic surgery
Since 2013, between three and six missions with volunteers specialised in orthopaedic surgery are organised every year in the partner hospital in Amman.
Missions are carried out with a network of health players in Jordan. Such collaborations make it possible to identify and select patients and to carry out a quality postoperative follow-up.
- Missions
Cardiac and orthopaedic surgery missions consist of the following activities:
- Consultations: they are used to diagnose and select children likely to be operated on in Jordan. Children examined usually suffer from congenital pathologies and have a very limited access to the local healthcare system. The number of patients wounded or presenting war sequelae requiring orthopaedic surgery is strongly decreasing due to the closure of borders between Jordan and Syria since 2014.
- Surgery: surgical care of children identified according to an operative planning decided by the teams.
- Postoperative follow-up: assessment of surgeries carried out during previous missions and referral to appropriate care (e.g. physiotherapy).
- Theoretical and practical training of the medical and paramedical staff (mentoring in the operating theatre, organisation of workshops).
This programme is financed by the European Union - Humanitarian Assistance and Protection of Civilians (ECHO).

Stanford engineers say they might add speed, save energy
Two Stanford University engineers have developed a nanotechnology that could be used to mass-produce semiconductors that are much faster than today's chips while using less energy.
The key: functional carbon nanotube transistors.
H.-S. Philip Wong and Subhasish Mitra say their method still needs improvement, but could lead to digital electronics systems that are 13 times faster at the same energy consumption rate - or work at the same speed but use 13 times less electricity.
"If battery life is two hours today, you could do the same amount of work faster and with a much longer battery life," Mitra said.
The application addresses a problem that bedevils the computer industry: In order to continue the dramatic increase in capacity seen up to now, manufacturers will have to substitute something else for today's transistors. Otherwise, computer chips will melt due to the heat produced by the dense array of transistors.
Many scientists believe that carbon nanotubes will be the new fundamental product of the computer industry. Carbon nanotubes are semiconducting cylinders made out of carbon with a diameter of about 1.5 nanometers, about 1 million times thinner than a strand of hair.
The manufacturing method is compatible with the one used by the computer industry, where hundreds of silicon chips are made in parallel on a larger wafer to keep the cost low.
"We have found a way to grow nanotubes on full wafer scale," Mitra said.
They used silicon because the industry has invested billions of dollars in that material. But the nanotubes could not be grown directly on silicon.
"To grow nanotubes on silicon wafers is very unruly," Mitra said. "They really look like spaghetti or noodles. They are just all over the place. But if you grow carbon nanotubes on quartz, they grow along the crystal orientation of quartz."
In that way, the scientists obtained carbon nanotubes oriented parallel to each other. Mitra said the structure is not perfect, but it's good enough.
In a second step, the scientists transferred the carbon nanotubes from the quartz to the silicon wafer.
"It is a bit like how you do a kid's (temporary) tattoo," Mitra said.
On the silicon wafer, the nanotubes were connected to electrodes to make transistors and logic gates. The logic gates were designed in such a way that they compensate for any erratic growth of the nanotubes.
The scientists made close to 200 chips, each having about 1,000 transistors on the surface, with a density of about 10 nanotubes per micrometer. They showed that 99 percent of the transistors were functional.
But the density needs to be much higher in order to compete with today's technology - at least 100 nanotubes per micrometer. Mitra said that they may be able to achieve that by multiple transfers from the quartz wafer to the silicon wafer.
Another problem the scientists need to solve is that not all carbon nanotubes will grow into semiconductors. Some of them will become "metallic" and conduct electricity, which can short the logic circuit.
"We are trying to co-optimize processing and design to create circuits that can tolerate metallic carbon nanotubes," Mitra said.Abstract
In mammals X inactivation is initiated by expression of Xist RNA and involves the recruitment of Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) and 2 (PRC2), which mediate chromosome‐wide ubiquitination of histone H2A and methylation of histone H3, respectively. Here, we show that PRC1 recruitment by Xist RNA is independent of gene silencing. We find that Eed is required for the recruitment of the canonical PRC1 proteins Mph1 and Mph2 by Xist. However, functional Ring1b is recruited by Xist and mediates ubiquitination of histone H2A in Eed deficient embryonic stem (ES) cells, which lack histone H3 lysine 27 tri‐methylation. Xist expression early in ES cell differentiation establishes a chromosomal memory, which allows efficient H2A ubiquitination in differentiated cells and is independent of silencing and PRC2. Our data show that Xist recruits PRC1 components by both PRC2 dependent and independent modes and in the absence of PRC2 function is sufficient for the establishment of Polycomb‐based memory systems in X inactivation.
Introduction
Mammals equalise the dosage of X‐linked genes between males and females by inactivation of one of the two female X chromosomes early in development. In female mice the paternal X chromosome is silenced in preimplantation embryos giving rise to the imprinted pattern of X inactivation in the extraembryonic lineages. In the cells forming the embryo, the inactive X (Xi) becomes reactivated at the blastocyst stage, followed by random inactivation of either the paternal or the maternal X before gastrulation (Huynh and Lee, 2003; Mak et al, 2004; Okamoto et al, 2004). Random X inactivation is recapitulated during the differentiation of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. The formation of an inactive X chromosome comprises an ordered series of chromatin modifications, including post‐translational modifications of histones and the recruitment of Polycomb group (PcG) complexes (Plath et al, 2002). Initiation of silencing depends on the expression of the noncoding Xist RNA (Borsani et al, 1991; Brockdorff et al, 1991; Brown et al, 1991a, 1991b). However, Xist is dispensable for the maintenance of the Xi at later stages of differentiation, when multiple pathways including DNA methylation and hypoacetylation of histone H4 stably propagate the inactive state (Csankovszki et al, 2001; Hernandez‐Munoz et al, 2005). The silent state at the initiation of X chromosome inactivation is initially reversible (Wutz and Jaenisch, 2000) and is associated with chromosome‐wide tri‐methylation of histone H3 on lysine 27 (H3K27me3), mono‐methylation of histone H4 on lysine 20 (H4K20m1) and ubiquitination of lysine 119 on histone H2A (H2AK119ub1) as well as the recruitment of the Polycomb repressive complexes 1 (PRC1) and 2 (PRC2; Cao et al, 2002; Plath et al, 2003; de Napoles et al, 2004; Fang et al, 2004; Kohlmaier et al, 2004).
PRC2 contains the Ezh2, Eed, Suz12 and RbAp46/48 proteins and has histone H3 specific lysine methylase activity (Cao et al, 2002; Czermin et al, 2002; Kuzmichev et al, 2002, 2004; Muller et al, 2002). Recruitment of PRC2 by Xist and appearance of H3K27me3 along the Xi are among the earliest events in X inactivation (Mak et al, 2002; Plath et al, 2003; Silva et al, 2003). This has led to the prevailing view that PRC2 and H3K27me3 have a crucial function in X inactivation. However, recruitment of the PRC2 complex and H3K27me3 also occur in the absence of transcriptional silencing (Plath et al, 2003; Kohlmaier et al, 2004). In differentiated cells Xist is necessary but not sufficient for recruitment of H3K27me3, and thus H3K27me3 also depends on epigenetic information residing on the chromosome (Kohlmaier et al, 2004). When Xist is expressed during an early time window in differentiation, a chromosomal memory is established that enables efficient histone methylation later in differentiation. This memory is maintained in differentiated cells independent of Xist and gene silencing (Kohlmaier et al, 2004). Establishment of the memory temporally coincides with the transition from reversible to irreversible silencing, consistent with a role in the maintenance of X inactivation. The observation that recruitment of PRC2 and H3K27me3 is strictly dependent on Xist RNA and is reversible excludes PRC2 as a stable component of the memory. However, this finding is compatible with a role of PRC2 in memory establishment.
PcG complexes are thought to maintain a transcriptional memory for several developmental control genes in flies and mammals (Ringrose and Paro, 2004). It has been proposed that PRC2 recruits PRC1 based on the specificity of the chromodomain of Polycomb towards H3K27me3 (Fischle et al, 2003; Min et al, 2003). Eed is required for the maintenance of the paternal Xi exclusively in differentiating extraembryonic trophoblast cells (Wang et al, 2001). However, no defect in the maintenance of imprinted X inactivation has been observed in Eed mutant trophoblast stem cells or extraembryonic endoderm tissue, which lack H3K27me3 (Kalantry et al, 2006). In trophoblast stem cells, Eed is necessary for Xist RNA stabilisation and reactivation of the Xi is observed only after onset of differentiation. The function of Eed in the initiation of random X inactivation in embryonic cells has not been studied and its significance in the embryo proper remains unclear.
Here, we test the idea that PRC2 acts to recruit PRC1 in random X inactivation. Contrary to the expectation we find that Xist recruits the PRC1 protein Ring1b independent of H3K27me3 and Ring1b acts independently in the establishment of memory systems for the maintenance of X inactivation. This suggests that the present models for PcG complex recruitment in X inactivation need to be revised.
Results
Xist mediated H2A ubiquitination is regulated by a memory in differentiated cells and independent of gene silencing
Biochemically purified mammalian PRC1 consists of several PcG proteins, including Ring1b, and its histone H2A lysine 119 specific ubiquitination activity has been shown (de Napoles et al, 2004; Wang et al, 2004). To investigate the function of PRC1 in X inactivation we have elucidated the kinetics of H2AK119ub1 in ES cells containing an inducible Xist expression system (Figure 1A). In the clone 36 ES cell line, an Xist cDNA transgene under control of the doxycycline inducible promoter is inserted into chromosome 11, and recapitulates chromosome‐wide silencing (Wutz and Jaenisch, 2000). In ΔSX ES cells, the endogenous Xist locus has been modified by a targeted deletion of repeat A sequences of Xist, which are required for silencing, and concomitant introduction of an inducible promoter. This achieves inducible expression of a mutant Xist RNA, which does not cause gene silencing and thus circumvents the lethality associated with inactivation of the single X chromosome in this male ES cell line (Wutz et al, 2002). H2AK119ub1 was established rapidly upon Xist induction in undifferentiated clone 36 ES cells. Importantly, induction of the silencing‐deficient Xist RNA in ΔSX ES cells was also able to establish H2AK119ub1 on the chromosome (Figure 1B), indicating that H2AK119ub1 is not sufficient for gene silencing in X inactivation.
PRC1 recruitment by Xist. (A) Overview of the inducible Xist expression system (TetOP) on chromosome 11 and the X in clone 36 and ΔSX ES cells, respectively. In clone 36 ES cells, Xist induction silences a linked puromycin marker gene (puro). In ΔSX cells, the A repeat of Xist (triangle) is deleted. (B) Recruitment of the PRC1 components Ring1b and Mph1 as well as resulting H2AK119ub1 was observed by combined Xist RNA FISH (red) and immunofluorescence analysis (green) in undifferentiated ΔSX ES cells after 3 days Xist induction. (C) H2AK119ub1 is regulated by a chromosomal memory in differentiated cells. Bar graphs representing the percentage of nuclei with focal H2AK119ub1 signals (grey bars) and Xist RNA (white bars) is given (above). Error bars represent the standard deviation. Below a scheme of the ES cell differentiation time course showing the presence (black) or absence (white) of doxycycline. An asterisk marks the Xist induction scheme revealing the chromosomal memory. (D) Analysis of H3K27me3 in parallel cultures to (C).
We next studied the kinetics and stability of H2AK119ub1 during ES cell differentiation. We induced Xist starting at different time points in differentiating clone 36 ES cells and measured the levels of H2AK119ub1 and H3K27me3 at day 12 of differentiation (Figure 1C and D). In continuous presence of doxycycline, we detected a strong focal H2AK119ub1 signal in 69% of the nuclei, whereas no focus was observed if Xist was not induced. When Xist was turned off after 8 days of differentiation, focal H2AK119ub1 staining was observed in 7% of the cells on day 12 showing that H2AK119ub1 was reversible and Xist‐dependent during differentiation. Xist induction starting from day 4 in differentiation resulted in low levels of H2AK119ub1 (16%) at day 12 compared to cultures where induction had occurred early. Therefore, in differentiated cells Xist is not sufficient for efficient imposition of H2AK119ub1, suggesting that H2A ubiquitination could be regulated by a chromosomal memory similar to H3K27me3. To test this, we induced Xist expression during the first 4 days of differentiation in clone 36 ES cells, subsequently turned off Xist for 4 days by withdrawing doxycycline and then measured H2AK119ub1 levels after re‐induction of Xist for 4 more days. H2AK119ub1 staining was observed in 70% of these cells comparable to the percentage after 12 days of differentiation in continuous presence of doxycycline (Figure 1C). We conclude that Xist expression during an early time window in ES cell differentiation establishes a memory that is maintained independently of Xist. Reinduction of Xist in conjunction with this memory allows efficient H2AK119ub1 in differentiated cells. The recruitment of PRC1 mediated H2AK119ub1 therefore parallels the recruitment of PRC2 mediated H3K27me3 (Figure 1D) and could be a result of a dependency of PRC1 recruitment on H3K27me3.
Generation of ES cells lacking Eed
To directly investigate the function of the PRC2 complex in the recruitment of PRC1 at the initiation of X inactivation, we disrupted the Eed gene by targeting in clone 36 and ΔSX ES cells. The targeting vector replaced sequences encoding the first and second WD40 domains of the Eed protein with a stop cassette, which terminates transcription resulting in a null allele (Supplementary Figure 1A). After removal of the selection cassette from targeted ES clones by Cre‐recombinase mediated deletion, the second allele of Eed was targeted using the same strategy. This yielded the cell lines 36Eed−/− (clone 1 and 2) and ΔSXEed−/−, derivatives of clone 36 and ΔSX ES cells, respectively. Northern analysis confirmed the absence of wild‐type Eed transcripts in these cells (Figure 2A). Two truncated Eed RNA species were observed in Eed−/− ES cells consistent with the termination of transcription at the introduced stop cassette. Western analysis revealed that Eed protein was absent in the Eed−/− cell lines (Figure 2B), while in control clone 36 and ΔSX ES cell lines the four Eed isoforms were resolved. We further reconstituted Eed expression in 36Eed−/− (clone 2) ES cells by introducing a transgene expressing an amino terminal fusion of the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) with the short Eed isoform. In these 36EedTG ES cells, we observed one protein migrating with the expected molecular weight of the EGFP‐Eed fusion protein and a faster migrating product likely due to proteolysis (Figure 2B). In Eed deficient ES cells, Suz12 RNA levels were reduced whereas steady‐state levels of the Ezh2 transcripts remained unchanged compared to control cell lines (Figure 2A). Western analysis revealed that Ezh2 is drastically reduced below detection limit and Suz12 was found in reduced amount in Eed−/− cells (Figure 2B). In 36EedTG cells, Ezh2 and Suz12 RNA and protein levels were rescued confirming that the effect was specific and caused by the lack of Eed (Figure 2B, and data not shown).

DAPI (blue) stains DNA. Statistics of the number of nuclei showing colocalisation of Suz12 staining with Xist in 36 and 36Eed−/− ES cells. Error bars indicate standard deviation (n>600).
Eed deficient 36Eed−/− and ΔSXEed−/− ES cells showed a reduced ability to form colonies compared to control 36 and ΔSX ES cells but proliferation and self‐renewal of ES cells was largely independent of Eed (Supplementary Figure 1B and C). Furthermore, the plating efficiency is rescued in 36EedTG ES cells showing that the defect is specific and due to lack of Eed. Eed−/− ES cells could be induced to differentiate with retinoic acid, but showed a reduced developmental potential indicated by the formation of irregular shaped embroid bodies and the absence of contractile structures indicative of cardiomyocytes in embroid body outgrowths (Supplementary Figure 1D and E, and data not shown).
Xist recruits Suz12 independent of functional PRC2
Western analysis of Eed deficient ES cells revealed reduced Suz12 protein levels compared to control 36 ES cells and a loss of Ezh2 protein (Figure 2B). This was verified by combined immunofluorescence Xist RNA fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) analysis on ES cells, after 3 days of Xist induction with doxycycline. In control clone 36 ES cells, 89, 79 and 88% of cells showed colocalisation of Xist RNA with Eed, Ezh2 and Suz12, respectively (Figure 2C–E; Table I). In Eed deficient 36Eed−/− ES cells Xist RNA showed normal localisation and no signal for Eed and Ezh2 was detected consistent with the loss of these proteins (Figure 2C and D). The Suz12 signal was markedly decreased in Eed deficient cells. However, we observed colocalisation of Suz12 with Xist RNA in 13 and 7% of 36Eed−/− clone 1 and clone 2 ES cells, respectively (Figure 2E). This demonstrates that recruitment of Suz12 by Xist RNA can occur, at least in part, independent of Ezh2 and Eed suggesting a role for Suz12 in PRC2 recruitment in X inactivation.
Xist recruits PRC1 independent of Eed and H3K27me3 in ES cells
To study the chromosomal marks at the initiation of X inactivation in Eed deficient ES cells, we performed combined Xist RNA FISH immunofluorescence analysis on 36Eed−/− and control ES cells (Figure 3 and Table I). After Xist induction for 3 days, we observed a strong focal H3K27me3 staining colocalising with Xist RNA in clone 36 ES cells. However, in 36Eed−/− ES cells di‐ and tri‐methylation of H3K27 were drastically reduced and no colocalisation with Xist was observed consistent with a loss of PRC2 function in these cells (Figure 3B and C). A faint H3K27me3 signal was still observed at pericentric heterochromatin possibly due to weak cross‐reactivity of the antibody with H4K20me3 (Peters et al, 2003). We detected a robust H3K27me1 signal at pericentric heterochromatin in 36Eed−/− cells comparable to controls (Figure 3A). In 36EedTG ES cells transgenic expression of EGFP‐Eed rescued H3K27me3 (Supplementary Figure 1F).

(G) Mass‐spectrometric analysis of histone H3 lysine 27 methylation in clone 36, 36Eed−/− and 36EedTG ES cells. The percentage of the indicated modification state is given for three independent experiments; error bars indicate standard deviation.
H2AK119ub1 and H4K20me1 are two marks associated with the initiation of X inactivation. H2AK119ub1 colocalised with Xist RNA in 97 and 98% of clone 36 and 36Eed−/− ES cells, respectively (Figure 3E). A robust H4K20me1 signal colocalising with Xist RNA was detectable in 82% control clone 36 ES cells. In 36Eed−/− ES cells, the H4K20me1 signal appeared less intense and was detected in 50% (clone 1) and 36% (clone 2) cells (Figure 3D). We conclude that ubiquitination of H2A on lysine 119 is independent of Eed, but PRC2 function supports the establishment of H4K20me1 by Xist (Table I).
We observed normal H2A ubiquitination upon Xist expression in Eed deficient cells, which in ES cells is thought to be mediated by Ring1b, a core component of PRC1 (Figure 3E). To assess if PRC1 was indeed recruited by Xist independent of PRC2, we performed immunofluorescence analysis using antisera specific for the PRC1 core components Ring1b, Mph1 and Mph2. Colocalisation of Ring1b with Xist RNA was observed in ES cells independent of Eed (Figure 4A). The Mph1 signal colocalised with Xist in 48% of control 36 ES cells, but no colocalisation was observed in 36Eed−/− ES cells (Figure 4B). Colocalisation of Mph2 with Xist RNA was observed only in differentiated cells (Figure 4C), and was detected in 33% of clone 36 but not in Eed deficient 36Eed−/− ES cells on day 8 of differentiation. We conclude that recruitment of Mph1 and Mph2 by Xist is dependent on PRC2 function, but Ring1b is recruited independently of PRC2, Mph1 and Mph2. Despite the lack of detectable Mph1 and Mph2 recruitment, the Ring1b protein is enzymatically active as shown by ubiquitination of H2A.

PRC2 is critical for H3K27me2 and H3K27me3 in ES cells
To assess if disruption of Eed in 36Eed−/− and ΔSXEed−/− ES cells indeed caused a loss of PRC2 function, we performed an analysis of histone modifications. By Western analysis H3K27me2 and H3K27me3 were lost in 36Eed−/− and ΔSXEed−/− ES cells, but we found mono‐methylation of H3K27 only slightly reduced consistent with our immunofluorescence data (Figure 3F). The mono‐, di‐ and tri‐methylation states of histone H3 lysine 9 or of H4 lysine 20, and ubiquitination of histone H2A lysine 119 were not altered in Eed deficient ES cells (data not shown).
To further quantify the histone methylation marks, we performed a mass spectrometric analysis of nuclear extracts prepared from undifferentiated 36Eed−/− and ΔSXEed−/− and control ES cells. In control 36 ES cells, 17% of bulk histone H3 were mono‐methylated, 58% di‐methylated and 14% tri‐methylated on lysine 27 (Figure 3G) consistent with previous reports (Peters et al, 2003). In Eed deficient ES cells, H3K27me3 and H3K27me2 were dramatically reduced compared to controls, but only a moderate reduction in the H3K27me1 signal was observed (Figure 3G). The loss of H3K27 di‐ and tri‐methylation in Eed deficient ES cells resulted in a concomitant increase in unmodified but not mono‐methylated H3K27. Di‐ and tri‐methylation of H3K27 was restored in 36EedTG ES cells to 42 and 7%, corresponding to 72 and 50% of wild‐type levels, respectively (Figure 3G). The methylation levels of H3K9 or H4K20 were unchanged by the absence of Eed (Supplementary Figures 2B and 3). However, H3K36me2 levels were significantly reduced from 50% in control clone 36 ES cells to 34% in 36Eed−/− ES cells, and 31% in ΔSXEed−/− ES cells (Supplementary Figures 2A and 5). Restoration of H3K36me2 levels in 36EedTG to 43% demonstrated that the PRC2 complex regulates global H3K36me2 marks.
We conclude that in ES cells PRC2 is crucial for H3K27 di‐ and tri‐methylation, but has no detectable contribution to H3K9 methylation. The H3K27me1 mark on pericentric heterochromatin was unaffected in Eed deficient ES cells (Figure 3A).
Initiation of silencing by Xist is independent of PRC2
In clone 36 ES cells inducible Xist expression causes reversible silencing of a puromycin resistance gene, which was cointegrated with the Xist cDNA transgene on chromosome 11 (Wutz and Jaenisch, 2000). To establish whether Eed is required for initiation of silencing, we induced Xist expression in 36Eed−/− ES cells for 3 days and analysed puromycin resistance gene expression by Northern (Figure 5A). Silencing was equally efficient in control 36, 36EedTG and Eed deficient ES cells, demonstrating that Eed and H3K27me3 are dispensable for initiation of silencing by Xist.

Means of three independent measurements normalised to Gapdh are shown, error bars represent standard deviation. Scheme on the left shows the genes relative to the Xist transgene.
To investigate the role of Eed for the maintenance of silencing, we induced Xist in differentiating 36Eed−/− and control 36 ES cells. In retinoic acid differentiated cells in the presence of doxycycline for 8 days or for 4 days followed by 4 days without Xist induction, we observed efficient maintenance of silencing of the puromycin gene compared to cultures, in which Xist had not been induced (Figure 5B). Notably, there was no difference between Eed deficient 36Eed−/− and control 36 ES cells demonstrating that the shift from reversible to irreversible gene silencing had occurred in the absence of PRC2 function. To test the function of Eed for the maintenance of silencing in a more physiological differentiation model, we established embryoid body outgrowth cultures from Eed deficient 36Eed−/− and control 36 ES cells in the presence or absence of doxycycline and measured expression of the puromycine marker gene after 4 weeks of differentiation. Northern analysis revealed that silencing was maintained in the absence of Eed (Figure 5C). Finally to establish that long‐range silencing was maintained as opposed to merely silencing of the marker gene in proximity of the Xist transgene, we established differentiated cultures by induction with retinoic acid and measured expression of genes on chromosome 11 by quantitative PCR analysis. The Npm1 gene, which is located 20 Mb from the transgene integration site, was repressed by Xist on day 8 of differentiation in 36Eed−/− as well as in control cells to approximately 50%. Npm1 repression was also maintained in cells that were differentiated in the presence of doxycycline for 4 days followed by 4 days without (Figure 5D). The repression of three other genes Cct4, Igf2b1 and Tk1 in differentiated cells showed the same trend but was more variable, probably because of heterogeneous regulation in the differentiated cultures. We conclude that Eed is not required for the initiation of Xist mediated silencing, and that PRC2 function and H3K27me3 are dispensable for the maintenance of long‐range silencing.
Memory recruitment for H2AK119ub1 is independent of PRC2 function
We observed that H2AK119ub1 is regulated by a chromosomal memory in differentiated cells. To investigate whether this memory would be established in Eed deficient ES cells and could still contribute in this context to Xist‐mediated silencing, we analysed the establishment of H2AK119ub1 in Eed deficient 36Eed−/− (clone 1 and 2) and ΔSXEed−/− ES cells (Figure 6A). The latter express a mutant Xist RNA that does not cause transcriptional repression, thus allowing us to follow memory establishment on an active chromosome. In all ES cell lines, Xist expression at early differentiation enabled efficient H2AK119ub1 at later time points comparable to control clone 36 ES cells (Figures 1C and 6A). We induced Xist expression for 4 days beginning at the start of differentiation, followed by withdrawal of doxycycline for 4 days. After this Xist RNA and H2AK119ub1 had been lost from the chromosome and then Xist expression was re‐induced for 4 more days. In these cells we observed efficient re‐ubiquitination (70, 59, 60 and 31% in 36, 36Eed−/− clone 1, 36Eed−/− clone 2 and ΔSXEed−/− ES cells, respectively). This is comparable to cells, which were differentiated in continuous presence of doxycycline (69, 61, 58 and 41%). Importantly, efficient re‐establishment of H2AK119ub1 was observed in differentiated ΔSXEed−/− ES cells and was therefore independent of silencing. In contrast, Xist induction starting at day 4 in differentiation resulted in focal H2AK119ub1 staining in a low percentage of cells (16, 19, 22 and 17%). Moreover, when Xist expression was turned off by withdrawing doxycycline from the medium H2AK119ub1 was lost from the chromosome at all time points examined in ES cell differentiation (Figure 6, and data not shown). We conclude that Xist expression establishes a chromosomal memory independent of Eed and gene silencing suggesting a possible explanation for maintenance of X inactivation in Eed deficient embryonic cells.

Discussion
PRC1 recruitment in X inactivation is strictly dependent on Xist RNA
Using an inducible Xist expression system we have analysed the recruitment of PRC1 function in X inactivation. We find that Xist recruits Ring1b and concomitant H2AK119ub1 independent of transcriptional silencing. Recruitment of Polycomb complexes has been associated with heritable silencing of genes (Ringrose and Paro, 2004). We find that PRC1 and PRC2 also associate in the absence of gene silencing with the chromosome expressing Xist. Polycomb recruitment alone is therefore not sufficient for transcriptional repression in X inactivation. This is consistent with data in the fly where loading of PcG proteins onto Polycomb response elements (PREs) precedes the silencing of developmental control genes (Orlando et al, 1998). Polycomb binding and H3K27me3 on PREs has been observed independent of silencing (Ringrose et al, 2004) and loss of dRING function leads to derepression of genes despite of persistence of H3K27me3 (Wang et al, 2004). Alternatively, coordinate loading of PcG complexes on the promoter and a PRE could be required for repression. It is tempting to speculate that in X inactivation Xist repeat A acts as a signal to repress gene expression, thereby enabling recruitment of promoters to the PcG territory of the chromosome. In ΔSX ES cells, promoters would then be predicted not to associate with the repressive PcG territory established by the silencing deficient Xist RNA lacking repeat A.
We find that PRC1 recruitment is dependent on Xist RNA localisation and is reversible throughout ES cell differentiation when Xist is turned off. From this we conclude that PRC1 is not stable once loaded onto the chromosome, but depends on Xist and a chromosomal memory. Consistent with this, dynamic turnover of PRC1 has been observed on chromatin in the fly (Ringrose et al, 2004; Ficz et al, 2005). In striking contrast to the fly, where noncoding RNA transcription over PREs has been associated with gene activation (Schmitt et al, 2005; Sanchez‐Elsner et al, 2006), in X inactivation the noncoding Xist RNA is associated with the repressed state. This suggests different mechanisms for Polycomb loading in the fly and in X inactivation and demonstrates a novel strictly RNA dependent recruitment mode for mammalian PRC1.
H2AK119ub1 activity of PRC1 does not require Mph1 or Mph2
Using Eed‐deficient ES cells we show that the recruitment of the PRC1 core proteins Mph1 and Mph2 by Xist is dependent on Eed. This observation is consistent with the idea that PRC2 has a recruitment function for PRC1 components. A fly PRC1 core complex has been reconstituted containing the four components Psc, Pc, Ph and dRing (Francis et al, 2001). A similar composition has been proposed for mammalian PRC1 like complexes based on purification and reconstitution experiments (Lavigne et al, 2004; Wang et al, 2004). However, we observe in Eed deficient ES cells that Ring1b is not only recruited by Xist in the absence of the PRC1 core components Mph1 and Mph2 but also appears to be functional as demonstrated by the concomitant ubiquitination of lysine 119 on histone H2A. Thus, in X inactivation Ring1b is either functional alone and can be recruited independently of other PRC1 members by Xist, or is part of a distinct complex that is yet to be identified (Ogawa et al, 2002; Dou et al, 2005; Isono et al, 2005b).
Based on our data we therefore propose two mechanisms for recruitment of PRC1 function by Xist in X inactivation (Figure 6b). A PRC2 dependent mode involves the binding of the Polycomb chromodomain to the H3K27me3 mark and operates via Mph1 or Mph2. This is predicted from biochemical evidence that H3K27me3 acts as a affinity signal recognised by the chromodomain of mammalian homologues of Polycomb (Fischle et al, 2003; Min et al, 2003). Our data provide evidence for a second mode of recruitment for PRC1 function. In the absence of PRC2 function, Xist can recruit Ring1b independent of the PRC1 core proteins Mph1 or Mph2. Both recruitment modes for PRC1 by Xist act synergistically to mediate H2AK119ub1 in the initiation of X inactivation.
Ring1b and PRC2 are regulated by a chromosomal memory
Establishment of H2AK119ub1 is restricted to an early time window in ES cell differentiation such that little H2AK119ub1 is imposed if Xist is induced at late time points in ES cell differentiation. Thus, Xist expression during an early window in differentiation establishes a chromosomal memory that in differentiated cells is required for H2AK119ub1. This memory is established at the time when X inactivation becomes irreversible and is stably maintained independent of Xist expression. To date, the molecular nature of this chromosomal memory is unknown. Our data demonstrate that the memory regulating the imposition of H2AK119ub1 and H3K27me3 in differentiated cells is independent of silencing. Recruitment of both PRC1 and PRC2 is also dependent on Xist RNA localisation and both histone marks are lost from the chromosome when Xist is turned off. Hence, H2AK119ub1 and H3K27me3 are reversible modifications and depend on Xist expression. We conclude that PRC1 and PRC2 are not stably maintained on the Xi throughout ES cell differentiation and can be excluded as integral components of the memory. Yet, the recruitment of PcG proteins early in X inactivation is consistent with a role in the establishment of a special chromatin structure that functions as chromosomal memory. Importantly, our data demonstrate that once established this chromatin structure is self‐perpetuating and stable in the absence of Xist, PRC1 and PRC2. We show that a chromosomal memory regulating H2AK119ub1 is established independent of PRC2, Mph1 and Mph2.
Eed and H3K27me3 are not crucial for X inactivation in embryonic cells
Disruption of Eed in ES cells caused a lack Eed and Ezh2 protein and reduced levels of Suz12 consistent with earlier reports (Pasini et al, 2004; Montgomery et al, 2005). In the absence of Eed the levels of Ezh2 protein, which contains the catalytically active SET domain required for PRC2 histone methylase function, are reduced below detection. This could be the result of impaired translation or enhanced turnover of Ezh2 protein in the absence of Eed. In support of this notion, the disruption of PRC2 function in Eed deficient ES cells is clearly demonstrated by the loss of H3K27me3 in Eed deficient ES cells. Interestingly, we find that Xist RNA can recruit Suz12 independent of a functional PRC2 complex. Suz12 is a core component of the biochemically purified PRC2 complex, suggesting that PRC2 might be recruited at least in part via Suz12 in X inactivation. Consistent with this Suz12 also has roles in position effect variegation in fly and thus can act independent of PRC2 (Birve et al, 2001).
Western, immunofluorescence and mass spectrometric analyses show that disruption of PRC2 function leads to a specific loss of di‐ and tri‐ but not mono‐methylation of H3K27 in vivo without affecting global levels of H3K9 methylation. This finding is consistent with and extends data from Suz12 deficient embryos (Pasini et al, 2004). Notably, the H3K27me1 marks at pericentric heterochromatin are not affected by loss of PRC2 function consistent with an independent regulation. In ES cells, Xist expression leads to rapid establishment of H3K27me3 along the chromosome, which requires PRC2 function. From mass spectrometric data we obtained a rough estimate that induction of Xist causes an approximately seven‐fold increase in H3K27me3. Such an increase would require that 90% of the nucleosomes of the Xist expressing chromosome are tri‐methylated on H3 lysine 27, compared to 14% total nuclear average (Supplementary Figure 2; Peters et al, 2003). Given that in bulk chromatin 60% of histone H3 is di‐methylated on lysine 27, the effect of Xist is a shift from di‐ to a tri‐methyl marks that could provide increased affinity for PRC1. Our observation that recruitment of Mph1 and Mph2 by Xist is abolished in the absence of PRC2 supports this view.
Reactivation of the paternal Xi was observed previously in differentiating trophoblast stem cells in Eed deficient embryos, indicating a role for PRC2 in maintenance of X inactivation (Wang et al, 2001). However, maintenance of the Xi in trophoblast stem cells and extraembryonic endoderm is not affected by a mutation in Eed (Kalantry et al, 2006). Imprinted X inactivation is initiated very early in embryogenesis and a maternal contribution of Eed could possibly function early in the initiation of imprinted X inactivation in Eed mutant embryos. Using Eed deficient ES cells, we can rule out PRC2 function at the initiation of Xist mediated silencing in embryonic cells. Xist expression in ES cells lacking functional PRC2 fails to establish H3K27me3 and recruit Mph1 and Mph2. However, in the absence of Eed, stable X inactivation can still be achieved. This unexpected finding suggests that functionally redundant mechanisms compensate for the loss of PRC2 function to maintain Xist mediated silencing in ES cell differentiation. PRC1 and PRC2 function independently in gene regulation as indicated by the requirement of both Eed and Ring1b for embryonic development (Wang et al, 2002; Voncken et al, 2003). Our data show that Ring1b can be recruited by Xist independent of PRC2. This recruitment of PRC1 function provides a likely explanation for the lack of an obvious defect on Xi maintenance in Eed deficient embryonic cells. This is in contrast to PRC2 action in the regulation of other genes, where a recruitment function of PRC2 is essential (Zhang et al, 2004). The requirement of PRC2 for recruitment of some PRC1 components is also observed in X inactivation as Xist is unable to recruit Mph1 and Mph2 in the absence of Eed. In conclusion, we find that Xist can establish a chromatin structure that mediates a chromosomal memory in X inactivation independent of PRC2, suggesting the masking of a more dramatic defect in the maintenance of X inactivation in Eed deficient cells by an PRC2 independent mechanism for recruitment of PRC1 function by Xist. Future studies will be directed to establish the interplay between transcriptional silencing and the PcG complex mediated chromosomal memory during X inactivation.
Materials and methods
Cell culture and generation of ES cell lines
ES cells were cultured as described previously (Wutz and Jaenisch, 2000). Xist expression was induced by the addition of 1 μg/ml of doxycycline. Differentiation medium contained 100 nM all‐trans‐retinoic acid and no LIF. Embryoid bodies were generated by the hanging drop method in medium without LIF. After 2 days aggregates were pooled and cultured in suspension for 3 days and subsequently plated on gelatin‐coated culture dishes for 3 weeks. Cell numbers were determined using a Casy 1 cell counter (Schaerfe System GmbH, Germany).
For construction of the Eed targeting vector, a 12 kb XhoI–ClaI genomic fragment was subcloned from a BAC isolated from the RPCII22 129 mouse BAC library (CHORI). The 2.8 kb SacI–EcoRI fragment containing three exons coding for WD40 domains 1 and 2 of the Eed protein were replaced by a stop cassette containing the adenoviral splice acceptor and polyadenylation signal separated by a loxP‐flanked hygromycin‐thymidine kinase selection cassette. Finally, a diphtheria toxin A chain cassette was inserted for counter selection of random insertions (see Figure 1B). Targeted clones were identified after selection with Hygromycin B (130 μg/ml) by Southern analysis of EcoRV digested DNA using probe pEed by a 12 kb band (wild‐type band runs at 23 kb). The targeting frequency was between 17 and 37%. After Cre recombinase mediated excision of the selection cassette, the second allele was targeted using the same strategy yielding Eed−/− cells. For pCAG–EGFP‐Eed‐IREShygPA the short Eed isoform, corresponding to the human isoform 3 (Kuzmichev et al, 2004), was tagged with EGFP at the N‐terminus and cloned into pCAG‐IREShygPA. 36Eed−/− clone 2 ES cells were electroporated with 50 μg of pCAG‐EGFP‐Eed‐IREShygPA to generate 36EedTG cells.
Immunostaining and RNA FISH
ES cells were attached to poly‐l‐lysine coated coverslips or cytospun using a Cytospin 3 centrifuge (Thermo Shandon, USA). Differentiated cells were grown on Roboz slides (CellPoint Scientific, USA). Immunostaining was performed as described (Peters et al, 2003; Kohlmaier et al, 2004). Briefly, cells were fixed for 10 min at RT in 4% PFA in PBS, permeabilised for 5 min at RT in 0.1% Na Citrate/0.1% Triton X‐100, blocked for 60 min at RT in PBS containing 5% (wt/vol) BSA, 0.1% Tween‐20. For H2AK119ub1 immunostaining cells were pre‐extracted in 100 mM NaCl, 300 mM sucrose, 3 mM MgCl2, 10 mM Pipes pH 6.8 and 0.5% Triton for 2 min at RT before fixation.
RNA FISH probes were generated by random priming (Stratagene, USA) using Cy3‐dCTP (Amersham). After immunostaining, cells were fixed in 4% PFA in PBS for 10 min at 4°C, de‐hydrated, hybridised and washed as described (Wutz and Jaenisch, 2000). Images were obtained using a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss Axioplan) equipped with a CCD camera and the MetaMorph image analysis software (Universal Imaging, USA).
RNA and protein analysis
Northern analysis was performed using 20 μg of RNA (Trizol; Invitrogen) as described previously (Wutz and Jaenisch, 2000). Antibodies for histone lysine methylation states and Western analysis were previously described (Peters et al, 2003; Kohlmaier et al, 2004) and the following dilutions were used (immunostaining/Western blot): α‐H3K9m1 (#4858, 1:1000/1:500); α‐H3K9m2 (#4677, 1:1000/1:1000); α‐H3K9m3 (#4861, 1:750/1:1000); α‐H3K27m1 (#8835, 1:6,000/1:1000); α‐H3K27m2 (#8841, 1:1000/1:2,000); α‐H3K27m3 (#6523, 1:1000/1:7,000); α‐H4K20m1 (#0077, 1:500/1:3,000); α‐H4K20m2 (#0080, 1:1000/1:1000); α‐H4K20m3 (#0083, 1:3,000/1:3,000). Additional antibodies were as follows: α‐H2AK119ub1 (α‐ubiquityl‐Histone H2A, clone E6C5; #05‐678 Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, New York, USA), 1:50/1:400; α‐Suz12 (# 07‐379; Upstate), 1:1000/1:1000; α‐Eed (rabbit polyclonal antiserum, AKS and AW, unpublished results); 1:1000 α‐Ezh2 (rabbit polyclonal antiserum, M Busslinger unpublished results); 1:1000/1:1000); α‐Ring1b (Atsuta et al, 2001), 1:100 for IF; α‐Mph1 (Isono et al, 2005a), 1:5 for IF; α‐Mph2 (Isono et al, 2005a), 1:100 for IF; α‐hnRNP A1 (4B10 mouse monoclonal antiserum), 1:1000 for Western.

on a ABI PRISM 7000 detection machine was performed in triplicate as described (Pauler et al, 2005). Quantification was achieved by the standard curve method using serial dilutions of cDNA generated from uninduced ES cells at day 8 of differentiation. Samples were normalised to Gapdh and the expression levels of uninduced clone 36 ES cells at day 8 of differentiation were set to 100 for each gene.
Nuclear extracts and mass spectrometry
ES cell cultures where harvested by trypsination and feeders were removed by plating on cell culture dishes twice for 30 min. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described (Peters et al, 2003). For mass spectrometry 20 μg of nuclear extracts were separated by 15% SDS–PAGE and bands containing histone H3 and H4 were excised after Coomassie staining. Processing of the samples and quantitative mass spectrometric analyses were carried out as described (Peters et al, 2003).

After becoming official in the courthouse, over 60 children and their new forever families got a party at the Harris County Juvenile Justice Center.
There were games and music to celebrate this big milestone.
"You can tell when people walk in, they've been family for months already. Today is just the day they're making it official, and they're becoming forever families," said Tiffani Butler of Texas Department of Family and Protective Services.
Officials say more than 700 children still do not have potential families. If you're interested in adopting or fostering, you can visit adoptchildren.org for more information.

I was totally determined to stop by one of Cat Cafes while I was visiting my parents this time. My husband and I had only eight days to spare in this trip to do everything we wanted to do, including spending time with my parents and friends, eating delicious meals everyday, a short trip to a very nice and relaxing onsen ryokan (a traditional inn with a natural hot spring bath), shopping for small size clothes, AND going to Cat Café for the first time in my life!
As I introduced Cat Café phenomenon before, it is a business that serves people who cannot have cats at home who want to have a relaxing and fun time with the cats at the café. They are usually in big cities. I found one called “Cat Street”, in Nagoya, where we had to take multiple trains for 90 min. each way. That is life in Japan – I don’t miss it at all. I cannot believe that I did that commute via trains every single day for seven years working for a bank in Nagoya. Well, I was early 20’s back then… not anymore.
The Cat Street was in the middle of the downtown Nagoya where many shopping and commercial buildings are on top of each other, and many small trucks, cars, motorcycles, and bicycles were crossing the streets. My first thought was, “What a pity! The cats could never enjoy outside life here.” On the first floor of the building was a reception area. We took off our shoes, and were asked to wear a pair of brand new guest socks to enter the cat area on the second floor.
There they were!! The first kitty that greeted us excitedly was a little orange tabby, Lask. We were asked not playing with him using our hands. The lady told us that he was under training not to scratch/bite people. There were about 13 cats on the second floor space. In that space, there were about five low tables with seats. We were assigned to one of the tables, and there was a booklet of “What to do/not to do with the cats” manual on it. There was a complimentary drinking station to self-serve many soft drinks, coffee, and tea. The lady explained to us that the first 30min. is 700 yen (about 7 US dollars). Then, after that, it is 500 yen ($5) per another 30min.
Jeffrey and I couldn’t waste our time there – we needed a “kitty-fix” since my parents live without cats! While Jeffrey was playing with young crazy teenager cats, my cat radar was going towards older, rather bored cats. There was a beautiful fluffy white cat nearby, and she was half-sleeping, or pretended being sleepy – so that, I
wouldn’t bother her. And, no, I didn’t bother her. Soon after, I went to this pretty grey tabby named Yomogi (green vegetable plants used in Japanese sweets). She was at first hesitating to getting to know me, but after five minutes sniffing around me, she was just fine. She enjoyed scratching her cheeks, forehead, and back. Purrrr… that was a “kitty-fix” for sure! I walked around to take some pictures and to interact with other kitties. Overall, they were all mellow and settled. I was glad to see many shelves and cat condos for cats to climb up to and clean water fountains. I didn’t see any dry food sitting there. I think there is a feeding schedule. The place was very clean and organized as it should be anywhere in Japan! 🙂
At the end of the visit, I had a short conversation with the lady who takes care of Cat Street. She told me that all the cats were purchased from breeders, and the cats are owned by Cat Street. Even when someone wants to adopt the cat, it could be arranged, but adoption is not the purpose of the Cat Café – my assumption was wrong. Also, I found out that these cats go to individual cages at night after closing time at 8 pm until next morning.
I felt sad for the cats who would live their entire lives there in the building facing the busy streets in a big city! They cannot have any outside activities. Well, I had to rationalize that the Cat Café as a purely business to serve humans, and not cats. If I would do something like that, I would love to have cats to be adopted to a better place to live with caring permanent human companions. Plus, I would make sure they have daily access to an enclosed and protected outside play area. Cats look so happy to be outside jumping, running, and sleeping under a warm sun. Hey, that is not too bad as a new business idea?!Smart motorways dangerous for recovery workers
As well as the Right Honourable Sir Mike Penning MP, well-known motoring journalist Quentin Wilson made the case in support of PROF and its roadside safety objectives
One key outcome of the establishment of both PROF and the Roadside Rescue and Recovery APPG is that Sir Mike Penning committed to reviewing the safety of so-called “smart motorways”. His speech within the houses of Parliament at the launch of PROF saw the Sir Mike admit the information he had when he was one of the MPs that signed off on smart motorways did not reflect the correct situation.
One of the key differences is the distance between recovery bays, which has steadily increase between the planning and implementation stages of smart motorway roll-out. And because smart motorways have effectively replaced hundreds of miles of hard shoulder, this has a direct impact on the safety of those working at the roadside.
In response to this point, it must be said that smart motorways can display a red cross above a closed lane, many drivers ignore this and it is not easy to get Highways Agency approval for a lane closure.
Therefore, as well as well welcoming the review of smart motorways in general, PROF is lobbying the APPG and government in general regarding allowing the use of flashing read lights on recovery vehicles in order to increase their visibilities on increasingly busy roads. Red lights also distinguish recovery vehicles from the many amber-lit cones and often amber smart motorway matrix signs.

When I think of Martinsville, Va., I imagine shivering and blowing on my hands. It’s bound to rain, most likely a drizzle, sometime during the weekend, whether spring or fall.
I see stern officers of the law, wearing flat-brimmed tan hats, in uniforms more likely to display forest green and brown to set off the tan. Navy is less common in the attire of southern Virginia deputies.
I see fans who are working people, wearing wool, flannel shirts, laced-up boots and stocking caps.
I never spent a night in Martinsville. For 20 years and 40 races, my home away from home was a motel in Eden, N.C., that had three different names during the years I wrote about the nearby races. All that mattered to me was that I could check out on Monday and tell the nice lady with the ruby on her forehead that I would be back for the next race. For the last 10 years, I stayed in the same room.
All I ever did was sleep there.
I took more racing excursions around Martinsville than any other track. All I required was companionship, either from Jim McLaurin or Rick Minter, for a trip east to South Boston, Va., for pavement, or southwest to Madison, N.C., for dirt. McLaurin and I met Tony Stewart in Madison (311 Motor Speedway, “the Daytona of the Dirt!”). Minter and I watched teen-aged Austin and Ty Dillon race at 311 from the top of Richard Childress’s hauler in the infield.
The best race I ever saw Stewart run was a USAC midget race at South Boston.
Four or five of us drove over to Stuart, Va., home of the Wood Brothers, one year, not to tour the museum, though I have done that, but to watch a pro-wrestling show at the local high school. We watched men, women and midgets, mostly separated by size and gender except during periods of widespread lawlessness.
At other tracks, we might play golf. Or go to a ballgame. Or tour a museum. Or see a show.
In Martinsville, we watched ’rasslin’, ordered hamburger steaks at Clarence’s, drank beer and ate prime rib at the Dutch Inn and enjoyed Dog Nutz (“beer-battered chunks of weenie!”) at Jose’s (“Shiloh’s Finest Supper Club”).
Minter and I had a wondrous shortcut to the track from Eden that was a scenic and soul-stirring way to get there. Sometimes Minter used some of the saved time – we encountered almost no traffic – to visit a yard sale on race morning.
Martinsville was country-boy fun. I expect it still is.
It’s likely to rain all day Friday, but the weekend figures to be cool and crisp. Perfect.
I love Darlington more than any other track, but I might miss Martinsvile more. It’s a tough call.Apartment in Son Servera

wami Rama was one of the foremost Yogis in this century to go to west and Spread the roots of Spirituality.
When Swami Rama was small child, the Astrologers prepared his Horoscope and told his parents that he will die at the age of 28. Hearing this bad news, Swami Rama, then a child, started crying.
Suddenly from no where, A Saint came to his house and said “Son, you don’t worry, I will take care of you and you are not going to die”. That Saint was none other than his own Guru.
After some years Swami Rama left home to join his Guru and forgot completely about the prediction of astrologers.
His Guru asked him to go to many Great Sages and through them Swami Rama became aware of many esoteric secrets and Powerful Mantras of many traditions.
Swami Rama used to love wandering in Himalayas. One day he was Climbing a Difficult Hill and suddenly he slipped and Lost Control.
Falling down the Mountain, he was stopped barely at the edge of a cliff when his belly was pierced by a wild shrub and now his Body was hanging from the Cliff.
Blood was coming out and Swami Rama’s life was in danger. In Desperation, Swami Rama tried all the powerful Mantras but nothing worked. Each passing moment Death was coming closer.
After trying every thing Swami Rama thought “I have tried every thing except my Guru, Let him also give a Chance”. Swami Rama prayed to his Guru for help.
Instantly help came in the form of Village woman’s who were passing above that Cliff. These women’s noticed Swami Rama hanging between life and death and they helped Swami Rama back to safety.

Me and my photography, located in Budapest: my "journey" started for almost twenty years ago, when I was strongly affected by traveling all over the world. I've shot primarily hotels and buildings on request, made my own travel photos with enthusiasm and published some guidebooks about Thailand, Greece, Bali and Malaysia etc. Nowadays I lead my own publishing company and Photography became my profession and so my persistent subject of infatuation. I constantly develop my facture and try to let my own style recognizable especially in the areas of portrait, nude and street photography. My projects also include an album about Venice with my own way of seeing and capturing things.
Biography
József Tóth was born in 1970, in Budapest. His passion towards photography has already shown itself in his childhood. Already in his younger years, he learnt the technical bases of photography. He made his first black and white photos with an analogue camera and then developed them in his own darkroom. He was especially fascinated by realistic image representation; billboards were made out of his works and published across the country, having become sought after primarily because of his unique way of seeing things. Apart from the harmonious, accurate description, his photos of buildings were characterized by a unique depiction of lights, structures and shapes. His photos made during his travels, raised the interest of many Hungarian and foreign travel agencies; this way, in the course of the years, a number of journals of magazines in the area of travelling published his materials.
Besides the building and travel images, later the artist experimented in the area of street photography, as well as portray and fashion photography, similarly with great success. In the recent 12 years, he made excellent photo illustrations for a number of books and albums.
Keeping photography as a creative way of self-expression, since 2002, József Tóth is the manager of a company engaged in book publishing and press works, which is also closely linked to his previous activities. He has designed and created more than 80 books and uncountable press products. Clients ordering the most versatile press services all over Europe witness the precise and reliable work of his company, whether it is organizing exhibitions, graphical design of travel brochures and company images, or preparation of promotional materials.
Since the mid ‘90s, not a single year has passed without him visiting Venice, Italy. In the past few years, they have already portrayed the city’s beauty together with his wife, Kíra Kenéz, and the result of their work are several tens of thousands of brilliant photos and post cards from Venice, as well as an extraordinary artistic publication that came out in 2012 with the title “Postcards from Venice”. The artist sees the city almost as his second home, so it is not a coincidence that his first significant exhibition was organized here, in the luxurious building of Scuola Grande di San Teodoro.Our what your will learn.

This O2 sensor feedback is stored as short-term fuel trims (STFT) and long-term fuel trims (LTFT) and tells the PCM how much fuel it needs to add or subtract to achieve stoichiometric air-fuel (A:F) ratio.
The LTFTs are generally positive values in a V which means the PCM is adding X% of fuel to meet the desired A:F. Depending on the weather, gasoline, altitude, temperature, modifications, etc., the PCM will self-learn to a limit of 13% before tripping a diagnostic trouble code (DTC) for either too lean or too rich. The LTFTs are just that - long term and are slowly updated over time and is something one would have a hard time noticing.
Driving in steady state, any V with nearly any traditional bolt-on modification will be running at the perfect 14.7:1 stoichiometric A:F. The O2 sensor feedback and resulting LTFTs will make sure of that.
So if the STFTs and LTFTs make sure the A:F is right under steady state, why would anyone need a tune? The answer: since positive fuel trims are the norm, under wide-open-throttle (WOT) the PCM says "Ah, my stored factory maps are lean and under normal driving I've had to add fuel (from the + LTFTs) so I need to add fuel as well under WOT." Since the factory WOT fueling map is on the rich side for thermal management, extra fuel during WOT isn't helping the production of power to the ground. With a properly done tune, the LTFTs will be slightly negative so the PCM does not add extra fuel to the WOT mode; thus increasing power.
A "real" part-throttle tune (can't be done on a DynoJet with a few WOT pulls) will also take into account increased air flow as well as new air (a fluid just like water) path harmonics introduced by modifications such as cold air intakes, headers and exhaust. This fine tuning across the entire engine rpm and intake manifold pressure range increases the throttle response and as a side benefit, creates more perfect fueling maps which results in smaller and more accurate LTFTs which in turn leads to more accurate WOT fueling and power production.For many young Australian surfers, this is the moment they've been waiting for all year. The 2017 Taj's Small Fries crowned seven new champions in Yallingup, Western Australia.
The event organized by former Championship Tour (CT) surfer Taj Burrow got underway in three different locations - Injidup, Yallingup, and Shallows - with a broad range of ocean conditions. In the end, the future stars of Australian surfing confirmed they're ready for the world.
"I couldn't be happier with how the event has gone, it seems to get better and better every year, and I'm stoked to be here to see the groms tear into their finals," explained a very happy Taj Burrow.
The 12th Annual Taj's Small Fries introduced a new division. The 10 & Under Mixed category saw Maverick Wilson giving his heart and soul to the waves.
In the highly competitive 16 & Under Boys division, Finn Cox was able to drop a 9.50 for an excellent backhand ride and confirmed his superiority in a final that also included Kian Martin, Seth Van Haeften, and Charlie Castleden.
"It's been the best day ever, and this is the biggest winner I've ever had. Taj is one of my favorite surfers, and I can't wait to go on the Surfing World trip. It's going to be sick," stated Finn Cox.
Emma Cattlin shone in the 16 & Under Girls division. The young talent used local break knowledge to overcome April McPherson, Arabelle Gibson, and Taiana Duncan.
"I'm off to the GromSearch National Final, so this is the perfect confidence boost before I head to North Narrabeen tonight. Thanks to Taj and all the organizers for such a great event," concluded Cattlin.

Everyone did it, so you joined in too. But the older you get, the more annoying it is to see a status such as, “I love so and so to the moon and back just because…” or “Blah blah is my world!” Er… what?
Sure, when we first start out in relationships, you are in the honeymoon period as we all know. Everything is great, fantastic even, and you are happy. You want to share this happiness with everyone, and I think people kind of accept that. But after a month or so, we get over it. Fair enough, be happy, but people will start to get a bit aggy.
But what I think gets to me more, is the people who still tweet or facebook VDA and do not see why others get annoyed. Nearly four in ten admit to feeling annoyed or embarrassed by friends VDA, because the other six are probably the culprits. I am sure I will get some comments about keeping my nose out, and that I shouldn’t get so wound up by other people’s happiness; I am happy for them if they are all loved up with their other halves; but I do not need to see it.
I sometimes think VDA is worse than PDA. With PDA, sure it is gross to see couples snogging (eew) the face of each other, but VDA kinda goes to the next level, because it becomes extremely personal. Some things I just do not need to know.
My twitter feed and my facebook wall gets swamped by VDA on a daily basis, but on twitter I can sometimes let it slide – if you write a tweet about a day out you and your other half shared, or that they got you a present, or if they have done a nice gesture. I also understand when couples share links on each other’s timeline because they saw it and thought it would make the other laugh, or if it is a shared interest, to be able to talk about. But I have had to hide a couple of close friends due to their VDA behaviour.
I do not need to know about you and your other halves “sexy” habits, I do not want to see half naked photos, I really do not need soppy love poems splashed for everyone to see. The whole point of being in a relationship is about you and your partner, not you, your partner, your friends, your colleagues, your frenemies, your parents!
At the end of the day, I cannot tell people how to act because every couple is different. But do not be offended if I end up having to hide you from my feeds because I still want to be your friend, I just do not want your VDA/PDA rubbed in my face.Collected by Merlin Mitchell

Doney Hammondtree
Fayetteville, Ark.
July 10, 1950
Arkansas in '82
(The State of Ark.)
Mitch..This is July 10, 1950. Mr. Doney Hammondtree has come in from
Farmington to Fayetteville and he's going to sing some songs.
Doney..Arkansas in '82.
Mitch..How came you call it that? Was it written in that year?
Doney. .Yeah, in the year of '82. It's in the song.
Mitch..Oh, I see, that's part of the song.
My name is Sanford Barnes, I came from Buffalo Town,
I've travelled this wide world over, boys, I've roamed the world around,
I've had my ups and downs through life and better days I've saw,
But I never knew what misery was 'til I came to Arkansas.
I landed in Saint Louis, six dollars and no more,
I read the daily paper, boys, until both eyes were sore,
Looking for advertisements and at last I saw,
A thousand hands was wanted in the State of Arkansas.
'Twas in the year of '82, in the merry month. of June,
I landed in Van Buren one weltring afternoon,
Up came a walking skeleton and handed me his paw,
Invited me to his hotel, the best in Arkansas.
I followed up this great big blow unto his dwelling place,
And misery was pictured in his melancholy face,
His bread it was corn hoe cake, his beef I couldn't chaw,
He taxed me 50 a day in the State of Arkansas.
I started out next morning to catch the early train,
He says, You'd better work for me; I've got sore land to drain;
I'll give you 50 a day, you're wash and board and all;
I think you'll be a different man when you leave Arkansas.
He fed me on corn dodgers as hard as any rock,
My teeth began to loosen, my knees began to knock,
I got so thin on sassafras tea I could hide behind a straw,
I was a different man, you bet, when I left Arkansas.
I worked six weeks for this galoot, Jess Harold was his name,
He stood six feet seven in his boots, as slender as a crane,
His hair it hung in rat tails around his long and lantern jaw,
He's a photograph of all the gents that live in Arkansas.
The very day I left there, I dread its memories still,
I shook the heels both off-a my boots with a bloody, blasted chill,
I staggered into a saloon and called for whisky raw,
And got as drunk as blazes and left old Arkansas.
Oh, now I am a railroad man at a dollar and a half a day,
And here I allow to work until I can get away,
Then I'll go to the Cherokee Nation and marry me a squaw,
Farewell to hog and homminy in the State of Arkansas.

Application of Signature Analysis and Operating Deflection Shapes to Identify Interior Noise Sources in an Excavator
2007-05-15
2007-01-2427
The objective of this study was to identify and gain an understanding of the origins of noise in a commercial excavator cab. This paper presents the results of two different tests that were used to characterize the vibration and acoustic characteristics of the excavator cab. The first test was done in an effort to characterize the vibration properties of the cab panels and their associated contribution to the noise level inside the cab. The second set, of tests, was designed to address the contribution of the external airborne noise produced by the engine and hydraulic pump to the overall interior noise. This paper describes the test procedures used to obtain the data for the signature analysis, operational deflection shapes (ODS), and sound diagnosis analysis. It also contains a discussion of the analysis results and an inside look into the possible contributors of key frequencies to the interior noise in the excavator cab.Search and rescue: "All he wanted was to escape, no matter the likelihood of drowning"..
Of the many accounts people shared with me, this is the one I find hardest to forget. I can imagine the busy road and the city full of life, while behind a tall, impenetrable wall a group of voiceless, terrified men work in complete silence, hidden from the rest of the world, afraid they could lose their lives at any moment.
Hearing his story, I can understand why he got on the flimsy rubber dinghy in the middle of the night. All he wanted was to escape, at any cost, in any way possible – no matter the likelihood of capsizing and drowning.
The fate of the more than 473 people who have lost their lives in the Central Mediterranean this year was not enough to deter him. Nor was the fact that he could not swim.
The rescues
For the 354 people we rescued, the hours and days they spent at the mercy of the waves, in unstable, overcrowded boats, in the punishing heat of the August sun – and through the cold dark hours of the night – pushed many to the edge.

"I spoke to a teenager whose foot was marked with a bullet wound; he was shot by a sniper while walking to get food and then refused treatment at hospital because he was a Black African"
Most people I spoke to in these first minutes could not even remember their age or nationality. As I asked them the question again, in another language, I was often met with a look of stunned silence. It spoke to the trauma louder than words.
The stories
The frantic hours of the rescue operations eventually subsided, to be replaced by another set of pressing imperatives: the distribution of food, clothes and hygiene items, the provision of medical care for non-emergency cases, and the assessment of vulnerabilities and needs.
As people regained some strength and felt safe enough to do so, they came to me and insisted I listen to their experiences.
I met a young man with shrapnel still left in his body, the result of an explosion in Tripoli that killed his father and younger sister. I spoke to a teenager whose foot was marked with a bullet wound; he was shot by a sniper while walking to get food and then refused treatment at hospital because he was a Black African.
I sat with a mother too afraid to let her toddler stray more than a few metres away after witnessing armed men burying other women’s babies alive in the sand.
John told me that he was doing construction work at a house one day when he accidentally broke a window. The owner of the house called his employer and asked for compensation of 500 Libyan dinars (approximately €300). The man overheard his employer’s response: “This African is not worth 500 dinars; do whatever you want with him.”
And that is what happened. The owner made another phone call and, a few hours later, the man was imprisoned for three months. He told me he was beaten, tortured and electrocuted every day. He showed me one of his fingers which was completely disfigured from the physical abuse. All because of one broken window.
The list goes on. And on. Except it is less a list than a macabre catalogue of shameful, inexcusable acts of brutality and discrimination. Every scar, every dog bite, every disfigured and incapacitated limb serves to map the many points during their journeys at which humanity had been assailed. These are the tales of human life devalued.
The waiting game
We waited for authorities to assign a place of safety to Sea-Watch 4 for 11 days. It was devastating to see how the deliberate delay to allowing people to disembark was causing intense, unnecessary suffering for those we had rescued.
After a week, one woman came to me distraught. She grabbed my hands and asked me in a pleading, panicked voice if we were going to take them back to Libya.
The absence in her eyes, normally full of empathy and warmth, told me that in her mind she was back there, in the place she had been trying to run from.
"Rescued people kept offering to help with our tasks on deck, telling us to get some rest, asking if we were doing all right. Before eating, many would first inquire if we had already had a meal and repeatedly invited us to share their food."
She kept asking me the same question every day, many times a day, with growing urgency and apprehension:
“Tell me. Tell me! Are you going to take us back?”
The youngest lost their appetites and stopped eating, which started to become a cause of concern for the medics. The delay was taking a toll.
As exhausted and anxious as they seemed during those difficult days, it was moving to see how people maintained their polite, caring demeanour towards the crew.
The combination of round-the-clock work on deck in the scorching heat and taxing night-watch shifts had started to drain our faces of colour, leaving a depleted look that – even under layers of PPE (personal protective equipment) – was difficult to hide.
Rescued people kept offering to help with our tasks on deck, telling us to get some rest, asking if we were doing all right. Before eating, many would first inquire if we had already had a meal and repeatedly invited us to share their food.
Those moments of camaraderie and human solidarity, and the many considerate and selfless gestures, with which the rescued people took care of each other – and of us – restored a sense of hope and defiance on board, even in the bleakest of days.
Saying goodbye
On the eleventh day after the first rescue, we finally received the news that brought much-needed comfort and relief: Italian authorities had instructed Sea-Watch 4 to go to Palermo in Sicily, where the people would be transferred to a quarantine ship.
People started leaving, one by one. Because of COVID-19 prevention measures, we were unable to hug them or give a handshake, so we saluted them with silhouette hearts with our hands and waved goodbye.
They waved back as they stepped off the ship and onto the ferry, having arrived, after months and years of profound adversity, in Europe.
I recognise the inconceivably high price they paid to reach this place. The months or years of exploitation, the parents, children and relatives lost along the way, the friends that were left behind or drowned, and the darkest moments of being completely abandoned, of being denied compassion and assistance.
I remember all the moments with the rescued people with more gratitude and admiration for their resilience, patience and kindness – to me and my colleagues – than I ever managed to express.
In the last minutes we spent together, there were final words of gratitude and encouragement. Some people asked us to keep saving lives at sea, to make sure that no one was left behind.
We wanted to say that we would, but we knew that this was a promise we could not stand behind, that the fate of our ship was foretold. And that once we entered Italy there was little chance we would be allowed to leave again.
We were right. Fifteen days after the rescued people disembarked, Sea-Watch 4 was placed under an administrative block. The technicalities used as grounds for detention served to provide a veneer of legality to the politically motivated decision to block a fifth lifesaving asset from the Central Mediterranean in the past five months.
As I sit here now, prevented from doing my job at sea, I think of those we did not, will not, have the chance to rescue. I think of what it takes to risk your life for the chance of a secure, normal and dignified existence.
I think of these people I will likely never meet and hope they too defy the odds that Europe has stacked against them and somehow make it to safety.
I remember all those still trapped in Libya, held behind the tall and impassable wall that is now the Central Mediterranean.
Hidden out of sight and forced into complete silence – just like the men in Patrick’s compound – tens of thousands of people continue to bear inhuman brutality, cruelty and injustice every single day, as Europe closes its ears and looks the other way.
Names have been changed
Mediterranean search and rescue
The Central Mediterranean has been emptied of rescue boats, the result of a sustained campaign to criminalize NGOs trying to save lives at European borders.
Even as we hear the news of fatal shipwrecks, Sea-Watch 4 and our MSF team on board remains trapped in the port of Palermo, unable to resume lifesaving operations.
There is a danger the systematic detention of rescue ships is becoming perceived as the new “normal”, but it is unacceptable that men, women and children are being left to die in the water, within weeks of the EU heralding its new humane approach to migration.Visit Our Website |Request Info |Print |Email A Friend Alaska Outdoor Gear Rental, LLC.

This was a quick trip, but refreshing nonetheless. I got in just before midnight Thursday and took a 7am flight out Sunday, leaving me with 2 full days to soak up the sun.
So, if you don't know this, Miami is a moderately expensive city, especially when it comes to food, so heading into this trip I was not keen on spending lots of money on a weekend wardrobe refresh. I bought some new items, but focused on what I already owned to put together these outfits. Not buying new clothes freed up some cash to do more fun things in Miami.KR Pass is a train pass exclusively for foreign visitors or foreign residents in Korea only.

Patriarch of Kyiv and All Rus-Ukraine Filaret claims that after receiving a Tomos on autocephaly from Constantinople, the Ukrainian Orthodox Church that is now in unity with the Russian Orthodox Church will lose the right to be called "Ukrainian."
"It is the Ukrainian Church of the Kyiv Patriarchate and the UAOC (Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church) who will receive the tomos, which will mean the unification of said churches. The Moscow Patriarchate will have to decide: either to join the canonical Ukrainian Church, recognized by the Ecumenical Patriarchate and other churches, or not. We assume that not all parishes, priests and bishops will join the Local Church. No one will force them to do this. However, those who do not join will not have the right to be called the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, remaining only the metropolis or exarchate of the Russian Orthodox Church in Ukraine," Patriarch Filaret told the parliamentary newspaper, Holos Ukrainy.
He also estimated Ukraine's chances of obtaining the tomos at "99 percent," adding that "the Synod meeting is scheduled to be held in the Constantinople Church in Istanbul in the first half of July."
As UNIAN reported earlier, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko announced on April 17.
Ukrainian experts recently explained, and debunked, Russian propaganda's narratives aimed at hindering Ukraine's efforts to gain autocephaly for its church. It was also reported that Russian intelligence could resort to provocations to sow discord.Prize Distribution Ceremony of Laurel Home School Gujranwala

Venezuela joins WISTA International
June 18, 2018
The Women’s International Shipping & Trading Association (WISTA) continues its expansion in South America, welcoming WISTA Venezuela. WISTA Venezuela joins WISTA Argentina, WISTA Brazil, WISTA Peru, and WISTA Uruguay in representing female executives in shipping based in South America.
“WISTA International is proud to add WISTA Venezuela to our global network,” said Despina Panayiotou Theodosiou, president of WISTA International. “WISTA Venezuela brings additional opportunities to women in shipping throughout the world, as well as expands opportunities for business and professional development for Venezuelan women in shipping.”
“Being a member of WISTA International, empowers Venezuelan women and promotes the maritime transport sector and international trade,” said Debora Valeria, president of WISTA Venezuela. “WISTA International offers WISTA Venezuela members a wide network of global contacts to generate new business opportunities, participate in initiatives with organizations such as International Maritime Organization (IMO), Institute of Chartered Ship Brokers (ICS), Baltic and International Maritime Council (BIMCO), and the Organization of American States’ Inter-American Committee on Ports, and increase recognition of our capabilities, which strengthens the maritime industry in Venezuela.”
WISTA Venezuela is led by the President of WISTA Venezuela Débora Valera, President of VSV Marine & Port Group and President of the Venezuelan Maritime Cluster; Vice President María Grazia Blanco, Vice President of the Venezuelan Branch of the Ibero-American Institute of Maritime Law; General Secretary Ines Tovar Rodríguez, General Director of Ports of the Ministry of Popular Power for Transport; Treasurer Marlys Alexandra Lemus, Executive Director of APAVEN and Vice President of Social Development of the Venezuelan Maritime Cluster; and Executive Director María Rodrigues, President of the Venezuelan and Caribbean Association of Maritime and Port Medicine and Vice President of Maritime Medicine of the Venezuelan Maritime Cluster.
Additional founding members of WISTA Venezuela include: Adriana Ulloa, Deputy Vice President of the Venezuelan Branch of the Ibero-American Institute of Maritime Law; Luzday Andrea Borrero, Globals Maritime Engineer; Elsy del Valle Rodríguez, Vice President of Maritime and Port Woman of the Venezuelan Maritime Cluster; Luisa Elena Álvarez Pérez, Partner at Carrillo & Asociados; Ana María Rodríguez, General Operations of Cygnus Marine Services, C. A. CYGMAR SERVICES; and Carla Hurtado, Director of the VENAVEGA Office. And a first active member Ana Mary Ramírez recognized International Maritime Lawyer.
Three National WISTA Associations have established in South America this year: WISTA Venezuela, WISTA Peru, and WISTA Uruguay. An additional National WISTA Association is expected to form in the region this year. In addition to domestic events for networking and business development, National WISTA Associations often participate in regional and international WISTA Conferences. A WISTA Americas conference was held earlier this year in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The next global WISTA International Annual General Meeting & Conference will be held in Tromsø, Norway this October.
WISTA International is an international networking organization for female executives in the shipping industry. WISTA International is comprised of 44 National WISTA Associations (NWA) around the world and nearly 3,000 members. National WISTA Associations are formed in individual countries. To launch a National WISTA Association, the association must file appropriate paperwork in the home country, have at least ten members in management positions and pay annual fees to WISTA International. In addition to the new National WISTA Associations in South America, WISTA International has welcomed WISTA Japan and WISTA Panama in 2018.
“Participation and integration of women in the maritime sector is a topic of great discussion in international organizations, and of equal importance in the national agencies in Venezuela. We must assume the responsibility of ensuring programs and activities planned by maritime organizations include not only representatives of the maritime authorities, but also women from the private sector in the maritime industry, with the goal of eliminating all forms of discrimination against women. We believe that IMO is setting the example with the approval of WISTA International as a consultative member. WISTA Venezuela looks forward to supporting WISTA International in IMO committees and activities,” said Valera.

Stacey, fabulous inspiration. I could move into her home without changing a thing (you think she'd leave the furniture?). I scrolled down to see the cute picture of you and Mr. in your soon-to-be kitchen. What a wonderful space, and that view from the back yard is so peaceful and beautiful. Can't wait to see what you'll do in the new home. laurie500ml LED Ultrasonic Essential Oil Humidifier Diffuser Mist Aromatherapy Air Purifier

<div align="center"><a href="" target="_blank"><img src="" alt="Author Chelsea Camaron" style="border:none;"/></a></div>Team Finchley: Coach Harriss
Fri 28 December 2018
WMF News of his bedroom window with a ball when he was supposed to be doing his homework!”
Now, of course, we can’t condone his bedroom window jumping or skipping meals as gaining an education and nutrition are both very important, but when you want something hard enough you will find a way of working hard enough to achieve your goal.
Ronaldo is one of WMF’s favourites as he is a driven, passionate and a continually developing player and these are some of the characteristics we look for in our Coaching Team. We asked our locally raised Coach Hariss a few questions about all things football, his life and the journey so far to achieve his own goals.
Question: What got you into football coaching?
Coach Hariss: When I was young the coaches that trained me weren’t really into it, I decided I wanted to make a change and become all the things they weren’t when I coached. Every day I coach I learn new things from our players regardless of their age, every day is a school day and an opportunity for me to develop as a coach. Passion and development are two things that I strive to achieve on a daily basis.
Question: What coach inspires you?
CH: Zidane is just such an accomplished football figure both as a coach and as a player. Already in a short coaching career, he has managed to bring out the best in extremely talented players and won 3 back to back Champions League titles, a feat that will most likely not happen again.
Question: Where do you see yourself in 5 years time?
CH: As I am still a young coach, I believe I still have a lot to give as a player too. I would like to see myself progressing into the professional game be it in England or abroad and whilst playing to still continue my coaching journey and carry on gaining my badges. I hope that my experiences as a player can help me to develop as a coach and create a positive effect on younger footballers.
Having grown up in the local community it’s great to see Coach Hariss developing young local players and creating a positive change in our area. Coach Hariss is at our weekly training session in Finchley on a Wednesday which you can try for free by booking here.- Money is a common source of stress and arguments for many couples.
- In a marriage, couples sometimes think that they need to share everything — including bank accounts.
- However, having separate finances allows you to be in control of your spending, reduces the stress of having a joint bank account, and allows you to have fun with your money..<!–- Google Tag Manager (noscript) -–>

No agenciesIf your Facebook news feed has been polluted with some extremely graphic and unpleasant imagery lately, well, our condolences. But it's probably not your actual Facebook friends who are posting it there. At least not on purpose. A massive wave of this kind of imagery has been appearing as a result of a directed attack on the social networking site.
Facebook says the problem is now under control and that suspects have been identified but this relatively new kind of attack is one we might be seeing a lot more of in the near future. It's described by Facebook as a "self cross-scripted attack."
Chester Wisniewski of the security firm Sophos decodes that term for us. He says, "in essence, it means that people are being tricked into putting computer code directly into their own web browsers to spread these messages."
Often, these attacks get started by someone getting lured in by a salacious headline, says Wisniewski. "We've seen things like this happen in the past on Facebook. The last major one we saw was one purporting to be pictures of the dead Osama bin Laden and you need to paste this special code into your computer to see the pictures. We've also seen things like gift card lures, like we've seen recently on Facebook where people are promised a $25 Starbucks gift card if they fill out a form, but instead of filling out the form the page says, 'We can shortcut the process and you can just insert this special code into your computer and it will automatically sign you up for the free gift card.'"
You might wonder what's the difference between pasting in code as opposed to simply clicking on a link. A browser generally has a mechanism that detects something funky happening elsewhere in the session and it will stop one site from controlling another. When you paste in the code, however, that protection is gone. In that case, says, Wisniewski, "Certainly you can surrender access to whatever website you're operating on at the time. So if you're on Facebook, then in theory by pasting this code in, the attackers would be able to take over your Facebook profile, and instruct your Facebook to do whatever they wanted. It could also be used to take all your photos and do just anything you can do as a human on Facebook. And even more scary to think about if you were to do this while you were logged into your bank, they could potentially transfer funds or transfer your account."
As for what you can do about it, Wisniewski repeats the same advice you should be following already in this age: "Good practices are one, always make sure your software is up-to-date. Run the latest version of whichever your favorite web browser is and make sure it's up to date. And two, if you don't understand something and it looks like a bunch of gibberish, you probably shouldn't paste it into your browser."
Also on this program, if you're tired of politicians robocalling you, now you can call them back just as robotically. It's called Reverse Robocall.
“I think the best compliment I can give is not to say how much your programs have taught me (a ton), but how much Marketplace has motivated me to go out and teach myself.” – Michael in Arlington, VABEFORE YOU GOMarch 13, 2019
Management Standards for Hazardous Waste Pharmaceuticals
On February 22, 2019, the long-awaited “pharmaceutical rule” was published in the Federal Register. [84 FR 5816] First proposed in September 2015, this rule creates a new Part 266, Subpart P for healthcare facilities and reverse distributors managing RCRA hazardous waste pharmaceuticals. Subpart P is designed to improve and clarify the regulation of these materials. The rule defines and regulates two entities—healthcare facilities and reverse distributors—who must comply with the new subpart when it becomes effective in their state. Except for healthcare facilities that are very small quantity generators (VSQGs), these entities cannot opt to manage hazardous waste pharmaceuticals per the traditional Part 262 standards.
Healthcare Facilities
Healthcare. This definition includes wholesale distributors, third-party logistics providers that serve as forward distributors, military medical logistics facilities, hospitals and veterinary hospitals, ambulatory surgical centers, health clinics, physicians’ offices, optical and dental providers, chiropractors, long-term care facilities, ambulance services, pharmacies and other retailers of pharmaceuticals, and veterinary clinics. Pharmaceutical manufacturers, reverse distributors, and reverse logistics centers are not healthcare facilities.
Healthcare facilities are subject to two different sets of standards when managing hazardous waste pharmaceuticals, based on whether such pharmaceuticals are “potentially creditable” or “non-creditable.” Nonhazardous waste pharmaceuticals are not subject to RCRA’s hazardous waste standards, but healthcare facilities may also manage their nonhazardous pharmaceuticals according to Part 266, Subpart P if they so choose.
Potentially creditable hazardous waste pharmaceutical means a prescription hazardous waste pharmaceutical that has a reasonable expectation of receiving manufacturer credit and is 1) in original manufacturer packaging, 2) undispensed, and 3) unexpired (or less than one year past its expiration date). The final rule allows healthcare facilities to send potentially creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals to reverse distributors, provided they meet the minimal requirements in new §§266.502(a), 266.503, and 266.509. These requirements primarily include notification, recordkeeping to ensure proper delivery, spill response, and DOT shipping provisions. Notably, a hazardous waste manifest is not required. EPA believes that creditable pharmaceuticals are less likely to be released to the environment and so has decided not to impose specific management standards during their accumulation (e.g., no accumulation time limits, no container labeling). Note that potentially creditable pharmaceuticals are solid and hazardous waste under the new Subpart P (although they are subject to minimal standards as noted above). This is a significant departure from previous EPA policy, which allowed pharmaceuticals to be sent from healthcare facilities to reverse distributors as products—not solid and hazardous waste.
Non-creditable hazardous waste pharmaceutical means a prescription hazardous waste pharmaceutical that does not have a reasonable expectation to be eligible for manufacturer credit or a nonprescription hazardous waste pharmaceutical that does not have a reasonable expectation to be legitimately used/reused or reclaimed. These pharmaceuticals will typically be sent to a designated TSD facility and must be managed by healthcare facilities in accordance with the numerous requirements in new §§266.502 and 266.508. These requirements are comparable to the standards for traditional hazardous wastes managed at small quantity generators and include:
- Notification as a healthcare facility using EPA’s Site Identification Form (Form 8700-12) is required as part of the facility’s next biennial report, or if not required to submit a biennial report, within 60 days of becoming subject to the new regulations.
- Training is required so that applicable personnel are thoroughly familiar with proper waste handling and emergency procedures.
- Hazardous waste determinations must be performed, unless the healthcare facility chooses to manage its hazardous and nonhazardous waste pharmaceuticals together as non-creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals. Hazardous waste codes need not be identified.
- Containers used to manage non-creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals are subject to standards similar to those found in Part 262 for hazardous waste containers, including the requirements to be structurally sound, compatible with their contents, specially managed if holding ignitable or reactive wastes, closed and secured to prevent unauthorized access, and labeled “Hazardous Waste Pharmaceuticals.”
- Waste accumulation time is up to one year.
- Compliance with the land disposal restrictions (LDR) in Part 268, including completion of generator LDR paperwork per §268.7(a), is required although no hazardous waste codes need to be identified on these notifications.
- Healthcare facilities must immediately contain and clean up spills. Spill clean-up materials must be managed as non-creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals in accordance with the requirements of Subpart P.
- A uniform hazardous waste manifest must be used to ship non-creditable pharmaceuticals to a designated TSD facility, with the word “PHARMS” entered in Block 13. Rejected shipments from the designated facility may be managed for up to an additional 90 days at the healthcare facility.
- DOT-required packaging, labeling, marking, and placarding are required for shipments of non-creditable pharmaceuticals that meet the definition of a DOT hazardous material. Additional RCRA marking is required when shipping containers with a capacity of 119 gal or less per §266.508(a)(1)(iii)(B).
- Non-creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals do not have to be included in biennial reports (if required by the facility’s generator category). However, copies of hazardous waste determinations (if required), manifests, exception reports, and LDR paperwork must be maintained for at least three years.
Healthcare facilities that are VSQGs when factoring in both hazardous waste pharmaceuticals and nonpharmaceutical hazardous waste may choose to opt into Subpart P for the management of their hazardous pharmaceutical waste. [new §266.504] These facilities may also choose to manage all of their hazardous waste (pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical) in accordance with §262.14.
A healthcare facility does not have to count its hazardous waste pharmaceuticals (that are subject to or managed in accordance with Subpart P) when determining its generator category. [new §262.13(c)(9)] As a result, a healthcare facility may experience a change in RCRA generator category for its nonpharmaceutical hazardous waste.
Reverse Distributors
Reverse distributors are the entities that receive potentially creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals from healthcare facilities and evaluate them to determine if they are eligible for manufacturer credit. The new rule allows reverse distributors to accept these materials from offsite without a RCRA permit as long as they comply with the requirements in new §266.510. These requirements are comparable to the standards for traditional hazardous wastes managed at large quantity generators and include:
- Notification as a reverse distributor using EPA’s Site Identification Form (Form 8700-12) is required within 60 days of becoming subject to the new regulations.
- The reverse distributor must evaluate each potentially creditable hazardous waste pharmaceutical within 30 calendar days of receipt. Once the evaluation is complete, the material becomes known as an evaluated hazardous waste pharmaceutical.
- A current inventory of both potentially creditable and evaluated hazardous waste pharmaceuticals must be maintained. This inventory must include the pharmaceutical identity (e.g., name) and quantity.
- After evaluation, evaluated hazardous waste pharmaceuticals may be accumulated for up to 180 days.
- Reverse distributors must prevent unknowing, and minimize unauthorized, entry to the hazardous waste pharmaceutical accumulation areas.
- The contingency plan and emergency procedures of Part 262, Subpart M must be in place.
- The notification and closure performance standards of §262.17(a)(8)(ii) and (iii) must be followed when closing an area where waste pharmaceuticals were accumulated.
- Reporting and recordkeeping are required, including maintaining copies of notification paperwork (Site ID form), shipping papers, delivery confirmations, and any unauthorized waste reports. Unauthorized waste reports must be sent to EPA if the reverse distributor receives waste from offsite that it is not authorized to receive (e.g., nonpharmaceutical hazardous waste, regulated medical waste).
After evaluation of potentially creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals has been completed, the reverse distributor becomes subject to additional requirements for the management of evaluated hazardous waste pharmaceuticals, including:
- An onsite accumulation area must be designated so that evaluated hazardous waste pharmaceuticals are segregated and clearly distinguished from potentially creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals. This designated area must be inspected at least once every seven days.
- Training is required for applicable personnel according to §262.17(a)(7).
- Containers used to manage evaluated hazardous waste pharmaceuticals are subject to standards similar to those found in Part 262 for hazardous waste containers, including the requirements to be structurally sound, compatible with their contents, kept closed (if holding liquids or gels), specially managed if holding ignitable or reactive wastes, and labeled “hazardous waste pharmaceuticals.”
- Containers must be marked with applicable hazardous waste codes prior to shipping.
- A uniform hazardous waste manifest must be used to ship evaluated pharmaceuticals to a designated TSD facility, with applicable waste codes entered in Block 13. Rejected shipments from the designated facility may be managed for up to an additional 90 days at the reverse distributor.
- DOT-required packaging, labeling, marking, and placarding are required for shipments of evaluated pharmaceuticals that meet the definition of a DOT hazardous material. Additional RCRA marking is required when shipping containers with a capacity of 119 gal or less per §266.508(a)(1)(iii)(B).
- Compliance with the LDR requirements in Part 268, including completion of generator LDR paperwork per §268.7(a), is required. Hazardous waste codes need to be identified on these notifications.
- A biennial report must be submitted to EPA in accordance with §262.41 for evaluated hazardous waste pharmaceuticals that are transported to a TSD facility.
- Records (i.e., logs) of accumulation area inspections and copies of manifests, biennial reports, exception reports, and LDR paperwork must be maintained for at least three years. Additionally, personnel training records must be maintained per §262.17(a)(7)(iv).
Additional Provisions
The following additional provisions are part of the final rule:
Revisions to P075 nicotine listing—EPA has amended the P075 listing, stating that “this listing does not include patches, gums and lozenges that are FDA-approved over-the-counter nicotine replacement therapies.” Because over-the-counter patches, gums, and lozenges are regulated by the FDA and have generally low and known nicotine concentrations, the agency has concluded that these products do not meet the acute toxicity criteria in §261.11(a)(2). Note that this exception from the P075 listing does not include e-cigarettes, nicotine-containing e-liquids (e.g., “vape-pen” cartridges), or prescription nicotine replacement therapies (NRTs). The agency found that the nicotine levels in these latter products are still potentially acutely toxic to both humans and animals and, therefore, these products must still be included in the P075 listing in §261.33(e). But, e-cigarettes, e-liquids, and prescription NRTs will still be eligible for management as hazardous waste pharmaceuticals under new Part 266, Subpart P when they are discarded.
Sewer ban—EPA is prohibiting the sewering of hazardous waste pharmaceuticals by all healthcare facilities and reverse distributors in new §266.505, including those that are VSQGs. This ban extends to pharmaceuticals that are DEA-controlled substances or mixed waste pharmaceuticals (i.e., those that are both RCRA hazardous and radioactive). Although EPA does not have the statutory authority to apply the prohibition to nonhazardous waste pharmaceuticals, the agency strongly recommends against sewering any pharmaceuticals.
Exemption for DEA-controlled substances—EPA has promulgated a conditional exemption from RCRA management for hazardous waste pharmaceuticals that are also controlled substances under the DEA regulations. [new §266.506] There are only a handful of drugs meeting this criterion that are in common usage: chloral/chloral hydrate, fentanyl sublingual spray, phenobarbital, testosterone gels, and valium injectable. To make use of the conditional exemption, the hazardous waste pharmaceutical must 1) not be sewered, 2) be managed in compliance with all DEA regulations for controlled substances, and 3) be destroyed by a method that meets DEA’s non-retrievable standard of destruction or combusted in one of five specific units. This exemption is also extended to household waste pharmaceuticals collected in take-back events and programs.
Empty pharmaceutical containers—In new §266.507, EPA made it easier to dispose of containers that still hold residues of hazardous waste pharmaceuticals but that don’t necessarily meet the definition of RCRA-empty in §261.7. Stock, dispensing, and unit-dose containers (not to exceed 1 liter or 10,000 pills) will be considered RCRA-empty if the pharmaceuticals have been removed using standard practices employed to remove materials from that type of container. Syringes will be regarded as empty if the contents have been removed by fully depressing the plunger of the syringe. Intravenous (IV) bags will be considered empty provided the pharmaceuticals in the IV bag have been fully administered to the patient.
Nonprescription pharmaceuticals and unsold retail items—Nonprescription pharmaceuticals sent through reverse logistics systems are not solid wastes if they have a reasonable expectation of being legitimately used/reused (e.g., lawfully redistributed for their intended purpose) or reclaimed. [new §266.501(g)(2)] Similarly, in the preamble to the final rule, EPA established a policy that other unsold retail items that are sent through reverse logistics are not solid wastes at the retail store, because they have a reasonable expectation of being legitimately used/reused or reclaimed.
Effective Date and State Authorization
The entire final rule will become effective in the non-RCRA-authorized states (i.e., Alaska and Iowa) on August 21, 2019. For the 48 authorized states:
- The prohibition on sewering hazardous waste pharmaceuticals will become effective in all states on August 21, 2019, since this is the one rule provision that is promulgated under HSWA authority.
- All other, non-HSWA rule provisions will not take effect until the state adopts equivalent state requirements. Taken as a whole, EPA considers new Subpart P to be more stringent than the current federal standards. Therefore, authorized states will be required to adopt most of the new provisions.
- The P075 nicotine listing revision is the one new provision that is less stringent than the current RCRA requirements. Thus, authorized states are not required to adopt this change, although EPA encourages all states to do so to promote national consistency.
EPA has provided a summary of the final rule and answers to frequent questions..Ek Phool Teen Kante Movie Part 1 Free Download

Congratulations is in order for two Bachelor Nation stars. On Friday, May 18, People reported that Sean Lowe and Catherine Giudici welcomed their second child. Shortly after People shared this news, Catherine and Sean announced the arrival of Samuel's younger brother, Isaiah Hendrix, with some Instagram photos. If you expect the photos of the newest member of the Giudici-Lowe family to be extremely adorable, you will not be disappointed.
Early Friday morning, Sean gave Bachelor fans a heads up that the baby was on the way. The star of The Bachelor Season 17 wrote on Twitter,
“We’re having a baby today! When the nurse at the front desk asked for our insurance card, I told her I also had a half off coupon and now I get to sit in the waiting room during the birth!”
Ah, good. Sean has been a father for just under two years and he already has mastered the ancient and revered art that is the dad joke. Really impressive work.
A mere 12 hours after Sean attempted to use a coupon at a hospital, he and Catherine hopped on social media and posted some delivery room pics. Some ridiculously precious delivery room pics, that is. Augh, this baby is beyond sweet.
In November 2017, Sean and Catherine announced via Instagram that they would soon become a family of four. In one of the cute videos, Sean asks Samuel to say “baby.” Samuel replies, “bubbuhl” and points to Catherine’s stomach. In the other cute video, Catherine points to her stomach and asks Samuel if he knows what it is. He replies, “bubbuhl.” Sean and Catherine said in a statement to Entertainment Tonight,
"We are so thrilled to announce that we are expecting our second child! We consider ourselves so blessed to have Samuel in our lives and we are already thanking God for the newest edition to our family who should be arriving in late May. We are so thankful to everyone who has followed our little family and encouraged us along the way."
Six months after the IG videos made their way onto the internet, the bubbuhl arrived. And there could be more bubbuhls down the line. In April 2017, Catherine told Entertainment Tonight that she would like to have five kids. She said,
"I'm the person that wants a soccer team as a family and have a compound and everyone sleeping together in bunk beds and all that stuff. So yeah, there will definitely be more… I think five. Three natural and two adopted. That's my vision. We're probably going to start trying soon.”
Sean, on the other hand, seems to want to stop at three. He told ET,
“[Growing up], it was just me and my sister. Two is a great number. I could do three. I think four, that can be out of control sometimes. I would say three is a good number.”
As any Bachelor historian will tell you, Sean and Catherine are one of Bachelor Nation’s greatest success stories; they are the textbook example of “here for the right reasons.” Heck, one half of the pair literally wrote the book on the right reasons. Sean and Catherine will occasionally make cameos on The Bachelor to remind contestants that the process really can work; it doesn't always take a Ben Flajnik and Courtney Robinson-esque turn.
The couple met on Sean’s season of The Bachelor back in 2012. Catherine won, Sean proposed, and they got married on national television on Jan. 26, 2014. Catherine had their first son, Samuel, on July 2, 2016. And as of May 18, Samuel is now a big brother.
What a happy time for the Giudici-Lowe family. Welcome to the Bachelor Nation family, Isaiah.The trial of the man accused of murdering 23-year-old Molly McLaren enters its second day today (January 24).
On Tuesday (January 23), the court heard transcripts of the last WhatsApp message Molly sent to a friend moments before her death.
The jury also saw images of the weapons found in Stimpson's car following his arrest by the police and today we understand the court will see CCTV footage from the day of Molly's death.
Our reporter Will Harrison is in court all day and will be reporting live from the trial.
You can follow our live blog below for the latest updates directly from the courtroom throughout the day
CCTV from Asda in Chatham
CCTV showed Stimpson buying the knife from Asda in Chatham.
Bodycam footage of Stimpson covered in blood
Earlier the court was shown shocking footage of Stimpson taken by one of the police officer’s body-worn camera.
The video was taken just minutes after he had slashed his ex-girlfriend’s throat in her car and he is briefly seen covered in blood.
Next witnesses
The jury has heard from Leah Jane Hubbard and is now being read a witness statement from Molly’s mum Joanne McLaren.
More updates to come.
"Sometimes he called me a slag and stuff"
The court heard Miss Dale was texting and speaking to Stimpson over six months before meeting him in a local pub with a friend of hers.
They went out together to Revolution bar in Newcastle-under-Lyme.
Talking about the trip to the bar, Mr Bennetts asked if Stimpson was getting on with her friends?
Miss Dale: “No, he just sat with me. He looked a bit uneasy and a bit on edge, I was a bit wary.”
Mr Bennetts asked if she met with him again after that night, adding: “Did you later receive something like 25 missed calls from him?”
Miss Dale: “Yeah, he started off normal but then got a bit possessive. He took pictures of me asking why I was wearing certain clothes, sometimes he called me a slag and stuff.”
A witness is being sworn in
Witness Alexandra Stephanie Dale is being sworn in.
She is appearing by video link and has long straight black hair past her shoulders.
The court is hearing she met Stimpson in Newcastle back in 2013. It is understood this means Newcastle-under-Lyme in Staffordshire.
The police approach Stimpson
The jury is shown video of the car park taken from a camera at 10.58am, is reminding the jury how Stimpson is said to have followed Molly around the car park before the attack.
The pair leave the gym
Stimpson walks back up to top of stairs, appears to look back into room Molly is exercising in, then walks back down stairs again - Molly is still exercising.
The defendant is seen inside the gym near the front door with his gym bag.
He seems to linger for a few seconds before leaving via swivel door and then the front automatic door.
Stimpson is then seen walking out into car park with his gym bag before Molly leaves the gym holding a phone with a screen on, possibly texting.
Molly leaves via the swivel and front door, still holding her phone in front of her like she’s texting.
More footage from the Pure Gym
Molly exercises for a few seconds more before noticing him. When she sees him, she looks at him for a few moments then stands next to him, possibly talking.
She walks out the frame for a moment and then he does, then she returns for a moment and he does a few seconds later.
Another person also walks across the frame and that other person appears to be exercising at the back of the room.
Molly and Stimpson are now a few metres apart both exercising - she’s mostly on the floor.
Stimpson is seen going back down internal stairs and then he comes back again.
Stimpson enters the Pure Gym where Molly is exercising
Stimpson can be seen entering Pure Gym with a gym bag, wearing a white sleeveless top, dark shorts and trainers.
He walks up some internal stairs, gets to the top, hesitates heads back down, gets half way turns and goes back up.
The defendant then walks into seemingly empty room (you can’t see anyone else on camera) where Molly is exercising.
He walks in slowly past her while she exercises and takes a position a few metres to her right.
Day two of the trial is now underway
The jury is now watching CCTV footage of Stimpson buying the knife from ASDA in Maidstone Road, Chatham.
It has also seen footage from the Dockside in Chatham on the day of the killing, June 29, 2017.
The footage is from 10.06am and 11.10am and Molly can be seen entering the front door of Pure Gym
At 10.16am Stimpson drives his dad’s car into the Dockside.TIL of Hatuey, an anti-colonial revolutionary in Cuba during the 16th century.

Due February 20th, 2019 - The 2019 Eco-Comedy theme is Climate Change. Yes, it’s a vast, unwieldy topic that already has people rolling their eyes. So, the challenge to you to produce a short humorous video that will be seen on YouTube to engage audiences in climate change. The contest is open to anyone worldwide who has a flair for producing videos. There are four categories: K-8, High School, College/University, and Nonstudent.

Homily given at the 9:00 a.m. Mass on March 4, 2018, the 3rd Sunday of Lent, by Fr. Bill Spencer, retired priest of the Diocese of Saginaw, Michigan, and Priest-in-Residence at Christ the King. Fr. Bill reflects on how the readings of the day are very fitting to where we are in Lent and the call of the Lord to change our lives and be open to what He is asking of us.

My views of abortion begin with getting pregnant in high school -- my senior year, an "A" student, cheerleader, etc. Abortion was illegal; we paid three doctors for little pills that did no good. I finally married and went with a friend being shipped to Fort Benning, Ga., and had the baby. I located a doctor, eeny-meeny style, from the phone book. He just happened to know a family looking for a baby to adopt. When I got home, I was ostracized.
I married again, had four daughters and introduced them to the services of Planned Parenthood, doing all I could to educate them about this issue. Each of my daughters has had one, if not two, abortions. They also have children whom they love.
I worked at the Cathedral Hill Medical Center when abortions became legal, and I was selected to manage the abortion clinic. This was good -- helping all these women keep their lives in spite of this serious mistake. I found it rewarding because of my personal struggle. My experience, however, proved that abortion as birth control gets out of hand for some women and that the procedure needs to be done early. Late abortion is awful.
I worked at Stanford Medical Center in the late '60s. One day I noticed on the operating room schedule an excess of "D & C" procedures and was told they were really abortions. So abortion goes on for the rich always; for the poor it has to be legal and open and exposed and doesn't get a fancy medical term. It never is fair, is it?
If religious and social mores do not stop unwanted pregnancies, then why make the punishment a full-term baby?
JACQUELINE SHUPE
Pleasant Hill
I was a 21-year-old libber living in New York when abortion was legalized. My friends and I were in awe of this huge victory for womankind. In the years before, I'd heard from friends about the "hackers with hangers." Another whispered her goodbyes and returned a year later with tales of harsh nuns at the "home for unwed mothers." I couldn't decide which choice was worse. I felt sorry for all of them and prayed like hell I'd never have to make that decision.
Over the next 16 years, determined to avoid the trauma of pro-choice choices, I was religious about using reliable birth control. I was annoyingly cocky about my "perfect record." I finally did get pregnant, and was completely unprepared.
I was 37, unmarried, with symptoms of an ovarian cyst. In the examining room of my OB/GYN, I expected him to talk about my cyst. Instead -- to my shock and horror -- he tells me I'm pregnant. There is no question that I'll have an abortion. There are no other choices for me.
The pregnancy turned out to be in one of my fallopian tubes and was surgically removed. I was relieved when it was over, but oddly, as the days went by, I found myself feeling great loss. I just couldn't shake it. I lay in bed crying, thinking of this little 2-inch piece of life that could have been and what it would have been like - much, I think, like a pregnant woman imagines fingers and toes and Baby Gap outfits. My mother stayed with me while I recovered from surgery. She told me not to think about it, that it's just my hormones acting up. But I know it's not.
In a few months I met an incredible guy, and we fell in love. We decide to get married and start a family. He's the only man I've ever wanted as the father of my children. Because of my tubal pregnancy, I decide to see a fertility specialist to get the prognosis on my getting pregnant. Sitting in his consultation room (the first in what will be a very long line of them), he tells us that my tubes are so scarred that only "high-tech methods" will result in a pregnancy. I'm staring out the window now, and a sardonic smile comes over my face as I think, "All those years of wasted birth control."
Six years pass. I've had exploratories, IVFs, and surgery to repair my tubes. Nothing has worked. Nothing. We're trying to adopt, but it's not going well. Two adoptions have come to disastrous endings. We are still childless. I'm in regular, close contact with a group of women from my infertility support group. We share leads -- often just rumors -- about pregnant women who may be thinking about making her pro-choice choice (if there really is one) to have one of us adopt her baby instead of aborting it. We try to laugh, but mostly cry together. We're all women's libbers, and we're open with one another, but not one of them has dared to say what I was thinking: "If women would stop taking the easy road, stop being selfish and killing -- yes, killing -- their babies, we wouldn't be one of a million broken-hearted couples competing like hungry animals for a healthy baby." After all, I think, isn't pro-choice supposed to mean that you're considering more than one option? Why doesn't anyone choose adoption?
Oh, God, how I hated myself for thinking all of these thoughts. But especially the "baby killers." That one's really low. But I continued to think it, hiding my words behind my eyes so no one will hear them. I do not apologize for it. At age 46, I realize that if it were meant to be, whatever it is out there in the universe surely would have placed a child in my arms by now.
It's been nearly 10 years since we ended our search. We've moved on. We're still in love, and very happy. I've stopped hating myself for my "baby killer" thoughts. It was a terrible time in my life, after all. But sometimes, once in a great while, I still lie in bed and wonder if it isn't just a little bit true.

Taxes (2018): $5,928.37Choosing the right honeymoon destination can be pretty hard, since you’ll want it to be perfect. Your honeymoon is something that you’ll remember for the rest of your life, so you should make sure you plan everything right before booking your plane tickets. In order to help you pick out the right place, here are the top 20 honeymoon travel destinations.
Maldives
For most people, a tropical island is the perfect destination for a honeymoon. And who could argue with that? It’s incredibly romantic, and it will allow both of you to truly relax and enjoy your time with each other. When it comes to tropical islands, there are only a few places that can match Maldives.
Bali, Indonesia
Bali is also known as the ‘Isle of the Gods.’ This destination has been popular among honeymooners and romance seekers for quite a while, mostly because it is incredibly peaceful. Both the temples and natural beauty of this area will surely leave you enchanted.
Paris, France
This is really a no-brainer; Paris is practically synonymous with romance. A combination of the architecture, art, and food is what makes Paris special.
Venice, Italy
Not a lot of experiences are as romantic as taking a gondola ride through the Grand Canal in Venice, Italy. The whole city gives off a very romantic vibe, which is why it’s always been one of the top destinations for newlyweds.
Savannah, Georgia
If you’re American and don’t feel like going overseas for your honeymoon, then why not simply visit Savannah, Georgia? This charming city is the perfect place to relax in after all the wedding planning stress.
Sri Lanka
If you’re looking for something a little more exotic, then Sri Lanka is your best bet. This destination is especially recommended if both you and your partner are nature lovers.
Kyoto, Japan
Compared to the fast-paced life in the city of Tokyo, Kyoto will actually give you a chance to relax and enjoy the present with your significant other. Kyoto is filled with gorgeous temples and nature, so every walk you take with your partner will be more romantic than the previous.
Iceland
If both of you are really adventurous, then Iceland is the perfect country for you. It is filled with geysers, waterfalls, glaciers, volcanoes, national parks, hot springs, and pretty much any other natural wonder that you can imagine.
Tulum, Mexico
If you spent too much on your wedding, and now don’t have a lot of money for a honeymoon, then you shouldn’t worry because this is the destination for you. Tulum is a great place if you’re on a budget, and is found just an hour and a half away from the Cancun airport. Tulum is home to an ancient Mayan village. Not to mention that it also boasts some of the most beautiful beaches in the region.
Santorini, Greece
If you’re going for something extremely romantic, then you should book two tickets to Santorini, Greece. This small volcanic island is best known for its stunning sunsets, which is one of the main reason many newlyweds flock here right after their weddings.
Sonoma, California
If you want to spend your honeymoon sipping excellent wine and eating delicious food while watching surreal scenery, then Sonoma is the place for you.
Cape Town, South Africa
If you can’t decide on a honeymoon travel destination because you can’t choose between beautiful beaches, nightlife in the city, and alluring nature, then Cape Town has got you covered. From wild landscapes to an incredible nightlife scene, this city truly has it all.
British Virgin Islands
The beauty about the British Virgin Islands is that they aren’t as popular as the Seychelles or Maldives. These islands never get too crowded, so you and your significant other will have the opportunity to enjoy all the privacy you want.
Maui, Hawaii
The lush greenery, the romantic sunsets, and the clear waters are just a few things that make Maui the perfect romantic getaway.
Ibiza, Spain
There’s much more to Ibiza than its infamous nightlife scene. In fact, the island is filled with jaw-dropping nature. As you explore the island, you’ll find gorgeous beaches, picturesque small villages, and lush forests.
Punta del Este, Uruguay
Punta del Este was once just a small fishing village. However, during the last several years, this romantic getaway started attracting numerous tourists, including various celebrities and millionaires.
Myanmar
If both you and your significant other are adventurers and have already visited a lot of places around the world, then Myanmar may be the perfect destination for you. Up until recently, this country was closed off to the outside world. Myanmar is full of places that have remained untouched by globalization.
Galapagos Islands
The Galapagos Islands offer a truly unique adventure, considering that it will provide you with an unparalleled wildlife experience.
Hayman Island, Australia
If privacy is what you’re seeking, then the Hayman Island is the place where you should be. You can find this island in the heart of the Great Barrier Reef.
Vieques, Puerto Rico
Vieques is one of the best honeymoon destinations if you’re traveling on a budget. This island gives off a very charming and laid-back vibe that you won’t encounter in many other places. The beaches here are quiet and unspoiled.All the Wild Wonders – Poems of our Earth, edited by Wendy Cooling and illustrated by Piet Grobler is a collection of poetry which poses interesting questions about the world we live in. The poems encourage reflection on the wonders and beauty around us on our planet, and provoke thought about what the future holds given the impact humans have on the natural environment. There are poems in many different styles from Benjamin Zephaniah to William Blake, via Ogden Nash and John Milton, each juxtaposed in ways that draw out new and sometimes surprising comparisons.
Rich and colourful watercolour illustrations throughout make this look more like a picture book than many a poetry anthology whilst the embossed, textured cover and luxuriously thick paper that have been used for this new edition make this book simply delightful to hold in your hands as well as to read silently or aloud.
To celebrate publication of All the Wild Wonders in its new and exceptionally beautiful format earlier this spring I put some questions to Wendy Cooling, the editor of the anthology, about the way she works, the state of children’s poetry and what we could look for in the library or bookshop if we wanted to offer more great poems to the kids in our lives.
Playing by the book: When I look at the poetry books you’ve worked on sometimes they are described as being “written” by you, other times “edited” or “selected”. So what is a poetry editor? I see you almost more as a curator – you choose poems to present and juxtapose, rather than (I imagine) editing their actual words or structure?
Wendy Cooling: Yes, a poetry editor is really more like a curator than a book editor as he/she cannot change the words in a poem, or amend in any way without the poet’s consent. Sometimes an extract from a poem is agreed to but otherwise the poem is as the poet wrote it. The editor chooses and arranges the poems to present a theme or an idea in a coherent way.
Playing by the book: Where and how do you start when you’ve a new anthology to curate? With lots of books on the table? Innumerable post-it notes?….
Wendy Cooling: The beginnings of an anthology are pure joy to me. I sit somewhere comfortable, often under a tree in the garden, surrounded by mountains of poetry collections and anthologies I just read and read and read… and use lots of post-it notes. I visit the Poetry Library in London’s Festival Hall and indulge in more poetry reading and lots of photocopying. I have of course far more poems that I can ever use.
The next bit is the hard bit, weeding out poems I love but don’t quite work for the age-group or within the overall developing theme. I look for a mixture of forms as I want to move children away from the idea that poems must rhyme. I look for writing from many cultures to give a sense of the universality of poetry.
I have a budget to consider too as of course poets are paid for the inclusion of a poem. There are always one or two very eminent poets we just can’t afford.
Playing by the book: So just with the words, there are plenty of different considerations. What about when an anthology is accompanied by illustrations, as many of yours are. When you are working on an anthology to what extent do you liaise with the illustrator?
Wendy Cooling: It is quite unusual for editor and illustrator to liaise, often the two never meet. Luckily I do get to see and comment on Piet Grobler‘s very earliest roughs. We don’t always quite agree on the meaning of a poem and can talk this through, quite a fascinating process. I think I’m very fortunate and do hope to work with Piet in the future.
Playing by the book: I’d love to be able to eavesdrop on those conversations where it turns out your two interpretations don’t quite match. I bet they are very rich and interesting!
What sort of anthology would you like to curate next if you could have an entirely free say in it? Is there a theme you’d especially like to explore which you haven’t yet?
Wendy Cooling: I have three ideas that I’m working on at the moment but won’t reveal them here!
Playing by the book: Fair enough – but I will be keeping my eyes peeled for future collections!
What about this then: Is there something that poetry does better or differently than other genres in your opinion?
Wendy Cooling: Poetry is very special as it helps children to really taste words and to experiment with their own writing. To children who struggle as readers, a poetry book is very liberating – poems are quite short and there’s no rule that says you must read them all. Poetry well-introduced can be perfect to get some children into reading – they all love the ‘no rules’ bit.
Poetry is wonderful at expressing a very deep thought in few words and with great immediacy. Children don’t become good readers until they are able to hear words sing in their heads, poetry helps them to experience this magic. Too often children are asked to find similes, metaphors, examples of alliteration, onomatopoeia, etc and they couldn’t care less what the poem is about. Let’s leave all the analysis for later on and introduce poems as pleasure, fun and excitement, things to make you laugh, feel and think.
Playing by the book: What’s your opinion about the state of children’s poetry in the UK? Who are the up and coming children’s poets we should be looking out for?
Wendy Cooling: Children’s poetry is very strong at the moment but few publishers will publish it as they’re nervous of achieving the necessary sales. We need to be brave and to celebrate poetry. I’m very keen on James Carter and Rachel Rooney as well as more established poets like Michael Rosen, Benjamin Zephaniah, John Agard, Carol Ann Duffy, Roger McGough, Valerie Bloom, Judith Nicholls and many many more.
Playing by the book: This seems like an opportune moment to congratulate Rachel Rooney on making this year’s CLPE Poetry Award shortlist which was recently announced. And what about you? Do you write poetry yourself?
Wendy Cooling: I write myself but not for publication! It’s a great pleasure perhaps a personal indulgence in my case.
Playing by the book: Apart from All the Wild Wonders, what three other children’s poetry anthologies would you encourage us to seek out if we were looking at starting a home poetry library?
Wendy Cooling: There are many terrific anthologies to look at, one of my favourites is Adrian Mitchell‘s A Poem a Day, it’s a delight to dip into and perfect for families to look at together. A Caribbean Dozen edited by John Agard and Grace Nichols is special too. If you can’t go to the Caribbean this is the next best thing as it invites you to experience the rhythms and atmosphere of another land.
There’s nothing like a live poet though, listening to them read, or perform their own poems can be a great experience. Children love to perform their poems too but should only be encouraged to learn by heart poems they really want to remember for ever.
Playing by the book: I couldn’t agree more with you Wendy. Thank you.

oh this looks so lovely. I recently wrote a poem which I am trying to get published and a fellow blogger has been reading it to the children at here daughters school and they acted it out. SO wish I had been able to see it. Love poetry and children just adore it.

Great interview. Yes, I too would like to eavesdrop on the conversation between editor and illustrator where they don’t agree on what the poem is ‘saying’! That’s the beauty of poetry I guess – although my son is doing his GCSE English Literature exams this week and he knows to agree on the general consensus of what the poet means – for maximum marks!
