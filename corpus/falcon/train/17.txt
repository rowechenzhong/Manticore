Exhibit 2 - There were three of these, and they all immediately disappeared. This one held still long enough for me to get a craptastic picture. They stick to the floor, and almost look like they're skittering on their fins. It's kinda freaky looking.

Top I'm sure is a killi and the bottom ones are a type of stiphodon goby if I'm not mistaken.

You know what this tank needs? ........................ Crypts.
The top is either a stressed mosquitofish or a killifish topminnow thing, secong id a swamp darter I think both native to florida I have mosquitofish and plan to make my tank a native tank when I upgrade
Does the first one look like this? goldentop.jpg
It does! I know, crap pictures. She did say that she thought they were Floridian. Interesting that the only fish she truly didn't know how to identify is probably the kind I wanted to look into anyway :)
Ok first is a golden topminnow or at least that's what the pic was labeld as, second is a swamp darter I think
After looking at pictures of gobies, I'm pretty sure you're right about those too. Hopefully they'll get a bit bigger or start coming out a bit more so I can get a good look at them, hehe.
Yeah I would get some florida plants for that tank, the other fish in the pic of the last fish is a black lined killifish

Massive improvement over Windows 8, massive improvement on all other versions of Windows, free,
Against
The Modern UI will cause problems for some, many Windows 8 apps are still utterly hopeless
Windows 8 continues to be a product that attracts a lot of complaining. Some of that complaining is justified - at least to some extent - and some of it isn't. But no matter what we think of Windows 8, if the customers aren't on board, then the operating system has no chance.
Microsoft seems happy though, W8 is selling well enough, although it's unlikely to eclipse Windows 7 anytime soon. And you know what, that's fine. If you like Windows 7, then don't upgrade unless you know Windows 8 is something you want in your life. After all, something that's not broken is better left that way.
But, what you all want to know is what does 8.1 add to the Windows world, and should you upgrade to it, or use this as the time to move over to Windows 8. We managed to get access to the full, final release a bit ahead of its official release, and here are our thoughts.
People, music and email apps updated, mixed results
In Windows 8, the "People" app was horrible. It still is, but they've tidied it do it doesn't look like your address book was sick on a brightly coloured jumper anymore.
The new email app is better, it looks more like a real email client, but we don't see non-tablet users making much use of it, because it forces you into an fullscreen mode - unless you use the new resizable multitasking mode to consign it to the left or right of the screen.
The music app too, is brilliant now. Its layout is clear and easy to navigate and things are split up far more logically. It's called Xbox Music, which makes some sense if you subscribe to the music service, but none at all if you don't own a console, or subscribe. What it does do, is present your collections of music well, and give you access to radio stations. Everyone now gets 10 hours of free streaming per month too.
MS has also added some new apps, like a sound recorder and calculator that use the Modern UI. The calculator is good, and the sound recorder does what it's supposed to, but neither really needs to be a full screen app.
The on-screen keyboard has matured too, with better access to special characters by pressing and holding a button.
Best third-party apps
To save you some time, the Facebook official app for 8.1 looks great, and will suit those on touchscreens. The Netflix app was amazing in 8, and hasn't really changed here, it's perfect really, and suits fullscreen as that's mostly how you would use a video app. The Sky News app is also worth looking at, and you can stream live Sky News through it too, which is nice to see.
We also really like Hyper, which is a YouTube app. It's free, and gives you massive control over how you view videos. It uses your profile to present video you want to see, and you can lock the quality to 1080p if you want, which the YouTube website refuses to allow.
Updates automatically
Previously, when apps updated they would prompt you to install them, but usually only when you opened the store. If you never opened the store, you might be running out of date apps for a long time. This has now changed, and apps will update in the background. We haven't tested this, but presumably if you tell Windows you're on an metered connection, it will be smart enough to disable this. If not, you can do it yourself.
Search fixed
Search drove us mad before. This was, in fact, the stupidest decision MS had made. Because typing would search apps, but not, say, configuration options. So if you typed "Windows Update" you would get no results, unless you selected the "settings" group on the right of the screen. This was tedious, and we're very pleased to see it has been sorted now.
Search is, in general, much better too. As well as being better for finding what you want, it will also search the web in a sensible manner. Search for Windows Update, and you get the app, the website and common users searches from Bing. That's far more like the approach we wanted microsoft to take with Windows 8 from the start.
Windows 8 reviewed simply
Here is the deal with Windows 8. We've been using it for ages. Through the beta phase, into the pre-release window where journalists had access to formulate their reviews. It has also been our main OS since launch, on the desktop machine on which these words are being written. And this isn't a touchscreen either, it's a standard twin-monitor desktop.
What have our findings been? Well, the Start Screen is no problem at all. We don't use it. We don't really use Metro apps, it's really just there for when we want to search for something. It's a bit pointless, but it's really no worse of different than any other way to find apps. If you customise it, then it can be useful. If you like full-screen applications, or watch a lot of Netflix, then the whole thing is great.
Many, many people have moaned about the new interface. Honestly, we really don't know why. Aside from Microsoft's insistence that it remove the Start button, and then fail to clearly indicate to anyone how they get back to that interface, it's actually a pretty way to deal with things. We like live tiles, they can be a great way of seeing what's going on in various apps.
Developers, developers, developers...
...As Balmer screeched as he monkeyed across the stage at Mix '08 in an incident that is mocked since. But the fact is, never has a more appropriate endorsement been made. Developers are all that matters on a computer OS. Without them, the whole thing will just die - sometimes it will struggle, even with them.
Windows 8 has not, if you ask us, had a massive influx of great developers pushing the Modern UI as far as it could be pushed. The fact is, most Modern apps are rubbish. Look at Twitter's, man alive that app sucks so immensely hard it risks pulling the moon into the surface of the planet. The same is true for apps like Skype, it looks like a bit of a joke, and it works nothing like the desktop app, there are masses of essential features missing. It's fine on tablets, but if you're on a desktop, both are going to give you a really bad impression of Windows 8.
What the new UI offers is full screen apps that put graphical content first. Massive images look fantastic, so where are the apps that make use of this? The 500px app is nice, well worth checking out, but none of them seem to have the balance and quality control right. These apps have great potential, but they're not managed or curated well, so what you end up with is a quite amateur looking.
So, for all that mocking of Steve Balmer and his ape-act, perhaps he should get on it again and enthuse the developer community about Windows 8 apps.
Return of the Start Button
For some, the removal of the Start button was too much. It's somewhat amazing that in the 18 years since the Start button was introduced, users have got so used to it that its removal from Windows 8 caused a near-global meltdown. Happily, it's back. But the problem for some is that the Start Menu is still a thing of the past, and pressing the all-new button just flips you to the Start screen. But, this still solves a major usability issue in Windows 8, namely the uncertainty about how to get back "home" once you landed on the desktop.
But, Microsoft has also improved how the Start screen works. firstly, you can now name groups. For some reason this makes us happy, and it feels a bit like the old Start menu, because that too allowed named groups. How you work this is up to you, but we have common apps close to the left, and then have groups along with the more commonly used ones on screen where you can see them quickly.
The key improvement though, is that you can now swipe the Start screen upwards, to reveal all of your apps below. This means that your Start screen doesn't get cluttered. Apps are not installed there by default, you have to pin them there, which is great because it gives you control and makes it easier to keep a neat home screen.
There are still problems, for example, you have no choice where they are pinned, so you have to move them to a location that suits you once you've selected the ones you want pinned. The good news is that you can move more than one app at a time.
Boot to desktop
Those who don't see the point of booting into the modern UI can ignore it, and go straight into the desktop mode. This makes sense for desktop and non-touchscreen users, and we think it will be popular.
Should I upgrade?
If you're a Windows 8 user, then absolutely. There are massive advances being made here and there is pretty much no reason not to upgrade. It is free, after all.
If you're on Windows XP, Windows Vista or Windows 7, we'd say you need to think carefully about what it will mean for you. If you think you might enjoy the new interface, then go for it. And remember, Windows 8 is a faster OS than any of the previous versions, so for that reason upgrading is well worthwhile.
If your PC is older, it's also well worth checking the specs to make sure yours is powerful enough to cope with it, but you knew that already, didn't you.
Verdict
No doubt lots of people will say that.
Don't listen to the hype about it being a disaster. Like Windows Vista, Microsoft's latest OS has been maligned by those who didn't like the change in interface. That doesn't make them right, and while we accept that Windows 8 does make things different, remember how much fuss there was when Microsoft started with the Start button? Or the move from Windows as a GUI, to a proper NT Kernel-based operating system. Those were all massive changes to the very foundation of Windows too.Amprepair.co.uk

"Our non-conference schedule will also provide us with a good test and get us ready for the Sun Belt Conference".
The 14 home games for the Mean Green are the most at home since the 1995-96 season. North Texas has dominated at the Super Pit over the past seven seasons with a record of 62-19.
The non-conference schedule is highlighted by home games against SMU and UTEP, a battle with Boston College in the New Hampshire Classic, along with a road game at Texas.
North Texas will open the 2005-06 season with two home games against Stephen F. Austin and Southern Arkansas. The Mean Green will then travel to Durham, New Hampshire to take on Boston College in the first round of the New Hampshire Tournament.
North Texas begins Sun Belt Conference play on January 5 at New Orleans. North Texas will play seven SBC home games, highlighted by a five-game homestand beginning with conference newcomer Troy.
North Texas will host defending conference champion Middle Tennessee on February 8 in the final home game of the season before embarking on a four-game road trip to conclude the regular season.
The 2006 SBC Tournament will be hosted by Middle Tennessee and played March 3-7.

An easy to follow, step-by-step breakdown of how to change a diaper. Because sometimes, you just need the facts:
Step 1
Grab your changing gear and find a clean, flat surface to change baby on. The floor works just as well as a changing table, but make sure that your little one is lying on a changing pad or blanket that is easily washable and keeps germs at bay.
Step 2
Open the diaper and assess the damage. For messy diapers, it’s a good idea to wipe up the mess before completely removing the diaper, so you can contain the yucky wipes inside the diaper with the poop, making it a little less messy. To close the diaper before disposing, roll it up and use the sticky tabs to secure in a little bundle.
Step 3
Make sure when you’re cleaning baby’s bottom that you do so thoroughly—wipe between all the creases and rolls to ensure that you’re not leaving behind any possible germs.
Step 4
Slide a clean diaper underneath your baby, with the sticky tabs facing you. If you need to apply diaper cream, now is the best time to do it. (You might need another wipe or a wet cloth to clean your hands after application.) Pull up the front of the diaper and secure it comfortably around baby’s waist.
Step 5
Dispose of the old diaper in a diaper pail, but don’t leave baby unattended on the changing table to do so—it only takes a second for baby to make a sudden movement, and you don’t want to take any chances.
Step 6
Pick baby up and pat yourself on the back—you just changed a diaper!
Gender games
All parts aren’t created equally when it comes to boys and girls—both require a little specialist care.
Boys will be boys
Word of warning: When air hits a little boy’s bottom, he’s likely to shoot a stream straight at you. Give his penis a quick air of freedom and then re-cover it to keep yourself out of the line of fire or use a super cute Pee-pee Teepee, specially designed to keep moms everywhere free from pee.
An uncircumcised little boy’s penis doesn’t require any extra care—just keep it clean and be sure not to push back the foreskin. If your son was circumcised, you’ll need to apply pure petroleum jelly to the area at each diaper change and most doctors recommend wrapping the penis in gauze as well, until it begins to heal. Gently pushing back the skin so it doesn’t reattach is also recommended. The best way to know exactly what to do and how long to do it is to ask a nurse to show you before you leave the hospital—they’re pros, and good nurses never mind helping new moms.
Good, clean girls
When it comes to rolls and creases, girls can be a bit more of a challenge to keep tidy. When cleaning your daughter’s bottom, remember the “front to back” rule. Wiping in the other direction could cause painful (and unnecessary) urinary tract infections.
Rash rules
Got diaper rash? Try the following tips:
- Baby wipes might sting a rash-y area, so use warm washcloths to clean baby’s bottom instead.
- Let your little one’s bottom dry completely before refastening his diaper—and for persistent rashes, having a little “air” time on a waterproof mat might expedite recovery.
- Cloth diapers are known for their rash-reducing power—if your baby has a sensitive bottom, consider going cloth.
- Many moms swear that using a petroleum-based rash ointment on a regular basis prevents rashes from showing up at all.NASCAR superstar Tony Stewart took some time out of his busy schedule to visit six race fans who were injured during Saturday’s heart stopping wreck.
The fans were injured when a massive crash sent debris flying into the stands during the last lap of the NASCAR Nationwide Series event at Daytona International Speedway.
Shortly after the Daytona 500 ended, Tony Stewart traveled to the Halifax Health Medical Center. Stewart arrived at approximately 8 pm and stayed until just after 10 pm.
Stewart didn’t want to go public with his good deed and only confirmed the visit after an inquiry was placed.
According to reports, Tony Stewart visited with each of the injured fans on a one-on-one basis. Stewart even gave each NASCAR fan a personally signed Bass Pro Shops No. 14 cap.
The race drivers team says it was Stewart’s decision to make the trek to Halifax Health Medical Center.
Following the horrific accident Stewart went on to win at the track for his seventh time in nine years, tying him with Dale Earnhardt for the most wins at the track.
During his win, Tony Stewart was quick to turn attention towards his fellow drivers and fans, noting:

Fourteen fans were sent to Halifax Health, but only six remained under observation when Tony Stewart had arrived.

IN THE MOVIE business in Asia, it has long been standard technique to set aside $10 million for special effects and $10 for a script.
That's all going to change now that a Hong Kong film story ("The Departed") has swept the Oscars in Hollywood. Several more HK movie scripts have been purchased by Hollywood, so this is a good time for writers here to produce their screenplays. I'm hoping to get a screenwriters "cell-group" going in Hong Kong next month. If anyone is interested, click here for details: I want to be a screenwriter.

Critics will loathe Eragon. I guarantee that the vast majority will slam it.
But it is actually not the disaster they say it is. In the same way that they misunderstood The Da Vinci Code movie, they will misunderstand Eragon.
The first thing they will say is: "Hey, this is a Star Wars rip-off"! Ignore their bleating. It would make sense only if you do not realize that Star Wars itself was quite possibly the most derivative film in history, if you don't count deliberate spoofs and pastiches.
Secondly, they will say: "Hey, there are elves and things, so this is a Lord of the Rings rip-off". This comment would only make sense if you did not realize that the whole sword and sorcery scene pre-dated Tolkien by many decades.

Sitting in the front row of a Monroe courtroom -- surrounded by family and friends -- she couldn't bear to look at the television screen. It showed the inside of her sister, Kim Daniels', home in Santa Claus the morning of Dec. 4, 1997, about seven hours after Kim, 33, her husband, Danny, 47, and their two children, Jessica, 16, and Bryant, 8, died from shotgun blasts as they slept in their beds.
''They're in Bryant's room now,'' whispered Amy Tomberlin, a best friend from church, into Smith's ear.
The video camera panned through young Bryant's room, showing the bunk beds where he and brother, Corey, 4, slept. A toy truck on the floor near a shotgun shell and a boy's jacket. A closet with boys' clothes and a bowling pin on the floor.
And blood. Splattered on the walls next to the bed, near a framed photo of Bryant in a red baseball cap holding a bat. The boy's arm poked out from beneath a sheet on the top bunk bed.
Smith, 33, grasped a tissue and wiped her eyes, still keeping her head down. Across the courtroom, the man accused of killing the Daniels' family also kept his head down, staring at a spot on the gray-blue rug in front of him for hours on end.
Jerry Scott Heidler, 22, sat solitary at the defense table as his lawyers, the prosecutors and observers moved over to the other side of the room and gathered around a single television that showed the carnage he is accused of causing. Though offered the opportunity, he declined to view the gruesome video.
Kim and Danny Daniels lying in their bed, shot dead, beneath a white comforter with light blue flowers. Jessica, face-down in her nightgown on the steps leading down to the bedroom between a desk with a calculator and a dresser with socks and diapers and other clutter on top.
Shotgun shells strewn throughout the house, two near Jessica, one in the bathroom leading into the master bedroom where the family's bodies were found: one in a small garden tub in the master bedroom, one in the laundry room, another in Bryant's room, still another on the couch in the living room beneath a plastic pitcher. A Marlboro cigarette mashed into the floor near the back door with saliva on it that matches Heidler's DNA.
Kim was shot two times, once in the stomach, another time in the arm, medical experts testified. Danny may have been shot four times. A bullet to the head finally killed him. Jessica was shot once in the back of the head. Bryant was shot once in the head. Death for the two children was instantaneous, medical experts said. Kim and Danny may have lived for a matter of minutes.
The video moved to an aerial view of the brick house with the cornflower blue shutters located between a pond and larger lagoon lined by trees. Finally, Smith looked up at the television. The home where the Daniels lived with seven children, many of them foster children, is in a pastoral setting at the end of a dirt road in the tiny town of Santa Claus in Toombs County.
But Smith could not shield herself from the little girl on the video who told of being abducted from her home and sodomized by Heidler in a van at the Altamaha River that same night. The girl said Heidler, known to her as Scott Taylor, woke her up that morning, holding a shotgun.
He said a burglar had broken into the house and Kim Daniels had told him to take her away. Heidler then got two of the other Daniels' girls to come with him. He took the trio, ages 8, 9 and 10, in a van for a drive that ended beneath a bridge at the Altamaha River.
In a little girl's voice, the child described how Heidler got out for a while and then returned. He drove to the top of the bridge and threw the shotgun into the water, she said.
Then he drove some more and dropped the girls on a dirt road on the outskirts of Alma, Heidler's hometown.
Asked if any of the girls had been harmed by Heidler, the girl paused.
Then she started crying and buried her head in her arms. Only willing to confide her story to a woman from the Department of Children and Family Services, a male Georgia Bureau of Investigation agent left the room. Then the girl, with little emotion and obvious discomfort, told her story.
Smith, friends and other family members of the Daniels and even a few jury members shed tears to varying degrees as the child described Heidler's actions that night.
Prosecutors offered some insight on Tuesday into a possible motive for the slayings. Guy Aaron, Danny Daniels' best friend, said Daniels was concerned that a relationship had sprung up between his daughter and Heidler. Heidler's sister, Jo Anna Mosley, was a foster child in the Daniels' home for six weeks, and the Daniels tried to help her troubled brother also, Aaron said.
''At times, Kim and Danny felt sorry for him,'' Aaron said. ''They were out to help people. Scott (Heidler) happened to be one of those people.''
Guy said even he had seen Jessica and Heidler together on the steps of the house.
''You could tell something was beginning to take place, how people get close to one another,'' Aaron said.
Daniels told Aaron he was concerned because of the age difference between Heidler and Jessica. Several months before the murders took place, Danny Daniels told Heidler to stay away from the home.
''After that I didn't see him no more,'' said Aaron, who went hunting with Daniels and saw or talked to him almost every day.
Athens, GA ? Athens Banner-Herald © 2015. All Rights Reserved. | Terms of Service | Privacy Policy / About Our Ads | Content Removal PolicyTIGNISH -- Saskatchewan author Beverly Brenna will be touring Prince Edward Island and reading from her books during TD Children’s Book Week May 3 to 10.
Brenna, who has authored 10 books including The White Bicycle, a 2013 Printz Honor title, and her latest book, The Bug House Family Restaurant, will give three public readings, May 5 from 10:30 to 11:30 a.m. at the Confederation Centre’s Children’s Library and 1 to 2 p.m. at Leona Giddings Memorial Library in Murray River, and May 7, 9:30 to 10:30 a.m. at Tignish Public Library.
The author tour planned for this year’s TD Children’s Book Week gives Island youth an opportunity to meet a real life author and hear that author tell her story in her own voice,” acknowledged Tourism and Culture minister Robert Henderson. “It’s a great way to promote a love of books and to encourage parents to take an active role in their children’s reading habits.”
Besides the public readings, Brenna will visit seven Island schools during the week, reading to students and staff there. The school stops start May 5 at West Kent Elementary School from 9 a.m. to 10 a.m.
She will visit Montague Consolidated on Tuesday and has stops Wednesday at Hernewood Intermediate School and John J. Sark Memorial School at 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. respectively. She visited Somerset Elementary on Thursday at 10:45 a.m.. Brenna completes her school visits on Friday, May 9 with a 10:15 a.m. stop at Souris Consolidated and 1:50 p.m. at Morell Regional High.Still trying to find the time to sit down and write a summation of the Big Island Chronicle Candidates Forum and Debates held Saturday, Aug. 7, 2010 at the Akebono Theater. Â In the meantime, I want to point out to you that Dave Corrigan, with Big Island Video News, has coverage of the event posted on his blog and I strongly urge you to check it out here and here. Mahalo nui loa, Dave! A round of applause for Big Island Video News! Baron Sekiya of Hawaii247.com also videoed some of the forum and debates and, when that coverage is up on that site, I’ll let you know.
You can also check out the live blogging from Bruce Albrecht at the event here andÂ here andÂ here andÂ here andÂ here andÂ here and here andÂ here andÂ here andÂ here and here and here and here andÂ here and here and here and here and here and here and here (more links when I have time). I can’t thank everyone enough for the participation and all the help that went into making this a very successful and informative event. Individual thank yous will be saved for my summation to come. Folks interested in local politics should know Malama O Puna is hosting a candidates’ debate at the Pahoa Neighborhood Facility (Puna Community Center) at 6 p.m., Wednesday, Aug. 18, 2010.
Below are my lengthy notes written up during the event:
August 13th, 2010 at 6:52 am
Thanks for doing this mega task.
To be sure I had heard it correctly, I checked your notes and found that indeed my hearing had not failed me.
Barbara Lively stated that she and I “…are very like-minded.” Then she went on to say that we â€œ…think a likeâ€¦â€
However, I pointed out that, while we may be like-minded, a big difference is that I have more experience to put to work in Council. Barbara then said, â€œVoters here spoke loud and clear when voted out the last person who looked like him [referring to me, James Weatherford] and thought like himâ€¦â€ What is that supposed to mean?
August 13th, 2010 at 8:21 am
Hi James,
The latter comment, I think the last comment of the day, was VERY disappointing to hear. I couldn’t believe it was said. I actually would like Barbara Lively to expound on that. In my mind, we shouldn’t be electing anyone into office who want to perpetuate racism. To be honest, I felt that comment was very racist. This is 2010. Most of us are comprised of mixed races and descents.
Also, regarding the reference that you are like Gary Safarik, I couldn’t disagree more. First of all, Safarik is Czech and Greek. Didn’t you say you are part Creek Indian, James?
Safarik’s ethnic background is not only different than yours, I think his politics are as well.
I was very disappointed that Lively through that b.s. out there, because I otherwise like her.
On a separate note, I have to say that all you politicians lining up on the side of Highway 130 is totally annoying. I was thinking about sign-waving for one of my favorite candidates, but decided against it when I saw everyone lined up yesterday.
First, it’s a major distraction and a safety hazard and I think there should be a law against it.
Second, it’s just totally annoying. We drivers are slowed to a crawl trying to merge from multiple lanes into one, thinking about how LAME our State Departmemt of Transportation is, and here are our political candidates and supporters are smiling and waving us.
I can’t help think, when I see you folks smiling and waving at us, you’re all co
pletely worthless.
Then, I’m also hot and tired and annoyed that I’m trying to navigate a total ness of a bottleneck.
I think it is terrible that politicians wave like that on the side of the road.
I can’t even believe Faye Hanohano has the nerve to stand there, when she has done nothing to help with the mess.
Where is the reversible or contraflow lane, Faye?!
Would someone please introduce legislation banning politicians from waving on the side of the road?
Politicians should win elections by door-to-door campaigning and engaging in community forums and debates, not distracting drivers like clowns.
August 13th, 2010 at 9:53 am
Race and ethnicity are never far below the surface in Big Island politics . . . and just about anywhere else in Hawaii. Although repugnant, it’s sort of refreshing that someone comes virtually right out in the open with a remark like that. It brings home the reality. In this case it’s Barbara Lively, someone who, IMHO, does not have a real shot at getting elected. It’s the ones who feel the same way, but are smart enough not to say it openly that really worry me. Unfortunately, quite a few of this latter, sneakier group manage to get elected.
As for sign waving, all I can say is “choose your battles wisely.” I agree that it is quite annoying and even potentially dangerous, but it isn’t going to change anytime soon. I try to use that indignant energy to pursue something more attainable that won’t get me accused of trying to destroy aloha.
August 13th, 2010 at 10:26 am
I’ve felt the same way about political sign wavers for years. My knee-jerk impulse is to veer off the road and see how many of these irritants I might be able to eliminate from the gene pool with the bumper of my truck, (no reflection on Mr. Weatherford). It is sad that this is the depth to which our electoral process has degenerated.
August 13th, 2010 at 10:36 am
Tiff and Jerry,
Thanks for the feedback re sign waving.
As a driver, I live with it.
As a voter, I’ve never used it to decide who to or not to vote for.
As a volunteer on other candidates’ campaigns in previous elections, I have never taken the opportunity to do it.
As a candidate, I have been persuaded by a majority of supporters that sign waving is essential to be seen and be recognized (which are necessary steps in raising awareness and getting people to act on a voting preference).
Lots of folks seem to have come to expect it. The response to my campaign has been better each time.
About Keaau bypass as a sign waving place. Not my favorite. Indeed, have been looking for better places and would welcome creative suggestions.
August 13th, 2010 at 10:44 am
Yes, Tiff, I am descended from the Creek (‘Muscogee’) tribe, and have Anglo and Franco ancestors.
Besides really not seeing how Gary and I look much alike, much less how we think alike, what seemed most perplexing was for Barbara to claim at one point the she and I “think alike” and then to try and put me down because I “think like” someone else (presumably Gary Safarik).
Anyway, ever onward …
August 13th, 2010 at 10:50 am
…it occurs to me that more opportunities for voters to become aware of candidates — such as the forum last Saturday, and the one this Wednesday, 6pm, Pahoa Neighborhood Center — would obviate the need to do sign waving.
August 13th, 2010 at 11:25 am
Tiffany was great at catching the highlights. I was just saying yesterday I was shocked and taken aback by the statements made at the end. It was not only all that she said, the highlights of which are above, but the body language that went with the words. I understood it might have been a defensive knee jerk but when you panned the audience still sitting there at the end of the day they looked alot like the ‘grey haired’ man as opposed to the current district rep who ‘looks like Barbara’. Wrong crowd to make that analogy too. And at the end of the day, that particular closing comment might have undone all the positive she brought to the table all the rest of the day. Fortunately, by then, much of the crowd had departed and will only remember her positive testimony.
I am always surprised when I hear any sort of comment alluding to ethnicity which might be construed as a negative when everyone generally comments to the beauty of diversity. I think the one thing that will work in Barbara’s favor is the fact that her mentor and strong supporter for the district 5 seat is a man who himself has ‘grey hair’ and was voted out from his district and replaced with Guy, someone who looks like Barbara.
I enjoyed listening to both James and Barbara.
There was a candidate from each group whose energy was big … Solomon, Michael and Barbara.
Now, if Barbara meant James and Gary resemble each other based on ‘gender’ and she and Emily resemble each other based on ‘gender’ then I am good with that!!

Just a plug for our forum tomorrow afternoon at 4P here in Hawaiian Shores [ ] where the 4 State House reps will face off once again. Setting is outside.. just off pool side….at the Hawaiian Shores Community Recreational facility on Honu Street. Turn right on Honu off Kahakai Blvd .. proceed through the stop sign…the park is half way down the street on the left. We will be taking questions from the audience…written down and submitted… Hope to see you there…
August 13th, 2010 at 12:01 pm
Toni,
Do you have any use for the signs with all the candidates’ names? I don’t want to have to throw them away… I also called Rene Siracusa to see if she can use them for the Wednesday forum…
August 13th, 2010 at 5:08 pm
Hi Tiff, Thank you so much for offering…I am actually making the signs for tomorrow’s event and then we will have no further forums in our area. Perhaps Renee can use them. I truly appreciate your off though.
August 13th, 2010 at 5:30 pm
certainly, if you look at all the candidates who were there during the day, it really was quite a rainbow of different people…young, old, some born and raised in the islands, some not…a wide range of ethnic back grounds too…not too many other places would have that kind of melting pot…one of the things that make this place special…

He is not even the greatest US Olympian of all time. He is the greatest swimmer of all time and he does have the most medals in Olympic history. Those are facts and they are indisputable. However, the greatest Olympian of all time is Carl Lewis.
Carl Lewis, the track and field superstar, is the greatest Olympian of all time for several reasons. First, Lewis qualified for 5 Olympic teams. He was denied the possibility of competing in the 1980 Olympic Games in Moscow because of the US boycott. However, he went on to compete in four other Olympiads: Los Angeles 1984; Seoul 1988; Barcelona 1992; and Atlanta 1996.
Second, Carl Lewis won nine gold medals and a silver medal over the course of those four Olympic Games. Carl Lewis only competed for 10 Olympic medals over those four Olympics. 90% gold is a pretty good success rate. It could have been higher but the 4x100m relay team dropped a baton in qualifying for the 1988 finals; which cost Lewis an almost assured gold.
Third, Lewis is the only person to ever defend a 100m gold medal and a long jump gold medal. He won the 1984 gold medal in the 100m and then repeated in 1988 after a controversial race where it turned out that Ben Johnson, the original winner, was disqualified for steroids. Lewis also won the long jump gold in those two Olympiads and then again in 1992 and again in 1996.
Lewis is one of three athletes ever to win one event, the long jump, in four straight Olympics. The other two are Danish sailor Paul Elvstrom and American discuss thrower Al Oerter. The long jump is obviously a much more impressive event to repeat four times and again, it could’ve been five if he was allowed to compete in 1980.
Fourth, Carl Lewis equaled the achievements of the legendary sprinter Jesse Owens from the 1936 Berlin games where he won four gold medals; 100m; 200m; long jump; and 4x100m relay. Lewis did this in Los Angeles in 1984.
Lewis’ 1984 four gold medal achievement is essentially the equal of Michael Phelps historic eight gold medals at 2008 Beijing. Phelps also had six gold and two bronzes at the 2004 Athens Games and has since won two more gold in London 2012 and counting. However, he also didn’t medal in an event and got silver in two other events. Plus in 2000 Sydney, he didn’t win a medal, albeit he was only 15 and the youngest man to qualify for the Olympic swim team in 68 years.
Swimming gives many more chances to win each Olympiad and swimming is easier to sustain over a longer period of time. Plus a swimmer can start earlier. For instance, Phelps qualified at 15 or on the women’s side, remember Janet Evans, who started by winning three gold medals at 16 in Seoul.
Michael Phelps records are amazing, they really are. However, I cannot say that he is the greatest Olympian or even US Olympian of all time. Carl Lewis has to be considered the greatest for his consistency throughout four Olympiads and the fact that he was robbed of a chance at a fifth. Not to mention, he really should be credited with bringing the Olympics back to the forefront of the American people.
The 1968 Mexico City Olympics are best remembered for the controversial black power salute by Tommie Smith and John Carlos on the medal stand; which turned many people off. 1972 was forever marred by the killing of the Israeli Olympians in Munich. Montreal 1976 was generally considered the worst Olympics in history and 1980 in Moscow was a US boycott.
If you’re an Olympic historian like me, then there are really only two lasting images of the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics. Those are Mary Lou Retton winning gold in Gymnastics and of course, the great Carl Lewis equaling the record of the iconic Jesse Owens who won four gold medals in the face of Hitler in 1936 at Berlin.
Carl Lewis made the Olympics in Los Angeles and he unfortunately along with Ben Johnson made them in Seoul in 1988. What else can you remember from the 1988 Games? Matt Biondi and Janet Evans? Roy Jones Jr. getting screwed by the judges in a boxing match? The US men’s basketball team losing? 99% of people have no recollection of those events but they remember the Carl Lewis and Ben Johnson race and the subsequent disqualification.
When Lewis won the gold in long jump and the relay in Barcelona 1992 it was great. However, when he reached down deep and won the long jump in 1996 at age 35 in Atlanta where he had no business winning, it cemented him as the greatest Olympian ever. His feats will be tough to equal.
It is tough to compare sports, especially when there are so many more opportunities to win in swimming. The Soviets can also claim the best Olympians were their gymnasts back when they were pumping them full of steroids but I don’t think so.
Carl Lewis is the greatest Olympian of all time and perhaps the greatest athlete of all time (He was actually drafted by the Chicago Bulls of the NBA and the Dallas Cowboys of the NFL but never played in either league). If you don’t think so, let’s see whom the USOC picks to light the flame at the next Olympics in the United States. I’ll bet the house its Lewis and not Phelps.
I agree 100%, another interesting Olympian is Clara Hughes of Canada who has won 6 total medals in both the Winter and Summer Olympic Games. Just an interesting story, considering her impact with the charity Right To Play.
She is an interesting story I agree but obviously not in the same discussion as greatest of all time…I like the Canada love though!
Phelps is still one of the best, can’t argue that. I do have a bias towards my fellow Marylander….
Clearly he is right up there, I have him right behind Lewis but for the reasons I listed I go with Lewis. I also don’t think Phelps is the most significant swimmer, I give that to Spitz but more for the geo political stuff rather than greatness. You can’t argue that Phelps is the best swimmer ever…and yes being from MD is pretty cool
You really make some good points here…good story
Thanks John!
You make some good points but simply put, 20 medals and 16 golds is tough to argue against…I go with Phelps
It’s a string case I agree obviously. However, as I said in the post, there are way more opportunities to win in swimming and Lewis is batting 90% in gold with the events he entered and competed for medals. The other was a silver…not too shabby
Did you research this stuff or did you just know it?
I just know it…I’m pretty good with sports stuff, especially Olympics
I think you are discounting the political importance of Jesse Owens in 1936 in the face of Hitler. I think that makes him the greatest Olympian ever.
I did mention that and I agree it was important. The difference as Owens only won in 1 Olympics in 1936. Granted they were cancelled the next two times for WWII but still. Those stories of Owens are legendary I agree but only go so far and are perhaps exaggerated with the right in the face of Hitler stuff. Lewis built his standing over a long period of time and was consistent over such a long period of time
It seems that people get so shortsighted with what is happening in the present and forget what has happened in the past. It is kind of the same with how people say LeBron james is as good or better than Jordan. Did everyone forget how amazing he was? I blame the internet and all the talk shows. Lewis is definitely the best Olympian. Nothing against Phelps but Lewis was timeless.
Well said Stephen
Great arguments Lee…you’ve got me on board but I don’t know too much about the Olympics history. I do know that Phelps is a beast but Lockte is pretty cute!
Haha, I can’t speak on that but they are both beasts
I agree about Carl Lewis but I think you aren’t giving enough credit to Mark Spitz and what he dealt with in Munich as a Jew when the Israeli team was taken hostage and killed.
Correct me if I’m wrong Jeremy but the hostage situation and subsequent killings were right after swimming wrapped and Spitz got his 7th gold medal. If I am not mistaken, as soon as that happened SPitz was taken out of Munich for his protection so I don’t think he actually dealt with much as far as threats during his amazing run in swimming that Olympiad as it happened right after. Spitz was still incredibly important in that Olympics as a Jew but not as a direct result of performing under fire so to speak.
You are only focusing on American athletes. What about the great Russian gymnasts you vaguely mentioned? What about the Romanian women gymnasts? Norwegian skiers? Etc etc.
I think you’re missing the point here with some of these. The Romanian women were great individually for a long time and still can be but side from Nadia Comaneci who scored the perfect 10 in 1976, who else can you name? Not only that but how many Olympics did they win at…exactly 1. The Russian gymnasts led by Larissa Latynina are the ones you can argue the best because they won so many medals but again…a different sport with many more opportunities to win than a sprinter/long jumper at a given Olympiad. The Norwegian skiers are great but not in the same ballpark.
Perhaps it is a Canadian bias (when there was some hope that Ben Johnson was telling the truth), but it has been a long held belief in this country that Carl was equally complicit in using performance enhancing drugs throughout his career — and was caught using a ‘masking’ substance shortly before Seoul. I don’t have an opinion (or really care), and perhaps it was a crutch the Canadian media was using, to soften the blow of such embarrasement (Ben Johnson). Even now, during this Olympics, I have read references to the suspicion that surrounds Carl Lewis.
#preparingforhatemailfromamericansonthisthread
Haha, Mr. Gilroy…In 2003 it was revealed that Lewis tested positive three times before the 1988 Olympics for some banned stimulants found in cold medication, and had been banned from the Seoul Olympics and from competition for six months. The USOC accepted his claim of inadvertent use and overturned the decision.
That was a slight blow but those stimulants were not performance enhancing like Johnson’s were. Johnson had been a known doper for years and all the athletes knew about it. Lewis, to his credit, raced uphill against a known cheater and never actually took roids. He lost in 1987 Worlds which I remember like it was yesterday and then originally in the Olympics…The IOC got it right…the Canadian media is salty as always even back then! It was a fun story and still is to talk about.
I have to agree with what you’ve said. I live and have lived in LA for 40 years and when Carl Lewis won those gold medals in the Olympics in 1984, it was like the Lakers winning when they had Show Time.
I can just imagine…it must’ve been awesome…how about that Kings Stanley Cup-not quite the same huh?!
Like the way of thinking but disagree on a few points. Phelps was 19 when he competed in his first Olympics, Lewis would have been 20, as you said it was Moscow and it it is hard to say what if but it really isn’t a big age difference. And you do currently have an 18 year old track and field Olympian athlete competing for the US. Also really disagree with the argument that swimming is all the same. Backstroke is entirely different from breaststroke which is from butterfly etc. Yes you’re in the pool for all of them but they do require a different skillset and physical strengths (and I speak from competitive experience here) and you’re not automatically good at one if you are at the other. Lewis competed in long jump from the start, he actually started running after, not the other way round (albeit not at the Olympics), point is it wasn’t something he just picked up to give it a go. Also for me it is part of the same family, it is all part of track and field and if you can group all the swim styles then an athlete who can run can also jump etc, that’s why you have hepathalons et al. It takes a lot of guts and stamina to compete in everything you can, Lewis had the chance to compete in a lot more but didn’t. For me a true Olympian needs guts and stamina even more than a clean medal statistic because that’s the spirit. Lewis was amazing of course and what no one can take away from him is that he put TF on the map in the States when no one really cared about it and he believed in the sport but you can’t hold it against Phelps that swimming is already popular! Also Lewis no longer holds any Olympic records, only time will tell with Phelps of course but still.
Hey Franzi…Phelps was 15 when he competed in Sydney 2000 and Lewis would have been 19 in Moscow 1980-Fact.
Lewis also ran all the time but didn’t qualify for the Olympics in 1980 in the sprints because he wasn’t strong enough yet but was always a good jumper. Males mature physically at a later age which is why most sprinters are in mid 20’s when they hit their stride where as the swim muscles develop quicker-I don’t know but a lot more younger swimmers medal than track for both men and women, that’s a fact. The necessary muscles are different.
What you and Mike is his comment said was Lewis didn’t compete in enough events…you have to qualify for those events and he didn’t qualify for the sprints after Seoul except for the relay. He would have competed had he qualified, it’s when the US had guys like Michael Johnson and Leroy Burrell etc who were younger and faster by 1992 and 1996.
Lewis doesn’t have any Olympic records anymore no because records fall as athletes get bigger and faster….how many records will Phelps have in 8 years, probably none-that’s just the way it goes so that point is moot.
You are forgetting to point out Carl Lewis had a chance to win 16 medals if he competed in all his events at all of those olympics which if he didn’t win them would have hurt his percentage of gold wins, instead he chose to specialise in the ones he would win.
Phelps seems to pretty much enter almost everything he can. I do however find it hard to argue for anyone who wears a speedo for a living to be the best olympian of all time.
Lewis didn’t qualify for the sprints after 1988 which is why he didn’t compete because he was surpassed by the younger guys…wasn’t because he chose not to compete. Swimmers all compete in medleys and the best guys are good at all of them so makes sense for them compete in the independent events much like gymnasts do. Phelps declined a few events this as well.
Again, not disparaging Phelps in any way, he’s just not as great an Olympic athlete in my opinion for the reasons and facts I stated.
I think you make great arguments backed up by facts here Lee. I completely agree with you on the Lewis/Phelps thing although no disrespect to Phelps. The only other athlete that can even be in the conversation is Jim Thorpe…of course different era etc.
So many athletes have one great Olympics like FloJo, Bolt, Moses etc and then can’t sustain it. Lewis doing it in the LJ over 4 Olympics is pretty impressive especially when you say it’s one of three times that’s ever happened and one was sailing. I didn’t know sailing was a sport in the Olympics.
Ya it’s almost impossible to compare someone like Jim Thorpe to modern day athletes but I agree he was great and set Stockholm 1912 afire. I’ve actually been to that stadium which I thought was really cool.AMC First Colony 243301 Town Centre Blvd. South Sugar Land TX 7747:30PM, 7:10PM, 7:55PM, 8:40PM, 9:30PM, 10:15PM, 11:40PM

>.(CNN) -- Federal judges tentatively ruled on Monday that California must reduce the number of inmates in its overcrowded prison system by up to 40 percent to stop a constitutional violation of prisoners' rights.
California must cut the number of inmates in its prison system by up to 40 percent, judges have ruled.
"Overcrowding is the primary cause of the unconstitutional conditions that have been found to exist in the California prisons," the court concluded.
California state officials, including Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, immediately promised to appeal the case to the U.S. Supreme Court, if necessary.
"The governor and I strongly disagree with this ruling," said Matthew Cate, California's corrections and rehabilitation secretary. Implementing the court's ruling would result in up to 58,000 prisoners being released, Cate said, describing it as a threat to public safety.
He disputed the court's contention that the prisons are unsafe the way they are now.
But court documents, the judges said the state's prison system was at about 200 percent of capacity.
The ruling is the result of two class-action lawsuits on behalf of California prisoners who said medical and mental health care in the state's prisons are so inadequate that they violate the federal constitution's Eighth Amendment ban against cruel and unusual punishment.
The judges said their ruling is tentative so that the parties involved can plan accordingly, essentially giving them an opportunity to work things out themselves before an official ruling is rendered. The court suggests a two- to three-year window for reducing the number of prisoners in the system..
A final ruling also probably would reduce the number of people entering the prison system, with many being diverted through the courts and into rehabilitation programs instead of going to jail, Specter said.

Note::
We brought you this story in April, but since then, Robbie Hanchey's inspiring story of promoting music education in a struggling rural school has made its way across the country. This month, the School Band & Orchestra magazine profiled him in their cover story. With about 600 students in the small Idaho school, Hanchey had very few resources to support a music program. After three years, Hanchey's relentless work to recruit studetns and build support paid off. He now has nearly 100 students participating in his junior/high school band program, out of 250 students in the junior/high school. "I like to think that we’re now a bright example of how you can find a way to provide music for these kids," said Hanchey. "I can’t even imagine these kids not having music because they love it so much. I see all my sixth through 12th graders and I wonder what these kids would do if they didn’t have this, because right now it’s all they do."
While you may get tired of the endless "listicles" on social media – from "10 Best Recipes" to "15 Books to Read This Summer" – I think we found a list you will enjoy, and use! The National Association for Music Education (NAfME) has a new list of "20 Important Benefits of Music In Our Schools." From increased test scores, better work ethic and success beyond school, this list covers it all. When making the case for music education in your school, try focusing on just a few of the important benefits. If you feel you aren't making progress, you still have plenty of proven benefits to share. Be sure to find specific, personal examples of the benefits in action. Whether talking to a parent in your PTA or to an elected official, this is a great list to have in your back pocket.
First Lady Michelle Obama voiced her support for music and arts education last week at a Grammy Museum luncheon in Los Angeles. “For so many young people, arts education is the only reason they get up out of bed in the morning," said the First Lady. The luncheon honored musician Janelle Monae and Placentia school teacher Sunshine Cavalluzzi. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti was also in attendance and spoke of how music has helped him, even while in office. A piano player as a kid, Garcetti recently moved his piano into his City Hall office so he can rejuvenate himself. “We all know what music does for our souls, and to our hearts, and to our minds," said Garcetti. You can view the full text of Michelle Obama's keynote speech here.

More than 150 music education leaders visited Washington D.C. last month as part of the National Association for Music Education's (NAfME) Hill Day 2014. Leaders and educators met with elected representatives to advocate for support of school music. Additionally, NAfME presented their "Stand 4 Music" Award to the Grammy-winning band Fun.'s Andrew Dost and hosted a panel discussion on art's role in STEM Education with the Congressional STEAM Caucus. The panel discussion featured NAfME President Glenn Nirman, Young Audiences Executive Director David Dik and Memphis City Schools Chair of Arts Education Dru Davidson. You can view the full panel discussion on the importance of the arts below.
My parents would be the first to tell you that they are not musical people. After all, it was me who had to beg my parents to start me on piano lessons in third grade. They were great sports in listening to my early piano practicing, then saxophone and French horn. But they also have taken a keen interest in music. For example, my dad, who grew up in rural Ohio without much access to classical music, now really enjoys the big, symphonic orchestral works like the Mahler Symphonies. Author of The Music Parents' Survival Guide Amy Nathan recently described the many benefits of being a music parent. While we mainly think of the benefits to the child learning music, the parents also expand their horizons, try something new and connect to their children. So if you're a music student, go ahead and say "You're Welcome!" to your parents – but be sure to thank them as well for supporting your passion.
We've featured several El Sistema-related programs in "Fanfare," which displays the extracurricular and community support music instruction is receiving across the country. When schools are unable to provide quality music education, organizations like Upbeat NYC provide musical opportunities for students. This in-depth article from the New York Times describes the impact Upbeat NYC has had on many families: “They also develop teamwork, discipline, perseverance, empathy and problem solving — critical life skills for finding success in any career they choose to follow,” said Mike Fitelson, executive director of the United Palace of Cultural Arts. “But who knows — perhaps there is a Mozart-like virtuoso, or a Bernstein-like maestro, hiding in their midst.”
While this blog primarily focuses on the state of music education in the United States, I can't help buy feel for our friends across the pond in the U.K. In wake of austerity measures and budget cuts, the arts have taken a serious hit throughout the country. Programs like the BBC's Ten Pieces are attempting to keep the U.K.'s long tradition of musical excellence alive, but many advocates want more to ensure students have access to music education. This Guardian article explains the struggles in the U.K. and points to some possibility for progress.
Earlier this year, the Grammy Foundation posted several videos featuring prominent music artists describing how music impacted them. From Ariana Grande to Tierny Sutton, many artists participated in school music as a child and today are advocating for its importance. The Grammy Foundation produced the videos to promote their Grammy Music Educator Award, currently in the Quarterfinal stages. These short video snippets can also be used as resources for your own community. Whether recruiting young students to participate in music making or to display to the public music's importance. These videos can be a great resource for any music advocate. Below is a video from "The X-Factor" Third Season Champions, Alex and Sierra.

The application/audition packet for Music for All’s new Chamber Music National Festival, part of the Music for All National Festival, presented by Yamaha, is now available for download at.
The 2015 festival will be March 12-14th in Indianapolis, Indiana.
Music for All is proud to be again expanding the MFA National Festival to provide performance opportunities for students in chamber ensembles. The Chamber Festival is made possible by the commitment and generous lead donor support of Vandoren.
The non-competitive Chamber Music National Festival will offer wind and string chamber ensemble players the opportunity to perform on a national stage and experience professional coaching and instrument-specific master classes.
Michael Skinner, President of DANSR, Inc. (Vandoren) says, “Having students perform in a smaller chamber music size group improves listening skills and the ability to balance and blend. The independence you develop by playing in groups of this size simply makes you a stronger musician. When you consider that some of the greatest works we have were written for chamber groups, then pedagogically it’s clear that adding a chamber music component to Music for All makes sense both educationally and artistically. We are excited to be part of it!”
“Yamaha is very excited to join Music for All and DANSR in the forming of Music for All’s Chamber Music Festival,” says John Wittmann, Director of Artist Relations, Yamaha Corporation of America. “This effort will serve such an important group of students who otherwise might never have gotten an opportunity to grow from this crucial and underserved genre of music. We at Yamaha are honored to be a part of this initiative!”
Ensembles from four to 16 member can apply/audition. The final deadline for chamber ensembles to apply is September 15, 2014. See the application packet for details on this memorable experience and audition requirements.
We hope to see you in Indianapolis in 2015 at the inaugural Chamber Music National Festival!

Brother and sister Lloyd and Francesca Cleverly from Lidlington decided to start Jake’s Day Presents in 2013 as a testament and celebration of their brother’s life.
Jake sadly lost his life at Addenbrooke’s Hospital after suffering from an incredibly rare and devastating blood disorder.
After seeing the level of care that Jake received from the team at Addenbrooke’s the duo decided to gather a team of close friends and start a day to not only remember their brother, but to raise as much money as possible for the hospital
Lloyd said: “Jake’s Day Presents is Bedfordshire’s newest music festival. The idea behind the name is very simple. Raise money for a great cause, in the name of a great young man, promoting great local talent and business.”
Last September The Green Man in Lidlington was turned from a quite country pub, into an ear shattering utopia for fans of many musical genres as 14 bands and performers from Beds, Herts, Bucks and Cambs came together to lend their support.
Many local companies came together to offer their help. This included donations, the supply of necessary equipment, food and raffle prizes.
By the end of the day over £2,500 had been raised - and this has now been presented to Addenbrooke’s Hospital.
This year Jake’s Day Presents is hosting a full weekend of music in conjunction with the Red Lion Summer party at The Red Lion in Wilstead, Bedfordshire. This will be on July 5 and will comprise of over 20 live bands, acts and performers.
Fun filled entertainment for the whole family including barbecues, a bouncy castle, cake and beauty stalls, face painters, a hog roast and much more.

Why attend an audio described dance performance?
Some patrons come to hear the ballet music but have always wanted to know what's happening onstage. Others like the audio description to "fill in" what they might be seeing. While still others just listen to the pre-performance and intermission notes that go deep into describing production elements, such as costumes and scenery, and discuss key things to watch for during the performance.
VocalEyes Ltd, a UK charity devoted to audio description and accessibility of all arts and cultural genres, has wonderful resources about audio description for dance. Listen to patrons' experience at Matthew Bourne's Sleeping Beauty and their experience at Northern Ballet's Beauty and the Beast. Download a case study research paper called "Talking of Dance" by Bridget Crowley. Lastly, download an explanation of "Why go to a Dance Workshop?". Although PBT does not currently offer dance workshops, we would welcome patrons' requests for a program of this nature! Many thanks to VocalEyes for permission to link to their resources!

If you haven’t read the book and don’t know the story, Hazel is a cancer patient – and miraculously, the book isn’t as depressing as it might seem because of it.
Her hair will go to Children with Hair Loss, a charity that provides wigs for kids who have conditions that have caused them to lose their hair. No one asked Shailene to do this – it wasn’t a requirement for the role or anything – but it’s inspired plenty of other fans to join in the cause and also donate their own hair to those less fortunate. Pretty awesome.
Here’s a bit of what Shailene wrote about her decision on her tumblr page (click through to read the whole thing, as it’s long and worth a browse):”)
And here’s a little of what John Green himself added to the convo:!
I’ve had my hair cut short before but I could never donate as it’s chemically treated, and I believe that’s a stipulation for most places. Either way, this is a really cool thing to do and really took her up a few notches in my book (because, you know, that’s totally what she’s doing it for).Congratulation Teddy and Amleset!!!

Mobile game developer Zynga announced today that the newest iteration of its infamous word game, [Words With Friends 2], has officially been released globally. It offers multiple fun new ways to challenge your friends and yourself without straying too far from the format that made Words with Friends a staple.
Bernard Kim, President of Publishing at Zynga, touched on the company’s dedication to pleasing its millions-strong fanbase in a statement: … Words With Friends 2 gives players more opportunities to master their favorite word game than ever before.
If you’ve never played Words With Friends, it’s basically exactly like Scrabble — you and your competitor take turns positioning letter tiles on a virtual game board, spelling words in a crossword fashion. Each letter tile is worth a certain number of points, and there are also spaces on the board that can increase a word’s point value. The classic version of Words With Friends offered only two play modes — a normal mode, where you played against an opponent, and a Solo Play mode, where you played against the game’s AI in order to hone your skills. Words With Friends 2 has upgraded that experience with the following additions:
- Solo Challenge mode: Essentially a new and improved version of Solo Play, Solo Challenge allows users to practice playing the game by pitting them against AI-powered WordMaster bots. In this mode, players will advance through a series of increasingly difficult matches, challenging them to push their strategic skills in order to improve.
- Lightning Round mode: In the Lightning Round mode — the first Words With Friends mode to allow users to play against more than one person at a time — players will join teams of five to compete in intense, rapid-fire matches where speed is key.
- Updated boosts: Boosts have been a thing in Zynga’s games (like Word Streak with Friends) for some time, but like Solo Challenge mode, they’re getting an upgrade in the new flagship title. Boosts are a bit like hints, and give players advantages that help them both increase their scores and improve their strategic skills for future games. For instance, with the boost “Word Radar,” players can preview all possible placements for a certain letter tile.
- Social Dictionary: Zynga has added more than 50,000 new words to Words With Friends 2’s in-game dictionary, and have also enhanced it with in-depth stats that let players see how they match up against others re: amount of new words played.
In addition to all of those new functions, Words With Friends 2 also received a visual update, and is more minimalist and clean than its predecessor while still maintaining the important parts of the gaming interface users love.
If you’d like to upgrade to Words With Friends 2 from the original but fear that your current games and stats won’t carry over, Zynga assures that all your data including your friends, your winning streak, and more will remain intact when you make the switch. If you’ve never played Words With Friends before, this shiny new release is a great place to start.

Before we start in on the rave here’s a small rant for you. It’s only available if you purchase the Stila Makeup Player. Sigh. The good news is the player is $70 bucks and you get a ton of goodies with it but the bad news is if you only want the foundation it’s kinda a pain to buy everything…..mmm…see my dilemma? I’m hoping that come Spring, Stila will release the foundation on it’s own because it’s seriously a great product.
So what is it?
It’s basically a whipped foundation, indeed the texture is whipped, which offers sheer to medium coverage while acting as a primer and also a tinted moisturizer as it hydrates skin. I don’t have large pores so it’s bloody difficult for me to say whether or not it’s actually working in regards to acting as a primer to conceal larger pores. I will say that it feels incredible on my skin and offers a beautiful finish. It blends very easily and feels much like moisturizer would. Any dullness I have is erased as it evens out skin tone and creates a good working canvas for makeup.
It’s available in four shade selections ranging from fair to dark so basically it’s a universal fit for skin tones. In this I feel like it’s more of a tinted moisturizer than a full on foundation however it’s much more pigmented.
I found the product oxidizes a little slower than the average US brand foundation and wears quite long this is the case with many Stila foundations I’ve tried in the past which is a plus.
Overall, the flawless canvas it creates makes it a winner for me however I do wish the bottle was a bit larger as I feel like I’ll go through it pretty fast. I also would like to have the option to buy it without the player as what happens when I run out? Buy a new player? I think not.
Sportin’ Stila One Step Makeup Foundation, be gentle I’m not wearing any concealer!
I’d suggest it for folks who have certain dullness, uneven skin tone, or redness however anyone who feels they need heavier coverage for acne, acne scarring, etc….might not find it useful.
I can easily see it becoming an HG (holy grail) product for me.
Loves it!

Oh puh-lease Musey. Those dark circles are not that bad at all! You look lovely as usual.
And I’m super interested in this foundation, but I think I’ll wait and see if it gets released on its own.
aw shucks thanks mollie! 😀 but the fine lines are def SHOWING lol! *hugs*
I agree I’d wait too. I am a little ranty it’s sold with the player only.
Damn you! I was holding back from purchasing this because this is not known as The Season in Which Holly Spends All of Her Present Cash & the Winter’s Heating Money to Purchase Herself Cosmetics. I was waiting. I forwarded the email from stila regarding this to the Hubs. He vetoed on the grounds that I didn’t need another makeup case. I kept telling myself, nah, the foundation can’t really be that good, it’s can’t be all that it claims. And now you have to make me want it more than I want carbs. UGH. I will probably splurge and buy myself this today, or soon now.
hey holly LOL! 😀 awwww I’m sorries! I don’t mean to make you crave it more than carbs 😀 I REALLY like it but I am ranty as hell it’s only available with the player. What happens when I run out? buy another player!??!?!?!??!?! If I were you I’d wait a little while…January isn’t far off so Stila probably will give us some word on Spring 2010…maybe this will be released sold seperately so you can save some $$$!
I sure hope so b/c I’m in a deep trouble if it isn’t…I can just picture myself buyin makeup case after makeup case b/c I love the foundation so much!
Check out my Korres post too, I’m wearing the foundation in that post.
Seriously, I agree that it’s kind of a stinky thing that it’s only available with the player – I have no urge to get the player. So… here’s another vote for waiting until after the holidays to see if they put this out on its own.
I hope jen! fingers and toes crossed!
It sounds really good, but yeah..the “buy it with the player” part isn’t very appealing. It probably poses a big problem for a lot of people too. If it’s really as good as you say (which it probably is ^__^), I’m probably going wait and see if they’ll release it separately. By the way, do you think it’ll be okay for combination/oily skin?
ya mandy 😛 but it seems you can buy the player once and just get refills so that’s coolness for me 😀 Mmmm should be. I’m a combo at the moment oily forehead and dry cheeks and so far so good
I’m not sure if I like this foundation or not. If I’m having a good face day, it’s great. But if I’m having a bad face day it looks terrible. Today it was cakey looking on my chin. But yesterday it looked great.
interesting Comrade. So far, so good for me. No cakeyiness thankfully!
In the past few months I have had a born-again love for Stila. Years and years ago I loved it more than Mac then…….. I don’t remember why I strayed. I got the foundation sampler some time ago and that led to the hydrating primer being a staple and border line hg (if it weren’t for the elmers glue scent). I like the clicky lippy stains that don’t really stain too. So now I REALLY want to try this foundation. I am gonna be good tho – at least until next pay day
hey melissa same happened for me 😀 I strayed because the stila girls bowed out and they were revamping the packaging 😛 I miss the girls! Ooo those lip stains are good!? I was worried they’d be overkill on my lips good to hear they are nice 😀
That looks really great on you – which shade of the four are you wearing? I think that one might work for me, too (when I can buy it without the player!) TIA!
hi jennifer. I’m using it in light, thanks!!!!!!
I’m not sure if it’ll be released without the player, I sure hope it will be, we’ll see!
I’ve been looking for a review of this product….I had a feeling you’d let us know. I can always count on the Muse! I agree with Mollie and Holly. It looks great! Your skin is flawless! My husband has me on an impossible budget as well. I may have to wait for an individual release. But, I WILL buy this
Thanks!
my pleasure Valerie and thank you
I hope it comes sold separately as I adore it and will sob if I have to buy a player to get it haha!
Currently when you place an order for the player, when you put the player in your cart, you have the option of signing up for a continuing order plan- for $30 (plus tax and shipping) every 60 days , Stila sends you a new bottle of primer, an eye shadow trio, and lip gloss once each time (which seems to be a pretty good deal) which can be cancelled at anytime. At this time this seems to be the only way of re-purchasing the foundation, without buying the player. Thanks for posting the review!
omg! awesome Christina! Thanks for the heads up babe! That’s great news and very very inexpensive!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Cheers mate!
I just received my player and goodies today…love, love, love!!! I actually put the player on my wishlist thinking it would be perfect to listen to my ipod while getting dolled up. I signed up for the replenish program because there is no place in town to buy Stila and it’s a great deal at $30. The player is great, huge mirror, nice construction, good sound quality, and of course, 4 great products and a makeup brush.
fantastic Victoria! I was so happy to hear about the $30 replenishment deal! Def need to get myself the player
apparently at some point you’ll be able to buy it separately from Sephora:
although it’s ‘temp out of stock’ right now
yup I know rebecca
I blogged in a week or two ago
thanks!
One Step Makeup foundation is finally sold on its own and it’s in stock!
YAY
sonny yes we know! Thank GAWD! best product EVERS!
Oh you look great! Flawless skin 😀 What shade are you using? This product was released recently on its own, at 30ml bottles, I’m having a hard time choosing the right shade for me..I’m choosing between fair and light. I have NC20 – NC25 skin tone, what shade would you suggest? Thanks a bunch!! 😀
hi shir. at the time of the release there was only three shades (during the Stila player launch) so it was the lightest. I don’t really suggest shades as I haven’t a clue about what would look best on skin tones and types other than my own
I’m not a makeup artist so I really don’t have experience selecting shades for someone I can’t even see in person
I find it best to head in store and swatch a little to try them out and see what works best.
I hope this helps!
i got a sample of this with my sephora order and loved it, so with my next order, i added the sample to my basket again (i know im bad lol). now, i’m loving the coverage of this, i’m going to give in and splurge on the full sized bottle. amazing stuff
what shade is this? it looks so yellow , i love it ! xCanada Goose

Lauderducks
In Fort Lauderdale, you used to have either your bus tour or your boat tour. Now you can go amphibian on this city's ass. It's called Lauderducks, and it opened at BeachPlace this past December. The silly name comes from a very serious vehicle, called a DUKW. These babies are basically large trucks with watertight hulls that were built back in 1940 for use in World War II. A few smart people decided to buy some DUKWs from the government, renovate them, then charge the populace to ride and boat in them. The DUKW is a terribly awkward-looking thing, and that's one of the wonderful aspects of the tour: It's as much an oddity as anything you'll see while you're on it. People stare and wave as you ride by and make obnoxious noises with these little yellow quacker things the tour operators give you. The 80-minute ride -- which costs $21 per adult and $13 for children -- rolls up the shopping district of Las Olas, into Fort Lauderdale, where you learn about our wonderful history (like the fact that the Broward County Governmental Center used to be a department store). Then they drive you right into the New River, where you float by what the city calls Millionaire's Row, where half of the mansions seem to be owned by the Huizengas. Then it's on to the Intracoastal Waterway, where you gawk at more boats than you thought could fit on the ocean. In short, it's a ride into the heart of Fort Lauderdale -- and it's a hell of a tour. Quack, quack.

Each week, we'll make a list of our top ten something* and this week, it's the Top Ten Books Dealing With Tough Subjects. This is a tough one for me but I'll do my best.
*In no particular order
1. Saving June by Hannah Harrington
This book deals with the grief of losing a sibling to suicide. It's a very touchy subject and suicide isn't something that people generally like discussing, it's one of those uncomfortable topics, however it is extremely important and one that needs to addressed- especially with teens.
2. The Fault in Our Stars by John Green
As most of you will be familiar with, this book deals with the issue of cancer in young people. Putting aside the star-crossed love theme of the book, if you think about what it represents, it's a very deep and emotional story.
3. To Kill A Mockingbird by Harper Lee
This is an amazing book that deals with the issues of prejudice, injustice, racism, social-class, etc. A lot of serious issues are represented in this book.
4. Girls Saves Boy by Steph Bowe
Similar to The Fault in Our Stars, this book is about a boy living with a terminal disease who falls in love with the girl who saves him from drowning in a lake.
5. Speechless by Hannah Harrington
Another one by Hannah, this book deals with the issue of homosexuality and the different viewpoints people have of people who are gay in a high school environment.
6. The Perks of Being a Wallflower by Stephen Chbosky
This book is again set in a high school environment and deals with issues like popularity and fitting in, while subtly dealing with the issues of mental illness and sexual harassment.
7. Stolen by Lucy Christopher
This is an incredible book. It's centered around the abduction of a girl from an airport, and if I remember correctly, the issue of stalking.
8. Chinese Cinderella by Adeline Yen Mah
This book is the true story of the author's life when she was a young girl. She was the black sheep of the family, so to speak, and was forced to suffer through a lot of abuse.
9. Life on the Refrigerator Door by Alice Kuipers
This is a short story written in letters/notes left on a fridge door that depicts the daily life of a teenage girl and her mother who develops breast cancer.
10. Charlotte's Webb by E.B White
I know this is a children's book, but when you think about what the characters represent, it's really a story about someone who is forced to move away from home and doesn't fit in in his new environment and then the only friend he makes dies. It's deep, guys. It's a tough subject, the death of a friend.
That's all for this Tuesday, I hope you've enjoyed my list! Leave your comments below and links to your lists so I can check them out! Thank you! :-)
Never thought of Charlotte's Web like that... interesting. And I hope to read Perks soon- the movie was astounding!

My TTT
Haha! Perks is an amazing book! I hope you get the chance to read it soon. :)
Great List- To Kill A Mockingbird is a great choice!
Here is my TTT-
Kerri
Thank you! It's a great book. :)
Nice list! I've read about half of these and all of them ARE tough books to read. Important, though, because of what they teach us. That's why I like issue books, even though they're so hard to digest sometimes.
I agree completely. You've read half of them? You have good taste in books. :)
I've always wanted to read The Fault in Our Stars and The Perks of Being a Wallflower, most definitely will be keeping them in mind when I need something emotional or touching :)
Alicia @ Summer Next Top Story
Great idea, they're both amazing books. I hope you get around to reading them soon. :)Image copyright:

SHIPPING NEWS 2002
NORWAY's Future Extending?
December 25: Cruise Business Review published an interesting article on Star Cruises parent company of Norwegian Cruise Line. Among others the author interviewed Star Executive VP of Marine Operations & Newbuilding, Nils G. Nordh. Apparently, Star has prepared a study on the viability of extending the life of the SS NORWAY (ex FRANCE 1960) beyond the post-2010 SOLAS limit. Nordh was reported as saying that he believed it is not only technically possible, but was viable from commercial standpoint.
Right of Whale
December 25: The International Maritime Organization has approved a Canadian proposal to avoid an area favoured by endangered North Atlantic right whales, by amend shipping routes in the Bay of Fundy between Nova Scotia and New Brunswick off the Gulf of Maine. Thought to number only 350 worldwide, the most endangered large whales, are often injured or killed in collisions with large vessels in the bay, where dozens of the whales gather each summer. The new shipping lanes will force large cruise ships, tankers and other vessels to divert several kilometers around a designated zone to try to reduce collisions. The initiative will take effect on July 1, 2003. Current shipping lanes cut across the whales' summering grounds near New Brunswick's Grand Manan Island. 36 per cent of all right whale deaths between 1970 and 1991 were reported to be due to collisions with ships. Since then, the figure has risen to over 50 per cent.
WIND SONG seized
December 24: Tahitian officials claim having spent US$3 million rescuing passengers from the WIND SONG after a serious fire while sailing in French Polynesia, and have seized the vessel while they wrangle with Carnival executives. The luxury sail-cruise ship is now reportedly under French Polynesian government control in Papeete harbour. Windstar announced that vessel is beyond repair and proposes to tow her in to deep water, sink her.
CORAL PRINCESS To Depart France
December 23: Reports in the French press suggest that a second departure date has now been given for new CORAL PRINCESS to leave Saint-Nazaire, her delay due to alleged "computer communication issues" kept the ship from sailing December 23, at 1PM. The 964-foot ship is now expected to sail on Christmas Eve at 2PM for Ft. Lauderdale, Florida for her January 3 maiden voyage.
UPDATE: CORAL PRINCESS departed Saint-Nazaire, France at 2:30PM local time for Ft. Lauderdale, Florida she is expected to arive January 1st.
SPIRIT OF TASMANIA Sails North
December 23: The former Bass Strait passenger ship, SPIRIT OF TASMANIA has finally been bought by Norwegian shipping company Fjord Lines for US$34.3 million and sailed from Garden Island in Sydney Harbour yesterday after being laid up there since early September. The 31,400-tonne ship will undergo modifications before operating on a run between Hanstolm in Denmark and Bergen in Norway.
CORAL PRINCESS Finally Delivered
December 21: It was reported that after urgent and hectic last minute discussions, the CORAL PRINCESS was delivered to P&O Princess Cruises and will soon sail from the Saint-Nazaire shipyard, weather permitting. Allegedly, upon completion of an unprecedented seventh sea trial, she was handed over by Chantiers d'Atlantique. A further drydocking may be necessary to improve a problem with "rudder torque".
TAHITIAN PRINCESS Christened
December 21: Princess' TAHITIAN PRINCESS (ex R4) was christened today in Papeete by Madame Tonita Flosse, wife of the President of the Government of French Polynesia, Mr. Gaston Flosse. In an elaborate dockside ceremony, the ship was given her new name while a quay was festooned with tropical flowers and palm fronds. 300 government ministers, local dignitaries and special guests attended the event along with Princess Chairman Lord Sterling of Plaistow as the First Lady swung the champagne bottle against the hull of the ship. TAHITIAN PRINCESS' first sailing begins December 24.
Cause of DIAMOND PRINCESS Fire
December 19: The fire that severely damaged the almost completed DIAMOND PRINCESS (see October) in Nagasaki was caused by welding work below the passenger stateroom where the fire originated, it was announced today. The 113,000-ton cruise liner was under construction at the Nagasaki shipyard of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd when the fire broke out October 1. Welding work in the ceiling of the cabin below number 320 caused a steel plate about 5 millimeters thick to overheat and start the fire, a police investigation revealed. The damaged DIAMOND PRINCESS has since been renamed SAPPHIRE PRINCESS and is expected to be delivered in May 2004.
HANSEATIC Meets Rogue Wave
December 15: The 1991-built HANSEATIC berthed at Lyttelton, New Zealand at mid-day today after a voyage at reduced speed from the Chatham Islands.

ZUIDERDAM Inaugurated By Holland America
December 14: Holland America Line's new 82,000gt MV ZUIDERDAM was christened at Ft Lauderdale by noted television journalist Joan Lunden in a pierside bottle breaking ceremony that included dignitaries from parent Carnival Corporation, Holland America, and the ship's Fincantieri shipyard builders. Revealed to members of the press and travel industry early this month in a trio of three night inaugural cruises from Ft. Lauderdale, her first revenue-garnering voyage would depart later that afternoon following the festivities. The ZUIDERDAM introduces the first of five "Vista" class ships, touted as an "evolution" of the HAL product with more features in addition to the popular amenities found on the company's current fleet. The 1,848 passenger ZUIDERDAM is significantly larger than the last of the expanded STATENDAM class ships, the 63,000 gt ZAANDAM.
CORAL Cancelled
December 10: P&O Princess Cruises announced that it has been forced to cancel the maiden voyage of the CORAL PRINCESS for the second time in a month. Originally the first cruise, from Florida to the Panama Canal was slated for December 14 but was cancelled on November 14. Today, it was revealed that the revised maiden cruise scheduled to start on December 24, was also cancelled. In other maritime press it was reported that the ship suffered a complete engine blackout while undergoing sea trials. The blackout occurred off south Brittany and after drifting for some time CORAL PRINCESS had to drop anchor. Brest Maritime Prefecture sent two tugs to the scene to assist, and a helicopter was sent from L'orient to evaluate the situation. The crew managed to re-start the engine a few hours later and the vessel returned to the St. Nazaire shipyard. P&O Princess now hope to take delivery of the CORAL PRINCESS on December 20 and is confident she will be ready in early January next year. January 3 and January 9 have both been reported in the press as possible first voyage dates.
How Much For That SKY?

CONQUEST Buries The Lines
December 6: As reported below on November 22, the CARNIVAL CONQUEST was having difficulty passing under the high-voltage transmission power lines hanging over the Mississippi River. A long term solution was needed or the ship would reposition to Gulfport. Entergy Corporation announced that the lines will be buried 95 feet beneath the Mississippi River. Moving the lines will take about 18 months and cost nearly $15 million. Entergy will seek economic development grant money from the state to offset some of the costs and power customers will pay for the rest. Carnival Cruise Lines had threatened to move its newest ship to Gulfport, Mississippi unless the lines were moved. With a height of 208 feet, the CARNIVAL CONQUEST has been forced to hug the Mississippi River's bank where the lines rise to their highest point. Until the lines are buried, Entergy will turn off the lowest lines each time the ship passes under them to prevent the electrical current from jumping to the vessel. However, Carnival may still move the CONQUEST temporarily to Gulfport if her captain decides that there is any danger.
Bad Day For BLACK WATCH
December 5: Fred Olsen's 1971-built BLACK WATCH (ex ROYAL VIKING STAR, WESTWARD, STAR ODYSSEY) suffered mechanical trouble on her way to Southampton on December 3, delaying her arrival until today.

Enchantment Fades For AMBASSADOR
December 5: The reactivation of laid up 1958-built S.S. ENCHANTED ISLE (ex ARGENTINA, VEENDAM, BRAZIL, VEENDAM, MONARCH STAR, VEENDAM, BERMUDA STAR, ENCHANTED ISLE, COMMODORE HOTEL), as reported below on November 22, was premature. World Explorer Cruises pulled the announcement of the return of ENCHANTED ISLE as UNIVERSE AMBASSADOR from their website. The San Francisco-based cruise line is now not proceeding with its joint venture with Helsinki-based Silja Line, (owners of ENCHANTED ISLE), citing "uncertainties in the world travel market and lack of time needed to promote a cruise product for its upcoming sailings". It now appears that the ship will be sold to the highest bidder before the end of the year. World Explorer's current vessel, UNIVERSE EXPLORER (ex BRASIL, VOLENDAM, MONARCH SUN, VOLENDAM, ISLAND SUN, LIBERTE, CANADA STAR, QUEEN OF BERMUDA, ENCHANTED SEAS) will operate in Central America in December and January as scheduled.

WIND SONG, A Loss
December 3: Following a devastating fire (reported below, December 1) WIND SONG has been declared a total constructive loss. Parent company Carnival Corporation said that the ship, which caught fire about 10 miles off the coast of Tahaa, French Polynesia, had suffered "significant" damage.

FASCINATION Joins The List
December 2: Carnival's 1994-built 70,367 gt FASCINATION returned from a three-day voyage today with nearly 200 people sickened by a gastrointestinal virus with symptoms similar to those plaguing the cruise liners AMSTERDAM and DISNEY MAGIC. State epidemiologist, Dr. Steven Wiersma, reports that the illness is seasonal, peaking in the colder months, and is not uncommon. AMSTERDAM, which remained in Fort Lauderdale for 10 days to be disinfected, departed on a 10-day Caribbean cruise December 1 with 1,261 passengers.
WIND SONG Fire -updated
December 1: A fire broke out on board the 1987-built 5,703 gt WIND SONG in the South Pacific, forcing the evacuation of 127 passengers. The passengers and most of the crew, were taken to the nearby island of Raiatea on a passenger ferry, AREMITI, and then flown to Papeete, the capital of Tahiti. Seventeen of 92 crew members stayed behind on the WIND SONG to fight the blaze and were joined by French Navy ships, and fishing vessels who tackled the blaze for 12 hours. The ship was headed for Bora Bora when the fire started in the engine room from unknown causes. Windstar Cruises is currently working with the French Navy to arrange for the four-masted ship to be towed to Papeete, after which damages will be assessed and a determination made as to the expected time required for repairs. The 1986-built WIND STAR will be redeployed from its Central American itineraries in January to fill the void created by the WIND SONG's mishap. Windstar is a subsidiary of Holland America Cruise Lines, which is a subsidiary of Carnival Cruise Line.
CLIPPER ADVENTURER Runs Aground

The 4,673-ton cruise vessel ran aground in the vicinity of Deception Island (King George Island) and requested immediate assistance. Chilean icebreaker ALMIRANTE VIEL, which was immediately dispatched, reported that damage to the cruise ship was minor. No one was injured and pollution had not occurred. The Chilean tug LAUTARO was on stand by.
New Name For "Love Boat"
November 28: Pullmantur, a subsidiary of the Spanish tour operator Marsans, has announced it will buy the original "Love Boat" made famous by U.S. television. P&O Princess recently retired the 1971-built PACIFIC PRINCESS (former SEA VENTURE) from New York - Bermuda sailings. Following a 6m-euro refit, she will be based in the Caribbean and be marketed to Spaniards. The group will also create a new airline, Pullmantur Air, to fly vacationers to the ship, which will be renamed PACIFIC.
Disney Cancel MAGIC
November 26: After over one hundred people contracted a flu-like stomach illness this week on the DISNEY MAGIC, Disney canceled the next voyage. The MAGIC will remain docked at Port Canaveral while crews clean all the surfaces that people would come in contact with. A Center for Disease Control test confirmed the sick passengers had the Norwalk virus (probably passed from person-to-person), a common ailment that can cause diarrhea, stomach pain and vomiting for up to two days. Holland America Line similarly had to cancel a cruise with the AMSTERDAM remaining in port to break the cycle of contagion.
Transferring ex TRANSVAAL To Fremantle?
November 26: Just after reports circulated that the BIG RED BOAT III (former TRANSVAAL CASTLE, SA VAAL, FESTIVALE, ISLAND BREEZE) was being considered along with her other two former Premier fleetmates REMBRANDT (ex ROTTERDAM) and BIG RED BOAT II (ex EUGENIO C, EUGENIO COSTA, EDINBURGH CASTLE) for use as a floating shelter for homeless people in New York City, Perth-based Megawest Cruises announced its own plans for the handsome 1961-built liner. Formerly known as Swan Cruises, MegaWest lodged an offer with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission to raise $4.2 million (Australian) from private parties to develop a new cruise line offering a varied program of itineraries for the 100,00 strong Western Australian cruise sector. The intended plan will see the BRB III brought to Fremantle for a refurbishment before her first cruises are to begin in August of 2003. She would be leased for five years with an option to buy and staffed with Australian and Scandinavian officers and an international crew. Many thanks to Chris Gee for providing this news report.

QUEEN MARY, Home Of The Steam Ship Historical Society Of America
November 25: The RMS QUEEN MARY is the new West Coast headquarters of the Steamship Historical Society of America, Inc. (SSHSA). After a year of hosting the Society's meetings, the RMS QUEEN MARY Foundation began looking into providing a permanent office space for the society's research and outreach activities. On November 2, 2002, the society held its office's opening at their annual fall social. The office is located on B Deck, adjacent to the Caronia Room (former tourist class cinema) forward, on the port side. The office features a visitors' area with original QUEEN MARY furnishing (excepting the desk to allow for computer equipment) and a research room where visitors can study from the Society's archives and collections of books and paper memorabilia. The agreement between the Queen Mary and SSHSA calls for the office to be open on weekends with all SSHSA research services available on board being provided free of charge. But research is only a part of the program. When complete, the office will host the archive and research library, provide interpretive services for guests visiting the Queen Mary's B Deck Archives exhibit that showcases much of the classic furnishings, decor and service items used on the ship in her Cunard years. Educational programs include quarterly meetings with guest lecturers who conduct presentations on topics ranging from modern cruise ships to the ever-popular Titanic. Meetings are free for SSHSA members, RMS Queen Mary Foundation members and guests of the Queen Mary. For more information on the society's activities see the national website at For more information about the Queen Mary please visit the website at

CONQUEST In The Zone
November 22: The US Coast Guard is establishing a temporary safety zone for the lower Mississippi River beginning at mile 87.2 and ending at mile 91.2, above Head of Passes, extending the entire width of the river. This safety zone is needed to protect persons and vessels from the potential hazards associated with the weekly upbound and downbound transit of the cruise ship CARNIVAL CONQUEST beneath the Entergy Corporation power cable located at mile marker 89.2. Entry into this zone is prohibited unless specifically authorized by the captain of the Port of New Orleans or his designated representative. (see news item dated November 20, below).
DISNEY MAGIC Reports Ill Passengers
November 22: Press reports show that about 100 passengers on the DISNEY MAGIC contracted a contagious stomach virus. This news comes as the AMSTERDAM's most recent cruise is cancelled to break a cycle of contagion after passengers on four cruises became ill. DISNEY MAGIC is due back at Port Canaveral November 23. Disney announced that it will clean and disinfect the ship at sea and sick passengers will be offered compensation. There are no plans to cancel any cruises at this time.
OLVIA Released
November 21: The Ukrainian-registered cruise ship OLVIA (see item November 20) sailed from Auckland, New Zealand after the Maritime Safety Authority released it from brief detention imposed yesterday. The MSA deputy director said the vessel had been cleared to cross the Tasman Sea, but an audit of the ship's engineers was to be undertaken when the ship reaches Sydney, Australia. The aim of the audit would be to ensure the correct systems were in place. MSA staff found problems with an emergency pump and with equipment that separates oil from water in the ship's bilges. The notice of detention impossed on OLVIA was in relation to the marine environment rather than passenger safety. OLVIA sailed with 650 passengers from Auckland at 11pm, once the work was completed.
New York Officials Eye Laid Up Ships
November 21: New York City's commissioner of homeless services flew to Freeport, Bahamas to inspect several retired ships. To combat an increase in homelessness as winter approaches, the city is looking at the possibility of converting the ships into shelters. A record 37,100 homeless people were recorded sleeping in city shelters each night last month, with an increase in homeless families.). The DOPLHIN IV (ex ZION, AMELIA DE MELLO, ITHACA) is also laid up but soon to be towed for scrap. It is not known if the officials inspected TROPIC SEA, (ex PRINSES PAOLA, TROPICANA, SEA PALACE, ST. LUCIE).
OLVIA Detained
November 20: New Zealand press reports that the 1976-built OLVIA (ex LEONID BREZHNEV, KARELIYA) was detained with 650 passengers on board in Auckland overnight after arrival from Bora Bora.

OLVIA cannot sail until the problems are addressed.
NAVIGATOR OF THE SEAS and ZUIDERDAM Delivered
November 20: Royal Caribbean Cruises took delivery of NAVIGATOR OF THE SEAS from Kvaerner-Masa Yards in Turku, Finland, on November 18. Tennis star Stefi Graf will act as godmother of the ship in a December 6 naming ceremony in Miami, Florida.

TV star Joan Lunden will be the godmother in the December 14 ceremony at Fort Lauderdale, Florida.
CARNIVAL CONQUEST Out of New Orleans?
November 20: CARNIVAL CONQUEST sailed from the port of New Orleans on her maiden voyage November 15. However, there is a point down the Mississippi River where a power line dips to 176 feet at its lowest point above the water and since the ship is 208 feet at its highest point, it is forced to make a difficult manoeuver around the low hanging line. When the river rises this coming winter, the power line will prevent CARNIVAL CONQUEST from reaching New Orleans. Bob Dickinson, President of Carnival Cruise Lines, said "If we don't get that resolved, we may be in Gulfport, whether we want to be in Gulfport or not." Port of Gulfport officials had recent talks with Carnival about the availability of their docks. Estimates suggest that raising the power lines over the Mississippi River could run in to millions of dollars.
HAL Pulls AMSTERDAM
November 19: Holland America Line announced the cancellation of one sailing of AMSTERDAM. The November 21 sailing has been scrubbed in order to break the person-to-person cycle of a common gastrointestinal ailment called Norwalk Virus that has been occurring on the vessel for the last few cruises despite HAL's attempts at eradication. HAL said, "It is most likely that the virus came aboard ship in the form of an infected passenger, who in turn passed it to other passengers and crew members". Lieutenant Commander Jon Schoor (assistant deputy chief, vessel sanitation program, CDC) commented that "Holland America Line has been very pro-active in dealing with this unfortunate virus. Holland America has gone above and beyond the call of duty and we applaud their decision to pull the ship from service for one sailing." AMSTERDAM will return to service December 1.
COSTA CLASSICA Mid-Section In Rotterdam
November 17: Hans van der Ster reports that the COSTA CLASSICA mid-section arrived in Rotterdam onboard the semi-submersible barge GIANT 2 and was offloaded and moored for dismantling. HAPO purchased the section from the Cammel Laird yard and transported it to Holland for demolition. Mechanical parts from the engine will be used in a floating crane as thrusters, and other brand new auxiliary equipment such as pumps, air conditioning units, and a sewage plant, will find new uses. There are plans to convert the double bottom into a transport barge, itself. The section was loaded in September in Liverpool and after arrival in Rotterdam the GIANT 2 was submerged to a draft of 7.80 meters. About a month ago HAPO began demolition while the section remained on the pontoon GIANT 2.
NCL Talks To Lloyd Weft
November 17: It has been reported that Norwegian Cruise Line is in advanced discussions with German shipbuilder Lloyd Werft to complete the first of NCL's newly acquired Project America vessels. The partially completed hull of the first of what was to be a pair of US-built cruise ships, is on a forty day tow from the Ingalls shipyard in Pascagoula, Mississippi to Europe by ocean-going tug ABEILLE NORMANDY. NCL bought all materials to build the two Project America ships which were previously commissioned by now-defunct American Classic Voyages, but has not decided whether to complete the second Project America vessel.

Following the presentation was a book signing on board the QUEEN MARY in Long Beach. For more information please visit.
CORAL PRINCESS Delayed
November 15: P&0 Princess have announced that the French ship builders, Chantiers de l'Atlantique have delayed the delivery of CORAL PRINCESS. The ship's inaugural 10-day Panama Canal cruise has been postponed by one sailing to December 24. The reason given was "unexpected delays" at the yard. Panama's first woman president, Mireya Moscoso, will name the new ship in a ceremony in the Panama Canal's Gatun Locks on January 17.
Freak Waves In The Media
November 15: The British newspaper, THE OBSERVER carried an interesting story concerning freak waves. The report written by Robin McKie and Mark Townsend, called for a tightening of safety design as scientists admit to having no explanation for rogue waves. Often dismissed as legend or perhaps very rare events, research has revealed that "killer waves" do exist and regularly sink vessels all over the world. For no known reason, massive walls of water rise up and destroy dozens of ships and oil rigs each year. These giant waves cannot be predicted by standard meteorology, they are not tidal waves or tsunamis, nor are they caused by earthquakes or landslides. An example of a possible freak wave disaster was the LASH ship MUNCHEN which disappeared while sailing to the USon December 7, 1978. Despite a massive search, all that was found of the ship and her 26 member crew was a severely battered lifeboat. The official enquiry concluded that "something extraordinary" had destroyed the ship. (However, Hapag Lloyd was later informed that a Soviet boomer on partol off the US South Atlantic did hear the MUNCHEN break-up as it sank and provided its coordinates). Now scientists believe that these so called rare events are more common than previously thought. The liner QUEEN MARY was hit by a 75 ft wall of water while carrying 15,000 troops in December 1942, bringing her within moments of capsizing, it was later reported. In 2000, the cruise ship ORIANA was struck by a 70 ft wave that smashed windows and sent sea water cascading through the ship. In the same month, eight men were killed when a freak wave struck a trawler 87 miles west of Loop Head off Ireland. Previously, scientists generally asserted that waves at sea should not reach much more than 40ft. Walls of water up to 100ft are being observed, thus suggesting that something is wrong with current meteorology theory, although the origin of the freak waves still baffles scientists. British Minister of Parliament O'Hara has tabled a Commons motion expressing concern over ship safety in freak weather. The design of hatches and resistance of windows, he says, has to be considerably improved. A BBC2 documentary will air on the subject this week.
"Pulling" The PACIFIC Back Into Service
November 14: It was learned today that P&O/Princess Cruises' freshly retired 1971-built PACIFIC PRINCESS (ex SEA VENTURE) has been purchased from most recent owners, Liberty Maritime, by Spanish-based Pullmantur Cruises. The one time original "Love Boat's" new name and itineraries have yet to be announced.

AMSTERDAM Tummy Persists?
November 11: Press reports show that 181 people contracted a contagious stomach virus on Holland America Line's AMSTERDAM which returned from a Caribbean cruise today. No passengers or crew were hospitalized reported HAL. The virus was identified as a common "Norwalk-like" virus, which causes diarrhea and vomiting from 24 to 48 hours. Officials determined that it was contracted from person-to-person contact on the ship, and began with an infected person on a previous cruise which ended October 22, with a similar number infected. HAL reported about 600 workers spent more than 10 hours scrubbing down the ship before AMSTERDAM departed on a 10-day Caribbean cruise today. Passengers sailing on Monday's cruise were given a letter notifying them of the virus.

The ship's new owner, Paris Katsoufis, will not alter the classic ambiance of this much beloved vessel. During the VICTORIA's final cruise, however, P&O crew revealed plans to remove the 17th and 18th century china plates on display in the Coral Dining Room (artifacts that were originally part of the ship's Swedish American Line heritage). Other original items previously removed from the ship include the Four Burghs on display in the Princess Theater (which were from the 1953-built KUNGSHOLM). The MONA LISA will sail under charter to German-based Holiday Kreuzefahrten for the foreseeable future.

The partially completed hull began her 40-day journey Movember 5th.
In June about 350 workers at Northrop Grumman Ingalls shipbuilding resumed work on the 840-foot cruise ship to ready the vessel so that it could be floated from the shipyard. Work on the ship was halted over a year ago when the U.S. Maritime Administration ceased its guarantee in $1.1 billion in loans for the project after American Classic Voyages filed for bankruptcy. NCL reportedly paid between $150 million and $185 million for the partially built cruise ship and the materials for a second similar vessel.
LE JOOLA Death Toll Rises
November 6: A state panel of inquiry reported today that overcrowding and other violations of international safety standards caused Africa's deadliest ferry disaster, the September 26 capsizing of Senegal's State-run MS LE JOOLA. The government-appointed panel puts the death toll at 1153, higher than the previous official estimate of about 1000. The new number includes children and soldiers both of whom would have sailed without tickets. At least 1220 people appear to have been aboard the LE JOOLA. The ferry was built to carry approximately 600.
"Unknown" TITANIC Child Identified
November 6: Researchers announced in Halifax, Nova Scotia, that the remains of an unknown infant whose body was found in the Atlantic after the TITANIC went sank down in 1912 have been identified through DNA analysis. Historian Alan Ruffman, molecular anthropologist Ryan Parr and a team of scientists say the remains are those of Eino Panula, who was just over a year old when he, his mother and four brothers left Finland for the United States as third-class passengers. TITANIC historians have long believed that the unknown infant, buried in a Halifax graveyard for more than 90 years, was Gosta Paulson, a two-year-old Swedish boy traveling with his mother and older siblings. But samples from the grave did not match those of Paulson relatives. This unexpected discovery sparked a new and larger investigation in which the research team tracked down family members of four of the five other baby boys who died when the ship sank down but whose bodies were never identified.
SS UNITED STATES To Be Scrapped?
November 6: Rumors that the SS UNITED STATES may soon be scrapped have continued to be heard on the "rust-vine" for the last several months. Trade Winds magazine reports that the Cantor Company, owners of the BIG-U, have indicated it has no further interest in the vessel and she is for sale.

Southampton Announces Third Cruise Terminal
November 1: Southampton's Shipping Reporter, Keith Hamilton, writesin the Daily Echo that a new cruise terminal is to be built at Berth 101 in the western docks. This will give a spectacular view of the arriving liners from Mayflower Park. Associated British Ports, owners and operators of Southampton's docks say that the new terminal will provide much-needed extra capacity to Southampton which is already the UK's number one port for the growing British cruise industry. The £1.5m terminal will be built on the site of the former banana ship berths and will become a key feature on the city's waterfront. Next year, over 200 cruise ship calls are expected. Construction of the third cruise terminal is expected to be completed before the end of 2003. Associated British Ports has begun reconstruction work on the Mayflower Terminal at 105 Berth. This will extend the terminal to 106 Berth for the addition next May of P&O Cruises' OCEANA (ex OCEAN PRINCESS) and ADONIA (ex SEA PRINCESS) which will be operating alongside AURORA and ORIANA. In the eastern docks at 38/9 berth the Queen Elizabeth II terminal is to be refitted in preparation for the arrival of Cunard's massive 150,000-ton QUEEN MARY 2 which is expected to sail from Southampton on her maiden voyage in January, 2004.
NORWEGIAN DAWN Debut in Southampton

Cruise Ships To Baltimore, US Trend
October 30: Carnival became the latest cruise line sailing from Baltimore. The 960-foot CARNIVAL LEGEND, newest of the "Spirit" class vessels, sailed into port this morning to begin a six-day cruise from Baltimore to Bermuda. This cruise follows an industry-wide trend of bringing ships closer to major metropolitan areas. With many passengers reportedly turned off by air travel, cruise lines have dedicated more ships to ports in the mid-Atlantic and Northeast, saving passengers in those cities the flight to Florida for Caribbean cruises. For example, the Port of Baltimore will see about 40 cruise ship calls this year, as compared to only 13 in 2001. Miami-based Celebrity Cruises led the way, offering 29 cruises this season from Baltimore to ports in the Caribbean, New England and Canada. A further 25 sailings are planned for next year. Carnival has less ambitious plans for Baltimore, but next year plans to offer 50 sailings from New York. Sailing from New York, Philadelphia or Baltimore to the Caribbean has been made feasible by the faster ships like the CARNIVAL LEGEND, which can reach a speed of 22 knots.
SUPERSTAR LEO and SUPERSTAR ARIES To Shanghai
October 30: Star Cruises announced that two of its ships, the SUPERSTAR LEO and SUPERSTAR ARIES will be heading for Shanghai on 8-day/7-night cruises and are scheduled to arrive within an hour apart on the morning of 13th November, alongside the famous "Bund" for a two-night stopover. "The Shanghai call marks a milestone in the development of cruise tourism in China as it further demonstrates the vast potential of Shanghai as a major cruise destination", said Tan Sri KT Lim, chairman, president & chief executive officer of Star Cruises Ltd. For SUPERSTAR LEO this will be her second voyage to Shanghai and the first time that she will be alongside "The Bund". She will depart Shanghai on November 15 and will resume regular cruises from Hong Kong from November 17 onwards. SUPERSTAR ARIES' stopover in Shanghai is of historic significance as it is the first cruise ship in more than 50 years to embark passengers from Keelung, Taiwan with a final destination in Shanghai before returning to Keelung via Ishigaki. The arrival of the the two ships in Shanghai coincides with the China International Travel Mart in the new Shanghai Convention Centre. The two ships will provide the opportunity for media, international and domestic travel trade professionals and Shanghai residents a first-hand preview of these world-class cruise ships.
Economic/political Migrants Swarm Florida's Rickenbacker Causeway
October 29: About 200 Haitian migrants jumped off a grounded wooden freighter in shallow waters near Miami, FL and swarmed onto a busy bridge, which connects Miami with the upscale island community of Key Biscayne. Some of the crowd pleaded with passing motorists to help them avoid US Border Patrol Agents. The Coast Guard reported that the 50-foot freighter was dangerously crowded when it ran aground off Key Biscayne after a 500-mile journey. Live television showed passengers leaping from the bow of the vessel into the water one after another and swimming a short distance to the Rickenbacker Causeway. Border Patrol Agents were sent to intercept the Haitians, believed to be trying to migrate illegally. In similar cases, they are usually taken to an immigration detention center to await deportation hearings where most often they are deemed economic migrants and returned to their Caribbean homeland.
Shanghai Meeting on "Green Passport"
October 29: International shipowning organisations will meet Chinese, Japanese and Korean shipbuilders in Shanghai, China to discuss "Green Passports" for vessels. The world shipping industry is taking a step towards improving the safety and environmental credentials of ship demolition. Ships are recycled by the millions of tons each year on beaches in the Indian sub-continent. 32 hazardous materials including asbestos, lead, mercury and tin-based coatings found aboard. The International Labour Organisation reports workers with lung problems, gas explosions and beaches polluted with chemicals and toxic substances.
ELATION Deflation
October 28: Carnival Cruises canceled the scheduled October 27 sailing of ELATION due to a problem with the ship's propulsion systems. The trouble affecting the vessel's speed was discovered during the previous cruise. ELATION skipped a call at Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, and sailed for Los Angeles to complete its seven-day Mexican Riviera voyage October 27. She then headed to San Francisco for dry-docking. ELATION is expected to return to service on November 3 for a Mexican Riviera cruise.
Ferry Hits Warship
October 27: The Royal Navy's newest warship suffered major damage after it was hit by a ferry which was blown off course. The P&O ferry the PRIDE OF PORSTMOUTH was about to dock at its berth in Portsmouth harbour when 70 mph winds blew her into the side of the frigate HMS ST ALBANS. None of the 850 passengers and 130 crew on board the ferry were injured. A Royal Navy spokesman says the type 23 frigate, which was delivered last November and has not even entered service yet, was badly damaged. The collision caused damage to the port side including the superstructure, the 30 mm gun deck, the seaboat supports and the bridge wing. No injuries were reported among the 37 people on board HMS St Albans. HMS St ALBANS was to sail tomorrow for the final preparations before the warship undergoes its sea trials. PRIDE OF PORSTMOUTH appeared undamaged and is expected to go back into service later today.
Princess Bids Farewell To PACIFIC
October 27: After 27 years of service, Princess Cruises are retiring the PACIFIC PRINCESS (ex SEA VENTURE). After her final sailing from New York to Rome on October 27th, she will pass from the Princess fleet to new owners. In 1975, television producer Aaron Spelling approached Princess Cruises about filming a new TV show aboard their recently aquired ship 640-passenger PACIFIC PRINCESS. Although the ship was almost cruising fully booked, Princess felt that participating in the show would be an ideal way to increase awareness of the PACIFIC PRINCESS. The show ran for nine seasons as the "Love Boat" television series. Its star, the PACIFIC PRINCESS, was widely considered responsible for sparking the modern-day boom in cruises.
SUNDREAM To A&P Southampton
October 26: A&P Group has won a contract to carry out repairs to the 22,945grt SUNDREAM (ex SONG OF NORWAY) at its Southampton dry dock facility.

CARNIVAL CONQUEST Delivered
October 26: Carnival Cruise Lines today took delivery of their new 110,000-ton CARNIVAL CONQUEST, the largest in the fleet, at an 11am ceremony in the Fincantieri shipyard at the maritime terminal of Trieste, Italy (she sailed the aproximately 15 nautical miles from the Monfacone yard at noon of October 25th to the maritime terminal). The 3,710-passenger CARNIVAL CONQUEST is the first in a new class of ships for Carnival and becomes the 18th in the Carnival Cruise Lines fleet. She will sail from Italy on a 16-day transatlantic crossing in late October and is scheduled to arrive in her U.S. homeport of New Orleans the week of November 11. Her maiden voyage is a four-day cruise to Cozumel departing November 15. Beginning December 1, she will inaugurate her regular seven-day service from New Orleans. CARNIVAL CONQUEST features striking interiors inspired by the works of famous Impressionist and post-Impressionist painters in reference to her home port's French past. Following CONQUEST, Carnival currently have three other 110,000-ton vessels on order or under construction at Fincantieri: CARNIVAL GLORY, to be homeported in Port Canaveral, Fla., July 2003; CARNIVAL VALOR, 2004; and an unnamed vessel expected in the fall of 2005. Also on order is the 88,500-ton CARNIVAL MIRACLE set to debut in spring 2004.
Carnival gets the Princess
October 25: P&O Princess Cruises scuttled its proposed marriage with Royal Caribbean, instead backing a rival £3.5 Billion bid from Carnival Corporation. Carnival agreed to a key P&O demand to create a dual-listed company. This signals the end of a year long bid battle involving the three companies. Under a dual-listed merger, two companies agree to be run as one under a unified management, though no shares or cash swap hands. P&O and Carnival would retain their separate listings. Some UK institutions are limited on the number of foreign shares they can hold and P&O Princess feared there might be a stampede to sell Carnival's shares if it accepted its deal, which would reduce the value of its offer.
Star Test Historic Keelung-Shanghai cruise
October 22: Star Cruises has been given approval by the authorities on both sides of the straits for a one-off voyage. Next month, SUPERSTAR ARIES (ex EUROPA) will make the first direct voyage between Taiwan and China since the cross-strait rivals separated in 1949. The eight-day cruise, starting on November 10, which will also call at Okinawa, Japan, will carry passengers from Keelung in northern Taiwan to Shanghai. The historic cruise will be the first time passengers have been able to travel from Taiwan to the mainland without changing ships at a third port. Star Cruises hopes to launch direct cross-strait sailings immediately if the lengthy ban on direct transport links is lifted. Taiwan bans direct shipping between the island and the mainland. Beijing said it would refer to direct transport links with Taiwan as "cross-strait" - a neutral term that steers clear of the sovereignty dispute.
P & O's VICTORIA Bids Southampton Farewell
October 22: P & O's 1966-built classic cruise ship VICTORIA (ex KUNGSHOLM, SEA PRINCESS) sailed from the port of Southampton for the last time on Tuesday, October 22. Over the years, VICTORIA has built up a fiercely loyal group of admirers who are sad to see her go. At 5pm, the 28,800-ton vessel departed from 105 berth at the Mayflower Terminal in the Western Docks. She headed for the Mediterranean on a one way 11-day voyage ending in Civitavecchia (Rome). Fireworks, fireboat sprays and a storm of confetti delighted the over 700 passengers sailing on the sold out final voyage. Torrential rains abated and overcast clouds cleared revealing blue skies and a large rainbow for a few minutes as VICTORIA sounded her whistle in salute of the port which has long been her home. One passenger watched her departure from the quayside as he arrived too late to embark. 84-year-old, Hans Breitow had flown from Stockholm, Sweden, but arrived at Southampton Docks too late. He will fly on Gibraltar, her first port of call, to join the cruise. One man who did make the trip is MaritimeMatters writer Peter Knego, who flew from his home near Los Angeles for the farewell cruise. For Peter Knego's tour of VICTORIA on maritimematters, click here. Bon Voyage Peter!

AMSTERDAM Passengers Suffer Virus
October 22: A Norwalk-like virus struck Holland America Line's 1,380-passenger AMSTERDAM when some passengers contracted a gastro-intestinal illness on the October 1st repositioning cruise from Seattle to Ft. Lauderdale, due today. A HAL spokesperson estimated the number of passengers affected to be as high as 200. This is the same strain of virus that forced the line to cancel a cruise on the RYNDAM last summer when two cruises were affected.
Mitsubishi To Post Loss Over DIAMOND
October 22: Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd may post about 8 billion Yen in losses due to the fire earlier this month on the 113,000-ton cruise ship DIAMOND PRINCESS currently under construction for P&O Princess Cruises. P&O Princess and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries agreed October 10 that the construction of the DIAMOND PRINCESS will continue with a new delivery date to be announced, possibly February 2004. The blackened vessel was towed Monday at around 9 a.m about 5 km south of the site of the fire to a second Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. dock at MHI's Nagasaki shipyard. The 36-hour fire gutted 40 percent of the total floor space of the 14-deck liner. Police are investigating the fire and have yet to conclude if it was accidental or arson.
LE JOOLA Disaster Report
October 21: A report on the sinking of the ferry LE JOOLA was issued October 18 citing overcrowding, poor safety checks and bad weather as the causes of the disaster off the coast of Senegal on September 28. Almost 1,000 people died in the worst shipping disaster Africa has ever seen. The ship was built just 12 years ago by the German shipbuilder Neue Germersheimer Schiffswerft. She was approved for short sea journeys up to 50 nautical miles off the coast. Senegal had opted to undertake all maintenance and repair works since taking over the vessel. The state-owned LE JOOLA was sailing from Senegal's southern city of Ziguinchor to the capital Dakar, when it was caught by fierce gusts of wind and capsized. It is currently grounded on a sandbank off the Gambian coast. Senegalese President Abdoulaye Wade wants the ship towed back to Ziguinchor. LE JOOLA was designed to carry only 550 passengers but had nearly double that figure on board during her final voyage. Only 64 people survived the disaster. Lloyd's List commented that normally ships at sea are governed by IMO regulations, but because this was a domestic voyage between the two Senegalese cities, the ship was not governed by the international shipping rules.

STRAITS OF MACKINAC To be Sunk
October 20: Built in 1928, the 210-foot coal-fired steamboat STRAITS OF MACKINAC was the flagship of a fleet of state-owned ships that ferried people and cars across the waterway linking Lakes Michigan and Huron in Michigan. When the Mackinac Bridge was opened in 1957, the service ended. Former crew members and others bought the vessel from the state and began service to Mackinac Island. However, the STRAITS OF MACKINAC burned a ton of coal an hour and required a large crew. She made her last ferry crossing 1968. She then spent many years as a floating warehouse in Wisconsin and was eventually abandoned. A group of divers named the Mackinac Project plan to sink the ship 10 miles off Chicago's Navy Pier as an artificial reef and recreational site for scuba divers. After the ferry has been sunk in position, the club plans to cut holes in the decking, to give divers easy access. The project expects native fish will turn the wreck into a new habitat. No date for the sinking has been announced.

Hundreds Die in LE JOOLA Capsize
September 28: An ocean going 79.50 meter ferry capsized in a fierce Atlantic storm off West Africa and sank in three minutes, trapping hundreds of passengers. Rescuers said more than 760 people were believed lost. Only 32 people aboard the ship were known to have survived the disaster, some by clinging to the side of the overturned vessel. Senegal Prime Minister Mame Madior Boye said nearby local boats rescued them. The state-owned Schiffswerft Germersheim-built 1990 ferry LE JOOLA capsized off Gambia in the Atlantic Ocean about 11 p.m. enroute from the southern city of Ziguinchor in Casamance Province to Senegal's capital, Dakar. Dive teams so far recovered 88 bodies, and spotted a number of corpses through the ferry windows. Military divers with equipment to cut into the ferry arrived Friday night. Senegal declared three days of national mourning at midday Friday as the search for victims continued. President Abdoulaye Wade cut short a trip to France.
Ferries are the preferred means of transportation between north and south Senegal. The agricultural Casamance region is almost cut off from the rest of Senegal by a 20-year-long separatist rebellion by the Movement of Democratic Forces of Casamance (MFDC), making road travel unsafe. Merchants carrying dried fish, mangos and other goods from verdant Casamance make up many of the typical travelers aboard. Media reports said the ferry had undergone repairs, and had only recently returned to service after months in dock. Update October 1: Acording to a Lloyds report only 64 of the 1,034 souls aboard LE JOOLA have been found alive.

Concerned that a masterpiece of US engineering wil be lost, the Foundation urges you to immediately contact your Congressman, Senator and the White House from the following link and let them know that you will not stand to see one of the great American treasures lost".
"The Foundation's board of directors is considering starting an escrow fund for the purchase of the ship. The SS UNITED STATES' scrap value is reported to be only $2.5 million. You are urged to contact your local newspapers and tv/radio stations. The energy it will take from all of us to save this ship will be worth it when decades from now, school children look up at the magnificent structure of the SS UNITED STATES and marvel at such a techological wonder".

Maiden and Final Voyage From The Mersey
September 15: As reported on September 10, the $80mil cruise ship mid-section built to be lengthen the COSTA CLASSICA which was at the centre of the collapse of the Cammell Laird shipyard group took to the seas today for its maiden and final voyage to an undisclosed scrapyard in Europe. Receivers confirmed the sale of the COSTA CLASSICA structure earlier this month but refused to disclose the sum although it is reported to be far less than its construction costs. The 48 metre-long white elephant, towed by four tugs was understood to be heading for a European destination, possibly Italy, for scraping. The mid-section contains 15 decks and 350 cabins, a sun deck and shopping promenade. Cammell Laird shipyard won the contract amid intense international competition in a move that appreared to herald a new era of shipbuilding at the Birkenhead yard. However, Costa Crociere backed out of the deal in a wrangle over the standard of work and ordered the COSTA CLASSICA to turn around on half way through her journey to the yard off Portugal which effectively crippled Cammell Laird and led to its closure. The legal ramifications remain in the Italian courts and the process is expected to take years.

VAN GOGH's Gift
September 7: The Royal National Lifeboat Institution, (RNLI) which is funded entirely by voluntary donations and to provide a 24-hour service around the coast of the UK and Republic of Ireland, reported a surge in donations from VAN GOGH passengers. Passengers, crew and staff aboard VAN GOGH, operating on a summer charter by cruise company Travel Scope sailing out of Falmouth, Cornwall, have been donating around GBP400 on each cruise. One theory put forward by volunteer fund-raisers for the Falmouth RNLI branch is that spending days on the sea has focused the attention of passengers on marine safety issues. A total of GBP2,800 was handed over by the VAN GOGH's Captain Gregor Livov to Falmouth lifeboat coxswain Alan Barnes. In appreciation the Falmouth crew took Captain Livov and other cruise personnel on a spin around the harbour aboard their Severn-Class lifeboat RICHARD COX SCOTT.

PS PORTLAND Spotted, First Time In A Century
August 30: NOAA researchers showed the first video and sonar footage of the wreck of the Paddle Steamer PORTLAND, which sank in 1898 off the Massachusetts coast with all 192 aboard and remained lost until last month. After sonar pinpointed the size and shape of the ship in a location identified as a likely site for the missing liner, a submersible camera from the University of Connecticut's National Undersea Research Center was lowered and came across the hull of the ship in 460 feet of water between Cape Cod and Cape Ann. PS PORTLAND sailed from Boston for Portland, Maine, on November 26, 1898, just as two powerful storms were about to collide. Bodies and cargo washed up on Truro's beaches but four attempts to find the ship failed. John Rousmaniere, in his book "After the Storm: True Stories of Disaster and Recovery at Sea," said that so many African-Americans from Portland (30 to 40) were working on the steamer when it sank, that the shipwreck also helped destroy Portland's oldest African-American organization.

Norwegian Looks For STAR Exemption
August 14: Norwegian Cruise Lines, who operate the NORWEGIAN STAR, are looking for an exemption from the US federal law that complicates its current Hawaiian itinerary. The Passenger Services Act of 1886 prohibits any foreign-owned vessel from picking up passengers at one American port and dropping them at another. NCL currently operate outside the requirements of the Passenger Services Act by including a lengthy and fast dash to Fanning Island in the Republic of Kiribati in the NORWEGIAN STAR's itinerary to satisfy the requirement. It was reported that Norwegian Cruise Lines has been talking to Senator Daniel K. Inouye, who arranged a similar exemption for American Classic Voyages to run the foreign built former NIEUW AMSTERDAM as the US registered PATRIOT in Hawaiian waters. However, in that case, the ship was a stop gap until two new US-built cruise ships were brought online. In order to comply, NCL would have to operate their Hawaiian cruise business through a U.S. subsidiary, which would be totally subject to U.S. laws and have a U.S. crew. In September, NCL will bring in an additional ship, the 1,748-passenger NORWEGIAN WIND, to the Islands to run a similar itinerary with the NORWEGIAN STAR.

No name has yet been announced for the new ship, which is scheduled for delivery in late 2005, approximately 14 months after the delivery of the third "Conquest-class" vessel, CARNIVAL VALOR. At 952-feet in length the new 2,974-passenger vessel, is expected to cost aproximately US$450 million.
Rescue Icebreaker Becomes Trapped
July 26: The Argentine navy icebreaker involved in rescuing a German research vessel trapped in Antarctica has also become trapped. Argentine icebreaker ALMIRANTE IRIZAR had helped free the MAGDALENA OLDENDORFF as reported here on July 19. But both became trapped only days after the icebreaker started forcing its way through the Antarctic ice field with the German vessel following in convoy. The harsh weather and ice conditions stopped both ships, reported the Argentine Navy. MAGDALENA OLDENDORFF has only 17 crew remaining on board..
Plan to Save Cousteau's CALYPSO
July 26: A plan to berth the CALYPSO at New Rochelle, Long Island has been announced by the town's mayor and Francine, the wife of the late maritime explorer Jacques Cousteau. The CALYPSO, a 139ft former minesweeper, was given to Captain Cousteau by the Guinness family of Irish brewing fame. The ship became renowned through Cousteau's popular television shows broadcast in the 1960s and 1970s, but after sinking off Singapore in 1996 and then languishing for five years in La Rochelle, France, the CALYPSO is no longer seaworthy and now will require a barge to transport her to the United States. Four years since the conservationist pioneer's death, Jacques Cousteau's widow, Francine, has raised about the E4 million euros to move the vessel to La Rochelle's sister city, New Rochelle, in the US. The plan will see the ship restored and opened as a museum with memorabilia from Captain Cousteau's collection. Exhibits will include a hot air balloon and a mini-submarine with CALYPSO docked at the city's marina. Mrs Cousteau is currently in negotiations with the Guinness family.
EU Rule On Carnival Bid
July 24: European Union regulators have now unconditionally cleared Carnival Corporation's US$5.5 billion bid for P&O Princess Cruises PLC. Three months ago, it seemed that the commission was supporting Royal Caribbean's case when it cited serious concerns about competition in the luxury cruise markets, particularly in Britain and Germany. Royal Caribbean had been offering less for P&O, (US$3.7 billion) but had argued that the bid stood a better chance of winning regulatory approval. Both bids are undergoing antitrust review in the United States. Royal Caribbean had lobbied hard to get the EU to force Carnival to sell off its British subsidiary, Cunard Line, but no such condition was placed. Carnival, meanwhile, had said that it would not sell Cunard.
Second Ship To Be Discovered?
July 23: The Fort Lauderdale company, Discovery Cruise Line, that operates the well maintained 1,210-passenger DISCOVERY SUN between Port Everglades and Freeport, Grand Bahama, is actively looking to add another ship to the fleet. The second ship would sail an alternative new route.
Panama Canal Rate Hikes?
July 23: A proposed additional $20-per-passenger charge for of the Panama Canal toll could prompt cruise lines to consider deploying their ships away from the Panama Canal, according to press reports. A rate hike, if it is imposed, would take effect in October.
AUGUSTUS Exposed
July 22: The recently lauded UNITED STATES shares a 1952 birthdate with another magnificent (and thankfully intact) former transatlantic liner, the MV AUGUSTUS. Martin Cox and Peter Knego have scoured their archives and posted seven pages of photos and text detailing the history of Italia's MV AUGUSTUS and complete tours of the ship as she was originally built and as today's MS PHILIPPINES. Only REMBRANDT (ROTTERDAM), MARGARITA L (WINDSOR CASTLE), and perhaps AKDENIZ, are this original and well-preserved. From top of house to shaft alley, the tour (which is open 24 hours) starts at: MV AUGUSTUS / MS PHILIPPINES
Alstom May Sell Chantiers
July 20: In further fall out from the collapse of Renaissance cruises the energy giant Alstom is considering a restructuring move that could see it sell of its shipbuilding business. Alstom owns the French shipbuilding yard of Chantiers de l'Atlantique. Following Renaissance filing for Chapter 11 protection last September, Alstom experienced weak financial performance, its first loss on seven years. The loss-making shipyard Chantiers de l'Atlantique is currently building Cunard's QUEEN MARY 2.
Trapped MAGDALENA OLDENDORFF Freed
July 19: MAGDALENA OLDENDORFF, the German ship trapped by ice near Antarctica since June 11 was finally reached today by the Argentine icebreaker ALMIRANTE IRIZAR. The freed vessel will head for safer waters as weather allows. The MAGDALENA OLDENDORFF was bound for to Cape Town from the Novolazarevskaya research station in northeast Antarctica early last month when it came across a massive ice drift and was forced to seek shelter in a bay. In a difficult rescue mission complicated by freezing temperatures, high winds and thickening ice, eighty-nine Russian scientists and crew members were air lifted from the ship last week by military helicopters to the South African research ship AGULHAS and on to Cape Town. The owners of MAGDALENA OLDENDORFF, Reederei Egon Oldendorff said that both she and the icebreaker, could set off north through the channel cleared by the Argentine ship as early as Saturday. One Russian technician and 17 crew were still aboard the Luebeck-based ship.
Carnival's Bid in Doubt
July 15: Sources in the British press, close to the negotiations, report that the deal in which Carnival is bidding for P & O Princess may be blocked by the European Commission. Carnival has until July 18 to report shedding assets that would balance out the possible deal.

July 9: Carnival Cruise Line have announced that one of England's most renowned stage and screen actresses, Dame Judi Dench, will serve as godmother of their newest cruise ship CARNIVAL LEGEND. In Harwich on August 21, Dame Judi will break a bottle of champagne against the ship's hull in the official naming ceremony for the 88,500-ton, 2,124-passenger ship. CARNIVAL LEGEND is the first Carnival Cruise Lines vessel to sail a European itinerary.
Monsoons Make A Mess Of Alang
July 6: Work at Alang, the world's largest scrap yard, came to a halt as workers fled huge waves and torrential rains for two days last month (June 27 and 28). Workers wages and steel prices per ton have shot up as many locals have been forced to flee nearby towns. Currently, the only major passenger ship undergoing demolition on the Indian beach near Bhangvar is the LIBERTY (former COSTA RIVIERA, GUGLIEMO MARCONI). There are no updates on how the remains of the ship were affected by the storm.
BRILLIANCE OF THE SEAS Delivered
July 5: Royal Caribbean International took delivery of the new BRILLIANCE OF THE SEAS, the second Radiance-class ship, in a ceremony at Eemshaven, Netherlands. Built at Meyer Werft shipyard in Papenburg, Germany, BRILLIANCE successfully completed sea trials in the North Sea.

QM2 Keel Laid On Cunard Birthday
July 4: 162 years ago to the day the first Cunarder, BRITANNIA, sailed from Liverpool for North America inaugurating a transatlantic dynasty, the keel of the new giant QUEEN MARY 2 was laid in a special shipyard ceremony. In what officially signals the start of construction on the 150,000 gt liner, workers and invited guests watched the traditional laying of two coins within the keel. A new British five pound Jubilee coin and a one hundred Franc coin were placed inside a portion of keel number 502 as it was lowered into the drydock at the French yard of Chantiers de L'Atlantique, in St Nazaire.
Last Scientists Rescued
July 1: On Monday, two Oryx helicopters from the Antarctic supply ship SA AGULHAS airlifted the last remaining eight Russian scientists and 11 non-essential crew from the ice-bound MAGDALENA OLDENDORFF. The AGULHAS has now turned north and is heading away from the ice pack toward clear water. The owners of MAGDALENA OLDENDORFF will make a decision whether to keep the rescue ship in the vicinity until the icebreaker ALMIRANTE IRIZAR reaches the area on July 7. A Swedish icebreaker is also reported to be sailing to the area to render assistance.
ORIANA Of 1960 Makes Brief Cruise
June 30: SS ORIANA, looking freshly painted and dressed overall, arrived at the northern Chinese resort area of Dalian (also know as Dairen) for her newest incarnation as a static tourist attraction. She was towed from Shanghai where she has remained closed since early 2000. It is hoped that she will succeed in this, her fourth location, since being retired by P&O in 1986.
Antarctic Rescue Underway
June 29: The weather dependent rescue of the trapped MAGDALENA OLDENDORFF with 107 onboard offered better news today. Rescuers took advantage of moderate weather June 27 to evacuate 21 of the 78 Russian scientists trapped deep in the Antarctic. Two helicopters flew from the heated deck of the South African research ship AGULHAS when a break in the weather saw the wind drop to a moderate 12 knots. The AGULHAS continued to sail towards the trapped ship at about 12 knots, passing through 10 cm ice covering 90% of the surface. On Friday, June 28, 41 more scientists were airlifted off the ship in continuing flights but these were stopped due to an advancing cyclone. Total rescued so far are 69 people while 1 1/2 tons of food and supplies have been delivered to the ship. The airlifts will likely leave only the 38-member crew on board the MAGDALENA OLDENDORFF. In a news update, the AGULHAS has begun moving north (away from the trapped vessel and out of helicopter range) to avoid ice that has reached 35 cm thick and is thickening about 1 cm a day. The ice breaker ALMIRANTE IRIZAR is expected to arrive July 7 and should be able to open a path through to the MAGDALENA OLDENDORFF, allowing her to follow the breaker out.
Rolls-Royce Ships QM2 Stabilizer
June 29: Rolls-Royce completed the last of four Brown Brothers 40-foot long stabilizers bound for the new QUEEN MARY 2 this week. The stabilizers, each weighing 100 tons, will be loaded onto a flatbed truck and driven with police escort from Dunfermline in Scotland to Rosyth, where it will then be put aboard a ship and dispatched to Chantiers de l'Atlantique in St. Nazaire France where QM2 is under construction.
Two Burned Crew Rescued From QE2
June 27 2002: Two men were reported to be in serious but stable condition after they were burned in the engine room of QE2. The incident happened as the liner was sailing from New York to Southampton. The men were carrying out routine maintenance work when they were blasted with scalding steam from a faulty boiler valve. Both suffered severe burns and were placed in the ship's hospital. However, it was felt that greater medical attention was needed and a Royal Air Force helicopter flew out to rendezvous with the liner 250 miles south-west of Ireland to airlift the ratings to hospital.
Ice Thickens, Rescue Hopes Dimmed
June 26: 107 scientists and crew remain trapped on board the German MAGDALENA OLDENDORFF, as the ship carrying rescue helicoptors to the remote Antartic location is slowed unexpectedly by thick sea ice. AGULHAS left Cape Town for its 2,500-nautical mile journey to the Antarctic late on Sunday. The OLDENDORFF lies against a 13-story wall of ice in a bay off the Antarctic coast. Eating one meal a day to stretch their provisions another three weeks, those on on board expressed concern that the ship has only enough fuel for heat and lights for two months. Leaving port June 24, the powerful Argentine icebreaker, ALMIRANTE IRIZAR, is laden with supplies to last until October in case it becomes trapped. The ice-breaker has never sailed so far into the Antarctic ice fields this late in winter and is starting at a distance of 500 miles away from the MAGDALENA OLDENDORFF. For the captives of the winter ice, there is little to do and their supply of cigarettes ran out of about two weeks ago. The scientists are trying to stay busy analyzing their data and watching videos from the ship's library while all are listening for news of the rescue ships, and weather reports. The Russians were returning to Cape Town from a year stationed in Antarctica.
CELEBRATION Cancelled
June 25: Carnival Cruise Line's CELEBRATION had to cancel a four-day weekend cruise from Galveston, Texas due to technical problems with the propulsion system. The 1,486-passenger CELEBRATION was to sail on Thursday; spend Friday at sea; call at Cozumel on Saturday; and return to Galveston on Sunday. A Carnival spokesperson said the cruise line expects repairs to be completed in time for the ship to sail on her next scheduled cruise departing Monday. Passengers booked on the canceled cruise will receive a full refund and a 50 percent discount on a future Carnival cruise.
Project America Hull May Float
June 22: Northrop Grumman has assigned 350 workers to make the hull of the former Project America vessel under construction at the Pascagoula, Mississippi shipyard seaworthy. In the meantime, the US government looks for a buyer after spending $187 million to get the two ship project going. The second vessel was never assembled and lies in pieces around the yard. A proposal that the US Navy use the half-finished ship as a rest-and-relaxation ship for battle-weary troops was turned down and no further buyer has been indicated. For Project America's Congressional backers, Senator Lott among them, the ships were a way to jump-start the dormant commercial shipbuilding industry. The ships were being built for American Classic Voyages' Hawaiian cruise market and fell into the government's hands after the cruise company filed forbankruptcy protection last Autumn.
New Plan For ISLAND ESCAPE
June 21: Island Cruises, a joint venture between Royal Caribbean Cruises and First Choice Holidays of the UK, has altered the fall and winter itinerary of its one vessel, ISLAND ESCAPE (former VIKING SERENADE, STARDANCER, SCANDINAVIA). The ship is currently sailling out of Palma, Mallorca, on 7 and 14-night cruise vacations during the spring and summer seasons for European clientele. The ship's fall and winter itineraries that had included two trans-canal sailings and a series of 3 and 4-night Baja Mexico sailings round-trip from Los Angeles marketed to US passengers will now change to South American cruises for Brazilians. The new itineraries will be comprised of mainly of 3 and 4-night sailings to areas in Brazil such as Buzios, Ilhabela and Angra Dos Reis. Two transatlantic sailings that reposition the ship to and from Brazil will take cruisers to an array of ports from South America to Europe. After sailing in Brazil, ISLAND ESCAPE will return to the Mediterranean for the spring and summer of 2003.
P & 0 Takes Over Two Renaissance Ships
June 20: Peter Ratcliffe, P&O chief executive, and Gaston Flosse, the president of the government of French Polynesia, announced in Paris on June 17th, that P&O will offer cruises in Tahiti for five years starting in September. P&O will operate the two former Renaissance cruise ships, R3 and R4 (which have been laid up in the Papeete since September 26th 2001). P & O said one of the cruise ships will stay year round in the Tahitian waters while the other will cruise to French Polynesia about two months of the year.
Food Rationed on Trapped Antarctic Vessel
June 18: On board MAGDALENA OLDENDORFF, trapped in Antartctic ice since June 11, 79 Russian scientists and 28 crew have begun rationing their food as they wait for a South African rescue ship to arrive. The oceonographic research ship AGULHAS left Cape Town for its 2,500-nautical mile journey to the Antarctic late on Sunday but has slowed its pace after encoutering heavy weather. The rescue ship is expected to reach the edge of the ice within a week, but will have a further 500 mile journey through the icefields. An Argentine navy icebreaker, the ALMIRANTE IRIZAR, is set to join the rescue effort, but is not expected to leave Buenos Aires in time to rendezvous with the AGULHAS which will not wait for it before starting to make its way through the ice. The AGULHAS has a reinforced hull but cannot break through pack ice. The vessel will make its way through the cracks and passages in the newly formed ice at the edge of the field.
SUPERSTAR Tests Waters
June 16: Star Cruises, will be introducing for the first time for SUPERSTAR LEO a special 6-Day cruise from Hong Kong to Shanghai from 18th - 23rd August 2002. The SUPERSTAR LEO will make an overnight stay in Shanghai then revert back to her regular Hong Kong-South China Sea cruises to Halong Bay (Vietnam) and Xiamen (China) for the remaining of her present cruise season until September 2002.
REGINA MARIS To Be Sold
June 15: Due to the ongoing exodus of tourism from the politically troubled Middle East, Regina Maris Cruises will be selling off its historic 1929-built luxury cruise ship MV REGINA MARIS. The 280 passenger 4,007 gt vessel was built as the schooner-rigged private yacht ORION and was later renamed VIXEN before becoming a cruise ship under her original name, ORION, in 1950. In 1964, she was purchased by Epirotiki Lines and completely rebuilt into the ARGONAUT, which enjoyed considerable success under charter to Raymond-Whitcomb for many years. In 1996, she was sold to her present owners for cruises in the Red Sea. REGINA MARIS is presently laid up at Alexandria, Egypt.
Costa Mid-rift to be Scrapped
June 13: UK receivers Pricewaterhouse Coopers have been unable to find a buyer for the US$35 million mid-body section built by collapsed UK shipbuilder Cammell Laird for the COSTA CLASSICA. The section has been lying idle ever since the CLASSICA was turned back while en route to the yard for lengthening, will almost certainly be scrapped. Sale experts Babcock Disposals have been brought in to retrieve what they can from the contents. COSTA CLASSICA was scheduled to arrive at the Birkenhead yard on November 23, 2000 and was expected to be re-delivered to Costa on March 22, 2001. Costa blamed delays at the yard for terminating the contract. Latest reports suggest Italian court authorities are still adjudicating on who was responsible for breaking the contract.
BRILLIANCE Transferred
June 12: BRILLIANCE OF THE SEAS, the latest newbuilding from Royal Caribbean International, was transferred from Papenburg to Leerort on the River Ems and, on June 12, to Eemshaven for her final outfitting. During the the night of June 11, Meyerwerft's newest cruise ship was floated out after low water in the river had delayed the operation twice since June 8th. In the following weeks she will undergo sea trials, then debut in July with a summer of European sailings in the Baltic and Norwegian Fjords. In September, she moves to Boston for a fall season of Canada/New England sailings, then moves to Miami for 10 and 11-night Caribbean vacations through the end of the year.
Further Obscurity For Former RV SEA
June 13: Reports from SE Asia state that Star Cruises have returned NORWEGIAN STAR (I) (formerly ROYAL VIKING SEA/ROYAL ODYSSEY) to her owners, Actinor, who will charter the ship for three years to Crown Investments, a newly formed Chinese cruise line. As the CROWN, the once globe-trotting luxury cruise ship will be inaugurating a new cruise service between Shanghai and Cheju Island in Korea in late June for a mainland Chinese clientele.
QM2 Itineraries Announced

A keel-laying ceremony is expect July 4 for the 150,000-grt vessel, at at Alstom Chantiers de l' Atlantique in St. Nazaire, France.
More Aliaga Angst
June 8: Philippe Brebant and Hans Hoffman report two lovely old ferries have been delivered to Aliaga breakers. Under the delivery name OPY, the former QUEEN CALLIOPE/THESSALONIKI/KAMYROS/ROUSILLON/PRINZ HAMLET/PRINS HAMLET was beached at full speed on June 1, 2002. Built by Wartsila in 1966 for Lion Ferries, the 8,120 gt PRINS HAMLET was a near sister to Wallenius (later Commodore) Line's BOHEME, which is now sailing as the Scientology ship FREEWINDS. Two other similar ships survive to this day as Louis Cruise Line's PRINCESA MARISSA and the laid up Dane Sea Lines' ferry IALYSOS.
Joining the OPY on the Turkish beach is the handsome 1968-built 4,938 gt Italian Railways ferry GALLURA.
New Hope for US Hawaii Cruise Ship?
June 7: The D'Arcinoff Group, a Washington, D.C.-based investment firm, through its subsidiary Voyager Holdings Inc., is negotiating a deal to build three 1,000-foot cruise ships in Maryland, one of which is set for service in Hawaii. The plan to seek $1.6 billion in federal loan guarantees to build the ships is drawing scrutiny in aftermath of the bankruptcy of American Classic Voyages Co. Financing for the project hinges on support from Congress for the loan guarantee. Voyager is also seeking a waiver of federal law to allow the firm to run temporary service of a foreign-built vessel in Hawaii while the Maryland ship is built. Voyager's Hawaii ship would carry 2,000 passengers for three-day and four-day cruises.
OLYMPIA EXPLORER Christened

Star Expansion Plans
June 5: Star Cruises Ltd plans to buy a smaller new cruise ship to test the China market instead of earlier plans to buy two large vessels.

The ship, which was accompanied by the retired New York City fireboat JOHN J HARVEY on its arrival, is the second HAL ship to bear the name PRINSENDAM. The first PRINSENDAM (8,566 gt/375 passengers) was built in 1973 and enjoyed a brief career with Holland America before burning and sinking (with no casualties) in the Gulf of Alaska in 1981. Holland America has nicknamed the new 794-passenger 38,000 gt PRINSENDAM the "Elegant Explorer" and has refitted the 673 foot ship (formerly the SEABORN SUN/ROYAL VIKING SUN) to match the rest of the HAL fleet. PRINSENDAM will be engaged in worldwide itineraries.
In the pierside ceremony, HAL bestowed the honor of "godparents" of the ship to its 10,000 employees.

The following tips will help you manage bringing up a child effectively. These tips will help you keep one step ahead of your kids so you can be a successful parent.
Your children are always watching your behavior as a map for how they should behave. It is important to build and maintain trust with your children.
Spending time bonding with your children is important, but it is also vital that you take the time to focus on yourself as well. This will help you unwind so that you can become a more effective parent, and find out who you really are.
Transitioning between tasks can be challenging for preschool age children. Directing their attention from one thing to another can be irritating for them, and they may have a tantrum as a result.
If you have kids living in your home, you should never smoke inside the dwelling. In fact, why not quit smoking altogether? Exposure to secondhand smoke is almost as risky as the act of smoking itself. Children exposed to second-hand smoke are at risk of developing respiratory diseases like bronchitis, asthma and even pneumonia.
Each child is unique. Just because one raising a child style is effective with a child does not mean it will be as effective with another. Not only does this include rewards, but punishments as well. Remember which techniques work well, and which ones do not.
Always remember you have needs as well, and don’t forget to take good care of yourself when possible. Regardless of your schedule or agenda, take a break and relax for a few minutes when you can. When you’re happier, your children will also be happier.
It’s not easy to be a parent, but armed with this information you can be better prepared for it. Keep in mind the information you have learned from this article, and give your absolute best to your child. When you collect good advice and tips, you create a toolbox that you can always access to help make your job a little easier and your results more successful.BAFTA TV Awards 2013 - Inside Arrivals

Migraines affect more women than men. Nearly 75% of people afflicted are women. There seems to be some correlation between female hormones and migraines. Examples of such hormones are estrogen and progesterone. Throughout a woman’s cycle, levels of these hormones increase and decrease, and cause migraines in those who are migraine-prone.
About 5 – 10% of children suffer from migraines. In contrast to adults, boys and girls suffer equally, but are less likely to have migraines when they reach adulthood. Some girls experience migraines more frequently after puberty, but puberty is not the cause of migraines.
The majority of people suffering from migraines are between 15 and 55 years of age.
There are medical conditions that have a tendency to be present in people with migraines. These include depression, epilepsy, anxiety, high blood presser and stroke. They do not cause migraines nor do they increase the likelihood of a person developing a migraine. Yet, these problems may accompany migraines.

And the man behind Ape Mann Adventure Park, at South Barrule plantation, says that only a week after the opening of its high ropes course it’s already proving a big hit with residents and visitors alike.
Dave Kneale tackles the Ape Mann adventure park high ropes course at South Barrule plantation. Below, Jackie Turley and Adrian Darbyshire
Steve Salter invited a team from Isle of Man Newspapers’ newsroom to try out the course for themselves.
Unlike at Go Ape sites, the rope course has been built using a continuous lifeline system, which means there’s no need to clip on and off as you reach the different obstacles.
After being kitted up with a helmet and harness, and paying full attention to the safety talk, it was time to head to the tree tops.
At its highest point, the course is set eight metres above ground.
Ape Man high wire adventure park South Barrule Plantation Foxdale.
From the start, the course is a test of good balance, co-ordination, and looking where you are going without looking down.
The first obstacle involves negotiating a series of suspended wooden poles. This is followed by narrow wooden beams and a see-saw, before the first zipwire.
For many the highlight of the course was another zipwire which involves jumping off a wooden platform on to a giant rubber ball.
Crawling upwards through a tunnel slowed some members of our team down as did traversing a tyre net.
Ape Man high wire adventure park South Barrule Plantation Foxdale.
This is followed by more wooden bridges and beams, before it is time to take a deep breath for the last challenge – a leap on to the 300 foot zipwire that takes you back down to the ground.
It took only a hot drink to ready ourselves for the next challenge that is part of the package for everyone who tries the high ropes course.
At 17 metres up in a tree, the bell you ring to show you’ve climbed to the top is barely visible from the ground.
Attached by a belay system to Steve, we knew we were in safe hands, but nonetheless, it is a long way to the top!
The way down is easier than going up, abseiling back down the tree.
Work started on the high ropes course at the end of October, and was juggled around customers enjoying the low ropes course and tree climb/abseil.
Steve said: ‘It’s been a real team effort to achieve what we have.
‘Now what we are hoping for is a reasonably decent summer weather-wise.’
Steve and the team have even bigger plans in the pipeline for the site.
As well as extending the high ropes course, they are also looking into developing the quarry for an outdoor climbing area.
‘Hopefully if DEFA continue to support our plans, because of the lease we have got, we would be more than happy to further invest in the area and develop it to its full potential,’ he said.
‘A lot of that will depend on what support we get from government.’
The high ropes experience (£18 for adults, £14 for children) lasts two hours and is open to people aged 10 and over.
For those new to Ape Mann there’s the chance to go on the low ropes course first to get to grips with the equipment and kind of obstacles you’ll face, before completing two laps of the high ropes course.
Hot drinks and a tree climb/abseil are also included.

As Baby Boomers and their parents of the Greatest Generation pass away, they take with them arguably the greatest body of wisdom in human history.
The Living Legacy Project was created as a means to record and document these valuable life lessons, hidden in family pictures of senior citizens and their ancestors.
The Project was co-founded by Tom Cormier, a serial entrepreneur, and Dennis Stack, a former business manager with Payne Weber. "With today's technology and the need to find meaningful employment, it would be a tragedy to allow these valuable life lessons to go undocumented," Stack comments.
The success of the mission depends on a trained legion of independent professionals with good listening skills. "We are racing to train people how to become Certified Legacy Advisors to document this irreplaceable personal history before it is gone forever," says Cormier.
The skills required are inherent to an array of semi-retiring professionals who are finding a whole new way to apply their skills. After completing an online career course, they are presented with opportunities to build a legacy consulting business.
Deborah Perham spent three decades as owner of "Americourt Pride", a court-reporting agency in New York City and on Long Island. Today, she is using her court reporting skills to transition into a new career as a Certified Legacy Advisor and owner of "A Lifetime Legacy".
"It's a natural progression," says, Perham. "The storyteller is 'the witness.' The photographs are 'exhibits;' friends and family are 'expert witnesses.' She continues, "This project has given me great exposure for my new business."
."
At the conclusion of the online training course, Certified Legacy Advisors are licensed to use the Project's compelling videos designed to educate families and groups about the regrettable loss to future generations if immediate action isn't Stack. "With millions of baby boomers looking for purposeful work to support their retirement, there is no excuse to lose this personal heritage."
ABOUT THE LIVING LEGACY PROJECT
The Living Legacy Project is a global initiative of the International Association of StoryKeepers (I-ASK), a dues-based legacy career organization founded in 2008.
LegacyStories.Org is the official archive and sharing platform for the Living Legacy Project. The free website provides secure cloud-based content storage for personal oral histories, memoirs, journals, and talking photos. Members can link their stories to over 3.5 billion ancestor records in the world’s official family tree of humankind.

This year's heavy volume of automated political phone calls has infuriated countless voters and triggered sharp complaints from Democrats, who say the Republican Party has crossed the line in bombarding households with recorded attacks on candidates in tight House races nationwide........
(Excerpt) Read more at washingtonpost.com ...
Nobody has a right to complain about their house getting called unless they are on the "do not call list".
Anyone using a marketing machine has to first download that list by law before using the machine.
I help a doctor run one of these for his marketing, so I know of what I speak of here.
Yeah, OK. The GOP is now attacking defenseless old women with phone calls. WOMEN AND CHILDREN HARDEST HIT!
LOL...I've gotten two calls from Joe Piscapo saying even though he was a democrat,that he was voting for Kean the Republican.
Doogle
I AM ON THE DO NOT CALL LIST AND STILL GO OVER A DOZEN OF THESE CALLS LAST WEEKEND!!!!!! How the #$%(&%(&^)!@ do I get off theist (*&$%@! list!!!!
I may be mistaken, but I believe political parties are exempt from using the "do not call" list.
I am no expert here, but I do not believe the do-not-call lists pertain to political calling
Political organizations are exempt from the Do Not Call List.
I heard about this on the ride into work this morning. Tom Davis, Allen & Giuliani have all called me and Ive got about a metric ton of campaign flyers from the GOP, but not one piece of propaganda from the Dims. I just assumed that the GOP sent stuff to GOP folks, and the Dims sent stuff to the Dims. Are folks who aren't registered getting stuff from both parties?
By the way, the phone calls and flyers don't bother me nearly as much as what goes on at any metro station (in the DC Metro) on Election Day. Ive had gang initiation gauntlets that were easier to run.
If I understand it correctly, you actually have to verbally tell the caller to put you on THEIR do not call list when you receive a political call.
Someone correct me if I'm wrong ---- I believe political calls do not fall under the restrictions of the all-encompassing "do not call" list.
Political calls are not covered by the law.
That is one law that needs changing ASAP!!!!!!!
You can register your phone number for free, and it will remain on the national do-not-call list for five years. You may re-enter your number on the list when the five years have passed, and you may remove your number from the list at any time..
Wow, if that were the case, people would have a good case to be pissed.
You could be right 4Ps because I only know the business law on the issue, I assumed it was all the same.
What a horrible situation...
We got a call from the RNC asking us to vote for Richard Nixon.
I didn't know that, boy that really sucks.
Judging by the "unhappy customers" who I talked to while waiting in line to vote this morning, I think that candidates, parties and issues coalitions should re-think these calls next time around. IT IS REALLY TICKING PEOPLE OFF!
Thanks, that information is a pisser.
An Ohio woman, who did not leave her name, called The Washington Post in tears yesterday, saying she could not keep her phone line open to hospice workers caring for her terminally ill mother because of nonstop political robo-calls.She did not leave her name. What a shock.
I've had calls from the Republicans, but I've had twice as many from the Dems.
That is going to drive people nuts.
"Nobody has a right to complain about their house getting called unless they are on the "do not call list".
I'm on the state and Federal do no call lists and I've been inundated. I don't think they apply to political and charity calls.
I AM ON THE DO NOT CALL LIST AND STILL GO OVER A DOZEN OF THESE CALLS LAST WEEKEND!!!!!! How the #$%(&%(&^)!@ do I get off theist (*&$%@! list!!!!Dude. Your caps lock key got stuck. And then your keyboard turned all sideways. I have a suggestion: callerID.
However, listening to other people this morning, I was surprised by how much they hated the calls.
It does, and I believe it also exempts calls from non-profits so we still also get those fundraising calls.
I have been getting these calls consistently for the last week, from both sides but more from the R side- -GOTV effort I am sure. Last night was especially bad - I can empathasize with the woman in the article - seemed like we got a call every 5 minutes until after 9 p.m.
I also have a peeve with these calls - the speakers are often (but not always) almost monotone, and it also seems that the calls must be modified to eliminate the dead space between sentences to shorten the call duration. They make the already machine-generated calls sound even more machine-like. Personally, I question how effective they are.
On the other hand, I was able to tell a friend the other day that I had gotten calls from Newt, George Bush, and John McCain, all in the same day!
I had a call from Clint Eastwood last night urging me to vote for some right wing republican wacko in California. (I did this morning, of course.)
Three calls from Joe Piscopo and one from ex-governor Kean - sheeeeesh.....
I thought NC Rep Foxx drew up a bill (adding political campaigns to the do not call list) which was passed by Congress two yrs ago. At least that was a campaign promise. Wonder what happened? She's GOP too!
The lists do not block these two categories of calls.
It's the last day. We can deal with it because it's working to get our vote out. The small inconvenience is worth it IMO, and I've gotten at least 10 calls today myself. If it's a recording, I simply hang up, if a person, I thank them to their efforts and ask them not to waste time with me, it's no use preaching to the choir today, call somebody who might not be sure yet.
Tomorrow we can be glad it's over.
Take it back - just had one from President George W. Bush - hooray....
I'm a registered Republican in Ohio and I've gotten at least 4 times as much junk in the mail from Democrats than from Republicans.
I've received more mail encouraging me to vote for Sherrod Brown than I have credit card applications.
I have also recieved about 500 calls from a live person for the Gillebrand campaign. I generally try to keep them on the phone for as long as I can stand it and then finally tell them I'm voting for Sweeney! ;) (Which I did earlier today...and I will be praying the rest of the day that he defeats that inexperienced, liberal, toe-the Nancy Peloisi-line democrat running against him).
It apparently was happening in NH and Indiana, but it's been stopped.
Who else here is happy today is election day because the ads are over?
The last week, we didn't get any commercials except congressional attack ads from both sides, over and over and over again.
The ads have basically been running since labor day. I am not exaggerating that saying there was only 1, that is right, 1 policy issue, proposal brought up in the dozens of different ads run. They were all, you are sleazier than me.
The one policy proposal by the challenger btw was to give tax breaks to veterans. That was all the issues being discussed for 3 months. Makes me want to bury my head in the sand.
Here's the end of it. The last paragraph contains a particularly ridiculous argument. Oh, preceding the column were four letters from readers annoyed by the calls -- nobody submitted a letter in support of this practice.
"Robo-dials can be inconvenient, and I know there are times when mistakes are made and your phone rings at a strange time, but typically these calls take 30 seconds, and they represent the freedom of speech that our country was founded on.
<snip>
."
Uh no, the constitution does not guarantee you a right to 'market' to me on my private telephone line.
I agree...when caller ID says out of area or unknown I press talk than off so the darn thing quits ringing!!!!!
I am on the do not call list but they still come through....
Our governor has called me twice, as hve Rudy giuliani and Sarah Brady (about a local legislative race. She helped me figure out who NOT to vote for.)
I hvae all my numbers on that list and I still get them.
Political calls are exempted. Obviously, that needs to change.
Political calls are exempt from the "do not call" list.
Me too. The do-not-call list only works for some calls. Thanks to Caller ID, I only answer if I recognize the person who's calling.
If I don't know you, then if I'm in a really good mood I MIGHT let you leave a message on the answering service. Otherwise, you're SOL.

RELATED LINKSI GOT the new CD from Malojian about three weeks ago when Northern Ireland was subject to blizzardous conditions.
I put it on in the car and ‘The Deer’s Cry’ provided an excellent soundtrack for driving through the snow. It was both a guiding beacon and a calming influence.
To say the CD was ideal for snowy roads, is not to say it isn’t suitable for the vast majority of driving conditions.
Stevie Scullion, who for years worked alongside Jonny Toman as Cat Malojian, has produced one of the best albums you’re likely to get your hands on this year.
Since parting company with Stevie and dropping the Cat from the band’s name, Stevie has established himself as a genre-transcending poplord, but it’s good to see he hasn’t forgotten his folk rock roots which underpin the majority of compositions on this album.
Fans of Stevie’s former band will lap up songs like the ‘Watch The Rain’ and ‘Old Timer’ while his new direction is laid out for all to hear on tracks like ‘Checkmate’ where carefully crafted guitar chords give way to a dance beat that is the closest you’re likely to get to a dancefloor filler on a Malojian record.
‘Julie-Anne’ holds the key to unlock mainstream radio stations while ‘Often Wonder’ maintains an indie kudos.
There’s a touch of Lurgan humour too as Stevie blames Mario for ‘bringing all the computers’ thus ruining his world.
While many bands nowadays produce albums depending on two big singles to carry the rest of the disc, it’s refreshing to hear an album with six or seven songs that could be considered heavyweights, floating like butterflies, stinging like bees, but most importantly having the listener humming along like a hummingbird (or equivalent humming animal if you can think of a less obvious one).
Don’t wait until the next snowfall - get this album now.
‘The Deer’s Cry’ is available from

iHerb Customer Reviews
This is one one of the better brands of goldenseal. Because it's from the root instead other parts of the plant it's more effective and also doesn't give me headaches like the other parts of the plant can.
This time it was an ear infection. I have been using Goldenseal Root as an antibiotic for years. It always works. The trick is learning how much to take. Make sure you are always taking a good probiotic in between doses. Just like a pharmaceutical antibiotic, Goldenseal will kill the good and bad strains. You need to replenish the good ones with probiotics.

4W613 Work Day
August 28th, 2010
Around 10 AM Saturday August 28th, 2010 everyone met up at the Ahtanum Sno-park where the group was camped.
Sno-park bunny.
We headed up the Mid Fork across Darland and down to the Blue Lake trail where we stopped to fix the Darland Mt Sign.
Crawl Mama decided it needed some white paint.
We will have to come back and paint the brown part another day.
Next we took a break at Blue Lake.
We headed on up 4W615 and noticed someone had drove around the closed sign we put up at the bottom of a user made trail.
We drove up on top and saw the person ran over the closed sign near Blue Slide Lookout.
Some people do not respect the land or the volunteers that are trying to keep areas open.
We moved on down FS1020 and onto 4W613.
At Foundation Meadow we added some water bars since the trail was being wash away.
Woody packed the dirt with his YJ.
Just into the trees we added another small water bar.
And another trench to let the water run.
On down we made a drain where where a log dam was blocking the Spring/Summer run-off.
Once that work was finished we drove down to a bigger problem area.
Two stream crossings had to be rocked and the big mud hole blocked from use.
We lucked out with the rock being so close to this crossing.
Woody placed a big log into the mud hole with his YJ and with the help of others.
The next stream crossing wasn't as close to the rocks.
Down to fix the next mud hole. Volunteers worked to make the water flow.
Looks like it will work for now.
On down we had to cut a small log from the trail.
Near the bottom of Foundation Ridge we had to clean out another log dam.
We will have to bring more rock in at a later date.
Off to the bottom to turn around at the Lower Meadow.
Turning around at the Lower Meadow.
Heading back up I stopped to get get some pics of the tight area near the cattle guard.
Crawl Dad hooked his exocage on a tree and smashed the door.
We headed on back to the Sno-park.
This was a fun work day we a lot accomplished.
Thank you to all who came out to help.

Surveillance imaging of asymptomatic patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma who are in remission may have little benefit yet substantial costs, according to study results.
Patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who achieve remission from front-line immunochemotherapy most commonly relapse within the first 2 years, but rarely relapse beyond the 5-year mark, according to study background. Although routine surveillance imaging during first remission is common, some experts have questioned its value and have argued there is no curative benefit to repeat imaging, the researchers wrote.

It was nearly 6 years ago that I first heard of Rila Monastery.
It was mentioned in one of my favorite books, “The Historian
,” which.
The highlights of visiting Rila Monastery definitely are the courtyard and the church itself.
The outside of the church is covered in colorful frescoes, which were painted in the mid-1800s by a handful of Bulgarian artists, with the most famous being the Zograf brothers. These frescoes are unlike most I’ve seen — they are vibrant and cheery, and totally eye-catching.
These are contrasted by the serene, relaxed atmosphere that envelops the whole place.
Despite the miserable bus ride to get there, visiting Rila was one of the highlights of Bulgaria for me. I had been looking forward to it for so long, and it didn’t disappoint.. When I say “basic,” I mean squat toilets and no running water. Conversely, you can probably find accommodation in the nearby town of Rila.
Just like the rest of Bulgaria, Rila Monastery isn’t a place many people outside of Eastern Europe visit. But I promise it’s a site well worth the effort.

Would YOU want to visit Rila Monastery?
*Note: I visited Rila Monastery as part of a complimentary 18-day “Explore Eastern Europe” tour with Intrepid Travel. But all opinions, as always, are entirely my own.

I’m dying to go to Eastern Europe and The Historian is almost 100% responsible for that! For now, I’ll live vicariously through you and your awesome pics.

Beautiful beautiful artwork. Nicely photographed and described, Amanda!

Great photos. I’m a photo junkie, so that’s important to me. After seeing your photos I think it’s high time I changed my old digital camera to something more professional for blogging. What camera do you use?
Did you know that:
“Besides breaking the ‘political monopoly’ of Byzantium in Eastern Europe,
Bulgaria broke also the monopoly of Latin, Greek and Hebrew as the exclusive
‘holy languages’ of Christendom. Along with introducing Christianity as a
common religion shared with Byzantium and Rome, Knyaz Boris I the Baptist
ensured the approval by both the Pope and the Patriarch of Constantinople that
the Church language in Bulgaria would be the spoken language of the country.
In Western Europe the holy books became accessible to the common people
much later, with Martin Luther’s 1534 Bible in German, and the 1611 King
James Version of the Bible in English.”

This resulted in an SOS to my brother and my best mate who dropped their plans and headed straight to the venue. Little legends.

I love this gilet. it is very lightweight, but the down filling makes it very warm. it's not too bulky so can be layered under an outer coat in very bad weather. it's very on trend so i plan to wear it as a top layer over a fleece. thankfully it seems to be only available in black, otherwise i may have had to buy several!

It's not a natural key, it's a surrogate. There are a lot of codes that are use as if they were natural keys, and the American SSN is a perfect example. It is a surrogate key created and maintained by a third party. How much do you trust the organisation that creates the codes?

Original text of this messageHave you ever seen those “lullaby” cds for babies? Like every band these days seems to have one? I’ve given them out to friends who have kids and have sent everything from Van Halen to Metallica (knowing which band happens to be a parent fav.) SO now comes news of this! Five Finger Death Punch‘s heavy rock anthems are getting the lullaby treatment from Twinkle Twinkle Little Rock Star, the company specializing in making soothing little sleepytime songs out of rock classics. The Five Finger Death Punch collection includes instrumental versions of tunes like “The Bleeding,” “Battle Born,” “Under It And Over It,” “Lift Me Up” and the band’s cover of “Bad Company.” Twinkle Twinkle Little Rock Star has previously released lullaby versions of music from Metallica, Alice In Chains, Korn, Marilyn Manson, Slipknot, System of a Down, Iron Maiden, Pantera and many more. Check out the 5FDP one out here. So sweet!…. So, Pulse of Radio is also reporting Linkin Park singer Chester Bennington is not a fan of outdoor festivals. Speaking with NME, Bennington said that he prefers playing indoors, explaining, “Rock ‘n’.” But check the size of this crowd at Rock Am Ring in Germany last month. Hello!!!!! Meanwhile, excited to share this news from Of Mice & Men! They are direct support for Linkin Park on their European tour which begins Nov 3-23. They deserve it! I was encouraging Slipknot‘s mgt to put them on Knotfest back in May at Rock on the Range, and I dunno if my pushing helped, but I can’t wait to see them in front of thousands of maggots! I said this before and I will say it again: OF MICE & MEN are the real deal! See them now on Warped Tour before they get too big!

JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. – Missourians and others are being encouraged to venture beyond their homes and offices and head outdoors during “National Park and Recreation Month” in July.
Lauren Hoffman, director of marketing and communications at the National Recreation and Park Association, said her organization is challenging Americans to move an indoor activity, like a work meeting or family meal, outside each day in July.
She said no matter where one lives, there’s plenty to do outdoors.
“Park and Recreation Month is a great time to get outdoors,” Hoffman said. “Get inspired, and really get involved through your community parks and recreation. It’s all about getting outdoors and getting active.”
According to Hoffman, a recent study showed about 30 percent of Americans spend little time outside, and those who do limit it to about 30 minutes or less per day.
Hoffman said she hopes that promoting outdoor activity in July will help people develop a more active lifestyle year-round.
“There are various studies that are showing that parks and outdoor time can really help improve your mental health and reduce stress,” said Hoffman. “Parks and recreation really provide the opportunity to get out there and get physically active.”
Hoffman admitted a challenge to getting both young people and adults outdoors is that many are glued to smart phones and tablets.Originally published Apr 3, 2010. This is, of course, in addition to the transporting, coordinating, referring, and working with other rescues that we do to help other cats. We originally started with Siamese and long-haired breed cats (Maine Coons, Ragdolls, Persians) but quickly saw the need for dedicated rescue for Maine Coons and Ragdolls. We have worked with several breeders in the past couple of years to help them as they went out of business, decided to quit breeding, retired, etc.
Additionally, of course, we rescue from shelters around the state of Texas, including the areas of Houston, Dallas, Austin, and San Antonio. We have a very strict adoption process including an application with veterinary and personal references, a lengthy telephone interview, and a lengthy contract requiring no declaw, indoor only, and that our cats be returned to us in the event the situation does not work out (just to mention a few of our specific requirements).
Our cats stay with us as long as they need to find the right home, and we are committed to finding the perfect home for each cat. Our motto is: A home for every cat; a cat for every home. All of our cats are in monitored foster homes.
Though we love our Maine Coons, our rescue is quickly becoming pretty much Ragdoll Rescue as we find so many Ragdolls and Ragdoll mixes in the state and in surrounding states needing homes. See our current available Ragdoll Rescues.
I could tell you many stories of the lovely Ragdolls we have rescued and would love to share them with you. With the economic situation as it is, we have numerous cats coming in from sad situations. Since this is the case, at Jenny’s request, I’d like to quickly share the story of Killian and Jillian.
Killian is a lovely Mitted Seal Ragdoll mix; Jillian is her cute Brown Tabby Pixie-bob mix sister. The two of them found themselves in quite a situation when their owner went to jail and was there for two weeks before someone realized that her cats had been left in her apartment without care. For two weeks, these poor cats managed to get enough water out of the faucet to survive. When a friend finally came in to help, she discovered that the resourceful girls had pulled cereal boxes out of the cabinet to eat Cheerios in order to survive, but it didn’t stop these two girls from being wonderful babies. She notified me of their need for help one day; the very next day they were on transport to me. They came into our rescue and were quickly adopted by a lovely family in Killeen who wanted to keep the sisters together. Many of our cats come from similar situations.
Thank you for welcoming us to your website.

Hi,
My name is Carolina, and I had the pleasure to adopt my three cats, or better yet, kids, true loves of my life from MeLinda’s rescue, Merlin’s Hope.
The first one was Lucky. She came to me as a “shy” girl, but after some undivided attention and love, she rules the house, and my heart. I did not rescue her, she rescued me.
Then came Bugsy – this BIG fluffy, ball of love. Here is MeLinda’s specialty: She KNOWS her cats. She knows who gets along with who, which cat will do well in which environment. And that for me was absolutely essential when bringing each one home, as I wanted a peaceful and happy environment, and most of all, I wanted Lucky to thrive, and not to go back to be shy again. MeLinda did a wonderful job choosing Bugsy for me, he fit like a glove, and soon Lucky and him were best friends.
Then she asked my help to foster Hope… I should known that would not work out 🙂 I fell completely in love with my little one… Once again, MeLinda knew what she was doing – she knew Hope would fit the household well, and of course she did.
Today I have three wonderful kitties, that I wouldn’t change for anything in the world.
They are the sweetest, the most special, the fluffiest, the most loved… Merlin’s Hope didn’t give me cats, they gave me a family.
Thanks MeLinda!
Carolina, if you have photos of them and would like to include them on this page or another one for Merlin’s Hope – let me know! Thanks!
Carolina has been a true friend of the rescue. What she didn’t tell you is that Bugsy has had a lot of dental issues and this awesome lady has done everything that had to be done to take care of this wonderful boy. Yes, I may have “chosen” the right cats for Carolina, but honestly, any cat in Carolina’s home is the “lucky” one.

If anyone is qualified to weigh in on the state of MMA in Canada, it’s Patrick Cote.
The Quebecois fighter’s been one of the Great White North’s top exports in the sport for the past decade since making his UFC debut in 2004, and is currently finishing up his duties as the coach of a group of young Canadian fighters on The Ultimate Fighter: Nations.
Unfortunately, Cote says there are still too many barriers for young fighters looking to make a living in MMA.
“The only problem with MMA in Canada is the organization,” Cote said. “We have some talent, we have some great guys around the country, but they have a hard time finding fights or a spot to fight and just show what their skills are.
“That’s the problem. We have good, good guys around the country and they’re just waiting for the opportunity to fight somewhere.”
Cote’s not the first to lament how hard it can be for Canadian fighters to find opponents.
Without a national promoter, up-and-coming Canadians are left seeking out fights with local promotions. Once a fighter develops a reputation for being dangerous in the octagon, prospective opponents have little incentive to step in the ring with them — after all, why risk a win-loss record blemish?
Speaking in February before a fight against Toronto’s Sergej Juskevic on Calgary’s Hard Knocks 34 card, promising Lethbridge, Alta. fighter Brandt Dewsbery explained how both he and his opponent ended up sitting on the sidelines, waiting for a fight for over a year.
“People want wins and want to get to the UFC and we both have records where people aren’t confident about going in and fighting us and getting wins,” the 23-year-old Dewsbery said. “It’s fighting, you’re supposed to go out there and be a man about it and not take the easy way.”
After spending time with the next generation of Canadians looking to make their mark on the UFC as a TUF coach, Cote’s not sure the challenges are getting any easier to overcome.
“There are a couple smaller organizations, but it’s hard for those guys in Canada and in Quebec to find a good organization to prove that they deserve to have a spot in a bigger show in the U.S. or somewhere else,” Cote said. “It’s really hard for those guys who are trying to start to have a career in MMA and I hope it’s gonna be better.”
For now, Cote’s focus is firmly on April 16, when he’ll return to the UFC octagon after more than a year off to fight Kyle Noke in the TUF finale.
It’s a chance for Cote to re-establish himself as a contender in the welterweight division, and Cote travelled to Thailand to train with Tiger Muay Thai to prepare. The three-week camp, combined with a renewed focus on training and nutrition, has the 34-year-old confident he’s got lots of time left fighting in the octagon.
“I feel better than ever,” Cote said. “Right now, I’m fighting because I still love it, not because I need it. I’m not nervous at all to go out there and perform, I’m just going to enjoy the moment.
“I don’t do the sport to be No. 3, I do the sport to be the champion and that’s what’s pushing me everyday to the gym.”

@SUNDannyAustinRANCHO SANTA MARGARITA – The City Council will once again vote on the fate of the former Nissan dealership site.
The council on Wednesday must decide whether to approve a proposal to loosen restrictions on the 4.75-acre property or let voters decide in November.
Theory R Properties CEO Joe Daichendt, owner of the property, is seeking to convert the former dealership into a retail center. That requires rezoning the property, a proposal that the City Council rejected in January.
Daichendt decided to take the issue to voters by getting an initiative on the November ballot. He submitted more than 5,000 signatures to the city June 3.
City staff rejected the signed petitions the next day, claiming Daichendt didn’t publish a notice to circulate the petition in the correct newspaper, Coto de Caza News. But the court on July 1 ruled Daichendt met the requirement by publishing a notice in the Orange County Register and ordered the city to verify the signatures.
The city asked Orange County to verify the signatures. And on July 10, county Registrar of Voters Neal Kelley certified Daichendt collected more than 2,571 signatures, 10 percent of the number of registered voters in Rancho Santa Margarita.
According to the court’s ruling, the council must choose between rezoning the site and putting the initiative before voters at the Nov. 4 general election.
Wednesday’s City Council meeting starts 7 p.m. at City Hall, 22112 El Paseo. Anyone at the meeting can comment on the ballot initiative or other issues. More information can be obtained at the city’s website, cityofrsm.org, or by calling 949-635-1800..Hi Activate, I have an enquiry

Let us get startedAmes Spy Case: Don't Blame the Russians
Given the chance, the US would have paid handsomely to get similar undercover information on Moscow's doings
THE arrest of Aldrich Ames on charges of spying for Russia has set off complaints, including some from people who ought to know better, about Russian perfidy in post-cold-war euphoria and glasnost.
The complaints are misdirected. We have plenty of reason to be upset, but not at the Russians. The appropriate focus is on Mr. Ames and his wife, Maria del Rosario Casas Ames, who has been charged with him.
Let it be said up front that discussion of this case must respect the ancient principle that the Ameses are considered innocent until proven guilty, with the proof strong enough to convince a jury of their peers beyond a reasonable doubt. That is a degree of protection they would not have in many other countries and certainly not in Russia, even in post-communist Russia. We also should keep in mind that the Federal Bureau of Investigation saying something is so does not make it so; the FBI has been known to exaggerate. But if even a little of what the FBI says about the Ameses ultimately proves true, this is mind-boggling espionage.
The salient fact about the case is that it involves an American (Mr. Ames allegedly was the principal actor) spying against the United States. We do not yet know whether the Russians recruited Ames or whether he volunteered his services. It doesn't matter. Nobody forced him into whatever relationship he allegedly had with the Russians; the evidence points to greed as the motive (he supposedly got more than $2.5 million over eight or nine years). Even if he had been blackmailed, a CIA officer with Ames's experience certainly knew that the agency has effective ways to protect its employees from blackmail and is happy to do so. So whatever Ames did, he did freely.
And if the FBI is even close to correct, what he did was betray his country.
What did the Russians do? They paid Ames for the information he is charged with bringing them. It was valuable (they certainly paid enough for it) on two counts: It told them which Russians were untrustworthy, and it told them what else Americans were trying to do to them.
Given a chance, the CIA would certainly pay a Russian intelligence officer handsomely for the same information. It also would pay a similarly situated informant in almost any other country. Indeed, it has done so, though it may not have reaped the same rich harvest that the Russians apparently got.
Americans who get upset over Russian behavior with the Ameses are either naive or hypocritical. Sure, US-Russian relations are better than they used to be, and Russia is getting economic aid from the US. But Israel was getting aid from the US, too, and that did not stop the Israelis from paying Jonathan Jay Pollard to steal secret documents for them to copy.
If he really did what the FBI says he did, Ames is the real culprit, just as Mr. Pollard (who also was helped by his wife) was the real culprit in the 1986 Israeli spy case. Our anger and frustration can be more constructively directed toward how the CIA's and FBI's combined counterintelligence and security procedures did not detect the problem sooner.
Ames violated one of the first principles of successful espionage: He abruptly upgraded his lifestyle and spent money conspicuously. That should have set off alarm bells for any counterintelligence officer. And it should not have sufficed for him to suggest that his wife's family had money in Colombia. Surely the CIA station in Bogota could have checked that out.
And what about Mrs. Ames? While she was cultural attache in the Colombian embassy in Mexico City she allowed herself to be recruited as a paid CIA informant. Mr. Ames was in the CIA's Mexico City station at the same time.
Two years later, in 1985, the pair married in Washington while the CIA apparently looked the other way. The agency has been known to reject requests from officers to marry foreign nationals when it feared their families might be used as instruments of pressure. Here was a CIA bride who had already sold out one country being accepted into the bosom of the agency's family. True, she had sold out to the CIA, but all that says is that she was untrustworthy: If she would let the CIA pay her, she would let somebody else pay her.
During the cold war, many spies were unmasked on both sides. Rarely was much of a public fuss made. Life - and espionage - went on. For those who thought the end of the cold war would change things, disillusionment undoubtedly comes hard. But life - and espionage - will.Christopher Wallace

Cops Pursuing New Leads in Biggie Smalls Murder Case - Posted January 7, 2011

the military coup in Niger and international conflict
Question: Military Sources in Niger announed on Thursday, 18th February that soldiers led by Major Adam Haroun staged military coup against President Mohammed Tanja and declared that the the president and members of government have been detained at aplace in the vicinity of the presential palace in the capital Niami. The also annopunced the suspension of the constitution and dissolution of governmental establishments. Is this miliatary coup similar to others coups in the past in Niger which have been due to local conflicts between the influential French agents in this former French colony, or is it a reflection of international conconflict? May Allah reward you!
Answer: Yes, indeed this military coup has taken place as you have mentioned, and they have declared formation of a ’Higher Council of Restoration of Democracy’ under the chairmanship of Salo Jeebo, the commander of the Support Unit in Niami which includes heavy armours like battle tanks. The Council stated: “The government stands dissolved, and the ’Higher Council of Restoration of Democracy’ advises the people that general matterrs have been delegated to the directors general of various ministries and provinces. [Reuters/AFP: 19.02.2010].
To better understand the event, we present the following indicators:
1. The French news agency A.F.P annouinced that an unnamed French official had earlier informed it: “A military coup is immnent in Niger and that Tanja is not in a very good position.“ The A.F.P added that this French diplomat mentioned to it that: “The Presidential Guard participated in the coup.“ He explained: “ We are aware that a division of the armed forces opposed to Tanja and have imposed themselves in violation of the constitutional directives, but we believe that they are a handful minority.“ He said: “There has been a history of military coup in this country, but we did not believe that it would be staged with such speed.“ The Prime Minister of Niger Ali Bajo Ghamani had on Wednesday, i.e. a day prior to the coup called an important meeting of the cabinet of ministers.
2. This indicates that France was not expecting this miliatry coup against it agent Mohammed Tanja to take place this quickly although it was aware about the presence of such military soldiers but it presumed that they were an ineffective minority who are not in a position to stage a coup. France was undertaking negotiations with them in an attempt to resolve the situation in order to avoid a coup, but it did nevertheless take place. Also the Niger government was aware of the challenge to it and it, along with its supporter France wanted to solve the issues that thretened it.l But the soldiers surprised both the Niger government as well as France.
3. France had expressed its displeasure over the coup and it was executed despite this. The French Foreign Ministry spokesman said: “France condemns any unconstitutional takeover of authority and calls for dialogue between the rebels and the president.’’ [Free American Channel: 19.02.2010]. This statement of the French spokesman reiterates that France was opposed to the rebels and wants dialogue to restore the deposed president, which implies that the coup was staged against France.
4. The French news agency A.F.P on 19th February, 2010 quoted an unnamed American official in Washington saying: “ Indeed he [Tanja] has no one to blame for the coup but himself.’’ A.F.P and other news agencies also carried another report on the same day that the US State Department spokesman Phillip Crowley had stated: “This is difficult situation, President Tanja was trying to extend his term. And clearly this prompted today’s events.’’ He said: “We believe this emphasises that Niger should work to hold elections and form a new government.’’
5. The statements of the US official not named by the French news agency and the statements of the US State Department Spokesman indicate that the coup is acceptable to the US and it hold the deposed president Tanja responsible for it. This was implied in the refernece to Tanja attempt to extend his term by three years through a referendum held last August to effect changes in the constitution. The opposition forces had then opposed the move and the political situation in the country had become tense. Tanja had been elected twice after the coup carried out by troops led by Brigadier Dawood Malaam Wanki in 1999. the constitution of Niger does not allow a third term for a candidate and hence it was amended. He had dissolved the Constitutional Court because it did not ratify the the amendment which allowed him a third term or extend his term of office. Similarly, Tanja had dissolved the parliament on 26th May, last after which parliamentary elections were held November last which were won by the opposition.
America’s reference to the extension of term is it to lay responsibility on the president and thereby justify the military coup. Also the US State Department Spokesman did not call for either restoration of the deposed president nor for dialogue between the rebels and the deposed president. Instead he called for holding of fresh elections and forming a new government. All this indicates that hte US is behind the coup.
6. It is known that Niger is an Islamic country and a mahority of its people are Muslims. It was a French colony under its direct rule and was given nominal independence in the year 1960, but the French influence continued there in all spheres. Even today there are 1500 French to protect its nuclear interests, since Niger is third largest producer of Uranium in the world and it is the French companies that have invested in Uranium production. This is why the US is eyeing it with greed in order to exercise control over it and remove French influence there as well as in other African nations, most of which are Islamic and are rich in many natural resources that provide raw materials of various types as well as energy resources. This is why it has been the bone of contention for the greedy European and American colonialists.
7. Due to Niger’s importance as a Uranium producer, especially since it is financed by the French companies, it is unlikely that Americans will gain access there so easily and France is not likely to abandon its colony without resisting the US. Hence the next few days are going to witness a hot international conflict in this Muslim land which are different to what Niger has hitherto witnessed between various French agents.

Mesothelioma at International Paper Mill in Florida
Located in Panama City, FL, International Paper Mill is a potential source of asbestos exposure cancer.
Mesothelioma lawyers alledge it is one of approximately 123 asbestos exposure sites in Florida. Exposure to asbestos at International Paper Mill, even in small amounts, is a known cause of mesothelioma, asbestosis, cancer, and other lung diseases, even in smokers.
Asbestos companies such as International Paper Mill in Panama City and across the United States, recognized the dangers of asbestos but continued to manufacture it; asbestos was used in numerous buildings and workplaces, including International Paper Mill. As a result, there is a risk of asbestos exposure in Florida cities, such as Panama City. Over 61 cities in Florida have known asbestos exposure sites.
Florida residents should know that asbestos-related lung diseases, such as mesothelioma cancer and asbestosis, typically have a long latency period. This means that if you were exposed to asbestos at International Paper Mill in Panama City,, or anywhere in Panama City Florida,.Florida mesothelioma attorneys may be able to help victims of asbestos exposure with meshothelioma in and around Panama City recover financial compensation for medical expenses and lost wages.Staff report

Seurasaari, where a windmill is among the historical structures.
HELSINKI — The Finnish capital is an accessible and compact city known for its vibrant design tradition, food culture, and as a 21st-century high-tech innovation hub. A visitor to the city, with its tower-dominated technology district and center chockablock with boutiques, galleries, hotels, and restaurants that speak of the next new thing, might easily forget that Finland is one of the least populated countries in Europe. But Seurasaari, an island on the Helsinki’s western outskirts featuring a dense forest, lakes, and rocky beaches, offers a taste of the nature that typifies the rest of the country. The island is also home to the Seurasaari Open-Air Museum and what our friend, Washington, D.C.-based architect Travis Price, calls “a nexus of folklore, culture, and nature.”
Price is founder and director of Spirit of Place/Spirit of Design, a design-build educational exploration program at Catholic University of America that provides architecture students the opportunity to research, design, and construct a project in nine days in a remote landscape. In 2010 on Seurasaari, he and his students built Kalevalakehto, literally “cradle of the Kalevala,” named for and inspired by the Kalevala, Finland’s national epic compiled in the 19th century from Finnish oral folklore and mythology.
JANUS ANATTA
A pedestrian bridge leading from the mainland to Seurasaari.
Although Seurasaari Island is just a 15-minute bus ride from downtown, we’d spent our other Helsinki trips focused on design and food. But here for the first time in summer, and with Price’s project complete, we planned a long overdue day trip to the island and museum.
The bus we caught on Mannerheim Boulevard by the Esplanade, the tree-lined park in the city center, dropped us at a crowded parking lot at the edge of the mainland. Steps away, a long bridge led to the 113-acre forest of birches and pines floating in the Baltic Sea.
First developed as a public park in 1890, the island was originally accessible only by boat. The museum was founded in 1909 by Axel Heikel, a specialist on ethnology and vernacular architecture, with the intent of preserving the traditional rural life of peasants, craftspeople, and gentry from the 18th to the 20th centuries. It would eventually direct the transfer to Seurasaari in the next 60 years of over 85 cottages, farmsteads, manors, and other buildings from the provinces. Today Finland’s National Board of Antiquities maintains the Open-Air Museum and other architectural sites throughout the country that speak to Finland’s rural heritage.

The museum buildings are loosely concentrated on the left side of the island and tucked into the forest. After wandering beyond the entrance area, we chose a clockwise path for exploring, following along the rocky coastline with its small harbors, the sea at our left, the forest at our right, and dipping inland when we were drawn to a particular structure.
One of the most striking statements about rural Finnish life is the massive 19th-century church boat from the central lakes region that appears early in the tour. Owned jointly by farms in a village, these boats could carry as many as 100 people and were used to ferry worshipers in summer to the churches near the water. We walked on to 18th-century Niemalä Tenant Farm, the first structure to be relocated here. The rambling low buildings include storehouses, cattle sheds, a threshing house, sauna, and cooking shelter, their sheer number indicative of how prosperous this farm on the shore of Lake Keitele was.
It is said in Finland that every man is a builder. Traditionally the majority of the population lived in rural areas and built their own dwellings using mostly horizontal log construction and working with hand tools — usually, and sometimes only, an ax — and drawing influences from Sweden and Russia. “Talkoo” — voluntary work, often between neighbors — was a common way to construct labor-demanding structures such as churches or parsonages or the more ornamental birch bark shingle roofs.
Karuna Church is a masterwork of Finnish carpentry and the oldest building on Seurasaari. Built in 1685 in Sauvo for Baron Arvid Horn, it exemplifies this collaborative building technique and features a fine birch bark roof. Inside the white-washed barrel vault ceiling and simple lines of the rough-hewn log walls exemplify Finland’s legacy as the crossroads of Scandinavian and Slavic cultures, and how simplicity, addressing basic needs, and a connection with nature shaped the country’s sensibilities.
Other structures reflected a rural life sharply defined by the seasons. From Petsamo in the far north are tree storehouses built on a high tree stump to store meat in seasonal dwelling areas. Hay cabins from Lapland were built in distant fields to provide housing during haymaking. The water mill, like the example here from central Finland, was communally owned and in operation day and night during spring when the streams and small rivers were at full flood.
We came finally upon Kalevalakehto, on the south side of the island and at the very end of the architectural trail. Crafted from Finnish wood, stainless steel, and glass, the small building rested on a rocky finger jutting into the sea. Envisioned as what Price had described as “a meeting place to evoke the deepest thinking,” the interior was like entering the belly of a boat. In the embrace of its curved horizontal plank walls warmed by the sun and lapped by the sea, the air was as head-clearing as a sauna. We sat on simple benches and through walls of glass looked either to the primeval forest or to the sweep of the modern city across the bay. The experience of this building, rooted in Finland’s ancestral mythology and celebrating Helsinki’s identity as a world-class design city, formed the perfect endnote on a day of history conveyed through nature and architecture.Judith Turner-Yamamoto can be reached at editorial@pickworthbell.com.

Filed under: Government/Legal, Saab, Earnings/Financials.
There are currently $77 million in unsecured claims, according to Reuters, but that number doesn’t include claims from former Saab dealers. Naturally, the entire affair is full of lawyers and legalese. A trust formed on the Saab side will be negotiating with creditors and their affiliates in an attempt to reduce claims against Saab. This sounds like the start of a long and sordid affair…

What I've yet to see (and I apologize if I've missed it) is a diary that features a northeast Ohio comedian just eviscerating Josh Mandel through a fake "outtakes" video. The video and a bit of info below...
One of the reasons that I think this video is so awesome and powerful is that it uses humor to completely destroy Josh Mandel.
It mentions so many good things:
- Ridiculous pandering to Ohio coal minors by faking a southern accent? Check.
- The fact that Mandel gave sweet jobs to college buddies with no relevant experience? Check.
- The fact that Mandel barely adheres to any fixed position on any issue? Check.
- The fact that Mandel completely lies through his teeth? Check.
- The sleazy tactics Mandel used to defeat his last political opponent? Check.
- The fact that he's so career-driven that he's already plotting his next political move without paying much attention to the job at hand? (He was barely in his job as state treasurer before he started running for senate). Check.
- Mention of the fact that a bunch of Ohioans will vote for him simply because there's an R next to his name? Check.
Just take a look for yourself:
I think this is the kind of viral video that could really have an impact on independent voters and people that just don't trust Mandel. The facts are all there, but presented in a fun and entertaining way.
The comedian who made this video, Mike Polk, makes a lot of videos about Cleveland, particularly their sports teams. They're all pretty hilarious, and I recommend checking them out. He also happened to make another Ohio-related political video I've seen (although a bit older) and it's gold as well:

Conventional Xenon lamp-based sun simulators do not adequately cover the full spectral range from 365 - 1080nm, limiting the conditions a PV module will experience in the field. Long life time and low power consumption requirements have also restricted Xenon lamp-based systems ability to reduce CoO.
The ECOSUN 10L can extend the impulse duration to more than 7 seconds, a feature that excludes the phenomenon of capacitive effects. The unit is also usable on next generation high efficiency cells, low-loss junction boxes as MOSFET and modules with microinverters. A stable, repeatable and constant pulse allows to measure in a very repeatable and reliable way the power of a module with a repeatability error of less than 0.2 % on more than 100 measurements, according to the company. Another benefit of using LED’s is the long lifetime which can be expressed in 30 millions of tests compared to 50 thousand flashes of a Xenon lamp of sophisticated level.
Triple A class for testing of PV modules, including crystalline, thin film and back contact solar cell modules.
The simulator’s very compact footprint of 4,6 m² and its work height of 1000 mm makes it suitable for an inline production and for factories and laboratories with limited space. TϋV Intercert performed an in-depth control before characterizing the unit and releasing the certificate of triple class A.

Seriously… what other sport has a secret rule book and issues secret fines? (I’ve called this a “speach limit” elsewhere.)
Let’s look at another case of a driver making pretty strong comments to see how NASCAR might have handled the Keselowski incident. Tony Stewart has made a number of very pointed criticisms of Goodyear’s tires. In some cases (Indy), the criticism was right on target. After others (Atlanta 2008), it was perhaps not as much. Stew (Goodyear) got run out of Formula One, the IRL, CART and USAC, you name it.”
Goodyear’s response (in part):
.”
Even NASCAR’s response was measured. Mike Helton went on Stewart’s radio show and discussed the issue openly with Stewart. He said what many of us were already thinking:
“Tony, we’re all well aware of your opinion and your right to express your opinion, albeit, I think maybe a little bit too strong in this case.”
Goodyear invited Stewart to tour their tire-making factory and talk with the engineers who design the tires. After that visit, Stewart moderated his comments and admitted that Goodyear is making their best effort with a difficult problem – while still noting that they don’t always (in his opinion) get it right.
After the tire debacle at Indy, who did Goodyear invite to help test the re-designed tires? Tony Stewart. It’s one thing if the people who are always happy with you say good things. It really says something when your worst critic says you’re doing better.
I understand entirely NASCAR’s unwillingness to have the integrity of their officiating called into question. That’s the analogy of telling the umpire he’s blind or cussing out the tennis line judge. It’s poor sportsmanship. The sanctioning body has the right to defend the integrity of the sport. If they feel like a fine is the only way to do that, OK, but be upfront about it.
My problem with the Keselowski situation is that there is a fine line between “protecting the integrity of the sport” and forcing people to blindly toe the party line. NASCAR suffers repeatedly from trying to be absolutely perfect instead of just acknowledging reality. Reality isn’t bad.
Is corn-derived E15 a reasonable fuel choice to use on the track for this day and age? Sure.
Is corn-derived E15 the fuel of the future and the solution to all our future energy woes? Nope – and thankfully, NASCRA has started backing off the blind rhetoric – they’ve recently discussed looking toward a future time when cellulosic ethanol (ethanol produced from fibrous, non-edible plant matter like corncobs, stalks, switchgrass, etc.) is ready to be used in racing. It’s not ready right now, but the move to E15 is laying the groundwork for cellulosic E85. Baby steps are perfectly acceptable — like the new EFI system.
Is a throttle-body EFI system at all comparable to the technology in the cars you and I drive? Not at all. Is it a significant advance over the carburetor? Yep. Is EFI going to save a lot of fuel? No, not really. Is it going to save the teams money? Definitely not. Does it move NASCAR closer to the cars their manufacturers are trying to sell? It does.
Is it perfect? No.
Is that OK? Yes.
Brad Keselowski, the most recent secret finee, was tagged for his recent comments about electronic fuel injection. (A story broken by Jenna Fryer of the Associated Press – a grad of WVU!.)
“I’m not a big fan of it at all. Carburetor technology is 50 years old but is very simple. The benefit of a carburetor is that it’s very, very easy to police. That’s why NASCAR stuck with that,” he had added. “They’ve been pressured into switching it through the green initiatives. In reality it’s no more efficient than what we have, and it costs a lot.”
So here’s how NASCAR might have responded (if I had been in charge of PR for the day):
“We appreciate Brad Keselowski’s apprehensive feelings about switching to electronic fuel injection. Many people have negative initial reactions to any type of change. We look forward to hearing his comments after he has a chance to actually use the system in a few races. We expect 2012 to be an exciting, competitive season.
“But we must disagree with his assertions that the switch to EFI was motivated by trying to get good publicity, to save the teams money, or pressure from ‘green initiatives’. NASCAR has a large number of constituencies we try to satisfy: fans, manufacturers, sponsors, media partners, and drivers among them. Like most businesses in this country, we’re doing our best to understand how we can contribute to making the country less dependent on foreign energy sources and more energy efficient in general. The new EFI system is one more step in that direction.
“We realize that it is costing teams additional money in unusable inventory, purchasing new parts and training people – but that is part of the constantly changing nature of motorsports. We are doing our best to phase in changes and work with the teams to minimize the financial impact as much as possible.
“As for the suggestion of pressure from the ‘green initiatives’, NASCAR has been recycling oil and automotive fluids at the track for a very long time. Our newer programs (like track-based materials recycling) are being implemented because NASCAR believes in doing the right thing by our fans, our sponsors and our environment.
“While we respect all our participants’ rights to express their opinions, we hope they will do so in a responsible and constructive manner and work with us to make this a better sport for everyone.”
Physicists tend not to be the most subtle of people. But I think the above does a pretty good job of suggesting that Keselowski’s comments were just plain uninformed without name calling or secret monetary fines that only make it hard for people like me to defend them.
You need only listen to SiriusXM NASCAR radio for a little while to know that there are always going to be people who are unwilling (or unable) to follow a logical argument and who will stick to their opinions even in the face of outright contradictory evidence. Nothing NASCAR says or does – fines or statements – is going to change their minds. But there are also a lot of people who will respond to a well-intentioned appeal to reason.
And now y’all know why I’ll never get a job in public relations!
What they should have done is put out a statement like the one you wrote and fined him publicly. Other sports do it and the fan base doesn’t have issue with it. They just understand that it’s part of the sport and move on.
He said nothing wrong until he started talking about it being a publicity move. Frankly he went a little too far and the fine was deserved, but the fact that Nascar likes to hide these things makes it all look shady.
You just don’t question the integrity of the sanctioning body, which is what he did, but they sure aren’t helping themselves by secretly fining people.
Interesting, and a very well written article.
I’m told real PR people don’t say “chicken^$!%…
I’m of two minds on competitors criticizing NASCAR. On one hand we don’t want drivers afraid to speak their mind. I always preferred Darrell’s comments as a driver to Jeff Gordon’s (though Gordo is becoming more vocal in the past few years). On the other hand, I don’t think it serves the sport to be made to look bad in front of it’s fans and the media.
So, I guess, the question is “What should NASCAR do about it?”. Ignore it? Issue fines? Respond as in Diandra’s example?
If it were me, I’d probably meet privately with the critical driver and explain how his/her words are hurting the sport and if they felt things were going in the wrong direction, to please ask for a meeting to air his/her grievances.
Then, again, as a fan, I do enjoy hearing what the drivers think as it often represents what the fans are thinking, giving us a “vicarious” voice.
au contraire, Dr Dinadra, Your suggestion of what NASCAR should have said in response to Brad Keselowski’s EFI comments read like they came from a very experienced PR advisor! Looking forward to hearing you on Sirius Speedway with the Godfather and Angie!

A blond girl with green eyes found in a Roma family in Greece made headlines around the world.
DNA tests revealed that the child, known as Maria, aged about 4, was not related to the Roma couple with which she lived.
During the interrogation, the Roma couple gave at least five conflicting answers as to why Maria lived with them.
Greek police had suggested a possible connection with Bulgaria, from where the child could have been sold by her biological parents.
If the Bulgarian connection proves true, this would be no precedent. Children like her grow up traumatized, turns into sociopaths and victims of our own sick society, which brushes under the carpet all issues. But the issue stays there like an old would.
The old wound, which reminds us that the state has been completely ignoring child trafficking.
While Greek authorities are trying to solve the mystery of the 4-year old girl, such a case would have never been an issue on Bulgaria’s agenda.
The story of little Maria made headlines around the world, but there are hundreds of children, who are either victims of trafficking or violence, but most often of both.

How to Scan, Stitch and Edit Large Photosposted by RestorePS, May 30, 2013 3:28 PM — 4 comments
Working in photo restoration it's not uncommon to work on old photos that are rather large. Certainly round the turn of the 20th century there was a tendency to take photos on card backgrounds up to A3 size. So in the modern era how do you go about editing a photo that size?
And it's not just old photos. Print options these days mean all sorts of print sizes are available so it's not inconceivable that one day you'll want to edit a photo that's too large for your scanning area - a poster for example or a large wedding photo.
So this tutorial is a quick and easy guide to how you can produce a pristine image from a large image on a standard scanner that's not big enough to scan that image in one.
First of all let's start with the original photo - an old damaged one in this example.
This photo was a card mounted photo approximately A3 size. So to scan this effectively on a standard A4 screen scanner we need to scan the image in to four pieces - if your scanning area is smaller or the photo is bigger scan in to as many pieces as it takes. The important thing is to make sure you have all pieces of the photo and there is a little overlap so you can fit the photo correctly later.
Now with your scanned pieces of the photo you can load up your photo editing software and get cracking with the editing.
As this is a quick and easy guide I'm using Gimp because it's free and available to everyone but for those of us who use Photoshop the steps are identical.
First we need to open up our starting piece and create the right canvas size so that we have enough space to move in all the pieces and have the one large photo.
Expand the width and size of the canvas so the piece of the photo becomes a small photo in a larger canvas then save the image and close it.
Next reopen your saved large canvas size master photo and also open another piece of the photo.
Next hit ctrl and c - or copy - on the new piece of photo you've just opened, go to your master large canvas photo and hit ctrl and v - or paste - to paste it in to your large canvas piece.
Then using the "move tool" move the pasted piece of photo around until it matches up perfectly with your master photo image. This can be easily achieved if you change the image screen size to 50% - bottom left corner of the screen.
(In the above image the "move tool" is the icon on the far right of the second row of the tool box and we are using that to move the pasted image around so that we can marry it up perfectly with the other piece of the photo on the left)
(The screen size tab is at the bottom of the screen next to the words floating selection. This increases the size of the image so you can accurately fit the photo pieces together. For super accuracy go up to 100% image size).
Once you have both pieces fitting together perfectly you need to make sure the tone and lightness of both pieces match. If you don't there will be an obvious line down the finished photo that will show that the photo has been edited together.
(To adjust "brightness and contrast" click the colour tab on the top row and go down to Brightness-Contrast)
You can now play around with the brightness and contrast dials until you have a perfect match of tone and colour for both pieces.
Once you do hit Ctrl and H and the two pieces will be merged in to one.
Then follow the above steps again until you have all the pieces fitting together and have one full digital image.
You can then proceed to edit and improve the photo so that you have something like the below.
Hopefully the above is useful and straight forward enough.
It's my first tutorial so your thoughts would be appreciated.

In your tutorial you are assuming that the pictures are already perfectly rotated, maybe you should point it out. Also I don't understand why you save the file and then immediately reopen it...
May I suggest you also take a look at Hugin? It is an open source software and you can use it for automatically stitching pictures. :-)

Sticky Toffee Triumph
It is great to know that our puddings are appreciated by pudding lovers
Felicity a Sticky Toffee Pudding lover emailed recently.
"I just wanted to write and tell you how much I have enjoyed the little sticky toffee puddings you now sell in Waitrose. I've been a Great Taste Award judge for the last 2 years- and in that capacity I've blind tasted a LOT of puddings- it's my special area of expertise! I can safely say yours is the best yet. The sponge bit is so soft and moist, and there's plenty of sauce, which to my mind is always the best bit. And the small ones are just the right size- and brilliant to be able to buy just the one" Felicity Channel 4 NewsNvidia GeForce GTX 690 review
Astonishing levels of power for crazy amounts of cash, this is a card reserved for the privileged few
Nvidia smashed it out of the park with its GeForce GTX 680, but that clearly isn’t enough graphical grunt for the green team. In a surprise unveiling at the Nvidia Game Festival 2012 in Shanghai, CEO Jen-Hsun Huang gave us its dual-GPU beast, the GeForce GTX 690.
The formula for building one of these super-powerful cards is surprisingly simple. Two of Nvidia's GTX 680 cores are soldered onto a 280mm-long piece of PCB, with a small chip between the two to allow them to work together.
As is usual in dual-GPU cards, the cores have been clocked down a little, with the 1,006MHz stock speed of the GTX 680 now standing at 915MHz. Nvidias Turbo Boost technology remains intact, though, so that core clock will adjust up or down depending on how much work the GPUs are doing. Adjustments are made every millisecond, and the GTX 690's 915MHz core will hit a peak of 967MHz when it's at maximum load.
Aside from the clock drop, little of the GTX 680 has been changed. Each core is still accompanied by 2GB of 6,008MHz GDDR5 RAM, for a total of 4GB across the board. There have been no architectural changes, either, with the eight huge clusters serving each core still packing 192 stream processors each. Across the entire GTX 690, that means there are a mighty 3,072 stream processors and just over seven billion transistors.
Thats a formidable amount of pixel-pushing power and, as expected, it translated to ridiculous benchmark results. At Full HD, the card clearly isn’t being pushed: its 73fps in our 1,920 x 1,080 Very High quality benchmark, for instance, isn't that far ahead of the HD 7970's 60fps or the GTX 680's 57fps.
Crank up the resolution and detail, though, and the two cores get to work. Running Crysis at 2,560 x 1,600 saw its score barely drop to 70fps; the GTX 680 and HD 7970, by way of contrast, ran through the same test at 42fps.Nubian Heritage, Indian Hemp & Haitian Vetiver Soap, With Neem Oil,-11058

The New Consumer and Their Journey to Effectiveness, Balance & Personal GrowthRENO, Nev. --.
It's a work out that can burn around 500 calories in just thirty minutes, which means if you have a free lunch hour, you can pop in, get a full body work out, take a shower and have just enough time to get back in the office.
"I have an elliptical in my living room for crying out loud that I don't get on." said Tammy Wadsworth, a kickboxing novice.
Like many other mothers, Tammy Wadsworth can barely fit time in her schedule to sleep, let alone work out.
"I'm a full-time working individual, I have a daughter and family and all those other commitments that come with being an adult and plenty of excuses for not going to the gym," she said.
When Wadsworth found 9Round Fitness & Kickboxing three months ago, she ran out of excuses.
'I didn't have to worry about making a 6 p.m, class or making a 5:30 p.m. class when I work late and it just gets me 30 minutes in and out," she said. "it kicks my butt."
A half an hour gets you through nine different workouts, each round lasting three minutes. Once the bell goes off, you're onto a new routine.
"Every day it changes so you get a fresh new work out every time you step into the place," said Matt Vidal, manager and head trainer at 9Round.
It's not a one-size-fits-all kind of class. Each round is tailored to your needs, which keep folks like Tammy Wadsworth coming back.
When I first started, I couldn't get through 9Rounds. I thought I was going to pass out, honestly."
Three months later, she's seeing results that keep her motivated.
"I'm seeing more definition, I'm seeing just increased energy and muscles. Clothes fit better, always a bonus."
Each class also guarantees a personal trainer right by your side to encourage and teach you new routines.
"It's a great cardio work out. Everybody that wants to lose the pounds, get rid of this get rid of that; it's all about cardio burning; it's not about getting big bulky muscle," Vidal said. "If you want a nice lean summer body, this is where you get it."
9Round Fitness and Kickboxing is located at 748 S Meadows Pkwy, Reno, NV 89521.

THE INDIAN MISSIONARY
By Luther F. Addington
It seems very strange indeed that an Indian boy would want to
become a missionary among the white people. But there was such a boy.
His name was Dale, and he belonged to the Mingo tribe which lived on the
Ohio River.
Patrick Porter, who had a fort near Falling Branch on Clinch
River, went
with the Clinch Valley troops to fight Cornstalk at Point Pleasant in
1774. One night after the troops were told they could go home, there
came to Patrick Porter's campfire the notorious Chief Logan. Chief
Logan, tall and reddish-brown, clad in a hunting coat, moccasins and
leggins, tapped Patrick Porter on the shoulder and said,
"You are Patrick Porter. You live on Clinch River. I have
been to your fort. Many times I could have killed you, but I would not.
You good man. You good father to children who lived near your
fort."
Patrick Porter reached out a hand. The Indian chief shook it.
"What can I do for you, Chief Logan?" Patrick Porter
asked.
"Much," said the chief. "Not for me but for a
friend of mine."
"What is it, Chief Logan?"
Patrick
Porter held to his long rifle. A coon tail hanging from his cap flapped
in the wind. The air was chill. Leaves rustled as they swept along over
the woodland floor. It was autumn. Out of the dark came an Indian boy.
He was naked, save moccasins on his feet and a piece of deer skin about
his loins. "This is Dale," the Indian chief said. Patrick
Porter shook hands with the boy. "Glad to know you, Dale," he
said. The boy merely grunted.
The campfire crackled. A flame leaped up, lighting Dale's tired
face. Away in the woods an owl hooted. Chief Logan put a hand on Patrick
Porter's shoulder again.
"White people kill all of Dale's family. Kill all his kin.
Now he wants to go with white men and learn to read from their books. He
wants to preach the word of God."
Patrick Porter was amazed. He said, "The white people kill
your relatives, yet you want to go and live with them?"
Dale nodded.
"He want to go with good white
people, like you, Captain Porter. And I know you are good. I pick you to
take him."
Patrick Porter stooped and threw a fresh stick of wood onto the
fire. Sparks flew. Smoke twisted up in a spiral and was snatched by the
wind.
"Chief Logan," Patrick Porter said, "we white
people need to do some kind deed for your people because the whites have
been cruel. Especially have
they been cruel to your people, Chief Logan."
"Uh! Very cruel," Chief Logan grunted. He folded his
arms across his big chest.
"Then Patrick Porter will take Dale?"
"I should like very much to take him" Patrick Porter
replied. He paused and leaned heavily on his gun. Then he added,
"But I am afraid to take him. The Mingoes are still angry with the
white people. They will
follow me to my home and kill me for taking the boy."
"No, no!" said Chief Logan, shaking his head. "We
will fix that someway."
"I'm afraid we can't," Patrick Porter said. "Now
you take him away before your tribesmen come. The war is over. Let's
spill no more blood."
Chief Logan and the Indian boy went away into the woods. The
trees seemed to cry. Patrick Porter felt bad. He lay down by the fire,
but he could not sleep. He wondered whether Chief Logan would bring
Indian braves and attack his camp.
Early next morning Patrick Porter, lying near the campfire, heard
the leaves rustle. He leaped up, gun in hand, ready to shoot. But after
one close look he let the gun barrel drop. There before him stood the
boy Dale, alone. In his hand was a scrap of paper. He reached it toward
Patrick Porter who took it, turned to the firelight, and read in English
which
he knew a white man had written. But to the note was Chief Logan's
name. The note read:
"Mr. Porter, I ask you again to take Dale. I have fixed it
so Mingoes won't follow. I told them that Dale had been drowned in the
river while crossing."
Patrick Porter shook his head.
"I cannot take you," he said. "I tell you the
Mingoes will find you. They will kill me and all my people."
The Indian boy reached out his hands, pleading. He did not speak.
Patrick Porter's heart was touched too deeply for him to keep on
saying no.
"Very well," he finally said. "I will let you go.
I shall risk it. Now lie down here by the fire and rest."
Dale traveled all the way to Clinch River with Patrick Porter and
lived with him at the fort on Falling Branch near the river. He was a
happy lad, and he really tried to learn. Little by little he came to
understand English words. Then he begged to be taught to read and write.
Patrick Porter saw to it that he had a tutor.
Patrick Porter was himself a student of the Bible, and he
interested the Indian boy in its stories. After a few years, Dale was
able to read for himself.
"You need more name than Dale," Patrick Porter told him
one day. "And I am giving you the name Arter. From now on you are
Arter Dale."
"Good," said Dale, thumping his youthful chest. "I
like the name Arter Dale."
The boy grew to manhood, and there on Clinch River he married a
white girl. Today, many are the people who pride themselves in having in
their veins the blood of Arter Dale.
Arter became a leader in his community. He became a convert to
Christianity and later joinedthe Methodist Church. For many years he
served the Church as a minister preaching to the whitepeople along the
river valley.

Ciara O'Brien
Well, we knew it was coming. iTunes has revamped its pricing, meaning we’ll pay more for some new releases and more popular artists.
Well, I say we, but I’ve yet to be sucked in Apple and iTunes. I may be feeling a little smug about this today. And no, I’m not sorry.
Hmm.
When the market leader is providing wider selection, with greater quality (okay variable, but greater if you know what you’re looking for) and of course free, this move just seems puzzling.
Bang in a recession and little chance of getting caught and a moral dilemma turns into a no-brainer.
It has been mentioned elsewhere that this could lead to an increase in piracy. Bad move by the labels?
I live in Australia, but still use my BoI Visa card. I tried to register with the iTunes shop in Australia, but got kicked out as my card was not Australian.
I joined the Irish site, to find the songs I wanted at Eur0.99. They were on the Aussie iTunes at A$1.29 – however the exchange rate is currently 1euro = A$1.86.
So iTunes got a nice 50% write up against me !!! Seems like rip off Ireland has extended into cyberspace !!!
It has been mentioned elsewhere that this could lead to an increase in piracy. Bad move by the labels?
When’s the last time they made a good move?
i hate itunes with a passionI see your point man but I figure Priest tours so much because they are legends and people want to see them. They have put out SO much material that a Priest song is everywhere you look. Touring keeps the band close to the fans and I would think that is why they are so into it. Of course, this is all conjecture on my part but it does make sense when you think about it.
I read something once where Glenn mentioned that the band has an abundance of material and always does, even when they finish an album. Putting out another is likely not high on their list since they have so much material available. I think he said they always have a few songs that do not make the album so they just shelve them. Things like concept albums are more important to them since it offers them a chance to do something different and does not include old or pre-written material. The fact that the record label wants new albums is clear by virtue of the "live" release.
Priest have earned the right to do it their way, when they choose. I get that. As for what they may or may not "owe" us, I figure they try to meet that obligation by touring so much.

Martha Stewart is calling on her friends to write testimonial letters to Judge Miriam Cedarbaum. She asks them to "please include your opinion of my character, my work ethic, my integrity and my probity."
I'm not one of Stewart's friends. We've never met. But I do have an opinion of her character, based on a personal encounter once removed.
A Martha Stewart executive lives in my town. Not long ago, her daughter turned 13. Stewart threw the girl a bat mitzvah party at one of her mansions.
Among the guests was a friend's daughter. Naturally I was curious, so I did what any red-blooded gossipmonger would do: I grilled the kid. Had Martha actually been at the party?
"You mean the lady who owns the house? Sure. She talked to me for a long time." "About what?"
Shrug. "School, what I like to do, things like that. She talked to all the girls. She was really nice."
This is a small anecdote, but Stewart's negative public image is made of small anecdotes - the gardener she mistreated, the neighbor she quarreled with, the fights with her ex-husband, the hollering at her staff. Doubtless she can be imperious and difficult; self-made moguls tend to be. But she also has time for little girls.
I'm sure Cedarbaum will get many letters attesting to Stewart's character. I'm equally sure they won't matter. Martha Stewart is heading to prison. Federal rules call for her to serve 10 to 16 months.
Locking Stewart up is crazy. Her only crime was lying to federal investigators. That's wrong, but hey - the feds come around asking you questions, you might panic and fib, too. Especially if you felt (correctly) that you were getting set up to serve as an example of law-and-order prosecution.
Even if Cedarbaum agrees, she can't do anything about it. "Extraordinary circumstances" would permit her to give Stewart less than the guidelines require, but there are no such circumstances. Martha's good deeds and good character don't count. In fact, the rules specifically bar judges from considering a defendant's previous contributions to society.
Another means of sentence reduction is for the defendant to take "personal responsibility." But that usually applies only to people who admit their guilt. Stewart could have copped a plea. Instead she forced government to go to the trouble of convicting her. Post-trial contrition, even if it is genuine, won't keep her out of jail.
In a readers poll conducted by the New York Daily News, many people suggested that Stewart should do community service. After all, she actually has skills to offer. But under the current federal rules, which have been considerably tightened by the Bush administration, less restrictive confinement - including community service - is no longer a substitute for jail time.
Still, the Stewart case does provide an unintended service to the community. It shows how absurdly rigid the federal sentencing guidelines are. A lot of people in prison don't need to be there. The Stewart case calls attention to the problem in a dramatic way. And, while it may not be much comfort to Martha, that is potentially a good thing.Hi

Sent: Thursday, November 24, 2005 5 Mon Dec 5 07:01:48 2005Wildlife enthusiasts and nature lovers have started flocking to Assam’s two principal habitats of one-horned rhinoceros, Kaziranga National Park and Pabitora Wildlife sanctuary, which have been declared open for tourists for the winter till April-end.
Park authorities have found it tough to accommodate visitors in government lodges and guest houses in view of the unprecedented rush of tourists from abroad and within the country to Kaziranga National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
Fares for elephant safari and jeep safari have been hiked steeply. The increased rates for jeep safari for Kohora Range of the park is Rs 1,500, while the rate is Rs 1,600, Rs 2,500 and Rs 2,000 for Bagori, Burapahar and Agoratoli ranges, according to an official in Kaziranga Jeep Safari association. One jeep safari can accommodate six visitors accompanied by one forest guard.
The rate for elephant rides in Kaziranga Park has been increased by Rs 50 per head for Indian tourists and by Rs 525 per head for foreign tourists.
State Forest Minister Rakibul Hussain declared both Kaziranga and Pabitora parks open for visitors in presence of a large number of foreign and domestic tourists.
Located just about 45 kilometres away from the heart of Guwahati city, Pabitora Wildlife Sanctuary is known to have the highest density of great Indian one-horned rhinoceros.
Rhino population in the sanctuary has gone up from 54 in 1987 to 93 in 2012.
Pobitora recorded zero poaching from 2007-10 with only one rhino falling prey to poachers last year and one this year. The tourist inflow to the sanctuary has increased from 8,993 in 2006-07 to 18,779 in 2011-12.
The 38.81 sq km PobitoraPark was declared a wildlife sanctuary in 1998 and was brought under Guwahati Wildlife Division in 2006.
Besides the one-horned rhinoceros, both Kaziranga and Pabitora parks has variety of migratory birds that visit the wetlands inside the wildlife protection areas to feast on the aquatic species including varieties of fishes.
As per the rhino census carried out in March this year in Kaziranga National Park, it was found that the number of one-horned rhinos in the Park increased to 2,329 compared to the figure of 2,290 as per last year’s (2012) census.

The Blackhawks and Kings will face off in the Western Conference Final beginning Saturday at United Center (5 p.m. ET; NBCSN, TSN, RDS). The winner of the first postseason meeting between the teams since 1974 will advance to the Stanley Cup Final against either the Boston Bruins or Pittsburgh Penguins.
The Kings are trying to become the first team since the Detroit Red Wings in 1997 and '98 to win consecutive Cups. The Blackhawks, who ended a 49-year drought by winning it all in 2010, are going for their second Cup in three years.
"We're excited, we're looking forward to it, we're ready to play," defenseman Brent Seabrook, who scored the OT winner in Game 7, said of the Kings. "I think we found our game in the later games here in this series, and we're looking forward to getting that one started Saturday night."
Getting here wasn't easy -- both teams had to go seven games before winning bitterly contested conference semifinal series against one of their big rivals. Los Angeles edged the San Jose Sharks 2-1 in Game 7 on Tuesday; Chicago advanced with a 2-1 overtime victory against the Detroit Red Wings on Wednesday, capping the first rally from a 3-1 series deficit in the history of the franchise and the 25th in a best-of-7 series in League history.
"I think progressively we've had a much tougher series from the first round, and we expect them to keep getting tougher," Blackhawks coach Joel Quenneville said. "L.A., they've got the Cup, and they played two tough rounds in a row, and they know how to win. I think we have to make sure that we're well prepared, that we're excited about the opportunity."
Chicago, the Presidents' Trophy winner as regular-season champion, did have an easier time in the first round, polishing off the Minnesota Wild in five games; Los Angeles had to overcome a 2-0 deficit to beat the St. Louis Blues in six games.
After winning the first two rounds in nine games last spring, the Kings have needed 13 of a possible 14 this year. Though they're 7-0 at home in this year's playoffs and have won their past 14 games at Staples Center, the Kings are 1-5 on the road -- a huge turnaround from last year when they won their first 10 road games on the way to the first Stanley Cup in franchise history.
The home-ice edge could be significant -- Chicago is 6-1 at United Center this spring, and Los Angeles has managed eight goals on the road this spring.
The Blackhawks won two of three games between the teams this season -- they spoiled the Kings' banner-raising with a 5-2 victory at Staples Center on opening day and won 3-2 at Chicago on Feb. 17. The Kings outlasted the Blackhawks 5-4 in Chicago on March 25.
The teams have met once in the Stanley Cup Playoffs -- 39 years ago, when Chicago captured their opening-round series in five games.
Kings goaltender Jonathan Quick was brilliant in the series against the Sharks but has had his troubles against the Blackhawks during the regular season. Quick allowed 12 goals on 84 shots, a save percentage of .857, this season and is 6-11-1 all-time against Chicago. However, he's coming off a series in which he allowed 10 goals in seven games against San Jose and leads all goaltenders this spring with a 1.50 goals-against average, a save percentage of .948 and three shutouts.
No Kings player has been especially prolific against the Blackhawks during his career. Anze Kopitar, Los Angeles' leading scorer in each of the past six seasons, had a goal and two assists against Chicago in the three games this season and has seven goals and 16 points in 24 career meetings.
Blackhawks goaltender Corey Crawford, who has played every minute for Chicago this spring, split two decisions against L.A. during the regular season and is 5-3-0 against the Kings lifetime, allowing 20 goals in eight games.
The most successful Blackhawks player against the Kings during his career has been forward Patrick Sharp, who has 18 goals and 31 points in 26 games. Sharp also had the first goal in Game 7 on Wednesday, tying him with Sidney Crosby and Pascal Dupuis of the Pittsburgh Penguins for the most in this year's playoffs.
Chicago captain Jonathan Toews has also enjoyed success against L.A. -- he has 12 goals and 22 points in 21 career games, including a goal and an assist in each of the three meetings this season.
The Blackhawks are glad to have two days between games after ending one grueling series with another on the horizon.
"We know that this series we just played was one of the toughest we've had in a while," Sharp told NHL Network. "You look ahead to the Kings -- it's only going to get harder. They're a big, strong, fast, physical team. They've got a great golatender, they protect their net well. It's that time of year where whoever you face it's going to be a battle. We're just excited to move on."Check out appoLearning.com, because your kids deserve the very best educational apps!

Hey guys! I wanted to share with you this photo from InTouch because you can totally see what my belly looks like after giving birth! Sure, as anyone would, I hope to get back to my pre-pregnancy weight, in a healthy way, as soon as possible. But!
xoxo,
Holly
good on you holly! i remember i went out 2 weeks after having my son and got the same reaction…”when are you due?” LOL. I just brushed it off. Thanks for being real!
I love this! I had a few people ask me when I was due in the weeks after I had my kids (especially my last baby). It was embarrassing at the time but people don’t realize that a woman can’t snap back into shape days after giving birth! It takes a few weeks for the uterus to shrink back and even longer to lose the pregnancy weight and I think it’s wonderful that you are showing the reality of the situation. And you still look amazing! Congrats!
I’m so worried bout to have my lil any day now. I really want to get my old figure back ASAP….
Thanks Holly for always keeping it real!
Xxxx
Love your post! Very honest and real! I wish other artists could do the same, because some people make crazy things to get back the old shape. When the normal is exacly what you describe! Luv u so much!
Your beautiful Holly and your even a bigger idol to me for the way you are. I wish ppl could understand pregnancy and weight gain is life and it takes tie to get that body you had back. The world is so full of poisonous ppl and their comments that it actually takes a toll on someone physically and mentally when they feel they have to live to others expectations or get slammed for not. I love the woman you are an congratulations to you and your hubby:)
Holly, you are beautiful! I love that you are so down to earth and show people what real life is like. Its not all glamorous all the time. Good Luck on getting your body back, and Congrats on being a mom.
Thank You for saying what you did, and feeling that way. So many of the Star’s are more concerned about their figure after having a baby, than the baby itself! A woman is beautiful no matter what her stomach looks like. You’ll get there “the healthy way”, which is the best way! ~Hugs~
LOVE LOVE LOVE this!! Ive had 2 children and I dont have the same body as I used to. When I see celebrities that look like they never had a kid the day after they had a kid lol it is very discouraging. Im having trouble getting the weight off because I lack motivation but seeing you so truthful and open is motivating and I applaud you for standing up for all of us moms! You look beautiful as always!!
Where you really 2 weeks late? Heard that on E! News last night. But you never really know if it’s truthful or not.
I love you for who you are. Simple, honest, and kind. I admire you so much already but this just gets the blood pumping in the heart. Thank you for being real! I know you will get that fabulous body of yours back in no time. Wishing you all the best!
At first I was thinking, this chick is nuts! That was just from the title then I read the article. Love. Good luck loosing the weight. Took me just under a year and I have been stuck at that weight since. Ugh. Take your time. Nursing will help more then you would ever know.
Holly, you are so awesome! I don’t have any children but can understand the crazy amount of pressure the media pus on women to look thin immediately after birth. THANK YOU for being a real woman and showing off your amazing body!
Been working on the baby weight for 26 years!! Two big babies over 9lbs each and 2 c seat ions took a toll on my tummy! It’s alot of work being a mom but well worth it!! Good luck new mamas !! Holly enjoy !!

Thank you so much for showing other moms that being back in your prepregnancy clothes by the time you leave the hospital is just not the norm. It’s about time more celebs were honest with women!
Wow awesome of her!!
Thank you for showing real pictures
Well done Holly! Finally a celeb showing what a real woman looks like after giving birth!
You still look amazing tho!
After reading this post I almost cried! I also just had a baby a few months ago, and trying to get back to my pre-baby weight has been much harder than I expected, especially since I’m breastfeeding! (Those last 10 pounds suck!!) But seeing this photo from someone as well known for their body as you, Holly, really is inspirational. You and your daughter are so beautiful! Thank you for being such a great role model for other women!
I hope you are enjoying every moment of motherhood, it is the most amazing thing anyone can experience!
Love you!!!
Yay for you, Holly Madison! You are truly an inspiration for all the right reasons. You really showed you are brave and not afraid to be real. Congrats to you and the precious little one. As one mom to another, I know it sounds trite, but they do grow up way too fast! Savor every moment!
Love to you and yours
Absolutely beautiful! Thank you for being honest and real, makes me love ya even more!
I applaud you for this post. I am not familiar with your history as a celebrity, but even more so that you are, I respect that you are incredibly real. You will be an awesome mom and role model. Thank you!
As a nurse, I am so happy to see you post this picture. You are a role model to so many people. Thank you.
You are so real holly! I have always loved you and I wish you and rainbow the best. There is NOTHING like motherhood! Its absolutely amazing
Holly is a sweet heart. …
Thank you, Holly! I’m expecting my 2nd and so appreciate you sharing your story with completely honesty!
I can’t even express how awesome this is. We need more women like you. I think most of us know rationally what a woman looks like just after giving birth, and we know how long it can take to bounce back. But when we look in the magazines and see these famous women who just gave birth and are thinner then ever before, it is very disheartening. Thank you for not being afraid to stand up and show us what is real.
I started a Facebook page for moms, like me, who has babies in February to show off our after baby bodies!!
It’s called February 2013 Beautiful After-Baby Bodies! (clever right? Lol) anyway, thanks for doing this! Maybe you could stop by our group page and post your picture like we did. (: It took a lot of courage from us, as I’m sure it did for you. You look great!...
Hers what i posted in my baby center group to the other Feb 2013 moms:
I’m really self conscious. Even before baby, I couldn’t wear a bikini. However, if we did something like this, I’d be in. If it helped them, maybeit would help me/us? Instead of just here in our private birth club… What do you think about staying a Facebook page for us and posting/tagging our photos there? We already do it here, maybe making it “public” will boost our spirits!
Thank you for being open & honest about your post-pregnancy body. More women need to take this stance!

I think you look great Holly!!!
You are awesome for that!News story
Modernising and strengthening insolvency processes
To improve public confidence in the insolvency profession and to modernise the insolvency process a package of changes come into force on 1 October 2015.
In summary the changes:
- reform the way insolvency practitioners gain authorisation to practice
- simplify when to report to creditors about appointing and releasing administrators
- strengthen the regulation of insolvency practitioners and our.
We have sent a special edition of Dear IP, our quarterly technical newsletter, to insolvency practitioners setting out these changes in more detail. If you have not received this newsletter or would like a copy please contact: Dear.IP@insolvency.gsi.gov.uk.
Published 18 September 2015Mention classic Taradale-Havelock North Hawke's Bay premier rugby matches of the past couple of decades and it doesn't take long for Luke Ottley's and Mike Chaffey's names to pop up in the conversation.
When there were situations to be sorted out, Taradale's Chaffey and Havelock North's Ottley were among their respective team's go-to blokes. The pair will have the opportunity to sort each other out when they meet in one of the fights at the Hastings Pak 'N Save Battle for Life Charity Boxing event at the Hawke's Bay Opera House in Hastings on September 21.
It will be their first boxing bout.
"We used to do boxing as part of our pre-season training with Northland but there was never any sparring," former Northland and Hawke's Bay rugby representative Ottley said.
Chaffey, 38, and Ottley, 35, first met when they were in the Hawke's Bay Sevens training squad together in 1995.
The pair, who are both builders, are well known for their mongrel on the paddock and have recently recovered from injuries - Ottley a knee injury and Chaffey his problem back which forced a switch from his hooking role to the loose forwards in 1999.
"Everyone knows how competitive we both are ... I'll be looking to hit his sore knee and Luke will be aiming to punch me in the back," Chaffey quipped.
While both are expected to weigh in around the 95kg mark Ottley will have a four- centimetre height advantage.
The Ryan Whittaker-trained Ottley is following former Havelock North teammates including Graham Hawkins and Andy Barham into the ring and like the Dan Digby-trained Chaffey won't be short of support.
"Aaron is encouraging everyone at the rugby club to buy a table and come and watch me get taken out," Chaffey said referring to fellow former Magpie and Taradale rugby player Aaron Hamilton.
An eight handicapper at golf, Chaffey, said he is enjoying the training and if the fight goes well he may become a regular on the charity boxing circuit. Ottley said the aerobic aspect of the training for the three two-minute round bout is tough compared with rugby trainings but he is relishing the benefits.
Event organiser Patrick O'Brien is thrilled the fourth annual BFL will proceed after fears last year's one may have been the last because of a lack of financial support. In addition to Pak 'N Save coming on board as the major sponsor, the Sport Hawke's Bay-sponsored Blue Team will support the Prostate Cancer Foundation of New Zealand and the Raisey's Original-sponsored Pink Team will support The New Zealand Breast Cancer Foundation.
O'Brien, the 2012 Ngati Kahungunu Sports Awards Administrator of the Year award- winner, will take on Hawke's Bay kickboxer Shaun Rankin in one of 10 confirmed bouts.
Hawke's Bay's Pane "The Punisher" Haraki will take on fellow world champion kickboxer Mike Angove of Auckland in the feature fight. Angove has battled cancer in the past.This event has passed.

You ever read a Craigslist ad that was too good to be true? Then you saw the product being hawked, right there in your face, and come to find out the real thing was less than advertised. Doesn't that just piss you off?
Well, we were hipped to one Craigslist poster who's selling a nifty, silver SUV. What grabbed us about the post was that it read like part stand-up routine, part Pimp C rap lyric. In fact, the best thing about it was that besides being funny, the ad didn't hide the vehicle's faults.
"I'm just naturally hilarious," said Lara Wright who wrote the post. She's sold plenty of items on Craigslist (even gave away some kittens), but never went with the tongue-in-cheek approach. "It's not a BMW or anything," she said. She was upfront about her SUV's 210,000 miles and faulty transmission.
Since we're pretty she's going to sell her vehicle before the close of the week, we wanted to share (with her permission) the full text of this diamond of a Craigslist ad.
"you need a car u say? shit, i got that bad boy right here! does it run? hell yes! like shit through a goose! this war wagon has some awesome silver inspired paint that will attract all the hotties! male, female, don't matter, you gonna get wall to wall booty when you pimp this bad-boy down the avenue!
So whats good about that hell beast? SHIIIIIIIIIT!!!! whats not good, son! Its got some comfortable ass seats, because i been sitting in them for like, EVER! so they are already butt dip shaped! 4 wheels on this mug! you buy the truck, you get the air in the tires for F-R-E-E! Do people like these trucks? you know it! it got some bitchin stickers all up on the back of it!
SO you know its a badass truck! the things got 210,000 miles on it! trucks dont get that many miles unless you take GOOD ASS CARE OF THEM!
So here's the skinny on the bad! the tranny slips! but by slips, i mean, it still runs! i drove that thing from baytown to montrose DAILY! for like 8 months! i just moved to the trose so i could save them gas BUX! i got a smaller car w 4 cylinders of dopeness! i don't need this monster anymore! oh, its 4wd btw! so you can like drive over mountains and shit! its a 6 cylinder engine w/ 4.0 liters of FIRE BREATHING DEVIL ASS STANK POWER!
dont be lame! bring me that uncle sam cash and put some wheels up under your sexy self! ax for LARA!"
To our surprise the 27-year-old Texan doesn't worry about Craigslist horror stories and sells stuff regularly, but there are a few precautions she takes. Call it her Craigslist rules:
- Always meet in a public space.
- Tell your friends you're going to meet someone from Craigslist.
- Never let somebody from Craigslist come to your house.
She had a couple of potential buyers lined up on Wednesday night, and a few email inquiries. Let's see whatView single post by javal1

Good to see some well thought-out comments about this subject. You both sound torn on the subject of the bail-outs, and actually I salute you for that. One of the problems we have as a nation is we always want to fight things on ideological grounds. Unfortunately. ideology isn't always aligned with reality.
In my gut- just pure instinct - I'm opposed to bailouts. But how realistic is that? I would have liked to see Fannie Mae and Freddy Mac go under. Problem being they would take half the US mortgages with them. Instinctively, I would say let the car companies go under, after all it was their stupidity and greed that put them where they are. I could even justify in my mind the auto workers losing their jobs, since it's also their greed that got them where they are.
But when you start to think of the myriad of secondary industries they would take with them: sand pit workers who supply the sand for the auto glass, glazers who make the windshields, metal workers who fabricate, computer chip makers, plastics workers, retail auto supply store workers, and on and on. I really do think the economy could collapse. Do we want that for the sake of ideology?
Just two small points. The $75,000 per worker thrown around is deceiving. Truth is that (and this is an amazing stat if you think about it), it costs the Big Three $35,000 per year per
active employee
to pay the legacy costs of those already retired. That figure is added in to come up with the "they earn $75,000 a year" line. Sad to say, but someone down the line's going to have to tell the retirees "sorry, we tried, but your benefits are going to have to be cut or eliminated".
Second point: boy do we have a bunch of idiots in Congress (both parties). We have Dingell (D) from Michigan who has catered to the stupidity of the Auto industry at every chance, right up to today. And we have Shelby (R) and other Southern Senators demanding they go into bankruptcy because they think they're protecting the foreign carmakers in their states. Wonder if they ever stopped to think about all the non-union workers in their states involved in the secondary industries I mentioned will go under. Idiots.
Damn, now my fingers are tired. Good thread.

The departure is said to be amicable. Morfi was responsible for TNA getting a lot of the NYC-area media and local sports appearances for the Manhattan Center tapings. He has said that he would be open to helping the company in the future.
Also leaving the company is TNA’s Production Chief Engineer Jaymee Sharp. He has given notice, and will start work for another Nashville-based company.

While tough economic times have hurt many charities financially, Creative Acres has been dealing with additional challenges brought on by the states extreme weather. Over the last five years, the no-kill, free-roam animal sanctuary has been through a blizzard and a flood but it’s this year’s drought that has taken the greatest toll on the non-profit organization.
“This year has been really hard because usually I’m stocked up for food in September and everything is done and I can begin my fundraising but this year I have just been spending my time in search (of funding),” Director Maxine Mager said, adding a lot of the usual grants have not come through because of the economy and four of them aren’t around any more.
Mager said the drought has caused the cost of animal feed to triple, and in some instances, quadruple. She said chicken scratch that used to cost between $5 and $7, currently costs between $13 and $20 and that the sanctuary goes through approximately 40 to 50 bags a month. The grass hay that used to cost $5 a bale now costs $16 a bale and she estimates 400 bales will be needed to get the animals through the winter.
“We’re never gonna close, people know my passion, but we definitely need the public’s support more than ever because we’re trying to play catch up,” she said.
Creative Acres has a growing wish list of things it could use in order to “catch up” before winter. Mager said money is the best donation because it can be used to purchase feed, medicine and help with veterinary services, but that the sanctuary could also use supplies such as dog food, cat food, scoop-able litter, paper towels, and disposable gloves. In addition to supplies, the sanctuary could use volunteers and skilled workers who can help with various construction and roofing projects.
Creative Acres is unique because more than 400 animals, of 100 different species are allowed to roam freely on approximately 40 acres of sanctuary property. Dogs, cats, chickens, ducks, sheep, miniature horses, emu, peacocks, guinea pigs, chinchillas, sugar gliders and parrots are just a few of the species who have found a home at the sanctuary.
According to Mager, the sanctuary also does a lot of work with the military, children and individuals with special needs. Mager is also working to start a CLAW, or Central League of Animal Welfare, where lawyers and veterinarians can help in legal and medical matters as well as investigations.
For more information about Creative Acres, visit its website at or contact Maxine at 303-659-4792. Donations can be sent directly to Creative Acres at PO Box 1143, Brighton, CO 80601 or through giving first at.

Read and share your thoughts on this storyDuring the past two weeks, Star reporters witnessed vehicles throughout the Mile Square adorned with sheriff-issued placards, clogging up prime metered space and violating the geographic limits. / KELLY WILKINSON / The Star
More
The Marion County Sheriff's Department decided Tuesday to invalidate all of its 2,468 parking placards as of Oct. 1 out of concern that some drivers have been abusing the privilege by using metered spaces and loading zones as their personal free parking spot.
The decision comes a day after the city of Indianapolis said it was revoking its 850 placards, also because of misuse concerns.
Both agencies say they were prompted by an Indianapolis Star probe that documented instances where placards were not used as they were intended, hogging spaces in front of businesses intended for customers for hours at a time.
Unlike the city, the sheriff won't physically collect all of the bumper-sticker-shaped dashboard placards. But after Oct. 1, meter-readers will not honor them, Sheriff's Chief Deputy Kerry J. Forestal said, and drivers who use the placards instead of feeding the meter will be ticketed.
"I'm sure the vast majority of people haven't abused them," Forestal said. "And the few that did, or who misunderstood (the restrictions), must realize these are the repercussions."
The Sheriff's Department will soon reissue to its 1,077 employees a newly designed windshield sticker that is to be used only for short-term, work-related business.
The hundreds of non-employees who were issued placards -- including City-County Council members, political party officials and workers in the Marion County prosecutor's office -- won't get new ones or be able to apply for them.
That means that as of Oct. 1, and at least until a new policy is in place, no one is supposed to use a placard issued by the city or county.
Indianapolis Public Safety Director Scott Newman wants the City-County Council to create a new policy that overhauls existing city codes and provides more oversight on their use.
The Marion County prosecutor's office also hopes to work with the council on a new set of rules. The Star observed several employees of that office using their placards outside the intended area.
Spokesman Matthew Symons said the office would look into any misuses. He said the placards help employees who work off-site attend meetings and court proceedings Downtown. Until a new system is in place to ensure those staffers convenient spots, Symons said, the prosecutor's office will reimburse employees for commercial parking.
Combined, the city and sheriff plan to remove 3,300 placards from city streets by next week's deadline.
"It's great for us," said Joe Dayan, executive director of Indianapolis City Market, which relies on walk-up and drive-in traffic to support its fresh-food and mom-and-pop indoor vendors. "I think it will free up a lot of spaces. Not having parking options hurts us considerably."
Placards for decades were considered an inexpensive political perk. But in a thriving Downtown, they've become a nuisance for business owners who rely on the meters to provide quick access for potential customers.
Some placards designed for short-term business near the City-County building and the county jail have been used as an apparent substitute for a paid spot in a parking garage. During the past two weeks, Star reporters witnessed vehicles throughout the Mile Square parked in loading zones and at metered spaces.
Jim Enea, a Marion County special deputy assigned to the U.S. Marshals, uses his pass to park across the street from his job at the Birch Bayh Federal Building at 46 E. Ohio St.
"I guess I can drive all the way over to the Sheriff's Department and use their parking," he said after being told Monday of the sheriff's plan.
In his job as an intelligence analyst, Enea visits other police districts about five times a week, but he said not having a parking pass would not interfere with his ability to do his job.
"I'd walk (to the car)," he said. "It's no big deal."
The decision should provide more enforcement teeth to workers for Denison Parking, the city contractor, who were handcuffed by misunderstood or blatantly ignored policies on how the placards could be used.
"We're happy to do whatever the city asks us to do," said Scott Gould, a Denison general manager. "We don't know what that is yet."
As far as revenues for the city increasing, Gould responded: "You don't have to be a rocket scientist to know it will go up to some degree. What that is, who knows?"

Students who drop out, or disengage, prior to completing secondary education are at an increased risk of a range of poor social and well-being outcomes, and in turn experience reduced opportunities over the course of their lives. Although there is a body of literature identifying strategies within educational settings to counter risk factors for young people dropping out, little is known about perceptions of students in receipt of these strategies. This paper reports on a study conducted within a high school in Melbourne, Australia. Most students attending the school are at high risk of dropping out due to socio-cultural, behavioural, or mental health issues. The school utilizes alternative education practices to provide a calm and therapeutic environment to re-engage students with education, while providing a curriculum that adheres to mainstream standards. This paper reports on findings from an online questionnaire conducted with 62 students attending the school. The findings suggest that the students disengaged from mainstream schools because of a lack of support from their teachers, bullying, or behavioural issues. Students described their reasons for re-engaging with this current school as being the culture and structure of the school as well as their relationships with staff. Based on these findings, it appears that positive staff/student relationships developed and maintained under the therapeutic approach may be an effective strategy for engaging young people in education.
1. Purpose
In Victoria, Australia, one in five young people do not complete secondary school (Year 12 or its equivalent) (Victorian Auditor-General, 2012). Students who dropped out, or disengaged prior to completing secondary education were at an increased risk of poor physical and mental health and social problems, and in turn experienced reduced opportunities over the course of their lives (Borrell et al., 2011; Lamb & Markussen, 2011; McHugh, Horner, Colditz & Wallace, 2012). Unfortunately, young people who were already socially or economically disadvantaged were at a greater risk of disengaging from education (Lamb & Markussen, 2011; McHugh et al., 2012). Not completing school further compounded such disadvantage.
There is a broad body of literature focused on student ‘engagement’ with school, although definitions vary and the term engagement embodies a multitude of concepts, including involvement, investment, attention, interest, and effort (Klem & Connell, 2004; Roffey, 2012; Roorda, Koomen, Spilt & Oort, 2011; te Riele, 2006). A particularly useful definition of educational engagement was described as “the quality of a student’s connection or investment with the endeavour of schooling and hence with the people, activities, goals, values and place that compose it” (Roorda et al., 2011, p. 495). This definition encompassed a student’s sense that education was a valuable investment that was relevant to their current and future life. It also referred to a sense of connection with, and interest in, the specific activities conducted in school on a day-to-day level.
In contrast to definitions which focus on individual student attitudes, many authors highlighted the structural dimensions of student engagement and disengagement from education. Socio-economic disadvantage for example, was often cited as a barrier to engagement in an education system that generally required students to have both financial and social stability to participate effectively (Burns, Collin, Blanchard, De-Freitas & Lloyd, 2008). Australian research has shown that homelessness or low socio-economic status (SES) were major risk factors for student disengagement (Marjoribanks, 2003; Ross & Gray, 2005; Sullivan et al., 2009). Additionally, parental education level (such as lack of university education) and occupation type (e.g. employment in a classically blue collar occupation such as trades or factory work) increased the likelihood of students disengaging (Baron, 2008; Berthelsen & Walker, 2008; Smyth, 2006). A series of individual factors coincided with this, such as academic failure, illiteracy, lack of practical or emotional support for education in the home, drug and alcohol abuse, or family violence (Beck & McNally, 2011; Borrell et al., 2011; te Riele, 2011). Cultural factors also influenced disengagement. Indigenous students and those who do not have English as a first language (in English speaking countries) were also at risk (Beck & McNally, 2011; te Riele, 2011). International literature identified a similar set of structural and individual risk factors including poor housing, crime, family breakdown, and a family history of low academic achievement or lack of educational goals (Burns et al., 2008; McHugh et al., 2012; Tsai & Cheney, 2012; Watson, 2011). These risk factors contributed to an increased likelihood of young people disengaging from school prior to completing their final year of school.
There was a growing body of research identifying strategies within educational settings to counter the above-mentioned risk factors and support student engagement in education. Strategies that supported engagement included: small class sizes, opportunities for student involvement in decision making, a flexible school curriculum, a whole school culture embodying support across the school, a sense of community, and a positive atmosphere. School support of relationships were highlighted as important, including the promotion of student/teacher relationships that were respectful and non-judgemental, the promotion of strong peer relationships within school, and the provision of quality school facilities and resources (Borrell et al., 2011; Burns et al., 2008; Kellock, 2012; te Riele, 2006).
The relationship between teachers and students was of central importance to a student’s experience of school and thus his or her engagement in education in general (Roffey, 2012). Negative or conflict-ridden relationships between teachers and students may lead to students developing a sense of fear and mistrust of school, particularly where students have other risk factors that made it difficult for them to engage (Jennings & Greenberg, 2009). Conversely, a strong, positive relationship with a teacher or adult mentor dramatically changed a young person’s perception of the school environment, producing a sense of the school as a safe space and opening a door for engagement in educational activities (Klem & Connell, 2004; Tsai & Cheney, 2012). For disadvantaged students in particular, supportive relationships with school staff were described as a ‘bridge’ into the educational system that would unlikely have been created by other means. Teacher/student relationships provided a crucial interpersonal, human connection that was key for many of these students to engage with a system that was difficult or uncomfortable for them (te Riele, 2006; McHugh et al., 2012; Smyth & McInerney, 2009).
This paper reports on some preliminary findings from a study of students who attended a high school which had adopted an alternative educational model that had a specific emphasis on building strong relationships between staff and students. All students who participated in the study had previously experienced disengagement from a mainstream school setting and had subsequently re-entered the education system within the context of this school. The paper focuses on students’ reports of their reasons for disengaging with education and factors that assisted them to re-engage, with a particular focus on the role of their relationships with staff at the school in facilitating this process. The broader research project employed methods that included interviews with students, parents and staff, and participant observation within a qualitative paradigm. This paper, however, focused on one aspect of the study, an online questionnaire that all students attending the school were invited to complete. The questionnaire was undertaken at the beginning of the project to provide some background information about students to inform the qualitative component of the study.
2. Perspective(s) or theoretical framework
The school in this study can be described as a public high school located in an outer suburban area of Melbourne, Victoria. The school follows a model which emphasizes staff-student relationships (SSRs) as central to supporting and engaging students. In contrast to mainstream school models, there was a limited focus on behaviour management as a means of discipline or as a conduit for change among students. Strongly influenced by Bowlby’s (1982) theory of attachment, the school model is driven by an understanding that in order for students to make personal and academic progress, their capacity to form secure attachments with staff members is key (Riley, 2010). Bowlby advocated the importance of children developing consistent, secure attachment with at least one adult to achieve optimal social and emotional development (Bowlby, 1982). With respect to education, Bowlby’s theory can be applied with the development of a school model that emphasizes the importance of predictable classroom structures and expectations. This ensures interactions with staff are consistent, safe, and reliable to enable strong SSRs to develop (Howie, 2012).
In Australia, Bowlby’s approach is translated into a school-based framework for working with young people known as “Calmer Classrooms” (Downey, 2007). The approach claims that “A strong attachment to their school can provide a child with stability in an otherwise unstable world: offering relationships, maintaining friendships, providing positive and enjoyable learning opportunities and ultimately building resilience and hope” (Downey, 2007, p. 28). The approach is consistent with existing research that demonstrates a strong teacher/student relationship can support students’ school engagement, attendance, and achievement (Klem & Connell, 2004; Roorda et al., 2011). Supportive relationships have helped students to thrive socially, emotionally, and academically and act as a protective factor for adolescent health and well-being (Jennings & Greenberg, 2009). At the core of the ‘Calmer Classrooms’ model are relationship-based practices that focus on creating interpersonal connections and diffusing conflict.
Staff/Student relationships (SSRs) and disadvantaged students
The school in which this study was located is in the northern suburbs of Melbourne, in what is traditionally a working class area characterised by “low-income, low educational attainment, high unemployment and jobs in relatively unskilled occupations” (profile.id, 2012, para.2). The Australian Bureau of Statistics reported that non-school completion rates in this location were high. For instance, data from 2006 indicated that over one third (35.2%) of students in the area had left school before finishing their fourth year of secondary school (Year 10). By comparison, the average rate for Melbourne at the same time was 27.9% (Kellock, 2012).
The impact of staff/student relationships (SSRs) appear to be more important for students of low socio-economic background and those with learning difficulties or behavioural problems (Roorda et al., 2011). Potentially this was explained by the already tenuous sense of engagement these students may have with school. They may be more easily alienated by negative SSRs than students who were better pre-disposed to cope in a school environment (Tsai & Cheney, 2012). Similarly, positive SSRs may be more personally and academically important for students who find school systems difficult to navigate (Lamb & Markussen, 2011; McHugh et al., 2012).
Supporting SSRs in a school setting
The social and emotional capacity of staff have played an important role in the types of relationships they are able to build with students (Jennings & Greenberg, 2009).Teacher/student relationships can be fostered by a number of teacher characteristics or emotion based traits, including empathy, warmth, understanding, effortful engagement, and caring (Cornelius-White, 2007; Liberante, 2012; McHugh et al., 2012). To mold strong SSRs, teachers themselves have generally required a high level of social and emotional competence, self-awareness, social awareness, and self-regulation, as well the capacity to engage authentically with students (Jennings & Greenberg, 2009). Often teachers inherently hold these social and emotional competencies (Jennings & Greenberg, 2009). However, this may not be the case, particularly as educational staff have been frequently exposed to highly pressured, emotive situations, such as managing difficult or aggressive students, within which they have found it difficult to regulate their own emotional responses. Alongside this, a teacher’s social and emotional competence may be affected by a range of factors including access to co-teacher support, principal/district leadership, access to professional development opportunities, and the level of pressure and stress associated with their teaching load (Jennings & Greenberg, 2009). Policy advocates have argued that school models should incorporate support for students to be able to establish at least one long-term relationship with a school-based adult and that schools should have a deliberate focus on building the competencies of staff to enable them to better engage with students at an interpersonal level to develop strong SSRs (McHugh et al., 2012; Jennings and Greenberg, 2009; Saunders & Saunders, 2001).
Alternative educational settings
Non-mainstream schools are often well placed to provide an environment in which strong SSRs thrive. There are several reasons for this. Most alternative schools have small student numbers and small class sizes overall, which has enabled greater interaction between students and teachers and a more personalized relationship between students and teachers. Some studies have also suggested that alternative school models that allowed students a high level of decision making about their own learning and input into the running of the school facilitate exhibited more genuine and respectful relationships between staff and students (Watson, 2011). Many alternative schools also offered a creative and relaxed environment where there were opportunities for interaction between staff and students that was less structured and more social. (Watson, 2011). What has been shown to make a difference for students in many alternative school settings compared to mainstream schools was the school’s capacity to impart a sense that an adult genuinely cared about the student and about his or her educational achievement (Cornelius-White, 2007; Jennings & Greenberg, 2009; Tsai & Cheney, 2012). This helped students feel more noticed by teaching staff and more included in the school (Saunders & Saunders, 2001). While models such as this may not be possible to achieve in all educational settings, they may still offer insight into strategies that may be transferable to all schools.
3. Methods
Established in 2007, the school of study was a public secondary school with an enrollment of 195 students in 2013. Students ranged in age from 11-20, and it was the only school in the area that offered an alternative to mainstream government or private education for young people aged under 15 (Kellock, 2012). The school provided a flexible teaching model that recognised many students had in the past or are currently experiencing homelessness, childhood trauma, drug and alcohol use, family violence, poverty, involvement with youth justice or state care, family violence abuse and neglect, teen pregnancy, parenthood, or mental illness. As such, many students who attended the school found it difficult to attend regular school hours. Rather, students were expected to attend three two-hour classes a week.
The school had a policy of no detention, suspension, or expulsion as deterrents to unwanted behaviour. Upon enrollment, students committed to following three expectations: 1). To maintain a safe and respectful classroom environment for yourself and others; 2) To allow fellow students to work in the classroom free from disruptions; and 3) To participate in school work. An individualized learning approach included students formulating their own learning plan with staff which was then followed in the classroom. Students’ workload and difficulty of tasks was set at a level that was achievable but extended them and was agreed upon between the teacher and student. Young families were supported, and there was a class specifically set up for young mothers. The school provided students with food and drinks in the kitchen to which they could help themselves at any time. Students were allowed to smoke (outside school grounds), there was no uniform, and the use of bad language, while discouraged, was not disciplined unless it was directed at someone with hurtful intentions.
The therapeutic approach utilized in the school’s philosophy was applied in policy and practice at the school. Prior to enrolling at the school, all students attended a meeting with the school’s intake worker. This was a process that took between two to three weeks and involved the intake worker building a relationship with the student, demonstrating at all times respect and unconditional positive regard for students. During the intake process, students were introduced to staff, a step that was intended to assist students to begin developing a relationship with staff.
Classes had 10-15 students enrolled, and each class was assigned one teacher, one wellbeing team member, and a teacher’s aide to work with the students. The students stayed in the same class and kept the same teacher and well-being worker throughout their time at the school. It is important to recognize that although all students had a dedicated well-being worker and teacher, they tended to refer to all of the staff as teachers; as such, references to teachers made by students in the data are likely to also refer to the well-being staff (Principal, 2011). The literature reported earlier in the paper referred specifically to TSRs as this is the language more commonly used; however, given the focus on all staff in this school, from here on these relationships will be referred to as staff/student relationships (SSRs).
“Circle time” ws a useful example of how building therapeutic relationships were coupled with curriculum delivery and explicit teaching in the school. Each class began and ended with “circle time” where students and staff sat in a circle outside of the formal teaching space. At the beginning of class teachers began their explicit teaching and used the time to model prosocial behaviours to be observed and absorbed by students. At the end of each class, the students and staff returned to “circle time,” where staff provided explicit feedback to students regarding their achievements in class and provided a space for students to reflect and highlight their own behaviours or achievements that they are proud of.
Procedures
Students attending the school were invited to participate in the online questionnaire during regular class time. The researcher visited every class at least twice and was given time at the start of class during “circle time” to talk to students about the research and provide the information needed to allow students to make an informed decision about their participation. Staff members were present and involved in asking questions of the researcher that they felt students might have been wondering but not confident to ask. Prior to visiting the classes, a letter describing the research was sent to the parents of all students. The questionnaire was open to all students currently enrolled at the school, and staff (primarily teachers) were provided with the link to the questionnaire to distribute to students who were absent on the days the researcher made the class visits. The questionnaire was completed by students over two terms in the second half of 2012.
The questionnaire contained 60 items and took students approximately 20-30 minutes to complete. The length of completion time depended on the time taken to answer open-ended questions and the number of questions to which they chose to respond. The questionnaire was developed in partnership with the school principal and contained open-ended and fixed questions that covered areas including students’ experiences with mainstream education and with their current school, their families’ involvement with the school and the students’ education, perceptions of their teachers, parental education levels, perceived outcomes, and their future goals and aspirations. The open-ended questions provided students an opportunity to describe and explain their responses, eliciting more in-depth data and allowing for a richer understanding of the students’ experiences to emerge.
This paper reported on students’ responses to the following items from the questionnaire: Why did you leave your last school? Why did you want to go to this school? What do you like about this school? And, what are the three main things you like about your teachers at this school? These were all open-ended questions to which students were given unlimited space to respond. Most students wrote sentences or short paragraphs in response. Responses were hand-coded using an inductive, open-coding technique (Cohen, Manion & Morrison, 2011). The project was approved by the La Trobe University Human Ethics Committee and the Department of Education and Early Childhood (DEECD) Ethics Committee.
4. Results
Participants
Sixty-two students completed the questionnaire, representing 35% of students enrolled at the school at that time. Of all students (n=79) who were present in class at the time the researcher visited, 78% completed the questionnaire. The results presented therefore are considered to be a good representation of the students who are engaged with the school.
Table One shows the demographic characteristics of students who completed the questionnaire. The average age of students was 17. There were roughly equal numbers of male and female students (around 50% male and 50% female). The majority of students identified as Anglo-Australian background (n=23, 37%) while 8% of students (n=5) were Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander. (n=20, 32%, left this answer blank). Twenty students (32%) were living in single-parent households, 17 (27%) lived in two-parent households, and seven (11%) students were not living with either parent.
Reasons for disengagement from previous school
Sixty students (97%) answered the question “Why did you leave your last school?” The response options to this question were open ended. Overall, these responses revealed an overwhelming sense of students not feeling listened to by staff and feeling let down by a lack of support from teachers.
“Because the teachers didn’t help me, they ignored me” (Male, 19)
The responses indicated that students responded to a lack of support or a sense of not being “heard“ by their teachers through negative behaviour, which ultimately led to them being asked to leave the school or to become withdrawn and stop attending.
“I left my last school because the teachers didn’t teach you anything or help you with anything ... I just didn’t see the point going there anymore” (Male, 18)
While lack of support was the most commonly mentioned reason for leaving their last school, some students also mentioned bullying, being asked to leave/expelled, and behavioural issues. These were often mentioned in a context of feeling that they did not receive support from teachers when these experiences occurred.
“The teachers did not care about me and I used to get bullied and the school did nothing” (Female, 17)
“I was falling behind and was not receiving any help from my teachers to catch up again” (Male, 19)
Reengagement of students in education
Students were asked “Why did you want to go to this school?” Fifty-eight students wrote open-ended responses to this question. The most common reasons cited regarding the appeal of the school model related to what they knew about the school structure and culture (including flexible class times, small class sizes, the school culture, the teachers), while others identified more personal reasons such as the school being the only one that would take them.
The staff were mentioned by eight (12%) of students as a reason for enrolling. A number of students recalled their first pre-enrollment meeting with the teachers and the way that they were treated by staff as a reason that they wanted to attend the school. Other students did not refer directly to this meeting, but spoke more generally about the teachers (although it is important to note that the students often did not differentiate between the well-being and teaching staff, referring to all staff as teachers). In particular, students placed importance on the way that the staff speak to them, that they make them feel welcome and supported, and that they are “easy going.”
“Because I hadn’t been to school for too long and the teachers were very welcoming when I came in with a friend one day and asked me if I was in school and they told me I could come to (school) and they would put me in quickly” (Female, 18)
“Because they don’t tell you what to do they ask you and the teachers are the best” (Male, 16)
What students like about the school
Fifty-eight students (94%) responded to the question “What do you like about this school?” The teachers/staff were the most commonly mentioned aspect of the school that students liked. Thirty-six students (58%) mentioned the teachers. Additionally, nine students (15%) said “Everything.” Students also mentioned the school culture, class sizes, class times/hours, resources such as food and excursions, other students and the individualized approach to learning.
“Everything. The teachers, the staff, the principal. Everything. Excursions - they pay for them for you. You make new friends every year. Good electives” (Female, 19)
The availability of support and the willingness of teachers to help students when they need it, regardless of learning disabilities or other issues, was mentioned the most often, by fourteen students (39%).
“I like that I can bring my baby boy to school with me. I like that they can accommodate that I have a child with me, and I like that they help every person with any learning difficulty” (Female, 15)
“The teachers are easy to get along with and it’s like a second home. It’s also relaxing to kick back and do our work, the teachers help us to do our work if we need help unlike some other schools they don’t listen to what we have to say and they don’t put the effort to help us”(Female, 15)
Reference to the staff member’s personal characteristics included words such as friendly, encouraging, understanding, nice, wonderful, and great. Students also mentioned the way that the staff and the school provided an environment that is warm, supportive, welcoming, and safe both physically and emotionally. They described the teachers being mates or like family, and that the school felt like a second home.
“They love to get to know you & don’t judge you about anything and try fix your bad way into being good & your good ways into being better” (Male, 16)
What students like about their teachers
Fifty-seven students (92%) provided responses to the question “What are the three main things you like about your teachers?” The overarching theme that emerged was the support and care provided to students based on their individual needs. This was in regard to both their educational and personal needs. Being supportive, caring, and helpful was mentioned the most often by students. Students also referred to the ways in which teachers work with them—providing help, giving them space, and giving them work that was suited to their abilities—and how they showed support and care in various ways, including getting to know each student personally and catering to their needs.
“They take the time to get to know you and your faults and work around them” (Male, 16)
“Compassionate - one teacher helped me get my learners permit. She was much kinder than an average teacher” (Female, 18)
Respectful interactions and feeling understood and listened to were also of particular importance to students. Comments that indicated this included “They don’t yell,” “You never get put down when being late or making a mistake,” “They help explain the work so people understand it,” and “They don’t push you into anything that you don’t wanna do.”
Equality in relationships emerged as a key theme in these responses. Many students acknowledged the sense of friendship and family that they felt at school. They valued the effort that staff made to get to know them, to have fun with them, and to show that they genuinely care for and respect them.
“They treat us like adults” (Male, 17)
“They have the time to listen to me and they are my friends not just my teachers” (Male, 16)
“That they’re my mates. They have time to listen to our problems and will never give up trying on us” (Male, 15)
5. Scholarly significance of the study
As expected, and consistent with the literature, the findings from this study demonstrated that staff-student relationships were important to students both in terms of their reasons for leaving their previous schools and in terms of supporting their academic and personal development at the school involved in the study. With respect to the reasons why students left their previous school, students’ responses indicated that they often felt misunderstood, as though they were disliked or didn’t fit in, or that no-one cared about them. A number of students recounted that they felt teachers did not care or respond when they were bullied or if they fell behind academically. Students indicated a sense of disappointment and abandonment in not being heard or supported by teachers, and for many students this ultimately led to them either being asked to leave, or disengaging through non-attendance. Alongside this, many students made direct reference to staff in their reasons for the study school having appeal, including feeling as though they could talk to staff and that the staff cared about what was going on with them. These findings suggested that the school model, which included an explicit focus on developing SSRs, was an effective means of engaging these students in education—clearly, their relationship with school staff was a large part of the school’s appeal and helped these students to feel connected to the school.
The demographic profile of students involved in this study indicated that many are likely to be at risk of becoming disengaged from mainstream education. Many students were socio-economically disadvantaged, and a number had mental health or drug and alcohol concerns. While it was beyond the scope of this study to compare the experiences of these students to those from more advantaged homes, the findings of this study indicated that these students did struggle in a mainstream school environment and that their relationships with teachers was implicated in this. The sense that students felt disliked or un-noticed in large schools, or let down by teachers in the mainstream system, was clear in the responses. As identified in the literature, positive SSRs can play a crucial role for disadvantaged students in enabling them to cope in a mainstream school environment.
There are several limitations to this study that should be noted. First, the data collected were from one school only. Data also did not reflect the experiences of students who may not be as engaged in the study school, as those who do not attend regularly were unlikely to participate. Future research would benefit from a recruitment approach that targets students who are not regularly attending class.

It is a great game to watch in terms of talent.
It is a bit sloppy, but great to watch these young guys play.
Wiggins looks good when not forcing 3s, Bennett looks great too. I like the looks of Parker as well.
Also Delly has also become one of my favourite players to watch. He just does all the hard things and is a great leaker out there.
Very good game so far and a great bonus to see the two top picks this year battling it out. Bennett looks sharper than last season already and the Greek Freak is always fun to watch.
One thing that just occured to me, I wonder how much Jason Kidd will be able to improve the Greek Freak's point skills when he really gets working with him. With his insane length and great skillset already, Kidd could turn him into the next Mr Triple Double.
Charlotte 1st rounders giving him a run for his money. Vonleh 0-13 and PJ Hairston is 2-16. 2-29 combined. I liked the picks and they were well praised but these are two of the poorest shooting performances since Bennett last year. Good to see a fellow Canadian bounce back. I'm sure Charlootes picks come back stronger and just a bad game.
I thought both Parker and Wiggins looked good. I think Jabari needs a bit more conditioning but overall he played really good. Wiggins has to get a bit bigger but to my surprise he played good as well. The future of the NBA is ver bright with up and coming players like these two...
I honestly think Giannis has more potential than Wiggins or Jabari. Dude has a solid handle, is a great playmaker for his size, can shoot, is crazy athetlic and obviously defensively has the tools to guard guys like KD and Paul George. Probably has a lower floor too than both though.
Giannis is only a few months older than wiggins and parker, so they are basically the same age. I think he is as good of a prospect as both of them. I didn't realize he was that good. You pretty much said it. He can shoot, be a playmaker and is going to be a great defender. The Bucks have a very bright future with him and Parker. He was bringing the ball up the court at 6-11 and being 19 and he looked pretty comfortable doing it. He definately has it like Parker and Wiggins, it will be great watching them grow as players. Also I think I just became a Bucks fan to go along with being a Twolves fan now.
I like the fact has a ton of confidence. It seemed to me he thought he was the best player on the floor. Milwaukee should be in position to do better but still should have a top pick next year. If they could get mudialy(spelt the wrong I'm sure) they would be in good shape going forward.
The Cavs could have 4 top picks in their starting line up on opening night, that would be some sort I reckon I'd think.
Vonleh had a nightmare shooting game but I'm not judging him on 30 minutes play, he's very much a prospect and his main role may be on defence initially. The Hornets ( have to remember to type this on not Bobcats) can work on his shooting with him, they have Pat Ewing one of the best scoring big men ever as an Assistant Coach who I'd think would be an ideal man to work one to one with Vonleh. Don't forget that Vonleh is still only 18 so he can be used sparingly during his rookie year if needs be to allow time to refine his game. Coach Clifford has worked worked with numerous top big men down the years so can spend time with him, Al Jefferson can be a good mentor and MJ can always pass on a few shooting tips if needed.
I'm certainly looking forward to seeing Jabari Parker and the Greek Freak in tandem this coming year and as PaulsJayhawks says above if the Bucks happened to land someone like Mudiay next summer that would be a great trio going forward.
I hate to talk about players landing on a team a year in advance but Mudiay after having defence drilled into him y Coach Larry Brown for a year to then have Jason Kidd to oversee his NBA career wold be a perfect fit for him.
Fun game going on right now between Bucks and Cavs. Wiggins is looking pretty good with 18 points in 23 minutes. Parker, Bennett, and the Freak are also making solid impressions.Happy Monday everyone! Another Weekly Update post. I hope you all enjoyed my St. Thomas and St. John pictures in my weekly update post from last week. Also, don’t forget to check out my sister’s blog, FITnancials, that I am helping run (she is the writer).
I also have a $399 cash or tablet giveaway that will be up on my blog later today. Please come back and check that out!
Didn’t do a whole ton this past weekend. Time flew by and we wasted a lot of time relaxing. Should have been more productive! Spent Saturday relaxing and at night watched Gangster Squad. It was good! Ryan Gosling definitely was just an added bonus in the movie
Then on Sunday spent about 5 hours looking for homy gym equipment, and then about 3 hours setting it all up.
2013 GOALS
I realized the other day that I didn’t make 2013 goals yet. Yes, I made my 2012 and 5 Year Review – So many GOOD things post but I didn’t actually list any goals for this year. So here we go:
1. Pay off ALL of my student loans.
My goal is to completely wipe out the $38,000 of student loans that I graduated with in August. I’ve been calculating it (yes, I do this all the time) and they are still on track to be completely gone by March or April of this year. April will be the latest and lets just hope that nothing changes and takes me off from this schedule.
2. Get super fit.
Now that we plan on having everything that we need to work out in our basement, we definitely should have no problem with working out and getting more toned. Me and W plan on making a workout schedule for ourselves and are super excited to see our results.
3. Save for a decent sized down payment.
We are about 75% positive that we want to buy a new house in 2014. I plan on making a new post on this soon. A lot of you have wondered why we want a new house and why we want to sell our current house. It’s probably all lifestyle inflation and in my head but I still want one.
4. Plan an awesome wedding!
We are most likely thinking Spring of 2014 and last month I posted some wedding ideas. Of course there’s a long list of things that need to be done, and I’ve done pretty much nothing
Spending:
We did spend some money in the past week, but some of it was from bonus money that W earned. He gets a bonus card from the car brand he sells, and it’s all deposited on a debit card. Now, this is different from his monthly “salesman of the month” bonus that he’s been earning (that is all direct deposited into our bank account). It’s all extra money so we decided to spend some money on ourselves and have some fun.
And we did spend a lot of other money, which you can see below in my “being healthy” section below.
Extra Income (does not include salary from our jobs):
I did good last week, but I am expecting the next couple of weeks to be better. I’m waiting on a couple of payments and I have some things scheduled for the next couple of weeks. Lets just hope nothing falls through! I made $940 in extra income last week.
Food:
No meal plan again for this week. We didn’t do the greatest with eating in last week, mainly because of laziness. We do have a well stocked fridge, I just need to cook some dinners before everything goes bad!
Being healthy:
I haven’t been doing the greatest with this. We did buy a home gym yesterday (pictured above), which was SUPER expensive. I did not realize how much everything would be just so that W could lift some weights. The olympic bar alone was $320 (tax included) and that doesn’t include any of the weights which were super expensive too ($150 for the two 45 pound weights).
We are still looking for a treadmill. We saw a couple yesterday but I wanted to do a little research on them. It needs to be reliable and good for 3 people to use every day. What brand/type of treadmill do you have? Let me know!
Great job again on the income! I had a fairly good week myself, which is good to see. The working out…not so much.
Yup same here!
My recent post $940 in Extra Income, Life Updates and 2013 Goals
Research the treadmill. Some a just garbage. Get one that is sturdy.

Yeah that's what I'm afraid of. Definitely need something that can be reliable for 3 people.

Good idea to get the wedding planning out of the way early, it takes forever. And I'm so impressed with all the extra income. Looks like you'll have no problem reaching your 2013 goals. I would love to hear more about your workout goals. I found having a firm wedding date to be extremely motivating on that front!

I don't know if it's too late, but did you look at places like Play It Again Sports for gym equipment? The brand new stuff is definitely super expensive, but it's not like barbells wear out, so the used stuff is usually just as good.

Ha funny that you say that because my ex-boss (I still talk to them) actually owns a PIAS! We ended up not going there though because the prices were similar to buying new.

Great job again! We scored a sweet deal on a treadmill a few years ago (I think it was 2200 on for 750). It's a Horizon Etrak and we really like it. It has a small built in fan and speakers to hook up your iPod/mp3 player which is sort of nice. Like I said we're a few years in and still like it.
Will definitely look into this! Thanks!
"I also have a $399 cash or tablet giveaway that will be up on my blog later today" – Looking forward to this! My wife and I have been entering a lot of giveaways recently so we will definitely enter this one.
Your home gym is freaking awesome. It's definitely a goal of mine to have one someday. I would love to have that weight setup that you have, as well as a treadmill. I have been working out 5x/week and using our cruise in February as a motivator.
I hope you reach your goal of paying off your student loans. When we have more savings I will consider putting more towards our student loans….would be nice to get them down to a more manageable amount.
My recent post How to Save Money on a Date
ooh yay! It's probably the same giveaway haha.
And thanks! We definitely love the home gym.
Totally jealous of your home gym! I'm very lucky that I have a treadmill at work plus my fiance's sister is letting me use hers whenever I want, otherwise staying healthy would be tough! The extra income has sure taken a nose dive this month, I don't know what it is but I haven't been able to close ANY ad deals – even though my stats are better and my price is the same. Weird. Oh well though, I'm not going to fuss too much about it.
Thanks! And hope your extra income increases soon. I think most people have seen a decrease.
Extra.income has been slow this month but hopefully it picks up this week!
I have been using the Wii fit a.couple times a week which is better than no exercise!
Lance at Money Life and More recently posted..What Did I Do With My Raise in 2013?
I hope it picks up!
Good luck with your new home gym! I that most people buy those things and get excited about it, then it ends up sitting in a dusty garage or basement not being used. An idea is (because you said it was expensive), track your workouts as if you were going to an expensive gym. Each time you work out it "goes towards" what it cost to buy that that thing. That way it keeps you motivated because you know at least you are making that purchase worthwhile, and eventually the idea is you worked out so much, the thing paid for itself and then some because you actually used it! Make sense?
My recent post Leaving There
Makes sense! I am pretty positive that we will use it though. The main reason why we stopped going to the gym was because it was too far. Spending an hour each day to commute to the gym wasn't worth it for us.
Wow, a home gym! I would love one of those, especially a treadmill.
Do you have a location in mind yet for your wedding?
My recent post What Happened to My Allowance?
Haha we are not sure. I've called a couple of places though
Awesome gym! Have you looked into Craigslist or other online options to help you fill out the rest of the items without spending too much?
My recent post Yes, My Boyfriend is Paying Me Rent
We kind of look at craigslist but didn't see anything we really liked. Will have to look for a treadmill on there though!
such a good post! love your blog as always, so smart! i want to find a treadmill too!
My recent post weekends go too fast
Thanks!
Awesome job on the extra income! I bought a Smith Machine a couple years back (on Black Friday) and got an awesome deal on it. I can't believe the weights you bought were that expensive though. I bought a set of 300 Lbs. including the bar for $150 brand new. We bought a treadmill this past weekend also. We bought a little heavier duty one that can hold 325 Lbs with a 2.5 continuous HP motor. I think it was the ProForm 790T. It had pretty good reviews and was relatively easy to put together.
Yeah W wanted the best material and brands, and he wanted the weights to be rubber so that they wouldn't crack the floor. Ugh so expensive! It was the cheapest price we found for what we wanted though.
And we were looking into the ProForm! How much did you spend?
It was $699 for the one we got. So far I like it. Makes sense about the weights. I have those foam mats underneath all my exercise equipment so it doesn't matter if I drop them. They should last him the rest of his life though so its not a bad investment.
That's a good deal! I'll have to look into that.
And yeah, we have the foam mats, but I we still wanted to be extra safe (and get the rubber weights) since some of his friends lift like 600 pounds and if they dropped the bar, I would prefer to not have to kill them! haha
My recent post Tablet Time: Nexus 10 OR $399 (Winner’s Choice) Giveaway
You are kicking some major tush with that extra income. That simply is awesome! Also I think it is great that you and W can motivate each other to tone up and stick to a vigorous workout routine together. And if the equipment is expensive, it will be well worth the investment if it is also well used!
Thanks Jennifer! I'm glad that no one is tearing me apart for buying it.

I know I blogged about it ages ago when I first saw the pattern within the Crochet Today magazine which was just wow and totally stuck out to me. It was something I wanted to keep and to make for myself, for my magic day and to keep as a memory of it.
The finished orginal article is meant to look something like this;
Its made in two halves with pineapple and a million trebles and chains but its a really easy pattern to follow even though to do a row seems to take forever due to its width. I'm making mine with some free wool, my mam gave it to me months ago because she had no use to it so, seeing its free its even more great [seeing we're working with a £2000 budget to get married with]. We're planning an autumnal wedding so this shawl is going to be the perfect way to keep a little warmth.
It needs pulling into shape a lot and some of the chains are a bit iffy - not sure if its the yarn or me but it's fine.

Oops!
Error...Essential oils may not always be so essential, say fragrant Davy philosophers
Laura Slattery
“Welcome to the world of flavour and fragrance,” a new Davy Research report on the flavour and fragrance (F&F) industry boldly opens. Written by John O’Reilly, Jack Gorman and Aiden O’Donnell, it’s easily my new favourite stockbroker research report – a heady mix of financial metrics and the philosophy of sensory pleasure.
First, the history bit. Over the last 20 years, the F&F sector has thrived as consumers smelled the bath salts, wrapped their tongues around flavour extracts and sought out those top notes with an enthusiasm that, while not unique in history, “has never before been so dominant, at least as far as so many people are concerned”, Davy argues.
“Nothing exemplifies this more than how the human body, as regards every sensory experience, has commanded centre stage as the means to self-awareness, gratification, emotional and psychological well-being, self-expression, self-creation, identity and personal happiness.
“It has been narcissism writ large.”
(I’m a Clinique Happy Heart woman myself.)
“In the long historical contest… between stoicism (indifference to pleasure) and hedonism (that satisfying wants and the pleasure attainable is the only good), hedonism has been the recent winner,” says Davy. Its report goes on to discuss the ideal conditions for fragrantly rampant consumerism, and how these may variously relate to Romanticism, the Industrial Revolution and a scene from Marcel Proust’s In Search of Lost Time, before reaching the more grimly prosaic austerity versus stimulus economic debate of our times.
“A regime of austerity will only endure if the belief system around it changes,” Davy observes. In other words, make-do-and-mend resignation won’t last unless we really, really believe in it. But if we do believe in it… then that has consequences for flavour and fragrance manufacturers like Givaudan (top shareholder: the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation), Naturex, Robertet, Frutarom and Symrise.
These F&F houses fulfil the “here comes the science” role that L’Oréal used to talk about, buying raw materials like vanilla, menthol, sandalwood and citrus and transforming them into the chemical cocktails that make up shampoos, balms, perfumes, gels and detergents for consumer product companies – which then do the easy part and sell the stuff to us weak hedonists.
Bicarbonate of soda is an effective cleaning agent, the report notes, but it lacks the sensory attraction of a fragranced alternative. This is why it is so hard to purchase a clothes detergent that has not been jazzed up with the smell of fresh mountain air or sea shore driftwood – “as if these could ever really be put in a package”. The irony is that with so much olfactory bombardment, our sensory neurons get a bit tired. Because everything smells, nothing much smells – or at least not in a way that stimulates us.
This might not be a problem for much longer. If austerity overturns the existing order, then it’s curtains – in the West, at least – for what Davy calls “the excesses of a buy/discard/buy culture”. The “marketing bias towards engendering personal dissatisfaction” may have to be re-pitched; the “demand for novelty in sensory experience” will falter. The stockbroking house forecasts that industrial sensory experiences may well “be of lesser significance” in future, at least in the developed world.
Or as it puts it: “The long-run contest between the stoics and the hedonists may enter a new phase.”
So those essential oils might not be so essential any more. And that’s not great in an industry where new products can account for around 20 per cent of sales. Happily, Davy remains positive about the fundamentals of the sector – praise the lord of ylang-ylang for those developing markets.

Daniel Epstein visited the last Walk the Talk Show to discuss his “intentionally unintentional” curriculum at the Unreasonable Institute. Quite simply—there is no curriculum. Instead, the Unreasonable Institute brings the entrepreneurs together to learn from a group of wildly brilliant and talented mentors—including our own Waylon Lewis—as well as from each other. They also connect the entrepreneurs with investors to help make their visions reality.
In this segment, Daniel Epstein explains the Unreasonable mission and shares stories of a few of last year’s entrepreneurs:

Humanitarians had organized a flotilla to sail to Gaza from Mediterranean ports on the anniversary of last yearâ€™s attempt – an attempt which resulted in the death of nine people as Israel committed a barbaric act of piracy against the Turkish ship, Mavi Marmara. The Los Angeles area was privileged to hear two first hand accounts of this yearâ€™s flotilla thanks to a presentation titled: â€œEyewitness Account of the Gaza Flotillaâ€ held this past weekend. Featured speakers were Yonatan Shapira and Mary Hughes Thompson. Mr. Shapira is from Israel and is a former Israeli IDF pilot. He is a Refusenik, a member of Boycott from Within, and a co founder of Combatants for Peace. Ms Thompson is a veteran peace activist and a co founder of the Free Gaza Movement. She was on board one of the two ships that sailed simultaneously into the port of Gaza to break the decades long blockade in the late summer of 2008. The event was one in a series of conversations about the Middle East and was sponsored by Jewish Voices for Peace (JVP); the Levantine Cultural Center; LA Jews for Peace (LAJP); Friends of Sabeel; Women in Black LA (WIBLA), and BDSLA. Mr. Shapira began by giving his background as a child growing up in a privileged position in Israel, the son of a high ranking Air Force officer. He told the audience that the squad which dropped Israeli soldiers onto the Mavi Marmara in 2010 was his squad. He told of being disillusioned by Israeli targeted assassination attempts which killed innocent civilians, including children. He addressed the audience and asked if there were persons present who held a point of view different than his. Two people raised their hands. â€œI want to hear what you have to say after the presentationâ€ said Mr. Shapira Mr Shapira said that he was on the American Gaza bound ship, The Audacity of Hope. He and others arrived in Athens at the end of June and immediately began training in non violent resistance.The ship was not permitted to leave Athens because of bogus claims that the vessel was not seaworthy. There were representatives of the press on board including CNN, the New York Times, and the Nation. Thanks to the heavy hand of Israeli and American pressure on the government of Greece, the voyage was aborted. The ship was confiscated, and attorneys are still working for its release. Mr. Shapira had been on a small â€œJewish vesselâ€ which tried to sail to Gaza shortly after the incident of Israeli piracy on the Mavi Marmara. The vessel carried harmonicas and was stopped by the Israeli navy. Israel claimed that the vessel carried dual use items. Mr. Shapira said that even if the voyage to the port of Gaza had been successful, success cannot truly be declared until Gaza is free. Ms Thompson told briefly of her work with the people of Palestine. She chose to take the Canadian boat, Tahrir because of ties that she has to Canada. At first she had planned to skip the voyage but then thought of all the brave people who were going, and she felt she had to make another statement for her cause – the cause of Palestine. She rendezvoused with the Tahrir on the island of Crete where she also underwent training in nonviolent resistance. Israeli journalist Amira Hass was on board the Tahrir. Ms Thompson spoke of the support of the Greek people for their cause. The Greek navy insisted on seeing every detail of paperwork. They declared the boat un seaworthy because, among other things, the beds were too narrow, and the air conditioning did not work. When the handwriting was on the wall, the passengers found five men on board who were familiar with maritime engineering. The captain of the Tahrir was a Greek citizen and left the boat fearing arrest. He first instructed the five men in the techniques they would need to sail the vessel. Then the ship took off. Two people got into kayaks to create interference. The boat was physically prevented from sailing far, and soon the Tahrir were boarded. The boarding party found the wheel house empty and when the passengers were asked who the captain was, everyone raised his or her hand. Ms Thompson mentioned the large amount of goods confiscated by Israel from the vessels of the first flotilla – cell phones, cameras, computers and other equipment. This material was never returned. This information brought a gasp from the audience. â€œI never thought of thatâ€ said one woman â€œthat adds the element of theft.â€ Ms Thompson and Mr. Shapira agreed that the publicity the flotilla received and the light that was shown on Gaza and the conditions of the Gazans under the boot of Israel, rendered the mission of the Flotilla II at least partially successful. When non violence is a tactic, then the value of public opinion becomes increasingly valuable.

FIRST ROW
Backsplash tile is a great place to bring in earthy browns and greens; the jewel-like sheen of the tile updates the color choice. Mixing wood textures and finishes for your cabinets and countertops can also be an interesting way to adorn your kitchen in earthy colors, especially when the grain and character of the wood is emphasized.
SECOND ROW
We also like brown with a preppy twist—in a bamboo-print fabric curtain, for example, or striped with candy pink. Rusty orange tile looks retro and fun in an older kitchen. If you want to go lighter, sage green and buttery yellow, mixed with rough-cut blond wood, has a serene organic feel. And lastly, if you like the idea of earth tones in the kitchen but aren’t ready for a big renovation, throw in an accent, like pillows or a blanket on adjacent seating.

Americans turning a blind eye to vision lossAmericans turning a blind eye to vision loss
(NAPS)-More than two thirds of Americans aged 55 or older have had an eye exam in the last year to maintain their vision, yet 80 percent do not know that age-related macular degeneration, or AMD, is a leading cause of vision loss in people over 60, according to a new national survey. The survey, conducted by Opinion Research Corporation, found that only 46 percent of the 1,169 respondents could correctly identify the risk factors for this serious, progressive eye disease and just half could identify any one symptom. Of the 24 percent who are familiar with AMD, only 31 percent were aware that treatment options exist for the disease.
AMD occurs when the macula-the central portion of the retina that is important for reading and color vision-becomes damaged. There are two forms of AMD-wet and dry. All cases begin as the dry form, but 10 percent to 15 percent progress to the more serious wet form, which can result in sudden and severe central vision loss. Without treatment, central vision can be lost over time, leaving only peripheral, or side, vision.
In its early stages, AMD may not cause any noticeable symptoms. As the disease advances, symptoms may occur in one eye or both, and can include blurred vision, difficulty reading or recognizing faces, blind spots developing in the middle of the field of vision, colors becoming hard to distinguish and distortion causing edges or lines to appear wavy, according to research by the AMD Alliance and the University of Michigan Kellogg Eye Center.
If a person develops any of these symptoms, an eye exam is crucial and early diagnosis and treatment is essential to help avoid severe vision loss. A retina specialist should be consulted if there is a diagnosis of wet AMD, to ensure the most appropriate care.
Approximately 15 million people in the United States have AMD, and more than 1.7 million Americans have the advanced form of the disease. About 200,000 new cases of wet AMD are diagnosed each year in North America. Due to the aging baby boomer population, the National Eye Institute estimates that the prevalence of advanced AMD will grow to nearly 3 million by 2020.
The greatest risk factor for AMD is age. Other risk factors include gender (women tend to be at greater risk), race (Caucasians are more likely to lose vision from AMD) and family history. Living a healthy lifestyle can help reduce the risk of developing AMD. Several risk factors can be managed with your healthcare provider's help, including obesity and smoking.

Another Great JobCharlize Theron: Marriage Isn't Important to Me
By Kelly Fisher Posted Jun 29th 2011 05:50PM
In a new interview on CNN's 'Piers Morgan Tonight,' the Oscar-winning actress discussed her stance on gay marriage and revealed that she doesn't see marriage in her future.
"I'll be the first to say, here on your show, marriage -- before I felt this way about [marriage equality] -- was never something that was important to me. I don't know the exact reason for that," Theron said.
"Some would say because I came from a very troubled marriage," she said. "My parents did not have a good marriage, but I don't think it's that."
Calling the ability to get hitched a "divine right," Theron talks about the government's role in deciding who people can and can't love.
"When government starts to tell us who can love and what is good love, whether government or a government built on a certain religion, I do have a problem with that," she said. "If you want to bring it back to the politics...I do have a problem with the fact that our government hasn't stepped up enough to make this federal, to make [gay marriage] legal."
Theron, who split from longtime boyfriend Stuart Townsend in January, says she'll be happy just having a meaningful relationship with someone.
"I really want for myself a long-term relationship, and I have been in long-term relationships...That's the kind of union that I want," she said. "The actual ceremony is not something that is important to me -- but I see the importance for other people."
In 2009, Theron appeared on 'The View' to discuss her views on gay marriage.
"I don't want to get married because right now the institution of marriage feels very one-sided, and I want to live in a country where we all have equal rights," Theron said at the time, adding, "I have so many friends who are gays and lesbians who would so badly want to get married, that I wouldn't be able to sleep with myself."
Filed under:
- Movie News-
- Politics-
- Videos just don't believe in the "if my friends can't do it speech than neither will I". I understand taking a stand for what you believe in, I think it is very important to express that, I just disagree that hypothetically speaking if you met someone in which you would like to marry and if the federal laws did not change than you would not marry that person. I don't think its fair for you or your gay lesbian friends and someone from G.L.A.D should step up to the plate and just also promote that we don't find it necessary for everyone else to put their lives on hold waiting for the federal government makes gay marriage legal. The institution of marriage is not one sided. Charlize, I would rather you just say I don't want to get married at this time because I am not seeing anyone or pull the George Clooney and admit that you will just never get married.
The issue that has everyone so disturbed with Gay/Lesbians is the fact that how they have intimate relationships. People just find it offensive. I'm not trying to be mean or cruel but that is the bottom line. Two people of the same gender being intimate. That is the issue, people are offended by it. There are some states in which Gay/Lesbian marriages are legal. Things are progessing and moving one step at a time. This is a difficult situation for every to jump on the band wagon and give it a green light.

Marriage sucks!! People can say what they want but half the couples I know are in a "business" not a marriage. Once you get married everything changes. I have been married before and as soon as the honeymoon was over he changed. I will never get married again and hate that everyone thinks that marriage is so important. Not everyone is marriage material..maybe I'm not. I know that it is not for me. I like being single and get sick of people thinking that all single women are lonely. I am alone, not lonely. There is a big difference.
Reply
You're absolutely right, Lisa. I am a divorced male, have been for 27 years. I also enjoy being single & am use to people looking at me strangely when I dine alone. Being married doesn't insure happiness. I believe that successful relationships are built by developing a strong friendship first. As they say, live the life you love and love the life you live
What's so hot about marriage? 80 percent of all males cheat on their wives. The divorce rate is about 50 Percent. I'm an old fashion girl who would love to believe in marriage but when i look around me...and take a look at most marriages..it doesn't seem so hot. Maybe if folks would wait till they were really grown up before marriage that would help.

Senate investigators accuse engine-maker Caterpillar of hiding $8 billion in Swiss tax havens
U.S. Senate investigators have accused heavy equipment giant Caterpillar of hiding $8 billion in profits offshore in Switzerland to avoid U.S. taxes.
In a report released late Monday, investigators said the company took advantage of a special corporate tax deal negotiated with Swiss authorities that allowed it to defer or avoid paying $2.4 billion in US taxes.
The report, released by Senator Carl Levin, chairman of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, said the company instead only had to pay Swiss authorities $55 million under the strategy.
“That tax strategy depends on the company making the case that its parts business is run out of Switzerland instead of the U.S. so it can justify sending 85 percent or more of the parts profits to Geneva,” Levin said in a statement.
Caterpillar executives will face questions in a hearing by the committee on Tuesday, following similar probes into tax avoidance by U.S. giants like Apple and Microsoft.
The investigation says the Peoria, Illinois-based company, with $56 billion in sales last year, used to book its sales of parts around the world — mostly made in the U.S. — on its U.S. tax report.
But beginning in 1999 it shifted at least 85 percent of its parts sales profits to Switzerland.
“Caterpillar accomplished that profit shift without making any real changes in its business operations,” the report said, noting the parts business was still run from the United States.
In a statement ahead of the hearing, Caterpillar’s vice president for financial services Julie Lagacy said the company complies with US tax laws.
“Caterpillar takes very seriously its obligation to follow tax law and pay what it owes,” said Lagacy.
“In fact, Caterpillar’s effective income tax rate averages about 29 percent, which is one of the highest for a U.S. multinational manufacturing company.”

Ev.
“We’ve been overwhelmed by the reaction of fans and at radio,” The Cold Stares’ Chris Tapp said. “Truthfully, it took off so quickly, it caught us a bit off guard. Radio seems to really be hungry for guitar-oriented music.” Tapp continues, “We’re extremely proud of our new album, and this grassroots support validates our hard work. The album with Mark has been a long time coming, and we are very excited to share it soon.” The Cold Stares will be on a promotional radio tour throughout August 2014.
“Think Queens of the Stone Age meets Zeppelin meets John Lee Hooker…This is blues-rock for the 21st century,” said Vintage Guitar. Since 2008, duo of Chris Tapp (vocals, guitar) and Brian Mullins (drums) have been performing to packed clubs. “The first time I saw them,” Nashville’s Lightening 100 radio personality Dan Buckley said, “I thought they had at least two other musicians secretly behind the curtain. There’s just no way that sound comes from the two of them.”
The Huffington Post’s Radley Balko said of their live show, “Everyone in the room will have the same realization…the first time they see The Cold Stares live: These guys are better than the band you came to see.”

That came as no surprise to me. I have always thought of Lady Antebellum as way more pop than country. "Own the Night' is far stronger album than "Need You Now," which broke the trio big time. But the former disc has so little country on it.
Rucker is more on the soulful side of country, of course, while the husband-wife duo of Thompson Square rock more.
What's most telling from the McLennan review were the covers. That's something that has struck me also about artists. If playing rock covers, that's a damn good indication of what they're really about musically. So many of today's artists do that, instead of perhaps an old country gem or covering folks like Haggard (he seems to be an artist that is covered by those who are looking for a country oldie). Somehow it seems enough to lyrically name check Haggard, Jones or Jennings to prove your country cred. (Erich Church goes a slightly different route by naming a song after Springsteen).
McLennan pulls no punches in assessing the three acts - " They also pose a serious threat to country music." He wrote of the concert, ."
McLennan cited Lady A's covers - Honky Tonk Women (now if they played Country Tonk...), Midnight Rider from the Allmans with the help of Thompson Square and the Doobies' Black Water with Rucker.
McLennan indicated the results were not pretty: "in each case, the songs were gutted and served as arm-waving singalongs."
Rucker was not much different, covering Steve Miller and Prince in his segment. As for Thompson Square, Kiss and Led Zeppelin were reference points.
Obviously these acts and everyone else (that includes everyone from Garth Brooks, who sounds way way more traditional than most acts today, to Rascal Flatts to Tim McGraw) will sing and play whatever they want. It's just seems too bad that when they're getting more than happy to get played on country radio, they pay zero to their forebears, who helped put them where they are.Jay-Z Is Rapping to Marina Abramovic at Pace Gallery By Leigh Silver 0 0 Watch Now Tags: Lists, News, Jay Z, Marina Abramovic, Performance Art, Art & Design Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. blog comments powered by Disqus Stay connected with complex Style Latest Trending Stories Load More StoriesA couple of years into Jerry Brown's first governorship Dow Chemical Co. abandoned plans to build a $500 million petrochemical plant, citing regulatory red tape.
A half-billion dollars was serious money in those days, the equivalent of perhaps $5 billion today, and Brown's critics quickly laid the blame at his door.
"He -carbon sources that will raise utility costs and embraced cap-and-trade emission controls that will exact billions of dollars in fees from business.
But he's also criticized CEQA, signed by his predecessor, Ronald Reagan, as a "blob," called for streamlining its procedures and quipped, "I've never seen a CEQA exemption that I don't like."
This week, while on a trade mission to China, he continued to beat the drums for regulatory reform.
"We've got more damn laws than you can think of," Brown told one gathering, adding that there are "endless ideas" about adding more regulation and he sees his job as "to find a way to cut through that."
"To the extent you have any red tape, there's no one more anxious to reduce it," Brown told an appreciative group of business people.
So does Brown really want to lower regulatory hurdles or is it just a convenient and momentary posture? With Brown, one never knows.

There are reasons why preppers should consider an investment in additional soil for their gardens. The soil that some preppers are using for their gardens, for example, might be an inferior soil, such as clay. Also, their soil might be worn out after several growing seasons.
If either of these soil conditions apply, preppers can save money by buying their soil by the trailer load. Also, if preppers buy soil from stores, they could buy the soil in the off season when it is cheaper. Then, preppers would store the soil until spring.
Preppers should water their gardens at least once a day. If they can water their gardens twice a day, their results will be even better. Around sunrise and sunset are the best times to water their gardens. If it rains, nature has saved preppers some time and water. If water is scarce, rain barrels could help to collect water for gardens.
Preppers should check their gardens each day for insect infestation. The faster that preppers treat their gardens to get rid of the insect pests, the less damage these insects will be able to do, and the easier it will be to get rid of these insects. If the insect pests are too well established in preppers’ tomato crops, for example, preppers might have to harvest their tomatoes while they are still green and unaffected by the infestation of the red tomatos. Then, preppers will be dining on fried green tomatoes.
Wild animals, such as rabbits, also can be a problem for preppers’ gardens. Preppers can protect their gardens from such pests with products such as rabbit fences.
Some of the many advantages of gardens include the:
- Maintenance of good physical health and agility.
- Pleasure of making things grow.
- Good feelings of partial food independence.
- Bonding that neighbors can establish by trading food from each others’ gardens.
- Education that prepper’s children receive when they better understand how food is grown.

It is based on high academic standards and high achievement for all students and advancement of its graduates into higher education and high-wage, flexible career paths. Students can take academic and technical courses that apply to their learning in real–life situations, preparing them for future technical training and careers. Plus, they are able to earn up to 18 hours of college credit in some of their high school courses at no cost by meeting the grade requirements and mastering course competencies as agreed upon by ASU-Beebe and the school districts.
When the student graduates from high school, he/she enters the next phase of the program at ASU-Beebe (with campuses at Beebe, Searcy, Heber Springs, and LRAFB), where he/she continues with a general and technical education. At ASU-Beebe, the student will concentrate on the specifics of his/her chosen technical career and graduate with an Associate of Applied Science, an Associate of Arts (transfer), or with a technical certificate.
The collaboration between high schools and ASU-Beebe adds up to an exciting opportunity to prepare students for a lifetime of learning while encouraging post-secondary education through articulated credit. This also shortens the time required and lessens the expense of the student's college education.
At this time, ASU-Beebe has articulation agreements with high schools in several counties and with several area technical centers. Some of the majors to which students may apply articulated credit include: Business Technology, Computer Aided Drafting and Design, Computer Systems Technology, Early Childhood Education, Medical Records Technology, General Technology, and Welding Technology. Technical certificate programs are also available for articulated credit.
How do I get credit?
What is Articulated Credit?
Articulated credit starts with an articulation agreement between a high school and college to provide the students an opportunity to earn college credit while still in high school. Articulated credit is designed to save the student time, effort, and expense.
The College and Career Links student must take a sequence of courses that meet the requirements agreed upon by the high school and ASU-Beebe. Those courses are taught at the high school by a high school teacher. This allows students to progress to the post-secondary level without duplicating coursework taken in high school. The earned credit is held in "escrow" until the student completes one semester (minimum 12 hours) at ASU-Beebe and achieves a 2.0/4.0 GPA.
How can I get Articulated Credit?
The following conditions must be met:
The high school course must be passed with an overall grade of "B" or better and meet any stated requirements for the articulated credit.
The student must apply for admission to ASU-Beebe and complete a semester (minimum 12 hours) within 15 months of graduation.
The student must submit an Application for Articulated Credit and the credit will be posted to the ASU-Beebe transcript within the second semester.
Remember, the articulated credit is FREE.
A maximum of 18 credit hours can be articulated at ASU-Beebe.**
**Automotive Services Technology does allow more credit.
Information for Parents
Dear Parent(s)/Guardian:
Your son or daughter is enrolled in a class at their high school that may earn them college credit for their high school course – FREE! This opportunity is available to them through the College and Career Links program at ASU-Beebe.

First of all, so glad to have you back and writing! Second of all, you are always SO HARD ON YOURSELF! It's HARD to make friends, especially as an adult. There is no gene. It just takes luck, courage, and good timing. Please stop beating yourself up. Maybe next time, you will push yourself a bit more, but beating yourself up won't help. P.S. If I lived near you, I'd be your friend!
Well, uh, once again I find myself nodding and agreeing. I seem OK at making good online friends, but suck at doing it in person. We keep wanting to have people over to dinner...but that never seems to work out right. I want deep and meaningful friendships and I just have a dickens of a time making them, then keeping them if I make them. Sigh. I just keep being friendly and enjoying the people I meet briefly (I've been doing some software training, and the best part has been talking to the students on breaks).
I relate to this, too.
Adena is right. You are very hard on yourself. You're blaming yourself instead of taking the next small step forward.
For me -- every time I try to make plans with someone I want to get to know -- something comes up with the kid, and I have to cancel.
Am I supposed to wait until she's ten to have friends again?
FWIW, I often wish I lived near you and could invite you over to teach me to make challah or do some art.
first off...consider me one of those friends. i know, i know we live on opposite sides of the country, but hey friends are friends.
second off...don't be so stinking hard on yourself. your a wonderful person, and like adena said it is hard to make friends as an adult.
if it means anything, i have tons of "friends" associates, but when it comes down to it, all my real "friends" are family members who live far. i have no one to go to chick flicks with, no one over for dinner, and no mutual friends with kids to have play dates and such.
but all in all, its okay. my husband has 0 friends. 0, none, nothing, no one besides me and the kids. and thats the way he likes it. he never tries, thinks about or considers the idea of friends.
its okay...some of us are "friends" people and some of us are not. i don't know where i fit, because in the end i rarely let many people in...i prefer "associates" and those few friends i have...let me count....1 or maybe 2, who are not family members, i.e. my sister, mama, grandma, cousin...are guys. my closest relationships are always with guys. i can hang with a "dude" from here to eternity...but in the end...i love being at home couped up with something creative in my hands and mind.
your a beautiful person...and i promise you there is nothing wrong with you. at all. period.
You know, I thought about you and this post all day. I like what kiandra says, too. She conveyed her real connection to you -- despite the miles. I feel that with you, too.
When you have been in the library, you've been there with your kids. I'm sure it would have been much harder to break away from that and try to establish a different level of connection with the librarian.
Also, I empathize with your sadness. This part of motherhood is the hardest for me. I miss my friendships. I miss the flexibility I had to meet up with kindred spirits.
Same boat as you. It is so hard to make friends as adults. I try to live by the motto to have no regrets and expect rejection sometimes. It takes some guts to ask someone to have coffee only to hear how busy they are, they'd love to but... It takes a while to get a good connection with someone but when you do, it will be worth it. Hang in there. I consider you one of my online friends!Nintendo Download: 8th May (North America)
Posted by Thomas Whitehead downloads. Let's get to it.
If you missed the European Nintendo Download news earlier this week, don't sweat it — the details are right here.
Wii U Virtual Console
Wario Land 4 (Nintendo, $7.99) —. We'll dash into this one again, but in the meantime you can check out our glowing recommendation in our 3DS Ambassador Programme Wario Land 4 review.
Wii U eShop Temporary Discount
Trine 2: Director's Cut (Frozenbyte, $9.99 until 29th May, normally $19.99)
3DS eShop
The Denpa Men 3: The Rise of the Digitoll (Genius Sonority, $9.
Grinsia (Nicalis, $9.99) — This is a release sure to excite RPG fans, as Kemco's JRPG has a style reminiscent of 16-bit classics and looks set to deliver a suitably dramatic storyline. Nicalis has handled this port from the iOS / Android original, promising better controls, dual screen support and a “SNES–tastic” soundtrack. We'll dive into the adventure and bring you a review.
Parking Star 3D (CIRCLE Entertainment, $2.99) — This isn't the first game based on parking cars, nor may it be the last, with this one taking you to five cities and 40 'maps' as you try to avoid any nasty scratches to your paint. We'll check our mirrors and bring you a review.
3DS Virtual Console
Mega Man II (Capcom, $TBC) — The "Mega May" celebration continues with this second entry that graced the Game Boy. There's time travel, an accompanying Rush and a stranger called Quint; we'll see how this one holds up in our review.
Mega Man III (Capcom, $TBC) — We're going in sequence, and this time Dr. Wily is trying to drill down to the centre of the Earth, as you team up with Rush and "walking suitcase" Flip-Top to foil the villain's evil plan. We'll let you know what we think.
3DS eShop Demos
The Denpa Men 3: The Rise of the Digitoll (Genius Sonority, free)
Gardening Mama 2: Forest Friends (Majesco, free)
3DS eShop Temporary Discounts
Murder on the Titanic (Joindots, available at a discount until 22nd May)
Jewel Match 3 (Joindots, available at a discount until 22nd May)
3D Games Collection (Joindots, available at a discount until 22nd May)
Aqua Moto Racing 3D (Zordix, $4.50 until 29th May, normally $5.99)
3DS eShop Retail Download Discounts
Etrian Odyssey Untold: The Millennium Girl (Atlus, on discount between 12th May and 19th May)
Etrian Odyssey IV: Legends of the Titan (Atlus, on discount between 12th May and 19th May)
DSiWare
Sokomania 2: Cool Job (Cinemax, 200 Nintendo Points) — This sequel is the final DSiWare title from Cinemax, though we weren't big fans of its predecessor. Nevertheless, the 100+ Sokoban puzzles in this one may deliver some fun for very few Nintendo Points, so we'll start pushing some blocks and puzzle out a review.
Jewel Match (Joindots, 500 Nintendo Points) — DSiWare forever! Match 3 forever! It's a genre that will always be with us, and this one promises 150 levels and multiplayer support; we'll let you know what we think.
Jewel Quest 4 Heritage (Tulip Games, 800 Nintendo Points) — It's a Match 3 DSiWare face-off, possibly to the death. Tulip Games has opted to release the DSiWare version of this (there is a 3DS eShop version in Europe, too), though we weren't impressed in our Jewel Quest 4 Heritage review.
Plenty to choose from, North America. Let us know what you're planning to pick up in the poll and comments below.

jjmesa16 said:
I really like Wario Land 4 but I'm not sure I want to pay $8 for it since I have it on my gameboy advance. So I think I'll just stick with the demos this week.

woo denpa dudes 3 woo rise of toll booth woo must download

I will get Grinsia and Jewel Match. Waiting for Sokomania 2 review. Jewel Match 3 was fantastic so thats while I am getting JM (Jewel Match)

I always held off on getting Trine 2 because of the steep price. I think I'll finally get it
#9
PanurgeJr said:
Eventually I'll check out Grinsia (unless reviews say it's the same as the Android version), but I haven't even bought Yumi yet and I've been defaulting for some time now, so I won't be downloading anything new for a bit.
#10
Spoony_Tech said:
Total missed Grinsia otherwise I might've voted for that. Didn't even realize it was out this week. I just might wait for a review though as I know I'll like Denpamen 3. Just won't get around to playing it anytime soon.
#11
sinalefa said:
@TreesenHauser
I almost did too, but demos don't hurt. Plus I would like to know the price of the EO games. And read the review for Parking Star.
#12
HeroOfCybertron said:
I'm getting both Mega Man games and maybe Grinsia.
#13
Tsurii897 said:
@Luigifan141 the DS VC didn't even start yet and you're already asking for the next thing? Way to go...

I'll wait for that Grinsia review first, might get a MM game, though

XFsWorld said:
Trine 2 is like the game with the most discounts.
#16
rjejr said:
I'ld like to applaud Genius Sonority for having a demo for all 3 Denpa Men games right at launch. Going to surprise my kid ad go download the demo now. He's still busy w/ Triple Deluxe but he'll enjoy piddling about w/ the demo for a bit.

0utburst said:
At least it's not volleyball for NA.
#18
XCWarrior said:
There are so many games in a lot of different genres, and yet STILL over 40% of you are saying, "nothing."
You want more games to be released on 3DS and WiiU in the future guys? You actually have to buy something now and then.
#19
SphericalCrusher said:
@Ash_Anne It's good! Glad to see it on 3DS.

Zemus-DJ said:
Grinsia, the denpamen 3, both MM. Pretty good week for me

I would buy grinsia but denpa dudes 3 doh

I'm surprised to see a GBA game on here considering how Europe never got one... instead they got VolleyBall for some reason...
#24
Oto said:
Great to see some love for Denpa men. Dl'd the demo for 2 & couldn't put it down. Def picking up 3
#25
biglittlejake said:
Still waiting for Minish Cap to come to NA. It has an IGN page so it seems as though it will. Hopefully they start releasing N64 and GC games. More so the 64 I wonder when and if Legend of Zelda Ocarina and Majoras Mask will be available to download. Maybe this time around if they do 64 we will get the good ones they didn't put out like Harvest Moon 64, Banjo Kazooie games, and while they're at it Star Wars Pod Racer. Those are what I am wishing Nintendo will do. If Nintendo did stuff like that more Wii U's would sell.
#26
CaviarMeths said:
I don't know why Trine 2 isn't just on permanent discount. Seems to be on discount every month anyway, and I doubt it really has many sales at full price. I paid $8 for it and it's a decent game at that price. I'd feel ripped off at 20.
Will wait for a review for Grinsia. Nothing else for me this week.
#27
Shy_Guy said:
Nothing for me again.. Still waiting for Mario Kart
#28
Laxiom said:
@XCWarrior generally, I share this opinion. When it's all said and done, dollars is what matters to companies.
But this week was a very poor week. And a shining example of why I have no faith in Nintendo's handling of the VC. I could rant,.. But at this point I don't think it's nessisary.
I've danced this dance with the Wii, and I'm seeing all the same moves with the U.
I will be downloading Mario kart 8 at launch and buying several copies of Smash, so there's that.
#29
bezerker99 said:
No Castlevania III means this week is fail.
#30
Giygas_95 said:
I'm tempted to download Wario Land 4 just so I can read the part in the manual about Wario getting pooped on by a pigeon. XD
I'm counting down the days till Mega Man V and Xtreme 2!
#31
LztheQuack said:
I believe Volleyball already came out in America
#32
absuplendous said:
@XCWarrior Then they have to put out something I want. That might happen if they don't insist on releasing ONE Virtual Console title a week. Nintendo is sitting on a treasure trove of classics; there's little reason to dole them out piecemeal. Wario Land 4 is a nice selection this time, but when your only Virtual Console offering is something like Clu Clu Land, the potential of the Virtual Console is being wasted.
#33
LztheQuack said:
At the same time, if they release a bunch of titles at once, then there will be nothing for several weeks. Then everyone will complain about there being nothing new
#34
Mike1 said:
I'm thrilled about Mega Man 2 and 3!!!
#35
User1988 said:
Wow, that's a pretty long list this week. I'm getting the Denpamen at 9 sharp this morning!
#36
PJR0cks said:
maybe I should get Trine 2, the review on here was just okay, but it has a great metacritic score and people I asked seem to like it.
#37
Webby-sama said:
Uh, nothing. I'm waiting for the first Denpa Men to go on sale so I can dive into the series beyond the demos. Grinsia is gonna just end up being an impulse buy whenever it happens.
#38
Lalivero said:
@Tsurii897 Does it really matter though when the VC doesn't have much going for it anyways? I mean barely anything has been done about the backlog that could've been already there and ready(and then systems like N64 don't have much representation as it is...), yet we get GBA?
After this first trickle of GBA games that they spread out, seems very likely that those, too, will slow down like everything else, yet...we have DS games(of all things) coming at some point as well?
The VC is a bit of a mess atm so, with GameCube being one of the last N consoles left to count, might as well throw it in with things to look forward to as well(at least so far without more remakes announced).
@PJR0cks It is a nice game.
#39
Luigifan141 said:
@Anojan12345 @Tsurii897 lol, I forgot that the DS Virtual Console was even going to happen. I'm very optimistic about that as well!
Also, the N64 is my favorite console, so VC support for it once again would be fantastic. Same with GB, GBC, TurboGrafix-16, NeoGeo, Genesis, Saturn, Dreamcast... The list could go on for miles.
It's kind of disappointing that you two had to shoot down my comment and handle it negatively, though. DS VC support should come first, but there are lots of other consoles that should get supported. The GameCube is the one that I'm the most excited about, though.

LztheQuack said:
@Kodeen And when Nintendo is out (there aren't THAT many 1st party titles), then what?
#41
Ryno said:
@ThomasBW84: Minor thing I noticed, but on the Wario Land 4 page
3DS eShop Release Date:
19th Nov 2001 (USA)
17th Nov 2001 (UK/EU)
21st Aug 2001 (JPN)
Don't think the 3DS or the eShop was around in 2001.
#42
ultraraichu said:
Interesting week. I would download The Denpa Men 3 but I still haven't beat 1 and yet to buy 2. So that's on my wishlist for now.
#43
ThomasBW84 said:
@Ryno Indeed
Those are the GBA release dates, though I don't know why they were listed under 3DS eShop. Should be fixed now.
#44
Lalivero said:
@Unca_Lz Well it's not really exciting or new to see titles that have already rereleased a million times, so we'll have to deal with the 'nothing new' complaints anyways as they continue to work with the remainder of the already existing VC. :x
I can see why something like GBA would trickle over time at the start(since it is newer to the VC) but as for what we have previously gotten? :-/
Fortunately, by next gen, this shouldn't be an issue(with the whole integration thing going on and it 'absorbing' what the Wii U has to offer).

Grinsia for me. I thought battle networks was coming out, but I'll take grinsia, that looks like a good one

JustinH said:
Three DSi games and one Wii U game? Brutal week. Why couldn't Scram Kitty or Armillo come out today?
#50
sleepinglion said:
After a stellar VC April it's another week with ONE Wii U VC title.
Thanks, Nintendo.
#51
JCnator said:
Looks like I'm going to download Wario Land 4 to my Wii U today. As a 3DS Ambassador, I'm not particularly fond of the way the 3DS system emulated GBA games due of its excessive motion blurring.
#52
RickyWill said:
WE NEED A WARIO LAND GAME FOR WII U
#53
AVahne said:
Still nothing.
On another note, $10 is a lot for Grinsia. I think I'll stick with the Android version.
#54
redivgamer90 said:
Denpa Men 3! FINALLY!!! I've waited for so long, but now it's finally here!
It's also good to see that the DSi is still getting a handful of games, but I wish the wii ware or virtual console on wii could get more games...
#55
TheBigK said:
Eh, the only game here that interests me is Wario Land 4, and I already have that on 3DS. Perhaps next week.
#56
unrandomsam said:
@Unca_Lz When they run out introduce a new console. They should never be in a situation where they are running out of games.
#57
Capt_N said:
@XCWarrior: I agree with @Laxiom, & you, that money is what will make Nintendo churn out more, in theory at least. However, I am not made of cash, so what money I do have, I prioritize what I want, even though there are many games(both retail, & d/l) that i want. Right now, I am patiently saving for Shantae And The Pirates' Curse(SAtPC). If something, including temporary discounts, comes up in the shop that I want more, then I will get it. Otherwise, I will wait, if it is something that I want, though not as highly.
@JCnator: Motion blurring would occur using the GBP(Game Boy Player) on the GCN(Gamecube), if the player sets the screen filter to "low", or whatever the setting was. Since I am not a 3ds Ambassador, I don't know the extent you mean, but I imagine it is similar to the GBP. As such, it is entirely possible part of the 3DS GBA emulator was built similar to the GBP.

Slim pickings but its nice to see Capcom continue to release Mega Man games on VC.

Lucky for you American's. Wish we got GameBoy Versions of Mega Man 2 and 3 here in Europe.
#60
Tasuki said:
Kinda on the fence with Warioland 4. I played the first one but really didn't enjoy it that much.
@Gingardreadman: If you have played them before you wouldn't want those 2. They are considered by many to be the worst of the GB Megaman games.

MyBodyIsReggie said:
Something about playing Game Boy titles on the Wii U just feels wrong.
Perhaps, it's because playing them on the 3DS feels so right.
#78
JCnator said:
@Capt_N My GBA games from 3DS is noticeably blurrier in motion than my Game Boy Player's Soft Filter. When the former's video is in motion, it gets as detailed as if I half-shut my eyes. GBP's Soft Filtering on the video is much less blurry in comparison, to the point I can still spot the finer details of the picture.
The thing is, GBA emulation on 3DS is kinda rushed compared to Wii U's VC. Functional Sleep Mode available on certain games but isn't triggered by simply closing the 3DS, darker coloring, no Restore Point, no Suspend Point and being unable to go back on HOME Menu without closing the software. The other VC games available on 3DS don't have these problems.
#79
DreamOn said:
@Steamboat_Willie They most certainly do. Especially if you appreciate pixel art. These are Nintendos best emulated games yet. All of Nintendos VC games need to have pixel perfect mode from now on as well as scanned game booklets.
#80
sevex said:
@vamkar It's extremely weird... I don't remember liking it nearly as much as the previous Wario Land games.

DreamOn said:
@vamkar It's an amazing platformer. I find it a real underrated gem.

They should make 3D classics megaman games.But as awesome as that would be,i don't see it happening.

Dr_Corndog said:
I'd jump all over Wario Land 4 if I didn't have a GBA and eBay didn't exist. Although, I'm tempted to get Super Mario World for the off-TV play despite owning a SNES cart.
#84
DreamOn said:
@JCnator I have deleted and banished my ambassador GBA games and am redownloading them all on Wii U because the quality is night and day in my opinion.
GBA by M2 for Wii U VC is the best retro thing Nintendo has ever done. Never been so happy about VC till now.
#85
Dr_Corndog said:
Those GB Mega Man games are hard to come by in physical form, excepting the first one, though. And Mega Man V on the GB is supposed to be one of the best in the whole series.
#86
Mr-X9000 said:
when are they going to put gba games on 3ds
#87
Capt_N said:
@JCnator: Sounds similar to the Wii's N64, & Nes emulation quality, that darkened-colors part anyway. The emulation sounds a little sub-par. I wonder why Nintendo added motion blur, since a real GBA never had it, as far as I've always seen on my GBA, & GBA SP. Strange.
#88
ricklongo said:
@ThomasBW84 Slightly off-topic, but do you guys plan on reviewing Stick it to the Man?
#89
unrandomsam said:
@Dr_Corndog Thing is without Super Gameboy support then it is less desirable.
@WiiULoveGBA The Wii VC Neo Geo is pretty great connected to a CRT at least for the smaller early games. Only problem is you can only have Svideo/60hz or RGB/50hz. The sound is absolutely spot on. All the scanlines are in the right places. The 320x240 ones suffer with bits of tearing though or parts of the screen cut off. Metal Slug X lags like only Metal Slug 2 should (M2 fixed that on the PS3 by overclocking the emulator).
Is e.g Mario World bad just playing on the Gamepad (Does it use any awful filters or stretching ?)

Ash_Anne said:
@SphericalCrusher I hope so because I just bought it. I haven't had a chance to play it yet.

Will get both Mega Man games and Grinsia, which looks like a fun old-school JRPG (and it's only $2 more than the Android version).

theberrage said:
I've done nothing but complain about Wii U VC since they've only rereleased games from Wii. That said, having never played a game boy advance before, I have been very happy with the GBA games released. Admittedly, I was very skeptical about GBA released on WiiU. I have downloaded metroid fusion and yoshis island and they are both superb. I look forward to Wario 4 and more GBA games.
#100
Windy said:
One of the best open world RPG's available on 3ds is The Denpamen 2 its amazing more people aren't excited about The Denpamen 3 release. If your a fan of Dragon quest you will love the Denpamen. I know it looks funny but it is a solid Game folks. The price is cheap for such a quality game. In fact you can't get better quality at that price
#101
jariw said:
One week to go!
#102
sleepinglion said:
Nintendo eShop 'What's new this week': one title.
Sony's PSN Store 'What's new this week': a lot more than one.
Nintendo, I love you, but c'mon, man! Beef up the Virtual Console. With so many systems to draw from you could still chuck out five titles a week and never run out.
#103
IceClimbers said:
@absuplendous @sleepinglion So, why weren't you complaining back in April when the 3DS only received one VC title that entire month (and none in Europe)? Don't be biased in favor of the Wii U. Plus, Nintendo released 3 VC titles overall this week, across two systems. Great week.
#104
Yomerodes said:
@originaljohn
ATLUS have not a single game in the European eshop, everyone of their games have been localized there by other companies, and they decide when (and if) they are going to put them on sale. The first game ATLUS will release in Europe is Conception 2, this year.
#105
absuplendous said:
@IceClimbers A month ago, I was not yet a member of this site. Had I been, I may have complained then too, though I don't make a point of complaining each and every week the Virtual Console offering is a letdown. Nowhere in my comment did I favor the Wii U; I did not mention either platform by name. This was intentional, meant to apply to the Virtual Console on all platforms.
#106
joey302 said:
I can see that Nintendo after the GBA launch is back to the same old one vc game per week crap!! Japan already has Mario kart,5 pc engine games like Bonk n Gradius and 8 or 9 square soft snes titles!!! What the hell is the deal/problem???? I don't get it at all!! And SEGA where are you??? Need some Genesis love!! You stink Reggie!!
#107
sleepinglion said:
@joey302 I hear ya. Nintendo either doesn't listen or just doesn't care. Comparing the Wii's VC to the Wii U effort is depressing. With proof that they are capable of Genesis, TG-16, Neo-Geo, N64, SNES, NES, Arcade, heck, even Commodore 64 titles it's mega sad to see what the Wii U VC is doing these days. I bring it up in my Club Nintendo surveys so at least I feel like I'm doing something.

@IceClimbers Because I really don't care much about the state of the 3DS VC. If I'm biased it is because I already feel like I have a TON of games to choose from when it comes to my 3DS. It's the Wii U that suffers from regular gaming drought and is capable of emulating more consoles. Kind of you to ask, but that's why I don't voice concern about the 3DS. It gets plenty of eShop updates.

@sleepinglion dude I rag about it in every survey I do!! It's ridiculous! I find it incredible that a company as big as Nintendo can only muster out one vc game a week!! And then they wonder why wii u isn't selling! And why no indie games this week?? How long are those 15-20 indie games gonna be on Nintendo's website showing "TBD" as a release date!! THERE'S NOTHING IN THE STORES AS IT IS!!

sleepinglion said:
@joey302 The situation isn't good but it kinda helps to know other fans like you feel my pain. I have a lot of older retro consoles in great working condition, but not all gamers are so lucky. New fans and folks who no longer have their old machines shouldn't have to look to emulation in order to enjoy the rich catalog Nintendo COULD be putting out there. The argument could be made that maybe the VC isn't that profitable. I would say it's hard to compete with FREE emulation if you're charging 8 bucks for an SNES title. In a perfect Virtual Console world the prices would be fair and the selection would be grand.

I tidied. I didn't clean. Why? Because it's scary, that's why. And I was left with this. Until finally yesterday, I couldn't take it anymore. I began the hours-long, post-Christmas cleanup.
I got lots of good advice.
Do it at night, they said. That way it's quicker, your kids aren't messing things up as soon as you straighten them, and there are no fights about which toys we are giving away.
Excellent plan, but I'd never do it. My kids don't go to bed until 10 p.m. and when I finally lay their sweet, annoying little heads down on those pillows, I am not cleaning. I am done for the day.
Have them help you pick out old toys they don't want anymore to give away, they said.
Fantastic idea. Teach them sharing and charity. They're not going to miss the toys once they're gone, right? Only they do. My children have the uncanny ability to miss something that has been knowingly given away, I think, just to mess with me. The musical seahorse they got when they were three months old? Suddenly at three and a half, they want to listen to his lullabyes again. Why? Because I gave him away six months ago, and they remembered yesterday, as we went through their toys again.
That doll they never played with once? Well, wouldn't you know they were going to start playing with it tomorrow?
Even pieces of toy sets for infants, like a little ladybug with a mirror on the bottom that had long lost its mobile. They were using it, dammit, mom!
It's not a one-time remembrance, either. I think my children have a built-in Excel spreadsheet containing every toy they've ever owned. Sometimes they'll even ask me to bring back their cribs. Why? Because they're theirs.
Anyway, three hours later, the girls had played with every old ball, every random action figure, every car, every Barbie and every piece of plastic fruit in our house. I had a white trash bag of trash, and a white trash bag of giveaways. I had to promise Lilly I wasn't going to throw them out, but simply store them. Because she really needed the old popped-out bubble wrap from two years ago, she swore.
I was cranky and tired and irritable. The house now looked like this:
Boy, it looks almost the same, doesn't it? It looks like it should have taken me 30 minutes, not three hours, right? No, I agree with you. It's certainly not what I was expecting when I started the task. I thought it would take an hour and be...cleaner, somehow.
This is what I was talking about yesterday. But I know my plight well enough to still feel a sense of accomplishment about this. It was hard work, and I did it.
And it lasted until 7 a.m. this morning, when they woke up. I think that's a record.

On an average week I don’t really see my husband too much. He works outside the house while I work from the home. The added thing here is that both of us would attach the label “workaholic” to our personality traits and work habits, even outside of “work” and into our family time.
I guess it’s a good thing that we both have the same work ethic and desire to continually grow, but when it comes to carving out time for each other, it can be tricky. I wish I could say it was generally only on the weekends, but the truth is … we really don’t spend a lot of time together when we’re not focusing our attention on other things as well.
When the kids go to bed, I use that time to either catch up on some housework or to work for the many freelance jobs I am juggling and the husband gets to work (again) on either work training/education or one of the many work-hobbies he has. Many times we do this in the same room, but really it’s not the same.
There has been a lot of news about celebrities breaking up and separating and getting divorced. I have seen a few friends go through the same thing and I would be lying if I said I never worry about it touching our relationship.
We have been married for 8 years now, together for 12 years, and we have three kids but stranger things have happened, and divorces seem to pop up out of nowhere. Sure, I am not in their relationship so I can’t know for sure what is going on behind the scenes, but I want to make sure I am doing what I can to sort of “divorce proof” our marriage, if you can do that… I don’t know.
My husband and I have a good relationship and I wouldn’t say there are any dark clouds above our heads or skeletons in our closet, but I do think that if we increased our quality time together, it would do us a world of good.
I don’t remember the last evening (or honestly even 2 hours) where we just hung out— no computer, no work, no smart phone … just each other. I don’t even know if I could do that and I know that is the big indicator that we should be doing that!

By LAURA BEACH
Published: November 24, 2002
THERE are places in rural Connecticut so rich in history that unearthing the past, as Stanley Moroch discovered, is literally only a matter of digging.
Last April, at an 18th-century burying ground in Colchester, Mr. Moroch spotted what appeared to be a tombstone in some freshly plowed earth near a weed-covered mound.
''When I turned the fragment over I discovered that it was part of a marble plaque,'' Mr. Moroch, the town's historian, said.
A second and third piece of finely chiseled stone emerged, along with the inscription: ''The Tomb of Gershom Bulkeley and His Descendants.''
The discovery touched off an inquiry and led to the excavation of a site many villagers said they believed had been a makeshift winter morgue.
The project will culminate next spring, nearly a year to the day after work began, when at least 28 members of one of Connecticut's most illustrious families will be reburied in the long-lost crypt, which is known to date to about 1790.
Arthur Liverant, a local antiquarian who had known of the vault's existence, but not of its contents, said: ''My father told me that kids broke into the tomb as a prank in 1933. They were ordered down to the cemetery the next day to cover it up with dirt.''
Upon learning the news of the tomb's rediscovery, Mr. Liverant said his first call was to Peter Bulkeley.
''I was there within an hour,'' said Mr. Bulkeley of Old Saybrook, who knew that several members of his family were buried at the Colchester cemetery, but was unaware of the tomb's existence.
Mr. Bulkeley's grandfather, Morgan Gardner Bulkeley, was governor of the state from 1889 to 1893. His great-grandfather, Eliphalet Adams Bulkeley, founded the Aetna Life Insurance Company in Hartford in 1853. (Both men are buried at Cedar Hills Cemetery in Hartford.)
Restoration of the Colchester Burying Ground, where 19 Bulkeley grave sites exist, first began in 1991 with money provided by the Bulkeley Family Fund.
As for the finding last spring, Mr. Bulkeley said he had no qualms about entering the tomb where Gershom Bulkeley, a prosperous farmer, slave owner, soldier and legislator born in Colchester in 1708 was interred with his wife, Abigail Robbins Bulkeley, and at least four of his eight children.
''Dr. Nicholas F. Bellantoni, the Connecticut state archaeologist, said that this was something that should be done for historical and archaeological reasons,'' Mr. Bulkeley said. ''I completely agreed.''
Dr. Bellantoni, a University of Connecticut professor who advises 169 municipalities on archaeological sites, said, ''If the medical examiner determines that the remains are 50 years old or more and represent an unmarked burial, I'm called in.''
Dr. Bellantoni called the Colchester project ''a resurrection.''
''Here are people who are anonymous,'' he said. ''They're gone, lost. When this project is done, we will put them back in the tomb and say something about their lives. These people will tell us their story.''
Assisted by students and volunteers, Dr. Bellantoni began digging in Colchester in late May and concluded the job Aug. 22.
David Cooke, an amateur archaeologist from Rocky Hill, coordinated the efforts of the volunteers, who spent nearly 1,200 hours sorting, bagging and recording information.
''Because of its size, this is the most spectacular project that the volunteers have worked on,'' said Mike Raber, president of Friends of the Office of State Archaeology, an East Hartford group.
On June 18, the crew got its first look at the tomb's interior. Debris was strewn from one end of the vault to the other. Bones mingled indiscriminately with the remnants of nearly 30 coffins, which had originally been stacked on a series of brick partitions, built to a height of several feet. Water had seeped in through cracks in the domed ceiling, hastening the decay.
''It was an absolute mess,'' Dr. Bellantoni said. ''Coffins on both sides had collapsed on the center aisle. I knew almost immediately that we were up against 30 or more burials. We were facing a monumental task.''
At the southeast corner of the vault, lids and bottoms were stacked on top of one another, probably a mid-19th century attempt by family members to tidy up.
The coffin lids, made of a costly imported hardwood, turned out to be the researchers' Rosetta stone. Most were decorated with brass tacks that spelled out the deceased's initials, age and year of death. In some instances, the details were enclosed within hearts, a decorative flourish that Dr. Bellantoni had seen at only one other Connecticut burial at a grave dated 1818 in Cornwall.
The first lid to be carried from the tomb was marked ''JB/AE 4/1804.'' Consulting an enormous family tree, Mr. Bulkeley identified it as having contained the body of a toddler, Jerusha Bulkeley, Gershom's great-granddaughter.
As fragments of dozens of lids emerged over the next 10 weeks, Susan Bulkeley Daly, a direct descendant who lives in Warwick, R.I., helped compile a detailed profile of the four generations of family members who were interred in the crypt before it was sealed, probably around 1840.
''The most remarkable thing I saw was the number of old people buried in the tomb,'' Dr. Albert B. Harper said.
Dr. Harper, the director of the Henry Lee Institute for Forensic Science at the University of New Haven, and his students visited the site, studying bones for clues to the age, sex, health and racial ancestry of the crypt's occupants, all of whom were of European descent.
One person, unidentified but thought to have been a child, was found in a zinc-lined coffin. After the team had documented every stratum and removed the evidence to Dr. Bellantoni's laboratory in Storrs, the solitary coffin was returned unopened to the spotless vault.
''For every hour in the field you put eight hours in the lab,'' Dr. Bellantoni said.
This winter, with the help of students and colleagues, he will sort through the evidence, a trove of information on everything from 18th-century mortuary practices to occupational specialization.
Dr. Bellantoni, who is interested in genetic variability, planned to compare the DNA of living family members against that of their ancestors.
Despite their wealth, the Bulkeleys were buried with few belongings. In fact, other than coffin hardware, the only manufactured items found in the tomb were a few textile samples, the soles of a child's boots, a metal comb, a Staffordshire pottery plate and a cast-iron gate finial. The team recovered two porcelain teeth fitted to metal plates, sophisticated dental appliances for 1810.
A mason recently restored the tomb's brickwork to its 18th-century appearance. A plaque with engraved names will be placed near the entrance.
Come spring, when a blanket of periwinkles blossoms on the soft mound where weeds once grew, the Bulkeley family will gather at the tomb for a memorial.
''This project was an important way for me to get to know people I can't go back in time to meet,'' Ms. Daly said.''I want my children to know as much as they can about their heritage.''

Supporters of the non-profit gathered at Allen Unique Autos for the annual community campaign kick-off event.
Science fiction is the theme for this year's fundraising efforts.
While it might seem scary to think about the work ahead, some giving corporations have already helped take a big bite out of the total figure.
"We raised 450,133 dollars which is a great start of our campaign goal of 1.1 million," said Jerome Gonzales campaign co-chair.
Officials say fewer corporations participated as Pacesetters this year, so raising 41% of the United Way's 1.1 million dollar goal, is a good start.

Miu : "Since your birthday is tomorrow I thought I might as well give you your present today" (not her exact words.. lol!).
Fatin : "Yaayyy!!" (my exact reaction.. :p). Maybe something from Burt's Bees? But I was misled..
Instead of opening to see what was in the bag I started a guessing game. Trust me do these things. My first guess: Lip Balm, since I lurv lip balms to the extent of ridiculousness *I can never have enough! ;)*. I was right! Next.. what brand??
Mui's 1st Clue: It's not sold in Malaysia and pretty packaging. Not until she said "Bling Bling" did I shrieked "JILL STUART!!!"
Miu's 2nd Clue: You went into the shop and liked something from there.. My finger pointed directly to the shop on my left, "L'OCCITANE!!!" She bought it some time in June!!

And what are the possible applications? Yeast two-hybrid systems make use of a fact that one can have an active transcription activator hold together by non-covalent bonds. In order to make such an activator, one fuses a (potential) interactor "A" to a sequence-specific DNA-binding domain [=DBD] (Gal4- or Lexa-derived) and another interactor ("B") to a polymerase-specific activation domain [=AD] (say, Gal4- or VP16-derived). By themselves DBD and AD do not interact. When co-expressed, these two fusions associate through their "A" and "B" modules and such heteromeric activator stimulates transcription from a reporter gene, preceded with TATA box and binding site(s) for the DBD. No interaction - no activation. LacZ is often used as a reporter. Can be used for mapping the interaction domains or library screenings. As for comprehensive analysis of possible applications, Stanley Fields and Roger Brent (among others) did a pretty good job comparing two-hybrid system(s) to other methods of protein-protein interactions analysis. I believe that there is even a monograph on the subject by the former, and a number of reviews. Fields, Brent, Golemis + Medline = references. Good luck.

Each source gives a snapshot of different aspects of the burden of asthma. Hospitalizations, emergency room visits, and deaths represent more severe health outcomes associated with asthma. Such outcomes may be the result of poor asthma management, lack of access to healthcare, and exposure to known triggers. While we can use survey data to estimate the number of people suffering from asthma attacks, we do not have data on exactly when, where, and how often individuals have asthma attacks.
The Tracking Network includes data on asthma hospitalizations which reflects more severe exacerbations. For more information about the limitations of these data, visit the Hospitalizations for Asthma indicator page
The asthma prevalence data used on the Tracking Network are obtained from the BRFSS. BRFSS data are self-reported and reflect the perceptions of respondents. Self-reported data have some limitations because respondents may have difficulty recalling events and understanding questions. Furthermore, cultural and language barriers and limited health knowledge can affect the quality of self-reported data.

Watch NowWASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Bush said Wednesday he is "deeply concerned" about Iraq, not that concerned about Osama bin Laden and plans to keep all options on the table -- including nuclear weapons -- to protect the United States from any attacks.
During his first formal news conference of the year, Bush said he is committed to modernizing the U.S. nuclear arsenal while reducing the number of nuclear warheads..
Bush also said he is "deeply concerned about Iraq and so should the American people" because that country is run by Saddam Hussein, a man who killed his own people with chemical weapons.
Bush said Hussein must have something to hide, otherwise he would allow international inspectors into his country to verify Baghdad is not building weapons of mass destruction.
"He is a problem, and we're going to deal with him. The first stage is to consult with our allies and friends, and that's exactly what we're doing," Bush said, pointing out that Vice President Dick Cheney is in the region this week for that purpose.
By contrast, Bush downplayed concern on the whereabouts of Osama bin Laden, saying the accused terrorist mastermind is on the run and "I truly am not that concerned about him."
Bush said that U.S. forces are "performing brilliantly" in rooting out bin Laden's al Qaeda fighters in Afghanistan.
"We are at war to keep the peace," Bush said, comparing the war on terrorism to World War II.
On the escalating violence in the Middle East, Bush said Palestinians and Israelis both would have to work to create the conditions so the security proposal known as the Tenet Plan could lead to implementation of the Mitchell process that could mean a political settlement.
Bush said he sent special envoy Anthony Zinni back to the region because he thinks the retired Marine Corps general can make progress in the peace process. But Bush criticized Israel for its military reaction to terrorist attacks.
"Frankly, it's not helpful what the Israelis have recently done in order to create conditions for peace. I understand someone trying to defend themselves and to fight terror, but the recent actions aren't helpful."
On domestic issues, Bush accused a few senators of "standing in the way of justice" for blocking the confirmation of his judicial nominees.
He pointed out that the Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to vote Thursday on the nomination of Charles Pickering to the United States Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit.
"Judge Pickering is a respected and well-qualified nominee who was unanimously confirmed 12 years ago to the district bench," Bush said in an opening statement. "I strongly urge his confirmation."
The president said lawmakers were ignoring their constitutional obligation to confirm nominees in a timely fashion and were turning the process into "ideological battles that delay justice and hurt our democracy."
Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle, D-South Dakota, has said he would not seek a confirmation vote by the full Senate if Pickering loses the Judiciary Committee vote.
Bush said those senators who would block the full Senate vote were seeking to "undermine the nominations of candidates who agree with my philosophy that judges should interpret the law, not try to make law from the bench."
Among the groups that have come out in opposition to Pickering's nomination are the National Abortion Rights Action League, National Association for the Advancement of Colored People of Mississippi, People for the American Way and the AFL-CIO labor unions..

AbstractArizona is home to 11 species of rattlesnakes. As rapidly growing Arizona communities move into formerly undeveloped landscapes, encounters between people and rattlesnakes increase. As a result, the management of nuisance snakes, or snakes found in areas where people do not want them, is increasingly important. Since 1994, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has conducted research on the behavior and ecology of nuisance rattlesnake in Arizona national park units. A decade of research provides important insights into rattlesnake behavior that can be used by national parks and communities to reduce rattlesnake-human conflicts.

While 2011 was clearly a challenging year, there is a lot to be positive about looking ahead. Economically, while buffeted by natural disasters and fiscal policy indecisiveness at home and a European sovereign debt crisis abroad, the U.S. economy was able to stave off economic stagnation in 2011 and is likely to continue to do so in 2012.
Housing statistics and the duration of the housing downturn to date indicate that 2012 may be the year we begin to turn the corner. In the summer of 2011, economic concerns peaked as the economy appeared to be on the brink of stagnation. Since the recession officially ended, this was a nadir for the economy as consumer confidence Data as of November 2011 plummeted, concern about a double-dip recession resurfaced, and fiscal policy indecisiveness reached its zenith. In the second half of the year, and heading into 2012, most major economic statistics are exhibiting an encouraging level of stability and positive, but weak, trends. Though the pace of growth is slow, it is to be expected in an economic recovery caused by a financial crisis.
Households are paying off their debts and at the same time accessing credit more easily. Surprisingly, households also added Home Equity Lines of Credit in the third quarter for the first time since the financial crisis began, which is a positive sign of access to liquidity that softens the impact of income shocks. A quarterly survey by the New York Federal Reserve Bank1 shows that total household debt continues to decline, but at a slowing pace. During 2012, households will need to find their equilibrium between household debt levels and consumption.
Consumer sentiment rebounded strongly in the latter part of 2011, posting a six-month high in December. While still low compared to pre-recession levels, this figure indicates an improving belief in the strength of the economy in 2012.
The labor market seems to be ever so slowly clawing its way toward recovery. In December, jobless claims were at their lowest level since 2008. The unemployment rate is proving stubbornly persistent and gains are often due to declines in the number of people participating in the labor force. The consensus is that unemployment will remain high in 2012 and that it will take a number of years to reduce the level significantly. Nonetheless, there has been consistent private sector job creation in the latter half of 2011. We can expect the persistence of unemployment to be a particularly contentious issue in the 2012 election year.
Housing is an industry with long business cycles. Typical regional housing recessions have taken anywhere from three to five years to find their bottom. The national housing recession has behaved similarly in that it has bounced along a bottom for the past two years. While prices are declining again to new lows, affordability is rising dramatically due to a combination of house price deflation along with rock-bottom mortgage interest rates. Adjusting for inflation, this has been a “lost decade for housing as prices are the same as at the beginning of the millennium.
The time is right in 2012 for prices to begin growing again and housing affordability will put a floor under any further significant declines in 2012. The spring and summer buying season in 2012 will be watched very closely for positive signs of demand.
Most housing statistics basically moved sideways in the latter part of 2011. Builder sentiment is improving ever so slowly, but remains at very low levels. Housing starts are also increasing, driven mostly by multifamily starts. Even single-family housing starts began increasing at the end of 2011. Both single family starts and permits rose at an annualized pace of 15 percent over the six months ending in November 2011. Existing home sales also started to trend upward at the end of 2011, and were 12 percent higher in November 2011 compared to January 2011.
Putting all of these statistics together indicates there is a very long way to go and that the housing market is likely to sustain these trends in 2012. While we cannot say with a high degree of certainty what 2012 has in store for us, indications based on the latter part of 2011 are that both the broad economy and the housing market are moving toward positive growth in 2012. However, some impediments do exist including slower global economic growth, a recession in Europe, and fiscal and political uncertainty in the U.S. Taking these facts and trends together, we are bullish on the prospect of improving economic performance in 2012 from!ConstancioBoliviaTransportation

-.How an interacting many-particle system prepared in an initial state which is far from equilibrium evolves in time, and how it thermalizes if at all, is an important and open question which is also of experimental relevance. In this talk I will consider a system of interacting bosons that are initially out of equilibrium due to an interaction quench. I will study the stability of this nonequilibrium system to a periodic potential, and in particular show that even though the system is isolated from the surroundings, it can act as its own reservoir, with a self-generated dissipation and an effective-temperature leading to quasi-thermal behavior at low frequencies and long wavelengths. I will also compare this with results for the steady state behavior of nonequilibrium and weakly interacting fermions.Be the first to like this

*Be a CREATOR and Storyteller. Take, edit, and share YOUR pictures and stories!*
My kickoff: 1. WE have the tools and social networks to CREATE and connect/share our stories with others. 2. Our brains are set up largely to process visuals over text.
So, why are we as educators largely consumers of media and why do we still rely mainly on text in education?
Time to SHIFT.
SHIFT to visual thinking and sharing of our stories. We can spread the POSITIVE stories in education and help other educators and kids.
Before educators can encourage kids to do the same, it's best if they have DONE it themselves!
Our focus was educator learning, doing, creating, and sharing.
Our goal was to take pictures, edit them with different apps, and then share them to a group page on my Flickr account--via my Flickr email. Every person on Flickr gets an email address to use for emailing pictures.
Many educators in the session had not edited pictures and said they rarely took pictures and told the stories of their edu-journeys with kids!
By the end of the session, we enjoyed seeing the pictures of our conference PHOTWALK pop up on my Flickr page. One person used WordFoto and many of us liked it so much, we bought it, too. :)
I showed my blog, Instagram, Twitter media stream, and Flickr account to show examples of the power of telling stories.

As the Eagles prepare for their playoff match-up with the Falcons this Saturday, one of the keys to the game will be in the trenches for Philadelphia. The Eagles had one of the top five Rushing Offenses in the NFL this season ranking Third in Rushing Yards (2,115) and Sixth in Rushing Attempts (473). Meanwhile their Defense during the 2017 season ranked First in Rushing Yards Allowed (1,267) and Third in Rushing Touchdowns Allowed (7). Can the Eagles control the line of scrimmage versus a Falcons team whose Offense is averaged 115.1 Rushing Yards Per Game and a Defense that allowed just 19.7 Points Per Game during the regular season?
ESPN.com NFL Insider KC Joyner joined Mike Gill on Monday discussing how the Eagles and Falcons match-up on the ground and in the trenches:
“(Eagles offense) ranks fourth in the league in Good Blocking Productivity – The Falcons defense is 19th in Good Blocking Rate Allowed; you can get some big runs against them….This is (an Eagles Defense) that does not allow very many big running plays and Atlanta’s Offense should not be able to get the ball moving as much which the concern is if Atlanta knows they can’t run the ball that effectively they will start throwing against the secondary. Which Philadelphia Secondary shows up? Because there have been times this Secondary has looked great and there’s been times it has looked terrible. So if I’m Philadelphia, I almost want to invite Atlanta to run and hope I can keep the game low scoring.”

The Path to Fretboard Path to FretboardStuart Davis, Stellans Technologies Charles Kalil, City of Garden Grove
Chair Burtner asked for a motion to approve the minutes of 2/19/04. The motion to approve was made by Helen Hall, seconded by Nilo Niccolai and unanimously approved by the members present.
All Working Group members are invited and encouraged to be present at the City Council meeting at 4:00 p.m. on March 16, 2004, when the proposal to create a wireless mesh network in downtown Fullerton is presented to the Council for funding.
Charles Kalil, Information Manager, City of Garden, described the evolution and implementation of that city's wireless network. Charles' predecessor initiated the installation of a wireless system in 1999 for the purpose of connecting six police substations. Worldwide Wireless, now known as Global Pacific, connected the six sites at a cost of $60,000. The project was eventually canceled. Garden Grove then investigated the possibility of connecting public safety facilities with DSL telephony, but found that the city would have to pay commercial rates. The cost to the police for operating Motorola radios was $65,000 per year. Consequently, a search began for a less expensive solution.
5G Wireless, Marina del Rey, proposed a point-point system utilizing 802.11b technology with data rates of 3.0-3.5 Mbps. An antenna was placed on city hall with reception at all substations. The cost of the system was $9,000 for the main antenna and $1,500 for each substation. All police substations (9) and fire stations (7) are now linked wirelessly. The network runs on Linux with 128-bit encryption. Interference has been a problem at only one fire station and the maintenance yard has experienced some dropout. The signal passes through or around some trees and buildings. Most sites are elevated relative to their surroundings.
Enterprise System Consulting recommended that Alvarion equip the 802.11b system with frequency hopping. With this system it is possible to connect vehicles such as police cars that are moving at speeds up to 60 mph. It is anticipated that it will take 32-40 access points to cover the city with wireless connectivity. The total cost to build out the city is estimated to be $300,000 including the installation of wireless units in vehicles. The cost to equip each police car including installation is about $5,000. Police equipped with PDAs will be able to connect wirelessly to the system and back to headquarters through the units in the police cars.
Bell Gardens and Laguna Beach have similar wireless networks. Westminster has some hot spots. Grant money is available for the construction of wireless infrastructure for public safety.
Helen Hall and Paul Stover graciously agreed to be responsible for preparing a PowerPoint presentation in support of the proposal to create a wireless mesh network in downtown Fullerton. Paul and Helen will also make the presentation to the Council. The goal is to obtain redevelopment funds in the amount of $56,000 in order to conduct this pilot project. A wireless system for the Fullerton library is included in the request.
Possible presentation by Verilan or Cingular
Next steps regarding wireless implementation for downtown Fullerton
Review of action items
Stuart Davis, Stellans Technologies, a wireless networking company based in Fullerton and a colleague of Working Group member Johnson Lew, offered to donate equipment and labor to create a wireless network in the Fullerton library. Stellans recently completed installing a wireless network in the Anaheim Hilton. Stuart and Johnson said that in a few hours Stellans could set up the wireless network using excess equipment that it already has on hand. The Working Group expressed its appreciation and referred Stuart to Helen Hall and Al Milo, Library Director, for further discussion of the offer.
There being no further business, Chair Burtner asked for a motion to adjourn the meeting. The motion to adjourn was made by David Bailey, seconded by Paul Stover and unanimously approved by the members present. The meeting adjourned at 10:25am.The Biggest Loser Couples Season 7, Episode 11 Video Recap with Pete Thomas
Pete Thomas’ Biggest Loser Video Recap of Week 11
This week was very different since the show opened with the room just after Mandi left. Before they could get up, Alison told them that there was some more to that nights actions. The black team was brought into the room as well and she announced that someone else was going home. They all stood there with nervous looks and she then said they are all going home for this week. Everyone was very happy but there were also some feelings of doubt. The temptations would be many and the group still had to come back to the ranch and weigh-in when the week was over. Could they exist among their friends and family and still lose weight?
Each contestant arrived back at home and their families are amazed at how much weight they lost. The best was when Mike and Ron arrived home. They family still has a boy Max at home where he too is obese and he broke down and started to cry when he saw his brother. Mike promised to help him lose the weight when he got home for good. It was a touching moment and one where it’s hard to see a guy realizing that he’s been doing foolish things to himself for years.
Physical Challenge
The welcome home groups had just left each area and the door bell rang. Outside at the door was a round tall tin with the Biggest Loser logo on it. Inside there was a DVD and 13 huge sugar cookies. When they played the video, Alison was there to say that this week’s challenge was to do a half marathon which was just over 13 miles. Understand that this is episode 11 and just 10 weeks ago they all were the large bodies that had just arrived at the ranch. The one who had the fastest time in the race would win $10000, but for anyone that ate a cookie, they could add on a 5 minute time to a player of their choice. So the times don’t really mean anything until the cookies are counted. Many in the group said that Tara was the biggest threat so each was considering adding time to her. Right away Ron and Mike said they wouldn’t eat the cookies, Sione and Cathy as well. You didn’t know about the other until the count. Everyone but Ron finished the race and some did it in very good times for just having huge amounts of weight on them two and a half months ago. Mandi also ran with her sister even though she just got kicked off the previous week.
Back Home
This week was quite a challenge for most as well since they were among family members and friends. There were choices to make with their workout schedules since they were thrown right back into home life routine. There wasn’t any set time now to go to the ranch gym and they needed to work this out on their own.
Food was also a big challenge where shopping in the familiar area and eating at the same restaurants meant temptations after temptations. Ron and Mike were at a pizza restaurant with a huge amount of family and friends. There were pies spaced about every 2 feet raised high almost in their face. They opted for a salad. Helen was shopping with her husband in a polish market where there were tons of baked good s and sausages. She went for the vegetable aisle instead. I don’t want to say that these players may be doomed when they get back home, but when they had the chance to be on their own during the “luxury” win the week before, they failed miserably.
One of the moments at home this week was to get a feeling of where some of these individuals started. You could see early that Ron’s other kid was quite large, but Aubrey’s father topped out over 500 pounds. She tried to speak to him about losing weight and he mostly joked about it. I don’t see anything helping those that don’t want to help themselves.
Oh Helen
After they all came back to the ranch, Alison gathered them together to explain who won the marathon. Since they all did it at their home, they didn’t have an opportunity to see each others time. She explained that Sione and Tara were by far way ahead of everyone else and that one of them would win. Tara beat Sione by just over a minute, but Helen was the only one that ate a cookie to add to Tara’s time. Sione then won the $10000 by the penalty that Helen gave Tara. Seemed like a nasty thing to do and I’m sure Tara will remember this.
Weigh-In
The numbers were surprising for some since there were still great numbers being pulled even after the group spent the week at home. Mike, Ron, Sione, Aubrey and Helen all lost over 5 pounds. The mother daughter team of Kristin and Cathy did not do as well as Cathy lost just a pound and Kristin gained a pound. In the end, the blue team lost the weigh-in again and was forced to send a player home.
Cathy did a similar thing as Mandi last week and offered up her position to keep her daughter there.

Abortion remains the most unregulated surgical industry in the nation. Some 90% of abortions are not performed in hospitals, but rather in "clinics" which most states exempt from regulation. In fact, in the vast majority of states, veterinary clinics are more regulated than abortion clinics.
Just look at the laws that are or are not on the books. First of all, an abortionist does not have to have a specialty in OB-GYN. Rather, your abortionist may be a urologist, an allergist, or a plastic surgeon. What, furthermore, are the licensing requirements for the staff of abortion clinics? Usually, there are none. How about regulations regarding the presence of emergency medical equipment in the clinic, in case a complication should arise, or the laws governing how such an emergency should be handled? Let me know when you find such laws.
The question, of course, is why is abortion so unregulated? After all, if abortion is a legitimate medical procedure, should it not follow the same standards as other legitimate medical procedures?
The beginning of an answer may be found in the kinds of people who do abortions. Face it, one does not spend years of effort and tens of thousands of dollars to become a doctor in order to be known as an abortionist. Three decades of legalization have not taken the stigma out of abortion. "Fewer and fewer physicians wish to perform abortions" (Journal of Medical Ethics, Volume 22, 1996).
As a result, this area of "medical" practice remains as shady as it ever was, and attracts the losers and washouts of the medical community. I know many of those that used to perform abortions and no longer do. Some, in fact, posed as doctors without having spent a day in medical school. Others testify that they never sterilized the instruments. And stories of sexual abuse in abortion clinics abound. This, remember, is taking place in legal abortion clinics.
Another key point to keep in mind is that despite whatever statistics or reports you may see, nobody knows or has a way of knowing how many women are being injured, raped, and killed in legal abortion clinics. The abortion industry has largely been left to police itself, and the women who are mistreated have quite a burden of shame to overcome, because in seeking redress, they have to admit they had an abortion. One thing, though, is for sure: the more you look for documented instances of abortion malpractice, the more you find.
So what are we in the pro-life community asking? We are calling for a full investigation of what is going on in abortion clinics. Furthermore, we call for more states to exercise their Constitutionally protected right to regulate abortion clinics. We are also calling on the "pro-choice" groups to be honest. Being in favor of women's rights and health should include action to insure that clinics protect women against the malpractice of unscrupulous abortionists. After all, if you care about the exploitation of women, you care about it no matter who is doing the exploiting.Learn basic graphic design principles anyone can use to make business documents more visually appealing. »I have been researching off and on for a few years.

While many people believed the feud between Kanye West and 50 Cent ended on the stage at Madison Square Garden last Wednesday (August 22) when the superstar rappers appeared together alongside Jay-Z, Sean "Diddy" Combs and T.I., it appears it will not end until September 11, the day Kanye West's Graduation and 50 Cent's album Curtis hits stores.
50 Cent shot down any notion of Kanye West outselling him on September 11 and also claimed the rapper "sucks."
"It's friendly feud but its not possible for Kanye to beat me," 50 Cent said during an interview on AJ's Playhouse on radio station 93.3 in San Diego, California. "It's the 'Teddy Bear' vs. The Gorilla."
50 Cent also charged that West's label Def Jam would not play fair on the day the album hits stores.
"Def Jam is going to buy about 200,000 of them [Kanye's records,]" 50 Cent charged during the interview. "The following week you are going to see a 70% decrease, easy. You know what's gonna happen. Even Jay-Z himself, the first week is huge [of his last album Kingdom Come] and then he just disappeared."
50 Cent also confirmed the "I Get Money" remix will feature Jay-Z and Sean "Diddy" Combs.
"Kanye sucks," 50 said. "I'm going to be honest, he sounds like a robot, he has a robot record," ridiculing West's hit single "Stronger."
50 also told AJ's Playhouse that West was annoyed when 50 Cent got on the stage at the Screamfest concert with fellow rap titan Jay-Z.
During his Graduation album preview in Manhattan, West said: "[It] felt aight [referring to the )...would of felt better to be on stage like me and Jay planned."
"Jay-Z and Kanye West had their plans for them to just be there, but then I decided we were gonna share that moment," 50 said. "If you look at the tape, Kanye crossed his arms cause I bumped into him and said 'man you had to come up here huh?,'" 50 Cent said today about the rappers' unification on the stage. "He was mad at first until it dawned on him what it was."
West also brushed off the notion of any real "feud" between the two chart topping rappers during the Graduation preview.
"This is the first time we let the press do all the work," West said of the feud, adding that 50 Cent wouldn't have stood a chance had it not been for his hit single " "I Get Money."Social login

On a winter night in 2002, Christopher Yanov, the founder and sole staff member of Reality Changers, sat with a handful of eighth graders and their college-student tutors in a meeting room in the IglesThe project to shift privately owned dairies to a consolidated unit in the outskirts of the city, to prevent choking up of the city's already poor drainage system, has been in limbo for over a decade now. Waste such as cow dung cakes and fodder from these dairies have been a prime reason for blockage in city's sewerage which in turn leads to water logging, especially during the monsoon.
The problem is severe in areas within the walled city as dairy owners washed away waste directly into the main sewer lines. Apart from the unhygienic conditions caused by drainage erupting on to streets, traffic also was affected because of cattle roaming on the streets.
Some of the worst-affected areas are Bishan Nagar, Khalsa Mohalla, Arjun Nagar, Sukhdas Pura Mohalla, Arya Samaj, Jattan Wala Chotran, Badungar Colony, Anand Nagar, Tripri, Raghumajra, Sant nagar, Sewak Colony, Arora Street, Dogra Mohalla, Naam Dakha Road, Safabadi Gate, and Nabha Gate.
As per the proposed project, all private dairies would be shifted to a 20-acre land in Ablowal village, in the outskirts of Patiala. Plots would be allotted to dairy owners on the basis of number of animals in their unit.Joint commissioner Nazar Singh said, "We have no alternative other than shifting the dairies as it is a complete nuisance in the city. Besides, health concerns arising from blocked sewers necessitate the shifting as it will not be possible for PMC workers to clear dairy waste on a daily basis."
Saying that strategies for the shifting were being discussed, he added that shifting the dairies to outside the city would not affect the business of the owners as the civic body would take note of their business before shifting them out.« pics from the Pietasters boat show, more dates & The Business & The Slackers too | What's going on Monday? »

DOWNLOAD: Born Gold - "Alabaster Bodyworlds" (MP3)
Born Gold (via Gobble Gobble's facebook)
Canadian electropop futurists Gobble Gobble changed their name to Born Gold last week. The members are the same, the music is even more paralyzing. They'll release their debut LP under the new name, Bodysongs, on September 20 via Hovercraft/Crash Symbols. You can pre-order the album now on Insound and receive a digital download on September 9. Megan James of Purity Ring, the duo in which Born Gold's Corin Roddick is also a member designed the cover art. Check that artwork out below, along with the tracklist.
Grace your ears with the album's lead track, "Alabaster Bodyworlds," which you can grab above. It's skittering jungle beats and tropical electropop sounds like the perfect thing to throw on as you're cruising through rainforests in your spacecraft. You know, because people do that, right?
Born Gold will tour the US and Canada in support of their new album and new name this September and October. The tour includes dates with Blood Diamonds, Dan Deacon, Washed Out, Magic Mountain, Braids and more. They'll play Brooklyn on September 20 at Glasslands and continue to tour for the next month before culminating their run with CMJ shows in NYC. Those shows have not been announced yet. Tickets are on sale now for the Glasslands show. No opener has been announced yet.
Purity Ring also has shows coming up with Neon Indian including the Webster Hall show during CMJ.
Blood Diamonds and Magic Mountain (DJ), who play some shows with Born Gold, share a bill at Glasslands on August 26 with Tanlines (DJ) and Braille (DJ). Tickets for that show are still available.
Braids have other shows coming up too.
Washed Out have an upcoming tour with Cut Copy and Midnight Magic.

SheKnows is making some changes!One of the two Australian radio jockeys, involved in a hoax call to a United Kingdom hospital treating a pregnant Kate Middleton that apparently led to the suicide of an Indian-origin nurse, has said she was depressed and ashamed of herself and the prank call should never have been aired.
“I don’t ever want to listen to it (the recording of the prank call) again, because I’m ashamed of myself. I should have tried harder not to let that prank call air. It never should have aired,” a tearful Mel Greig said during an interview. “You’re meeting a Mel that has no confidence, a Mel that’s so lost with her life, a Mel that feels so much blame and so much guilt nine months down the track. This Mel’s depressed,” said Greig.
Indian-origin nurse Jacintha Saldanha, 46, had been found hanging days after the call from 2Day FM radio jockeys Greig and Michael Christian posing as the royal family in late 2012. The duo had posed as Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Charles on the phone.
Saldanha had answered the call at the King Edward VII Hospital in London and put them through to another nurse who gave an update on the Duchess of Cambridge’s condition.
Greig said she wanted the voices of the two nurses at the hospital to be disguised, but station bosses said no. Saldanha left a note blaming them for her death. Greig said she has been depressed and is no longer the fun-loving person she was before the notorious prank call, broadcast by the Sydney radio station 2day FM.
She said she and her family had received death threats. “They’d ring my mum and say, ‘Eye for an eye, you need to die because she died.’ So many horrible calls. Dad was rushed to hospital from the stress and I thought, ‘Great, now I’ve killed my dad too’.”
When asked if she wanted to apologise to the nurse’s family, Greig said,  prank call had sparked international outrage against the radio station following Saldanha’s subsequent suicide.

articleNotebooks geeks everywhere are rejoicing as today marks the official launch of Intel’s Centrino 2. We’ve known about this for a long time but the day is finally here. There were a few delays, but the kinks were worked out and in finally Montevina is available along with a number of new notebooks. Any upgrade this big comes long with a slew of new notebooks from all the big players.
The Centrino 2 platform is built on three components: the processor, wireless module, and chipset, all provided by Intel. This release brings along upgrades to each aspect so while the typical consumer may not be excited about a new platform there is a lot to gain from the update.
The most noticeable change is the new set of processors, all of which are 45nm products with a 1066MHz FSB. They are:
– X9100 Core 2 Extreme, 3.06GHz, 6MB cache, 44W TDP
– T9600 Core 2 Duo, 2.80GHz, 6MB cache, 35W TDP
– T9400 Core 2 Duo, 2.53GHz, 6MB cache, 35W TDP
– P9500 Core 2 Duo, 2.53GHz, 6MB cache, 25W TDP
– P8600 Core 2 Duo, 2.40GHz, 3MB cache, 25W TDP
– P8400 Core 2 Duo, 2.26GHz, 3MB cache, 25W TDP
More processors are on the way, but today we are also seeing upgraded graphics and improved WiFi. These tend to be evolutionary changes from the last generation (Santa Rosa) but they are enough that you’ll want to stronger consider spending Centrino if you are looking for a new system (as opposed to saving a bit and getting something older). The graphics package moves to X4500 with Deep Power Down switchable technology, RAM is upgraded from DDR2 to DDR3, and the wireless component gets the Intel Wi-Fi Link 5000 802.11 draft-n wireless module. Basically there are a lot of incremental changes, with some cool new technology sprinkled about.
Thanks to Centrino 2’s arrival just about every notebook manufacturer is refreshing their product line. We already highlighted the ThinkPad X200 (and the news of the other ThinkPads leaked earlier) but that is just the start. There are new models (and killed old models) from a number of companies including, Sony, Toshiba, HP, Fujitsu, and Acer.
Read more at Intel’s Press Room. Geek.com will have reviews up of as many of these notebooks as soon as we get our hands on them. So keep checking in and post any requests in the comments.
Reader CommentsLakers Rumors & News Recap: The Bobcats Will See Gasol
The Lakers return to Staples Center tonight after their four-game road trip, where they won two games and lost two. L.A. is looking to get a third straight win against the struggling Bobcats, who are currently in an 11-game slump. The Lakers have an all-time record of 7-8 against the Bobcats with a 5-3 record against Charlotte at Staples Center. L.A. is currently at 11-14.
Gasol is back in action tonight as a Lakers starter. The Lakers went 3-5 without him and 8-9 with him. Gasol didn’t exactly play up to par before he decided to sit games down because of tendinitis on both knees but L.A. needs some power in the center position. Pau is ready to deliver that tonight as he plans to be as explosive as ever.
Even with the added talent, Mike D’Antoni said the recent news about Pau Gasol’s return won’t necessarily change the game plan for tonight’s game. All that will be different are the off the bench and starter options. Although the Bobcats have dropped the last 11 straight games, they are a team that knows how to force turnovers, especially through their full-court press. With the Lakers having a turnover issue recently, this could be a problem.
More injury update news. Steve Nash is looking to return to the Los Angeles Lakers’ lineup Saturday against the Golden State Warriors if practice goes well this week. If he isn’t able to make it this weekend, the PG will hopefully start on Christmas Day. He has missed 23 games this season after suffering a fractured left fibula on Nov. 1 against the Portland Trail Blazers during the second season game. Jordan Hill has also been out with back spasms the past two games and won’t be playing tonight.

The past three college football seasons we have seen vast numbers of suspensions issued, coaches forced out, and fans standing dumbfounded with mouths wide open in awe after rulings were handed down by NCAA officials for rule violations.
Yes, some are warranted. Recruiting players illegally being one of them. But where I seem to get lost in translation is when players are given multiple game or full season suspensions for actions that do not give their school an advantage on the playing field.
Case in point, former Oklahoma State star wide-out Dez Bryant. Bryant was suspended for the last nine games of the 2009-2010 season for lying to the NCAA about visiting with Hall of Fame Cornerback Deion Sanders.
Bryant’s only infraction during the whole situation was lying to the NCAA about the visit. The visit was in no way against the rules.
Bryant gained nothing financially, or physically to give him an advantage over opponents on the field, but OSU still paid the price eventually losing to Oklahoma and Texas which kept them from playing in their conference championship game.
Then, former University of Georgia standout wide receiver A.J. Green was suspended for the first four games of last season for allegedly selling his 2009 Independence Bowl game jersey for $1,000 to former University of North Carolina player Chris Hawkins, who the NCAA labeled an “agent.”
Green simply sold his personal possession to an interested buyer, bringing no unfair advantage to the university on or off the field, but UGA began the season 1-3 with it’s only victory during Green’s suspension coming against Louisiana-Lafayette.
Finally, Ohio State University is left in shambles after six players admittedly bartered team memorabilia for tattoos and, at times, cash.
On top of five game suspensions for all the players involved, Ohio State Coach Jim Tressel was asked by the university to resign for lying to the NCAA, claiming he had no knowledge of players receiving improper benefits.
Tressel was most certainly guilty of lying to the NCAA investigators, but why would an esteemed coach make such a terrible blunder? The only rational reason one can gather, was because he wanted to protect his team, as a whole, from a rule that is quite frankly unjust.
Since when is it illegal in America to sell your own belongings, or in this case, trade them? How does a player getting cash for a jersey he will never wear again justify a five-game suspension from the NCAA?
To me, the punishment does not fit the crime. Especially when the punishment is handed down from the NCAA, an association that makes hundreds of millions of dollars off of these kids each year.
Illegally recruiting players is wrong. Punching other players in the face after a game is wrong. Injecting one’s self with steroids is wrong. All of these things, justifiably, are punishable and worthy of the term “violation.”
But when considering the Ohio State, Green, and Bryant cases I cannot help but ask my self; who is really being violated?

Page Tools
London: The British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, wants to restrict the number of young people coming to Britain from Commonwealth countries as working holiday-makers after what is said to be a "dramatic rise" in applications from Africa and the Indian subcontinent.
A leaked memo shows that Mr Blair wants annual quotas for the Commonwealth working holiday-maker scheme, under which people aged under 30 can come to Britain for two years and take casual work, especially where there is a labour shortage such as in catering and hospitality. Most working holiday-makers are from South Africa, Australia and New Zealand.
The Home Secretary, David Blunkett, made a determined effort last summer to widen the scheme to countries such as Nigeria, India and Pakistan.
But a Downing Street "immigration stocktake" last month identified a greater-than-expected rise in applications and some attempts at abuse.
The leaked memo shows that Mr Blair and Mr Blunkett are considering quotas for the old "white" and the new "black" Commonwealth. But the quotas are more likely to bite against countries such as Bangladesh and Sierra Leone.
Among proposals in the memo is the introduction of "quotas based on historical take-up of the Commonwealth holiday-maker scheme before the recent increase in applications. These quotas to be reviewed annually."
The memo also suggests restricting the scheme to countries with "satisfactory return arrangements". Britain recently concluded return agreements with India and Pakistan, but they do not cover all Commonwealth countries.
The memo says "quotas would require careful handling to avoid accusations or perceptions of discrimination, while closing down the scope for abuse". It says the "Government has been a victim of its own success in making the scheme more accessible to 'new Commonwealth' countries", reflected in the jump in applications.
Downing Street confirmed a clampdown was imminent.
The GuardianAfter a long day full of work and confusion, I decided that it would be a good idea to go to the poetry reading at eight PM. I got all of my homework done and ate dinner also. It was now about seven twenty and I heard a knock at my front door. It was my RA; he was just reminding me that he was going to leave in a few minutes. Soon Jeff, another girl and I headed to the place where the reading was taking place. When we got there, all the seats in the back were full. This ended the back up plan, which consist of leaving out if the poet was very bad. We soon found three seats in the middle of the auditorium. The electrical people were all over the stage trying to get the microphone to work. After about twenty minutes of watching people trying to fix the microphone, I was very convinced that I was not going to like this night. Mr. Andrews Hudgins reminded me of the stereotypical unibomber, who had no microphone and recited poems such as the “Pissy Christ”; those are just a couple of reasons why I really disliked this poet and his poetry.
The poet looked a lot like someone who would be in the paper listed as the unibomber. He was a middle-aged balding man who looked a lot like a killer. Mr. Hudgins spoke with a tone of a crazy man, but the main problem was his type of poetry. When he started to read his poems, I was completely disappointed in his choice of topics. The type of poems that he read reinforced how I felt about his image at first. As the program progressed Mr. Hudgins appeared to be crazier than I thought in the beginning.
Aside from his scary appearance, Mr. Hudgins was practically yelling the entire time because he had no microphone. When we walked in and sat down, there were people walking all on stage and in the sound room. At first no one knew why the electricians were walking around, and I really could care less why the people were walking around. All I cared about at that time was hearing some poetry and going home. Since the microphone did not seem to be working, and everyone seemed to be getting a little impatient; the show went on.
During the whole show Mr. Hudgins was yelling. He was trying to make sure the whole audience heard his poetry; however, this was not to his benefit because he was already a site to look at, and he made lots of facial expressions which did not complement his features at all. Just imagine the unibomber yelling at you about a “Pissy Christ.” To most people that is enough to disgust and disappoint all in one. I was looking forward to hearing some nice romantic soft poetry; instead, I felt as though I was in a lion’s den surrounded by loud playing Punk Rock music.
The worst thing, besides the appearance of the poet and his vocal energy, was his type of poetry. People who prefer his type harsh poetry might have enjoyed the program, but people like myself who like more subtle and relaxing poetry would not enjoy Mr. Hudgins at all. He had poems such as: “My Fathers Corpse,” “Babylon in a Jar,” “Rain” and “Pissy Christ.” The only poem he recited that did not have any thing to do with blood was “The China Berry Tree,” which I could not even hear because he had no microphone.
The two worst poems I heard that night were “Rain” and “Pissy Christ.” The poem titled “Rain” was very negative. It was about a murderer who was killing women all over town, and scattering their body parts around off of different highways. I think that the media exploits subjects such as murder, and writing a poem about a murderer is only adding to the problem. I was even more appalled because the poem never mentioned a man being killed and scattered all over the highway. I am not condoning this type of poetry, but why must society find this constant image of women being a weaker sex as an entertaining topic. I feel that women are weaker in some aspects, but this type of poetry is very unnecessary.
The last poem that Hudgins recited was called “Pissy Christ.” When I heard the title of this poem I was very tempted to walk out; however, I figured since it was his last poem maybe I should stay. In this poem he talked about Christ Jesus being born through the womb of his mother. The reason for his title was because he stated that the womb is in between the anus and the pee whole. The poem went on to say that Christ was covered with blood and piss when born from his mother’s womb. As if this was not a topic that I would have wanted to hear he went on and on about it. Hudgins said that when Christ was being put on the cross he was pissy, and bloody like a newborn baby. I am a person who is very conscience of the way Christ is talked about, and something about this poem just did not seem morally correct to me.
I was totally disappointed with Mr. Hudgins and his horrible poetry. I was very disgusted and upset when I left the reading. If I would have known that it was going to be that bad, I would have stayed in my room and studied. I did not like the poet’s appearance, tone, or his type of poetry. I went to the reading in a good mood, and came back home contemplating whether or not I should ever go to another one again. I was totally disappointed and would highly recommend that people who like smooth mellow poetry like myself, never to go to the reading of Andrew Hudgins poetry. It will only upset you, and leave you wondering what made him write about such negative subjects.« sadia & mike: engaged | sebastian: first birthday »
so here we are again with mark and beth. weather/schedules prevented us from doing a full shoot the first time around, but we were stressed that the giant peach was going to deflate, so we crammed in a quick session with him, even though it was raining. oh ye of little faith! peachy survived a whole other week and from what i’m told, is still hovering until this day.
let me just tell you that these people are amazing. i started to get to know beth a couple years ago and my life has been blessed by her ever since. you know those super awesome drawings my website is littered with? you know that person who took my dream brand and made it a reality? the one who pretty much crawled into my brain, dragged out my ideas and put them on paper more beautifully than i could have imagined? oh yeah. that’s her. plus she’s so fun to hang out with and my kids love her. if you ever come over to my house, you’ll know why simon refers to her as “beff. elephant”.
and mark…talk about one of the sweetest most genuine guys. ever. i was suspicious of him at first, when beth told me about this mysterious fellow who lived across the country who would just fly in and out on a whim to see her. what if he has a whole other family in another city that you don’t know about? and why does he just disappear every time i think i’m going to meet him? ok, so he works for westjet. and he doesn’t have a whole other family. and he ended up moving to abbotsford and i got to know him and he’s actually really nice.
i’m glad you found one another. you two are so. so. good together. i am over the moon, as your friend AND your photographer, to walk this walk with you.

L.A. Times Praises Actor Lee Byung Hun, "Korea's Brad Pitt"
By Staff Writer | October 02, 2012 10:04 AM EDT
Actor Lee Byung Hun receives praise from the LA. Times.
On September 29, the L.A. Times had a post with the title, 'Korean Actor Shines in L.A.' and released an interview with Lee Byung Hun.
The article stated, "The moment he began to translate and speak, his appearance changed dramatically. His voice was deep as he sat in a straight posture with sharp eyes. We could see why he is called the Korean 'Brad Pitt'."
Lee Byung Hun is famous in the states for his Hollywood movie appearances in "G.I Joe" and "Red 2."
Last month, Lee Byung Hun's movie, "Gwanghae" held its red carpet premiere at the LA county Museum of Art.

The original legislation from Republican Rep. Mike Kuglitsch, of New Berlin, would have invested $25 million in state money and additional private money in the venture capital fund overseen by the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. The agency would have hired a fund manager to oversee the investments.
But Kuglitsch and other bill sponsors put out an amended version Wednesday that would have the Department of Administration oversee the venture capital program.

While the attempt to protect consumers and reinstitute protections that were given prior to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act in 1999 is admirable, the Volcker Rule, as currently proposed, is flawed. Much of what the intent behind the rule will be watered down by lobbyists, and what is a chance to keep the financial sector in check, will be lost.
My biggest concern with the proposed rule is the length. While regulating can be a complicated task, a 298 page rule is in danger of being too complex to implement. Regardless of the substance of the final rule, an exorbitant amount of money will be spent by financial institutions in litigation. Banks will spend whatever amount of money is required to have courts determine that they do not fall into the precise technical language of the rule, making it inapplicable to them. Should the rule be constructed loosely to allow for case-by-case agency determination, banks will still litigate the Volcker Rule, but courts will be more willing to defer to the SECs expertise, making the applicability of the rule more widespread and effective. This will give more credence to the overall goal of the Volcker Rule, which is consumer protection.
The agency, while taking careful criticism into mind when deciding on the final rule, must be sure that it has not been captured by industry. The legislative intent behind the Dodd-Frank Act was to ensure banks do not speculate against its own customers to their detriment. It is this intent the agency must have in mind when faced with the cries of economic hardship from the financial industry.Looking out the window as you approach by plane you will see that the Saudi Arabian capital of Riyadh, with its striking, soaring towers and busy tangle of streets and highways, is every inch a modern metropolis.
Once you’re on the ground and winding your way through the traffic-filled streets, you’ll find it’s a bustling place both night and day - not surprising given it’s the Kingdom’s chief political, financial and commercial hub.
Between its importance as a business centre and its role as home turf for most foreign embassies (including the Canadian and U.S. embassies), everywhere you go you’ll see a mix of nationalities. In fact, Riyadh’s population—upwards of 7 million if you include the city’s outlying regions—is roughly 35% international.
That mix is also reflected in the city’s restaurant culture —with a lengthy list of well-reviewed options that includes noodle houses, Brazilian barbecues, steak houses, French cafes, Chinese restaurants and, of course, authentic Middle Eastern eateries.
The old and new co-exist everywhere in Riyadh. The glittering towers of the city are entirely surrounded by desert. Shopping malls built by world-famous architects attract shoppers while other more curious individuals visit traditional souqs (markets). A brand-new museum houses models and exhibits of the region’s ancient and not-so-ancient history.
The city is affectionately called the “desert pearl” by many, although the literal translation of the name Riyadh is derived from the Arabic word for garden.
Despite the international presence, Riyadh is a conservative city. Generally, Saudi women wear the abaya, a long black cloak, and cover their hair and face when in public. Western women wear the abaya and don’t usually have to cover their hair. Typically, Saudi men wear the thobe and ghutrah in public.
Arabic is the official language, but everywhere you go you will also hear people speaking English. In fact, English is the main language in business, including in the hospitals, and it’s a compulsory second language in schools. The majority of expatriates, no matter where they come from, also speak at least some English.
For those with energy to burn, there’s no shortage of options in Riyadh. There are organized hiking and camping expeditions, sandboarding, tennis, swimming and golfing. Joining a team to play soccer, road hockey, rugby or cricket also has the built-in benefit of a helping to develop a social network.
There are plenty of modern shopping malls as well as traditional markets (souqs) where you’ll find everything from carpets to antique brass coffee pots. Brush up on your negotiating skills—it’s a sport in most souqs.
The stunning and distinctive Kingdom Tower has a hold-onto-your-hat elevator ride that will whisk you, at 180km/h (or 112 mph), to the 99th floor Sky Bridge for unbeatable city views. It also houses a large shopping mall, which features a women-only floor.
Within the 44 floors of the The Al-Faisaliah Tower, you’ll find four high-end restaurants, one luxury hotel, a shopping mall and a remarkable city view from the structure’s enormous glass globe.
There’s also the National Museum, known as one of the finest in the Middle East. It houses eight galleries, depicting—through paintings, re-creations, films and more—the area’s art, history and culture.
Just outside of Riyadh is the city of Diriyah, the original home of the Saudi royal family. You can wander through the original city’s historic mud-brick ruins (including palaces, watch towers and a bath house).
Since it’s located in the desert, and not particularly close to any other cities, you’ll almost certainly be flying into Riyadh. It’s served by King Khaled International Airport. Riyadh is approximately 1,061 km (660 miles) from Jeddah, on the west coast, and about 447 km (278 miles) from Dhahran, on the east coast.
Located in the heart of the desert, Riyadh is, as you might expect, hot and dry most of the year, though it can be quite cool overnight in the winter.
If you’re interested in learning more about working in Riyadh, see our Frequently Asked Questions or Contact Us for more information.

- All Anime Is Naughty Tentacles: Spoofed in the "Cutie Cutie Kid Cupids" world, with the "Hent High Fighting Tentacles".
- Animated Actors
- Animesque: Cutie Cutie Kid Cupids.
- Anti-Hero:.
- Anti-Villain: Brad. Star really likes him at least.
- Art Shift: More or less the main gimmick, as each comic has Captain Smiley and Star change their outfit to fit in with the comic.
- Aside Glance: When Mistress Ropes summons the Meat Monster in the final stage, she gives an exasperated look towards the audience whenever it starts eating itself.
- BFS: To go along with his Cloud Strife cosplay, Smiley's melee weapon in Cutie Cutie Kid Cupids is pretty much a buster sword with a giant heart at the end of it.
- Bishie Sparkle and Petal Power: Not seen on-screen, but Brad complains about sparkles and rose petals appearing around him when he's trapped in Cutie Cutie Kid Cupids.
- Book Ends: Pixel dev team looking at the comic and getting an idea. Pixel dev team looking at the comic and nodding in approval while they stand in the middle of a giant pile of money.
- Buffy Speak: Oh so much.
- Butt Monkey: Captain Smiley. At one point it becomes literal.
- Calling Your Attacks: The manga stages are full of it, naturally."Big Cartoony Heart!"
- Color Failure: Smiley briefly loses his color when he's damaged, and when his health is too low it starts to stay that way.
- Continuity Nod: The events of Twisted Pixel's previous games are mentioned in universe. There's reference to a series of underground 'splosions believed to be coming from research labs and astronomers discover that several solar systems have disappeared, with only a strange purple substance left behind.
- The Comics Code: Mocked during the Silver Age levels, when Star's cursing is constantly being censored, and you get slapped with a fine whenever you attack a puppet guard. The hypocrisy of the code allowing a deeply racist main character but no swearing is also lampshaded.
- Crapsaccharine World: The world of The Cutie Cutie Kid Cupids; to the point where Brad is nearly Driven to Suicide by it.
- Defeat Means Roommates: After you beat a boss, they are forced to move in with Captain Smiley until they get back on their feet. Neither party likes this arrangement.
- Deadpan Snarker: He isn't deadpan, but Star has quite the razor wit.
- Deliberately Monochrome: The world of Cutie Cutie Kid Cupids is done in screen tones, like a real manga.
- Distressed Damsel: Mocked in Smiley's own comic, when Gerda is Bound (but not Gagged) in the background and Smiley makes absolutely no attempt to rescue her (which she Lampshades). The building explodes just after you leave.
- Downer Ending: Smiley successfully reboots his comic and wins the approval of the comic reading public, but the developers at Twisted Pixel swindle him out of the profits by contract, his sidekick Gerda resigns in disgust, and his co-workers hate him more than ever.
- To be fair he did learn that it should be more about violence, action and some minor nudity.
- Rule of Funny, man.
- Epic Fail: A particularly gutbusting example is the reason for Smiley's comic readership dropping off.
- Even Evil Has Standards: Star is a total jerk, but even he's offended at the casual racism and misogyny of a Silver Age comic book.
- Everything Is Trying to Kill You: Pretty much. Paper planes, puppets, and other improbable things are all trying to kill you. It can feel as though the developers are trying to kill you much of the time.
- Expy: Brad is a villainous Duke Nukem.
- Fan Dumb: In universe, when Smiley reads letters from fans at the end of the first "Improbable Paper Pals" issue.
- Fake Difficulty: Many have pointed out that the game seems to be missing Health Pickups, although infinite lives offset this problem.
- The RPG mechanic only exists to provide stat upgrades and never adds additional abilities. Later stages are practically impossible without these upgrades, thereby forcing the player to grind the optional Missions in order to proceed.
- The world of Cutie Cutie Kid Cupids is entirely grayscale. This makes several incoming attacks extremely difficult to see.
- Fat Bastard: Nanoc really let himself go after Puttmaster kicked him out of his kingdom
- Femme Fatalons: On Mistress Ropes' modern costume.
- Fourth Wall Observer
- "Friends" Rent Control: Justified, because Twisted Pixel (the game's developers) paid for the base. Somehow.
- Gameplay Roulette: It swaps between a few gameplay styles, including scrolling Beat 'em Up, scrolling Shoot 'em Up and mostly-on-rails Third-Person Shooter.
- Genius Bruiser: Brad gives every appearance of being a shallow, egotistical Jerk Jock, but apparently he has constructed his own robotic harem of shallow blondes to service him, a high tech battle helicopter and even produced his own theme music. Insipid he might be, but he's certainly not without talents.
- Genki Girls: Pretty much every schoolgirl in Cutie Cutie Kid Cupids.
- Giant Space Flea from Nowhere: Benny from the Silver Age level, as well as the giant head from the Manga level.
- God Guise: There's one based around mini-golf in "Nanoc the Obliviator", of which Smiley's old foe the Puttmaster takes advantage.
- Guns Akimbo
- Hoist By Her Own Petard: Mistress Ropes in the final stage.
- Hotter and Sexier: Mistress Ropes becomes this when she transitions to the modern era.
- Hulk Speak: Dr. Winklemeyer.
- Hypocritical Humor: At the start of the game Smilely shows his disgust at Brad glorifying himself with a theme song stating "they were above that sorta thing". Come the final level however, he showcases his own theme song.
- I Know Madden Kombat: The Puttmaster.
- Insane Troll Logic: The Captain, right at the beginning in a wonderfully narmy Establishing Character Moment with Gerda at the receiving end.
- It's All About Me: Captain Smiley.
- At the end of the game, he finally learns that it's not all about him. It's also about explosions. Explosions and trite, poorly timed catch phrases blatantly robbed from films. And bathroom humor. And maybe some exposed female flesh, too. But definitely explosions.
- Japanese Stock Phrases: A 'sugoi' is dropped at one point in Cutie Cutie Kid Cupids.
- Jerk Ass: Every character to a certain degree, although Star probably the most. His entire life is apparently spent annoying and undermining Smiley while providing no help at all. He even takes giddy delight when Smiley accidentally murders an innocent old man at the beginning of Nanoc's comic.
- Jerk with a Heart of Gold: Zigzagging Trope. During the whole game, Smiley appears as a pure and unadultered Jerkass, only caring about his image and money. But he's also shown feeling awful about killing an innocent old man and crashing his funeral. He then really try to understand Miss Ropes and calm her down instead of shooting her. Finally, there is his relationship with her sidekick Gerda. It's obvious he doesn't respect her at all, laughing at her when she's about to get exploded in a sea of TNT but she never tried to earn it, mocking and insulting him repeatedly during his missions. Strangely, he genuinely cares about Star when he seems to feel sick, even if the guy had no problem before to show he literally hates him.
- Kill 'em All: Smiley both delightfully lets Gerda die again and brutally kills each nemesis in the final stage. When you get back to the base afterward, they're all pissed at him and quit, Gerda included.
- Even the dev team is implied to be killed when their pet monkey throws a stick of dynamite into the giant pile of money they're standing in.
- Love Bubbles: Smiley's gun fires them in the Manga segments, until Brad gives Smiley real bullets.
- Mad Scientist: Dr. Winklemeyer, who seems to be less "scientist" and more "mad".
- Magical Girl: The "Shoujo" manga stage seems to borrow mostly from Magical Girl tropes, including the main characters' mascot animal and Smiley spending most of the stage fighting dark shadowy beings with The Power of Love.
- Martial Arts and Crafts
- Mecha-Mooks: Brad builds his own Valley Girl henchmen/groupies, called the Bradbots. Star approves.
- "You can make them do anything you want! Heh heh!"
- Money, Dear Boy: The entire plot is so Smiley can get his comic back in circulation. Parodied by Twisted Pixel during the live action montage in the end.
- More Dakka: Smiley's gun fighting method has much more to do with saturation than finesse. In the final stage his default pistols are upgraded into an even more potent form with a three foot long muzzle flare.
- My Suit Is Also Super: And it comes with a wisecracking face called Star.
- No Fourth Wall: Most characters know they're in comic books. They often mention 'panels', 'writers' and such. They don't know they're in a game, though Smiley and Star can talk to the developers. You can even call on the developers of Twisted Pixel to help you out in combat, literally Breaking the Fourth Wall in the process.
- Offscreen Moment of Awesome: Apparently Origami Kid was missing this whole time because he was off having wacky time travel-related adventures.
- One-Hit-Point Wonder: Captain Smiley becomes one in the extra Challenge missions.
- Only Sane Woman: Gerda and Nordya
- The Power of Love: Manga!Smiley's guns shoot hearts and bubbles, until he finally finds some real bullets and can start actually killing things.
- Prop Recycling: Mistress Ropes conjurs the final boss out of Captain Smiley's thoughts. He had beaten 'Splosion Man recently, so he thought of the meat monster.
- Purely Aesthetic Era: More like "purely aesthetic comic book genre". The gameplay is varied, but what comic genre you're in doesn't seem to make a difference; Smiley still shoots his guns, destroys homing missiles, has projectiles shot/thrown at him, and so on.
- Ridiculously Human Robot: The Bradbots. Well, they're about as "human" as anyone else in the game, anyway.
- Screw This, I'm Outta Here!: Gerda and all of the villains come to this on Captain Smiley after the final stage.
- Smug Super: Smiley himself.
- Sdrawkcab Name: Nanoc
- Sexbot: Implied to be part of the Bradbots' function.
- Shout-Out: Many.
Star: This is all Richard Hammond's fault!
- The "comic jumper" machine is pretty much the time travel device used in Timecop. An unlocked piece of concept art had it being even closer in look.
- Gauntlet: "Captain needs food badly!"
- Resident Evil 4: Winklemeyer (in a gruff voice): "What're ya buying?"
- Total Recall (1990) (1990): Benny. Just...Benny. He's got five kids!
- Final Fantasy VII: Smiley's design in the Manga world is clearly based on Cloud Strife.
- According to the interviews on the website, Bottle Fairy was one of the big influences on the "Cutie Cutie Kid Cupids" stage, with its over-the-top cuteness and cheerfulness.
- Later the sub-bosses divide their health in segments, each one getting a different, individually named pattern.
- The developers lampshade all these shout outs by having Smiley sometimes say, "Pop culture reference goes here!"
- Several references to Jurassic Park.
- You die like Megaman, while Smiley mocks you for dying 3/4 the time.
- At one point Smiley chooses a destructor much like Back to the Future. Winklemeyer's helmet also seems to be intended to resemble the one Doc Brown is seen wearing.
- Brad looks rather like a beefed-up Sketch Turner from Comix Zone.
- Don't say you played the unicorn segments of Cutie Cutie Kid Cupids and didn't think "Always, I wanna be with you, and make believe with you, and live in harmony harmony OH LOVE"
- Manga!Star looks very similar to Starfy.
- Did Mistress Ropes just conjure up a giant monster based on what one of the main characters was thinking of at the time?
- Silver Age
- Stop Helping Me!: Star hates Captain Smiley and loves Brad.
- Plus Gerda (un)helpfully pointing out when your health is running low.
- Straw Feminist: Mistress Ropes. Played for Laughs. When you defeat her, she gets Hotter and Sexier.
- Take That, Us
- Star complains that The Maw was ripping people off, with DLC that should have been in the game to begin with. Guess who made that game.
- The real joke there is that Comic Jumper has three hidden, unlockable levels... for 'Splosion Man!
- There's also an announcement made to all Twisted Pixel staff to stop using pop culture references, as nobody thinks they're funny. Plus they can't afford the lawsuits.
- Talking to Himself: The same guy, Christopher Sabat, voices Captain Smiley and Star.
- Theme Music Power-Up: Brad's Theme is one he recorded himself and you can see the speaker's he's playing it on to psyche himself up for his fight with Smiley.
- Thud and Blunder: Nanoc the Obliviator's world.
- The Unfought: Dr. Winklemeyer
- Took a Level in Jerkass: Smiley at the end of the game.
- Ungrateful Bastard: Girl: The Bradbots.
- Villainous Breakdown: Brad, at the end of the game. When Smiley goes to talk to him, he lost all his witty attitude and is suffering a massive depression, starting to write his own diary. Maybe that's because his Bradbots don't want him anymore and are now attracted to the Captain. It tells a lot about his real Casanova abilities but that's to be expected when you are humiliated by the Butt Monkey of the game.
- Well, being trapped in a Shoujo manga for three issues being a teacher when you were a super-villian in your previous job can break you down really bad.
- Vitriolic Best Buds: Captain Smiley and Star... possibly.
- What Kind of Lame Power Is Heart, Anyway?: Paper Lad, who's basically a sentient wad of paper than can turn into other types of paper.
- Smiley and Brad agree with this trope when they reach the Manga section.
- What the Hell, Hero?: The last stage. Wow.
- Where It All Began: The final level is a repeat of the first, but changed to be more awesome.
- Yandere: The girls of "Cutie Cutie Kid Cupids" don't take it kindly when Captain Smiley tries to take Brad away.
- Yaoi Fangirl: LoLo, the goth looking cupid. After thanking Smiley for defeating her two sisters, she proclaims she's going to write a super sexy yaoi starring Smiley and Star. They have no idea what she means by that.
- You Gotta Have Blue Hair: Gerda sports pink hair with her superhero outfit.
- Your Mom: She "loves Captain Smiley."5.11 Tactical® High - Visibility Parka

- 5.11 Tactical High - Visibility Parka is rated out of 5 by 1.Rated 4 out of 5 by Momknowsbest from Quality Construction, High Visibility. Lacking Fleece Liner. This parka is really well made. Perfect for those who work outside, or for use on a motorcycle to make other vehicles more aware and cautious. When you look at the Q & A, the reply is that a removable fleece liner is included. This is false. We received the "Parka" part, but no fleece liner. Very disappointing as the product is misrepresented. Somebody needs to get his/her facts straight. What we did receive is of excellent quality. Sure wish we had the "missing piece."Date published: 2015-03-26

Sexual Sites - Poem by Rm.Shanmugam Chettiar.
Women’s eyes will fall on man’s shoulders.
Men’s eyes will fall on woman’s breasts.
Man’s nose strikes woman and woman’s cheek, man.
They both fix their eyes on each other’s waist down.
Thus each enjoys harmless sex, front to front
In every gathering or meeting.

Seen while driving on Price road off Hy 16 inMoravian Falls. I TOOK it to be Sirius, as thats what it looked like. From my view point as i neared my home, it was CLEARLY HIGH in the sky ( hovering NO movement) , i focused on it, and just thought, my Sirius is QUITE brilliant tonight! Lost sight thru the trees, and as i rounded the last corner before i get to the house, i looked again and it was gone. As i pulled into the driveway, got out, i looked for Sirius, which was to the FAR RIGHT on the HORIZON. Now my Dad`s house is in line slight to right as i`m driving home on this particular stretch of road, this OBJECT was ""VERY"" High in the sky, and i would approximate it ( object)in my viewpoint to Dad`s house as being just to the LEFT of it and then vertical. I found ""SIRIUS"" it WAS too ""FAR FAR RIGHT"" on the Horizon and VERY LOW at that! , no way i could have mistaken it!! Height i would approx at 2000 feet. Anyone else see it??Go to Product Detail Page

There is no doubt 2004 will be remembered as the year reality TV faltered. But the failure of The Resort, and the poor performances of HotHouse, My Restaurant Rules and Popstars [Live] are not likely to bury the genre anytime soon.
Later this month Nine's The Block returns for its second season, and will be soon followed by a new American series The Apprentice, in which 16 aspiring suits compete under the supervision of tycoon Donald Trump. Both are widely anticipated to be among the strongest performing shows of the ratings year. And the strong market buzz for the fourth Big Brother and the second Australian Idol, coming soon on Ten, mean most level heads in the industry have refrained from writing an epitaph for reality TV too quickly.
In fact, with the benefit of hindsight, the poor dividends for this genre in early 2004 may only be a hiccup caused by the launch of too many shows, invariably perceived as clones or hybrids, something Australian audiences have shown a low tolerance for.
The Block, Australian Idol and Big Brother are widely regarded as "safe" brands with viewers. The Apprentice , while a new show, has the imprimatur of Trump and the production expertise of Survivor creator Mark Burnett.
The Apprentice has been the runaway hit of the year in the US and last week its ratings overtook CSI: Crime Scene Investigation in the coveted 18-49 demographic. It holds universal appeal, Burnett told the Herald, because anyone can relate to applying for a job, and being fired from one.
The series received 200,000 online applications, which were culled down to 1000 face-to-face auditions from which 16 finalists were drawn. One contestant is fired by Trump each week. The winner will run a Trump company for a year.
If The Block, The Apprentice, Big Brother and Australian Idol are successful it will help repair the perception that the genre is hemorrhaging and
restore audience and industry confidence, not just in reality TV, but in the programmers who have been backed into a corner, often second guessing themselves.

I have never understood why so many otherwise intelligent people think a data manipulation tool is a good place to STORE data.
Do you think Microsoft said to themselves "Excel is a perfectly secure place to store data so let us produce a totally unnecessary database called Access"?
Excel goes to extraordinary lengths to enable you to CHANGE data easily. A database does almost exactly the opposite.
I love Excel, it is my favourite thing, it is a fabulous analysis and reporting tool, I feel very lucky that people pay me to develop Excel solutions, so I beg you to listen to someone who knows more about Excel than you do: Excel is a very stupid place to store data.

WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Eight mail facilities on the campus of Howard University underwent precautionary testing Tuesday after the school's main mailroom tested positive for trace amounts of anthrax.
It is the first known case of anthrax contamination at a nongovernmental facility in the Washington area.
University spokeswoman Sheila Harvey says the mail sorting facilities were closed, and a private contractor was scheduled to be finished cleaning Tuesday.
Separate follow-up testing of those mailrooms is also ongoing, and results are expected back with the next 72 hours. Harvey said the rest of the campus remains open, and federal officials told Howard the contamination posed no health threat to the university community.
Harvey said one of 54 environmental samples at Howard tested positive over the weekend. None of the 300 mail-handling workers at Howard was believed to be at risk, since they had been on preventive antibiotics since October 21.
All eight mail facilities at Howard received mail directly from Washington's Brentwood Road mail-sorting facility, which closed because anthrax contamination from at least one letter was sent to the Capitol Hill office of Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle.
Four Brentwood employees developed inhalation anthrax, and two have died. Health officials earlier said the anthrax spores were largely confined to Brentwood's government mail sorting area, and it was unlikely nongovernmental customers would be at risk for infection.
Washington Mayor Anthony Williams and the city's health commissioner, Dr. Ivan Walks, met with Howard officials Tuesday. Walks praised the university's "proactive steps," saying the situation is contained and the community was not at risk.ECG Home

$cheme $tock - A Stock Market Visualization Application By Paul Ricker & Gary Kanter December 10, 2008
$cheme $tock is a web application that allows a user to view both current and historical stock data.
The application is composed of a web server written in scheme, middleware logic, written in scheme, which talks to the Yahoo! Finance API, and an Adobe Flex 3 application running in a web browser on the client side.
A user can select a range of dates in order to visualize a candlestick chart, which shows the range of intraday trading prices over the specified period of time. The application will also display a series of key financial data and ratios (like PE, Dividend Yield, % Change, etc) for the particular stock, based on the most recent market data.
$cheme $tock uses the following technologies:
Our project demonstrates how Scheme can be elegantly interfaced with cutting-edge technology like Adobe's Flex 3 Framework.
The project also demonstrates scheme's strength as a data processing middleware layer. Through the use of s-expressions scheme
can easily create xml documents describing custom data sets which can then be 'plugged' into modern web application frameworks in an almost trivial manner.
Our project also demonstrates how easily quality visualizations of data can be created with Adobe's Flex 3 framework. More importantly we also show how middleware layers written in scheme can actually further increase the productivity gains of such rapid application approaches because of scheme's ideal programming constructs for data representation and encoding, seen through the use of s-expressions.June 16, 2014 |

Jennifer Lawrence has denied she is taking a hiatus from Hollywood after movie mogul Harvey Weinstein suggested she planned to take a year-long break from acting.
The American Hustle star has enjoyed a series of successes thanks to her roles in The Hunger Games and X-Men franchises, as well as her Oscar-winning turn in Silver Linings Playbook, and Hollywood producer Weinstein recently hinted that she wants to take time off from her hectic work schedule.
He told Britain's The Sun on Sunday, "She."

One of the by-products of the sewage treatment process is biogas, produced during the anaerobic digestion process, which can be burned to provide heat and power.
Historically, the biogas created at Hayle has had high levels of hydrogen sulphide gas, which damages combined heat and power (CHP) engines. This year, the team fitted a gas scrubbing unit to reduce the amount of hydrogen sulphide in the biogas to prolong the life of the engines and upgraded the computer systems controlling the CHP process.
As a result, the three CHP engines on site now generate enough electricity to power the entire anaerobic digestion process and any surplus is exported to the National Grid. Between April 2012 and September 2013, the site generated a total of 454 MWh of electricity.
Another by-product of the treatment process is the aptly named 'sludge' - which when treated to produce a nutrient-rich organic matter called biosolids can be recycled on agricultural land as fertiliser.
In order to make biosolids suitable for local crops, sludge is treated with quicklime to destroy potential pathogens - but quicklime can be stinky, expensive and raise soil pH above the optimum level after repeated applications.
Instead, this summer the biosolids from the site have been recycled at a licensed and approved land restoration area in the china clay waste tips near St Austell.
As well as transforming a derelict wasteland to a green landscape, the team saved an estimated 1.8 tonnes of carbon dioxide by reducing the amount of quicklime quarried and transported.
And the good news for customers is that all this has been achieved without the nasty smells commonly associated with sewage treatment - over the summer there were only two odour complaints compared to 35 during the same period in 2011.
Operations Manager Mike Galligan said: "We were delighted to be recognised for the improvements we have made at Hayle Sewage Treatment Works.
"It just goes to show that even sewage can play its part in producing renewable energy and improving the local environment for everyone."
It's the second award in a row for the West team, who last year won the Low Carbon Business Award for energy use at Par Sewage Treatment Works at the same event.

The amount surpasses the 25 million-dollar profit reaped by the New Zealand Rugby Union for all revenues including broadcasting, attendance and sponsorship from the 2005 British and Irish Lions tour and makes the NZC deal the biggest broadcast windfall ever achieved by a national sport organisation.
According to Stuff.co.nz, NZC chief executive David White rejected any suggestion that the lucrative Indian tours will soon dry up and instead hinted that a scheduled visit by India again in 2019 would be confirmed within a matter of weeks along with tours by ‘all the big countries’.
White confirmed that broadcast rights for the present Indian tour were worth more than the then record 25 million dollars that NZC banked from India’s last visit in 2009 and the report mentioned that the deal is part of an eight-year international broadcast contract between NZC and global sports marketing agency Pitch International.
Struck in 2012, the report also said that the deal set to cover two Indian tours – the current 2014 visit and a return in 2019 which was scheduled under the ICC’s Future Tours Programme (FTP), although India has previously refused to sign up to the FTP, meaning the tour in four years time was no certainty.
White revealed broadcast rights from the current Indian tour and the scheduled 2019 visit represented 60 percent of NZ Cricket’s promised global broadcast revenue from Pitch International for the period of 2012 until 2020.
The 2014 tour profits are also much higher than 2009 despite the fact it was cut short by the Indians, with one Test and one Twenty20 game axed from the original itinerary, the report added. (ANI)

ABSTRACT
The internal surfaces of aluminum tubes, both unlined and lined with epoxy resin, which are used for packaged medicines such as creams, ointments, gels, etc., were evaluated chemically, and microbiologically with regard to microorganism adherence. Proof of porosity of the unlined aluminum surface and lined with epoxy resin, and the resistance to removal of the resin were observed using a scanning electron microscope and a stereoscope, with a digitalized image system. To evaluate the microorganisms adherence to the aluminum surface, unlined and lined with epoxy resin, sterilized disks (10mm in diameter) were immersed in Mueller Hinton Broth and placed in tubes of polypropylene with screw caps. The liquid culture medium was then inoculated with suspensions (109CFU/ml) of the following microorganisms: Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter lwoffii and Candida albicans and incubated at 37°C under constant agitation (100rpm) for 12 days. The culture broth was changed every 3 days, after which the disks were removed, and observed under the scanning electron microscope. Microscopic observations revealed adherence of the microorganisms and biofilm on the aluminum surfaces both unlined and lined with epoxy resin.
Key words: Microbial adherence, biofilm, biofouling, aluminum packaging.
INTRODUCTION
The benefical or non-benefical effects of the microorganisms on surfaces have been known for centuries. Guy de Chaulic first noted the effects of foreign bodies on the subsequent healing of wounds in the 14th century A. D.. The first detailed description of microbial adherence on surfaces was made by Zobell (19) and in 1970 the word biofilm was introduced into the scientific literature (9). Biofilms are defined as an accumulation of cells immobilized on a substratum in a matrix of extracellular polysaccharides of microbial origin (5).
The effects of microorganisms on surfaces is now almost universally accepted. There are many different types of surfaces preferred by microbes (9). The presence of biofilm on a surface can have many different types of effects, i.e. in the field of health where the quality of water is extremely important in industrial processing (9).
One of the detrimental effects of biofilms is that they can cause tooth decay, biocorrosion on metallic surfaces, and contamination of industrialized food and pharmaceutical products (3).
Walker et al. (18) concluded that no surface could be considered microbiologically clean. Microorganisms are present in water even in low numbers and can use a solid interface as a substratum for colonization. Lucas et al. (12) warned against the use of aluminum tubes as containers for medicines because of possible alterations, and Martindale (13) observed that on the aluminum lid used in containers for liquid medicines with sugar, a black polysaccharide formed. In 1988 Pozetti (16) observed that medicines in the form of gel could suffer alterations when packaged in aluminum tubes lined with epoxy resin.
According to the National Agency of Sanitary Vigilance (1) in RDC n° 33/2000, under the item "Labelling and Packaging", recipients for hand made medicines should guaranty physical and chemical properties, and microbiological stability. Tubes used in pharmaceutical packaging are usually made of 99.5% commercialy pure aluminum plus secondary substances such as ferric oxide, silicium, and titanium (16). The aluminum forms a passive layer of oxide on the surface, and as a consequence improves resistance to corrosion (7).
The aluminum used to produce tubes for pharmaceutical packaging have a smooth surface resulting from cold process lamination varying in thickness from 0.00635 to 0.200mm and possessing special characteristics resistant to destruction of the lining, toxicity, and porosity (2).
The objective of the present study was to evaluate, using chemical and microbiological methods, the behavior of commercially pure aluminum surfaces, both unlined and lined with epoxy resin to be used in the manufacture of tubes for the packaging of medicines for external use in alopathic, homeopathic or phitotherapic medicine.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Commercially pure aluminum unlined
To evaluate the porosity of the unlined aluminum surface, rectangular pieces of different sizes, were cut from unlined aluminum tubes before being filled with medicines, and then submitted to the action of a 5% (p/v) solution of mercury chloride for 5 minutes, according to CBE-Bandeirante de Embalagens Ltda (4).
Commercially pure aluminum lined with epoxy resin
To test the porosity of the epoxy resin lining the aluminum surface and the resistance to removal of the lining, rectangles of different sizes were cut from aluminum tubes lined with epoxy resin ready to receive the medicines. The samples were submitted to the action of a solution of 20% (v/v) ammonium hydroxide for 3 hours, followed by friction with cotton swabs for lining removal, according to instructions of CBE-Bandeirante de Embalagens Ltda (4).
Microbiological Evaluation
For microbiological evalutions of the unlined and lined aluminum surface with epoxy resin, disks of 10mm in diameter, were cut from the same tubes above mentioned.
The microorganisms Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus and Acinetobacter lwoffii were cultivated in Blood Agar and Candida albicans were cultivated in Sabouraud Dextrose Agar, all mediums used were from Difco (10). These microorganisms were chosen because they are isolated with facility from biological and industrial environments. Suspensions were made in a Brain Heart Infusion and incubated at 37°C until an optical density of 1.0 (540nm) was reached; 200µl of each cellular suspension (109UFC/ml) was used to inoculate 15ml of Mueller Hinton Broth. The metallic samples were autoclaved at 121°C for 15 min. and placed in 50ml polypropylene tubes [Corning] (8), containing 15ml of inoculated Mueller Hinton Broth, and incubated at 37°C under constant agitation of 100 revolutions per minute. The culture medium was changed every 3 days at 12 day intervals. After which the samples were removed from the liquid culture medium, prepared and examined using the scanning electron microscope (15).
Electron Microscope Procedures
The samples were immersed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1M phosphate buffer (pH 7.1) to fix the microorganisms, dehydrated in aqueous solutions of ethanol (15, 30, 50, 70, 95 and 100%) for 15 min. each one, and dried in a centrifuge under vacuum, then coated with gold and examined under the scanning electron microscope JEOL-JSM [T330A] (15).
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Samples of aluminum unlined and lined with epoxy resin, obtained from tubes used for packaging medicines, were submitted to chemical evaluation with regard to the porosity. The surface observed macroscopically showed the formation of an amalgam of aluminum on the epoxy resin lined surface, after treatment with 5% HgCl2. A chemical reaction was observed because the surface lined with epoxy resin was shown to be porous. The mercury chloride had reacted with the aluminum producing an alloy of mercury and aluminum easily observed. As a control aluminum samples without lining were used. According to the literature, porosity can be an undesirable factor, as the pores lead to stress and diminish mechanical resistence (14).
Regarding the proof of resistance to removal of the lining, a parcial removal of the resin was observed after an aluminum surface treatment with 20% ammonium hydroxide and friction with cotton swabs. This proof is used in order to verify the resin adherence on the aluminum surface.
In the present study, the physical surface of aluminum lined with epoxy resin was observed using the Leica (MZ12) stereoscope microscope showing an invasion of the external lining as well as flaws in the internal lining. Sharp points of aluminum and flaws in application of the resin were also noted, according to Pozetti (17).
The tubes of aluminum used in pharmaceutical packaging can at times show defects such as: internal or external dirt, foreign bodies, or deformed tubes, extremities of tubes either deformed or torn; breaks in the body of the tube when pressed, and other defects in production. On the internal lining following alterations can occur: high porosity, low adherence or elasticity of the resin, high solubility in acetone; low resistance to ammonia and acetic acid; the resin can also be rough, and non uniform. The interior resin could be contaminated by the exterior coating, and thus transfer particles of grease or oil into the product, according to CBE- Bandeirante de Embalagens Ltda. (4).
Bacterial adherence and biofilm formation on a commercially pure aluminum surface, lined with epoxy resin, was observed after samples incubation in Mueller Hinton Broth inoculated with Streptococcus agalactiae (Fig. 1), Candida albicans (Fig. 2), Staphylococcus aureus (Fig. 3), and on an unlined surface, Acinetobacter lwoffii (Fig.4), Staphylococcus aureus (Fig. 5) and Candida albicans (Fig. 6).
The microbiological evaluations observed using scanning electron microscope showed that the surface lined with epoxy resin, attracted a microbial colonization (Figs 1-3) and also, according to Montanaro, Arciola (14), and Pizzolitto et al. (15), the microorganisms seemed to have a preference for irregular or porous surfaces. These types of surfaces furnish niches in which the microorganisms can attract, stick to, and grow in microcolonies forming biofilms. It was also observed there was a microbial adherence on unlined aluminum surfaces (Figs. 4-6). Our results coincide with those of other researcher (12) who disapprove the use of aluminum tubes even those which are lined, due the fact that the contents prepared using plants such as hamamelis, aromatic chamomile, eucalyptus, etc., are incompatible with metallic salts, including those of aluminum. Aluminum can also form inumerous complexes of all the groups, both soluble and insoluble. Aluminum can precipitate Ag, Cu, Hg, Sn, Sb, Cd, etc., by reduction (6). According to Lucas (12) aluminum is incompatible with mercury salts, and in general with alkalis, alkaline carbonates, acid and acids salts in general. In reference to tubes manufactured using aluminum lined with epoxy resin Clark et al. (7) observed that this resin is incompatible with vegetable oils, gums, resins, and cellulosic polymer. Pozetti (17) recommended that the metallic tubes should not be used as recipients for products used in oral hygiene, homeopathic, alopathic and phitotherapic medicines. According to Ferreira (11) pharmaceutical packaging should be clean, and non interact physically or chemically with the contents. The quality and purity of the preparation, must be preserved and should be paint resistant, protecting the contents from the action of light, as well as being tightly closed to avoid external contamination. Our results showed that aluminum both unlined and lined with epoxy resin used for packaging pharmaceutical products permit microbial adherence.

RESUMO
Avaliação química e microbiológica da superfície interna dos tubos de alumínio não revestido e revestido com resina epóxi por meio de microscópio estereoscópio e eletrônico de varredura
A superfície interna das bisnagas fabricadas com alumínio não revestido e revestido com resina epóxi, utilizadas para acondicionar cremes, pomadas, géis, etc., foram avaliadas quimicamente e por métodos microbiológicos correlacionados com a aderência de microrganismos. A prova da porosidade e da resistência à remoção da resina foi observada por meio do microscópio eletrônico de varredura (Topcon FM300) e estereoscópio Leica (MZ12) acoplado a Sistema de Digitalização de Imagens. Para avaliar a ação dos microrganismos foram utilizados corpos-de-prova esterilizados (discos de 10mm de diâmetro), imersos em caldo Mueller Hinton (Difco) e colocados em tubos de polipropileno com tampa de rosca (Corning). Foram inoculados tubos com meio de cultura para cada uma das suspensões bacterianas (109UFC/mL) de Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter lwoffii e Candida albicans, incubados a 37°C, sob agitação constante durante 12 dias. O meio de cultura era trocado a cada 3 dias. Após esse período, os corpos-de prova foram removidos, processados e observados em microscópio eletrônico de varredura JEOL-JSM (T330A). A observação por meio do microscopio eletrônico de varredura mostrou a aderência e a formação de biofilme sobre a superfície de alumínio não revestido e revestido com resina epóxi.

I have often liked theme shows that galleries put together for groups of artist with specific guidelines and the challenges that they pose for the artists involved. On the other hand, I have found some of these group shows so confining that even very creative people find it difficult to bring off a successful response to the challenge. There have been many winners and losers over the years. The Albuquerque miniature show has always been a great one and I find the latest example of this type gallery event at Zane Bennett to be another winner.
For their annual group show, Zane Bennett has asked its artists to express their concepts for "A Square Foot of Humor" in 12 x 12 inch works.
One would think that the confines of a one-foot square might be too limiting for even a solid group of artists. Add to that the moniker of “humor” and the challenge increases. The Zane Bennett artists have quite stepped up to the challenge and the range of the work is remarkable.
Featuring the works of Roger Atkins, Dunham Aurelius, Stephen Buxton, Susan Davidoff, Engels, Matthew Troy Mullins, Ron Pokrasso, Heidi Pollard, Holly Roberts, Joshua Rose, Rachel Stevens, Donald Woodman, Denise Yaghmourian and Karen Yank, the show opens with an artists’ reception on Friday, November 30 from 5. to 7 p.m. and runs through January 8.
What makes us laugh? Some say that humor is a surprise without a threat or promise. Artist Roger Atkins offers us an unmarked box on the wall to open. Inside we read a multitude of opening lines to some of the artist's favorite jokes. If we are open to a laugh, we no doubt will try to finish the joke!
This is just one of the wonderfully unique responses to this show’s concept. The range of work from this extraordinary stable of gallery artists is packed with inch upon inch of skill, sensibility and, yes, humor.
You are invited to enjoy the therapeutic effects of laughter for yourself. Go see ZBCA's version of foolery in “A Square Foot of Humor.”

While electric bikes require less energy to ride than a conventional bike, they’re no less beneficial for your health according to recent studies. The main reason why electric bikes, or ebikes, are just as beneficial for your health is because you’re more likely to use them regularly than traditional bikes. Plus, even though ebikes have a motor, you still need to peddle if you want to go faster than 4.5mph.
If you’re recovering from an injury or have a long-term problem – such as bad knees – that means you can’t ride a conventional bike, you might find that an ebike allows you to ride without experiencing any discomfort. Plus, asides from the health benefits, electrical bicycles are much more environmentally-friendly than cars, motorbikes and public transport, and because they’re still classed as bicycles under UK law, you can feel free to use bike lanes and cut through traffic.
However, just like ordinary bikes without a motor, there are many different types of electronic bike available, and you need to take care to purchase such a product from a reputable supplier. The best manufacturers offer fantastic warranties on their products, and you ought to look for one that covers parts such as the motor and battery for two years. Below, this article takes a look at some of the most popular types of electric bike available to help you buy an electric bike in Yorkshire that’s right for you.
Finding the Most Ideal Electric Bike
As long as you buy the most appropriate type of electric bike for your needs, you can feel confident that your investment will be worthwhile. Here are some of the most popular types:
- Bikes meant for city travelling – Electric bikes manufactured for city travelling tend to be the most lightweight, and the motor will usually be visible rather than hidden. If you only intend to use your bike for traversing relatively unchallenging terrain to get to work and back, this is probably your best option.
- Bikes purposed for tough terrain – You might think electric bikes could never be used for the likes of mountains and steep slopes, but many electric bikes are actually designed with this kind of activity in mind. The motor and battery will usually be protected and hidden out of view, and when you’re feeling tired, you’ll be glad to have the motor assist you to tackle tough terrain.
- Foldaway bikes – Perhaps your biggest concern is how you’re going to store your electric bike, and if saving space is a priority, you won’t regret buying a foldaway product.
You’ll Adore Your New Bike
If you buy an electric bike that’s ideal for your particular needs, you’ll love cycling with the assistance of a battery powered motor for years to come. Just make sure you buy a product from a company you can trust. Heart Association State-of-the-Art Stroke Nursing Symposium; New Orleans, LA;

I am a fan of e-readers, and e-ink. I’ve had a Kindle for just over a year, and I’ve read about 75 books on it (including several public domain titles). That said, I’m not entirely averse to the idea of Barnes & Noble’s Nook Color—at least, not yet. After all, an e-reader with a color screen, cheaper and less
functional than the iPad has uses, not the least of which are well-rendered textbooks and kids’ books. Yet Barnes & Noble’s latest gadget is still under threat from said iPad and Amazon’s Kindle—a threat that would be largely diminished if it would spend less time spinning, and more time reading.
Successfully marketing e-readers is different to successfully marketing a book. In book marketing, readers are presented with information about an author, a plot, and the type of readers who’ll enjoy said book, tying into reading preferences. And it works: chances are, if you’re a fan of the Percy Jackson series, you’ll be a fan of the Gods in Manhattan one; if you like the Stephanie Plum books, you might like Women’s Murder Club , a fact both Amazon and Barnes & Noble make use of in their e-newsletters (though, surprisingly, not at the end of an e-book). Marketing an e-reader, though, is about marketing the way we read, about marketing an experience. And that’s where Barnes & Noble could win..
Picking an actor to play the film version of a much loved literary figure is hard work. Finding the perfect match isn’t solely about matching a book, but matching the zeitgeist a wildly popular book creates. Generally speaking, though, to clearly buck the physical description of a character is to enter dangerous waters, particularly in light of last year’s whitewashing scandal.
Although it may sound like little more than a cheap paint job, whitewashing is a real—and insidious—problem in the publishing world. Driven by the perception that covers with black, Hispanic, or Asian (read: non-white) faces don’t sell books, several publishers, most notably Bloomsbury USA, have released covers with white models representing non-white protagonists. Worse, the majority of the whitewashed covers are on young adult books, targeting a demographic already sensitive to issues of identity and belonging.

Published February 18, 2007 held since Hurricane Katrina struck.
"It's great, isn't it?" said Kelly Schulz, a spokeswoman for the New Orleans Convention and Visitors Bureau. "This is a very big deal."
Parades are planned each day, leading to Fat Tuesday. Some paradegoers began staking out prime spots to see the elaborate processionals and perhaps even glimpse a celebrity.
The Krewe of Endymion, one of Carnival's best known groups, was set to march Saturday afternoon with American Idol winner Taylor Hicks in the lead. The salt-and-pepper-haired singer was to perform later that evening with Al Green and Journey at Endymion's sold-out ball at the Superdome.
Hicks said he got a little advice from krewe members about what to do with the beads: "They told me to throw them 'til it hurts," he said. "Which is what I plan on doing."
Other celebrities set to participate in weekend parades included actor James Gandolfini and members of the New Orleans Saints football team..

Today, Deb Caletti, author of He’s Gone, shares a special family sugar cookie recipe with us. We are hungry just reading the recipe, and you will be, too! This seems like a perfect sweet treat to have around throughout the holidays as guests come and go. Thanks for sharing, Deb!
While these are a favorite cookie of ours for the holidays, whenever you’re in dire need of five gajillion instantly-satisfying fat calories, these are the cookies for you. This recipe has been quelling cookie longing in my family for many years – the original is written in my grandmother’s handwriting on the back of an envelope, which is now frail and taped together and thoroughly splotched with ingredients as a good recipe should be. Unless you want to be eating dough and making cookies all day (and we do have those days), then I’d suggest halving the recipe. Snitching a few of these with a cup of coffee on Thanksgiving morning will start the day off right.
Mom’s Sugar Cookies
Cream together:
1C. powdered sugar
1C. granulated sugar
1C. butter
Add:
1C. oil
2 eggs, beaten
2 tsp. vanilla
5 C. flour

FAQ's: Answers
How does the sleeve stay in the cylinder?
Cylinder sleeves are typically installed into the cylinder using an "interference fit" (sometimes referred to as "press fit"). This means the size of the block or cylinder bore is smaller than the outside diameter of the sleeve. The sleeve is "pressed" into the cylinder and the size variance holds the sleeve in place. Generally, the interference fit for the sleeve to a cast iron bore is .0025". And for aluminum bore the interference fit is .004".

Do you make a sleeve for my engine?
Yes. Most likely, L.A.SLEEVE produces the sleeve you need. We have over 4,000 sleeve part numbers, ranging for 50 years of models and industries. If you do not see the model in one of our six catalogs our sales and technical staff will be happy to assist you to locate a sleeve that fulfills your requirements.
top
What wall thickness do you recommend?
We make three standard wall thickness sleeves. 1/16" (.0625"), 3/32" (.093"), 1/8" (.125").
Determine your wall thickness by the application required or the cylinder block. Generally, the most popular wall thickness sleeve is 3/32". This size allows oversize bores, while maintaining the strength of most cylinder blocks.
The method for determining wall thickness is:
Outside diameter minus(-) inside diameter divided by 2 = thickness.
For example: 2.375" O.D. - 2.125" I.D. = .250" divided by 2 = .125" (1/8") wall thickness
top
What material are your sleeves made from?
L.A.SLEEVE manufactures our cylinder sleeves from a centrifugally spun cast iron alloy of carbon-chrome and molybdenum..
L.A.SLEEVE also manufactures ductile iron sleeves and spun cast aluminum sleeves.
top
Do you install sleeves into cylinders there at L.A.SLEEVE?
L.A.SLEEVE does install cylinder sleeves into small engine type applications such as: motorcycle, watercraft, ATV, snowmobile, kart, compressor and industrial engines. Call our re-sleeve department for a quotation. Generally, this service takes about 10-14 days turn around time.
Check the "
Re-Sleeve Your Cylinder
" area in the Tech section for shipping procedures (download the Cylinder Department - Job Order Form).
L.A.SLEEVE will bore your cylinder to accept the new sleeve, match all the ports to the cylinder, slightly deck the top of the cylinder if required, bore and hone the cylinder to accept the new piston and supply all the required top end piston kits, gaskets and bearings to complete the cylinder rebuild.
top
Do the ports in your two-stroke sleeve match closely the ports in the cylinder?
Very close! Each two-stroke sleeve part number is precision designed and machined to match the designated model and cylinder. Wherever possible the sleeve is machined with the matching angles, bevels, and chamfers so that only minimal port blending is required. L.A.SLEEVE pioneered the technique of two-stroke sleeve manufacturing and is the leader in design, application and availability. We stock and supply more two-stroke sleeves than any other manufacturer.
Caution: If you should receive a sleeve that does not appear to match your cylinder porting it is likely to be the wrong model. Do not install the sleeve until consulting with our technical staff..
top
When I install the sleeve do I need to freeze the sleeve before installation?
No. But, some rebuilders like to cool the sleeve. The belief is that the sleeve will shrink slightly to make installation easier. Caution! If the difference between the temperature of the block and sleeve is too great a crack may result in the block.
top
Once the sleeve is installed, do I need to bore the sleeve to fit the piston into the cylinder?
Yes. All sleeves are supplied with a semi-finish bore. The piston will not fit until you have bored the sleeve to the correct piston clearance. Hone the bore to the clearance recommended by the piston manufacturer.
top
What is the recommended interference fit of the sleeve to the block?
Sleeve to a cast iron bore - .0025"
Sleeve to aluminum bore - .004"
top
Should I bore my cylinder or block before I receive the sleeve?
It is recommended that you measure the outside diameter of the sleeve before you begin any machine work. A little patience will pay off in the long run.
top
What type of equipment do I need in order to install a sleeve?
1. Boring bar. There are various brands from which to choose.
2. Oven. Heating the cylinder is recommended when installing a sleeve.
3. Measuring tools. Accurate micrometers are essential.
4. Hone. The bore should be honed to size the piston clearance.
5. Porting tools. Two stroke cylinders require port chamfering.

Cambria
Cambria county, Pennsylvania: & Indiana RR passenger train was robbed of a payroll destined for the Colver Coal Mine amounting to $33,000. The train was stopped, as it was about to cross the concrete bridge outside Belsano and the robbers dragged the safe from the express car to a getaway car parked near the RR tracks. The robbers were captured 2 weeks later and 2 of the men, Michelo Bassi and Anthony Pezzi, were convicted of murder and died in the electric chair. Not all of the money or the safe was ever found and some sources believe that it remains hidden in the area of the robbery site.
Cambria county, Pennsylvania: Included in the treasure lost in the Johnstown flood of 1889 was the metal safe from the local bank containing $50,000. It was never found
Centre
Centre county, Pennsylvania: The area banks gathered up their gold deposits and placed them in 6 barrels. The treasure was loaded aboard a wagon train headed for Clearfield, some 40 miles to the N, but because of the rugged terrain the caravan took a more circular route, NE to Wingate and then to Snow Shoe Mountain. The wagon train stopped for the night at Mountain House, a tavern and inn on the summit of the mountain. The next morning the 6 barrels of gold were missing and no trace of the hoard has ever come to light.
Centre county, Pennsylvania: The outlaws Lewis and Conley frequently attacked travelers along Drover’s Road, also known as the Great Shamokin Indian Path. The outlaw David Lewis was arrested and imprisoned at Bellefonte in 1820 where he died of wounds received during his capture. Before his death he swore that he had buried a fortune in gold within sight of the jail
Centre County, Pennsylvania: During the Revolutionary War, soldiers secreted several bags of gold coins in Penns Cave, 6 miles NE Spring Mills. There have been no reports of any recovery of this cache.
Centre County, Pennsylvania: Woodward Cave was the hideout of a band of outlaws in the 1820’s, located N of Woodward on Pine Creek. Stories have persisted that loot of this gang remains hidden or buried in the area and has yet to be recovered.
Chester
Chester County, Pennsylvania: the Fitzgerald outlaw gang had a hideout in a cave in the mountains near Brandywine in the area of Hands Pass. The bandits robbed several farmers and taverns in the region and rumors of their having buried loot in or near the cave have circulated for many years.
Chester County, Pennsylvania: An unnamed old man died in the S part of Chester County shortly after the Revolutionary War. He had served as an informant for the British and had received gold coins in payment, which he buried in a crock somewhere near his hut. He told of the treasure cache on his deathbed but did not give enough details to afford any recovery and the gold coins were never recovered.
Clearfield
Clearfield County, Pennsylvania: A trapper in the late 1700’s had a secret lead and silver mine somewhere in the vicinity of his cabin at the junction of Morgan Run and Little Clearfield Creek near Stoneville. Rich ore was found in his cabin after his death, but the source remains to be found.
Clearfield County, Pennsylvania: There have been stories told for years by old-timers in the Woodland area that a cache of treasure is buried somewhere along the trail between Indian Rock and Long Run on the Woodland side of Missionary Ridge. In 1914, the old Lambert homestead was located along Clearfield Creek, 2 miles S of Dimeling. He buried a butter crock full of pennies somewhere on his property that has never been recovered after his death.
Clinton
Clinton county, Pennsylvania: Around 1835, a man named Groves witnessed a group of Indians from the Thomas Burns house, on the W branch of the Susquehanna River 2 or 3 miles above Keating, find a rich store of silver ore within a day’s trip upstream from the house. Following their tracks, Groves found that they ended at Birch Island Run, but searches in the area failed to locate the Indian silver mine at this site. It is believed that the silver deposit is located somewhere between Birch Island Run and Spruce Run
Clinton county, Pennsylvania: A priceless piece of American history is located at old Fort Horn. On July 4, 1776, the Pine Creek Declaration of Independence was signed near Hersey Shore under an ancient tree, placed in a heavy, iron box, and buried in the middle of the parade grounds at the fort. In 1778, the fort was burned to the ground during a Tory reprisal. In 1779, when a search was made for the box, located on an elevation on the bend of the Susquehanna River between present-day Pine Station and McElhattan, it could not be found and has remained lost ever since.
Columbia
Columbia county, Pennsylvania: A farmer reportedly buried a cache of gold coins near an old covered bridge crossing Roaring Creek NW of Mill Grove. He failed to tell his family the exact location before he died and the treasure was never recovered
Cumberland
Cumberland county, Pennsylvania: The early 1800’s outlaw, robber and highwayman David Lewis is known to have buried a cache of loot and valuables along Conodoguinet Creek W of Carlisle. This location was his first known hideout. Another cache of treasure attributed to David Lewis is believed located on the old farm owned by his parents near Carlisle. Carlisle served as the main military base in the state during the French and Indian War and the jumping-off place for pioneers heading west.
I know of a metal safe in johnstown. Very old. It sits in a underground passage. I would like someone to contact me or if anyone has interest. Please message me @ escoesco48@gmail.com thx
I am the discoverer of new silver strikes in southern Lancaster County Pa in 2012. I am Christopher L. Haefner, the 14-year-old in 1974 who rediscovered rich, thick strikes of silver in the abandoned Pequea silver mine and wrote about it in 2009 in "The Silver! Mine!" The new-found strikes promise to yield in the tens of thousands of dollars!
We have a hunting camp near Snow Shoe Mountain, I think i should look for that treasure some time ;)
I had no idea so many people were burying little treasures in PA. lol. <br />
Where do you find such stories? <br />
The six (6) barrels of gold owned by the banks being transported....I wouldn't be surprised if the bankers robbed it themselves... did they have insurance back then? Bankers were thieves even back then. <br />
<br />
And then there is my favorite treasure story.....<br />
"........a butter crock full of pennies somewhere on his property that has never been recovered after his death". Priceless.
it's me again-want to hear some more of your storiet hink pennsylvania would be great-have a nice day.
I know, I would love to just get out and wander the Hills of PA to look for some of this stuff. I have plenty of stories left to post over the next couple of weeks.
Damn I wanna go digging around Pennsylvania!Facebook messages are shedding light on the final hours before a South Miami man allegedly shot his wife and posted a photo of her body on the social networking site.

Prescribed burning in Jocassee Gorges targets ecosystem restoration
Many species and ecosystems require fire periodically to ensure their survival, and that’s why prescribed burns have been a part of the S.C. Department of Natural Resources’ management of the Jim Timmerman Natural Resources Area at Jocassee Gorges in northern Pickens and Oconee counties.
People in the upstate have seen smoke signals emerging from the mountaintops north of SC Highway 11 in Pickens County for the last few years. Controlled, or prescribed, burning is a common practice in the Lowcountry, but the S.C. Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has applied fire science and principles to roughly 5,000 acres in the mountains as well.
“The objective of the prescribed burns is to maintain the ecological integrity of these lands,” said Mark Hall, DNR wildlife biologist, forester and Jocassee Gorges land manager, “and to provide for human safety by reducing the amount of fuel, thereby reducing the chance of catastrophic wildfire. For many of these ecosystems, it’s not a matter of 'if' they will burn, but rather 'when.' We like to choose the 'when'.”
Burning has been done when the weather was suitable to allow for a safe burn, including the rapid rising and dispersal of smoke, Hall said. Once weather conditions are right for the burn, it takes four to 10 hours for the active burning to be completed, although scattered stumps, logs and dead trees may smolder slowly through the night. Burn areas are surrounded by fire breaks, which include existing roads, streams, plowed fire breaks and hand lines put in with rakes and shovels in sensitive areas.
“Over eons of time, many native plants, animals and habitats in the southeastern United States have adapted to the presence of recurring fire,” Hall said. “Many species and ecosystems are now rare because of fire suppression over the last century or so. Those systems actually need fire to ensure their survival. We’ve burned about 5,000 acres since 2004 to help restore natural processes.”
Hall emphasized that since prescribed burning requires careful timing and a thorough knowledge of weather and fire behavior, highly trained fire personnel with the DNR and S.C. Forestry Commission manage and conduct all aspects of the controlled burns.
“Besides the ecological benefits of prescribed fire, it also has the added benefit of reducing fuel on the forest floor and lessening the chances of a catastrophic fire, which can threaten homes and people,” Hall said.
“Because fire has been suppressed for so long in some places, you get dangerous buildups of fuel and increase the chances for a wildfire that can destroy property and lives. The wildfires we’ve seen across the United States in the last 15 years, due in large part to past fire suppression, underscore the need for prescribed fire.”
By using a prescribed burn—when wind, temperature and humidity conditions are appropriate to remove some of the forest fuel like leaves, pine needles and twigs—fire managers can greatly reduce the chances of a catastrophic wildfire. After controlled burns are completed, the homes and properties close to Jocassee Gorges will be much less likely to be in the path of a wildfire, because the fuel is reduced or eliminated.
“Some people become upset when there is smoke in the air they don’t know the reason for the fire,” Hall said. “We’ve been getting the word out about prescribed fire to our neighbors in the community. If we carefully plan and conduct a burn when weather conditions favor smoke dispersal, this reduces smoke-related problems. Dealing with a little bit of smoke now is infinitely better than trying to control a raging wildfire later.”
Since 2004, fire has been used every two to three years in the pine woodlands along the Shooting Tree Road, where visitors may enter off Cleo Chapman Highway in Eastatoee Valley. Fire has also been applied every three to four years in the woodlands adjacent to the Horsepasture Road, deep within Jocassee Gorges. The burned sites are on the south side of the main road, about 5 miles in from the Laurel Valley Entrance off US Highway 178. Visitors are encouraged to observe the difference in the vegetation in those areas. The change in the plant composition in the woodlands is quite noticeable, especially to songbirds, black bear and wild turkey that might be seen in those areas. Many of the plants that volunteer after fire is applied offer key components to the habitat those animals depend upon.

The mod is gearing up for it's first release, as well as other big news!
Posted by KojaK on Oct 10th, 2012
So I realize that I said in the last podcast that I'd post an update after I got back from the meetup, and while I fully intended to do that, a lot of stuff hit all at once.
So first and foremost, the meetup went fantastic. The mod was very well received and everyone was excited to see what was next. However, possibly the biggest news I have is what happened next: I'm now not the only person working on the project. On top of Goldendeed (who made the map look amazing), I now have AndyM84 helping me with the code. He's actually developed games in the past and has literally more than double the experience I have with programming. We spent quite a lot of time going over the code and moving it all over onto his servers.
So on to the next order of business, the status of the mod:
As of right now, it's still in the testing phase. So barring any major bugs or problems (which is still a serious possibility) the mod will be released in a couple of weeks. I'll explain what 'alpha' means in this context since developers often throw around the terms 'alpha version' and 'beta version' a lot:
For this project, alpha means the mod is playable in the sense that it meets the description I set: you can collect resources, build and defend a camp, and survive against zombies. However, it is nowhere near 'feature complete', which means all the features I want to add are in. The project will reach a "beta" stage when all the features I want are in, such as a full tech tree, traps, and much more.
I feel it's important to mention that again, not everything is in the mod yet!
There is quite a lot in the mod already though, such as a full AI director, control over your survivors, dynamic resources scattered around the map, ways to interact with the map using your resources, and the ability to construct barriers wherever needed (which will be used later on for the full base building mechanic).
I'll leave everyone with a few shots of me playing through the map. If you'd like to get information about the mod as soon as we know, follow us on twitter, @ZombieColony.
^_^
However, I managed to fight them off and repair the broken barricade
Zombies did make it inside sadly, though the medic and her patient were fine.
I did a bit of exploring to gather up supplies, and to get rid of zombies on the rooftops
Cleared out the zombies from the fountain area...
And then finally made it to the gas station!
Unfortunately, I found that I ignored too many cries of "zombies!" and when I returned I found everyone dead. So a word of warning, survivors can hold out, but not for long without your help! hella fun, that's for sure.
this looks great
I can't wait to dl this
Too much too much! lol this looks GREAT! I can't wait.
I've been following this, but forgot to track. I cannot wait! Looks amazing!

GOP To Propose Obamacare For Seniors
Forbes
Despite the Republican propensity to compare the Affordable Care Act to something akin to the antichrist, word is that GOP budget leader, Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI), will propose a dramatic change in the Medicare program that will closely mirror the key features of Obamacare – only for seniors.
The proposal would do away with (for everyone presently under 55 years of age) the current single payer government system for senior medical care and replace it with a program whereby seniors would choose private health insurance coverage from a menu of approved private health insurers. The government would subsidize the program by giving seniors a voucher to be used in purchasing coverage, the amount of such payment to be defined according to need.
Does any of this sound familiar?
While the terminology may be different, it seems particularly reasonable to assume that the word “menu” is code for “health care exchange”. And while the word “voucher” plays well with the GOP base, it is really no different from the subsidies the ACA will pay to those under 65 who purchase health insurance.
Unfortunately, while Ryan has emulated a number of features from the ACA, he’s forgotten to make the adjustments the law makes to actually ensure that health care is more accessible to beneficiaries rather than more profitable to health insurance companies.
Making private insurance work for the younger demographics is far easier than trying to make it work for the elderly due to the most basic tenet of health insurance – the insurance pool must be balanced by having 80 healthy people in the pool to pay for every 20 who are ill.
Given that most Americans 65 and older are a walking pre-existing medical condition, it is difficult to imagine how functioning insurance pools can be constructed from a universe filled with these people. It is equally hard to see how health insurers could offer such a plan without severely restricting the benefits offered or, in the alternative, charging very large premiums – unless the government is prepared to put large enough subsidy checks in the pockets of the insurers to cover the extra costs.

Rep. Anthony Weiner: Speaker Boehner Is Being Held Hostage By The Tea Party!
Rep. Anthony Weiner of NY is one of a very few Democrats who will openly speak out against the Tea Party Republicans in the House. Many people think he’s a joke.
As a fellow New Yorker (now living in the south), I know better. Yes, Weiner gets excited and animated when he speaks, (it’s a New York thing) but I’m certain it’s due to his frustration in getting people, particularly complacent Dems, to really hear what he has to say. If I were them, I’d listen to what Rep. Weiner is saying.

The show, which will end with a two-hour special on a Saturday sometime in November, has brought us many memorable moments over the years, from teenyboppers screaming in Times Square to celebrity highs and, uh, lows (three words: Mariah Carey, Popsicles). I was never the most devoted viewer of TRL, but it definitely had a place in my late-high school, early-college years, alongside Dawson's Creek and Blind Date.
As the show winds down, I'm wondering about your memories of TRL. Were you a frequent viewer, or did you tune in only when you were interested in the guests? Do any TRL moments stand out in your mind? And did you ever (totally) request anything live?

How hungry is Gerrits? He's started to eat his competitors. Just look at the Vine he posted:
His "victim" is fellow freestyle skier Lydia Lassila, a three-time Olympian from Australia, who won the gold in aerials in 2010.
She survived the incident enough to tweet about it, although she could just be firing off 140-character missives while skiing inside around Gerrits. You know, like when Pinocchio was swallowed by that whale.
If a bunch of freestyle skiers go missing in Russia and Travis Gerrits has a toothpick in his mouth every time you see him, then you know something is up.

Last week’s analysis of the daily technical studies suggested that it would take several consecutive days on the downside to generate sell signals and therefore indicate a deeper correction.
The strong market internals, Tuesday, have moved the A/D lines higher and they could easily break out to the upside with another strong close on Wednesday. If instead we close lower, it will keep the recent trading range intact. The Nasdaq 100 continues to lead on the upside gaining 1.9% and the Dow Transports also outpaced the S&P 500 as I still like stocks in this sector.
Over the holidays, I came across an article Look Who’s on Top Now from last summer by Mark Hulbert. The article focused on the Motley Fool as three of their advisory services had led his five-year performance rankings through June 30, of 2013.
All three of the services follow a fundamentally-based buy-and-hold strategy and typically hold their position for three to five years. I have found that those stocks favored by fundamental analysts are often worth watching as bullish technical signals can help improve the entry levels.
In the article, there were six stocks that had been recently added to their winning portfolios and they have done quite well over the past six months. Since the opening on August 5 (the first day of trading after the article was released), the six picks are showing an average gain of 30.9%. So how do their charts look now?
Chart Analysis: Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY) is a $5.69 billion dollar biopharmaceutical company that focuses on therapeutics based on RNA interference. The stock spiked to a high of $112.50, Monday, on news that Sanofi Sanofi (SNY) had taken a 12% stake and bought access to one of its rare-disease treatments.
- The stock hit a low of $85 on Tuesday with the quarterly projected pivot resistance even lower at $79.95.
- The weekly resistance at $28.50 (line a) was surpassed in May (point 1), and by October, ALNY had doubled.
- The correction in the middle of November tested the 20-week EMA (point 2), which is now at $61.15.
- The relative performance confirmed the May breakout as it overcame the resistance at line b.
- The RS line shows a clear pattern of higher highs as it has been a market leader.
- The weekly on-balance volume (OBV) also overcame its resistance, line c, in May.
- The OBV looks ready to make further new highs this week as volume has been heavy.
- There is good support for the OBV at line e and the rising WMA.
- ALNY is up 83.4% since the August 5th open.
CaesarStone Sdot-Yam Ltd CaesarStone Sdot-Yam Ltd. (CSTE) is an Israel-based provider of general building materials. It was up 20% the week after the article was published. The stock hit a high last week of $53.99.
- CSTE dropped back to the early August lows in late October (point 3) as the 20-week EMA was violated.
- The relative performance broke out to the upside in July as it surged through resistance at line g.
- The RS line dropped back to its WMA in November and did make marginal new highs last week.
- The weekly OBV started to surge last summer and then pulled back to its WMA before the Aspray’s OBV Trigger (AOT) flipped back to positive in the first week of November.
- The OBV made further new highs last week as it is leading prices higher.
- The first good support is now at $45.98 and the quarterly pivot.
- CSTE is up 46.2% since early August.
Halliburton Halliburton (HAL) is one of the most familiar stocks on their recommended list as it reached its weekly starc+ band on November 15 with a high of $56.36. It is currently down over 10% from this high.
- HAL has been below its quarterly pivot of $51.65, so far in 2014, and is testing the weekly uptrend,
line a.
- There is support next at $48.71 with the quarterly projected pivot support at $46.95.
- The relative performance did confirm the November highs but dropped below its WMA three weeks after the highs.
- The RS line is getting closer now to its long-term support at line b.
- The daily RS line (not shown) violated its WMA one day after the highs and is now trying to bottom out.
- The weekly OBV is trying to stay above its WMA and it did confirm the recent highs.
- The OBV has next key support at the mid-December lows and then the uptrend, line c.
- HAL is up just 9.8% since August.
Liberty Global Liberty Global CL A (LBTYA) is a $35.1 billion cable TV company that is based in the United Kingdom.
- The stock broke out above the August high at $82.50 seven weeks ago and hit $90.93 on Monday.
- The monthly projected pivot resistance is at $93.62 with the weekly starc+ band at $94.25.
- There is initial support now at $87-$87.50 with the quarterly pivot at $84.39.
- The weekly uptrend, line d, is now at $79.50 and the tests of this support last fall were good buying opportunities.
- The relative performance broke its downtrend, line e, at the end of November.
- The daily RS analysis (not shown) is positive and is confirming the price action.
- The weekly OBV has made marginal new highs over the past six months but is not far above the support at line h.
What It Means: The other stocks that the article noted had recently been added to their portfolios were Urban Outfitters Inc. (URBN), down 15.4%, and Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO), which is up 48.4%.
I do often look at fundamental buy lists as Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY) and CaesarStone Sdot-Yam Ltd. (CSTE) were not previously on my radar. Following the technical signals can often optimize your entry point in those stocks favored by fundamental analysts. All of the other stocks will stay on my monitor list as pullbacks are needed for good risk/reward entries.
Of the six stocks, Halliburton (HAL) is closest to generating new buy signals as it has held up quite well despite the weak action in crude oil .The Best Place to Go Wild in Ireland

The Paradigm Shift & The Path Of Totality! little bit. I think this album is another great success and I think Korn are very brave to experiment with different types of music and create a new sound with it and at the end of the day, if your a true fan, you will support their decisions throughout the years and go with it.
In every Korn album you can go through the different stages of how they got to where they are with each album sounding different which I think is awesome. ''The Path Of Totality'' I think, is another one of their greatest albums and I fully respect their experiment with it.
Peace out.

Alinghi has already won two of its races in the Gold Fleet — one of two race groups — and had nothing to lose by forfeiting, while avoiding the possibility of incurring penalty points that could damage its final standing.
Alinghi and Team New Zealand last raced in the America’s Cup finals series off Valencia, Spain, in 2007 when the Swiss team beat the Kiwi challengers 5-2.
Britain’s Team Origin won the closest race of the Pacific Series so far, nipping Italy’s Luna Rossa by four seconds in a thrilling Gold Fleet contest.
After a delayed start and in light winds, Luna Rossa led round the first three marks, but Team Origin seized the lead on the final run and crossed the finish line with little more than a boat-length advantage.
San Francisco-based BMW Oracle Racing beat Damiani Italia Challenge by 26 seconds, breaking clear at the start and leading around all the marks.

Complete with "rooftop access" and a reusable tarpaulin liner, the ModKat Litter Box is a stylish place for kitties to do their biz.
Thu, May 21, 2009 at 11:14 PM
MNN family blogger Jenn Savedge recently shared her thoughts on the cat-potty-training book, Kick Litter: The Nine-Step Program for Recovering Litter Addicts. I’ve seen kitty toilet training videos in the past — ones like this doozy aren’t too hard to find on Youtube — and for me, the sight of a kitty squatting over a commode is just too bizarre (however LOL-worthy) to take seriously despite the eco-benefits of going litter-free.
My suggestion: Don’t let Fluffy hog the bathroom; keep the box and the litter, just make the latter is an earth-friendly variety…. there are plenty out there.
But what about that dreaded “poop box”? Personally, there’s one thing that’s held me back from getting a feline companion (well, also the allergies and the fact that I like dogs better) and it’s a litter box. To put it lightly, boxes are messy, ugly, and there’s nowhere convenient in the home — this is especially true for apartment dwellers — to put them.
Enter the ModKat Litter Box, a clean, aesthetically inoffensive, and low-waste alternative to basic pan and liner set-ups. It's been dubbed as a place where "modern cats do their business." The ModKat is a bit pricey — it's available for pre-order at $180 and will be shipping later in the summer — but in combination with a good eco-friendly litter, it's well worth-it. But hey, if you want to share your toilet with Tammy the tabby, then go for it ... just don’t show me the videos.
The ModKat’s design — by NY-based Fulton Street Designs — is clean and colorful (it comes in four shades: white, blue, red, and yellow) and blends well into any room … it almost resembles an ottoman or as Penelope Green notes in The New York Times: a "stylish paper shredder." The swivel, removable “rooftop entry” lid gives Mr. Peepers a bit more privacy and prevents litter from being kicked all over the place; this also eliminates the need for an external matt.
The scoop that comes with the ModKat is also pretty cool — it features an ergonomic handle and built-in brush for super easy clean up and clump scoopin’ — but the best part? The reusable, commercial-strength tarpaulin liner that comes complete with handles for easy cleaning and removal. The liner fits snuggly right into the box and makes the need for petroleum-based, non-biodegradable disposable liners obsolete.
Personally, I love the idea of a good-looking, low-mess box with a reusable liner (no, I’m still not getting a cat). Plus, the ModKat has serious design cred: it debuted at this year's ICFF and won the best accessory prize. How many folks can say that their kitty litter box won rave reviews at the granddaddy of all home design shows? Not many. But would you shell out $200.Working Paper #297
This working paper presents the methodology and data sources used to compute the Economic Policy Institute’s 2013 Family Budget Calculator.
Definition of family
The size of a family dramatically affects the budget needed to maintain a safe and comfortable, but modest, standard of living. We have constructed budgets for six different types of families in each area. These families include single-parent families with one, two, or three children, and two-parent families with one, two, or three children.
Our definition of single-parent families assumes that the head of household is employed, lives with his or her children, and is considered the head of household for federal income tax purposes. Our definition of two-parent families assumes that both partners are employed, live together with their children, and file federal income taxes jointly. An employment assumption needs to be made in order to calculate child-care costs, transportation needs, and tax liabilities.
Families with one child are assumed to have a 4-year-old. Families with two children are assumed to have a 4-year-old and an 8-year-old. Families with three children have a 4-year-old, an 8-year-old, and a 12-year-old.
Definition of areas
There are 615 areas in the 2013 EPI Family Budget Calculator. Forty-seven of these 615 areas are statewide averages of rural areas; Rhode Island, New Jersey, and Massachusetts do not have rural areas. The remaining 568 areas are defined using the following technique:
A Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) is defined by the Office of Management and Budget as having at least one urbanized area of 50,000 or more people, plus adjacent territory that has a high degree of social and economic integration with the core as measured by commuting ties (OMB 2009). Some of our data (housing section) require us to use Fair Market Rent areas (FMR areas). FMR areas are published by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (2013). They are divided into metropolitan FMR areas and nonmetropolitan FMR areas. Several of our components depend on the MSA categorization (child care and out-of-pocket medical costs in the health care section) and on population size of the MSA (transportation).
Since most metropolitan FMR areas match up with an MSA, we replaced all metropolitan FMR areas with the MSA in the list of “Family Budget” areas. The remaining nonmetropolitan FMR areas were labeled as non-MSA. The rural areas were also labeled as non-MSA.
When regional breakdowns were used for budget calculations, they are based on the Census Bureau Regions, per data availability (U.S. Census Bureau 2013).
Components of the 2013 EPI Family Budget Calculator
The 2013 EPI Family Budget Calculator consists of seven individual components: rent, food, child care, transportation, health care, other items of necessity, and taxes. The following sections will describe the methodology used to construct a monthly cost for each of these seven components across the 615 areas for which data have been made available.
Rent
Annually, HUD estimates Fair Market Rents (FMRs) in order to establish cost information for the federal government’s Section 8 housing assistance programs (HUD 2013). FMRs are used to assess the sufficiency of housing supply in MSAs for housing assistance programs. HUD obtains the data using 5-year data from the American Communities Survey (ACS). All counties that do not fall into a “family budget area” (see documentation on family budget areas) are counted as rural for that state. To establish a “rural” FMR, and thus a family budget cost for housing in a rural area, rental costs for rural counties are averaged into one price to be applied as “rural” for the entire state. Data extracts of these cost estimates are made publicly available, and EPI made use of these data to construct our family budget measure.
HUD FMR estimates are at the 40th percentile of rent cost—the dollar amount below which 40 percent of standard quality rental units are rented. HUD makes rental rates available for studio apartments and one-bedroom through four-bedroom apartments. For the EPI family budget, we assumed that families with one or two children use the two-bedroom rate. Families with three grocer and then prepared at home. We use June 2012 data that represent the annual average monthly cost (Carlson, Lino, and Fungwe 2007). The data are only available at the national level, and are thus the same for all family budget areas (except Alaska and Hawaii, which are discussed later). Since the costs of raw, unprepared foods vary relatively little over geographic areas and the data present only nationally representative costs of raw, unprepared foods, our calculations for costs of food vary only by the size of the family and not by geographical area.
Families are constructed from data for the following age categories: male 19–50, female 19–50, child 4–5, child 6–8, average of male and female for individual age 12–13.
- All costs in the USDA food plans table are for individuals in four-person families. For individuals in other size families, the following adjustments are suggested to account for differences in returns to scale for different family sizes (USDA 2013):
- Two-person – add 10 percent
- Three-person – add 5 percent
- Five-person – subtract 5 percent
- To calculate overall household food costs, we first adjust food costs for each person in the household and then sum the adjusted food costs.
- Example: For a one-parent, two-child household:
Food cost = [female(age19–50)*1.05]+[child(age 4–5)*1.05]+[child(age 6–8)*1.05]
Note that for Alaska and Hawaii, separate food cost data are available in half-year increments. We use data for the first half of the year to compute household food costs for the four Alaska areas and the two Hawaii areas because it most closely represents the annual national data used for the other states. (Note that only the “Thrifty Plan” is available for these states; there is no “Low-Cost Plan.”)
The USDA food plans represent a nutritious diet at four different cost levels. The nutritional bases of the. All four food plans are based on 2001–2002 data and updated to current dollars by using the Consumer Price Index for specific food items.
Child care
We utilize the Child Care Aware of America (2012) (formerly NACCRRA) publication Parents and the High Cost of Child Care, which relies on information provided by the January 2012 State Child Care Resource and Referral Network survey. For the purposes of this study, we use Appendix Table 1, “2011 Average Annual Cost of Full-Time Care by State,” and Appendix Table 10a, “2011 Urban-Rural Cost Difference for Center Care, by State.” Several states in the survey report data on a delay, including the District of Columbia, Iowa, Louisiana, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, and Vermont, which report 2010 data, and California and New Hampshire, which report data for 2009. If an MSA is in multiple states, the child care cost is assigned separately for each state within the MSA. Therefore, for example, child care costs would vary between St. Louis, Mo., and St. Louis, Ill.
From available years, we inflate all data to reflect real 2012 dollars using the Consumer Price Index of “Child care and nursery school” for all urban consumers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, or BLS (BLS 2013b).
We calculate our child care costs for our family types based on the following assumptions:
- One parent, one child = cost of 4-year-old care
- One parent, two children = cost of 4-year-old care + cost of one school-age child
- One parent, three children = cost of 4-year-old care + cost of two school-age children
- Two parents, one child = cost of 4-year-old care
- Two parents, two children = cost of 4-year-old care + cost of one school-age child
- Two parents, three children = cost of 4-year-old care + cost of two school-age children
Center care
- We use center care estimates instead of in-home care for our child care costs because the costs of center care do not fluctuate as much as the costs of in-home care. We assume that other family members are not available to provide care.
Infant care
- The family budget does not include infant care in its child care costs because we do not have an infant as part of any “Family Budget” family. It should be noted, however, that infant center care is significantly more expensive than 4-year-old care, so the child care component for some families may be underestimated.
Four-year-old care
- Four-year-old care is full-time care. To approximate MSA and non-MSA care, we use urban and rural estimates for all 4-year-old center care costs, taken from Appendix 10a in the Child Care Aware of America (2012) publication. Urban and rural care cost estimates are not available for Alabama, Arizona, Connecticut, Idaho, Mississippi, New Jersey, North Carolina, Rhode Island, Vermont, and West Virginia, so state averages for 4-year-old care are used instead.
School-age child care
- The survey for school-age care specifically represents the average annual cost of before- and after-school care, and therefore it does not include full-time, weekend, or full-day summer care. Because of the need for 4-year-olds (and some 12-year-olds) to be in care during the summer, the value of school-aged child care is significantly underestimated.
- Urban and rural data do not exist for school-age children, so we use state averages for all the MSAs with the exception of the District of Columbia, Idaho, Minnesota, North Carolina, North Dakota, Texas, and West Virginia, as state-level data are not reported for these states. Regional averages, based on the Census Bureau Regions and Divisions, are taken for these states. The following indicate the regions the states with missing data fall into. We construct regional averages for these states to be used instead:
- The District of Columbia falls into the South Atlantic Division, which is composed of Delaware, Florida, the District of Columbia, Georgia, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, and West Virginia.
- Minnesota falls into the West North Central Division, which is composed of Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, and South Dakota.
- North Dakota falls into the West North Central division, which is composed of Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, and South Dakota.
- North Carolina falls into the South Atlantic Division, which is composed of Delaware, Florida, the District of Columbia, Georgia, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, and West Virginia.
- West Virginia falls in the South Atlantic Division, which is composed of Delaware, Florida, the District of Columbia, Georgia, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, and West Virginia.
- Idaho falls into the Western division, which is composed of Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington.
- Texas falls into the Southwest division, which is composed of Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas.
Transportation
Data on costs of transportation are produced by the Federal Highway Administration’s 2009 National Household Travel Survey, or NHTS (FHA 2009) and IRS Announcement 2011-116 (IRS 2012). We choose to use annualized vehicle miles traveled (VMT) for calculating both the total annual miles driven and to determine the trip purpose. While it is possible to use other metrics, such as person miles traveled, we judge that in many MSAs the use of a vehicle is necessary to get to and from nearly all major destinations, such as work, medical appointments, a grocery store, etc. In areas in which public transportation is accessible and available for traveling to and from major destinations, this cost may be overstated (though obviously even public transportation carries significant costs if used every day).
Our equations for calculating total transportation costs are as follows:
Single-parent families’ transportation costs =
[(share of work & non-social trips)*(average miles per month by MSA size)*(cost/mile)]
Two-parent families’ transportation costs =
[(share of work & non-social trips)*(average miles per month by MSA size)*(cost/mile)] + [(share of work trips)*(average miles per month by MSA size)*(cost/mile)]
Equation components
- The share of work and non-social trips is calculated using the 2009 National Household Travel Survey (FHA 2009), as 2009 is the most recent year for which data are available. The variable WHYTRP1S, National Household Travel Survey. The MSASIZE uses the same definition of a Metropolitan Statistical Area as the Office of Management and Budget. The NHTS reports MSASIZE in six sizes, based on household population within a given area:
- 0–49,999 inhabitants
-. 2012 data are available at the beginning of January and are revised semi-annually for a more accurate estimate. For 2012, the revised and most accurate standard mileage rate for the use of car, van, pick-up, or panel truck is 55.5 cents per mile for business miles driven. The mileage rate includes fixed costs such as depreciation, lease payments, insurance, registration and license fees, and personal property taxes, and variable costs such as gasoline, oil, tires, and routine maintenance and repairs.
Example
Single parent in a rural area:
= (share of work & non-social trips)*(average annual miles by MSA size)/12*(cost/mile)
= (84.4/100)*$14,607/12*($0.555)
= .844*$1217.2 *$0.555
= $570.18
So $570.18 is the monthly transportation cost for a single parent who lives in a rural area.
Health care
There are two components to the health care data: total insurance premiums and total out-of-pocket costs. Data for premiums are average total premiums (in 2012 dollars) for private-sector establishments for areas within states for 2011. These data are from Table IX.A.2 from the insurance component of the Medical Expenditure Panel Study (MEPS) published by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS 2013b). Out-of-pocket costs are from the MEPS Household Component (Full-Year Consolidated File) for 2010 (HHS 2013a). To calculate data for the 40th percentile, we use Table 14 from the BLS Employee Benefits Survey (BLS 2013d).
Premiums
Benchmarking decisions
- Our benchmark insurance plan cost in the Family Budget Calculator is the cost of an employer-sponsored insurance plan. We use this benchmark for a number of reasons. First, there is wide variation in the cost of individual plans, but a good portion of this variation is due to individual characteristics (i.e., young, healthy people get cheaper insurance on the individual market). To have a benchmark influenced less by individual characteristics, we use the employer-provided plan, which is pooled across many people. Further, the cost of individual plans can vary significantly depending on the actuarial generosity of each particular plan (i.e., what share of expected medical costs will be covered by insurance versus covered out of the patient’s pocket). The actuarial generosity of employer-based plans is more tightly distributed, which also makes an employer-based plan a better single benchmark. We obviously recognize that a significant share of families do not receive health care coverage through employer-sponsored plans, but we think this is a decent benchmark and defensible minimum standard for our Family Budget Calculator.
- We use insurance from private-sector employers because data on employer-sponsored insurance from public-sector employers were only available by region and not by state. Additionally, public-sector premiums were only available for state and local government employees (there were no data on federal government employee premiums). To control for this, we would have to weight the regional state and local government premiums by public-sector employment in a state and assume that federal employees get the same premium. This would also only add a level change. Since we were already approximating the 40th percentile premiums from a proxy ratio, we did not want to create any potential inaccuracy. Premiums in the public sector tend to be more expensive, so we are more likely to understate, not overstate, the costs by using only private-sector and not public-sector premiums.
- We use total premium costs rather than focusing only on employee contributions. We do this because while we think the cost of an employer-sponsored plan is a good benchmark for what a given standard of health insurance costs, we cannot assume that people have access to any particular level of employer-provided benefit to help pay for it. No other part of the family budget construction requires assuming any particular behavior by employers, so we did not want to introduce one here. In future research we hope to look at the resources side of the equation to see what share of American families can meet the basic family budget thresholds. In constructing these shares, we will take into account the receipt of employer contributions to health insurance premiums (as well as the potential assistance received through public insurance such as Medicare and Medicaid).
Data source and selection
- We use “employee-plus-one premium” and “family premium” data. “Employee-plus-one premium” data are used for one-parent, one-child families from MEPS Table IX.A.2 (HHS 2013b). Premiums for “employee-plus-one” are generally less expensive than “family” premiums, and we assume that when one-parent, one-child families are faced with two different plans, they will opt for the less expensive alternative when it exists. “Family premium” data are used for all other family sizes.
- Some areas from MEPS Table IX.A.2 (HHS 2013b) do not match the areas chosen for the Family Budget Calculator (“Family Budget” areas). However, there usually was a very close match, so the MEPS areas were matched with the closest Family Budget area. For Family Budget areas that did not have a corresponding MEPS area, the “Remainder of state” value was used. “Remainder of state” was also used for rural Family Budget areas.
Data compilation
- Since the average total premiums from MEPS Table IX.A.2 (HHS 2013b) are annual figures, we divided by 12 to get the monthly premium.
- To calculate the premium for the 40th percentile, we used data from BLS Employee Benefits Survey Table 14, “Medical care benefits, family coverage: Employer and employee premiums by employee contribution requirement, private industry workers from the National Compensation Survey, March 2011” (BLS 2013d).
- We used a ratio of total premiums for the lowest 25th percentile to the average total premium:
total average flat monthly premium for lowest 25th percentile
—————————————————————————–
total average flat monthly premium for all workers
where the numerator is a weighted premium from the “All workers” row of data:
[(percent of participating employees in employee contribution not required) * (average flat monthly employer premium if employee contribution not required)] + [(percent of participating employees in employee contribution required) * (average flat monthly employer + average flat monthly employee contribution in employee contribution required)]
and the denominator is a weighted premium (using the same formula from above) from the “Lowest 25 percent” row of data under the heading “Average wage within the following categories.”
- We use the lowest 25th percentile because the data in this table have an income distribution based only on people with employer-sponsored insurance. The distribution is very tight and skewed upwards. We assumed that an income earner in the 40th percentile on the total income distribution would fall into the lowest 25th percentile of the income distribution of those with insurance.
- The 40th percentile premium is adjusted for inflation to 2012 dollars using the regional breakdowns of the Consumer Price Index-All Urban Consumers for Medical Care (CPI-U-MC) from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS 2013c).
Out-of-pocket costs
Benchmarking decisions
- We assume that everyone has the equivalent of an employer-sponsored health insurance plan (defined by the variable PRIEU10).
Data source and selection
- Out-of-pocket costs are from the MEPS Household Component (Full-Year Consolidated File) for 2010 (HHS 2013a).
- We use the regional breakdown of costs for both the adult and child numbers (we used the variable REGION10, with the regions defined as Northeast, Midwest, South, and West).
- The data are divided into MSA data and non-MSA data (we used the variable MSA10). For out-of-pocket costs, an area only gets MSA data if it is strictly an MSA, and nonmetropolitan Fair Market Rent areas and rural areas get non-MSA data (see “Definition of areas” documentation).
- We classify a child (regardless of family size) as age 17 and under and an adult as age 18–64 (we used the variable AGE10X). We did not break down children into smaller age groups or by gender because the resulting sample sizes were too small.
- For each Family Budget area, adult out-of-pocket costs are the mean costs (variable TOTSLF10) for adults age 18–64 with private employer-sponsored insurance in one of four regions and the metropolitan classification in that region.
- Child out-of-pocket costs are the mean costs for children age 0–17 with private employer-sponsored insurance in one of four regions and the metropolitan classification in that region in 2009.
- 2012 dollars using the regional breakdowns of the Consumer Price Index-All Urban Consumers for Medical Care (CPI-U-MC) from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS 2013c).
- When computing the mean, a population weight needs to be used (variable PERWT10F).
Other notes
- The health care costs for the 2013 Family Budget Calculator are significantly higher than the health care costs for the previous edition of the Family Budget Calculator (2007 and 2008 update), and these higher health care costs are the main reason why overall 2013 Family Budget Calculator budgets are higher than 2007 and 2008 budgets. A significant portion of the increase in health costs in the 2013 family budgets relative to the 2007 and 2008 budgets is due to a change in methodology.
- The previous editions did not solely use a benchmark based on employer-sponsored health insurance plans. They also used non-group market premiums as an input. The “sticker prices” of such non-group plans are often significantly lower than the post-underwriting premiums—and these post-underwriting premiums are not available from public data sources. We did not want to allow our health costs to become biased down by reporting less-accurate, pre-underwriting costs. The employer-sponsored health insurance premium benchmark we use instead is fully post-underwriting, reflecting the actual price.
- Additionally, previous editions made strong assumptions about resources available to households. These previous editions calculated total cost of health care as a weighted average of employer-provided plans including an average employer contribution, as well as the (substantially subsidized) costs of public plans. All of these decisions required making strong assumptions about resources available to families rather than simply costs of a benchmarked necessity.
Other necessities
Our calculation of “other necessities” is derived from the Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Expenditures Survey (BLS 2013a). We consider other items of necessity as items that do not fall into the aforementioned categories but are nevertheless necessary for a reasonably safe and comfortable, but modest, standard of living. These items include apparel, entertainment, personal care products and services, reading, education, and miscellaneous items.
Using 2011 data (the latest available data) on families in the bottom 40 percent of the overall income distribution from the 2011 Consumer Expenditures Survey expenditure table “Quintiles of income before taxes,” “other necessities” is the proportion of costs for these items in relation to the costs of food and housing (also from the Consumer Expenditures Survey). In 2011, this was 25.6 percent. We use this figure to calculate “other necessities” in our Family Budget Calculator by taking 25.6 percent of the family budget’s food and housing cost for each family budget as the cost for “other necessities.”
Taxes
The Family Budget Calculator’s.2 with ATRA to calculate these tax rates (NBER 2013; Feenberg, Richard, and Coutts 1993). The TAXSIM model accepts 22 input variables, including state, marital status, dependent exemptions, wage income, other incomes, rent paid, child care expenses, and capital gains and losses. We ran the TAXSIM model for each family type across all 615 areas.
Our input variables were (variables not listed were input as zero):
- State
- Marital status (single for one-parent families, married for two-parent)
- Dependent exemptions (one for each child)
- Wage and salary income of taxpayer (entire post-tax family budget for one-parent families)
- Wage and salary income of spouse (for two-parent families, the post-tax family budget was split evenly between the two parents)
- FICA tax liability. All of these liabilities are for year 2011 tax law. Note that in 2011 the 2.0 percent payroll tax holiday was in effect; we eliminate this payroll tax cut to move it to its 2013.
We made the conservative assumption that the full cost of health care premiums would be excluded from taxation (as there exist substantial tax advantages to employer-sponsored premiums).. Of the 3,690 family budgets, 158 budgets fall outside our initial upper and lower bounds. For these “out of bounds” observations, we progressively widen the upper and lower bounds until all observations fall within them. Of the 19 that fall below our lower bound (which is possible because refundable tax credits can result in negative effective tax rates), we decrease the bound to be 90 percent of a family budget, and this adjustment captures all “below-bound” observations. Of the 139 that fall above our upper bound, we increase the bound to 135 percent of the post- tax family budget for 126 of the budgets, 140 percent for 9 family budgets and 145% for 4 of the family budgets.
Once we had the lower and upper bounds of tax rates, we calculated an accurate average of these tax rates using the following weighting procedure:
- Multiply the lower- and upper-bound inputs to TAXSIM by (1 – tax rate calculated by TAXSIM).
- Calculate the difference between the actual post-tax family budget and the lower bound calculated in step one.
- Calculate the difference between the upper bound and the actual post-tax family budget calculated in step one.
- Calculate the difference between the upper bound and the lower bound calculated in step one.
- Calculate the weight for the lower bound, which is equal to the upper post-tax budget difference divided by the upper–lower difference.
- Calculate the weight for the upper bound, which is equal to (1 – lower-bound weight from step five).
- Multiply the lower-bound tax rate from TAXSIM by the lower-bound weight from step five.
- Multiply the upper-bound tax rate from TAXSIM by the upper-bound weight from step six.
- Add these two weights together to get the final, weighted tax rate.
The final tax rate calculated in step nine is then applied to the post-tax family incomes (multiply that income by 1 + the tax rate) to obtain a pre-tax income. The difference between the pre- and post-tax incomes is the annual tax bill for the family budget unit.

WebZoneAmerican Flags around Hawkeye.
Proudly Made in America!
How did the American flag become just what it is today?
Folding up the American flag.
The U.S. flag is a solid sign of American identification and also national pride. Additionally called Old Glory, the U.S. flag has a vibrant background and also has actually gone through numerous adjustments since the initial main flag of 1777.
Today the flag consists of thirteen straight stripes, 7 red alternating with 6 white stripes. The colors of the flag are symbolic as well: red represents strength and valiance, white represents pureness and innocence as well as blue represents vigilance, willpower and justice.
With time, some have actually associated somewhat different meanings to the three colors, for example, the shade red representing the blood spilled to maintain our freedoms, but the essence of the initial meaning has actually been rather consistent since 1782.
Just how did the American flag grow into what it is today?
It is a lot greater than the 3 colors or a “design”. Consider the locations around the globe that the American flag has flown, think of the transformation it has gone through throughout the years on American territory. It is really humbling to consider all that was provided and compromised to ensure that the American flag can fly openly throughout this country.
The flag that began with only 13 stars expanded to 50 with the addition of new states to the Union. The number of stars on the flag progressively increased to its present certainly not take place as it will make the flag appear crowded and it would make the flag unwieldy. It was decided then that the flag would go back to including just thirteen stripes to represent the initial colonies.
The American flag is a symbol not only of hardiness, valor, pureness, innocence, vigilance, perseverance and justice; it is a symbol of liberty. Liberty that has actually been fought so hard for over the decades. Freedom that has cost this nation as well as the households within a lot, but it is still a beacon to those wishing they had the liberty that the country has.
Folding the American flag.
Conventional flag rules prescribes that prior to an American flag is kept or presented, its handlers ought to twice fold it in half lengthwise; then (from the other end opposite heaven area) make a triangular fold, remaining to fold it in triangles until the other end is reached. This makes a triangular “pillow” of the flag with only heaven starred area showing outside, and it takes thirteen folds to produce: two lengthwise folds and eleven triangular ones.
The flag isn’t folded up in this way because each of the folds has a unique symbolic definition; the flag is folded this way since it gives a dignified ceremonial touch that distinguishes folding a flag from folding an ordinary thing such as a blanket, and also due to the fact that it results a visually pleasing, easy-to-handle shape. This thirteen-fold procedure was a common practice long before the creation of a ritualistic assignation of “implying” to each of the steps.
A sophisticated flag folding ceremony incorporating these definitions has actually from then on been designed for unique occasions such as Memorial Day as well as Veterans Day. These connections are “real” in the feeling that they mean something to the people that join the ceremony, yet they are not the reason that a flag is folded up in the standard thirteen-step manner.
This is America and also its symbol is the American Flag. This respectable icon has been shot at, set fire to, spit on and also stepped on, and yet she rises time and again. Despite the fact that numerous Americans in the state of Iowa happily fly the flag outside their homes and businesses every day, it is fitting that we, as a nation, have actually reserved one particular day yearly to recognize our flag and also to keep in mind that it represents the beliefs and values that we ought to make every effort to maintain. May God bless America as well as those that protect her.

Question: Would you be satisfied with a "Parts Only" warranty if you were to buy a budget-priced car such as a Hyundai, for $14,000? Answer: Of course not! ....so why would you even consider purchasing a tractor from a dealer that offered a Parts-only warranty?
Question: Would you be satisfied with a warranty system for your tractor where you could only make a claim using an online form?
Answer: No! Why would you trust a company that deliberately made its after-sales obligations difficult to access.
SOTA recommends that prospective purchasers read any written warranty before purchase; understand how the warranty may be claimed and request that the vendor show them a spare parts inventory, in stock and on the shelf. Being shown a canabalised, parts tractor should ring alarm bells!
Beware of warranties that seem too good to be true such as a 5-year warranty, which has ostensibly been offloaded to a 3rd party insurer. This offering may be appropriate when buying a TV set but for a tractor purchase of possibly $20,000 or more, your gut feeling should tell you that these warranties will be difficult to claim as the warranty underwriters are not in the business of fixing tractors but selling insurance. If these warranties were considered of real value to customers, all tractor vendors would offer them because they're cheap to purchase and on-sell.
Beware of warranties that "conveniently" become void - for example: if you do not use the vendor's preferred "brand" of oil or if you have misplaced your receipt for an air-filter element. Yes! It does happen and unfortunately you have no come-back because it is in the fine-print of the warranty.
When you intend to purchase a tractor, you should consider these issues as an essential part of the product that you are purchasing. You need to understand what you are being offered and you need to be confident that the vendor will actually deliver on its promises.

“In the conduct of so large anengineering undertaking, thousands of photographsfor information and record will be required.”
—Annual Report of the Board of Water Supply, 1906
During the 19th century, photography was utilized for many purposes: personal portraits, landscape scenes, to document military events like the Civil War, and as a force for change by social reform photographers. However it was also used for the building of infrastructure.
Realizing the value of the photographic record, the Board needed to be sure that the work was done “systematically and the plates and films properly preserved.” As part of this investment, $2,278.16 was books and maps during the first year and a half of the Board’s existence. These funds were used to establish a photographic laboratory for making prints and filing negatives (which at the time were 8x10 inches and made of glass). In addition, equipment was purchased in order to photograph working drawings and create small, blue-print versions for engineers to carry in the field. They also needed someone to operate this equipment and on July 19, 1906 the Board appointed Harry Coutant as full-time photographer, at a salary of $1,200 per year. As official photographer, Mr. Coutant was responsible for routinely documenting construction, but field departments were also given cameras and developing equipment in order to provide additional coverage over the vast construction area.
The identity of the individual who replaced Mr. Coutant when he resigned in November 1908 is unknown, but on April 29, 1909 he was joined by William Bresnan, who would become a mainstay of the Photography Unit for forty years. Born in 1877, Mr. Bresnan started working with photography at the young age of 15. He was employed by a large commercial photography company for several years and then opened his own business, his primary client being the Fuller Construction Company in New York City. By 1915 he was the sole photographer at the Board of Water Supply and his “treks along the line of the tunnel, taking the thousands of photographs that make up the pictorial history of the Board’s activities, gave him a knowledge...of the work possessed by few others in B.W.S. employ.” According to his obituary, many of Mr. Bresnan’s photographs were regarded as “photographic masterpieces.” An image of the Ashokan Reservoir Headworks taken in 1917 was particularly popular and reproduced in all manner of publications. Construction is a dangerous undertaking, even for photographers, and Bresnan had a number of accidents on the job. The most serious was when he nearly lost his eyesight while taking a photo from a raft in a section of the Catskill Aqueduct known as the Garrison tunnel—the flashlight powder flared up in his face and he was badly burned.
While there were two employees with the title of Photographer at the time of Mr. Bresnan’s death in June 1949, by 1951 there were no employees with that civil service title. However the Photography Unit continued to exist and played an important role by developing and reproducing prints, making lantern slides, reductions and enlargements for presentations, and photographing construction operations of the Delaware system. In fact, the Board’s Photographic Unit was designated the official engineering photographers for the Public Works’ Emergency Division of the Office of Civil Defense.
Throughout the 1950s and 1960s the Photo Unit continued to document the construction of the Delaware water system and in-city work such as the Richmond Project. In 1968, current DEP Photographer Carl Ambrose took the two-day civil service test for Photographer, which included a practical section that required photographing various subjects (architectural, portraiture, etc.) and then developing the film. Carl passed the test and joined the Board’s Photo Unit in 1969, then under the direction of Everard Marius. Along with Frank Tartaglia, the third member of the unit. They each went out to a different job site accompanied by engineers who provided information about each photograph, including the location, description of the work activity being shown and technical information. This information was carefully logged and formed the basis of detailed captions which would become an important part of the construction record.
Back at the lab, the photographers developed their own film and made contact sheets in order to select the best shots to develop prints. At the time Carl was hired the Photo Unit was using press cameras which used 4x5 inch negatives, but during the early 1970s he suggested the Photo Unit make the switch to 35mm film, which was easier to carry on construction sites and did not affect the overall quality of the prints being developed. Unfortunately, during the city fiscal crisis of 1975-76 the Photo Unit was reduced once again to two photographers. Despite the decrease in staff, Carl and Everard Marius continued to photograph the monumental construction of City Water Tunnel No. 3. In 1978, the Board of Water Supply was merged into the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), which had been formed in 1977, and the Board of Water Supply photographers were joined by their DEP Bureau of Water Supply counterparts.
The time and effort put into the creation, documentation and maintenance of the Board of Water Supply’s photographic legacy has been well-rewarded. The DEP Archive holds more than 25,000 photographs that were taken by the Board (and later DEP) during its existence, ranging from large-format glass plate negatives to photographic prints to 35mm color transparencies. These photographs continue to be valuable to DEP - not only as significant historical artifacts - but also critical sources of information for fulfilling its mission.

Poulter's putter search concludes
Ian Poulter tweeted a photo of the putter he selected after a thorough search. (Ian Poulter)
By Jonathan Wall, PGATOUR.COM Equipment Insider
Ian Poulter's search for a new putter for The Open Championship came to an end on Tuesday evening after the two-time PGA TOUR winner tweeted out a photo of his new flatstick with the caption: "My putter is selected for the week. It is an Odyssey White Damascus. Rolling it very nice. Testing over for now."
Poulter took to social media last week to begin his search and asked equipment manufacturers to send prospective putters to his "IJP office."
"I am sacking my putter, I will use a new putter at the Open," Poulter tweeted last Tuesday. ."
Plenty of putter companies tried to get Poulter's attention ahead of the third major of the year, including Yes! Golf who sent the Englishman four models with the Union Jack flag in the putter face. But in the end, Poulter decided to stick with an Odyssey putter.
According to Odyssey Golf, the White Damascus putter Poulter plans to use was recently introduced to media and retailers in Japan. The putter insert is made with Damascus steel, the same steel that's been used to make samurai swords for hundreds of years.
Tungsten was also added to the flange to get the center of gravity deep and low to increase "gear effect," which subsequently increases roll.
Poulter had been using an Odyssey XG No. 7 but shelved the putter following a T-25 finish at the French Open two weeks ago. He only has two top-10 starts this season on the PGA TOUR and currently ranks 45th in strokes gained-putting and 80th in total putting.Awesome: 24
This page was put to crowner
, so here's the re-constructed page for you, now organized by season.
Day 1
- Jack's "towel" speech, or the final shootout at the pier with the Drazen brothers.
- The final shootout deserves more elaboration. To lure Jack in, the bad guys have their mole tell him that Kim has been killed. "He'll be here," one says. He immediately busts in, Guns Akimbo, and just starts emptying magazines. This place is filled with the dudes behind the real conspiracy that was behind what we thought was the conspiracy, and they'd been downright scary Out Gambitting Badasses who'd driven the tensest, most suspenseful action series you'd ever seen, holding all the cards ever since they were revealed. Then Papa Bear lost his Kimmy, or so he thinks. The result is him going through like a machine, making every terrorist and Mook eat lead. Five minutes of Terminator action later, a completely one-sided fight in which Jack mechanically, wordlessly kills whatever moves no matter what they try against him ends with him as the only living human being on the compound. All year, these guys were so unstoppable, so scary, so in control of the entire chessboard. Then one day they screwed with Papa Wolf. Then they died.
- Teri gets one when she shoots the man who's trying to strangle Kim... remember, this is before we know Kim's going to make a habit of getting into these situations at complete random while having no relevance to the overall story... and then she shoots him again, calmly telling Kim that the man's boss was expecting to hear two shots.
- What sold it to me was allowing herself to be raped to save Kim. For this to be the same terrorist in the first example makes this even sweeter, and Hope Levy's comments about this are just the icing on the cake.
- One must be impressed by the way Presidential Candidate David Palmer faced down the hoodlums in the parking garage, not only by catching a swung baseball bat (not something one expects of a politician) but by speaking directly into their poverty after they recognize him. The pen is mightier, indeed.
- The moment right before when Kevin/Alan Not!York gets into the limo before realizing that Jack's behind the wheel. "Hello, Alan."
- Jack unblinkingly watches Kevin unload his entire pistol into the bulletproof window between the two of them.
- David Palmer walking into CTU LIKE A BOSS note , without any kind of foreshadowing beforehand.
- Although he's mentioned very little, President David Palmer's son, Keith Palmer gets a huge CMoA when he turns the tables on the people blackmailing his father and winds up effortlessly getting the fools to record a confession on tape. The professional espionage agents on the shows have strained to do better.
- Dan's brother Frank getting arrested.Krugman: Hey, Frankie.Frank: What, homey?Krugman: You have the right to remain silent... (cops crash the house)
- Tony showing up to save Teri.
Day 2
- "I'm gonna need a hacksaw."
- In season 2, Jack killing a renegade soldier with a flare gun.
- David Palmer's response to Mike Novick telling him that you don't call the President by his first name.
- Final episode of season 2, where Jack uses a sniper rifle to take down multiple Mooks AND kill a man with a 360 degree neckbreaker.
- Note that he was in the middle of HAVING A HEART ATTACK while doing this, due to having briefly died during torture a few hours earlier.
- Jack is forcing Nina to talk to the terrorists she is working with about the nuke they are going to detonate. Keep in mind that Jack is still hurting over Nina murdering his wife, and he had drugged guards, shot at her head and nearly beat her to death, so he is not messing around. Nina is decomposed and terrified of Jack but still says she's a dead woman by going in, which leads to this exchange.Nina: "He is going to put a bullet in my head before I can say hello and then turn the gun on himself."
- The scene where Jack had captured Syed Ali, and in order to make him reveal were the nuke was hidden, made him watch a live video of his family rounded up by special forces in his home country. When Ali refuses to break, Jack has the special forces troopers shoot Ali's son, all the while shouting '"WHERE IS THE BOMB?!" Doubly so because Jack had staged it rather than truly had his son executed; even Jack Bauer has limits.
- George Mason's Heroic Sacrifice was his personal Crowning Moment of Awesome.
- Marie's reveal was not only a CMOA, but makes her this troper's favorite villain in the series.
- Jack baiting Nina in Episode 10 while she has a machine gun trained on him. He essentially gets her to follow him out into the open so that a CTU sniper can land a clean shot on her, incapacitating her and saving Jack's life.
- Miguel beating up Gary in a fight as the latter attempted to stop him, Kim and Megan from leaving the hospital.
Day 3
- Jack finally killing Nina Myers, and doing so in the very same room she killed Teri four years ago.Jack: "You don't have any more useful information, do you?"Nina: "I...I doooo..."Jack (upon seeing Nina reach for a gun nearby): "No you don't."'*BANG* *BANG* *BANG*
- Jack shooting a man through a wall in the MI6 L.A. bureau building.
- Jack cutting off his partner's hand to safely transport a lethal virus to a contained area.
- Jack's breakdown at the end of the season finale.
- After being totally kidnapped by the baddies, Michelle fakes a nose bleed so that she can try to escape and call CTU, by tricking her guard into thinking she has the Cordilla Virus. The plan itself was a fail, but the mere idea of it is awesome.
- Chase Edmunds cauterizing his own gunshot wound with a red-hot poker.
- Despite being a bit part, Bruce Foxton became a legend among fans for his brief appearance in Season 3. Assisting Wayne with the break-in to Sherry Palmer's house, they were caught red-handed in their plan. Upon being questioned, Foxton promptly intervened by punching her out cold.
- Michael Amador luring a Delta team to an ambush. I know he's a bad guy, but that was beautiful.
- The Mid-Season Twist in Episode 7 orchestrated by Jack, Tony and Gael. The look on Chappele's face says it all.
- Sherry Palmer gives Alan Milliken a heart attack by talking to him because she is such a bitch!
- Sherry herself getting shot dead (finally!) after again underestimating Julia Milliken and leaving her to fend for herself with the police.
- Chloe gets her first real awesome moment midway through the season when she realizes the trick behind Nina's data worm and successfully expunges it before it could breach the cover of every single agent in the system.
Day 4
- Jack's one-man assault on a terrorist base to free the Secretary of Defense and his daughter.
- Dina Araz's speech telling Jack she's only helping him because CTU has her son, and if it weren't for that, she'd do everything she could against him.
- Chloe gunning down terrorist assassins with an M-16.
- Curtis' coldcock punch to the assassin Mandy in the season finale.
- Tony's entrance in season 4, shooting terrorists and saving Jack and Audrey.
- Secretary Heller's utter lack of respect or fear regarding his terrorist kidnappers. It's actually kind of hilarious how indignant he is toward him. Also, similar to Michelle in Season 3, he fakes a heart attack in an attempt to trick his guards into checking up on him, giving him and Audrey a chance to escape the compound. Like Michelle's gambit, it doesn't quite pay off, but it goes a long way to proving his determination.
- Later, when Jack breaks in to rescue them, James Heller takes up a gun and helps Jack fight off his captors.
Day 5:
- Curtis Manning's run with the nerve gas bomb.
- Chloe relieving Miles Papazian of his ID badge. Before now we'd only seen Jack perform that sort of sleight-of-hand.
- Jack: "Let's get something straight, kid. The only reason you're still conscious is because I don't want to carry you."
- Secret Service Agent Aaron Pierce, after being kidnapped by crooked President Logan and asked to forget about the incriminating recording: "There is nothing that you have said or done that is acceptable to me in the least. You are a traitor to this country and a disgrace to your office. And it is my duty to see that you're brought to justice for what you've done. Is there anything else, Charles?"
- Moment Of Awesome for Glenn Morshower as well: he nailed the scene in a single take.
- Jack captures Henderson, only for him to ramp the smugness up to ten and get Secretary Heller on the phone. Heller, who's driving on a mountain road, sees that a sniper is aiming at him from a helicopter. Henderson starts to smug some more that Heller will be killed unless Jack lets him go. Heller takes things into his own hands, declaring that he won't be used like this before driving his car off the mountain, leaving Jack free to go to town on Henderson. The best part? Heller is such a monumental example of Authority Equals Asskicking that he survives.
- The way Curtis Manning relieves Lynn McGill of duty. Not only was it legal by way of CTU protocol, but Curtis even threatened to pull a gun out in front of ARMED guards. And the best part? The guards surrounding them totally agreed with Curtis and took the guy into custody. Epic way to get rid of the annoying, incompetent leader.
- Jack interrogates the Chief of Staff, Walt Cummings, in front of a protesting President Charles Logan. Aaron Pierce added more Awesome. Also when they first come into the room is a Big Damn Heroes Moment.?"
- Pierce saving the Suvarovs and Martha Logan from terrorists. Certified badass.
- Martha Logan needed someone's key card to get into the archives room, so she started ripping her clothes and threatened to accuse him of attempted rape. The calm voice she uses makes one wonder if she's done this before.On the count of 3, I'm gonna scream louder than any woman you've ever heard. One, two...
- In the season finale, there's Logan discovering that he incriminated himself by threatening Martha while wearing a transmitter Jack had planted on him. The best part is, he suspects Martha is wired, it just doesn't occur to him that Jack wired him that that was, in fact, the whole point of Jack's earlier publicly broadcast interrogation of Logan:Logan: Agent Clarke, arrest these men, and get them the hell out of here.Clarke: I'm sorry Mr. President, we have our orders.Logan: You take...! You take your orders from me.Clarke: Not anymore. After you, sir.[Logan is taken away then spots, Martha and Mike Novic, who each have the smuggest smiles possible]
- Before it became clear how much of an Obstructive Bureaucrat he would become, Lynn Mc Gill actually accomplishes one during the airport hostage crisis. Jack has been held under duress by the terrorists and is forced to lead on Curtis' team that it's okay to start their assault, even though doing so would lead to an ambush. However, Jack specifically tells Curtis that he is in a "flank two" position. Lynn, curious, decides to run through the transcript of their call, something that annoys Bill and Chloe, who see it as redundant and a waste of resources. However, with less than 60 seconds before Curtis' ill-fated assault could begin, Mc Gill runs in and informs Bill that "flank two" was an outdated duress code from back when Jack used to work at CTU, something that no one was able to realize up to that point because they ran the code through CTU's current protocol filter. Thanks to this, Curtis is able to abort the assault and redeploy the men so that they utterly trounce the terrorist faction, suffering no casualties on their part.
Day 6:
- Jack escapes from captivity by a cell of terrorists by biting out a guard's throat.
- His final battle with Fayed and about 6 terrorists with machine guns (while Jack himself had only a pistol), scored with perhaps the most operatic music the show has ever used. Jack ends up shooting to death all mooks and wrapping Fayed up in industrial strength chains, and tells him "Say hello to your brother" (who Jack had killed years before) before going to the controls and raising the chains into the ceiling, hanging him. When other agents finally arrive on the scene, all their leader can say is "Damn, Jack."
- Jack reducing Logan to tears... by staring at him.
- Wayne Palmer's Batman Gambit that gets Fayed's country to reveal information regarding him so they can get one step closer to stopping the nuke threat.
- During the first six hours, Wayne has really been screwing up pretty badly and making some pretty poor judgement calls. The kicker is when it seems like he's actually going to agree with an extreme policy that will get thousands of Muslim-Americans stripped of their rights and herded into detention camps until after Fayed is caught. But after some careful consideration, he soon calls a meeting and flat-out states that he rejects the policy, since doing so would go against everything the country stands for. Finally, he begins living up to the family name.
- After some rogue government employees nearly get Wayne killed, Tom Lennox, who knew about the conspiracy and was being held hostage as a result, has apparently just been bought off by them in exchange for keeping his silence. Mere seconds after that, Lennox then just casually walks over to a secret service agent and confesses everything to him, immediately getting the two crooked workers arrested. And that's how Tom Lennox went from being one of biggest pains on the show to one of the coolest characters.
Redemption:
- In the two short hours that made up 24: Redemption, we had time to both be introduced to Benton and witness his Crowning Moment of Awesome. He saves a wandering child from stepping on a landmine, but ends up stepping on it himself. If he lifts his foot off of it, it will explode. Benton tells Jack and the kids to leave him behind because it would take Jack too long to defuse the landmine. When the pursuing enemy soldiers come near Benton's position, he flags them down to get their attention, takes a few shots from their guns, draws them closer by pretending that he's trying to tell them Jack's location but is too hurt to speak loudly, and then says "Go to Hell" and lets the mine blow up.
Day 7:
- After looking like a milquetoast wimp for the first quarter of season seven, Henry Taylor manages to throttle his turncoat bodyguard to death while almost completely paralyzed. The looks on both their faces were priceless.
- The chemical plant manager shown in the 2:00-3:00 episode, gets his when he unhesitatingly vents insecticide into the same room he is in to save the rest of the people in his plant, as well as the nearby city of 30,000.
- Jack's escape from FBI's Washington Branch...by driving off the second floor of a parking garage...while under the steering wheel."This is so going to hurt. AAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRGGGGGGGG!!!!!!"
- The Dragon's unwitting girlfriend Marika gets one in the car on the way to the airfield to take her and Dubaku out of the country. Having found out about what "Samuel" has been up to (butchering Sangalans, crashing planes, corrupting a good-sized portion of the United States Government, putting Henry Taylor in the hospital, etc), she grabs the wheel from the driver, completely flipping the car over a parked vehicle in the middle of a high-speed car chase and dies in the process, allowing Bauer and Walker to capture a critically injured Dubaku and essentially conclude the first arc of the season.
- Renee gives her all to save Marika from the burning car, pulling her gun on Jack when he tries to get her away and telling him to help her or leave. Later, Jack says if she points a gun at him again, she should be prepared to use it. Walker replies, "I was."
- Agent Walker should also get one for, in the same scene, questioning Jack's humanity, as well as for bitch slapping him twice.
- The assault on the White House is a moment for everyone. For Dubaku for getting in and having the firepower, for Jack and Bill for getting the president to the panic room, and to Aaron for hiding out with the President's daughter. He may have got caught, but he took his attacker out.
- Bill Buchanan, saving the lives of everyone else in the White House while being held hostage by taking a gun from one of the guards, running into a room filled with natural gas, and firing the gun. This allowed Jack and the rest of the FBI/Secret Service to get into the White House, which ended with Juma being killed and the President being rescued.
- The Big Bad of Season 7, Jonas Hodges has had some awesome moments so far. But in the latest episode, he killed someone who has been his friend for 20 years by hitting him with a bottle of scotch, then throwing him off of a balcony. After that, he just nonchalantly washed the blood off of his shirt and walked away. He outdid almost everything he has done this season.
- While the President's daughter, Olivia, has proven herself to be an unrepentant bitch, you almost felt bad for her when she gets suckered into sleeping with a reporter, who then goes back on his word to run a story. I say "almost felt bad" not because she got what she deserved, but because it turns out she turns the tables on him by revealing she taped their sex and threatening to show everyone, including his wife, unless he packed up and left Washington immediately. You hate the bitch but you ADORE her gangsta. That, my friends, is what TV Tropes calls a Magnificent Bitch!
- Tony's accomplice in the bioweapon theft has turned on him and has a gun trained dead center on his chest. Tony tells him he really doesn't want to do this. A moment later, Tony knocks the gun out of the man's hand with a duffel bag, wrestles him into a nearby bathroom, tears down the shower curtain, and strangles him to death with it while interrogating him.
- Everyone give it up for Mutadhi Gohar, Jibraan's imam! He starts out unconditionally defending the man against Jack's accusations, no matter how scary and unhinged Jack gets, then when Jack finds out Jibraan was framed, he doesn't give what would have been a quite justified "I told you so," but takes the high road and tells him God is always available to him.
- Also, give it up for Jibraan's kid brother Hamid. After being chloroformed, having guns pulled on him, and suffering the trauma of his brother telling him he's a terrorist, the kid still has enough balls and reflex that with a split-second distraction, he busts a mirror, grabs a piece, and stabs the punk terrorist guarding right in the throat. If CTU is ever back up and running, they should seriously hire him.
- And, of course, Jibraan himself. A scared, innocent Muslim being set up as the patsy for the terrorists, he's told to retrieve a package and plant it somewhere that it will detonate, spreading a viral weapon everywhere. He searches for it, finds it, and then seeks frantically for a way to smuggle it to safety, knowing that, as a Middle-Eastern man acting suspiciously, the guards must be on to him. His response? "I am a terrorist! I have a bomb!" The crowds flee, the guards back off, the audience both laughs and cheers, and he saves the day.
- From the same episode: Once again, Janice starts complaining when the FBI starts looking for all Muslims in Washington, as she feels it's racial profiling. Jack Bauer, who already served her once, gets back in her face. But this time... Jack calmly tells her that he's just as pained as she that they have to racially profile all Muslims, but he's trying to save lives and he'll gladly do it another way if there is one. Janice backs down without another peep. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, Jack is so Bad Ass, he doesn't have to kick your ass to kick your ass.
- Everyone groans as Kim is put in danger to blackmail Jack yet again. However, this time, she stabs one of her captors (with a pen) just in time to get away from the shots the other one fires, then follows the man and lets the cavalry know his location. After his car flips over, she goes into the burning vehicle to get a key piece of evidence and manages to fight off his last desperate attack, severely burning her arm but getting away with the bad guys' location. She's officially The Kimberly no more.
- Points should also go to the security personnel at the airport. When Kim alerts the airport's security personnel to the male captor's location, the captor retaliates by shooting at Kim and the guards from his car. While one of the guards falls instantly the other fires back and, despite getting shot, keeps firing at the male captor one-handed and nails him repeatedly as the shots pierce the windshield. And the guard survives, too!
- President Allison Taylor demonstrates that even though she cares about her family, she is the President of The United States, and her duty comes first. In old-school Biblical fashion, she will no longer be called Allison Taylor. Henceforth, she will be known as President Allison Palmer.
- Although it in itself is a bittersweet moment, Renee's final scene in the Season 7 finale is her Crowning Moment of Awesome. Having captured the mastermind behind the tragedies in the day, Renee, having undergone twenty-four hours of Break the Cutie, spaces out angrily and alone as she looks at the captured Alan Wilson. Janis comes in to inform Renee that Alan's to be transferred out, but Renee, having come to a decision, tells Janis to get out. When Janis, knowing Renee probably wants revenge, refuses, Renee destroys the lock mechanism on the door and forces Janis to handcuff herself to a pole so no one can interfere, then walks calmly and silently into the interrogation room where Alan awaits. It isn't shown on screen, but it's heavily implied Renee decides that she's going to torture Alan to force him to give up information on the conspiracy. Although it's supposed to be a tragic moment — Renee's heart-wrenching and inevitable descent from Lawful Good to Chaotic Good - -the fact that she's going along the exact same route as Jack's I Did What I Had to Do mentality gives fans a lot to look forward to.
- Jack Bauer is finally at rest, but asks to see one last person. But it's not Kim. It's the Imam from earlier. More like Crowning Moment of Heartwarming, but it can work here as well.
Day 8:
- Jack quickly runs out of bullets while running from two hitmen with automatic weapons. His response: take them both out with a fire ax.
- Held at gunpoint by a Russian hitman, Cole refuses to comply with his demands to get him out safely and gives their position away. And this wasn't part of any plan; he was fully prepared to die to help the other CTU agents catch the hitman, and would have if Jack hadn't shown up.
- Renee Walker displays she's taken a turn towards Crazy Awesome since the previous season by slicing a suspect's thumb off to remove his parole bracelet.
- Cole takes "Taking the Bullet" to the next level by blocking a bomb blast with his car.
- Seconds after getting a completely unexpected knife in his gut, he pulls it out and throws it with perfect accuracy into a Mook's trachea. Then he guns down the remaining bad guys through the wall, like he's already forgotten that he's seriously injured. And as if that's not enough, he then comforts the Broken Bird who stabbed him.
- CTU Director Brian Hastings proves that he has transcended his Stupid Boss origins by facing down President Taylor's Chief of Staff. "Get the hell out of my way."
- Farhad Hassan's efforts to screw over his colleagues who betrayed him are impressive. Granted, he calls CTU out of self-preservation as much as a desire for revenge, but then when he is shot, he agrees with one of his last remaining breaths to help CTU. He doesn't request morphine, nor does he demand immunity on the off chance that he pulls through.
- After the mother of a would-be suicide bomber fails to talk him out of it, Jack goes from good cop to bad cop in record time, promising the bomber that if he doesn't turn himself in, Jack will personally see to it that his mother is at the blast site when the Big Bad's nuclear bomb goes off. But first, he will make the bomber's mother clean up his exploded remains.
- Tarin killing the NYPD team, pretending to be one of them and giving a false report to Jack (who didn't believe him).
- Chloe rebooting a fried CTU at gunpoint after no one lets her do it the easy way.
- Renee rescuing Jack and Cole after the two have been pinned down by terrorists, by walking around and one-shotting everyone in her way.
- The evacuation of President Hassan. Even though they took casualties, for once, the Secret Service detail actually dished out the same punishment they received on their attackers.
- After getting dangerously close to Jumping Off the Slippery Slope, Hassan comes back from the brink and saves Jack's life with the handgun he insisted on being given, making a very long one-handed shot right into the attacker's head.
- Hassan really went out as a hero. Turning himself in to the terrorists and saving New York with seven seconds to spare, followed by refusing to say he was wrong to seek peace with America throughout ever more horrific torture until finally the terrorists are forced to just kill him.
- Charles Logan's brunch meeting with the Russian delegates, where he quickly drops all pretense and just blackmails them into going along with the peace treaty. "I'm not insinuating. I'm saying. Elements inside your government were behind the death of President Hassan. First on the list: you."
- Jack killing the leader of Logan's torture squad who's holding Dana hostage, as the man is right in the middle of saying he knows Jack won't risk taking the shot.
- Later in that same episode, Cole Ortiz becomes probably the only person besides James Heller to ever knock Jack Bauer on his ass and live.
- On the way up to Novakovich's hotel room, Jack suffers his second knife wound to the gut of the day. A few minutes later, Logan calls, and the phone is answered by the one surviving guard, who crawls past the bodies of all his comrades, plus Novakovich, who Jack took out with a fireplace poker.
- Earlier that same episode, Jack Bauer marches down a tunnel full of cars in New York City, armed with an assault rifle and a full body suit (with a blast shield face mask and kevlar). Bauer unleashes suppressing fire on the cars, forcing every vehicle to stop, including the motorcade Charles Logan is inside. Logan, after hearing what happened to the guy Bauer tortured in the previous episode, gets completely scared and screams for his men to save him. Of course, this doesn't work; after nonchalantly shrugging off several gunshots and dispatching all opposition, Jack gets on the hood of Logan's limo, fires a few shots at the bulletproof windshield to crack it, kicks a hole in it, and puts a tear gas grenade in the hole, forcing Logan out of the car. Jack drags Logan into a different area and interrogates him, frightening a crucial confession out of Logan in seconds, making their previous stare down in the season five finale look tame in comparison. What makes all this even better is that it PALES in comparison to the off-screen massacre Jack does to the Russians twenty minutes later. AND throughout the whole thing, Jack only shot to wound, whereas Logan's men were shooting to kill. AND, Jack placed a listening device on Logan's collar to acquire even more information from him later in the episode. This entire sequence is EPIC in its badassery.
- Damn, Darth Bauer. DAYUM.
- Note that Logan's freak-out in the tunnel basically sums up the entire series:"Did you hear what I said? THAT'S JACK BAUER!!"
- In the series finale, Chloe goes alone to try to talk down a dangerously unhinged Jack. Despite initially getting surprised and cuffed to a pipe, she's able to give him a What the Hell, Hero? speech that breaks through his Roaring Rampage of Revenge and gets him to realize that getting his revenge this way will do far more harm than good. And finally, having convinced Jack to do things her way, she shoots him to ward off questions of how she handled the situation long enough to leak the info that will bring down the day's big conspiracy.
- After pulling out of the peace agreement and essentially giving the Russians the finger, Allison Taylor calls up Logan's hired thugs and orders them to release Jack and wait for the FBI. If they don't, a drone overhead has two AGM-114 Hellfire missiles pointed right at them.
- After Taylor goes to Dalia Hassan and confesses the entire scheme, Hassan demands (rightly) to pull out of the peace accords. Taylor bitch-slaps her down with a thunderous speech about how America has the power, and Taylor has no qualms about using it. Moving even further over the Moral Event Horizon? Yeah, probably. Doing it in exceptionally awesome manner? Yes.
- The 2-4 PM ending. Everyone thought Jack would try to kill Suvarov at the press conference. Instead, he uses Logan to lure Suvarov into his office so he can kill them both. His Slasher Smile at the end was icing to the cake.
- In the finale, when Jack is wounded and being taken in, Pillar begins to figure out the truth that he let Chloe intentionally shoot him and is currently working to reveal the truth behind Logan and Taylor's actions. Realizing what he's up to, Jack lures Pillar over... and proceeds to bite a good chunk of one of his ears off! Moral of the story: Even when wounded, Jack is still someone you really have to be wary of.
Day 9/Live Another Day
- "11AM-12PM"
- The cold opener of the show. A heavily armed CIA strike team surround where they believe Jack Bauer is and seemingly have him dead to rights when they storm into the warehouse he's been tracked down to. He leads them on a merry chase across a portion of South London, slowly picking off members of the team who outgun him through a judicious use of hand to hand combat. He is only captured when he gets cornered on the banks of the Thames with reinforcements on a Zodiac moving in along with the final agent on the team coming in from behind.
Jack: You probably think I'm at a disadvantage. I promise you I'm not.
- Jack allows himself to be caught by agents of a CIA black site. His internal reasoning? To save Chloe, who had been captured days before.
- The escape from the CIA black site also shows that Jack hasn't missed a beat since we last saw him. While being led down to the torture chamber by the Jerk Ass Agent Rittler, Jack first activates a pre-planted beacon in his wrist. He then chokes the arrogant, younger operative with his handcuffs, breaks loose, and before another agent can get to him, Jack is already sticking a Glock 17 in the man's face while delivering his first Bad Ass Boast of the season. He then finds Chloe, revives her, and with Agent Kate Morgan bearing down on them, uses his gun to set off a colossal explosion which guts a significant portion of the building. Meanwhile, Jack's associate, who's been notified by the beacon, destroys a portion of the sidewalk with a grenade launcher, deploys a ladder down the newly created opening, and before any of the CIA personnel have realized how badly Jack has outwitted them, their prisoners are long gone.
- Mark Bodreau looking up Jack's file and finding a list of every kill he made over eight seasons. A very impressive sight and one hell of a Freeze-Frame Bonus.
- Jack singlehandedly dispatches a heroin dealer and his hired thugs without even breaking a sweat. And the prior conversation where you can tell that Jack just knows that those scumbags don't stand a chance against him.
- Jack Bauer is in need for information which can only be found in the American Embassy. When Chloe's new employer, Adrian Cross, screws him over, and with Kate Morgan once again breathing down his neck, he neutralizes an Armed Metropolitan police officer, takes said officer's gun, and, using his jacket to cover the weapon, begins delivering knee caps to a group of protesters outside the embassy gates while inciting a riot, forcing the Embassy to deploy their security, which opens the gate and allows Jack to waltz in.
- A kind of meta-example: When Morgan finally gets the evidence for Al-Harazi's imminent terrorist drone attack, everyone takes it right away. Her IT buddy confirms the code, her CIA boss sends it to the president, the chief of staff puts the call on speaker, the president orders all drones to be grounded, and the general in charge executes the order right away. You will not see this in a regular 24 season.
- Similarly, Jack's attempt to locate Margot by putting a virus on her arms dealer's computer system is interrupted literally at the last second by MI5 agents... but Jack is still able to take time out from the ensuing firefight to finish uploading it. Having half the episodes really does light a fire under these people to get shit done.
- Kate goes Murderous Thighs on a man torturing her, after ten minutes of strapado and electrical torture, before stabbing him to death.
- Bonus points for stabbing a man in front of her despite her hands being bound behind her.
- Another meta-example, doubling as Crowning Moment of Funny. President Heller tells his people exactly what everyone who watches this show wants to hear:Heller: Jack wants her, Jack needs her, Jack gets her.
- Jack tries to get Simone Al-Hizari to come with him, as her mother has sent a hitman to kill her. Unfortunately, she's still under the impression that her mother wouldn't hurt her. So Jack unceremoniously drops her in a hospital corridor and begins to walk away, finally convincing Simone that she's in imminent danger.
- Jack manages to escape Margot's hijacked drone in a massive car chase across a London suburb, narrowly avoiding multiple hellfire missiles. He manages to buy time to get out of the kill zone by driving under a bridge, stealing another car to switch vehicles, and jury-rigging the previous car so it goes off and looks like it's still being driven, causing Margot to waste her remaining missiles blowing the empty thing up, realizing what's happened only after it's too late.
- The death of President Heller, while a Tear Jerker, is also a Dying Moment of Awesome. He deduces that by turning himself in to Margot, no matter what she does, he will win. If she is true to her word and won't kill anyone else, then he has saved hundreds or even thousands of lives by sacrificing his own. If she lied and goes ahead with the drone strike anyway, then she will be seen for the liar she really is. It also helps that he was suffering the early stages of Alzheimer's Disease, and thus he wanted to go out in a blaze of glory with his memory still intact in order to protect innocent civilians, rather than slowly lose his mind, to the point where he may not remember his loved ones, until he eventually succumbed to the illness. He outwitted Margot simply by doing exactly what she said to do, and by doing the last thing she expected, simultaneously.
- And in the next episode, he's now two for two in surviving a Heroic Sacrifice he had every intention of being permanent.
- How Jack kills Margot and Ian Al-Harazi. The two have just figured out that Heller is still alive and use their remaining drone to take out a tube station. Ian is Genre Savvy enough to want to bail before they're found but Margot forces him to stay. Sure enough, Morgan and Ritter arrive with some other CIA ops and begin to storm the apartment complex where they're hiding. While they shoot it out with Margot's henchmen, Jack reppels down the side of the building and draws Ian's attention to the window of the apartment. Ian walks over to the window, where Jack grabs him and throws him out to his death! Jack then shoots Margot to wound her, and manages to redirect the final missile to harmlessly impact the water. Margot sneers at Jack that every death that occurred this day was on the hands of him and Heller. Jack's response?Jack: The only death on my hands tonight...is yours. (Throws Margot out the same window to her death.)
- Another plus of only having half a season: Navarro tries to escape CIA headquarters after being found out by telling a security guard to lock the building down. Normally, this would be the setup for him escaping to be the new Big Bad, but with only three episodes left, Jack is barely slowed down and soon catches up to him.
- Kate and Jack seamlessly work together to get Navarro to tell them how to find the MacGuffin of the day before his immunity deal can be signed, by making him think Kate's gone over the edge from his betrayal and Jack is the only one who can stop her from summarily executing him (and this is only about half an hour after she learned about Navarro and was naturally frothing at the mouth over it). Then Kate tells him with utter calmness that she's going to be watching his execution.
- Cheng Zhi proves that he's still Crazy-Prepared by assassinating the daughter of the Chinese consul and holding Audrey hostage to ensure that China and the US go to war.
- Jack, Kate, and even Mark Boudreau get one when they infiltrate Stolnavich's manor. Mark brides his way in, wearing a hidden camera. Once in, the CIA tech destroys the feed as Kate and Jack bust in, making quick work of his security detail. As this is happening, Mark fights off Stolnavich, who is trying to murder him. He's eventually able to take the diplomat down by sending the man crashing through a glass pane.
- Chloe O'Brian in a lorry with Cheng Zhi and his men suddenly grabs a pipe, takes out most of the guards and leaps from a moving vehicle! Up there with the M16 bit from Season 4.
- Jack decapitating Cheng Zhi with a katana. As cheesy as it may have been, it was incredibly gratifying.
- But before that, Kate reveals to Jack that Audrey has been shot. At first, he falls into depression and pulls out a hand pistol considering suicide. However, instead of ending it all, he puts the pistol away and goes into an Unstoppable Rage and murders all of Cheng Zhi's minions and then beat Cheng Zhi himself to near-death.
- Meta example for Kiefer Sutherland. It was four years since he had last played Jack, but picks it up again as if he had never left.- Information

Alternate Energy Technologies (AET) announces its market expansion initiative as it forms its latest strategic partnership with Green Plumbers USA. As part of this partnership, the two entities will design and execute a solar thermal training course specifically for plumbers to learn the installation best practices for solar water and space heating/cooling systems which are manufactured by AET.
More specifically, Green Plumbers USA will be initiating a national educational awareness and enrollment program, allowing their members to learn the processes of installing, servicing, and selling AET thermal heating/cooling systems, the only product suite on the market that is 100% American-made and federally approved. These AET products can be purchased directly online, and offer complete package solutions including racking and mounting hardware, thermal collectors, water storage tanks, and all components required for the installation.
“This partnership between AET Solar and Green Plumbers has the potential to bring affordable energy and water conservation solutions to customers throughout the US. This partnership represents the first time that a national plumbing organization has partnered with a US manufacturer to deliver quality and value to home and business owners alike,” said Andrew East, EVP of AET Solar.
AET has manufactured and provided products for more than 100,000 residential thermal system installations over the course of decades. The solar energy industry leader will work with the students of Green Plumbers during hands-on lab installation training, utilizing the same systems that they will sell and install to create realistic simulations and work encounters. AET will also provide students with the best practices our instructors have learned over decades in the industry.
"Green Plumbers has worked closely with AET Solar for quite some time now and the time to formally recognize our partnership and take the focus on solar to the next level was right. AET and Andrew East have been strong supporters of our educational program. It just made sense to move forward with a partner that has the same vision. Our Green Plumbers are looking for ways to increase knowledge and revenue and AET Solar provides a precise avenue to both. We look forward to working with AET Solar on making sure all Green Plumbers have the opportunity to expand their business with solar. This Partnership shows our commitment to the industry and a sustainable future for America," said Jon Cruz, EVP of Green Plumbers.
In this manner, Green Plumber USA members will occupy an advantageous position over other local plumbing outfits by being well versed in solar thermal technology, as well as being able to calculate the energy and monetary saving potential of the systems to prospective customers.
“Water, like energy, is a precious and underpriced commodity in the US; providing customers with conservation and production strategies, this consortium will proactively seek to rebuild stronger domestic infrastructures, while informing and educating customers on how to best manage that infrastructure,” concluded East.
AET manufactures solar thermal collectors, solar pool heating panels, water heating systems with tanks, pumps, controls, and other system components. AET is a pre-approved federal vendor and works with government entities, and is an Energy Star rated appliance. It also works with vendors to offer engineering and permitting assistance as well as financing options, and has more than 35 years of experience as a trusted industry name.

Last night while she was “approving” a comic, I was forced to disclose that the dialogue was pretty much verbatim (minus the foul language) from an incident that occurred in my youth. Which tripped a switch in my brain that was desperately searching for inspiration for today’s Top Ten list!
.
So here it is, ala Memory Lane…
.
Top Ten Smart-Assiest Things That Were Said To Authority-Type Figures:
.
1) First Psych Eval at age 13. (This one is at least partially my Dad’s fault, since he suggested the AWESOME come-back the day before.) When Doc failed to ask me the “trigger question” for my prepared punch-line:
Doc- “Why? Would you like to talk about your childhood?”
Me- “No. You were supposed to say, ‘Tell me about your childhood,’ so I could say, ‘Why? Didn’t you have one of your own?’”
.
2) Sometime under the age of 10. My Mother was at a follow-up visit with the Doc about a possible tumor:
Doc- “The good new is, it’s just a cyst.” Looking my direction, “What do you think about that, young lady?”
Me- Looking all thoughtful and such, “I always wanted a cyst, but I got a brother instead.”
(Yes, I DID start at a young age.)
.
3) While visiting the Doc about a SERIOUS “Unspeakable H” issue:
Doc- “You have an external blood clot that’s causing all the problems. We’re going to have to cut it out. Is someone with you that can drive you home afterwards?”
Me- “Nope. Just me.”
Doc- “You mean you drove here with these?”
Me- “No, I drove here with my hands and feet.”
(Can we say the Doc did NOT share my sense of humor?)
.
4) When I was 17 I was pulled over by a State Trooper for driving a “little” faster than I was supposed to be going. (Something like 69 in a 55? Pfft! I was late for curfew!)
Officer- “Also, were you aware your brake lights aren’t working?”
Me- “Umm…no. I didn’t know.”
Officer- “Why weren’t you aware of it?”
Me- “I don’t know about you, but I don’t usually stand behind my vehicle while applying the brakes.”
(WRONG ANSWER! Insta-ticket, my friends!)
.
5) While preparing for the Grand Opening of a new BW3’s, I was helping to ready the Bar. I called the District Manager (DM) and the Owner over:
Me- “Where are the Braille menus? You ordered them, right?”
DM- “I think so.” To the Owner, “Do you know where they are?”
Owner- “They’re in the office. I’ll grab them.”
Me- “While you’re in there, check and see if the menus for the Deaf are with them. You ordered them too, right?”
(I think I kept a straight face for two full minutes while the two of them panicked because no one remembered ordering the Deaf Menus. Then? I simply lost it!)
.
6) At the grocery store purchasing a 15 pound bag of cat food and a gallon of milk:
Cashier- Scanning milk, “Would you like your milk in a bag?”
Me- “No thanks.”
Watching cashier wrestle monster bag of cat food across scanner, “Can you please put that in a bag for me?”
(I only gave her look of panic a few seconds before I busted-up laughing.)
.
7 & 8) Cashing a $649.00 check at the bank:
Teller- “Is there any specific way you’d like this?”
Me- “I’d like 100 ones and the rest in pennies please.”
Teller- “Ha ha ha.”
Me- “No, really.”
(I gave her a good 10 seconds of panic before I let her off the hook. It was just too easy!
Next trip…)
Teller- “Is there any specific way you’d like this?”
Me- “In Russian Rubles.”
(They’ll just never learn…)
.
Me- “Umm…no. I’m calling from my toaster and it’s getting some pretty awesome reception!”
(DUH!)
.
10) Entering a Tattoo shop to get a tiny moon placed on the inside of my right wrist. Because I was determined to achieve White Trash status, I had a 3 year old and an 18 month old with me.
Guy- Looking at the offspring, “You want a tattoo for you?”
Me- “Nope. I wanted to get ‘If lost please return to…’ tattooed on these kids’ asses.”
(I think he was actually considering it before I clued him in to the fact I was JOKING!)
.
There ya have it, a solid 10 examples of my life-long quest to be the World’s biggest smart-ass! If you’ve got any good ones, I would LOVE for you to share!Thompson / Center 7mm - 08 Remington Stainless Steel Pro Hunter Pistol Barrel

A good 2013 resolution may be to make your money go further
Monday, December 31, 2012
There are different ways to accumulate wealth. You can earn more income or, when you make purchases, you can get more for your money. While earning more is nice, it might be easier to make your money go further.
Personal finance experts say the hardest part about being a smarter shopper is committing to it and not sliding back into old familiar patterns.
"Before you go to the supermarket or the big-box store, make a list of what you need and only buy those things," said Michelle Perry Higgins, a financial planner and principal of California Financial Advisors in San Ramon, Calif.
By sticking to your list, she says you can avoid purchasing things that waste money. "You'll be amazed how much you'll save."
Couponing
Coupons are another way to stretch your dollar. Again, it takes time and commitment to search out the savings. Daily deal coupon sites have recently made it easier, but Higgins warns they can also be a trap, if you end up buying things just because they are on sale.
"It's only a bargain if you already use the item in the coupon," she said.
The best way to get the most for your money is to research major purchases carefully. The Internet is a great tool for price comparisons and smartphones give you the ability to do it on the go. In fact, "showrooming" has become a new, hated trend in the retail industry because more consumers are using their phones to price check when they spot an item in a store they are considering purchasing.
Sometimes there are ways to cut recurring expenses. Is your cable TV continuing to go up? A number of consumers have reported good results when they call their provider and politely say that, due to rising costs, they are considering switching to another provider. Many times, consumers report, a provider will offer a promotional rate -- at least temporarily -- to keep your business.
Can you cut insurance costs?
If you think you might be paying too much for car insurance, call some competing companies and ask for a quote. Just make sure you are comparing the same kind of coverage you currently have with the coverage you are considering replacing it with.
When it comes to auto and homeowners insurance, the amount of the deductible influences the rate. The higher the deductible -- the amount you are responsible for paying for any claim -- the lower the premium. By assuming more of the risk yourself, you can reduce your payments. Just be sure you can afford to pay the higher deductible in the event you make a claim.
Household incomes have gone down over the last three years. For consumers trying to get ahead, stretching their dollars may make the most sense. But it requires doing some research and being willing to make some changes.
And the beginning of a new year is a perfect time to do that.

In honor of this theme song coming back let’s do a quick top 5. Nothing like an awesome theme song to properly set that “big game” mood.
5. NHL on ESPN
I actually forgot how awesome this song is until today’s news. So much intensity behind it. The fact the ESPN completely gave up on the NHL really does suck.
4. NFL on Fox
Gold standard for football themes.
Bonus Fox Injury Music – I’m not joking when I say I want this music to play at my funeral on perpetual loop. I don’t ask for a lot but I’m asking for this.
3. College Basketball
Little more applicable right now but if you played me this music in the middle of August it would get me fired up. Just washes you over with a million tourney moments seared into your brain.
2. Masters
The greatest nap music of all time. You hear this and you know 2 things. 1) Spring is here and 2) You’re going to spend all of Saturday and Sunday in and out of sleep while Jim Nantz softly whispers sweet nothings into your ear. A tradition unlike any other.
…
1. NBA on NBC
Might be a controversial number 1 selection but this one just holds too much weight. This is Michael Jordan. This is Charles Barkley and Patrick Ewing and Shawn Kemp, Hakeem, David Robinson and Orlando Magic Shaq. This is your childhood if you are between the ages of 22 and 35. Chills on chills.

Mongol by Uuganaa Ramsay
Uuganaa Ramsay's third child, Billy, was born with Celtic red hair, "Mongolian blue spot" birthmarks, and, she would soon discover, Down's Syndrome. In a disastrous attempt at reassurance, a doctor told her, "It may not be so obvious that William has Down's because of your ethnic background."
As she hurtled into a new role as advocate and activist, Ramsay found herself fighting racial ignorance in her adopted home of Scotland while reckoning with a different brand of ignorance from her native Mongolia, where disability is often blamed on parental wrongdoing or ancestral ties. As she reports in her lean, spare memoir, Mongol, her fight to keep a fragile baby with a hole in his heart alive would be impossible without a reexamination of her roots: "I needed to look back to my childhood and the very different Mongolian culture in order to move on in life."
Ramsay was born in rural Mongolia during the peak of the Socialist era, a time when posters of "Teacher Lenin" were stitched into wall-hangings and Buddhist shrines were hidden away. She affectionately recalls an upbringing that embodies the contradictions of life in a culture at the crossroads of civilizations. She was raised in a one-room ger, or yurt -- "we didn't know the concept of the word 'privacy' or 'personal space'" -- by well-educated parents who taught her to herd sheep and goats, clean intestines, distill vodka from yogurt, and read like a fiend. "My parents told me that I 'lost my ears' when I read... one night, I nearly burnt the ger down trying to finish a book."
Most of Ramsay's concise prose is as clear and quick-moving as the streams where she washed clothes as a child, her style a refreshing antidote to that of self-conscious memoirs swollen with emotional detritus. In the Mongolia of her memories, the goals are simple but the work is intense, life is aligned with natural rhythms, and families maintain strong and intricate networks of support. The reader is lulled by the sight of two little girls tending their herd under a cloudless, deep blue sky, waiting for their mother to signal dinner by hanging her red gown outside the ger, and men slaughtering animals by reaching inside them and holding their hearts until they stop beating. Using a rare metaphor, Ramsay writes of learning foreign languages in high school, "English was the new hot spice in the pot... A few weeks in and I was mixing my P's and F's, calling myself 'pine' and Nasa my 'priend.' My journey in speaking English started with no idea of where I would end up in the world." While Ramsay's growing yearning to go to the West is not quite fully examined, she makes it clear that she was far from alone in her desire: for her peers, "anything would do as long as it was abroad."
Mongol is dedicated to Billy Buuz Ramsay, and yet in his mother's homage to him, she reveals herself as a woman of extraordinary determination who filled her pockets with lists of English words and posted quotes from Dale Carnegie's How to Win Friends and Influence People on her mirror. She showed up to university in Ulaanbaatar every year lugging eighty kilos of goat cashmere to take to market and stretched meager savings by buying bottles of orange juice to sell outside of class. What shines through is always matter-of-fact, never self-aggrandizing: "I used to take a book and a dictionary with me while I was looking after our livestock [on semester break], inwardly annoyed with my parents but unable to say it to their faces. Instead, I'd mutter to myself, 'My friends are speaking English with tourists and I'm speaking baa baa with sheep.'" She got into a teacher-training program in London when she had the good faith to appeal a rejection, and there she met Richard, the Scottish man who would become her husband.
"Richard asked a lot of questions about Mongolia and we had fun dancing until midnight," Ramsay writes of the night she met him. "I felt comfortable around Richard and we were open and honest about our past and our thoughts on life." This lack of detail is the downside to much of Ramsay's prose. In other places, such as a passage about her first childbirth, her understated style lacks affect: "Oh boy, I had never experienced this kind of pain, and I was almost at my wits' end." Mongol avoids all melodrama, despite its serious subject matter, but a bit of exaggeration wouldn't hurt the author's style. Now that the hot debate on memoirists' responsibility to "the truth" seems to have simmered down to lively discussions on what "truth" might be and how to play with it, most readers of memoir expect to encounter fictional techniques. We expect writers to sharpen hazy memories into distinct scenes, to cut unnecessary summary and magnify the tension of more important events by embellishing them with dialogue, action and atmosphere.
When Ramsay does indulge in a scene, the results range from tender -- her shell-shocked husband, upon receiving Billy's diagnosis, offering her a bowl of potpourri to sniff -- to charming and fascinating. Of young men at a party, she writes, "They wore their caps at a jaunty angle, walking as though in a slow dance, dragging their feet across the floor, moving as if they had a hedgehog under their armpits and moving their heads as though they had a neck-brace on. They would compete to ask girls to dance... to waltz music played on the only Casio keyboard in the village." As an expatriate, Ramsay has that special ability to point out the quirks of her own culture as well as her adopted culture, and her exploration of privacy and personal space is especially intriguing. Why should she not let herself into her flatmate's bedroom to vacuum the floor, she wonders? And how, her parents question, can she possibly leave her little girl to sleep in a room all by herself?
These fascinating tidbits leave the reader with many questions. How does Ramsay really feel about British culture? She was shocked by comedian Ricky Gervais's infamous tweet that "two mongs don't make a right," but has she faced other, more subtle forms of discrimination as well? Which paradigms of her own culture does she struggle against, and do those relate to the struggles that she fights within herself? The struggle against nature that opens and closes this book, however, is documented with crystal clarity. While Billy did not survive, his life propelled his mother into a new calling as an activist. The ebook version of Mongol was released on International Human Rights Day, and Ramsay now blogs about preventing the doubly offensive misuse of that word. (John Langdon Down, the doctor for whom Down's syndrome was named, coined the term "Mongolism" himself, although he ironically was seen as ahead of his time for considering this "degeneracy" to be proof of "the unity of the human species.") Ramsay's message is catching on: she appeared in a full-page article in the Scottish Sunday Press beside the headline, "I can think of no other nationality used to describe a disability."
Considering that Uuganaa Ramsay did not begin writing until 2010, her accomplishments have been tremendous, and she is someone to watch, both as an artist and as an activist. She is currently writing her memoir in Mongolian. Given her declaration that speaking in her mother tongue makes her more emotional, one can only imagine the new layers that she may discover in her story as she tells it in the language that shaped her earliest perceptions. To this day, Ramsay also continues to post in a blog that she created in honor of her son: "So yes we did it Billy. You inspired Mummy and the story is being read by people around the world. You will live in people's minds."

Strikeforcing It Award EA Sports, for grabbing some of the UFC’s ad space to push their “EA Sports MMA” video game that features mythical creatures like Fedor Emelianenko and Nick Diaz.
File Photo
Missed Opportunity Award The UFC, for never once mentioning Octagon girl Arianny Celeste being November’s Playboy cover subject…yet bothering to plug a month-old UFC Magazine.
Building a Better Catchphrase Award Mike Goldberg, for working in “slip and rip” twice to describe a fighter dodging a strike and then countering. His verbal precision remains precise.
Is there such a thing as a perfect body type for MMA?
Watching the built-for-basketball Cyrille Diabate get thrown around by Alexander Gustafsson Saturday -- eventually tapping to a choke -- doesn’t encourage long, lanky fighters to pursue careers involving wrestling. It’s a common problem among athletes with stretched-out builds, who don’t possess a center of gravity friendly to defending tackles and instead offer long legs that collapse easily; fireplug fighters (Sean Sherk) might overcome that, but don’t possess the reach or physical real estate to tie fighters up on the ground.
Brock Lesnar got a genetic gift by being built like a brick wall with mobility and a sizable reach. He’s also a one in a million type. The prototype build might belong to St. Pierre, who isn’t weighed down by muscle, has functional mass, a powerful lower body, and enough fast-twitch fibers to switch levels before other fighters can react. If he’s one of the best fighters in the world, his parents are partially responsible.
Should more fighters emulate Akiyama?
Akiyama had the presence of mind to realize he was down two rounds to Bisping entering the third. And instead of doing what so many fighters do -- behave as though it were a competitive contest and act conservatively -- he used what little energy he had left to try and drop an anvil on Bisping’s head. At the bell, he more or less collapsed from fatigue and effort. Why more athletes don’t turn on the pressure when it’s clear they’re far behind is one of MMA’s bigger mysteries. At least Akiyama wasn’t ready to settle.
Do Saturday’s results hurt the UK MMA industry?
If three or four American fighters dropped bouts to international talent, few fans would fret over the “death” of US MMA. But because two of Britain’s more promising fighters lost Saturday, some are wondering whether the UK scene will ever be at parity with the rest of the world.
It’s a fair question -- the UK lacks any real interest in wrestling at the educational level, which means fewer dominant grapplers -- but one night doesn’t mean much over the long haul. Bisping is an impressive 20-3 in his career, with only one KO loss; Hardy went five hard rounds with GSP in a fight most expected him to get devoured in. Both men may benefit from a greater variety of training, but the UK is still one of the richer sources of talent available.
• Bisping told press following his bout Saturday that he considered himself only one victory away from a title shot, which would put him on a three-fight win streak. He’s due a lot of credit for an impressive career, but the only way I see him challenging for a title is as a fill-in for an injured contender. He has yet to put away a single top-ten opponent.
• 17,133 fans set a new attendance record at the 02 in London, swayed in part by the long wait between events in the UK -- it’s been nearly a year -- and the presence of both Bisping and Dan Hardy.
• Bisping and Yoshihiro Akiyama split $120,000 in Fight of the Night bonus money, which was Akiyama’s third in as many fights. You have to figure a guy with that many wars to his credit isn’t going to be a poster boy for longevity.
• Lost in the UFC weekend coverage: Ken Shamrock, who picked up a win over Johnathan Ivey in Louisiana. The untelevised win puts him at 2-6 in his last eight, a record I’m not sure even Shannon Ritch would want any part of.
• During a Q&A session, Zuffa co-owner Lorenzo Fertitta indicated his company had plans to put on a big show in Toronto in the spring of 2011, with an aim on setting a new UFC attendance record of 40,000-plus. If you think that would be the perfect time to settle the pound-for-pound debate by having St. Pierre face Anderson Silva, you’d be on to something.

Scott William Franklin, M.D. received his Bachelor of Science degree from Texas A&M University in 1990 and was a member of the Alpha Epsilon Delta Medical Honor Society. He attended medical school at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston and was graduated in 1995. During the medical school, he was nominee for the Audrey Murphy Award, runner up for the Gold-headed Cane Award for patient compassion and winner of the C. Frank Webber Award for Outstanding Clinical Research.
Dr. Franklin began his residency training at Louisiana State University Health Science Center at Shreveport in the specialty of Otolaryngology- Head and Neck Surgery. During residency, he was awarded the Joseph E Loewenstein House Officer Teaching Award and was elected to the Alpha Omega Alpha Honor Medical Society. He published numerous articles on various ENT topics ranging from surgical treatment of seporhinoplasty, airway management and head and neck tumor markers. Dr. Franklin successfully completed his residency in June 2002 and is board certified by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery. Additionally, Dr. Franklin is a Fellow of the American Academy of Otolaryngic Allergy with ABMS-Board Certification in Otolaryngology.
Dr Franklin established Georgetown Ear, Nose and Throat Center, P.A. in August 2002. The clinic offers a full compliment of adult and pediatric ENT services including comprehensive audiology and balance testing and allergy testing with follow-up immunotherapy treatment. Comprehensive audiological examinations are a diagnostic tool used by Dr. Franklin in the diagnosis and treatment of tinnitus and vertigo. Allergy testing, in combination with appropriate medical and surgical treatment options, allows Dr. Franklin to assist his patients with the control and prevention of sinus disease. Following an evaluation, Dr. Franklin discusses all findings and treatment options in detail.Earlier government check and health care than they are chancing it on the market.
Not everybody agrees. Yes, the program's rolls have doubled since the early 1990's. And it's not that disabilities have become so much more common. But most of that growth, they argue, can be explained by population changes. Women entered the workforce in droves, and they now qualify for disability insurance as a result. The Baby Boomers are getting older and hence more disability prone. It's not an economic story, they say. It's a demographic story.
Fine argument, but this really, really is an economic story. And one of the clearest illustrations of why is contained in a graph recently presented by the Social Security Administration's chief actuary. It shows just how tightly the size of the disability rolls have been tied to the health of the job market, ever since reforms in 1984 made it easier to qualify for the program.
Here's a quick tour: The red line is the U.S. unemployment rate. The blue line shows the number of workers awarded new disability benefits each year for every thousand who are eligible. But -- and here's the key -- it's adjusted to account for the demographic changes that have contributed to the program's growth. So what's it telling us? Ever since the early 90's, new disability awards have tended to rise and fall with overall joblessness. And, even accounting for the changing age and gender profile of the U.S. workforce, the overall award rate has risen by about half since the early 80's.
Upshot: The problem isn't just that there are more people in the workforce who are likely to end up disabled. It's that a bigger fraction of them are applying for, and getting, benefits, especially when the economy sours.
Here's another, simpler way of looking at the change, courtesy of Mathematica Policy Research. If men and women who were eligible for disability participated at the same rates they did in 1980, there would have been 2 million fewer former workers enrolled in the program by 2010 than there actually were.
The good news is that while demographics haven't necessarily fueled the entire disability boom, they might help keep it in check. As the Baby Boomers age and begin to collect Social Security retirement checks, they'll be whisked out of the disability program. That's why the chief actuary projects that the program's relative cost should dip slightly and level out at around 0.8 percent of gross domestic product.
The bad news, though, is that's still more expensive than we'll be able to afford. Right now, the disability trust fund is slated to go insolvent by 2016. In other words, there won't be enough money to pay out benefits at current levels, and people relying on the program will see their monthly checks shrink. It might be possible to avoid that plunge by tinkering with the with proportion of social security payroll taxes that flow into the program -- taking some from the retirement trust (which the baby boomers will need tomorrow) in order pay for disability benefits (which they'll need today). But obviously, that's not a workable long-term solution. That's why it's important to turn disability insurance into a program that helps more impaired Americans work, instead of paying them not to.Former Australia all-rounder Andrew Symonds announced his retirement from all forms of cricket on Thursday.
Symonds, who was signed up by Mumbai Indians last season for US $850,000, said he would not be able to take part in this year's Indian Premier League because his wife is due to give birth to his first child.
"Effective immediately, I am retiring from all forms of professional cricket.," the 36-year-old was quoted as saying by ESPN Cricinfo.
- Top-10 buys at the IPL V auction
Though Mumbai Indians' preparations for the fifth IPL could be hampered by the Aussie's sudden decision to call it a day, the Mukesh Ambani-owned franchise wished the player the best for his future.
"Andrew Symonds was an integral part of Mumbai Indians in Season 4 as well as our Champions League-winning team. He was a great team player and the youngsters always looked up to him for guidance. We appreciate and respect his decision and wish him very best in all his future endeavors," a Mumbai Indians spokesperson said.
Symonds played 26 Tests, 198 ODIs and 14 T20 internationals for Australia.
A radio interview, in which he targeted New Zealand's Brendon McCullum, was a factor in him being banned for the South Africa tour.
He retired from Test cricket to become a freelance Twenty20 specialist, playing for Queensland, Deccan Chargers and Surrey before joining Mumbai Indians.

Not all students are passive learners - for example kinesthetic learners need to move around and touch things to learn. Not all my lessons cater for all types of learners, but I do like to vary the style of teaching to ensure that students experience methods that suit them some of the time. I consider the activity that follows well worth the effort of having students move around and organize themselves to take measurements. The fact that it also involves history of mathematics is a big bonus.
Figure 1. Sixteen men leaving a church service measure their rood, as illustrated in the geometry book of Jacob Köbel (1460-1533), 1608 edition.
The word "rood" can be traced back to the Germanic "rute" and from there to the Old English rod. We know a rood today as a large crucifix often found beside entrances to old churches (for an example see Romsey Abbey (Hampshire, UK)). It is also a measure of land area of about a quarter of an acre or 40 square rods.
However the rood in which we are interested here is a linear unit which ranged from 16.5 to 24 feet in length at various times and in different countries. At 16.5 feet it was identical to the surveyor's rod. In a book on surveying by Jacob Köbel (1460-1533), he mentions that the surveyor should request that on leaving the church service 16 men should stop as they come out and stand in a line with their left feet touching the others, heel to toe. Then the length of the 16 feet gives the "right and lawful" rood. Dividing by 16 then gives an average foot. (Why 16? Perhaps this gives sufficient people to produce a valid sample and still makes division easy since 16 is a power of two and so four successive halvings gives the mean foot.) This method of random selection was used with my Year 7 class at the Mountbatten School, Romsey, UK as they left my lesson, repeated with our school staff (with their right feet) as they left a morning briefing, and then reiterated with some of the attendees at the Symposium X van de Historische Kring voor Reken Wiskunde Onderwijs (The historical group for arithmetic and mathematical education) in The Netherlands.
Figure 2. The teachers at The Mountbatten School, Romsey measure their rood.
The respective results were 4.14m, 4.40m and 4.68m, all well short of today's rod (5.03m) but longer than the old German rute (3.8m). Further data was obtained at the History and Pedagogy of Mathematics Conference held in Uppsala, Sweden during July, 2004. Here 16 mixed adults gave a result of 4.58 m and 16 males yielded 4.85m. This generated much discussion. Does this indicate that foot length has reduced over the last 5 centuries? (Perhaps manual labour in the fields leads to bigger hands and feet.) Has shoe length reduced? (The illustration shows the men wearing shoes, but these seem similar in shape to today's footwear.) How much does age matter? In future years we will do this experiment with different year groups and measure the sexes separately. We will then be able to use the data to compare the groups, an excellent opportunity for statistical coursework.
Opportunities for using history of mathematics and real data in the classroom do not come often. By involving pupils and using their data they feel ownership of the data and are eager to see how they measure up to other groups. Readers who send me their results (pransom@btinternet.com) will receive a complete set of the data sent to me in due course. Please let me know the age, sex (female, male, mixed) and geographical location of the data sent. If enough data is received, there may be scope for a wide range of statistical investigation. With a large enough data base, means and standard deviations can be found and ages and/or sex can be compared.2010 Arrow DD2 kart $5,000Classifieds for karts, kart parts and accessories.

2010 Arrow DD2 kart $5,000
by Micheal Harris » Sun Sep 29, 2013 12:48 pm
I’m selling my DD2 kart because I do not have time to use it. I bought it from Dallas Karting Complex almost 2 years ago. I never did get a chance to race it, just practiced a few times. DKC completely rebuilt the motor from top to bottom with new gears shortly after i puchased it from them. After the motor was rebuilt I was able to ride it enough to break in the motor. After that it did sit for awhile, so I did want to give it a clean bill of health before I put it up for sale. So it when back to DKC. They put a fresh battery on it and cleaned the carb. I just picked it up from them on 9/10, also I have the receipt to prove it. As for extras it will come with the micron 4 with the E box, a ribtech carbon fiber seat., a ratio rite fuel jug, k1 shoes and a k1 suit if they will fit you. It will come with the motor sealed and a passport. I can send photos if your interested. If you have any questions feel free to give me a call Jason at 469-556-2756

Once thought to be on the verge of extinction due to the incursion of all-in-ones (AIOS), otherwise known as multifunction printers (MFPs), single-function scanners are going strong. They've survived by focusing on specific user needs. Many photo scanners, such as the Epson Perfection V600 Photo and HP Scanjet G4050 Photo Scanner, provide high-quality scans of photographic film and slides as well as prints, while the modestly priced Canon CanoScan LiDE 100 should do well in scanning that shoebox full of family photos.
Offices can benefit from a document scanner such as the Fujitsu ScanSnap S1500 that can scan business cards as well as other documents. The Epson WorkForce GT-1500 has a 40-page automatic document feeder (ADF), as well as a letter-sized flatbed that will let you scan book or magazine pages. Almost all business scanners include optical character recognition (OCR) software, that will read paper documents and convert them into digital files. One unique scanner is the Plustek BookReader V100, which converts pages into audio files, a boon for libraries, particularly those that serve the visually impaired.
Featured in this Roundup:
Canon CanoScan LiDE 100
($59.99 direct)
The Canon CanoScan LiDE 100 is one of the few remaining scanners aimed at home users who are primarily interested in scanning photographic prints.
Epson Perfection V600 Photo
($249.99 direct)
The Epson Perfection V600 Photo offers high-quality scans for prints and both 35mm and medium-format film, plus an exceptionally easy-to-use scan utility.
Epson WorkForce GT-1500
($349.99 direct)
The Epson WorkForce GT-1500 is a bit slow, but it's affordable enough to make it an attractive choice if your small office needs a document scanner that includes a flatbed.
Fujitsu ScanSnap S1500
($495 direct)
The Fujitsu ScanSnap S1500 is the most impressive ScanSnap model yet, but it doesn't provide a standard scan driver, which would give it more flexibility.
HP Scanjet G4050 Photo Scanner
($200 street)
The HP Scanjet G4050 offers six-color scanning for excellent scan color and does a good job on both prints and film, including mounted slides.
Plustek BookReader V100
($700 street)
The Plustek BookReader V100 offers a complete solution for libraries or similar institutions that want to convert printed material to spoken form for their visually impaired patrons.

I went through my odd balls and found a partial skein of Red Hearts Stripes. The ball band was missing but I recognized it as the Cancun colorway. This yarn is a light worsted. I knew it would take forever to make something out of it, so I took out my Red Hearts Crystalites P/11.5 mm hook, doubled the yarn, so that I was working with 2 strands and decided on the extended double crochet stitch to make the work speedy. I also wanted a mindless pattern, so that I could watch a movie while I crocheted. I named my scarf Alternating Shells and V's. It's a two row repeat. Super simple! As a side note I also used normal worsted, Red Heart Super Saver with doubled strands as an experiment, and that worked out just as well.
Materials: Yarn of choice, any worsted weight yarn. I used Red Heart Stripes, 3 oz. If you're using Super Saver you can double 2 different colors for a nice look.
Plastic Crochet Hook, size P/11.5 mm. I used the one from my Crystalites Set
Gauge: 3 rows =5 inches
Size: 53x5 inches
Extended Double Crochet (edc) Yarn over hook, insert in indicated stitch, pull up a loop,3 loops on hook, yarn over and pull thru one loop, 3 loops on hook, (yarn over and pull thru 2 loops) twice.
Here is a photo tutorial for a visual look at the edc:
Instructions:
Row 1: ch 11, edc in 6th ch from hook, (ch 3, edc) in same st, skip 4 chs, 7 edc in last ch, ch 5, turn
Row 2: In the 4th dc (this is the center stitch of the 7 edc), (edc, ch3, edc) in 4th dc , 7 edc in ch-3 sp, ch 5, turn.
Row 3 (edc, ch 3, edc) in the 4th edc, 7 edc in ch-3 sp, ch 5, turn.
Repeat row 3 until you either run out of yarn or it is the length you want.
Last row: do not ch 5 when you turn, ch 1, instead. Sl st across each edc and ch st. Fasten off. Weave in yarn tails.About the Book

Maine Yacht Center seeks to expand parking, outdoor boat storage
PORTLAND — Maine Yacht Center is looking to expand outdoor boat storage and parking at its Kensington Street marina.
To do so, the city must rezone a strip of grassy land that runs along the St. Lawrence & Atlantic Railroad tracks to Interstate 295. The Planning Board will hold a public hearing Oct. 13 on the requested change from residential to light industrial zoning and issue a recommendation to the City Council.
"We need some more space," Maine Yacht Center General Manager Brian Harris said. "We've always been constricted."
The contract zone would allow the yacht center to demolish a vacant, single-story office building and use the land as an outdoor storage area for boats where owners could conduct light maintenance activities from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m.
According to city documents, rezoning the land would allow 18 additional parking spaces. Outdoor storage for boats less than 90 feet tall would be allowed, but without vertical stacking.
According to the minutes of a Sept. 23 neighborhood forum, residents were concerned about any increase in noise associated with the expansion. They also questioned whether existing trees would have to be removed.
Harris said the yacht center is taking steps to address the concerns of the neighborhood, including potential noise associated with people working on their boats. Such work would include seasonal maintenance and minor repairs, but not major structural or engine repairs, sandblasting, pressure washing or overnight lodging.
"The work is going to be minimal and controlled," Harris said. "The neighbors just wanted to make sure the landscaped buffer was going to be done tastefully and that it was going to be effective in providing a real buffer. So we assured them that would be the case."
The Maine Yacht Center is full-service marina with 80 boat slips.GreenFuel Algae CO2 Recycling Project With Aurantia Enters Second Phase at Spanish Cement Plant
GreenFuel Technologies Corporation, the leading developer of algae farming technologies that recycle greenhouse gas emissions, and Aurantia, SA today.
“After evaluating the key players in the algae industry, there is no question that GreenFuel is leading the race to grow algae at scale using industrial greenhouse gas emissions,” said Rafael Naranjo, CEO and Chairman of the Aurantia Group. “We believe algae hold great promise for Spain as they can be harvested daily, rather than seasonally, use water very efficiently and do not require arable land like other crops.”
The project began with a Field Assessment Unit (FAU) from GreenFuel for the construction, delivery, and initial operation, which has successfully grown a variety of naturally occurring algae strains in the Jerez sunshine using Holcim flue gases. The second phase of the project commenced with the successful inoculation and subsequent harvests of a 100m2 prototype vertical thin-film algae-solar bioreactor.
“Algae are a very promising solution to diminishing oil reserves, escalating oil and food prices and climate change caused by greenhouse gas emissions, a fact that is underscored by our growing partnership with Aurantia,” said Simon Upfill-Brown, who recently joined GreenFuel as CEO from Haltermann and Dow Chemical. “The project at Holcim with Aurantia is a significant milestone in our strategy to commercialize GreenFuel’s algae farming technology. In fact Aurantia has already identified several thousand hectares of land in the Iberian Peninsula suitable for the deployment of GreenFuel’s technology.”
The next phase of the Aurantia-GreenFuel project at Holcim will be the construction of a 1,000m2 algae greenhouse and harvesting facilities adjacent to the cement plant. In the meantime, GreenFuel and Aurantia will continue to test algae growth rates with the cement plant’s flue gasses.
About GreenFuel Technologies Corporation
GreenFuel develops algae farming technologies that economically recycle industrial greenhouse gases to grow algae for use in high-value feeds, foods, and fuels. Through partnerships with power plants and other motivated experts, GreenFuel has completed several pilot installations at host facilities in the US and Europe. The most experienced company in the emerging algae industry, GreenFuel is on track to deliver the first commercial-scale installation of a closed-system algae farm. For more information, please visit and read the FAQ.
About Aurantia Group:
In addition to algae, Aurantia is currently involved in a wide range of other renewable energy projects including solar technology. With thirty years experience managing advanced engineering projects, Aurantia Group specializes in a number of fields including: municipal solid waste treatments; landfill degasification; combined heat and power plants; sea water desalination plants; and the whole cycle of waste water treatments including sewage sludges.

The NY Review of Books has printed a reply to William Nordhaus’s refutation of the claims of the climate denialists, that I discussed at earlier post. Nordhaus responds to their reply. I will let these speak for themselves.
I wrote more recently, on March 15th, on Bill McKibben’s essay, framed as a book review, on fracking. In To Frack or Not to Frack, I took exception to some of McKibben’s premises. Most of all, what I find particularly disappointing in some of the activism these days, particularly in the anti-fracking movement, is the near-total disregard for the efficacy of environmental regulation. This is part of the argument that John Deutch makes in his response to McKibben’s review. Deutch, a former top agency official at both Energy and Defense, and also CIA Director, chaired the DOE committee that reviewed fracking’s problems and offered solutions. McKibben responds to Deutch as well. As much as I respect McKibben’s work over many years, it really bugs me that he, along with too many others, seems to categorically reject the notion that government can, and has so often proven, get the job done.Library JournalAndrews recounts his life in Dublin, where he was born in 1901.

Then, if you have a system crash due to a registry error or some other type of configuration file error, you can do the "F8 thing" (which still works on Win98, BTW) to boot to a command line, or boot from floppy, and run ERD from your backup directory to restore those files. I maintain several generations of ERU backups on all my Win95/98 machines in seperate subdirectories under \ERD, so I can always get back to a configuration that works. Every time I am going to make a change to my system (including installing some questionable software packages), I run a fresh ERU backup in a new subdirectory. I also make an ERU backup of the final "factory" configuration on all machines that we sell. This is very handy because I can often help a customer over the phone recover from a system crash, saving a service call. ERU is also somewhat customizable; you can edit ERU.INI (once you've copied it to your hard drive) to backup any other files in your \WINDOWS directory that you might want to save. You can also edit ERD.INI to only restore certian files, if you know which files got corrupted. Very handy. IMHO, this is the _best_ utility Microsoft ever made for any version of Windows... and they don't even tell you it's there! Go figure. There is also a GUI-based registry backup utility called CFGBACK on the Win95 CD that is useful, but it doesn't always work as it should. I have never had ERU fail. Hope this info helps, even if it isn't satellite related.... :)Theatre blog + Doctors

First Nations:
Blackfoot would be in this area throughout most of the 1700s and they migrated south and west. The Gros Ventres would
be found in this area in the early 1800s who moved southward around 1815 and then there would be Plains Cree in this area.
Before 1850, this area was accessed through the Fort Walsh - Moose Jaw, Boundary Commission Trail, and Fort Walsh -
Fort Qu'Appelle Trails. In the late 1800s Fort Walsh - Red Deer Forks, Maple Creek - Red Deer Forks, Fort Benton -
Fort Walsh, Red Deer Forks - Swift Current and Fort Walsh - Maple Creek - Swift Current Trails also served this area.
The Fort Walsh - Wood Mountain Trail was used at the turn of the century.
The Swift Current Gen Web Region has the unique geographical feature of Cypress Hills which contains the site of Fort
Walsh and a rich and colorful history. For years Cypress Hills was a sacred area where peaceful meetings could take
place. Around the 1860's, Cypress Hills was known as 'Whoop Up' country.
This was essentially a Blackfoot area, with American traders of Fort Whoop Up, Fort SlideOut, Fort Standoff,
Fort Robber's Roost, and Fort Whiskey Gap. Cree, Assiniboine and Mountain Stoneys were also affected with the trade of
whisky and rapid fire weapons at this time. "Wolfers" (hunters and trappers) as well as American traders met in this area.
1873 saw
Métis
settling in the hills where a previous Hudson Bay Company fort had been built by Isaac Cowie in 1871. Isaac Cowie is
better known for his writings in The Company of Adventurers. This area called Chapel Coulee was later named
Chimney Coulee marking the remains of the chimneys of this settlement.
On June 1, 1873, Wolfers from Fort Hamilton following up on horse thieves massacred about 16 Nakoda (Assiniboine) people. This
became known as the
Cypress Hills Massacre.
By 1876, the only Bison left to sustain the first nation traditional life style were to be found in the Cypress Hill
area. Following the Battle of Little Big Horn, Ta-tanka-I-yotank (Sitting Bull) and 4,000 Hunkpapa Sioux refugees
headed north to Cypress Hills.
Fort Walsh (built in 1875)
gave law enforcement to this area as a base for the Royal Mounted Police in 1878.

Settlement:
The 1863 report of John Palliser that the Great American Desert extended North of the United States border into Canada
forming the Palliser triangle discouraged homesteading settlement in this area. Southern Saskatchewan, known as the
Provisional District of Assiniboia, North West Territories
(Map from the Atlas of Saskatchewan)
prior to 1905 is represented by
Swift Current,
Moose Jaw, and
Weyburn GenWeb Regions hosted many
American ranchers.
In the late 1800s
Americans
from Texas, Montana, and Arizona herded cattle to the Cypress Hills, Big Muddy Area. Manitoba Land Investments
Corporation was an American land company.
American ranching companies were established in Southern Saskatchewan between 1881 and 1906 after the decline of the
buffalo and Canadian leasehold legislation was passed to promote ranching, some of the company names were:
Olivier's Ranch NW 15-41-25 on Fort Qu'Appelle Touchwood Trail,
McKinzies' Ranch near Basin Lake,
Venne Ranch in Menaginous Hills,
Turkey Track (A.J. Tony Day) one of several ranches near Hallonquist, Sk,
the "76" near Swift Current (10 ranches of the "76" between Swift Current and Calgary, Ab of these 10 ranches they were mainly between Maple Creek, Sk and the U.S. Canada border),
Matador Murdo MacKenzie north of Rush Lake,
Gull Lake Ranching Company (of James G. Millar),
Circle Diamond spread in the flat of Frenchman Creek, and
Wayne Ranch (run by Campbell McCutcheon).
American ranches prospered around Swift Current, Medicine Hat, and Maple Creek, supplying horses for the Boer War in
1900 and for the 1896 Klondike Gold Rush. Many Montana Ranchers in the Eastend area left after the devastating winter
of 1906-07.

It's really nice to have a guy to text, luckily for me I was texting a guy I liked and he ended up liking me too. He is currently my boyfriend. It's great to text/ talk to a guy you like because your conversations are endless. Late night texts or calls. I usually Skype my boyfriend and we would fall asleep together on it. I never really run out of things to talk about with him. It makes you happy and every time he texts you, you automatically get excited.00|00|0

What do you talk about tThe Infinite Spider-Man is a series of mini-essays exploring Marvel’s options for the future of their most popular character. It’s an updated version of an earlier piece written prior to the publication of the One More Day storyline. As the character’s romantic life figures into many of the determinations regarding the management of the books, I spent an absurd amount of time dealing with the issue of whether Spidey should be married. So fair warning on that.
Later sections deal with villains and schedules, so feel free to skip ahead if that’s your interest.
The series starts with musings on the awesomeness of Spider-Man. There’s also an explanation of why “The Infinite Spider-Man” was chosen as the title for this piece.
A few years ago, I came to the conclusion that the Spider-Man books could be better. That was the impetus for the earliest version of this series.
While considering what could be changed, I pondered two questions about the spider-marriage. Is Spider-Man’s marriage worth discussing at all? On the flip side, was it such a significant part of the series that it clearly wasn’t worth tampering with?
Eventually, I came to the conclusion that changing the spider-marriage could have been good for the title.
At the point I considered the advantages and disadvantages of a particular status quo: If Peter Parker was married to Mary Jane without either of the two obviously getting any older. I considered the stories that Marvel can only tell under those circumstances..
And then I considered the advantages to Peter Parker being single.

SAVING GRACE
Provocative series SAVING GRACE ends its summer run with gripping mid-season finale as
Grace finds an all-too-personal connection to a murder case
"A Language of Angels" � Monday, Sept. 17, at 10 p.m. (ET/PT) � TV-MA-LSV
The squad investigates the murder of a young woman who was tortured by her killer. Elements of the crime � cuts on the woman's body, a word scrawled in blood on the door, the victim's activities just before being abducted � all remind Grace of a crime that happened 11 years ago, a crime that hits eerily close to home for her. Meanwhile, Rhetta hypothesizes that the items Earl leaves behind after his angelic visits to Grace might have some sort of hidden meaning. She begins to investigate what that meaning might be, even going to death-row inmate Leon Cooley to see if Earl has left any items for him. Rhetta is then shocked by what she discovers as she begins putting things together.

Class name: Instruments external pressure applicator pneumatic cuff
Publication date: 2009-12-24
Patent application number: 20090318953
Abstract:
A dressing for applying compression to a wound in a patient includes a
bladder having a non-deformable end wall and a deformable membrane. The
dressing may include a flexible web having an adhesive layer on one side
thereof for securing the dressing to the patient so as to hold the
bladder against the patient's skin. Upon inflation, the deformable
membrane projects towards the patient's skin and exerts pressure on the
wound to reduce the flow of blood from the wound.
Claims:
1. A dressing for applying compression to a wound in the groin of a
patient, comprising:a deformable membrane defining a cavity having an
open end;a substantially non-deformable member connected to the open end
so as to define an inflatable bladder having a substantially enclosed
space defined by the deformable membrane and the substantially
non-deformable member, the bladder having a deflated condition and an
inflated condition; andholding means for holding the bladder against the
skin of the patient in a position substantially overlying the wound
without circumscribing the leg or torso of the patient.
2. The dressing as claimed in claim 1, wherein the holding means includes a flexible web connected to the substantially non-deformable member and projecting outwardly therefrom.
3. The dressing as claimed in claim 2, wherein the flexible web extends radially outward in all directions from the bladder.

CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
[0001]This is a continuation of application Ser. No. 11/043,350 filed Jan. 26, 2005, which is a continuation of application Ser. No. 10/397,785 filed Mar. 26, 2003, which claims the benefit of the filing date of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/368,013 filed Mar. 27, 2002, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference herein.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0002]The present invention relates generally to a device and method for compressing a wound in a patient caused by any one of a number of medical procedures. In a particular embodiment, the present invention is directed to a device and method for compressing and sealing a puncture wound in a blood vessel of a patient caused by a medical procedure.
[0003]In certain medical procedures, such as cardiac catheterization, dilation.
[0004.
[0005]After a procedure, for example, counterpulsation, has been completed, the sheath must be removed and the wound closed. Often, this can be accomplished simply by the application of digital pressure, generally augmented by the use of a conventional pressure dressing, until hemostasis is achieved. Customarily, pressure must be applied for at least one half hour, and frequently for much longer than that. In addition, during this period the patient must be immobilized, lest movement interfere with the closing process. Because of the pressure required, the time during which it must be applied and the need for immobilization, the procedure is painful and uncomfortable. It also requires the prolonged personal attention of a health care professional. Finally, wound closures accomplished in this manner are prone to open unexpectedly long after closure appears to have been completed. Patients are therefore often required to maintain bedrest, oftentimes in the hospital, for 24 hours or longer.
[0006]In addition to the need for applied pressure to seal a puncture wound in an artery or blood vessel of a patient, there are other medical situations in which the application of pressure to a particular region of a patient's body is required. For example, there may be a requirement for pressure to stanch bleeding or reduce hematomas following biopsies, ambulatory dialysis, insertion of intravenous needles, emergency procedures and other such situations.
[0007]Although devices have been developed to address these situations, and particularly the difficulties associated with achieving hemostasis of an artery or blood vessel, these devices have met with various degrees of success and oftentimes create new difficulties. There therefore exists a need for a device for applying compression to wounds in patients which is inexpensive, effective, easy to use and comfortable for the patient, and which overcomes many of the drawbacks of the prior art devices.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0008]The present invention addresses these needs.
[0009]One aspect of the present invention provides a dressing for applying compression to a wound in a patient. The dressing includes an inflatable bladder having a non-deformable end wall and a deformable membrane connected to the end wall so as to define an enclosed space therebetween. The bladder has a deflated condition in which the membrane is adjacent the end wall and an inflated condition in which the membrane is spaced from the end wall. Holding means are provided for holding the bladder against the skin of the patient in a position substantially overlying the wound without circumscribing the leg or torso of the patient.
[0010]The holding means may include a flexible web connected to the end wall of the bladder and projecting outwardly therefrom. The flexible web may extend radially outward in all directions from the bladder and may include a layer of adhesive on one surface for adhering the flexible web to the skin of the patient.
[0011]The bladder in the inflated condition may decrease in size in a direction away from the end wall. In preferred embodiments, the bladder in the inflated condition may have a frusto-conical or frusto-pyramidal shape.
[0012]The end wall may be formed from a rigid material, such as plastic, and may be transparent. The end wall may also be formed from the same material as the deformable membrane, and may be molded integrally with the deformable membrane.
[0013]Another aspect of the present invention provides a method of applying compression to a wound in a patient. The method includes providing a dressing including an inflatable bladder having a non-deformable end wall and a deformable membrane connected to the end wall so as to define an enclosed space therebetween; applying the dressing against the skin of the patient in a position substantially overlying the wound; inflating the bladder to an inflated condition, whereby the inflated bladder exerts pressure on the wound to reduce the flow of blood from the wound; and applying manual pressure to the dressing against the skin of the patient so as to achieve hemostasis of the wound.
[0014]The method may further include providing a flexible web connected to the end wall of the bladder, the flexible web having a layer of adhesive on one surface thereof, and adhering the flexible web to the patient's skin.
[0015]The bladder in the inflated condition may decrease in size in a direction away from the end wall. In preferred methods, the bladder in the inflated condition may have a frusto-conical or frusto-pyramidal shape.
[0016]The providing step may include providing the dressing such that the end wall and the deformable membrane are formed from the same material. The providing step may further include providing the dressing such that the end wall and the deformable membrane are molded integrally with one another.
[0017]Preferred dressings in accordance with the present invention and compression methods employing same reduce the time in which health care professionals must exert manual compression to a wound, while at the same time increasing patient mobility and comfort.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0028]In certain procedures, for example, intra-aortic balloon pumping ("IABP"), percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty ("PTCA") and angiography, as best seen in FIG. 1, a catheter or other device 10 is inserted through a puncture wound 14 and into a blood vessel or artery 16, most frequently, the common femoral artery in the groin area of the patient's leg 20. Puncture wound 14 includes a tissue channel extending through a layer of tissue separating artery 16 from the patient's skin. Often, the insertion of device 10 is facilitated by passing the device over a guide wire 22 and through a guide cannula 24. When the procedure (e.g., counterpulsation) has been completed, the device (e.g., the catheter), the guide wire and the guide cannula must be removed and the puncture wound closed. Although puncture wounds of the sort made by percutaneous procedures will generally, after removal of all cannulas and catheters, be in the nature of slits, for ease of understanding, they are depicted in the drawings herein more as holes. The shape of the puncture wound, however, is not critical.
[0029]It should be understood that the subject invention is independent of the nature of the medical device being used to treat the patient. Accordingly, the term "catheter" is used herein in a very generic and broad way to include not only "catheters" in the strict sense, but any device that is inserted into the body.
[0030]Similarly, the subject invention is independent of whether a particular blood vessel is involved, and if so, which blood vessel. While it is anticipated that the femoral artery will be the most commonly used blood vessel for many percutaneous procedures, other arteries as well as veins might just as easily be involved.
[0031]A compression dressing 100 for use in sealing puncture wound 14 is shown in FIGS. 2 and 3. Dressing 100 includes an expandable bladder 102 having an upper wall 104 and a lower membrane 106 enclosing an internal region 108. Upper wall 104 is formed from a material that will resist substantial deformation at the pressures to which bladder 102 is inflated during normal use. Thus, for example, upper wall 104 may be formed from a rigid plastic material, a rigid metal or some other relatively rigid material. Preferably, upper wall 104 is formed from a transparent plastic disc so that the inflation of bladder 102 and any leakage of blood from puncture wound 14 can be readily observed therethrough.
[0032]In contrast, membrane 106 is formed from a pliant, air-impermeable material such that membrane 106 will deform upon inflation of bladder 102. In one arrangement, membrane 106 may be formed from the same material as upper wall 104. For example, in a one-piece molding operation, upper wall 104 may be formed with a relatively thick cross-section such that it will not substantially deform at the pressures to which bladder 102 is inflated during use, and membrane 106 may be formed with a relatively thin cross-section such that it will readily deform upon inflation of bladder 102. Alternatively, upper wall 104 and membrane 106 may be formed from different materials altogether.
[0033]Bladder 102 in the inflated condition may have any shape capable of exerting sufficient pressure on the patient's leg to occlude bleeding. In a preferred arrangement, however, membrane 106 has a shape such that the inflated bladder 102 will taper from a larger size to a smaller size in the direction toward the patient. For example, in the inflated state, bladder 102 may have the shape of an inverted pyramid or cone. Such shapes will concentrate the pressure exerted by compression dressing 100 on a localized region of the patient, desirably a region overlying the wounded artery. Bladder 102 in the inflated condition may alternatively have a frusto-pyramidal or frusto-conical shape, thereby avoiding any pain to the patient which may result from having the inflated point of bladder 102 forced against the patient's skin. Other shapes are also contemplated herein. Moreover, it will be appreciated that by varying the wall thickness and shape of membrane 106, various levels of force and conformity with the contour of the patient's skin may be achieved.
[0034]Membrane 106 may be treated with an anti-bacterial coating in order to minimize the occurrence of infections in puncture wound 14 resulting from the use of compression dressing 100. In addition, membrane 106 may be treated with any number of materials known to those skilled in the art to aid in the healing of puncture wound 14 or to reduce pain or complications.
[0035]Bladder 102 is secured to the lower surface of an attachment web 110. Web 110 is preferably formed from a flexible material which will readily conform to the contour of the patient's leg. Particularly preferred are materials that are permeable to air, such as woven fabrics and perforated plastic sheets. The attachment of bladder 102 to web 110 may be made by an adhesive; mechanical means, such as sewing or stapling; ultrasonic or solvent welding; and any other known techniques. In a preferred arrangement, the edges of bladder 102 are encased within one or more layers of adhesive as discussed below in connection with FIG. 9. An aperture 112 may be formed in web 110 in a region overlying upper wall 104. Aperture 112 may enable substantially the entirety of bladder 102 to be seen through web 110 to assure proper placement and operation of compression dressing 100.
[0036]Web 110 may extend outwardly from bladder 102 in all directions so as to define a continuous region around bladder 102 by which dressing 100 may be attached to the patient's leg. However, web 110 need not extend outwardly from bladder 102 by equal amounts in all directions. Thus, as shown in FIG. 2, web 110 may include substantially perpendicular arms 114 and 116 which extend radially outwardly from bladder 102 by a greater extent than the remainder of web 110. Although FIG. 2 shows arms 114 as shorter than arms 116, that is not necessarily the case; arms 114 may be longer than arms 116 or arms 114 and 116 may have substantially the same length.
[0037]The bottom surface of web 110 (i.e., the surface confronting the patient's skin) includes an adhesive layer 120 for adhering dressing 100 to the patient's skin in the region surrounding puncture wound 14. Thus, dressing 100 is adhered to the patient and does not require that arms 114 or 116 circumscribe the body of the patient, in particular the leg or torso of the patient. Adhesive layer 120 may entirely coat the bottom surface of web 110. Alternatively, adhesive layer 120 may be applied only in discrete regions of the bottom surface of web 110 such that the portion of web 110 adjacent bladder 102 is held tightly against the patient's skin. Moreover, as noted above, adhesive layer 120 may be used to adhere upper wall 104 of bladder 102 to attachment web 110, such as shown in FIGS. 4 and 5. A removable protective sheet 130 may cover adhesive layer 120 during shipping and handling. As explained below, protective sheet 130 is removed from dressing 100 prior to its use.
[0038]A mechanism 140 for inflating bladder 102 is provided on the upper wall 104 of the bladder. Mechanism 140 includes a tube 142 having one end connected to upper wall 104 by a connector 144 and communicating with the interior of bladder 102 through an aperture 146 in upper wall 104. A one-way valve assembly 148 is connected to the other end of tube 142. Any known inflation mechanism may be used to inflate bladder 102. One such inflation device is a squeeze bulb, such as squeeze bulb 150 shown in FIG. 6, which may be connected to mechanism 140 through valve assembly 148. Other inflation mechanisms include, but are not limited to, compressed air canisters, a centralized source of air distributed through the wall or ceiling, or a gas generated through a chemical reaction within bladder 102, such as by crushing chemical-containing vials, etc. Alternatively, bladder 102 may be inflated by a fluid, such as saline, in order to provide weight to the dressing and reduce the compressibility of the inflated bladder.
[0039]The application of compression dressing 100 to a patient and the operation thereof will now be described with particular reference to FIGS. 6-8. After protective sheet 130 has been removed and before bladder 102 is inflated, the dressing 100 is applied so that adhesive layer 120 contacts the skin of the patient, and so that bladder 102 is positioned over or just upstream of puncture wound 14. Squeeze bulb 150 or another inflation device may then be used to inflate bladder 102 to a desired pressure. Since upper wall 104 resists deformation as bladder 102 is inflated, as the inflation material fills internal region 108 of bladder 102, membrane 106 will be pushed away from upper wall 104 and toward the patient's skin. As this occurs, the adhesive layer 120 on web 110 holds bladder 102 in tight relationship against the skin of the patient. As a result, the inflation of bladder 102 causes the patient's skin and underlying tissue and artery to be compressed, thereby stanching the flow of blood through the tissue below.
[0040]Dressing 100 may be used with or without an initial period of manual compression. In that regard, manual compression may initially be applied to the wound site to achieve hemostasis before application of dressing 100. After hemostasis has been achieved, dressing 100 may be applied and bladder 102 inflated. Alternatively, manual compression may be performed directly over dressing 100 after its application to the patient but before it has been inflated. In a further variant, manual compression may be performed directly over dressing 100 subsequent to inflation of bladder 102. In this regard, membrane 106 may be formed with a shape which will facilitate the ease of applying this compression. In all of these methods, once manual compression has been completed, the inflated bladder 102 would continue to maintain pressure on the puncture wound to maintain hemostasis.
[0041]An alternate embodiment of a dressing in accordance with the present invention is illustrated as dressing 200 in FIG. 9. Dressing 200 is substantially the same as dressing 100 described above, but differs in the shape of the deformable membrane and in the method of securing the bladder to the attachment web. Thus, dressing 200 includes a deformable membrane 206 which is more rounded than membrane 106, eliminating any sharp corners or edges which could cause discomfort for the patient. Also, dressing 200 includes a first layer of adhesive 220 which substantially coats one surface of attachment web 210 and adheres bladder 202 to the web, and a second layer of adhesive 280 which covers the peripheral edge of membrane 206 in the region in which the membrane is connected to upper wall 204. With this arrangement, the outer edges of upper wall 204 and membrane 206 are encased within adhesive so that no free edges are exposed to the patient's skin. It will be appreciated that the same effect can be achieved without adhesive layer 280 having the same outward extent as adhesive layer 220, or without adhesive layer 220 having the same outward extent as adhesive layer 280.
[0042]Variants of dressings 100 and 200 will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art. For example, rather than having the attachment web adhesively secured to the patient's skin, arms 116 of the web may be formed with sufficient length that they can extend around the patient's leg and connect to one another, such as by tying, clasps, hook and loop fasteners, etc. Alternatively, the bladder may be secured to a patient's leg by a belt, strap or other device positioned over or operatively connected to the upper wall thereof.

RepliesRobert Pattinson appears to have moved on from Kristen Stewart after he was spotted over the weekend ending a night out by driving off in a car with “Disturbia” actress Sarah Roemer.
Rob ducked his head to avoid paparazzi but hung out with Roemer in a very public celebrity watering hole, suggesting that he has one of the most open relationships in the world with Kristen, or they don’t have any relationship at all.
Roemer, 27, was already waiting in the car when the 25-year-old actor came out of the bar and jumped in with her. Of course, she could have just been giving him a ride home. Believe it?
Rob may have been playing defense with Roemer, sidling up with her to thwart advances by other women.
“Rob was literally fending off advances from girls, left and right,” one onlooker told X17-Online.
“Every female in the bar wanted to get close to him and for the most part, he politely ignored them but one girl caught his eye and she left with him!”
Pattinson and Roemer spent the evening with friends in the bar, before the group made their way to Soho House in West Hollywood, which is a closely watched by roaming paparazzi.
Both Pattinson and Roemer were snapped by photographers leaving.
Oddly, Stewart, 21, went as far as she’s ever gone in confirming her relationship with Rob during interviews while promoting “Breaking Dawn, Part 1,” the next to the last film in the “Twilight” vampire series.
She confessed to the UK edition of GQ magazine that she had an “English boyfriend.”
The two have been rumored to be an off-screen couple going back to their first movie in 2008.
During a promotional stop in Sweden with Twilight co-star Ashley Greene, Rob also let slip that Kristen was his girlfriend.
It happened when he was talking about Edwards initial reaction to Bella’s pregnancy.
“The story is no one really knows what she’s pregnant with… I mean it would be a very strange way to react in reality,” he said laughing.
“I mean if your girlfriend gets pregnant, and you’re like ‘What is that?'” he says, laughing hysterically.
Ashley quickly corrected him: “No, your wife,” she said.
Roemer is also the polar opposite in looks compared with Kristen, who at 21, may be too young to settle down. So what gives?

he’s not cheating on Kristen. rob is friends with sarah. gosh chill! he does have female friends outside of the dAAmn twilight cast!

There were 3 other people hanging out too but I know that doesn’t fit what you want to say because it’s not salacious then.
There were like 5 people in the car. Not just Rob and the girl – quit making crap up. The pictures clearly show a car load of people!
The car was full of other people…what is wrong with you people..Kristen went out with Hedlund. And would he really bring a girl to a public place where everybody see’s him…get a bloody grip on your stupid lies…he just came back from London

If you really believe that..well then I’ve got a bridge to sell you. Rob is a cheating dirtbag. It’s been rumored for awhile. There’s just photographic proof this time is the difference.
@emma “There were 3 other people hanging out too but I know that doesn’t fit what you want to say because it’s not salacious then”. – when he is with Kristen there is 3 or more people with them too. What’s your point? If you’re going to base romantic dates on how many people accompany him then by all accounts this was a date.Zacks Investment Research Lowers GECINA (GECFF) to Hold

Over the years we've lavished a lot of love on the Neanderthals, arguing that the popular image of them as dumb, primitive brutes is wrong. In fact they were intelligent, engaged in a lot of complex behaviours, and may even have been able to speak
However, the image of sophisticated Neanderthals attending dinner parties wearing their fancy jewellery has just taken a knock: one of the central pieces of evidence may not be reliable.
In 1959 in the Grotte du Renne in central France, archaeologists found a wide range of ornaments and tools, including some that look like primitive jewellery. Think of it as a Stone Age Tiffany's. Later, a study showed that the artefacts were jumbled up with Neanderthal teeth, suggesting that the Neanderthals made them some time between 35,000 and 40,000 years ago.
But if a new study of the remains is correct, the ornaments have nothing to do with Neanderthals.
In this week's Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, a team led by Thomas Higham of the University of Oxford used radiocarbon dating to nail down the ages of the remains..
Evidence that Neanderthals used tools is widespread, but the Grotte du Renne offers some of the best evidence that they also created jewellery. Higham thinks his findings call that evidence into question, saying:
One-third of the dated samples are statistical outliers, and this must tell us something about the confidence with which we ought to be associating the remains with one another. We think that the most likely explanation for the results is that our dates are reliable, but that we are dating materials that have moved after their original deposition.
Some scholars have suggested that successive occupants at the Grotte du Renne levelled the site, and certainly that they dug holes into lower layers, raising the possibility of mixing of materials.
In one respect, Higham's findings should not come as a surprise. The tools and ornaments in the Grotte du Renne look like those made by anatomically modern humans, so we might expect that they - not Neanderthals - were the artistes.
This leads Higham to suggest that a key piece of evidence for Neanderthal sophistication has fallen:
The evidence from the Grotte du Renne constitutes by far the most comprehensive set of evidence in support of the use of ornaments by Neanderthals, and therefore is the most important dataset concerning Neanderthal cognitive abilities with respect to ornamentation and symbolism. The only other evidence in France is from a site called Quincay, in which there are only four pierced teeth, but these have never been properly published and it is difficult for us to assess their robustness.
A recent discovery in a Spanish site showed that Neanderthals there may have used pigments. We don't know what for, but they were identified on shell fragments in a Mousterian site.
However, Francesco D'Errico of the University of Bordeaux, France, who has studied Neanderthal artefacts for many years, is still convinced by the evidence for Neanderthal jewellery from other sites. Higham's dating is not necessarily the last word, he says, because we cannot be sure that the samples were not contaminated over the millennia:
The parsimonious reading of Higham's results is that the idiosyncrasies are due to insufficient decontamination, rather than to significant reworking of the archaeological layers. In my view many of their results, in particular those from the lower layers of the site, do not represent the true ages of the dated objects, but are just minimum ages... So the findings cannot be interpreted as proof that a significant reworking took place at the site.
So either the samples are contaminated and we can't trust the dates, or the later inhabitants of the cave jumbled them up for us.
I would suggest settling the debate with the enthusiastic use of hefty stone clubs, but that would be positively Neanderthal.
Is it possible that artifacts found in post Neanderthal deposits were discovered and re-used by modern humans or possibly were inspired by original Neanderthal art? If the two shared the same shelter at different times artifacts that one group used could have been adopted and re-used by the succeeding occupants.
Items dated later but found deeper in the matrix would definitely suggest some disturbance of the deposits though.Remember when your mother told you to make sure you looked presentable when you left home and put on clean underwear just in case and yadda yadda you stopped listening, 'cause what did she know?

Is he hurt? Is he just trying not to injure himself and phoning it in? Double teamed or not (not double teamed at all today), you'd think he would be a huge difference maker and I don't want to hear from Beaty that it opens up a space somewhere else if he is doubled. If DA can't deal with a single or even double team at this level, you don't get the feeling that he'll fare well against pros. Especially with his slow, delayed jump at snap. He was also completely out of position eith wrong angle on pass play he got burnt on. It's sort of bad when the only memorable highlight you have in a game is actually a lowlight (crucial unforced penalty). Disappointing.Can Your Life Insurance Company Refuse To Pay A Claim? (Part 2)
In my last entry I discussed circumstances that might cause a life insurance claim to be denied during the first two years of the policy: fraud and material misrepresentation—and—suicide. I also discussed how a claim might be denied due to premiums not being paid. With only one exception, these are the only conditions that could allow an insurance company to refuse to pay a claim. The exception is that some states allow fraud to be a legitimate reason for claim denial or reduction even after the two year contestable period. If you lie about your age or smoking habits, or have an impostor take your medical exam, depending on the state, these may be cause for a claim denial or reduction at any time.
When a claim is denied as a result of premiums not being paid, if the insurance company failed to send premium notices to the policy owner, it is wise to consult with an attorney who specializes in insurance law to determine if there is a chance to overturn the claim denial.
There are situations that can cause a death claim to be delayed:
Death is the result of suspicious circumstances.
If there is reason to believe that one of the beneficiaries may have been involved in the death, the claim may be delayed. However, if the death is after the two year contestable period and the policy is in force, the death benefit will be paid (exception in some state could be fraud as stated above). State laws won’t allow it to be paid to the beneficiary who is convicted of a crime of having caused the death of the insured. Proceeds instead will go to other named beneficiaries or to the estate of the deceased.
Minor children named as beneficiaries.
When minor children are named as beneficiaries the insurance company must wait for the state courts to notify it to whom the proceeds are to be paid.
Ambiguity in beneficiary designations.
Adult children might be named as beneficiaries but it may not be clear to whom the proceeds should be paid if one of those children has died. Should that child’s portion be distributed to the surviving children, or to the heirs of that deceased child? And what about children that were born after the original designation was made? It’s important to let your agent know exactly how you want this handled, so the beneficiary designation is properly worded.
Delay of a payment does not automatically mean it is a refusal to pay. There are many reasons why an insurance company needs a little extra time to assure that the proceeds are being paid out correctly. In most states the company must pay interest during the time it holds the money.
If you think an insurance company is wrongfully denying a claim you should consult an insurance law attorney.
Next I’ll be discussing the history of life insurance company failures in the United States and how this effects policyholders of the failed companies.Kickstarter, the website that popularized crowd-sourced fundraising for poor shmoes with dreams but no money, has recently been embraced by more high profile entrepeneurs.

Familiarity: I've put it through the wringer
When I first bought these i wasnt 100% sure what to expect. Maybe a liquid, maybe some sort of gel, but what you actually get is some weird apple-sauce textured fruit mash. The texture was offputting at first, but that was due to expecting something completely different. Once you know what these will be like... theyre actually really good. Its like a mixed fruit apple sauce that delivers tons of energy. I take one of these on the drive to the mountains and feel it working within 30 or so minutes. Drop the redbull and heavily caffeinated energy drinks, have some fruit stuff instead.1-800-387-9010 or 416-929-3000 | info@masterfile.com

Shown is Finch Paper’s Len Cronin, one of five foresters who manages more than 160,000 acres of land.
GLENS FALLS, NY—Tucked inside the picturesque backdrop of the Hudson River in upstate New York, Finch Paper is seeking to show customers and potential clients that it boasts value beyond the mid-cap status it holds among the multitude of U.S. paper providers.
Finch sought out a core collection of industry media and analysts to tour its paper-making facility here, as well as traipse a 1,000-acre parcel of managed forestry to not only outline its expertise in the realm of offset and digital printing papers, but provide an up-close demonstration of environmental responsibility in action.
The former was not nearly as eye-opening as the latter, which is not to say that Finch fell short in its quest to illustrate its capabilities and abilities to meet the evolving needs of its target market with high-quality opaque uncoated offset paper and burgeoning digital offerings, among others. But the forestry tour was a watershed event for this country, singularly unique from both accessibility and educational standpoints.
The intimate size of the group only enhanced the educational value of the experience, as Finch forester Len Cronin provided a blow-by-blow account of the short- and long-range planning science that is far more impressive than the paperwork tedium entailing forest management certifications. As Cronin explained, Finch had long been practicing the prerequisites needed to garner certifications from the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) and Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI) programs—the company had those bases covered—long before “going green” became the cause du jour.
Ironically, perhaps the lone adjustment Finch needed to make in order to meet the standards was maintaining more…paperwork.
Equipped with degrees in forestry management, Cronin showed the group an impossibly detailed schematic of the parcel that entails the old Smith Farm, purchased in 1911 and reverted back to forest land (the company manages 166,000 acres in the Adirondack region in all). Oak and pine dominate the dozen species of trees on Smith Farm, and while less than 2 percent of the land managed is actually harvested, Finch uses 100 percent of every tree that is taken. The wood that is not incorporated into Finch product is sold to other markets, used as anything from landscaping mulch to household furniture.We created Pandora to put the Music Genome Project directly in your hands

Morrissey, who turned 19 Friday, had an outstanding season with the Western Hockey League’ Prince Albert Raiders, leading all WHL rearguards with 28 goals and 73 points and is the Eastern Conference nominee for the junior league’s defenceman of the year award.
The Calgary native has a reputation for leadership — he was the Prince Albert captain this season— and smarts, on and off the ice. He was the Canadian Hockey League’s Scholastic Player of the Year in 2012-13 after maintaining a 92.4 average in his Grade 12 studies.
The six-foot, 185-pound blueliner also played for Canada at the most-recent world junior hockey championship, scoring a goal and adding two assist in seven games.
“He’s an outstanding skater, really smooth,” said McCambridge, who got an up-close look at Morrissey during the Jets’ prospects camp last year. “His puckhandling skills are at a real high level. Obviously, the offensive side is in his game, but from what I’ve seen, he can also play a two-way game.
“Here’s a guy who can come in and help with the offensive side and possibly we can see where he fits on special teams.”

- Column: If it’s not broke ...
Morrissey, the 13th overall pick in the 2013 NHL draft, handled big minutes for the Raiders this past season, but McCambridge said that could be the basis for his biggest adjustment to the pros.
“The thing for guys coming up from the junior ranks, the ones who are 27-, 29-minute guys, is that they pace themselves at the junior level because of how much ice time they get, whereas in the American league, at the professional level, there always has to be tempo to your game.
“It’s not a matter of trying to make sure the pace of your game is at a certain point so you can manage the minutes you’re given.
“It’s making sure your A to B is at a real high intensity all the time, every shift.
“They can’t pick their spots here.”
Comrie was the 59th overall pick of the last Entry Draft, but probably would have gone higher had he not underwent season-ending surgery on both his hips in January of 2013.
The operations and resulting down time certainly didn’t affect him this season.
The Edmonton native — who is the half-brother of former NHLers Mike and Paul Comrie — played 60 games with the WHL’s Tri-City Americans, posting a 26-25-9 record, 2.57 goals against average and .925 save percentage that ranked second amongst all league goaltenders. He’s seen as a leading candidate to play for Canada at the next world junior championships.
“First impression is that he’s a strong technical goalie and that he’s really dialled into the game. He really switches gear and looks driven,” said McCambridge.
With Hutchinson in Winnipeg and Jussi Olkinuora having been returned to the Ontario Reign of the ECHL, the six-door, 175-pound Comrie is one of two netminders on the St. John’s roster, the other being Tyler Beskorowany.
“With the goalie situation here, we’ll see how it plays itself out here,” said McCambridge, “but we’d like to get him (Comrie) some games also.”
The IceCaps play Friday night when they begin a six-game homestand, their last one of the regular season, as they take on the Springfield Falcons in the first of back-to-back games at Mile One Centre.
Morrissey has been assigned jersey No. 6, while Comrie gets 30. Both have already been signed to entry-level NHL deals with the Jets, but will operate under amateur try-out deals with St. John’s.
“I got a chance to talk to them today,” said McCambridge Tuesday. “They’re both really good kids and they’re excited to be here.
“That’s a great way to start.”

I did it all a few months back & all seems to work ok, however something seems to be not right with the electric brakes to the camper trailer. When I had a similar setup in my previous vechile (Kluger) the camper trailer brakes would lockup with ease, with the Prado setup I cant get them to lock even though I've replaced brake magnets / machined drums & installed heavier gauged wire.

Fish tales: Move over Ariel, the Hudson finally has its very own mermaid — thanks to Tarrytown’s Mark Siegel, whose stunning new graphic novel is enchanting readers near and far
Artwork courtesy of First Second Books
Mark Siegel insists that he’s never been particularly interested in mermaids and that he didn’t set out to author a book. Instead, his 399-page graphic novel Sailor Twain (First Second Books, $24.99) “started out as turmoil that I couldn’t ignore.” His answer to his late 30s life angst? Journaling and sketching on his commute into Manhattan. “And one day, there she was,” he says. That was in 2005; he immediately began crafting the story, which is set mostly on a steamboat on the Hudson in 1887. In 2010 he put his charcoal sketches online — three pages a week — and admits that “something kind of magical happened” when he began interacting with his devoted blog readers. Now, the book is a New York Times best-seller; and Siegel, a Brown University grad who once considered himself a starving artist, is the darling of the literary establishment (John Irving called his book “a gripping novel with compelling characters”). Heck, Millbrook Vineyards even named two wines after the book. Here, Siegel sounds off on his amazing journey.
On founding First Second Books, an imprint of Macmillan Publishing that focuses on graphic novels: I started that in 2005. It’s going very well; I now work with some of the greatest talents around. But I always knew if I shelved my own projects I’d regret it for the rest of my days. So I negotiated a four-day work week right from the start.
Getting the book done: It has meant getting up very, very early. Most of the work was done between five and seven in the morning. My top speed was three or four pages a week.
On choosing charcoal: I’ve worked in charcoal just for my pleasure since I was pretty young. But it is not recommended for comics because it is very messy.
Uncovered during research: There are mermaids throughout all of history. Did you know that the Starbucks logo is a mermaid? Look at it — it’s a double-tailed mermaid. They’re everywhere.
On keeping the story historically accurate: I spent a lot of time at the historical societies and going up to places like Poughkeepsie and Albany.
Blog readers helped out: A couple of them were total steamboat geeks. One of them would pipe up to say, “No, no, no, the pistons in the engine room are definitely Mississippi River pistons. An engine room on the Hudson would not be like that.” I would go in and fix it to be accurate.
On including his blog fans: I was working on a scene with a costume ball and I said to the readers,“If you want to send me a photograph of yourself, you can have a cameo.” Now there are about 100 faces in this book that are actual readers.
Will there be a movie? There’s been talk. I won’t believe a word of it until I’m eating popcorn in the theater.
Cast as the captain? At one point on the blog the readers started doing a poll; it was Johnny Depp.
Could the story have taken place on another river? No! They’re inseparable. The Hudson has a certain kind of Gothic quality to it.
On loving Tarrytown: I like the village life. It’s not so suburban; you can almost not have a car. There is a real community there.
The universal appeal of the mermaid: I’ve gotten to the point where I think there is a truth to the mermaid. It’s not just fantasy. If you’ve been alive for any length of time, you’ve heard the call of the mermaid. You either went down with it or you may have resisted it, or maybe you’ve even been a mermaid to somebody else. It’s interesting stuff.

Cleveland, Ohio's The Sidekicks have always had it in them to make a record like this. It’s their most polished, mature, and best to date. There is not one bad track out of the eleven here. It’s musicality at its most honest.
Taking the influences from past acts like The Replacements and Elvis Costello, The Sidekicks created 2009’s Weight of Air and left a huge mark in punk/orgcore circles. But here we are in 2012, and the band has shown that they can create their own sound and leave any naysayers by the wayside. This should now be known as “Sidekicks music.”
Singer/guitarist Steve Ciolek dominates this album. His falsetto singing is the best he’s ever done and he deserves whatever sheer warranted praise he gets for his voice. Not to be forgotten is second guitarist/singer Matt Scheuermann, who provides substantial backup melodies that help carry the album along without one slow, boring moment. There is energy here. It’s evenly filtered throughout the entire collection of songs and it shows immediately once opening track “DMT” starts playing. But then there is second track, “Grace,” and it’s even better—if not one of the best. What makes the song one of the best comes from the musicianship and arrangement of vocals. It’s competent, well played, and catchy: the right ingredients to make a good song.
Things slow down a bit with “1940’s Fighter Jet” which proves to be the most emotional statement. The lyrical tone is one of stress, longing, shame and other tones of highs and lows. The layout is more somber and gentle, but then it builds to an almost epic climax before shutting off and keeping inside itself. Ah, but then halfway through we come to album highlight and what seems like the best Weezer tribute ever done called, “The Whale and Jonah.”—it sounds like how Weezer used to be. It has this grasp that’s straight out of the best, most infectious pop moments from The Blue Album and Pinkerton. And that isn’t even the stopping point here because the remaining tracks rock just as hard. The closing double punch of “Baby, Baby” and “Daisy” brings the whole project full circle, the latter song being a perfect closer, and with that, one of the year’s best albums.
This album should be given to any and everyone around you. It has this breath of life that’s been missing in today’s music. There’s no BS here. This is a heartfelt and captivating album that should bring this band the due credit they deserve from the public. If that doesn’t happen, well… music be damned.

Style: Straight-ahead/MainstreamI decided my first post of 2009 would be a look back at 2008 ... at the dishes that didn't work. I suppose that seems negative, but each recipe was a lesson learned, and hopefully helped me become a better cook. Maybe posting these will help you avoid the mistakes I made!
2. Anne Burrell’s Fregula with Braised Butternut Squash -- I'm sure this is a good recipe. I just killed it by having a heavy hand with red pepper flakes. Lesson learned: go easy on these little flakes, and TASTE before you add more!
5. French Onion Soup, Cooks Illustrated 2008 – I didn't get any photos, but the recipe was an involved process and none of it went as described. First, you cook the onions in the oven. The result was supposed to be onions in a lot of liquid, but mine went completely dry. Then you put the pan on the stove and sautee the onions, deglazing them three times. All it took was for me to turn my back on the pan for a minute and the bottom of the pan became a burnt mess. I remedied the situation by dumping the onions into a separate pot, but all the flavor that would have come from the deglazing process was lost in the burnt crud. The result, of course, was so-so. The disaster was my doing … but in any case, it’s an involved recipe that calls for a lot of attention.
9. Roasted Red Pepper Remoulade Sauce from The Southern Living Cookbook – This recipe called for 1/4 cup of chopped fresh parsley, and that amount overwhelmed the whole recipe. I tried adding various things to perk it up but the sauce was just blah. I served it to company with crab cakes, because I didn't have an alternative. The rest (and wouldn't you know, it made tons) went down the drain.
Coming up next: my Top 10 of 2008!

Well, at least each "flop" was a lesson learned! Here's to some fantastic new recipes to share in 2009!
Happy New Year!
It always stinks when something doesn't turn out as well as you'd hoped. Thanks for the great cookie recipe! I'm sorry that I said your son was a pain in the butt! :-)
I have a great rocky road candy recipe from Nigella Lawson's "How to be a Domestic Goddess". They don't melt in my hands, which is good b/c my hands are normally sweaty. It's on my site somewhere.15-18 Oct 2013

 (USA)There’s only one reason Lance Armstrong spoke to Oprah Winfrey this month: To begin the process of rehabilitating his image. Doing so, he hoped, would help pave his way back into competitive sports.
After all, if his goal had been merely to confess to doping, he could have just released a written statement, as he had so many times before.
Therefore, the effectiveness of his Oprah tell-all has to be judged in that context, of whether or not it helped to rehabilitate his image. It didn’t. Worse, it did more damage than good, making his decision to appear with Oprah a disastrous one.
The Anderson Cooper clip below features video of one of Armstrong’s most shockingly awful moments.
A poll from my blog (admittedly unscientific) found that readers thought he did more harm than good in the interview:
A more scientific poll, conducted by Survey USA, mirrored this blog’s results, finding that only 17 percent of respondents thought he was being completely honest.
Among other reasons, Armstrong failed because:
1. He Didn’t Come Across As Contrite: In my original review, I noted that Armstrong seemed genuinely moved by the pain he had caused his family, but not terribly concerned with the pain he caused the many people he had bullied for many years. His attitude made many people, including me, wonder whether he is a sociopath.
2. He Still Looked Like a Bully: He laughed when asked about the wife of one former teammate, telling Oprah that although he had called her “crazy” and “a bitch,” he didn’t call her “fat.” In another stunning moment, he admitted that he couldn’t remember everyone he had sued because he had sued so many people.
3. He May Not Have Come Clean: Although Armstrong denied doping after 2005, there’s strong evidence that he’s still lying. He also denied offering hush money to the anti-doping agency USADA, although officials claim he did.
4. He Wasn’t Willing to Sacrifice Anything: As any parent knows, a bad act is usually followed by a commensurate punishment. Armstrong doesn’t seem to get that. He actually uttered this jaw-dropper to Oprah about whether he should be allowed to compete again: “I think I deserve it.”
Editor’s Note: After two-and-a-half years of featuring the five worst video disasters of every month, I’ve decided to make a change and focus on only the worst one of each month. That will allow me to analyze each month’s worst video disaster in greater detail.

New York Knicks forward Rasheed Wallace will need surgery to repair a broken left foot and doctors expect him to miss the next eight weeks of the NBA season, the team announced on Wednesday.
Wallace, a 38-year-old big man who came out of retirement to join the Knicks this season, has not played since December 13 and figures to miss the remainder of the regular season and start of the NBA playoffs with the fracture.
In 20 games, Wallace averaged 7.2 points and 4.2 rebounds for the Knicks. The four-time NBA All-Star won an NBA title with Detroit in 2004.
Wallace has averaged 14.4 points, 6.7 rebounds, 1.8 assists and 1.3 blocked shots in 1,108 NBA games over 15 seasons with Washington, Portland, Atlanta, Detroit, Boston and the Knicks.

After all, two of Muller's former Springbok colleagues have now bagged winners' medals to add European success to the extensive collections both Bakkies Botha and Danie Rossouw gleaned from their years of playing back home.
Even though the Ulster skipper has been around these parts longer than his two now even more decorated South African contemporaries, he has, of course, yet to add anything glittering to his sideboard in east Belfast.
"With the squad they (Toulon) have they should win things and they did," is the second row's rather brisk reaction to being reminded of what Botha and Rossouw have achieved and the fact that this Ulster squad have still to make the transition from trophy bidders to winners.
"For a squad like ours it's been a process and for a couple of seasons now we've been trying to build.
"But it all comes down to this (today's RaboDirect PRO12 final against Leinster at the RDS) so you couldn't ask for a better opportunity and of course it's all about one thing, winning the silverware."
Indeed, except that, yet again, it just happens to be Leinster who are providing the opposition.
You recall Muller last May, in the aftermath of the tanking Ulster had taken from Leinster in the Heineken Cup final, speaking about the fact that Joe Schmidt's side were simply too good and that there had been little any opposition could have done to live with the southern province that day.
Funnily enough, Muller isn't to be found trumpeting a likely repeat of that outcome now even though Leinster have already captured the Amlin Challenge Cup with a typically attacking-orientated display last week which, he concedes, is testament to their undoubted talents.
"They've got a quality side and have just won the Amlin and they've six Lions players in the squad so there's no secret to it, they are a brilliant rugby side.
"But look," he states referring to the experience of last May's European final, "Twelve months in rugby is a very long time and I think that as a squad we've grown quite a bit.
"The experience is now there, the hunger is there, the ability is there and so is the quality," the 32-year-old Southern Cape native says with some conviction.
Though all of the above could also easily be applied to their opponents, Ulster's belief ahead of the RDS showdown has been built upon rather more solid-looking foundations than usual with added reinforcement through having Tommy Bowe and Jared Payne bringing greater cutting edge than 12 months ago.
Getting the better of Leinster twice in the regular PRO12 season has been of notable importance with last March's backs-to-the-wall effort to win for the first time in Dublin for 14 years hailed as a seminal moment in what was then a stuttering league campaign.
"To achieve that was something special," agrees Muller before quickly moving to avoid tripping up with a few potentially tactless words over a game that ended in some confusion when referee George Clancy went to the TMO for Leinster after he had blown the final whistle.
"But having said that, we know if we go down to the RDS and if we're not 10-15 per cent better than the last time we played them in the round-robin we just won't achieve the result we want.
"In big games like this you get maybe two or three opportunities and if you don't take these opportunities then you're not going to win.
"That's where they've been so impressive over the last few seasons. Nearly every time they get an opportunity they get their seven points," he says.
And that's the worry for Ulster, as though they have been winning, their consistency of performance throughout recent games has tended to ebb and flow and this tendency, if repeated, will be ruthlessly exposed by a high-achieving Leinster side focused on a European and PRO12 double.
"Sometimes the accuracy hasn't been there," admits Muller whose third season here has been interrupted by injuries and has already been somewhat deflated by the disappointing European quarter-final exit to Saracens.
But there is still a chance to capture a trophy to bring some return on Ulster's investment, ending the seven years since the last title was secured while also avenging the 2011 RDS knockout encounter between the sides which saw Ulster go down in the then Magners League semi-final.
It has, of course, been a traumatic season and the devastating loss of Nevin Spence, along with his brother Graham and father Noel, will, as always, be on the players' minds come the game, though Muller downplays it when asked if this will be of any greater significance come the final.
"He (Nevin) hasn't left our thoughts since September so there is nothing that will change for us as a team.
"There's a reason why we have his initials on our shirt and it will be exactly the same on Saturday where once again we can realise how fortunate we are to play this game and enjoy life and to do what we love," he says before returning to on-field matters.
"If we don't win on Saturday the season will be a massive disappointment for us," admits Muller who recently signed on for one more year up until summer 2014 and is doubtless feeling that his time to achieve notable success here is probably running out.
"So for us all there's one objective and that's to win silverware. If not it's a disappointing season, end of story."
He adds: "But look, we're going out there to win and to show something for all our efforts over the last couple of seasons.
"We'll have to be absolutely brilliant if we want to beat them and anything less than that won't be good enough."
The captain has spoken.Press release from PR Newswire

Introduction This document specifies the 'tn3270' Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) scheme, that is used to designate the access to the resources available via Telnet 3270 mode (TN3270), as described in RFC 1041 [RFC1041] (especially, see Section 4 of RFC 1041; visit RFC 1576 [RFC1576] for TN3270 practices), and Telnet 3270 Enchanted mode (TN3270E), as described in RFC 2355 [RFC2355]. The 'tn3270' URI scheme was firstly mentioned in RFC 1738 [RFC1738] as used in URIs that designate the accessIs and does not have any guidelines for registration of this scheme. Since there is no any acceptable specification of 'tn3270' URI, there is a risk that somebody might try to implement it with some new, possibly undocumented, syntax, just by looking at IANA registry. In order to minimize such risk, this document gives precise definition of syntax, semantics and use of this URIs and registers the corresponding scheme. It also updates RFC 2355 [RFC2355], RFC 1738 M. Yevstifeyev Expires September 27, 2011 [Page 2]

'tn3270' URI Definition The 'tn3270' URI is used to access services that are provided via available via Telnet 3270 mode (TN3270), as described in RFC 1041 [RFC1041], and Telnet 3270 Enchanted mode (TN3270E), as described in RFC 2355 [RFC2355]. In fact these protocols are a modified form of Telnet [RFC0854]; see their specifications for details. Note: This document does not specify the TN3270 and TN3270E services themselves, but only the URI scheme for them. There already is the 'telnet' URI scheme [RFC4248], that designates the access to resources available via usual Telnet [RFC0854]. The syntax of 'tn3270' URI is similar to that of 'telnet' one (except the <scheme> part) and takes the form of <tn3270-uri> rule below (given in ABNF, as described in RFC 5234 [RFC5234]): tn3270-uri = "tn3270:" "//" authority ["/"] ;the 'tn3270' URI takes the form ;tn3270://<userinfo>@<host>:<port>/ ;that is formally defined via the <authority> The <authority> rule is specified in RFC 3986 [RFC3986]. If <port> (in the <authority>) is omitted, it SHALL default to 21, as registered in [PORTREG]. The final character "/" MAY be omitted. The <userinfo> (in the <authority>) is assumed to provide information for authentication using RFC 2941 [RFC2941] Telnet Authentication option. 3.

IANA Considerations IANA is asked to update the registration of the 'tn3270' URI scheme using the following registration template (see [RFC4395]): URI scheme name: tn3270 Status: Permanent URI scheme syntax: see Section 2 of RFC xxxx URI scheme semantics: see Section 2 of RFC xxxx URI scheme encoding considerations: there are no other encoding considerations for 'tn3270' URIs not described in RFC 3986 [RFC3986] Protocols that use the scheme: Telnet 3270 mode (TN3270) [RFC1041] and Telnet 3270 Enchanted Mode (TN3270E) ] 5.

Pistons vs MagicDetroit: Lawrence Frank | Tayshaun Prince | Greg Monroe
Miami: Erik Spoelstra | Chris Bosh | LeBron James
Pistons Head Coach Lawrence Frank
On the Heat: The speed they play at and the intensity is at such a high level, I think it is a great lesson for our guys. There’s a reason why they’re champs; they aren’t waiting for the regular season, they play hard every night. It goes way beyond having great players, they compete, and the speed off made baskets, layups, offensive rebounds and open shots. They compete at a very high level and we weren’t able to match it. They defend first, and have unbelievable pursuit of the ball, they share the ball, and are a good example of what a champion is. They had 36 fast break points by our count. They got it every which way and owned the paint.
On the Pistons:
I’m not into how one quarter is played. We expect more from our group. We weren’t able to make clean passes because they have their hands in the passing lane. We aren’t making passes on target. The game just shows you how much work we have to do.
Pistons Forward Tayshaun Prince
On the game: “It was disappointing. The only plus you can get out of this game is if you want to be where they’re at; look at how they played tonight. Those guys are going to come out like that all the time, and hopefully the young guys that we have can understand that if you want a chance to compete for a title, you need to play like that every night. We also didn’t make them take any tough shots. They just picked us apart. On the offensive end, they sped us up. Hopefully this is a learning experience for us. After this game, there are no easy days and you can’t take anything for granted. We’ll get better. We’ve been trying to figure things out in practice. Now we can we watch film to see things that we need to correct.”
Pistons Center Greg Monroe
On the game: “I know that we can play better as a whole. We have to do a better job of setting the tone. They played really well. We played really bad, and the score showed that. Our coach (Lawrence Frank) always talks about the game within the game. We tried to come out better after halftime.”
Heat Head Coach Erik Spoelstra
On the Game: “It is a good step forward. We just have to continue to build this training camp and get ready for the 30th.”
On Dwyane Wade: “From a conditioning standpoint I don’t think he is ready for a full 36 or 38 minute load right now but he is building up to that. We are encouraged but he will continue to be day-to-day and we will see how his leg is responding. He has been putting in a lot of work.”
On the rotation with Dwyane Wade, LeBron James and Chris Bosh:
“I wanted to give them minutes.”
On LeBron James:
“He can go more [minutes]. He has been terrific in practice. He had one of the better practices so far of training camp yesterday.”
Heat Forward Chris Bosh

St. Anne's School remembers Sister Germain
The sign outside St. Anne's School in Somerset honored one of its own.
The sign outside St. Anne's School in Somerset honored one of its own.
"Repos dans la paix de Dieu Sister Ella Marie." Which means, "Rest in the peace of God Sister Ella Marie Germain."
Sister Ella Marie Germain had voluntarily taught French to the first- through fifth-graders of St. Anne's School for three years. Although her ill health prevented her from continuing, the staff and students recalled fond memories of her after her death at age 96 on Oct. 29.
Donna Foley, fourth grade teacher, said that Sister Ella Marie's visits were greatly anticipated by her students.
"She was very patient and enjoyed the students as much as they enjoyed her," Foley said. "The students kept asking for a long time if she would come back and teach some more. They were also very excited when they'd see her at our Masses. She is greatly missed by all of us."
Sister Ella Marie was born on March 12, 1913. After graduating from New Richmond High School in 1932, she entered the convent of the Sisters of St. Joseph in Cookston, Minn. From there, she went to the Motherhouse in Bourg, France before beginning her 72-year teaching career.
After retiring in Somerset, she would visit St. Anne's School every Friday, bringing with her homemade picture cards. She taught them French prayers, phrases, greetings and even songs with movements.
"She would come in and say hello in French, and we would reply," Ali Paradies and Megan Erlitz, fourth-graders, recalled. "She'd ask us about the weather, and we would reply in French. She was nice; we liked the color cards and the songs we'd sing."
"It was good for her to come and volunteer, and she told good stories," said Luke Plourde, fifth-grader.
"I really liked how she put her life to teaching children and gave her life to God," Lauren Milbrandt, fifth-grader, concluded.Fourth Test

26/02/2010
Barcelona hosted the Mobile World Congress last week and offered a glimpse into some of the technology that could be enjoyed by consumers this year and beyond.
Fifty-five thousand people gathered to see what the year ahead holds for the mobile phone market and numerous manufacturers vied for consumers attention.
Vic Gundotra, vice-president of engineering for mobile at Google, suggested that it would be looking to implement all-new features it develops on mobile handsets.
"Comparing today's possibilities with what was possible 25 years ago and then thinking ahead 25 years from now, it's incredibly exciting to imagine what we might be able to do," he said.
Mobile recycling could be one option to consider for users wishing to get their hands on the latest devices.
Eric Schmidt told the congress that more than half of new web connections are coming from mobile devices, a rate that is eight times faster than the same point ten years ago for the desktop.

At the age of 14, John Bright has a history of truancy, while 12-year-old petty thief Richard Cardwall is described as “uncontrollable”.
But before you tut-tut at the out-of-control, undisciplined youth of today, you should know that these were young offenders of more than a century ago.
Victorian youth offenders, and their crimes – ranging from pigeon theft to financial fraud – are revealed online in the newly-digitised West Yorkshire Collection by family history resource Ancestry.co.uk.
The collection, spanning 1779 to 1914, contains more than 9,000 reformatory school records revealing criminal behaviour of children as young as five. It includes information on each crime, newspaper clippings and ‘mugshot’ photographs.
The collection can be accessed at West Yorkshire Archive Services – Bradford’s records are based in a refurbished area of the old Central Library – but this week, for the first time, thousands of 19th century child criminal records are published, shedding light on the delinquent and destitute children of Victorian Britain.
The collection details the crimes of boys admitted to Calder Farm Reformatory in Mirfield, East Moor Community Home School in Leeds and the Shadwell Children’s Centre in Leeds. Crimes range from gambling and petty criminality to forgery, burglary and violent assault.
Each entry lists the boy’s name, age, birth date and birthplace and selected records include physical descriptions and photographs, background information on their families and remarks on general attitude and behaviour. Release notes also detail how they fared up to three years after discharge from reformatory school.
Bradford child convicts include George Ackroyd, 13, of Manchester Road, who, in 1910, was given a five-year sentence for stealing a purse containing three shillings and twopence. His previous character is described as “bad”, having had a previous conviction of “malicious injury”, for which his parents were fined a shilling.
A pupil at St John’s School, Ashley Street, George was from a family of ten. His record states that his father deserted the family six years previously, and was thought to be with a troupe of “travelling actors”, and his mother worked as a weaver and was “addicted to drink”.
Thomas Anderson, 13, of Keighley, was given five years for stealing two shillings. Under previous character it says, “Up to 12 months ago good, then he has frequently stolen from his parents, then strayed away from home for a few days at a time”.
Twelve-year-old Herbert Wells, along with his friend William Jamieson, committed forgery and larceny after stealing an old chequebook from a local vet, faking his signature and drawing out significant funds. John Green was served a five-year sentence after “Trespassing on North Eastern Railway property”. The 14-year-old was caught “gambling with other boys in the station yard”.
John Bright, admitted, aged 14, for not attending school, is listed as “truant and untruthful”. His record includes a newspaper cutting reporting how he managed to escape from Shadwell but was caught, re-tried and returned.
Henry Sutton, 13, noted as having a “very violent temper” was admitted for “unlawful assault”. Despite his age, his records reveal that he already had “five indistinct tattoo marks on his left forearm”.
Listed as “uncontrollable”, Richard Cardwall, 12, was sent to East Moor Community Home School for four years after stealing a pigeon.
It wasn’t just offending that could land a boy at reform school. Aged just five, William Judge was sent to one after being found “wandering, not having any home or visible means of subsistence”..
But many were forced to serve a short time in prison as initial punishment before being transferred to a reformatory school to complete their sentence.
From a 21st century perspective, Victorian methods of punishment and discipline seem harsh and barbaric, especially since so many of these youngsters would have had troubled childhoods.
But it appears that the strict order and heavy-handed discipline of the reformatory schools helped many boys build better lives. Admitted to Calder Farm, aged 15, for stealing lead, orphan Sidney Taylor went on to became a staff sergeant in the Royal Horse Artillery and died in Belgium during the First World War.
Maurice Walch arrived at Calder Farm, aged 15, after a long history of petty theft and went on to become a lance corporal in the Military Mounted Police. He was awarded both the Victory and British Campaign medals.
Miriam Silverman, Ancestry.co.uk content manager, says: .”
Guilty Adults Also Spotlighted In Collection
The collection also contains details of nearly 400,000 adult convicts in West Yorkshire, with offences ranging from petty theft to cold-blooded murder. Each record contains the prisoner’s name, age, occupation, nature of offence, sentence, and dates of admission and discharge. Selected records also give background information and physical descriptions.
Convicts include Peter O’Hara, sentenced to two months in jail after assaulting a police officer. His record reveals that his hands were tattooed with the rather incongruous inking “my father’s love”.
Sarah Barlow, 49, sentenced to three years for stealing an umbrella, appeared to have had a penchant for clothing theft. Her 15 previous convictions include the theft of a shirt, two shawls, a pair of boots, a jacket and a hairbrush.
Richard Belch, 28, was found guilty of common assault after maliciously wounding Henry Sutton on May 25, 1902. His court records reveal he had five previous convictions for assault, gaming and drunken and disorderly behaviour The Backhouse brothers, Charles and Frederick, were charged with the wilful murder of policeman John Kew. Although Frederick received a reprieve and had his sentence changed to life imprisonment, Charles was hanged in the first double execution of the 20th century.Guide to the Gay Wilson Allen Papers, 1801-1988

Collection Overview Solitary Singer, a Whitman biography., The Solitary Singer. Allen used some of Furness's research materials to write the book. The Clara Barrus Papers Subseries contains her research materials on the relationship between Whitman and John Burroughs. In fact Barrus was a close friend of Whitman's friends Burroughs and Thomas Biggs Harned. The subseries includes portions of Barrus's correspondence, her research materials, and the manuscript of her study of Whitman and Burroughs, entitled Whitman and Burroughs, Comrades. The Correspondence Subseries contains correspondence with a number of Whitman friends, scholars, and collectors. The Writings Subseries chiefly reflects the results of the information Furness collected on Whitman during the 1930s and 1940s. Furness began three major Whitman projects: a definitive biography, an extensive bibliography, and a study of his reception in New England, tentatively entitled "The Bull in the China Shop." None of these works were published during Furness's lifetime.

Recovery continues in the local hotel market, fueled in part by several Downtown luxury hotels that have experienced healthy business in 2011 and anticipate an even stronger performance next year.
The lobby of the 110-room Madison Hotel is decorated in Christmas colors. The hotel completed major renovations of its guest rooms, lobby and restaurant this year.(Photo: Lance Murphey).
The numbers skew higher for the Downtown/Midtown submarket due to a higher percentage of luxury hotels. Average RevPAR year-to-date for Downtown/Midtown hotels has jumped $2.39 to $73.39, up from $71.10 in 2010. ADR has dipped less than 1 percent, from $126.25 in 2010 to $126.11 this year. The overall occupancy rate is 65.5 percent, up from 63.3 percent last year.
“Our business is up overall by roughly 6.5 percent over last year, and in 2010 we were up almost 11 percent over the previous year,” said Madison Hotel managing partner Mohammad Hakimian, who says his hotel’s higher-than-average 4 percent RevPAR increase is partially attributable to not discounting rates as much as its competition.
The 110-room Madison completed major renovations of its guest rooms, lobby and restaurant this year (total cost between $1 million and $1.5 million), so none are planned for 2012.
“We are budgeting to do more business next year for several reasons,” said Hakimian, who breaks his hotel’s clientele into 50 percent leisure travelers, 30 percent corporate and 20 percent groups. “The Convention and Visitors Bureau’s advanced bookings for next year are ahead of last year’s pace, so that bodes well for us.”
For the 464-room The Peabody hotel, business in 2011 overall has held steady, with occupancy rates even to last year, ADR up 2 percent and RevPAR up 2 percent.
“Corporate business has shown signs of improvement and group activity has picked up in Q3 and Q4,” said The Peabody director of marketing Craig Smith. “The NBA lockout has had some effect on activity Downtown and has impacted parking and outlet revenues. The relocation of Pinnacle Airlines has helped our outlet traffic. We are looking forward to the positive effect of the (Great) American Steamboat business starting in April of 2012.”
This year, The Peabody completed power washing, caulking and repair work to the exterior of the property, which should help to protect the building and create additional energy efficiencies. Capital improvements for 2012 will include the replacement of more than 880 windows as well as all guest room door and locks.
“Our projections for 2012 remain positive,” Smith said. “We are looking at a 3 percent to 4 percent increase overall with much of that being driven from the group market.”
The 203-room Westin Memphis Beale Street, across from FedExForum, and general manager Patrick Jordan are gearing up for the start of the Memphis Grizzlies’ season, which gets under way with an exhibition game Friday, Dec. 16.
“Overall it’s been a very good year for us,” said Jordan, who explained that they had to temper some expectations for this year due to the volatile economy and the delay to the start of the NBA season. “Being as close to the FedExForum as we are and doing as much business as we do with the NBA, obviously the NBA lockout had an impact. But we are excited about the teams coming to town, and the majority of them will be staying with us. It’s a great way to head into 2012.”
The Westin has benefited this year from a strong event schedule at FedExForum, as well as the hotel’s new on-site restaurant, bleu, which opened five weeks ago.
“On event nights at the Forum, bleu is guaranteed to be full or near capacity,” said Jordan. “And the bleu menu has been really well received by our in-room diners. It makes our in-room dining service different from anywhere else in town.”
Jordan expects 2012 to be a great year, and he points to the return of the Conference USA basketball tournament to FedExForum next spring as one of the many reasons.
Another of the Downtown market’s luxury offerings, the 230-room Crowne Plaza Memphis Downtown, is welcoming new management as the New Year approaches. General manager Steve Book took the reins at the hotel this past Monday.
“The business here at the Crowne Plaza was steady this year, and we expect a slight uptick for 2012,” said Book, who just arrived in town from Columbus, Ohio, where he managed a Holiday Inn.
Hotel consultant Chuck Pinkowski of Pinkowski & Co. forecast continued recovery for the Mid-South market next year.
“Overall, RevPAR for the Mid-South is up approximately 3 percent for 2011 and the forecast for next year is another 3 percent increase,” said Pinkowski. “And those figures should be higher for Downtown than the restNew subscription

Background: Font color:
Hermione sighed, turned over in bed and pulled the covers over her head. The bangs and crashes from down the stairs diminished slightly, however they still intruded. Growling she rolled over again intending to pull her pillows on top of her head, to fully block the noises, instead she felt herself falling and crashed to the floor. The noises from down stairs stopped immediately, shock telling in the deafening silence. Hermione smiled sleepily to herself and reached up with one hand pulling her pillows to the floor with her, within seconds she was asleep again.
Down the stairs two brilliant red heads were turned to each other in shock. No one was supposed to be home yet as the rest of the family were scheduled to be on holiday for another two weeks. When they had arrived early that morning a quick scan of the building had revealed no heart beats and no danger. The twins' faces turned grim and in unison they pointed their wands towards the stairs. Hearts beating at a maximum the jokers of the Weasely family turned very serious. They advanced without words, soft whispering steps avoiding creaking stairs with care born of experience. At the top they glanced at each other and proceeded in opposite directions, wands pointed ahead of them shield spells ready formed; needing just a trigger word; on the end of their tongues. Bodies held loose ready to duck and roll if need be their whispering steps showed their systematic passage down the twisting halls. Pausing by every door they thoroughly checked each room, as the progressed they were far enough apart to realise that they couldn’t go to each others aid nor expect any back up, used to working together this made the two young wizards nervous and more than ever on their guard.
Oblivious to the approach Hermione turned in her sleep, snuggled deeply beneath the covers only the very top of her head showing.
Fred reached the end of the corridor he had been following and reached a steady hand to the doorknob. His body positioned behind the frame, he slowly and silently turned the handle, willing the door to open without noise. Perspiration glistened on his forehead as the door swayed quietly open showing nothing but the pitch black of the room it led to. He took a steadying breath, pulling his hand back out of range as he did so. Fred repositioned himself, his eyes gradually adapting to the dark he could see, staying low he slipped into the room, pressing against the wall in a bid to make a small a target as possible. Wand pointed ahead of him but with his hand held close to his body he slowly worked his way around the room, taking slow, tiny sidesteps allowing his eyes to blur at the edges taking in the whole room, determinately not focusing on one object. He had learnt the hard way that to do so was to leave yourself open to attack. He reached the far wall and allowed himself to breath a little more freely, however didn’t relax his guard. His eyes now adjusted as well as human eyes could to the darkness he was submerged in, the nothingness no longer suffocating him, his wide gaze took in a small bench and a crumpled pile next to it. He glowered at his mistake. This had been hidden behind the door, if it had been dangerous he would have been dead. Dropping to a crouch he continued to sidestep round the room, careful not to become so focused on the huddle before him that he forget the rest of the room. His heart rate dropped and breathing slowed as he slipped into well-worn patterns of movement, his body remembering even when his mind was running through different scenarios, different reasoning, and different outcomes. He paused several feet from the pile lying on the floor, just out of grabbing range if he would take someone by surprise. Deciding he could risk some faint light, Fred allowed the trigger word to slip past his lips feeling the defensive structure he had created slip over him, as this settled he waved his hand and a gently glowing orb of light floated just above it.
Hermione froze, tiny sounds filtering through her sleeping state. Training kicked in and she had her wand in hand full awake in seconds, slitting her eyes she feigned sleep and rolled on her side. The soft glow of light reassured her, but only minutely, those of evil constitution thought it a waste of time to learn that spell but it wasn’t unheard of. The bleed of colours in the room slowly formed into images. There was a person crouched defensively out of arms reach, his wand loosely held in a steady hand, a flicker of pearlescance moving occasionally over his body. Hermione was not deceived by his relaxed hand or submissive defensive position. This was a man on edge, fully alert and experienced in these situations. She focused on his face, knowing a glimpse of his eyes would tell her of his intentions. They stared out of his face, a blank grey barely reaveling his pupils, no emotions showing and looking neither left or right. She searched her mind for a suitable swear word, and came up blank, as she did so snaps of information fused together in her overworked brain. She drew in a sharp breath as realisation slammed into her. “Fred?” She croaked in disbelief her voice hoarse from lack of use and dehydration. She swallowed feeling her bruised throat protest at the movement, “Fred Weasely? I was told you were dead.”

One more for SPENCER!
Forgot to mention when I was at the dealer the guy said that they are talking about bringing back the Triumph Trophy possibly for 2013. It will be shaft driven and would be made to compete with the Concourse, FJR, ST, etc.

SPENCER (This message for you)
Hey Spencer after reading your comment, I had to respond...
I was also bumbed when I first heard that the Sprint ST wasn't going to be offered in the US any longer; only Europe. Then I went to my local Triumph Dealership to compare the two bikes. I talked to the guy there that I bought my last bike from (Ninja ZX6-R). He was basically telling me the difference between the ST & the GT. At first I wasn't sure I liked the looks as much as the ST, because I LOVE the triple exhaust out the back. Anyway, he said with the GT, there's a few more horsepower added. The seat doesn't get warm, because the exhuast is now back on the side (I believe that's why they put it back there again). There's no brackets sticking out when you have the luggage off the bike. The luggage is now large enough to hold full faced helmets. On the ST the seat doesn't come off with a key; you have to unscrew it/unbolt it. The GT has a key like most bikes do to take the seat off. Also ABS is standard (if that's what you want). I know I do. I was reading an article about bike accidents and it was much lower, believe it or not, when the bike has ABS. He also said they changed the seat so it's more comfortable for the driver & rider. They made it a little wider and also redesigned it so the rider doesn't slide into you when braking so much. When I was looking at the ST's on Ebay, I found that when people wanted to change the exhuast to aftermarket. It then has 3 goofy looking circular holes coming out the back. I haven't seen one that looked as good as the factory pipes. At least with the GT, you can just bolt an aftermarket exhaust and it will still look awesome!
Also, think of it this way. If you keep looking on Ebay, there's still a few ST's sitting at the dealerships that haven't sold yet. So you'll be able to still buy one that is totally brand new, with a full warranty. One more thing... If you do want to trunk or topbox. You'll notice it looks a little better on a GT. On the ST, it looks really goofy I think. Like it sticks way up in the air and takes away from the looks of the bike. Not sure I'll get that for the GT or not. I'm thinking I'll just get a Corbin circular backrest. Those look nice on the sportbikes/sport touring bikes.
Hope this helped you out a little...
I've also been a Kawasaki fan and then when they started getting away from the graphics, I started looking at the Triumphs. I was going back and forth whether to buy a Concours14 or a Sprint ST/GT and I have to agree with you. The Concours is just a bit too big. The Sprint seems like it's the perfect size for sport riding!
Sincerely,
Steven
Spencer -No Sprint ST for the USA?!?!?!
June 14, 2010 04:09 PM
I am glad they are developing new bikes but they also decided to take the bike I was planning on buying in the near future off the US market. According to my local store no new Sprint ST for the USA, only the Sprint GT. I liked the idea of the Sprint ST better, a tad more sporty and yet able to tacke touring as well. While I will probably consider the GT I also guess I will have to look back into the FJR, which was a bit bigger than I want and more money. BMW isnt an option, too expensive, and the Concorse is too big luxo looking for me.

I'm still waiting for a new tiger with a little more serious off road intentions. Stroke a 675 engine and add the necessary water proofing ect and a big gas tank and long travel suspension factory bags gps mount dirty fuel circut and they could have a serious contender .

A Tiger 675 could be a fun toy alongside the Tiger 1050. A little lighter, a little narrower, and a little more opportunity to have a heavy right wrist before the fun police come knocking.
I'd hit it.

Steve -more motor options ?
April 28, 2010 08:19 AM
I'd love to have the option of having a 360deg firing order on the Thunderbird 1700. As I understand it this would only require a 360deg crank and new computer tune mapping and would give about 10%-15% more HP (based on the difference between the Bonneville & America). I do not want mine to sound like a Harley - I would much rather have ~ 120HP & 115lb-ft. This would make a great platform for a bagger and fairing equipped tourer for those who are so inclined (e.g. American market). My preference would be a sport-tourer on this platform. It would also be interesting to see a standard based on the parallel triple; something akin to the Trident.
Superlight -WSBK Rules
April 22, 2010 05:11 PM
Dano, you just don't get it, do you? If a twin (or triple) is to race against 4-cylinder bikes, the displacements must be enlarged to even up the power production. Why? because a twin will not rev as high as a triple which will not rev as high as a four and RPMs = HP. Ducati is not a "crybaby" as you suggest - they just understand the laws of physics as applied to engines.
VinceXB -SBK... PLEASE!
April 12, 2010 09:48 AM
Come on, Triumph! Give us a 1000cc superbike! Give us something to root for in WSBK and AMA SBK! Take a shot at knocking off the Japanese metrics and Ducati. That's what we're all really waiting for.
Dano -1100 triples
April 10, 2010 05:14 AM
even if they make a 1100cc triple, they could not race it in world superbike, as the homologation for triples in WSB is still only 1000cc for triples, unless your DUCATI and you cry like a little baby saying you wont race unless they can raise the cc limit on their twins, at which point they will raise it, Triumph having not been in it, does not have any leverage, It would seem clear that they would get the extra 100cc advantage over the I4's but apparently WSB officials do not see it that way?
triumph -upgrades
March 28, 2010 05:10 PM
one thing that people either don't know or forget is that the twins are choked to death from the factory. it doesn't take much to make one of these little twins lay waste to hd's that are twice the displacement and cost twice as much. then you can feed into that whole triumph vs. harley thing...lol..

I have over a 120,000 miles on my 99 trophy and would love to see a new one. The Spirt ST is to much sport. Are you planning on a new Trophy any time soon? I like what you have done to the new Thruxton but it is the same mods I did to my 04 in 05. What took so long? I bought the bonny top top clamp and added drag bars years before you thought of it. I like most of what I see. But the old T-birds were better.

As a past Speed Triple owner I can attest to the sweet sound and performance a "trumpet" can posses. The new models are well thought out tweaks of existing models (Triumph actually listens to its customers' feedback). That said, the biggest complaint buyers have is the continual increase in purchase prices. It's no wonder C-list and E*#Y are selling used bikes on their sites on a regular basis. As much as I'd like a new trumpet, extending a payment plan to bring the monthly cost down and paying over a longer time just isn't worth the higher costs and bike depreciation! My 650L is safe for now....

Motorcycle USAMadonna Says “There Will Be No Wardrobe Malfunctions” During Her Half-Time Performance
Will Sunday’s Half-Time show be a repeat of Justin Timberlake and Janet Jackson? Madonna says, NO!
She says,
“There will be no wardrobe malfunctions. I promise. [It'll be] a spectacular show, for all age groups, and it will be a feast for the ears and eyes.”
Madonna will sing three old songs and one new one. She didn’t elaborate; because she doesn’t want to “blow the surprise.” The new one is surely her single “Give Me All Your Luvin’”.
Madonna has also been added to the injured list! She pulled a hamstring while rehearsing for the show, and also suffered a cut on her nose.
“I feel like one of the players. But I’m all right. You have to be ready for your game so I rehearse, rehearse, rehearse so I’m ready for anything.”
During the same press conference, Madonna showed off some moves we can almost expect to see Sunday too! Salsa dancing in honor of New York Giants wide receiver Victor Cruz. Looks like someone does Zumba!

Johannesburg - South Africa's rand was largely unchanged against the US dollar on Tuesday, recovering after four sessions of losses but still unable to shake off negative economic sentiment following a banking downgrade this week.
By 08:49 SA time, the local unit had firmed slightly to 10.7300 per dollar after earlier touching its softest level against the greenback since August 8 this year.
The currency came under pressure in the previous session from a rampant US dollar, which reached 11-month highs after the Federal Reserve's signalled an earlier-than-expected interest rate hike.
Rate hikes and tighter fiscal policy in the world's largest economy look set to diminish large capital in-flows into emerging market economies like South Africa.
Currency trader Warrick Butler of Standard Bank urged clients to cash-in on rand weakness and dollar strength.
“If you have been long on the US dollar, the smart play would be to take some off it should we get an early morning panic-spike into the high 10.70s.”Funky Groovy T-Shirts

Screen: Lots of Chocolates for Miss Eliza Doolittle:'My Fair Lady' Bows at the Criterion play the title role that Julie Andrews so charmingly and popularly originated on the stage.
All things considered, it is the brilliance of Miss Hepburn as the Cockney waif who is transformed by Prof. Henry Higgins into an elegant female facade that gives an extra touch of subtle magic and individuality to the film, which had a bejeweled and bangled premiere at the Criterion last night.
Other elements and values that are captured so exquisitely in this film are but artful elaborations and intensifications of the stage material as achieved by the special virtuosities and unique flexibilities of the screen.
There are the basic libretto and music of Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe, which were inspired by the wit and wisdom in the dramatic comedy, "Pygmalion," of George Bernard Shaw. With Mr. Lerner serving as the screen playwright, the structure and, indeed, the very words of the musical play as it was performed on Broadway for six and a half years are preserved. And every piece of music of the original score is used.
There is punctilious duplication of the motifs and patterns of the décor and the Edwardian costumes and scenery, which Cecil Beaton designed for the stage. The only difference is that they're expanded. For instance, the Covent Garden set becomes a stunningly populated market, full of characters and movement in the film; and the embassy ball, to which the heroine is transported Cin-derellalike, becomes a dazzling array of regal splendor, as far as the eye can reach, when laid out for ritualistic emphasis on the Super-Panavision color screen. Since Mr. Beaton's decor was fresh and flawless, it is super-fresh and flawless in the film.
In the role of Professor Higgins, Rex Harrison still displays the egregious egotism and ferocity that he so vividly displayed on the stage, and Stanley Holloway still comes through like thunder as Eliza's antisocial dustman dad.
Yes, it's all here, the essence of the stage show—the pungent humor and satiric wit of the conception of a linguistic expert making a lady of a guttersnipe by teaching her manners and how to speak, the pomp and mellow grace of a romantic and gone-forever age, the delightful intoxication of music that sings in one's ears.
The added something is what Miss Hepburn brings—and what George Cukor as the director has been able to distill from the script.
For want of the scales of a jeweler, let's just say that what Miss Hepburn brings is a fine sensitivity of feeling and a phenomenal histrionic skill. Her Covent Garden flower girl is not just a doxy of the streets. She's a terrifying example of the elemental self-assertion of the female sex. When they try to plunge her into a bathtub, as they do in an added scene, which is a wonderfully comical creation of montage and pantomime, she fights with the fury of a tigress. She is not one to submit to the still obscure customs and refinements of a society that is alien to her.
But when she reaches the point where she can parrot the correct words to describe the rain in Spain, she acknowledges the thrill of achieving this bleak refinement with an electrical gleam in her eyes. And when she celebrates the male approval she receives for accomplishing this goal, she gives a delightful demonstration of ecstasy and energy by racing about the Higgins mansion to the music of "I Could Have Danced All Night."
It is true that Marni Nixon provides the lyric voice that seems to emerge from Miss Hepburn, but it is an excellent voice, expertly synchronized. And everything Miss Hepburn mimes to it is in sensitive tune with the melodies and words.
Miss Hepburn is most expressive in the beautiful scenes where she achieves the manners and speech of a lady, yet fails to achieve that one thing she needs for a sense of belonging—that is, the recognition of the man she loves.
She is dazzlingly beautiful and comic in the crisply satiric Ascot scene played almost precisely as it was on the stage. She is stiffly serene and distant at the embassy ball and almost unbearably poignant in the later scenes when she hungers for love. Mr. Cukor has maneuvered Miss Hepburn and Mr. Harrison so deftly in these scenes that she has one perpetually alternating between chuckling laughter and dabbing the moisture from one's eyes.
This is his singular triumph. He has packed such emotion into this film—such an essence of feeling and compassion for a girl in an all too-human bind—that he has made this rendition of "My Fair Lady" the most eloquent and moving that has yet been done.
There are other delightful triumphs in it. Mr. Harrison's Higgins is great—much sharper, more spirited and eventually more winning than I recall it on the stage. Mr. Holloway's dustman is titanic, and when he roars through his sardonic paean to middle-class morality in "Get Me to the Church on Time," he and his bevy of boozers reach a high point of the film.
Wilfrid Hyde White as Colonel Pickering, who is Higgins's urbane associate; Mona Washburn as the Higgins housekeeper, Gladys Cooper as Higgins's svelte mama and, indeed, everyone in the large cast is in true and impeccable form.
Though it runs for three hours — or close to it — this "My Fair Lady" seems to fly past like a breeze. Like Eliza's disposition to dancing, it could go on, for all I'd care, all night.

By Dustin Rowles | Trade News | July 6, 2010 | Comments ()
It's a slow part of the summer, and we're coming off of a long holiday weekend, which is why I'm reduced -- at the moment -- to reporting on another couple of offer stories, which are notoriously iffy. It's not that the offers aren't legit, it's that whether the offerees accept is very much an unknown. The conversion rate, so to speak, is unpredictable. But then again, The Cog has tipped us to several offers in the past that have come to fruition, including Ryan Reynolds in R.I.P.D., Robert Downey, Jr. in Oz: The Great and Powerful, and a month ago, we were told that the Lego movie had been offered to Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs' Phil Lord and Chris Miller, and had it been a slow news cycle, we'd have run that then, too. The flip-side, unfortunately, is that nothing has come of the offer to Megan Fox in Red Sonja that we reported a couple of months ago, though I'm told the offer is still on the table -- despite the denial from Megan Fox's rep -- and that she's still awaiting a script before she makes a decision. Given the direction her career has taken of late, she'd best hop on that money while she still can.
All of which is to say: Don't get your hopes up, or begin your despair, such as it is, until someone has signed on the dotted line.
However, the first offer story does have a happy inverse implication: We reported quite some time ago that Anna Faris and Ryan Reynolds were attached to an inhumanely awful sounding rom-com called TMI, which was a cool title in 2002. The movie -- from writers Marc Klein (The Good Year) and Kristen Smith (The House Bunny) -- is about two "just friends" types who finally realize they're made for each other after a drug-induced evening of debauchery. It's being described as a cross between ALONG CAME POLLY and KEEPING THE FAITH (eeesh). Faris is still attached to the movie, but the sort of good news is that an offer is now out to Bradley Cooper, which is not good for Cooper, but it would suggest that Ryan Reynolds is no longer on board, although he's still attached in a producer capacity. It makes sense, given how many projects Reynolds is currently juggling, including The Green Lantern, Deadpool, and the already announced The Green Lantern 2. It could also be that Reynolds is more heavily considering Incurable, a movie he's been attached to for some time, but that hasn't yet found a director. It's an intriguing concept -- from a Will Strouse script -- about a group of people who suffer from various bizarre metaphysical maladies, including one person no one can remember from one meeting to the next; another who has lived for centuries and can never die, and a female sexual predator whose victims disappear forever after she seduces them. As they try to help one another get better, they each realize that their respective cures carry a very high price.
Cooper, it would seem, would be unlikely to take it, as he's just bailed on a Shyamalan film reportedly because it conflicted with the shooting schedule for The Hangover 2, which is a dumb excuse because The Hangover 2 is gearing up for production while the Shyamalan project is still in the pitch stage. My guess is that Cooper saw The Last Airbender and bailed, as he's being very particular in the wake of the soft box-office of The A-Team. He's thus likely to make very conservative choices, and I'm not sure TMI would fall under that category, though it is rated R and Cooper did find his biggest success with the R-Rated The Hangover. TMI hasn't found a director yet, so that may be an eventual factor. It is worth noting, however, that after The Hangover 2, Cooper has nothing on his plate past the pitch stage, including the very bad sounding baseball project he's attached to with the hacktacular Alan Loeb scripting.
Elsewhere, in other offer news, Jim Carrey -- whose career has been shoddy, at best, in recent years -- has been offered a part in Burt Wonderstone, from writer John Francis Daley (he of "Freaks and Geeks" fame) and Jonathon Goldstein, who has the hot title Horrible Bosses in production. Burt Wonderstone is about a magician who loses everything after his ego and his refusal to do new tricks leads his partner to leave him and his show is cancelled. Burt's childhood idol eventually reminds Burt what magic is all about, and Burt has to convince his partner to return so they can pull off that one magic trick that has eluded him.
The other interesting note about Burt Wonderstone, aside from the offer to Carrey, is that Sacha Baron Cohen is reportedly "interested" in the project, too. I'm not told whether Baron is interested in the same part that Carrey is offered, or whether he's interested in the partner role.
In either respect, New Line is still searching for a director but hopes to begin filming of the movie in January. While Carrey is in talks to star in Mr. Popper's Penguin, he's got nothing else ramped up for production on his plate, while Sacha Baron Cohen has seemingly been circling half a dozen projects for the last six months, although he is currently filming Martin Scorsese's Hugo Cabret.

There is a large academic debate over judicial philosophy, with some supporting the theory that justices can be categorized as judicial conservatives, moderates, or liberals based upon their interpretation of the United States Constitution, while others argue that justices cannot be evaluated using such a rigid division. Still, when nominations to important courts are made, a key issue is judicial philosophy. Beyond judicial and constitutional theory, many justices or judges may at times vote in line with either the popular "conservative" or "liberal" positions of the day. This can earn them a conservative or liberal label based on how often they align themselves with particular political positions, independent of their philosophical or theoretical views on the Constitution and/or the role of judges in general. As an example of how labels can be somewhat confusing when applied in reference to a judge, Erik Jaffe, a former clerk to Justice Clarence Thomas has pointed out that the term "conservative" is frequently misunderstood in public debate:
The conservative judicial philosophy is marked by the belief that judges should not make policy decisions properly left by the text of the U.S. Constitution to the executive and legislative branches of government. Many judicial conservatives adhere to the idea of originalism, a method of legal interpretation which states that the original intent and/or meaning of the Constitution was fixed by the Founding Fathers of the United States and cannot be changed except by the amendment process. They believe that, through the process of judicial review, certain legal rights or restrictions have been taken by modern judges far beyond what was intended by the Founding Fathers. Many judicial conservatives also believe that foreign law and precedent should not be a factor in U.S. legal matters.[2]
Politically, a conservative judicial philosophy can in addition be associated with Conservatism, a defense of established values. As a result, many judicial conservatives believe that traditional moral values are important in legal interpretation, and therefore tend to be pro-life and more lenient with matters concerning the separation of church and state. Judicial conservatives are almost always nominated by Republicans.
Prominent Judicial Conservatives on the Supreme Court include:
Prominent Judicial Conservatives on the Courts of Appeals include:
The liberal judicial philosophy is marked by the belief that the U.S. Constitution is a living document which through the process of judicial review is open to new evaluation and modernization, that foreign law and precedent should be a factor in U.S. legal matters, and that certain rights or restrictions should be expanded. Politically, a liberal judicial philosophy can be associated with Progressivism, a desire for social reform. Due to their general support for strong protection of individual liberties, judicial liberals tend to be pro-choice and more restrictive in matters concerning the separation of church and state. Although certain Republican nominated justices have turned out to be judicial liberals, judicial liberals are generally nominated by Democrats.
Prominent Judicial Liberals on the Supreme Court include:
Prominent Judicial Liberals on the Court of Appeals include:
A moderate judicial philosophy is not as easily defined as judicially conservative and liberal philosophies are. It is usually composed of a balance between particular conservative and liberal beliefs. Frequently, judicial moderates are pegged as such because they will vote in a conservative manner on some issues, but vote in a liberal manner on others. This can make a judicial moderate the swing vote in certain cases depending on which legal issue is being decided. On the other hand, some judicial moderates are pegged as such simply because they will reverse their own prior decisions.
On the appellate level, some jurists are known as judicial moderates because they concentrate on evaluating the law based on wording and past legal precedent (stare decisis) rather than upon a consideration of outside factors such as religious beliefs or public opinion. Supreme Court justices, however, are less likely to be defined as moderates for the same reason because there is not the same mandate for them to follow stare decisis. As members of the highest court in the land, they can vote to overturn legal precedents and do not have to follow stare decisis if they find such action warranted.
In the case of judicial nominees with no prior judicial experience, some are called moderates because they lack a distinctive past with which to evaluate their future performance as jurists.

In the past, few companies had international teams to develop effective strategies, create standards and employ consistent work processes across all property types and all business units.
Organizations with locations worldwide would often have corporate real estate resources available but, more often would rely on the foreign business units themselves to negotiate and coordinate CRE decisions. Very often professionals given the authority to make decisions were sales directors, logistics managers, human resource coordinators or the business leaders themselves.
Many of these professionals did not possess the requisite real estate expertise as they already had a full-time role on which their career advancements would be judged so real estate and facilities was not given the priority it deserved. Sometimes the tactical decisions were made without strategy and proved inefficient at best, costly at worst.
Expanding manufacturing companies entering new markets and navigating transitional economies often had to evaluate joint ventures, consortiums or establish their own facilities. Securing office space and lease vs. buy decisions were driven by cost, flexibility and corporate policy.
Some of the inherent challenges include:
- unpredictable time for permitting and approvals – different countries have differing levels of approval processes
- bureaucratic inconsistencies – difficult to identify officials responsible in administering laws governing the operation and ownership of facilities
- government/legal uncertainty – interpretation and inconsistency of laws/legislation and lack of coordination between authorities
- animosity toward foreign investment – varying levels of acceptance of civil servants to welcome foreign companies to operate within their country
- unsatisfactory transportation and telecommunications infrastructure – critical to the success of getting materials to/from market and transferring data are acceptable modes of transport, internet and telephony
- differences with property rights and real estate law – privatization of land, reform and ownership present unique challenges that require substantial internal/external counsel to determine rights and privileges
Today, managing global portfolios is made easier based on several factors:
Sarbanes-Oxley Compliance – With the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in 2002, US-based public corporations and the companies that support them are now held to a higher standard of accountability. Compliance requires that automated or manual CRE procedures must be documented and consistently repeatable across multiple business units to reduce the number of different business processes being monitored. An information system provide a secure environment to document every transaction and process producing more reliable information and improves the accuracy of the audit trail.
Information Systems – Enterprise-wide information systems help CRE professionals become more productive and knowledge-based decision support more effective. Systems can manage transaction risks, facilitate work requests and perform property services due to more complete and accurate information. A team of professionals located in one country with counterparts located around the globe can utilize a common information platform enabling enterprises to operate more efficiently, responsively and profitably. Systems enable roll up reporting to aggregate occupancy cost information, calculate future rent obligations and manage environmental sustainability initiatives.
Use of Outsourced Professionals – The emergence of truly international service providers allow global companies to align with real estate service providers who can provide brokerage, tenant representation, and construction/project management to develop and execute strategy and establish global management agreements. While compensation models pose another set of challenges, the benefits of accessing a global network with local market knowledge are irreplaceable.
The good news is that the ability to overcome challenges to managing large, complex portfolios are made much easier with a combination of compliance, technology and people.

By: Corey Dade Posted: May 17 2013 6:36 PM 0 Former Acting Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service Steven T. Miller (Alex Wong/Getty) (The Root) -- For the Obama administration's critics, Steven T. Miller, the ousted chief of the Internal Revenue Service, might now serve as the face of the overreaching, politically intimidating and criminal behavior of big government under this president. That message is filtering from Republicans amid Miller's testimony before the House Ways and Means Committee Friday morning, in the first of several planned congressional hearings on the IRS's targeted scrutiny of conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status. Miller has become the fall guy in a growing scandal that has prompted an FBI investigation, a pledge by President Obama to enact reforms and accusations by conservative groups that the Obama administration used the IRS to punish political adversaries. Several Republican lawmakers say that Miller did not tell them about the screening practices last year, despite their repeated inquires. The screening, which occurred between 2010 and 2012, singled out organizations with "tea party," "patriots" or other phrases in their names. The IRS has acknowledged that Miller learned about the targeting in the spring of 2012. But in subsequent exchanges with Republican senators, Miller did not disclose the practice. Any false statements would be investigated as potential crimes, Attorney General Eric Holder told lawmakers on Wednesday. "False-statement violations might have been made, given at least what I know at this point," he said. Obama fired Miller after an inspector general's audit (pdf) released on Tuesday found that IRS employees used "inappropriate criteria" as a shortcut in evaluating political-advocacy groups that applied for a 501(c)(4) tax exemption. For Republicans, this is the juiciest red meat. They have condemned the targeting policy as criminal. In addition, they want to determine if members of the Obama administration knew about and concealed the IRS's activities during the 2012 elections. The inference, even if proved untrue, makes for good fodder in anti-Obama talking points that will be used to excite the conservative base for the 2014 midterm elections. As Republican strategist Todd Harris, an adviser to Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, told the Washington Post, "This will be the gift that keeps on giving. There won't be a GOP campaign in the country that doesn't use this to raise money." Obama said on Thursday that he didn't know about the targeting until it was revealed in news reports. "Americans have a right to be angry about it, and I'm angry about it," Obama told reporters. "It should not matter what political stripe you're from. The fact of the matter is, the IRS has to operate with absolute integrity." Setting aside the furor for a moment, here's a reality check: * The audit blamed poor management, not partisan politics, for the "inappropriate" focus on conservative groups. * None of the conservative organizations pulled for special review has been disqualified. * The IRS has a long history of politically motivated tax enforcement at the orders of past presidents and the FBI. * The IRS has reason to be skeptical. The Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United ruling cleared the way for new organizations to obtain the 501(c)(4) (pdf) tax exemption, which requires them to be "primarily engaged" in promoting social welfare. Instead, many flout the law as purely political groups.The.

Krieger’s comments about the .01% make sense, but Zell’s comment that the 1% work harder is something that should be comprehended by many of the 99%, even though they probably wouldn’t believe it. Those of my clientele who are in the top 1% of income (not the .01%) do tend to work frighteningly hard. Even more than working hard, they work smart, and they’re always thinking – which I find exhausting. I’m talking about corporate execs who get up at 5AM and start every day with a five mile run before working a 12 hour day. Their whole lives are divided into 15 minute blocks, synchronized via smart phone with their spouse. Even their weekends and vacations are crammed full of activities, challenges, etc. I have a brother who’s climbed to the top of one of the big four accounting firms. My wife says “he’s lucky”. Luck has nothing to do with it. This is someone who lined up snow shoveling contracts every fall starting at age ten, held multiple paper routes from age 12, was valedictorian, summa cum laude, MBA, etc etc. I don’t feel sorry for 1%ers, but a lot of regular people don’t have any idea how hard they work – and it usually starts when they’re very young.

When people write LOL, they aren’t usually laughing out loud. I literally laughed out loud at Econman. It’s reminds me of the old saying “it’s funny how people who work really hard are really lucky”. The 1% are often people who own plumbing businesses or insurance agencies or consulting firms. They usually work long hours. A week or two ago a couple of guys came through my neighborhood about 7:30 AM on trash removal/recycling day. They were salvaging copper and other metals from old appliances that my neighbor had left out to be hauled away. It was -10F (before wind chill) and I started talking to them, wondering how they could be working with bare hands. They seemed like decent guys. One said he was 52 and had been doing it “for 35 years”. He said “I didn’t go to school, so I started scrapping”. He said he liked it. It seemed like honest work to me, and that’s what matters most. Those guys were working hard doing tough work, but they also admitted they fell into that line of work because they hadn’t learned to do anything else. I’m not putting them down. I’m holding them up. I realize that there are a lot of people doing hard work. I’m not saying that only the top1% work that hard, but the top 1% of income earners usually started working hard and smart from an earlier age.

Sam Zell….
Born Samuel Zielonka in Chicago in 1941 to Polish Joo Immigrant parents….
Hmmm…. “work harder”? Not so sure about that…
Zell was heavy into real estate when Blackstone bought them out for 39 Billion in 2007. Blackstone was formed by, amongst others, some guy named Schwarzman who used to work for Lehman Brothers, Kuhn, Loeb Inc… LOTS of “tribe” names there, donchathink?
So anyways, Blackstone buys out Zell in 07 for 39 Billion, then turns around and sells off the properties at huge profits. Of course by early 09, less than two years later, most of the properties sold were “under water” and worth less than their mortgages..
So… Joos who used to work for other Joos bought out yet another Joo, sold that property to stupid Goy at overinflated prices… and all the Joos made shattering amounts of money EXCEPT the stupid Goy who ended up “under water”….
Works harder? Meh… the more I read about this Zell piece of shit and his dealings, the more I fucking hate him…

Fuck yes those folks work harder. Anyone who thinks not is a fucking idiot. And not only do they work hard now, they worked hard getting their education and experience.
And by harder I mean longer hours.
How anyone could even seriously debate this is beyond me.
And my understanding of Zell, no matter what else he may be, is he is and has always been a hard worker, working virtually every waking moment.
Iska – sorry to be late to the party.
Man, this place is not what it used to be. Class warfare seems to be the name of the game. People do not even know what or who the one per cent are. They concentrate on it being Zell. It is not him, and he was right about the one percent working harder.

Bruce says:
I’m not sure exactly how much wealth or income it takes to be counted in the 1%er club. I took in tons of swag from mid 70’s thru the 80’s when swag was really worth some swag. Because of this got to meet quite a few folks that I’m sure adjusted for inflation far exceeded the minimum requirements what ever they are. During this period I met among others many bankers and securities dealers. I dealt with these wicked rich bastards almost every day. They were most useful in that they had pre-pillaged and plundered the sheeple, investors and such and then piled it up all in one place. So it was relatively easy to conduct legal but what otherwise amounted to raids of piracy against them. This was in a way a kind of creepy time in my life but I thoroughly enjoyed my walk of debauchery and profit thru the dark side while packing deals up rich fuckers assholes. Through my associations with these successful people (at least financially successful) I have observed this………………..
Do they work hard? Some do, some don’t. Some of them are always on the damn golf course or getting a blow job when you try to find them. Are they real smart? Some are very smart, very sharp and very talented but many are morons. However as a sub set of humans they contain a much lower percentage of morons than the general public, but many can become temporary morons when you hand them a pen and let them draw their very own greed button. Are they trustworthy and virtuous? Only to the extent that their behavior is predictable. Are some of them fun or crazy? Hell yes. Do they make good friends? No. Best they remain disposable associations or you will become disappointed. So for the most part they are like everyone else except with more stuff and more power. This is why they often do stupid shit just like most people. Makes you wonder how they managed to earn all their money in the first place, how they managed to keep some of it and get more all the time. Now I’ll tell you how……………………….
Three things I see in common with most all of them, and they are critical attributes……one they find and can motivate lots of other people who are workaholics or can be driven do all the real work. These people who do all the work are just as greedy but don’t think as big and on occasion need to be whipped. At the management level or even the executive level these are also the people who do the deceiving, bullshitting and finagling. That way if things go south on a deal they are the ones who get nailed to the wall.
Two……………since it’s better to pretty much do what ever the fuck you want then be regulated and better to get paid than pay tax they all had fantastic accountants and attorneys who specialized in their industries and making all kinds of things go away. These accountants, attorneys and their firms were not connected with the political and bureaucratic authorities in any improper way…….wink,wink,nudge, nudge. Those unrecorded payments, awesome deals on cars, houses, hookers, vacations and other such things have nothing to do with anything.
And three………..they take great risks with money. But only with other peoples money and not before commissions, fees, expenses and lots of other necessary costs or they have other people pay for everything plus a lot more and then bill for cost overruns like those big time in the trades.
A general can be industrious and brilliant or slothful and foolish but he can do nothing with out a a staff , an army and having his solders take the ultimate risk.
For those who are religious, rest assured that these fuckers will almost to a man burn in hell. Got a 1%er who is a totally immoral wild bastard. He ‘s going to burn in hell. Got a 1%er that goes to church every week and contributes to charity. Don’t let him fool you. He’s gonna burn in hell. Harbor hatred for these people …………… …well save a little of it for when you look in there mirror.
The difference between them and most all of us is the amounts of money and how much gets done with it. My one concern since I’m repentant for almost nothing is that when it’s my time I may get stuck in with a whole pack of these fuckers and their minions while being set on fire. But then that’s still a lot better than being set on fire in a place full of sheeple.

If you read my comments and the story by Krieger, it isn’t about the 1%. You are right. The most productive, hard working people in the country are a major portion of the 1%.
The story is about Zell and the rest of the .01% who have used the Wall Street gambling casino and the easy money provided by the Fed to ruin the country, gutting all the productive assets.
I remember when people weren’t so thin skinned on TBP and didn’t leave the site like pussies and 3rd grade girls like ecliptix and AWD.

Bruce, thanks for the insight and interesting read. Basically, the majority of over-achievers cheat the system. I don’t think like a criminal, so while it’s easy to understand, it’s harder to put oneself in their shoes.
I was with you up until your last point, no one other than the devil and his anti-christ are going to burn in hell forever. Let me explain. Man was created with body, soul, and spirit. Adam transgressed God’s commandment and lost his spiritual connection with God. After the sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who gave up his life, it’s possible to be born again and receive holy spirit. Spirit is eternal life.
People who never accept Jesus Christ as Lord, and believe God raised him from the dead will go through life without receiving holy spirit and in the resurrection will be thrown into the lake of fire.
“This is the second death, the lake of fire. And if anyone’s name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.” (Revelation 20:14b-15, ESV).
“For in death there is no remembrance of you; in Sheol who will give you praise?” (Psalm 6:5, ESV)
When you die, you’re dead, until the resurrection, and if you’re thrown into the lake of fire, you are no more, you perish. The difficulty with the devil and the beast, the anti-christ, is they are spirit, and as such they cannot be killed, therefore, when they are thrown into the lake of fire they do not perish.
, ESV)
“and the devil who had deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur where the beast and the false prophet were, and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.” (Revelation 20:10, ESV)
Here’s a link I found which discusses it further,

For historical perspective, back in 1986, the top 1% of earners reported 11% of all income and paid 26% of the income taxes; the lower-earning 50% made 17% of the income and paid 6% of the nation’s individual income tax bill.

How hard do you have to work to make $400k per year? 60 hours a week? 100? Or maybe even hardly at all? A wise man once said …….. “it’s not about working hard, it’s about working smart”.
One way to work smart is to get other people to make your money.
I worked very very hard as a mortgage broker. And if you think that’s dumb or funny … you just don’t understand what the job entails. I made OK, even good money. A “slacker” week was 60 hours …. 70-80 hours was more normal. But the floor manager? He worked 40-60 EASY hours … never leaving the office …. and made around a million per year.

I firmly believe that what many perceive as “class warfare” is not due to their actual wealth, but rather these Big 3;
—– 1) the 1% earned their wealth in an unsavory manner
—– 2) the 1% use their wealth to hold others down
—– 3) the 1% use their wealth to circumvent Laws the rest of us must follow

If I’ve said it once, I’ve said it a million times, its not the one percent that controls the fate of the government. That belongs to a handful of billionaires so far up the food chain that a percentage doesn’t describe them.
Although the term oligarch does, I much prefer that.
1% cuts off at something like $350k, and I personally know many people that make that much dough. They are business owners, doctors and engineers. Patent holders, writers and producers.
The one percent certainly do drive the economy. Without them we have almost no jobs.
The problem is that we have a bought and paid for congress, and the people doing the buying are mega-conglomerates and oligarchs. Its these jacklegs that are running and ruining the show.
Targeting the 1% wholesale is just as ridiculously divisive as targeting the boomers or blacks exclusively. Division is the enemy of the people, and thats why our owners (mega-corp/oligarchs) have encouraged it at every turn.

I trust you know I was just having fun with ya.
Regarding my supposed “vow” ………….. I DON’T do vows!! And here’s why;
“So the servant put his hand under the thigh of his master Abraham and swore an oath to him concerning this matter.” ——— Genesis 24:9
Understand this, please — “under the thigh” is a EUPEMISM. There ain’t no Hebrews touching each other’s thighs. God don’t care about no stinkin thighs. It is a euphemism for “penis”. Plus, translators don’t use anatomically correct terms for sexual organs. So then, what is under the penis? Testicles!! So, a Biblical vow requires grabbing testicles …. and Stucky is, and always will be, familiar with only his own nuts.
This is 100% true. Today it is common to “swear by one’s word”. Well, that was the Hebrew way of doing the same. Only it was a more forceful method because they were “swearing by one’s seed or lineage” that the vow would be carried out. (Seed and lineage are EXTREMELY important concepts in the O.T., and New.)
And it is from this concept … the importance of TESTICLES … from which we derive our English words testament, testify, and testimony. Seriously.
Now, this is scary. Ms Freud had to testify in court yesterday …. I just hope she wasn’t grabbing anyone’s nuts.
Thus endeth today’s biblical word study.

I don’t give a fuck if someone has a giant pile of cash if they earned it. Or if they came up with a really, really good invention and made a giant pile of cash off that..
For the most part, I’m content with what I have – even glad to have what I do. Oh sure, it’s fun to play the “what if” game… “What if” we hit the Powerball? (I’d buy up several square miles of Appalachian mountain range and build a big fuckin fort… probably something that looked like Helms Deep… call it “Fort Badass”. Then buy a big pile of gold and silver bullion and pile it deep in the mountain)
What I hate is when people – very SMART people – use the system in a way it was not designed to be used, in effect abuse it, and make shattering amounts of money while a great many other people – usually dupes – are soaked for a great deal of money… SMART does not mean honest, honorable, fair or even good… it just means they’re smart enough to figure out a way to manipulate the system (sometimes in collusion with others) and make out like a bandit. Do THOSE people “work harder”? No. They’re smarter than the average bear, I’ll give them that… but am I jealous of them? No. I’m angry that these weasels can do what they do and skate with no repercussions…
I’m not jealous of what someone else has… If someone makes good, then good for them. But those who pillage and raid? Those fucks need to swing from a lamp-post…

LMFAO!! I was just talking about that fucking guy with the question marks all over his jacket! Said that he reminded me of The Riddler, but cheezier..
I can totally relate to “Plumbing for Dummies”. Last few times we have called for a plumber, we’ve either got some inept kid who is apprenticing or some ancient guy.
Now, I’m not opposed to ancient guys, since they pretty much spent their lives making mistakes and they know their shit backwards and forwards… but the QUALITY of the work we usually get is sub-standard. Couple weeks ago, we had a couple pipes burst (along with everyone else in America) and the plumber that ended up “fixing” our burst pipes had to come back THREE FUCKING TIMES to get it right….
And the hell of it is, IT’S STILL NOT RIGHT! So, I dug into my Great Library and got out the book on plumbing. Bought what I needed from Ace Hardware and I’M gonna fix that motherfucker…. totally within my skill set.

Thermocouple problems on Gas FiresLakers finally get their act together
JAN 25, 2013 10:21p ET
They communicated on the court. They shared the ball. They played defense. Oh, and they even figured out how to win a game.
It really happened. Everything that has been going wrong, including a reported heated exchange among players this week in Memphis, was set aside during a resounding 102-84 victory over the Utah Jazz.
Sustaining the good feelings is another story, but it's possible the Lakers may have found a launching pad to something good. Only time will tell.
"If we can stay there and keep playing hard and keep being together, then we should be able to crawl out of this hole," coach Mike D'Antoni said. "But it's a big hole."
A crater is more like it. The win ended the Lakers' four-game losing streak, but they're still seven games under .500 and four games out of the final playoff spot in the Western Conference. One victory isn't going to turn around their season, but Friday's game showed them how they can win by playing cohesively.
One way: distributing the ball and giving opposing defenses more to worry about than just Kobe Bryant.
Bryant matched his season low with 14 points but had a season-high 14 assists. Steve Nash and Pau Gasol had 15 points apiece, Howard and Metta World Peace 17 each. Bryant missed a triple-double by one rebound.
"We played hard," Bryant said. "We played smart. The energy was there, the execution was there."
As for his assist total, which was just one off his career high set in 2002, Bryant said: "I just tried to manipulate the defense as much as I can and tried to forced the game upon our guys and have them play with confidence. They did a great job making shots."
One effect was to engage Howard early in the game. The Lakers center, who complained after the team's shoot-around about negativity surrounding the team, was active in the low post from the first few moments, scoring six of his team's first nine points, including two dunks off alley-oop passes from Bryant.
A more energized Howard also played well on defense, finishing with 13 rebounds and two blocked shots. The Lakers shot 53.8 percent for the game and held the Jazz to 42 percent.
"I thought he was just extremely aggressive," Bryant said of Howard. "He was going after every shot on defense, tried to change every shot, (went) after every rebound. He was extremely active in the passing lanes and his post defense. I thought he played a phenomenal floor game."
Howard insisted that any ill feelings that were expressed during a closed-door team meeting in Memphis were left behind. If that's true, it can only be interpreted as a positive step forward for a team that has been going backward.
"Tonight our effort and our energy were there from the beginning," Howard said. "We just have to sustain it for the rest of the season.
"We have to play together. We have to play for each other. That's the only way we're going to win."
It surely won't be easy. The Lakers face the conference-leading Oklahoma City Thunder on Sunday at Staples, and anything less than another solid effort could push them back from where they came.
They know it, too.
"When we hit turbulence somewhere along the road, we just can't bail out," D'Antoni said. "We've got to keep going through it. It's not going to be smooth all the time, but that's when we've got to come?The Smile House Chiangmai is perfectly located for both business and leisure guests to Chiang Mai.

Mouse over maps for more informationSushil Kumar Shinde would help the cause of Muslims a lot more if he spoke a little less. In February this year, the Union Home Minister declaimed on ‘Hindu terror,’ when the correct expression should have been Hindutva-linked terror. The remarks caused an uproar that needlessly returned attention to ‘Muslim terror,’ a phrase as offensive and inaccurate as ‘Hindu terror.’ There was substance in what Mr. Shinde meant to convey — that a Hindutva connection had surfaced in some terror acts earlier attributed to ‘Muslims.’ But the heat generated by his comments left no room for a realistic evaluation of the state of terror investigation in this country. The minister has now done an encore with his letter to Chief Ministers cautioning them against wrongful detention of innocent Muslim youths in the name of fighting terror. The Bharatiya Janata Party has predictably accused Mr. Shinde of going against the spirit of the Constitution and dividing the country on religious lines. The minister need not have made a case for “innocent Muslims.” The cause for justice would have been fully served even if he had only stressed the need for impartial and thorough investigation leading up to efficient and speedy trials. Because this is the key to ensuring no innocent person is harassed. And this is also the key to preventing vendetta policing and investigation against innocent Muslims.
The unfortunate truth is that Muslims are the first to be picked up in the aftermath of a terrorist strike. Anti-terror squads conduct ‘combing operations’ in Muslim neighbourhoods and what follows is the by-now well- documented nightmare of illegal detention, torture and forced confessions followed by denial of bail and years in prison. Case after case has ended in acquittal because of shoddy investigation, of course, but also often because the terror accused were never involved in the crime in the first place. Over the years, biases have got entrenched in the policing mechanism which can only be corrected by professionalising investigation and incorporating forensics and other scientific tools to minimise error and narrow down suspects. The Supreme Court, in the D.K. Basu case, laid down detailed guidelines for detention procedures to reduce the scope of arbitrary arrests and custodial torture. It should surprise no one that the guidelines are rarely, if at all, observed. The tragedy with Muslims is that the system that treats them as suspects is also conditioned to stymieing measures aimed at their rehabilitation. What Muslim youth need is genuine equality before the law, something that is often denied them. Sadly, Mr. Shinde’s statement makes it sound as if they need to be shown some special favour.
Keywords: Muslims, Sushilkumar Shinde, Hindu terror remark, Muslim terror, Muslim youth, innocent Muslims, Hindutva-linked terror
The Man Mohan Singh government has a good reputation of not encouraging
communal riots in its tenure compared to other previous governments.
However the the article fully justified and the Shinde's said letter
has nothing to do with the problems of terror related innocent Muslims.
The letter has only an eye to the coming election and perhaps aimed to
raise a controversy. It is an irony of Indian politics that in the past
the differences and controversies among various castes, religions,
regions along with violences have well paid in terms of votes to one or
other party. The coming election is destined to present similar
scenarios to us.
As you put correctly in the article, a more helpful thing to the
community would have been to pressurize the states to implement the
Supreme Court guidelines for detention procedures laid down to reduce
the scope of arbitrary arrests and custodial torture.
yes good editorial and unbiased as well.will serve purposes.
I have 2 points to make -
HM should have said if there are any instances of terror suspects held for too long without proper reason and evidence then heads would roll. No one can use authority to victimize or protect only a community. So, HM clearly given wrong instructions.
Second point, if any media house is trying to convince us that UPA is secular then they will be branded as paid media. Have no doubt about it ... it is crystal clear it most communal govt we ever had. These guys have been able to do nothing to secure internal peace and harmony and are just appeasing.
One clear thought to my muslim friends ..... if they are voting to Congress because they will protect muslims ... this selfish thinking is not right for the nation. Whatever you ask .... ask for everyone including you.
Shinde has a chronic "Foot in the Mouth" disease. He comes up with
howlers like this at regular intervals. What makes this one contentious
is that it is in the form of a letter from the HM. Otherwise, few take
him seriously.
I agree that, in view of the terrorist activities of a miniscule
number of persons of their community, the entire muslim community is
looked at with suspicion. We fail to understand that most of the
Indian Muslims were converted either by FEAR OR FAVOUR. So the country
belongs to the Muslims too and they should be treated equally.
The usage of words like HINDUTWA terror or Hindu terror is also
equally objectionable. This is denigrading the entire Hindu community.
You call Terrorists, simply TERRORISTS. They do not belong to any
religion. God is a concept and people who propagate different Gods
are businessmen, who sell their version of the product, i.e. GOD. Good
preachers have taught a samaritan way of living with equality for all
and the preachings of such great men have now been turned into
different theories for different Gods. It is better, the people
understand this universal truth and spurn all types of men who
propagate hatred among the creatures of the world.
Why he had such thought god only knows. Being a home minister of this country and all the premier invesitigating agencies could able pull required data for him to assess whether really it happened as he assumed or before writing such letter to all state government. Every policie department and investigating having the fear of violation of human rights and when it comes to detain of terrorsit they takes at most care in most of the time and work on the tip of premier investigatin agencies inputs majority time. Being a country home minister should not deliver such community appeasing statement if he had really suspicious in that act in accordance with facts and figures.
The article's second line which rephrases Mr. Shinde's comment of Hindu terror with Hindutva linked terror is an endorsement of his comment. Hind is the land beyond the Indus river and Hindutva is the way of lifestyle of these people. It is the ethos of every Indian. Firstly, terror cannot be classified and must not be classified. Hindutva is not an ideology its a part and parcel of every Indian. Its our identity. Secondly, in a secular country like India linking anything with religion and especially pro minority is just an appeasement tactic. There are so many youths arrested wrongly under the stringent goonda act. Mr. Shinde did it again. Come elections govt remembers everything. Moreover law and order is a state subject, so this entire letter to Chief ministers is a simple tactic to fool Muslims that Congress is the Messiah for the minorities.
As a home minister Mr shindhe should not issue such type of circular in
stead he should have insisted on speedy trail of the cases by the
judiciaries on proper inquiries .He should take steps for setting up the
special court courts for terror related cases.The home should avoid such
type of activities in future to avoid unnecessary political controversy.
Supreme court should ban politicians to politic over caste and religious.
By writing such letter, the Honorable Home Minister has not only shown
stupidity, but has offended the fundamental rights framework of the
constitution; i.e. article 14 (equality before law and equal
protection of law), article 15 (non-discrimination on grounds of
religion,race,caste,sex or place of birth) and article 20 (protection
in respect of conviction for offences). He should have instructed the
States to check the unlawful detention of any citizen for that matter.
Clearly a specific religion based statement is to appease the Muslim
voters, but in vain!
The Govt.has constituted Special Legal Cells to help those who
are implicated in terror linked case from the Minority community
free of charge.This -though against the Spirit of Secularism since
the reports show 65% of the undertrials languishing in Jails are
from the majority community who have not financial background to engage lawyers to argue their cases - should DO the job to Track and get the Innocent freed from trumped up charges.Mr.Shinde should
have sent a Study Team comprising NEUTRAL observers to find out
how many Dalits are incarcerated on flimsy and un substantiated
charges filed by Rich and Powerful to steal their land OR WORSE
BREAKING THE UNTOUCHABILITY TABOOS
this is rarely expected from a home minister what Mr shinde has said.
but now the problem with our country is that those siting in high power
positions are either having no understanding or vision of our countries
politics or are too much vote and power minded.
All of us are biased by our perceptions. The last sentence in the editorial also is
biased.
"What Muslim youth need is genuine equality before the law, something that is often
denied them. "
in our police system genuine equality is denied every weak person. It is the weak
whether muslims, poor or out of state visitors, or two wheeler driving youth, or Tata
ace drivers who do not have immediate access to those in power, are the harassed
lot.
All are equal before law. But this is not so and is the legacy from the british raj. I
remember the sayings in police circle, they round up people with out oil in their hair
to solve petty theft cases. They will readily admit to the theft for they do not have
money to even hair oil and will not have money to engage lawyers.
The premise of this article, that Mr. Shinde wants to help the Muslims,
is itself unfounded. He just wants their votes, not their betterment. I
think the author does a great favour to Mr. Shinde and grave injustice
to Muslims by assuming what he has assumed.
Our ministers act as he would have minister of one community or one group. Instead
of this they should act as real minister who think about national interest or national
integrity.if they will do that half of the problem of India would automatically solve.
If we take this by context, Most of the educated folk of our country are aware of this "UNFORTUNATE truth". What is stopping for media from bringing these false accused stories into public domain, Media has always played a savior of this country from many elements which could have gone unnoticed and neutralized from public domain , By hiding these stories in which innocents are targeted by false allegations,by hiding truth under whatever pressure they have , media is proving in itself, it is no more an third eye of the country, but yet another marketing agent, who just markets what its master ask it to do. VERY UNFORTUNATE. Thanks Hindu, to be closer to honesty in this era of disguise
Shinde should have avoided the usage of muslim youth when he wrote the
letter. As a Minister he should have written about wrongful arrest of
any person whether he is a youth or old person. Further a CPM central
committee member Mohammed Salim has stated that "We forced Shinde to
write the letter." The investigative agencies are also wrong when they
start airing the opinion that the IED used points out to some
similarity with another blast and make a particular community suspect.
They shall not express any opinion before completing the thorough
investigation. Arresting of all innocents are to be condemned.
What we need is people who can think critically and not
irrationally.
One can not expect a person to be critical thinker without good
social education(not to be confused with going to college or
school).
New subjects like social engineering, communalism, questioning our
thoughts, ethics and moral are the areas that need to be educated.
A balanced and thoughtful editorial.
But as long as politicians are permitted to get away with "exploiting"
any community, small or large, on any criteria (usually religion,
caste, region, language etc) is there any hope of anything changing
ever?
To eradicate these problems, which is essential to the progress of
India and all Indians, there needs to be a root cause analysis and
proper understanding of steps that must be implemented to prevent
recurrence. When the present Govt is willing to enact illegal and
immoral laws simply to stay in power (euphemistically called
"coalition compulsions") what chance is there of this happening?
Have educated Indians any alternative to opening their eyes and minds
to the danger the country is facing and the misery their future
generations will definitely face? The country needs millions of
Kejriwals.
With Shinde and Digvijay Singh, UPA needs no enemies. They can implode the Congress Party's chances in any election. The Prime Minster and the party hier-archy (aka The Gandhis) need to stop these loose canons.
1. The need of the hour is to ask Shinde to espouse the cause of
Muslim youths 2. I have a suspicion that he really wants other way
out. 3.He opens Pandora Box. 4. This is similar to our PM 's call "
Muslims have the first preference of natural wealth of this country "
5. Now Muslim youths especially Muslim Girls are turning to education
in large number 6. Many IAS ,Police officials and Profs. are Muslims .
6. While they have have turned to constructive things such ill-timed
announcements cause trouble to Muslims. 7 Probably that is what Shinde
wants ,it seems
The Late V K Krishna Menon,was asked by a reporter,evidently trying
to pull his legs,what the Indian Army is doing in(may be Congo).The
reply was,they are U N deputed soldiers, of Indian
Personnel.Terrorists are Terrorists,first,second and third.Trying to
identifying their religion is for Political Dishonesty.
In my opinion, this is indeed a secular editorial and we need more of
such thinking in our society. However, there is one thing I fail to
understand: If "Muslim extremism" is a non-secular phrase, then how is
the phrase "Hindutva terror" secular? According to a 1995 Supreme
Court judgement the word Hindutva could be used to mean "the way of
life of the Indian people and the Indian culture or ethos". The word
"Hindutva terror" links all people who practice the Indian way of life
to terrorism. Thus, I object to the usage of this word in this
context.
Minorities, specially Muslims seldom get timely justice in India.
Thousands of Muslim youth are languishing in jails on trumpet up
charges of terrorism or suspicion of terrorism. Nothing has been done
for them, to either try and convict them or try and release them.
Their lives have been dealt a deadly jolt. They have just become
zombies, in-significant human beings where State does not value their
life. It is a travesty, it is gross injustice. India has become a huge
concentration camp for Muslims dispersed in different regions. An
entire generation of Muslim youth have socially, economically and
morally been decimated. Media does not write about them, government at
various levels are apathetic. World is oblivious because India
is democracy. The world does not know that India is not a democracy
for the minorities. It is huge "gulag".

Presenter of the DVD Your First Garden Made Easy, Toby designs gardens around the world and lectures widely on garden history and garden design.The I Like Big Gas!! team rode their Suzuki GSX-R1000 to victory at the Central Motorcycle Roadracing Association's (CMRA) 4 Hour Championship Endurance race of the season this past Saturday, February 15, 2014. CMRA held its first round of Championship Endurance, Lightweight Endurance, and Mini Sprint grids, bringing over 10 hours of racing action to Texas World at MSR Houston in Angleton, Texas. Good weather with temperatures in the 70's, and a steady breeze made for great track conditions on the 2.4-mile clockwise course.
The Mini Sprint grids ran on the 1.3-mile short course and were a great warm up for the endurance races, with Formula 4 and E Superstock having 27 and 31 entries each. The Junior Motard class, for younger racers age 8-12, also had some good racing with only 0.407-second separating the first and second place finishers at the checkers.
The inaugural round of the new CMRA Lightweight Endurance series ran a 2-Hour endurance on the 1.3-mile short course with a combined grid of 42 teams and classes including 500 Supersport, 300 Supersport, 500 Classic, E Superstock , and Formula 4. As the start lights went out for the first race of the season, the Super Awesome Machine team of Jesse Davis, and David Tiede put their heads down and grabbed the lead on their Honda CBR500R. The F Bomb Racing team of Brian Millsap, Thomas Delaney, and Dirk Anderson riding a Kawasaki EX300, had their hands full with the Forza Monica team of Jude Monica, Lissa Deeter, Ryan Andrews, and Mark Andrews, also on a Kawasaki EX300, and the race leaders battling pulled them away from the rest of the pack by a lap.
A red flag was brought out on lap 11 with two riders going down, and the bikes were gridded in running order until it cleared. Taking the restart and building momentum back up, the race leaders went right back at it, stretching a lead over the rest of the field.
Heading into the final hour the competition stayed strong, and coming into the checkers F Bomb Racing shook off Forza Monica for the win in 300 Supersport and first overall by 3 seconds. Forza Monica crossed the line for second overall and second in 300 Supersport. The Faltless Racing team of Eric Falt, Bill Erzal, Ted Phillips, and Robert Bradlaw finished third overall and first in 500 Classic.

The Excel EMR team of Conner Blevins and Dustin Meador on a Kawasaki ZX636 was in the mix with the Yamaha YZF-R6 mounted LocoMotion team of Alonzo Contreras, Mark Windham, Ryan Max Johnson, and Matt Vastine, vying for third. Lead rider for I Like Big Gas!! Brandon Young fought through the pack and immediately put a 2 second lead on the field with the Village Idiots in hot pursuit. As the afternoon wore on, I Like Big Gas!! held their lead, their second rider Craig Montgomery stretching it to 44 seconds heading into the final hour. The Village Idiots kept a firm grip on second, and when I Like Big Gas!! took too long on a pit stop, Garet Tomlinson, riding for the Village Idiots, took the lead and stretched out a 22 second gap between them and I like Big Gas!! Dewayne Davis, the final rider for I like Big Gas!! came out of the pits on fire and went after Tomlinson, chasing him down. The Village Idiots had one pit stop left for fuel, and Davis took full advantage, staying out instead of pitting in, and retaking the lead and widening the gap back to 40 seconds.

Big
Gas Racing Wins CMRA’s Overall and A Superbike Endurance at MSR Houston
Big Gas Racing (BGR), a brand new team in the CMRA Championship Endurance
Series, started off with a dramatic win. Brandon Young, a CMRA regular, took an
early lead on the field with BGR’s Suzuki GSX-R1000 and held it throughout his
1 hour 12 minute stint. With lap times consistently in the 1:38 range, he held
station rode with a mission.
Young said, “We had limited time on the new bike and no idea what type of fuel
mileage to expect. In addition, we did very little pit stop practice. I knew I
had to ride as hard as possible. I wanted to create a cushion in the event
something went wrong later in the race.”
Second rider Craig Montgomery, had a solid performance. Prior to his ride
Montgomery commented, “Guess I’ll have to try a bit harder since Brandon is
handing me off the lead.” His second leg stint got serious quick. Montgomery
exited the pits with a 27 second lead in hand and he extended to 45 seconds.
Montgomery, who is focusing his efforts this season on endurance riding, ran
steady times in the 1:40’s with an occasional lap in the 39’s. More
importantly, Montgomery managed to stay out almost 15 minutes longer than
Young, and may have been the deciding factor in this race.
The third and final stint of the race was manned by Dewayne Davis, who is
returning to regular racing this season after some time off. Davis had some
minor excitement to contend with prior to his ride when rear tire change took
longer than anticipated (90 seconds) and Davis entered the track in second
position. With the GSX-R1000 full of fuel, lap times were in the 1:43s. The
lead rider was disappearing into the distance, but about 30 minutes into his
leg, Davis found his groove and came to grips with his ride. As the fuel burned
off, the lap times dropped.
Circulating down into the 1:37s, Davis eventually ran the fastest lap of the
race and regained the lead. The real drama occurred in the final moments of the race.
With under ten minutes left, the team in second place hunting Davis down,
pitted for a fuel stop. With 4 minutes left, the gas light came on for Davis,
and his run down the straight created panic in the pit as he gestured at his
tank. BGR pit chief and rider Scott Buckley gave no indication that Davis would
pit. However, luck was on their side, as Davis passed the timing and scoring
beacon as time expired to take the checkers and the win before the bike ran out
of fuel on the last lap!
Davis was all smiles when he said, “I wasn’t coming in! I know that I’m racing
the clock and not the checkers. I knew how much time was left so I stayed out.”
Big Gas Racing celebrated as Davis and his silent GSXR were pushed into the
pits. A truly dramatic finish to a great first race!
BGR would like to thank the CMRA as well as its sponsors: Pirelli, South
Central Race Center, P1 Racing, Vesrah, Silkolene, Pilot, and 680 Construction
as well as family, friends and crew.Several BPS members took advantage of mini-grants available for local networking events in 2012.

See Officer Tsujimoto's Officer Down page
SAN FRANCISCO — A 15-year San Francisco police veteran who headed the department's canine unit died, apparently of a heart attack, during a training exercise Monday night on Treasure Island, department officials said Tuesday.
Darryl Tsujimoto, 41, of Alamo had just run a half a mile with a department dog, leading the exercise to track a suspect, when he collapsed at 9 p.m., said acting Capt. Dan McDonagh of the tactical unit.
"Just at the same point the dog located the pretend bad guy, he went down," McDonagh said. "His fellow officers didn't know if this was part of the training. His partner thought he was just adding something to the scenario. She questioned him for a second, and he just wasn't responsive."
Tsujimoto was taken to San Francisco General Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.
McDonagh said Tsujimoto was in good shape and often ran alongside the dogs he handled — Loki, a German shepherd, and Barak, a Belgian Malinois. Both were dogs he had owned, trained and donated to the department.
"There was no indication at all that anything was going to happen," McDonagh said. "He was 41, a young man. It is devastating."
Under Tsujimoto's leadership, the canine unit won gold medals in several national competitions. Tsujimoto had also served in the Mission, Taraval, Park and Tenderloin Task Force stations, and in the narcotics and vice units.
"He was dedicated to dogs," McDonagh said. "He loved animals. It was his passion."
Police Chief Heather Fong said Tsujimoto's efforts made the canine unit a "showpiece for the department."
"His passing has immeasurably saddened all of us," she said.
"He was a very talented officer, with a wealth of experience and knowledge," McDonagh said. "He would go out of his way to help train people."
Davin Cole, a 13-year-veteran who is part of the canine unit, said Tsujimoto had died fulfilling his dream of working with dogs and supervising nine other officers in the canine unit.
"He loved what he did. He wouldn't have it any other way," Cole said.
Tsujimoto was engaged to be married, Cole said. He had no children.

DailyKos Death Worshipping: Requiem for a Death Panel
I am speechless at the prolific horror I have come across at the DailyKos. See here:
All I am saying here is, I understand what its like to watch an 80+ year old loved one suffer through their last moments, and I am not one to judge what anyone would do in that situation – it is their business. But this diary is just flat out horrific, disgusting, ignorant of life, and wanting of humanity. For all those nutcases on the left who bashed Sarah Palin for her “death panels” “rumor”, see the above linked requiem for a sanity check, and then tell me what you think about Gov. Palin’s “rumor.”Sun City Macdonald Ranch Real Estate

-The table looks perfect festooned with all sorts of beautiful Thanksgiving table decorations, china and silver. A lovely cornucopia sits proudly as the centerpiece of the table surrounded by just the right amount of candles. The buffet table is almost groaning with all sorts of Thanksgiving delights. Your family and friends fill their plates and sit down to enjoy dinner when what do you hear, “Uhhhh that’s gross! I’m not eating that!”? The universal cry of the picky kid-eater! But don’t despair there is help! Here is your plan on how to make a kid friendly Thanksgiving dinner with recipes included.
The key to planning a kid friendly Thanksgiving is not to have to cook two meals. While you want to please all your guests no matter what age they are, the work of two complete menus is not what you are looking for on a cooking intensive holiday like Thanksgiving. So if you feel you need to plan an alternative for your younger guests, try to focus on dishes that can be combined with the main menu. You may find by using a little creativity that your older guests may want what the kids will be having!
The main stars of the meal may be the ones that need the least altercation for the younger set. Many kids are happy to try sliced turkey and mashed potatoes but in case they are not try the following substitution for those younger finicky palates:
Turkey-Instead of traditional roast turkey offer:
Chicken legs: these can be roasted alongside the turkey in the final roasting hours. Kids love being able to grab onto them. If simple roasting of the chicken legs won’t do, then consider smearing them in honey and coating with crushed corn flakes. Fry the chicken until done for a sweet and crunchy entree for the kids.
Chicken tenders: Most kids will automatically gobble up these upscale versions of the chicken nugget. Lots of good chicken tenders come already breaded and ready for baking or frying but you can make your own quite simply with a basic egg and flour breading. Frying will give a better crunch but these can then be baked off in the oven for about 12-15 minutes at 350 degrees until cooked through. Offer them with a selection of dipping sauces-kids especially love ranch and sweet and sour sauce.
Mashed potatoes-Again this is generally a kid friendly choice if it is served without the upscale additions of roasted garlic, chives or sour cream that many adults will love. If plain mashed potatoes don’t pass the test try these alternatives:
Sweet potatoes-Many adults are disbelieving that any child would eat these but with the added sweetness of this type of potato many kids will gobble them down. The color is another plus as kids prefer a colorful plate. While many adults may turn away from this overly sweet recipe try this-Mash your sweet potatoes to the same consistency of regular mashed potatoes. Add butter and a small amount of apple juice to bring the potatoes to the right consistency. When you feel they are the right thicknesses spread them into a gratin pan and cover with marshmallows. They will only need a quick brown in a 350 degree oven to melt the marshmallows and warm the sweet potatoes through.
Fries or tator tots-If all else fails open a bag of frozen fries or tator tots and oven bake for the best flavor. Offer a variety of dipping sauces for the kids and you are set.
Dessert-This is the highlight of any meal and especially Thanksgiving. While you don’t want your youngest guests to feel left out, kids generally do not like the more grown up taste of pumpkin pie or other traditional offerings of the Thanksgiving dessert buffet. Try these for a sweet finish that even your youngest guest will like.
Sugar Cookies-This type of dessert can also serve as a craft to keep young guests occupied. Either bake your favorite sugar cookie recipe (this can be done even a few days before) or feel free to purchase already baked and undecorated sugar cookies from your local bakery. Cookies can be made into several Thanksgiving shapes to reflect the holiday spirit. Then all you need to do is provide your young guests with icing, candy sprinkles and other needed decorations for them to decorate their cookies and then eat them too!
Trifle-Many kids will eat the seemingly sophisticated dessert known as trifle. This is simple and easy to assemble. Simply choose a large bowl and layer your favorite cake (crumbled brownies or cookies will work too) into the bottom of the bowl. The next layers can be placed in any order. Use pudding, fruit and whipping cream to alternate with your cake layer. When you reach the top simply cover with whipping cream and refrigerate until time to serve. Kids love the creamy, sweet consistency of this dessert.Rod Wheaton made his first trip to Walt Disney World as a child just weeks after it opened in 1971.

Estelle - Boho Glam is rated 3.6 out of 5 by 10.
Rated 4 out of 5 by AshM from Love it! I love Estelle! It goes on solid in two coats, and dries quickly. The odd thing about it is, once it chips, it comes off completely. I learned this the hard way when I was absentmindedly scratching my head one day, and discovered that the polish on my middle finger was gone (#dreadheadproblems). Otherwise its a great color and very sparkly, and great for Halloween!

Rated 4 out of 5 by Corey from Didn't Expect the Texture Usually Julep lets you know when a polish is going to have a texture to it, but the texture that came with Estelle was a surprise to me! I received it free on one of the trick or treat deals Julep was running, and I was pretty excited to receive it. I did three coats to get the opacity I wanted, and each coat revealed a texture similar to the sea salt finish Julep does, but the 'grit' wasn't quite as fine. I applied a top coat and that smoothed it out. I love the black and holo glitters though. Happy I got to try it out, and maybe next time I'll keep the texture!

Rated 3 out of 5 by yarrow from it's ok I was very excited for this polish, but it's not as awesome as I thought it would be. It's more textured and less glittery than I expected. The texture is kind of cool but as far as being a glitter polish is concerned, this one is a bit dull. It goes on smooth, dries quickly and evenly, and is fully opaque with three coats. I like it but I don't love it. I think it would have been better without the texture, if the sparkles shined through a smooth black base.

Rated 5 out of 5 by Ruskii from My favorite! Estelle has ruined other nail polishes for me. My first Julep order was the Galaxy mystery box, and now it's all I ever want to wear. Plenty of other gorgeous polishes and I still go for this one half the time. Looks great with the sandy finish it dries to or glossy with a topcoat. I usually do 3 coats for a day or two, then put a glossy topcoat for a few days since I can't decide which way I like better.

"By our review there is plenty of horsepower available," Keane said in a discussion heavy on automobile analogies as board members struggled to understand the complexities of information technology project management. Keane said the task plan Deloitte is developing will run thousands of lines.
MNsure hired Deloitte for $5 million in April to be its new general contractor and provide a roadmap for overhauling the state-run system, which struggled with technical problems that led to long call center waits during last fall's first open enrollment period. Enrollment has grown to over 259,000, however, and Keane said MNsure is getting the system into better shape for this fall.
"It's encouraging to see the momentum there," he said. "I don't want to paint too rosy a picture. … It's going to be a difficult row to hoe, but not impossible."
Keane said much of MNsure's technical infrastructure is "contemporary and consistent with industry practices." But he said it's a complicated system that relies heavily on four commercial off-the-shelf software products from different vendors that need to work in harmony. The products deal with identity protection and security, eligibility determinations, plan shopping and selection, and payment processing. Each has its own interface for consumers, which he said makes the shopping experience similar to visiting multiple websites — and potentially confusing.
There have been growing calls among Minnesota Republicans this campaign season to scrap MNsure, which is the state's main component of the Obama administration's health care overhaul. GOP-endorsed gubernatorial candidate Jeff Johnson issued a statement Wednesday calling MNsure a "technological disaster" and saying that fixing the website won't solve the bigger problems of rising premiums.
Alycia Riedl, president of the Minnesota Association of Health Underwriters, called on Democratic Gov. Mark Dayton's administration during the meeting to release 2015 premium rates as soon as possible so consumers and employers can make decisions. The administration says it won't do that until open enrollment begins Nov. 15. Republicans charge that the administration is deliberately withholding those rates until after the election because it's afraid premiums will be higher next year.
MNsure board members discussed the many decisions that lie ahead, but the possibility of dumping the system and switching to the federal exchange wasn't one of them.
"We've already made the big one — bet on what we have and double down and make it work," board member Thomas Forsythe said.
MNsure's executive director, Scott Leitz, said afterward that it was a more upbeat assessment than the first diagnosis Deloitte gave MNsure last month.
"We're happy that they're seeing good progress but we're eyes-wide-open that there's a lot of work to do," he said.

Carey Rasinski’s circle isn’t big, but it certainly is well traveled.
Carey Rasinski’s circle isn’t big, but it certainly is well traveled.
Carey’s radius mostly encompasses Nisswa, Lake Shore, Pequot Lakes and Pillager, and most recently includes being manager of the Lakes Area Food Shelf in Pequot Lakes and co-owner of Petals & Beans, a flower shop and coffee shop in Nisswa.
“I don’t get very far,” Carey said with a laugh about her endeavours in that circle of the lakes area.
The circle may be small, but the endeavours are numerous.
Born in Fairmont, Carey spent the first decade of her life there and in Excelsior in the Twin Cities. When she was in seventh grade, her family moved to the west side of Gull Lake, near what today is Jake’s City Grille.
She began working at Madden’s Resort at age 12, busing dishes. She became a waitress at age 13 and worked at Madden’s until graduating from Pillager High School.
“That was the best summer in the whole wide world,” she said of working at Madden’s after graduation. In fact, when she was sitting on the beach at age 18 a photographer took her picture for a postcard for Madden’s.
After attending the University of Minnesota-Duluth for a year after high school, Carey returned and married the Brainerd boy she’d started dating at age 16 — Ray Rasinski. The couple just celebrated their 35th wedding anniversary.
She was a waitress at Bar Harbor in Lake Shore for two summers “for the wonderful Audrey Daniels” before she and Ray had their first child, Rob. When Rob was 1 1/2, Carey worked for Dick and Suzanne Mans at Pauline’s in Brainerd.
Then her father, the late Barney Briggs, started Great Northern Equipment, a Honda engine distributorship, in a building on Hazelwood Drive in Nisswa. Carey was the company’s comptroller for 11 years. Her father then started Northern Contractors in the building next to Great Northern Equipment, the building that today houses Petals & Beans.
When her father sold his business, Carey went to work for her husband at Rasinski Construction. For two years she stained boards, trim and windows in the building that would become home to her own business.
Carey also worked as a secretary at Pillager High School for four years, where her children attended school. In addition to Rob, the family includes daughters Dyana and Katie, as well as four granddaughters.
“That was a fun job. It was fun being with all the kids,” Carey said.
She and Ray eventually bought property next door to where Carey grew up and built a home where they lived for eight years. For the last 12 years they’ve lived on 320 acres in Lake Shore, where Carey has nine horses and a donkey, 46 chickens, three peacocks, a duck, two cats and a dog.
Why own peacocks? “Why not?” Carey answers. She sells their feather at Petals & Beans.
In 2001, Carey saw an ad for a part-time manager for the food shelf, and she’s been there ever since.
“I needed to find something to keep me occupied,” Carey said. “What’s kept me there is the people.
“I really enjoy it — helping people. I’m a very firm believer in paying it forward,” she said.
In 2003, when they drove daughter Katie to college in San Diego, Carey noticed drive-through coffee shops everywhere.
“These were all up the West Coast — every couple of miles and they were no bigger than a fishhouse,” Carey said. “I said to my husband, ‘I can do that. I’d love to do that kind of thing.’”
When she couldn’t find a suitable spot along the Highway 371 corridor, daughter Dyana came up with the idea for Petals & Beans. Dyana runs the flower side of the business, and Carey does the coffee.
Petals & Beans opened in 2005 in the Northland Center on the east side of Highway 371. In March 2011, the business, along with Animal House, moved from Northland Center to their current building on the west side of the highway, the building Carey’s dad owned.
“It’s really like coming back home,” she said. “I’ve lived here for so long and my dad knew so many people. It’s like home.”
Other ventures for Carey include breeding and selling paint horses and raising honeybees with friend Maria Erickson and selling the honey.
What’s next?
“I’d like to start growing mushrooms,” she said. “I love to do a lot of things.”Oct 29, 2010

On Monday, Nov. 8, from noon until 3 p.m., Ohio University will host an event at the Honors Collegium in Baker University Center to kick off OHIO’s participation in the United Appeal of Athens County’s annual fund drive.
The kickoff will be festive, featuring music provided by Aaron Thomas, local DJ, United Appeal board chair and owner of Class A Sounds.
Those who stop by can enjoy the music and pick up an afternoon snack of free popcorn and soft drinks. United Appeal representatives from four agencies will also be on hand to answer questions and provide information about the organization.
Anyone who turns in his or her pledge card at the kickoff will immediately receive a United Appeal T shirt. There is no minimum donation to receive the shirt.
The United Appeal is a charitable organization designed to assist families and individuals throughout Athens County in meeting their basic needs of food, shelter, health care and children’s development.
The University has participated in the United Appeal’s annual fund drive since the organization’s founding 54 years ago.
“As a University community of friends and neighbors, we have a unique opportunity to support the great work of United Appeal and its member organizations, who support those in need living in our communities, said Ohio University President, Roderick J. McDavis. “By being a part of this campaign, we can help bolster United Appeal’s efforts and be part of something bigger than ourselves.”
The University is raising the stakes this year, with a financial goal of $85,000 and a participation goal of 20 percent among OHIO faculty and staff.
The fund drive presents an opportunity for University employees on the Athens Campus to give back to the community that gives OHIO so much.
And, as Thanksgiving approaches, the United Appeal is reaching out to those who are able to give back to those in need. New incentives also aim to send the message that giving does give back.
“Those who give to United Appeal describe a feeling that their ties to the community are strengthened through their gifts,” said Becky Watts, President McDavis’ chief of staff and chair of the University’s United Appeal campaign committee.
All donors, regardless of the amount donated, will receive a United Appeal T shirt. Those who donate $50 or more will receive a free pass to the Athena Cinema.
Watts then took a moment and reflected on the recent devastation left by the tornadoes that ripped through the county last month as an example of the type of need that United Appeal agencies address.
“By giving to United Appeal, many of us feel that we help families through the thousands of crises that happen every day of the year,” she said.
Pledge cards for the fund drive will be arrive in University department mailboxes.
The pledge cards are easy to fill out and United Appeal stresses that any level of participation is accepted.
OHIO hopes to not only spread the word about the kickoff event, but to relay the meaningful ways that United Appeal aids the needs of the surrounding community.

If your United Appeal giving letter arrived without a pledge card inserted, pledge cards will be available at Monday’s kickoff event.
There are two options for giving on each card:
Please fill out the form and drop it off at Monday’s event in the Baker University Center, from noon until 3 p.m.
If you cannot make it on Monday, all donations can be sent through Interoffice Mail to Cutler Hall, room 108. Please indicate “United Appeal Annual Find Drive” on the envelope.Later I bought this great firetruck - a 40 foot long 1941 American LaFrance "quintuplet" with a 65" ladder - thinking it would be "cool" as well as safer at altitude. It was cool all right but better for parades than roof work most of the time. Bonnie, lovely wife and corporate partner, had more sense but would at least pose for a picture.
I worked with some wonderful people. The business allowed me to work with my children, especially Vernon and Charlene, and with nephews Ethan and David, and with friends, like Michael, Seth, Tom, Chuck, Bill and Sharon who seemed to enjoy taking a break from their professional jobs once in a while especially to go to a fancy job in New York, Boston or Virginia to build Rumfords. Except that Sharon was afraid of heights. Mostly, though, I worked with Vernon and Tharon and Dean and an ever-changing cadre of young musicians like Nate.
The Superior Clay throats and smoke chambers cost a few hundred dollars - really not any more than the expensive refractory materials I had been using - but their main benefit was to speed up the work saving as much as two day's work.
Look at the new construction process series where we built the fireplace up to the top of the smoke chamber in about four hours using the Superior Clay Rumford throat and smoke chamber. When I had to do it myself it used to take me a couple of days to set forms, pour the castible, wait for it to cure, strip the forms and clean up castings.

Participation in COPE begins with a specialized and thorough evaluation, including detailed interviews and neuropsychological testing. This includes tests of sensory perception and brain imaging. Participants also have the opportunity to be involved in other studies that include brain imaging and genetics, and open-ended interviews. Participants are compensated in cash for all research participation.
COPE offers a variety of clinical services for participants in the study.
COPE re-evaluates participants every three months for four years. Our goal is to understand people as they grow and change over time. For this reason, we touch base with our participants regularly, whether or not they choose to come in for treatment. Follow-up appointments are relatively brief but are important for monitoring each person’s well-being.
COPE understands that making the decision to go for a psychological evaluation can be difficult. Many who come to our clinic are seeking help for the first time and worry that they will be labeled with a psychiatric diagnosis rather than treated as a unique person. The treatment team at COPE is well aware of this concern and is dedicated to the consideration of each person as a whole, with his or her distinctive hopes, worries, strengths and needs.As a member of Sentinel Federal Credit Union, you have unlimited access to our auto buying website – AutoSMART.

Now, they have a chance to turn it into a leap.
After going 3-9 and 6-7 in Jerry Kill’s first two seasons at Minnesota — and 2-6 in the Big Ten both times — the Gophers are 7-2, 3-2 in the conference.
On Saturday, they will play a beatable Penn State team at TCF Bank Stadium before closing the regular season with tougher tests against Wisconsin and Michigan State.
The Gophers will have another bye week to regroup after the Penn State game, and here’s what a victory would mean:.
“We don’t really pay attention to it,” Kill said Sunday. “When I talked to the [players] last week, I said, ‘You need to enjoy the pats on the back. … You need to soak it in, and enjoy the moments. … But you can’t forget where you came from.’ ”
The Gophers flourished as underdogs, beating Northwestern, Nebraska and Indiana, but early betting lines are calling the Penn State game more of a toss-up.
The Nittany Lions (5-3, 2-2) needed overtime at home on Saturday to defeat an Illinois team that has dropped 18 consecutive Big Ten games, dating to 2011. Last month, Indiana defeated Penn State 44-24, but Bill O’Brien’s team came back the next and beat Michigan at home, also in overtime.
“There are a ton of good coaches in the Big Ten, but there’s nobody that did what that guy [O’Brien] did last year, with all the adversity that he faced,” Kill said. “That guy can coach football … and he’ll have his kids ready to play.”
It’s one of four trophy games for the Gophers. The teams will play for the Governor’s Victory Bell, which Minnesota last won in 2004. The Gophers are 0-4 against Penn State since then, with the last meeting coming in 2010, the year before Kill arrived.
Kill said the Gophers need their fans to pack the stadium and that the players have to come out hungry. But he doesn’t want to overstate the importance, either.
“I think we’re playing pretty loose right now,” he said. “I think early, we were pressing so much, and now they’re just playing hard and having fun, and not panicking.”
Kill pointed to the go-ahead drive at Indiana. The Gophers had squandered a 22-point lead and trailed the Hoosiers 39-35. But after returning from a hip pointer injury, sophomore quarterback Philip Nelson hit redshirt freshman tight end Maxx Williams for a 50-yard touchdown pass.
“We had to go down and score and threw the touchdown; that hasn’t happened since I’ve been here anyway,” Kill said. “We usually [hit] the panic button, and I promise you most people were going, ‘Oh, here we go again.’ ”
The Gophers caught their biggest break of the season with 25 seconds remaining, when Indiana tried a screen pass from the Gophers 9. Nate Sudfeld threw the ball backwards, behind running back Tevin Coleman, and after a painstaking pause, Gophers linebacker Aaron Hill grabbed the ball, securing the victory.
“I think every coach will tell you, ‘We’ve got a lot of room to get better yet,’ ” Kill said. “But [Saturday] was a prime example that if you play hard, sometimes things fall your way.”
Christenson has surgery
Starting center Jon Christenson had surgery Sunday after suffering a season-ending left leg injury in Saturday’s game. Kill couldn’t provide other details but said, “I just feel terrible. The game of football’s a great game, but it’s a hard game, and ... [Christenson] is a beautiful kid, and smart, so it’s a shame.”
Kill added, “It’s a shame, however the kid that came in [at center] just did a tremendous job — Tommy Olson. So that’s why we always preach about depth.”

When the project was first announced in 1999, the promise was that the journey from Alicante to Madrid would take 100 minutes. In fact, the time to cover the 500km journey will be 2 hours and 30 minutes which is just half an hour less than the present non stop train journey. The goal is to cut the time down to 2 hours 15 minutes once all the safety checks have been made. However, that is still a lot longer than the 1 hour 40 minute goal.
As for the cost of the journey, that has not been settled yet but could be between 70 and 90 euros.Worldwide Web
Jardin des Monts, available at the Palace Spa at the Gstaad Palace Hotel, is a new organic skincare line from Charlotte Landolt and Laetitia Jacot, two horticulturists who set out in 2006 to restore the fields surrounding a 19th-century chalet. Today the pair make use of more than 30 skin-enhancing local botanicals, all carefully tended by a flock of goats to help keep the pastureland from getting overgrown. Once mature, they're hand-picked, dried, and delicately stored in paper bags to preserve their nutrients. The popular Edelweiss Lip Balm is made with a mountain flower known as the "star of the Alps" because of its shape and brilliant white color; its extracts protect lips from UV exposure.

Since we've been obsessed with Sultra's flat iron for a while now, we decided to give their acclaimed curling tool a whirl. Instead of clamping your hair and curling it, this iron is a simple rod. Just wrap loose sections around it, and you'll wind up with crease-free naturally tousled waves. Plus, the iron works in half of the time of other styling tools (yes, it's true) thanks to constant and evenly distributed 360-degree heat.

Set List: Rock of Ages (Charlie Hall) & Move Me (Jordan Howerton Band) while writing and praying over prayer requests.
Scripture Used: Ephesians 4.1-7; 1 Corinthians 12.12-27
Additional Resources Used: 3 video clips from Go On (1×03 – There’s No Ryan in Team and 1×05 – Do You Believe in Ghosts… Yes!)
Evening in a Sentence: This week we explored how God intended (and still intends) for us to exist and live in the world… together. (Check out the Prezi here and the teaching notes here)
Element of Fun: Fellowship time over dinner.
What Worked: Tonight was a blessing for many of our students. We welcomed back our new student from last week who is loving being involved. Our Student Leaders prepared and served dinner and that went over very well. The lesson itself really sank in for several of our teens. We experimented with our music, challenging students to write two prayer requests – one that only God can answer, and one that is a need another human could meet – and place them on a chalkboard. At the end of the evening students were asked to pray for the requests and to take ones that God could help them answer. Even the more disruptive teens seemed to get on board with this experiment. The 30 Hour Famine message created strong support and registrations for our event coming up at the end of the month.
What Needs Work: Small space again. The Famine time felt long.
Summary: Like last week, tonight was another good, solid evening of ministry that left me feeling very encouraged at what God is doing in and through our teens. Getting a positive text message from a teen who was encouraged and challenged shortly after arriving home really cemented that for me.

Peter Mallen, 67, the founder of a high-tech textile company and president of The Temple in Atlanta from 2004 to 2006, was piloting the plane when it went down in a northwestern neighborhood of Atlanta.
On Oct. 20, 1998, his small plane crash-landed in a field near Rio Rancho, N.M., while on a flight from Las Vegas to Atlanta. Neither Mallen nor his passenger were injured, but the plane was destroyed.
In 1972, Mallen’s brother, Steven, was killed when his small plane crashed near Jasper, Ga., according to federal records.Return to SSD

These arrays can be used for various purposes such as the tracking of undersea vehicles, accurate bottom positioning of equipment and integrating changing locations of seabed mapping equipment with depth and altitude from the bottom information. We produce accurate AutoCAD generated coastal and bottom contour maps.
The following accomplishments are representative of the kinds of services that Rick Laney is capable of providing:
I was hired to serve as a Project Analyst for an Indonesian company, Submarine Safaris Asia. Submarine Safaris Asia purchased the Odyssey II submarine from a company in Vancouver, BC and entered into joint venture with them to build and operate an additional five submarines in Indonesia. The project became stalled when the manufacturer and joint venture partner over ran the contract amount of $2.2 million and only had the sub about 30% assembled. I was sent by the Indonesian buyer's representative to Vancouver to assess the situation. I audited the buyer's books, inventoried the submarine's parts and spares, determined how many more parts and spares would be needed to complete the sub and estimated their cost. I also estimated the additional time it would take to complete the sub and get it ready for shipment. The sub would take a year longer than the manufacturer's original contracted schedule and run $1.4 million over budget. The buyer agreed to continue funding the project if we could control the completion of the sub and remove the joint venture partner. I spent a month in intense negotiations between buyer and manufacturer in which time we effectively took over financial control of the manufacturer's corporation and canceled all previous agreements between Submarine Safaris Asia and their joint venture partner. The submarine was completed and shipped to Jakarta. All this was done while work was continuing on the submarine and without the involvement of attorneys.
I then did a site survey in Bali, Indonesia where the Indonesians had purchased land and started construction on a restaurant, swimming pool and pier from which they intended to operate the Odyssey II. An analysis of the local 9 foot tidal cycle revealed that the water would drop to 3 feet of depth at the end of the pier up to 35 times a month. We also measured periodic 3 knot currents at the end of the pier and 2 knot currents and 30 foot visibility at the intended dive site. These conditions make it difficult to successfully operate a tourist submarine.
Solutions to difficult problems: I took on the job figuring out how to dock an 80 ton submarine drawing 9 feet of draft at a pier standing in 3 feet of water with a three knot current ripping around the end. To complicate matters, the local authority would not allow dredging or the construction of breakwaters in the area. They would also not allow the construction of a maintenance facility on the beach or pier.
The result was the concept and development of a self propelled Launch, Recovery, Transport and self contained Maintenance Vessel for the tourist submarine. I worked as the Design Engineer and doubled up as the Project Manager throughout the main hull design phase. The client wanted the vessel completed in the shortest possible time frame. I implemented a fast track design/build program in which the design rushed to keep ahead of simultaneous parallel construction. This unique two deck, 350 ton displacement, "U" shaped vessel had a water ballasted, air blown center section that would lower the sub into the water for launching and then recover the sub by raising it up to lower deck level with the sub's topside deck protruding up through an opening in the maintenance vessel's top deck. Maintenance shops, store rooms, generator rooms, crew quarters, pilot house, compressor rooms, scuba room, etc. wrap around the sub on three sides of both levels. Propulsion consisted of a hydrostatic vertical lift and tilt stern thruster and a 360 degree steerable Schottel pump jet for the bow. This system allowed the vessel to maneuver in any direction in 3 feet of water against a three knot current while only drawing 2.6 feet of draft with the sub aboard. This vessel was put into operation in Bali.
Roberts Hawaii Tours Inc: Subcontracted the modifications to the Ali'i Kai catamaran from Navatek and Hawaii Marine. Produced detailed Naval Architectural design drawings of the Ali'i Kai's modifications which included a new food preparation area, fire doors and bulkheads and an observation deck that wrapped around the upper level's bow section. The plans were approved by the Coast Guard on the first submittal and the observation deck was built exactly according to the plans.

Circular object in No. CA streaking towards Mt. Diablo State Park area
My wife and I had just returned from a local trip when we noticed something moving in the Eastern sky. We immediately saw a bright circular object moving at a high rate of speed from the sky towards the ground (best guess is that the object was 2-3 miles away, headed towards the Mt. Diablo State Park area at a 45 degree angle). Object appeared as a very bright green circle of light surrounding a relatively dim red light, made no sound, and disappeared after only five seconds.Master of Science in Technology Management Information Session

Member sinceDec 26, 2011A small colony of pelicans will soon be nesting in Olde Towne Slidell, thanks to a Leadership Northshore class of 2013 project that will raise money to benefit the Children’s Wish Endowment. Almost all of the 24 fiberglass sculptures purchased for the Pelicans on Parade have been sponsored, according to Leadership team member Mike Thiel Sr., but some unexpected logistical concerns have pushed back the public display.
There are some insurance and safety concerns being worked out, Thiel said, and many of the businesses in Olde Towne Slidell where the birds will be displayed, are on city right-of-ways. He said these issues should be resolved and the parade on display in April.
"We're looking forward to showcasing these beautiful works of art," Thiel said.
Pelicans on Parade has engaged local artists to paint one-of-a-kind artworks on the 4-foot tall statues. The project is similar to public art exhibits that have included Cows on Parade in New York City and Streetcar Art in New Orleans. The first Pelicans on Parade works of art were on view during the recent Arts Evening.
“I’m really impressed by the quality of work” being done by the artists, Thiel said. “They’re true to the work the artists submitted for approval.” He estimates the project has already has raised more than $5,000 for Children’s Wish.
Artists participating include Phil Galatas, Cindy and Valerie Strecker, Yuki Northington, Adam Sambola, Jessica Bourgeois, Christine Blanchard Lowrance, Darlene Langendonk, Matt Litchliter, Mile Stephens Asche, Lori Gomez, Caron Sharpe and Elsie Semmes.
Sponsorship of a pelican is $750 and will include a plaque with the sponsor’s name or business. Sponsors who wish to keep the artworks can do so for a total cost of $1,250.
More than 30 artists submitted 50 designs that are available for selection. The local artist will receive a $200 stipend for painting the pelicans. After the artists are finished, the artworks are clear coated with an automotive finish.
So far, most of the sponsors want to keep the unique works of art, according to Leadership Northshore team member Laura Mauffray-Borchert. Others on the Leadership team include Danielle Evans and Jennifer Berger. Their mentors are Rene Arcemont and Catherine Olivier.
Pelicans on Parade will be showcased throughout the Slidell Main Street Corridor and at sponsor locations including Slidell Memorial Hopital, Ochsner Medical Center - North Shore, and Textron, Thiel said. Once the display is over, the pelicans that do not have owners will be put up for auction, perhaps tying in with a Children’s Wish Endowment fundraising event in the fall, he said.
The sponsorship deadline is “rolling,” Borchert said. “There’s no limit on the number of pelicans we’re able to get. We’re only limited by the number of sponsors we’re able to get.”

When someone in our family mentions a good wine they tried recently, the standard response is: “Did you detect notes of baby powder and asphalt?”
It’s an inside joke. Several years back, there was a wine connoisseur whose weekly column’s main objective was to ensure his palate would be enshrined in the pantheon of wine experts, thus rendering mere mortals weak and humble. In one column, he exalted over one wine’s complexities, including notes of baby powder and asphalt.
We gagged. What a pretentious ass.
Which brings us to P Squared, Lansing’s one and only wine bar — and, thankfully, the polar opposite of pretension. This place is about love of wine, the flow of conversation, and a little food on the side to make it all come together.
P doesn’t stand for pretension, but for the names of the two owners, Paul C. Fox and Paul Bussard, who aim to disarm customers who may not know the difference between a shiraz and a shitake mushroom. The menu arrives “pre-stained” with red wine; compliments, apparently, of a tipsy customer from the night before.
Sure, it’s a gimmick, but it’s also a signal: Kick back. Enjoy. It’s a wine bar, not a bar exam.
Granted, P Squared may try a bit too hard to put customers at ease. Its website insists “we are normal people” and “no snobs allowed.”
But I’ll take that over someone lording over you with their viticulture expertise. P Squared’s approach to customers is straightforward. Servers offer helpful and knowledgeable advice, but they don’t insist that, say, a pinot grigio from California is superior to a Michigan chardonnay. Decide for yourself over time and several visits, which is the adventure of wine-tasting.
If there is anything daunting about P Squared’s menu, it’s the torrent of wine choices. There are 94 wines and champagnes listed. (At ease, beer drinkers, there are 16 brands of brew or cider as well — most, if not all, from Michigan). I tasted 10 wines during two visits, and loved the unoaked chardonnay from Michigan’s Chateau Chantal. Just saying “unoaked chardonnay” makes me feel like that pompous wine columnist ... .
Anyway, unless you know precisely what you want, I recommend one of several wine flights — six different wines to each flight, with each flight roughly amounting to two glasses of wine. And if you’re still bollixed by the wine menu, ask for one of their pair-your-food-with-wine iPads, which can help you navigate the menu.
Hey, buddy, is this a wine column or a food column? Uh, yeah. Let’s move on.
We visited P Squared twice, both on weekday mid-afternoons. The lunch menu is scaled back considerably after 3 p.m. However, we noticed on our second visit that “Bigger Plates” were added for the hungry evening crowd.
The best by far were the tasting plates, a mix-and-match choice of cheeses and smoked meats. The one offering the most variety isn’t cheap — $28 for a total of six choices — but included are plates of olives, bread, toasted pecans with dried cranberries and warm marmalade. The 11 cheese choices range from mild gruyere to Michigan white cheddar, and there are several excellent smoked meats, including a fine prosciutto. Put all that together with a glass of wine and you have a meal, my friend.
Our dinner group was unanimous about the bread. P Squared ought to go shopping for a sturdier, more substantial bread to serve with tasting plates. The ciabatta slices didn’t do justice to the cheese, meats and olives. A good baguette, or that wonderful calabrese bread from Roma Bakery, would do the trick.
A friend also suggested the cheese and meat platter could use a bit more eye appeal, such as a sprig of fresh rosemary nestled with the slices of rosemary ham. Good idea.
On separate visits, we had mixed success with our dining choices. The lobster bisque was sub-par. They should consider starting from scratch. Several area restaurants — Soup Spoon Cafe, Troppo, English Inn — have bisques worth emulating.
The Chicken Bacon Mac was a good choice, with smoky bacon complementing three types of cheeses that are baked with macaroni. I had to send the dish back for a quick warm-up, though.
My dinner companion raved about the beef sliders: slow-roasted beef with pepperocini cheese, artichoke hearts and Roma tomatoes, sandwiched between grilled, thinly sliced panini. Agreed. This was a tasty dish, and the portion was substantial.
P Squared is a newcomer to downtown Lansing. It’s stylish without trying too hard. Black and white photos virtually pop out from red walls. On closer inspection, many of the photos are of corkscrews. Who knew corkscrews could look so artsy?
For small groups, the best seats in the house are a circle of easy chairs surrounding a small, round table. Just the place for sipping, snacking and good conversation.
And not a speck of baby powder or asphalt in sight.
Perfect for the peckish
By GABRIELLE JOHNSON
It goes without saying that P Squared has an extensive wine selection. Therefore, I won’t focus much of this effort on exploring the wine side of the menu, focusing instead on the food that plays a supporting role.
After a much-hyped grand opening a few months ago, I didn’t hear much chatter around town about P Squared — and the chatter I did hear wasn’t quite complimentary. The chief complaint was that the place is expensive — too rich for Lansing’s blood. However, I pushed any preconceived notions out of my mind when I went to meet a girlfriend for lunch. She is a state employee and dabbles in vegetarianism, so many meals are eaten downtown and she is always searching for something veggie-packed, with quality protein.
My attempt to order a club soda was rebuffed when the server informed me that P Squared only carries bottled sodas and doesn’t offer a fizzy water at all. I decided that the next best thing to do would be to rot my teeth with a Faygo Rock & Rye, which was nostalgically pleasing but didn’t last me through my meal. I was seduced by the prospect of making my own mini-sandwiches and ordered the Ploughman’s Lunch — a platter of white cheddar cheese, rosemary ham, ciabatta, mustard, apple slices, pickles, tomatoes, and cucumbers. I requested that my allotment of olives be replaced with extra apples.
The shining stars of the platter were the ham and, surprisingly, the mustard. I love a tangy, eye-watering, grainy mustard, and this one fit the bill. I slathered it onto the ciabatta and loaded it up with ham and cheese, wishing that I had a salt shaker within reach (there were none to be found.) The sad, rapidly browning apples and obviously jarred, uninspired pickles went largely ignored.
My girlfriend decided upon the Pesto Veggie Panini and a cup of chicken and wild rice soup (like I said, she only dabbles in vegetarianism). The soup was extremely thick and gelatinous. It looked unappetizing and I declined her offer of a taste. Her panini, on the other hand, was colorful and jam-packed with fresh vegetables. She loved it, proclaiming that it was “the best panini you can get downtown.”
A few weeks later, I returned for dinner with two friends. One, a fledgling sommelier, had just gotten a book about wine for Christmas and was eager to dazzle us. His wife and I sat bemused as he carefully chose what they would drink and showed us the proper way to taste. He was impressed by the selection and liked what he was drinking.
I didn’t have high hopes after studying the small dinner menu, but we decided to order a wide array of items to share. We chose a tasting plate with three items: the chipotle chicken sliders, pepperoncini roast beef sliders and chips with salsa and guacamole. I like the build-your-own tasting plate option. Diners can choose from a bevy of cheeses and a few charcuterie options, and the plates are finished with wedges of ciabatta and bowls of olives, trail mix and orange marmalade. We chose baby Swiss, gorgonzola and prosciutto, all three of which were fresh and flavorful. The trail mix was an odd addition until we struck upon the idea of slathering the bread with marmalade, then studding it with the salty nuts and cranberries. These little concoctions became table favorites.
Both of the slider varieties were fantastic. The sliders were actually bite-sized pieces of a sliced panini as opposed to most “slider” varieties that require you to unhinge your jaw in order to take a bite. The pepperoncini cheese spread that accompanied the roast beef sliders came in a ramekin for you to exercise discretion over your level of preferred spiciness. I spiced the little babies up well and loved the play between the sliced artichoke hearts, salty and crisp bread, and tender roast beef.
The chipotle chicken sliders were similarly presented, with the chipotle mayonnaise alongside. They were also well-received, and not a single slider remained at the end of our meal.
The chips/salsa/guacamole trio was the only disappointment. The guacamole was very evidently store-bought and lifeless. The fire-roasted salsa had a faintly metallic tinge to it. At least the chips weren’t stale.
Our server was knowledgeable about the wines and the food, a strength that became apparent as soon as we sat down. The former Pita Pit has been beautifully renovated, with cabernet-red walls and a lounge area. As a veteran of the downtown social scene, I would suggest a few unprecedented happy hour specials to boost their audience — maybe a $10 wine flight or $2 glasses? Let’s face it: most people don’t know or care whether they’re swilling Two-Buck Chuck or Opus One. Frankly, I had to Google the latter to make sure that I was invoking the name of something expensive.
The place was fairly empty on the weeknight, but I hope attendance picks up. P Squared offers a fine meal, if you’re feeling peckish.

$14-$20, Wine & Beer, Patio, Online Menu, WiFi, Reservations, Take-OutFebreze has become Febrez-z-z-z-z-e in a new marketing program launched this week in partnership with Shaw Media.
To promote three new scents in its Sleep Serenity Collection, the P&G brand and Shaw have created three on-demand TV channels designed to help people get a good night’s sleep.
Conceived by Starcom MediaVest Group in association with MediaCom and BCP, the program has been in development for the past six months.
Created by Shaw’s in-house production unit D71, each of the three themed channels features a 60-minute program that combines soothing music and images intended to lull viewers to sleep. Each channel reflects the three new scents in the Febreze collection: Moonlit Lavendar, Warm Milk & Honey and Quiet Jasmine. All three scents are designed for use in the bedroom.
The company worked with most of the major BDUs in the country, including sister company Shaw Communications and Rogers Cable, to get the channels in place. They are housed in the Global Television section of the on-demand menu.
“To do this on linear television would have been almost impossible, so we found different outlets on VOD to make this work,” said Errol Da-Ré, senior vice-president of sales for Shaw.
The channels are reminiscent of Swiss Chalet’s award winning Rotisserie Channel, which displayed images of rotisserie chickens 24/7 back in 2011, although its on-demand nature means that consumers must actively seek it out.
Shaw has created a series of three 15-second promo spots that are airing on its various broadcast properties, including Global Television, HGTV, Food Network Canada and Slice and between 10 p.m. and 2 a.m.
Da-Ré called VOD services an “untapped” avenue for broadcasters, and said he expects to see more activity in the space. “You’re probably going to be seeing most broadcasters starting to look at their VOD platform a lot more, because it’s another avenue for different kinds of creative,” he said. “It could house things that may be difficult to run on linear television.”
The Febreze channels are targeting women aged 25-54. They direct viewers to MySleepSerenity.ca or tweet using the hashtag #mysleepserenity to receive a complimentary sample of the new Fabreze product.Top NYC Chefs Coming Together

A very tidy compromise. That’s what I’d call the latest addition to the Peterbilt lineup. Introduced at Mid-America earlier this year, the Model 386 fills the gap between the long-nose 379 and the less traditional, but fully aerodynamic 387. Drivers and owner-ops looking for the classic long-hood styling of the 379, but with an aerodynamic edge, will find the 386 suits them to a ‘T’.
We’ve heard it’ll be very competitively priced with a long list of options, including cab-mounted exhaust, a full range of sleepers (36-, 48-, 63-, and 73-in.; double or single bunk), and two fully customizable interior packages. Powertrain options will run the gamut from traditional fleet spec to full owner-op spec, with Cat C13 and C15 engines, and Cummins ISX engines.
The 386 uses the same cab as the 379, but with a few enhancements to the basic design. The passenger door window-sill sits a couple of inches lower than before, and the passenger door porthole window is larger than ever for improved visibility. The cab itself sits 2.5 in. higher on the frame than a 379, adding that much more altitude to the view from the cab.
The sleeper on the truck I had included an upper bunk, which limited storage space to a minor extent, but it still had room for a fridge and microwave, as well as an entertainment center and plenty of room for the necessities. Right- and left-side sliding, tinted glass windows provided a decent cross-breeze when I slept with the engine off.
This truck is everything a driver would expect from Peterbilt. All the class and comfort is there, wrapped in a stylish, fuel-efficient package that comes with an attractive bonus: lower fuel costs.
The Truck
The 386 is ‘07 ready, Peterbilt says. Engineers have optimized the cooling package in preparation for the hotter-running ‘07 engines by sitting the rad in front of the front cross member rather than on top of the frame rails. The underside of the hood is smooth for improved airflow around the engine. While I can’t promise that they’ve worked out all the challenges, I can say the fan on this one ran a lot less frequently than I would have expected for the conditions. That’s a good sign.
Bobtail, the steer axle tipped the scale at 11,520 lb (with me in it). The drives were at 8580 lb. The steer axle is set back 50 in. from the bumper, keeping a lot of the cab, engine, and sleeper weight up front. I ran loaded at 78,960 lb, and with the 5th-wheel set an inch ahead of center, I scaled the drives at 33,460 lb. The steer axle went to 11,800 lb. Drivers will like the fact they can run the 5th-wheel close to center for a better ride without putting the drive axle over the limit.
The Powertrain
This truck was built for the PACLEASE rental fleet, and so had a typical fleet drive train. The 475 Cat C15 did a good job with the 79,000 lb GVW, but its full potential might have been limited by the 9-speed transmission.
Top gear is a direct 1:1 ratio with substantial steps between the gears. The truck was obviously geared to run at 60 mph, where the C15 could have run at 1325 rpm, just the way Cat says it should be run. I ran the truck at Texas speeds – between 60 and 70 – and my fuel economy took a dive. In fact, an American colleague, Steve Sturgess of roadSTAR magazine, took the same truck on a shorter ride – after Peterbilt put a roof fairing on the truck – and beat my fuel mileage by 2.2 mpg. I made 4.6 mpg on my 1000-mile trip; Sturgess hit 6.8 on his 300-mile trip.
Sturgess said he kept to 60 mph, running the engine at 1325 rpm. I ran between 65 and 70, turning the Cat up to 1425-1550 rpm. I pulled about 200 two-lane miles as well, which often forced me down into 8th gear. The spread between the gears was too great to keep the engine happy at 50 mph in top gear.
Readers shouldn’t take this as a negative comment on Cat’s fuel economy, but rather as a lesson on the need to spec for the operating conditions, and to run to the spec. Going only 200 rpm beyond the optimum speed of the engine cost me 2.2 miles per gallon.
The fairing would have helped, and perhaps his driving technique, but I believe my driving skills (speed notwithstanding) would pass muster with Cat: shift low – below 1000 rpm, easy on the pedal, low rpm in a climb, no idling, etc. I definitely wasn’t pounding on it.
On the Road
Peterbilt kindly let me have the truck for a couple of days, and I made the best of the time, spending two nights in the sleeper, and logging 998 miles. I ran in a big circle from the plant in Denton, TX, west to Odessa, south to Fort Stockton, east to Austin, and north back to Denton. In all, I covered about 200 miles of two-lane as well as the Interstate miles to see how it ran in less than ideal conditions.
Drivers will appreciate the smooth, quiet ride of this truck. It held the road well, and the 50°-wheel-cut made it a snap to wheel around tight corners. The Sheppard M100 power steering was a bit stiff for palming the wheel in a tight spot, but the feel on the highway was terrific.
The irritants were few, and minor ones to boot. For example, while there’s adequate storage space in the cab, there’s not a lot of room on top of the dash. The doors to the under-bunk jockey boxes were keyed the same as the door and the ignition, and remained locked. You’d need an extra key to get them open, or be constantly taking the key from the ignition. And last, but not least for some, the ashtray is impossible to see in the dark. A dim light down there would help a lot.
Lasting Impressions
Drivers will like the traditional Peterbilt cab, and get an extra buzz from the terrific maneuverability and visibility of the 386. Drivers in team operations will certainly appreciate the smooth ride and quiet cab. The truck appears easy to maintain, with terrific access to all the daily inspection points. The hood tilts better than 90° over and the lack of external hardware with the front disc brakes leaves lots of room between the inside of the front wheel and the frame. And here’s a plus: the new front bumper – made of an advanced composite material called Metton – is said to be nearly bulletproof.
Canadians will be happy to learn that the 386’s 49.8-in. front-axle setback keeps it comfortably under the 244-in. wheelbase limit, even with the longest sleeper Peterbilt has on the books – the 70-in. UltraCab.
As a company driver, I’d be pleased to learn that I had been assigned one of these, and as an owner-op, I’d see the advantage of running a traditional Peterbilt cab and chassis with improved aerodynamics and good weight distribution – not to mention an attractive price and an impressive list of customizing options.

Hope to see you there!Grant Traylor: Opponents from FCS have proven dangerous
HUNTINGTON -- The list from last weekend had several prominent names on it.
No. 25 Oregon State
Kansas State
South Florida
San Diego State
Connecticut
Iowa State
South Alabama
That is the list of FBS (Division I) schools who lost to FCS (Division I-AA) schools in the first week of the season.
And, if you want to include them, Georgia State, who is transitioning from FBS to FCS, also fell to Samford over the weekend.
In all, that is eight schools who thought they were starting their season with cupcakes and ended up with cake on their face at the end of college football's first weekend.
Then-No. 25 Oregon State lost a 49-45 shootout to Eastern Washington, who had been extremely successful in recent years.
That came after Kansas State, the reigning Big 12 champion, lost a 24-21 contest to North Dakota State, who had won the last two FCS championships in 2011 and 2012.
McNeese State not only beat South Florida, they whipped them to the tune of 53-21 in Tampa, Fla.
Others include Eastern Illinois' 40-19 win over San Diego State, Towson's 33-20 victory at Connecticut, Northern Iowa's 28-20 win over Iowa State and Southern Utah tripping up South Alabama 22-21.
And let's not ignore that it almost happened in the Mountain State last week as well when West Virginia had to overcome a 17-7 deficit to leave Milan Puskar Stadium with a 24-17 win over William & Mary, who was 2-9 last season.
That alone is enough reason for Marshall to not take FCS opponent Gardner-Webb lightly.
However, there is a deeper reason the Herd should especially never take an FCS opponent lightly.
That's because at one time, Marshall was that FCS opponent going into the houses of big-name teams and walking away with wins.
Remember 1998 when Marshall won its first-ever bowl game?
That season really got rolling when the Herd traveled to South Carolina and got a late field goal to earn a 24-21 win over the Gamecocks.
And how about the pinnacle season in Marshall football history -- the perfect 13-0 season in 1999?
That season started with another trip to the Palmetto State when the Herd looked Death Valley in the eyes and walked out with a 13-10 win over Clemson in the season-opener.
Marshall players are well-versed in the history of the program -- from the 1970 plane crash to the rise of the program and everything in between.
But this week's history lesson needs to be about those Marshall teams who were once the FCS team looking to make a name.
The former hunter is now the hunted.
It would be a great bit of perspective for players.
HERD OFF AND RUNNING: Marshall currently has three rushers who are in Conference USA's top 10 in rushing yards per game.
Steward Butler is tied for third with 107 yards per game, Essray Taliaferro is sixth with 89 yards per game and quarterback Rakeem Cato is 10th at 59 yards per game.
SCORING STREAK: Gardner-Webb has scored points in 56 consecutive games, which is the second-longest streak in the Big South Conference.
The last time the Runnin' Bulldogs were shut out came on Nov. 17, 2007 when they fell to Liberty 31-0 in the season finale..News

With the goal of reassuring you that they didn't all happen in the same place, and that I don't live in a crime-ridden cesspool, here's a brief history:
GRAND THEFT AUTO:
I grew up in San Diego county, and was the lucky recipient of not one, not two, but three cars stolen from me while I lived there. In fairness, two of those cars were my pop's, but I was driving them at the time they were stolen...so I take responsibility for those as cars stolen under "my" watch.
HOME INVASION/BURGLARY:
This one happened when I lived in London. When it was reported to the police, we were super excited to take advantage of the (kinda Orwellian) CCTV system that London has in place. If we're going to be watched by hundreds of thousands of secret cameras every day, then by gum...how exciting to put the system to use and catch a criminal with them! But dang it all, after watching tapes of the criminal run past like 20 cameras at the police station, darn it if the dude didn't *disappear* between two cameras. The little jerk knew where the blind spot was!
ROBBERY W/ A DEADLY WEAPON:
This one was a genuine bummer. On my third day of living in Los Angeles, my fiance, good friend and I were robbed right outside my new apartment. And from the three of us, the guys got like $17. And I know you won't believe it when I say it, but the whole thing just filled me with a tremendous amount of sadness, not rage or vengeance or anything like that. Even with the gun to my head and all...it was just a sad, sad moment. For lack of a better phrase, I was very aware of the *humanity* of the person holding the gun to my temple.
And while it sort of put a stink on my initial impression of LA, I've never had an ounce of trouble in the following 10 years... so it's been a nice place to live.
Anyway! Those are my crime stories. Nothing extraordinary, nothing particularly terrible (thank God). Just a string of unfortunate events, really.S 2015 SXSW Gaming Expo occur?
- Dates for the 2015 show are Friday, March 13 through Sunday, March 15.
- Host venue is the Palmer Events Center (900 Barton Springs Road). Easily accessible with lots of on-site parking, Palmer is located next to the Long Center (where gaming-related panel content will occur). 2014 show will sell out quickly!
What did people say about the 2014 SXSW Gaming Expo?
“Everything was bigger and better this year! SXSW Gaming has been growing steadily the last few years and each time we participate we see a bigger impact on our community reach and industry connections."
- Shelley Smith, Minicore Studios
“The Gaming Expo felt busy and crowded. The diversity in exhibitors and friendliness of volunteers made the event feel very welcoming and heightened the experience for attendees.”

Eastern red cedar (Juniperus virginiana) grows throughout the eastern half of the United States except in Maine, Florida, and a narrow strip along the Gulf Coast and at the higher elevations in the Appalachian Mountain Range. Commercial production is principally in the southern Appalachian and Cumberland Mountain regions. Another species, southern red cedar (J. silicicola), grows over a limited area in the South Atlantic and Gulf Coastal Plains. The heartwood of red cedar is bright or dull red, and the narrow sapwood is nearly white. The wood is moderately heavy, moderately low in strength, hard, and high in shock resistance, but low in stiffness. It has very low shrinkage and is dimensionally stable after drying. The texture is fine and uniform and the wood commonly has numerous small knots. Eastern red cedar heartwood is very resistant to decay. The greatest quantity of eastern red cedar is used for fence posts. Lumber is manufactured into chests, wardrobes, and closet lining. Other uses include flooring, novelties, pencils, scientific instruments and small boats. Southern red cedar is used for the same purposes. Eastern red cedar is reputed to repel moths but this claim has not been supported by research.Fall 2012 and Spring 2013 Federal Work Study

- Sections:
- Local Coverage
MANCHESTER, N.H. — An exiled Chechen rebel who met with Boston Marathon bombing mastermind Tamerlan Tsarnaev in the months before the tragedy is condemning the deadly attack and distancing himself from the perpetrators.
“I barely knew the Tsarnaev family, and only met them for the first time after we moved to the U.S.,” Musa Khadzhimuratov said in a statement handed to a Herald reporter at his Manchester apartment complex today. “During the very few encounters, which were initiated by Tsarnaev, we have never discussed political or religious issues, so I could never guess what ideas were in their minds.
“Should I have any suspicions, I would do my duty to prevent what happened at the Boston Marathon,” Khadzhimuratov wrote.
Khadzhimuratov was an aide to a Chechen separatist leader who came to the United States in 2004 as a refugee through a United Nations refugee program, the New Hampshire Union Leader reported today. FBI agents searched his home this week.
“America has become a new, beloved home for me and my family, and we appreciate the freedom and peace this country gives us,” he said. “Therefore I take it as my duty to protect my home from any treat (sic), and that is why I fully cooperate with the federal investigators.
“I understand that these guys need to do everything they can to solve this case, so they can prevent anything like this horror from happening again in the future.”
Neighbors say Khadzhimuratov, paralyzed from the waist down from a shooting in Russia 12 years ago, remains at his home. He asked for privacy.
“Me and my family are exhausted from stress and from the overwhelming media attention,” he said.Got a minute?

By glblguy
Yesterday a couple of credit card related articles showed up on Get Rich Slowly. One article was by JD himself and had a few people surprised, the other by a guest. Both articles have caused quite a bit of conversation in the comments.
As my readers know, I hate credit cards and am a strong advocate of debit cards. It seems a number of people agree with me as a recent TNS Financial Services Consumer Credit Card Program Study indicated that over 60% of consumers prefer using debit cards to credit cards as a payment vehicle, because using debit cards feels more like “real money.” Debit cards are also gaining in popularity for online purchases as well. Based on data from JupiterResearch in American Banker, debit cards will account for 46% of all online purchases by 2010, compared to 41% in 2006. The same data forecasts a decline in credit card use to 35% of all online purchases in 2010 from 41% in 2006.
You are spending your money
A debit card is directly linked to your bank account. It works very much like paying cash or like writing a check. If you want to buy something for $100, you have to have $100 in your account. When you swipe your debit card and enter your PIN to purchase something, the money is electronically deducted from your account. Depending on your bank, the transaction may or may not show up immediately, however the funds will be immediately “held” and that hold will be reflected in your available balance.
I bank with Wachovia and have found that 90% of my transactions show up in my online checking account register within a few minutes of making a purchase. The remaining 9% show up in under the “Check Card Holds” link. Very few if any don’t show up the same day.
You aren’t getting a loan every time you buy something
Let’s be honest here, when you get approved for a credit card, you are being given a card that gives you access to a line of credit, a loan. Each time you use your credit card, you are borrowing (Proverbs 22:7) money from the credit card company. Granted, if you pay off the balance in time, you don’t get charged interest but you are still borrowing money.
They are more secure
How many times have you purchased an item with a credit card, signed your receipt and the merchant never verified the signature or checked your ID? I cannot count the number of times this has happened to me. How did they know I was really the card holder? They didn’t. With a debit card, your PIN is required. To be fair, a debit card transaction can still be run as a credit card transaction and require a signature, but I have seen more and more merchants detecting the type of card you are using and automatically defaulting to a debit transaction if you are using a debit card. I think this trend will continue. Merchants prefer PIN based transactions, as it reduces their risk and costs them less in service fees.
Here are some common myths related to debit cards:
Myth: They don’t provide the same level of protection as a credit card.
Reality: Credit cards are protected by the The Fair Credit Billing Act and debit cards are not. Policies instituted by banks
do* can give you the same* similar levels of protection. While not law, I don’t expect these policies to change given the number of people migrating to debit card use. For those of you that may not know, The Fair Credit Billing Act basically means you have zero liability for fraudulent purchases, poor-quality or damaged merchandise, or for merchandise that was never delivered.
Also, debit card transactions can be disputed just like credit card transactions. In my past experience with this, I always received an immediate credit to my checking account for the amount in dispute.
Myth: Debit cards don’t provide rewards
Reality: A number of banks now offer rewards programs with their Visa card. As I said earlier, I bank with Wachovia and get rewards each time I use my debit card.
Don’t ever forget, credit card companies are in business to make money. They want you to screw up, they want you to pay only a portion of your balance, they even want you to pay your payment late or go over your credit limit. When you do these things they make money through interest, fees and even by increasing your interest rate. They won’t forgive and won’t let it slide. This is the whole reason they gave you those rewards in the first place, in hopes you would screw up.
The credit card proponents will say, “so don’t screw up”. Well, we are human, that happens once in a while. Plus, you have a whole company of people working to find ways to increase your chances of screwing up.
Life is stressful enough without adding the worries associated with a credit card. Buy things with your money from your account and don’t be servant to the lender (Proverbs 22:7) even for 30 days just to get a “free” toaster or some “cash back”. Nothing in this world is free, don’t let the credit card companies make you think otherwise.
* Since writing this article, I have changed the content based on a really good and informative discussion in the comments below. At the time of writing, I incorrectly assumed that all banks had similar policies on providing credit card “like” protection. Thanks to the information provided by a few readers, it would seem this isn’t the case. It was never my intent to misinform my readers and hopefully this will clarify the article. Thanks in particular to Justin and MITBeta for being diligent and patient while we worked through this discussion and for keeping me accurate and honest!

So, you claim it’s a Myth that debit cards don’t provide the same protection as credit cards, then go on to prove that it’s not a myth.
Just because some banks have policies similar to the credit card laws for the debit cards they issues does not mean all banks and other debit card issuers must abide by a law stating they must, or even adhere to their own policy.
Also, if your debit card linked account is emptied, according to Visa and MC, the bank has 5 days to replace the missing funds. In that time how many other payments and checks will be returned. Will the bank own up to that? Are you sure? Are you willing to bank on that?
With a credit card your money is never tied up when an issue arises, it’s the banks.
August 9th, 2007 at 12:50 pm
In response to your objections to credit cards:
I treat money spent on the credit card as spent out of my account and maintain my own system separate to the banks, so it doesn’t matter that it hasn’t actually left my account yet (since it only benefits my cash flow position).
As a non-believer I am not of the opinion that because something is in the bible it therefore applies to me (as in it may, it may not). So I don’t have a problem with an interest free loan.
Credit card use in the UK requires a pin, in exactly the same way as debit cards do, so that argument doesn’t apply. Large items (costing more than Â£100) are explicitly protected if you use a credit card but not a debit card.
We do have debit cards that provide rewards, but the interest on my current account with reward-free debit card is better than that on a current account whose debit card has rewards. Therefore it is more lucrative to take out a high reward credit card and pay off the balance in full from a high interest current account.
August 9th, 2007 at 1:01 pm
@Justin – Thanks for the reply and for offering your perspective. I don’t think I proved it isn’t a Myth at all. Policy or Law it doesn’t matter as long as it is upheld. I would challenge you to find a bank that doesn’t support these policies with their debit cards.
If your bank doesn’t, than change banks. I would also argue that if it is indeed policy than they must abide by it. Granted though can change their policy.
The bank may have 5 days, but my experience has shown the credit is almost immediate. I have had 3 fraudulent charges on my debit card over the years and in every case received immediate credit. Am I sure, no, I am sure enough, yes. Regardless, I have enough in my emergency fund to cover myself if they take longer anyway.
With a credit card, your money isn’t tied up because it’s not yours, somebody else’s money is tied up. I personally am not comfortable with that.
Sincerely, thanks again for offering your insight. I firmly believe it offers value to the readers when other thoughts and perspectives are shared.
August 9th, 2007 at 1:26 pm
Plonkee, that’s really interesting about credit cards in the UK. I didn’t know that. For me, it’s not really the bible that causes me heart burn about getting loans. I mean the bible doesn’t really say you can’t get loans, it is pretty vocal about it not being a wise thing to do. For me, it’s really more the thought of using somebody else’s money. Personally, it just bothers me, I would just rather use my own.
While I don’t support the use of credit cards, I am certainly not going to come down hard on anybody that does, AS LONG as they manage it and pay it off. Not a choice I would make, but to each his own.
Thanks for the comments, and the info on UK credit cards. Good info!
August 9th, 2007 at 1:44 pm
@glblguy: I am curious, do you have a mortgage, or are you saving up to pay cash for a house?
The one time I had to dispute a debit card transaction I had to print sign and mail a declaration. That was enough for me. Fortunately it was only an incorrect double charge, and not card number theft.
I’m failing to see why I should be held responsible and my money held hostage should my card number be compromised and the bank allow money be syphoned off. I would much rather have the bank on my side, as with a credit card theft situation, than against me, in a debit card situation. Policies change all the time, I expect they will be changing even more soon as the housing market troubles expand and banks need to figure out where to get more money.
August 9th, 2007 at 2:19 pm
Regrettably, we have a mortgage. Once it’s paid off though, we’ll pay cash if we do decide to get another home. That’s a LONG way off though. I am focusing on getting my credit card debt payed off first, then I will tackle the mortgage.
As for the bank on your side, I think they are. The problem is with the “bad apples” that report fraud when there isn’t. The bank credits them back, they pull the money out and the bank is out $x on a transaction that was claimed fraud that wasn’t.
I agree on policy changes and potential coming changes. If they change, than I’ll change my behavior. Just have to roll with the punches. I’m cool using cash, I just find using a debit card is easier to track.
August 9th, 2007 at 2:45 pm
Great article! I completely agree with you about not using credit cards. My husband and I are in the process of paying off our debt (Dave Ramsey style) and it is such a long road. Looking back I can’t even remember most of what the credit cards were spent on…and the rewards certainly weren’t worth what we’re paying on interest! One comment on debit cards and pins, I’ve noticed that many places, like fast food restaurants, aren’t requiring pin numbers anymore. However I don’t know if that is a common trend or just incompetent employees. Anyway, great site keep it up!
August 9th, 2007 at 3:23 pm
Thanks Jessy, and really glad you like the site.
Trust me, I know exactly what you are saying. I saw a great quote on another blog the other day, something along the lines of she had a lot more debt than stuff, so she wasn’t sure how in the heck she spent so much :-) I know exactly what she means.
Well, they run it as a credit transaction, and I think Visa doesn’t require signatures on purchases below $25 (the exact dollar amount might be wrong). Regardless of how they run it, it is still coming out of your bank account. Are they making you sign?
August 9th, 2007 at 3:33 pm
It sounds to me that the people railing against credit cards are the ones that weren’t able to manage them in the first place. No offence intended.
While credit cards may not work for you and your situation, that doesn’t mean they don’t have a use or a place in many people’s finances. They offer protections written into law (US law), and provide me with about $1000 in rewards annually.
August 9th, 2007 at 4:57 pm
Hi Justin. Well to some extent I think you’re right. Although I am not sure we’re against credit cards because we couldn’t manage them but rather because we experienced the big mess you can run when something goes wrong. Maybe this is the same in many respects. But I would agree your right. Having a pit bull may seem like a great thing, right up to the point you get bit ;-)
Justin, if they work for you that’s great, but you’ll never hear me advise that anyone get one. This is a personal finance site, and just goes to prove that a lot of financial decisions are indeed personal.
Hope you continue to visit and we can respect each others difference of opinions. To each his own. I really believe that.
August 9th, 2007 at 7:36 pm
I feel I have been respectful while voicing a differing opinion and have added your site to my rss aggregator. I expect to comment again.
Thanks
August 9th, 2007 at 9:00 pm
Justin, I completely agree. Thanks for the RSS add and look forward to your input and perspective.
August 9th, 2007 at 10:31 pm
The decision to use a debit card or credit card is a very personal choice. It very much depends on YOU and YOUR situation.
For a person who is in complete disciplined control of their finances then I would say you can find credit cards that benefit you more than debit cards. Credit card companies make a lot of money on the people who are not financially disciplined or responsible. This means they are able/willing to offer better incentives (rewards, float, protection, etc) to get your business. It is a numbers game for them so you shouldn’t feel at all guilty if you are taking a “free ride”. This is built into the business model and rules they created for this game.
Larry, you are right however about debit cards feel more like real cash. So how can you do this with a credit card? Well, what if each and every night you transferred the exact amount of money you spent on the credit card into your high yield INGDirect emergency fund account. That way you are very in tune with its affect on your bottom line but at the same time you get the protection of the credit card and the financial benefit of float interest. However, the key concept here is financial discipline.
However, my impression is that MOST people (even if they have the knowledge) do not have the financial disciple to keep themselves out of trouble. For those people the debit card is probably the better choice. Going from irresponsible use of credit cards to the built-in discipline of debit cards is a very valid step in a personÂ’s journey to financial freedom. It can be a very powerful technique to break poor credit card habits. Then, over time with new habits, a person may have matured to the point that they can use credit in a beneficial way.
The proper use of credit should not be dismissed in your journey to financial success. In fact, using credit after you fully understand it and are disciplined enough to control it is a SMART move. However, using credit when you are not ready or able to handle it can be a disaster.
The comments on this post are great. The differences in opinion are simply a matter of perspective based on where the author is in this journey.
So, Are Debit Cards Are Better Than Credit Cards?
The correct answer depends on YOU.
August 10th, 2007 at 11:21 am
@RobY – Wow Rob, you need a blog ;-) I agree it’s a personal choice, but as I told Justin you won’t get me to advise using credit cards to anybody, regardless of their situation.
You can certainly make a credit card “feel” like cash, but regardless your paying with whatever you are buying with a loan.
You are right though, it most people’s hands, credit cards are very dangerous…trust me, “My name is glblguy, and I do stupid things with credit cards…” :-)
As for credit being a SMART move, not sure I agree. I think anytime you put yourself in the situation of owing somebody else something based on your expectation of being able to pay it off is a slippery slope.
Credit cards aren’t bad, they just allow people to make really stupid mistakes. Now, I do think most credit card companies are bad, but that’s another story…
August 11th, 2007 at 10:38 am
Interesting discussion — I have a number of comments:
@glblguy: “As for the bank on your side, I think they are. The problem is with the Â“bad applesÂ” that report fraud when there isnÂ’t. The bank credits them back, they pull the money out and the bank is out $x on a transaction that was claimed fraud that wasnÂ’t.”
Make no mistake, the bank is NEVER out money on credit or debit transactions. I worked for an online store at one point and whenever a chargeback occurred, the money came right out of the merchant’s account and the onus was on us to prove that the transaction was legitimate. This is difficult to do in the online world since we have no signature to use as proof. If we do have some kind of proof, the chargeback gets reversed and the customer ends up paying, but the bank NEVER has to pay.
I currently am a debit card user, mainly because as RobY pointed out, that is the part of the journey that I am on, having paid off my credit card debts and learned to spend (less than…) what I have, not what I will have.
However, after much thought, introspection, and planning, I have recently come around to the idea of using credit cards again as a tool to accomplish the following:
1. Protect myself against fraud and mistakes. I don’t want someone to be able to clean out my checking account. Luckily I have a separate checking account specifically for “discretionary” spending. The BillPay on my primary account pays all of my periodic fixed expenses. So what’s left (after I pay myself, of course) goes into the discretionary checking account. There is never that much money there, so there’s no a lot to get. But after some recent fraudulent uses of my debit cards, I am more concerned about the implications of having a debit card. Yes, the bank issued a “provisional” credit to my account, but only after I mailed in a detailed, notarized affidavit explaining the situation. That’s a lot of work and time to get MY MONEY back. Luckily the charges weren’t that high, and I have enough of a reserve to be able to handle little bumps, but things could have been worse. (And yes, I am changing banks.)
2. Rewards: I have a 7 month old daughter and there is no time to think about paying for college like the present. I can’t yet afford to put much, if any, money away for her education since my retirement takes precedence, but if I could get free money simply for paying my bills will a credit card that I could put towards her 529 plan, I would be foolish not to.
3. Float: I have no problem using the credit card company for a short term loan. Put all of my monthly payments on the credit card and let the money sit in my high interest money market account for 1-30 extra days. The credit card companies have earned enough interest off of me over the years, I think a little payback is in order.
The cardinal rule of living within your means is: Don’t buy things for which you don’t have the money. If I use a credit card to accomplish to above 3 items, I will still have the money in my bank account. I won’t be spending money I don’t have, it will just be in a more roundabout way.
August 11th, 2007 at 12:38 pm
MITBeta, thanks for the correction, but technically we are both wrong and right. Transactions less than $50 the banks generally just write off. It’s not worth the trouble to follow through on them. For more than $50, you’re correct the person that processed the transaction is responsible. I forgot about this little rule when I wrote the article. I work for a bank, should have remembered.
Good points, and a nice example of how credit cards can be used as tools.
October 8th, 2007 at 12:46 am
I am anti-credit card as well. I think you made a good point on debit cards. I receive rewards on my card (not a lot but some) and each time I use my debit card, a portion goes to local schools. I know people who have received a lot of better rewards including a free airline ticket and cash deposits into their bank account for using their debit cards.
It seems everytime I’m at a store, people are paying with their bank card vs. a credit card. I think the more people turn to debit cards, the more protections will be enacted. I have heard that if you use the credit option of the debit card, you have the protection as if it was a regular credit card. This I’m not sure about but I think I’ve heard that somewhere just recently.
October 9th, 2007 at 8:42 am
Great points Siena. To be honest, I am not sure on the same protections or not. Seems to an area that is a little fuzzy, maybe somebody else can shed some light on this.
October 9th, 2007 at 8:54 am
Each bank is different in what protections it offers to its debit card users. There is no general law as is the case with credit cards. So individuals need to ask their banks or read all of the fine print that comes with a new account to determine what their banks policies are in this regard. Personally, I have yet to see any bank offer as good of protection as the credit card companies do, although some come close. Also, when you dispute a credit card change, you’re not out any money, whereas if someone gets your debit card number and goes on a spending spree, you might eventually get that money back, but in the mean time, good luck paying the mortgage.
October 9th, 2007 at 11:05 am
@MITBeta: Exactly! If your credit card is compromised you are NEVER out any money. If your debit card is compromised you can be bouncing bill payments all over the place once your account and overdraft protection (savings acct or credit acct) get wiped clean. Then you have a mess to clean up with the utilities, the mortgage company, etc.

Hi Nina, thank you and glad you like my blog!
January 11th, 2008 at 12:18 pm
I’m sorry, but I know from experience that banks do not offer the same protection. I’ve had my credit card info and debit card info stolen before. The credit card companies reported it and refunded my money.
The bank on the other hand said it was out of their hands and can’t keep up with every purchase.
Never used a debit card again
January 11th, 2008 at 2:06 pm
Hi Chris, your statement is a little too general. The level of protection is dependent on the bank and the banks policies. Sounds like your bank didn’t have a good set of these.
I recently had my debit card stolen and my bank refunded me all of my money and worked with the merchants.
Please don’t let a bad experience with one bank tarnish your whole view of debit cards.
Thanks for stopping by and for taking the time to comment.
January 11th, 2008 at 2:14 pm
Chris’s experience is one of the major reasons I prefer to use a CC, the protections are mandated and not just policies than can be changed with 6 point type at the back of a new privacy statement.
January 11th, 2008 at 2:21 pm
Glblguy: You stated in your initial post that the protections on debit cards are equal to the protections on credit cards. This is simply not true, and you’ve had a number of people prove you wrong in the comments, yet you cling to your assertion that debit cards are better than credit cards.
By the way, since your initial post I have made approximately $500 in interest on a 1yr 0% APR credit card float, plus another $250 in rewards cash. I still have 6 months of 0% APR on my rewards card, and I fully intend that by the end of that period I’ll have $30,000 sitting in my high interest savings account earning $200/month in interest on the bank’s dime. Try doing that with a debit card.
January 11th, 2008 at 3:18 pm
@MITBeta – The reason I “cling” is not due to the protections. In my instance with my bank, I would argue the protections are equal, just not mandated. Sure,maybe the bank won’t honor them, but that is a risk I am willing to take. In my recent experience having my card stolen and card used, the bank refunded all of money within 48 hours.
I cling because I don’t trust credit card companies and I don’t like borrowing money, if even for 30 days. If you are comfortable using credit cards, that is a personal choice you’ve made that I respect. I don’t feel that is the right choice for me, and hence why I voice my opinions about them on this blog. For me debit cards are better than credit cards…but better is a very subjective word. What is better for me, may not be better for you right?
I think that’s great you’ve made that much money, but if you play with fire, you’re bound to get burnt. I think this all boils down to personal feelings and comfort. I’ve been burned by credit card companies, and have chosen to not let that happen again.
January 11th, 2008 at 3:24 pm
Your opinion is fine, but you state:
“Reality: Credit cards are protected by the The Fair Credit Billing Act and debit cards are not. Policies instituted by banks do give you the same levels of protection.”
This is simply not true.
January 11th, 2008 at 5:30 pm
MITBeta – Ok, I agree. I made some changes to the article and added a note at the end. See what you think.

More fuel on the fire:
May 1st, 2008 at 2:51 pm
I personally like that debit cards are great for people who are habitual spenders because you can only spend what’s in your bank account rather than racking up huge credit debt. I do have concerns however about their security because if someone intercepts the card number they can withdraw staright from your account. Whilst you’ll get the money back if you’re a vicitm of fraud, it’s very time consuming
May 1st, 2008 at 3:04 pm
Make Friends dude, no, you can’t only spend what’s in your bank account. The bank will allow you to spend more than what is in your account and then will charge you fees for the privilege, for EVERY CHARGE over the balance. It’s easy to rack up hundreds of dollars in fees for $1, $2, $5 purchases made on your debit card this way.

I myself agree that debit cards are better than credit cards, and that it is true in the book of Proverbs in the New King James Version of the Bible: Wealth gained by dishonesty will be diminished, but he who gathers by labor will increase.
November 21st, 2013 at 9:24 am
I doubt very seriously that there is any debit card out there that is giving the amount of reward points I get with my Chase Sapphire card. Also, I do pay my bill every month and I do not really have any trouble remembering to do that.

At first glance $80 for a smartphone doesn’t really seem like that amazing of a deal. Especially when you consider that is has a smaller screen, less processing power, and fewer megapixels in the camera. But, when you consider that this is the price for the phone without any type of contract it becomes a little bit more interesting.
The phone is the Android powered IDEOS from the Chinese company Huawei. It was released earlier this year in Kenya and has already been bought by 350,000+ Kenyans. In an area of the world that is stricken by poverty, this device is bringing the wonders of the smartphone to people who could never have afforded such a luxury in the past.
In comparison to the major smartphones on the market right now, namely the iPhone4, DroidX2, and Blackberry Bold, it does not have the same level of technology. The screen is relatively small, though larger than the screen on the Blackberry Bold. The RAM is half of that of the major smartphones, and the battery life is worse as well.
However, when you consider the cost it is incredibly reasonable. The IDEOS sells for about $80 with no contract, compared to the iPhone4 at $800, the DroidX2 at $700, and the Blackberry Bold at $600 without a contract. That means you can get a phone for 85-90% less than the big boys.
It is also uses the Android OS which means that the sky is limit with 300,000+ apps. The open source software makes it possible for apps to be developed in developing countries in ways that would never be possible with Apple or Blackberry’s stringent requirements. This makes these cheap phones even more useful in these poor countries.
Apps are being developed to help farmers better market their products, and even track diseases that can destroy farming which is a huge part of most African nation’s economies.
In the sphere of this blog, I have already written about all kinds of apps and gadgets being developed specifically with Africa in mind. This phone makes those devices that much more useful. One of the most exciting of these is Medkenya which is essentially the same as WebMD here in the states. It provides information and resources to people that would never have had them in the past.
By encouraging the rapid spread of smartphone usage in Africa it is not unreasonable to think more apps could be developed to help prevent the spread of infectious diseases or maybe even an HIV-testing peripheral that would do wonders to help slow the spread of that terrible disease.
We already take a lot of technology for granted in the US, and that is understandable. We use our phones for games, and news, and sports scores, and even to buy our coffee at Starbucks now. The difference for the people in these developing countries is that his technology can save their lives quite literally by providing medical assistance at a level they never would have had without smartphones. This idea is summed up quite well by Dr. Bitange Ndemo, Kenya’s Minister of Information and Communication:.
Personally, I have never seen a cell phone as a necessity despite the fact that I have one and really value all of the features that it gives me. The difference is that I live somewhere with plenty of doctors and hospitals, and everything else I could ever want. These inexpensive cellphones are providing an improvement in the quality of life for these people that would otherwise take decades more of development.GYMPIE woman and union leader Dolly Jensen has returned from Melbourne after attending the Finance Sector Union's National Conference.

As a double bonus, Ms Jensen was also in the company of her hero, Sally McManus, who spoke to the conference about laws broken for employees and the ACTU fight to change the rules.
At the conference, the FSU endorsed its support of a campaign close to Ms Jensen's heart, the We Won't Wait campaign, to have 10 days domestic violence leave added to the National Employment Standard.
Ms Jensen has now left banking, and this was her last conference.
She said she was was honoured and humbled to accept a boxed bottle of wine from the National Enterprise Committee Presidents, and a motion was passed that read:
"FSU Conference 2017 recognises the tireless work and contribution of Dolly Jensen. On behalf of our FSU members, in particular, ANZ members as the ANZ National Enterprise President, we acknowledge Dolly has shown great strength and courage during her time as a leader of this union and we wish her well for the future.”
Ms Jensen will stay on as ANZ national president until she finds a successor.

A goal down in that game, Harry Redknapp's side secured the points at the Britannia Stadium thanks to a brace - including one spectacular strike - from Gareth.
Tottenham made the breakthrough in the 20th minute with Bale at the heart of things. The Wales full-back cracked in a shot that was blocked by goalkeeper Thomas Sorensen.
Peter Crouch was first to react but his effort came back off Ryan Shawcross. However, to the Stoke skipper's horror, his clearance went straight to Bale who headed home.
Stoke drew level in the 25th minute with Tottenham guilty of poor defending. Younes Kaboul directed Matthew Etherington's corner into the area and Fuller.

Small friendly hotel in the quiet seaside resort of Fregene close to Rome Fiumicino airport
On our first trip to Italy in 1999 we booked a room at Hotel Golden Beach as an overnight stop so that we could recover from our long flight before driving up to Tuscany and our rented house. We were pleasantly suprised at its location in the small seaside resort of Fregene, situated in the middle of an area of private villas and narrow lanes, bordered with an abundance of trees and flowers.
The hotel is pure 1960's vintage, furnished in original style, and does show signs of its age. But it is spotlessly clean and Anna Maria, who speaks excellent English, and her staff, could not be more friendly or helpful. The restaurant offers wonderful local food and you can dine inside or outside in the attractive gardens.
We returned in October 2004 and discovered that the hotel was still as good as we remembered, and of course it was wonderful to be greeted as old friends by Anna Maria.
Hotel Golden Beach is very close to Fiumicino aiport which you can reach in about 30 minutes, driving on small back roads and we love this aspect - as coping with freeway traffic in a strange country after a long tiring flight can be very stressfull.
Probably the only down side to the hotel are the groups of students that occasionally stay there who can be a little noisy, but Anna Maria always informs you about this, and will put you in a room well away from them if you still decide to stay.
Finally, the cost of staying at the hotel is very reasonable (95 euros for a doubleCatherine, Duchess of Cambridge's flying lessons

Posted on 02/06/2014 8:46:58 PM PST by jfd1776
Aaron Burr, Patriot and Vice President
On February 6, 1756, a boy was born into privilege in Newark, New Jersey. Young Aaron Burr, Jr. was son of the president of the College of New Jersey, and grandson of Jonathan Edwards, the Calvinist theologian regarded as a leader of the evangelical movement of the 18th century, an equal to the great preacher George Whitfield.
Privilege then wasnt quite what privilege is today, of course; there were no Rolls-Royces to drive, no Waldorf Astorias to stay in during constant vacations, no jet-setting to Monte Carlo, no celebrity photographers and magazines to put ones face in front of every shopper to keep their stars shining. But to the extent that there was privilege, young Burr had it.
He lost his famous grandfather and both of his parents when he was just a baby, so this child of Princeton University and the Great Awakening had not only fame on his side, but pity for his orphan status as well. All America knew who he was everyone that mattered, anyway and he was sure to succeed in life because of this background.
Aaron Burr attended the family college at 13, joined the American Whig Society and Cliosophic Society, and received his B.A. in 1772, at the age of 16. He joined the Continental Army as soon as the War of Independence began in 1775, and served under Generals Montgomery, Putnam, and Malcolm. He was even a member of General Washingtons personal staff very briefly but disliked that role so much he quit in a matter of weeks.
Still, Burrs military service was honorable, distinguished, and long enough, ranging from 1775 through 1779, the lions share of the war, if not the whole thing. He went into the practice of law, and then politics, which is of course why we know him today.
Aaron Burr served as Attorney General of New York, then as a U.S. Senator from New York, and finally, amazingly, as Vice President of the United States, during President Thomas Jeffersons first term, a reward for his brilliant skills as a New York state party-builder.
In the complex election of 1800, Aaron Burr very nearly became the President himself, during the weeks of unsure wrangling in the House of Representatives that resulted from the famous tie in the Electoral College.
Rising to Vice President at 44. The very image of success. But his fall was to be great as well, since during that very term of office, he was to challenge Alexander Hamilton to a duel, causing a collapse in his political capital so complete that he would become virtually unemployable, spending the rest of his long life grasping at ever more desperate straws to survive.
Ronald Wilson Reagan, Actor and President
On February 6, 1911, more than a century after Aaron Burrs precipitous fall, a baby was born in the tiny town of Tampico, Illinois. Ronald Wilson Reagan was born poor, the son of a good man with a poor work ethic and an addiction to alcohol. Reagans parents were no mansion-dwellers; they rented houses and apartments in small towns and large from Tampico to Chicago to Dixon as his dad struggled to hold down jobs as a shoe salesman and his mom struggled to feed the family on such meager earnings.
Still, his poor parents managed to raise him right; Reagan was raised in the evangelical Disciples of Christ church that his mom considered a second home, and he attended tiny Eureka College in Quincy, Illinois. Eureka was and is no Princeton; this small town college along the Mississippi is as far from the Ivy League as you can get. It doesnt attract the wealthy or the famous, but Reagan always attributed his success in life to his mothers church and to the small town college where he studied economics, played football, and trod the boards of the college stage.
He gained early fame on Midwest radio, working in WHO in Des Moines as the voice of the Cubs. He moved to Hollywood in 1937 and soon became a dependable actor in the small budget assembly line films of the era, gaining the nickname of the Errol Flynn of the Bs. While a fine actor, his greatest talents lay elsewhere, so he moved on to leadership of the Screen Actors Guild, work as a television host, then a traveling pitchman for General Electric, and eventually, finally, politics.
While Ronald Reagan had been a serious and vocal opponent of communism throughout his career, he didnt actually enter politics until the age of 53, when he delivered a famous speech in support of Barry Goldwaters 1964 presidential campaign. This propelled him to his own elections in 1966 and 1970 as governor of California, the leadership of the conservative movement in the 1970s, and finally, his own amazingly successful two-term presidency in the 1980s that won the Cold War, saved the economy, and reawakened Americas almost-forgotten respect for the vision and philosophy of our Founding Fathers.
A Study in Contrasts
At this point, Gentle Reader, you may be wondering why the author thought to put these two historical figures together in a column. They shared a birthday; Burr was a privileged orphan while Reagan came from an intact but impoverished family. Both reached the top of American politics but so have many others. Why look at the two of them together? What is the lesson? Consider this:
Aaron Burr was an anachronism. There is a reason why the election of 1800 took months to resolve, and there is a reason why Burr finally challenged Alexander Hamilton to the duel that took the former Treasury Secretarys life.
Aaron Burr was a politician a VERY modern politician in an era in which there were no politicians. Burr was a master at organizing disparate interests, at sweet-talking an audience to his side. He was a charmer in person, on the stump, in a political caucus or town meeting. He cared about his audience; he wanted the best for them. This wasnt faked; he genuinely wanted the best for them.
But in an era of philosophers, Burr seemingly had no philosophy. Its not that he was incapable of choosing sides, or supporting the United States; he was an early volunteer in the War of Independence, and served long and well. But he had no interest in the great questions of political philosophy. At a time when virtually everyone in politics was a deep thinker, Burr was as shallow as the next poll.
Burr was happy to side with the Federalists; he was equally happy to side with the Jeffersonians. Whichever side wanted him on their ticket, he would be open to their offer. Nobody knew where he stood on any issue; he could give a speech without pinning himself down. Burr wasnt just an independent, or moderate, he was a mover and shaker, a leader, without an issue on which to lead.
From the viewpoint of modern onlookers, this may not seem so strange; the Federalists and the Jeffersonians look nearly identical to our modern eyes; they would ALL be conservative Republicans today.
But to them, their differences were real, and serious enough to matter. In the election of 1800, Adams was clearly a Federalist, and Jefferson was clearly a Jeffersonian. But Burr could go either way, and would clearly be happy to accept eithers nomination to office, anytime. There was something very wrong about that, terrifying to anyone who was paying attention.
Hamilton's Analysis
Alexander Hamilton made it his personal quest to destroy the infection of Aaron Burr in our politics. From at least the baffling House wrangling of 1800 forward, Hamilton told everyone he could to watch out for Burr. Hamilton maintained that this nation could only succeed if its politicians ALL its politicians cared about liberty.
In Hamiltons view, disagreements on the finer points the relative strength of the Senate vs. the House, just how much authority the Senates advice and consent power was meant to hold over the executive branch, and so forth were minor in comparison to the greater risk of electing politicians like Burr, who thought of elections before philosophy who thought that being a caring and honorable person was sufficient, satisfied to leave the questions of philosophy to others.
Hamiltons constant attacks on the Burr Problem this risk of political success coming without philosophical conviction were the catalyst to the final challenge that resulted in the Interview at Weehawken that ended Hamiltons life and Burrs career.
If you could ask him, Alexander Hamilton would say it was worth it.
The Return of Federalism
Now, Ronald W. Reagan, on the other hand, was the opposite of Aaron Burr in every way. In an era of politicians who put glad-handing and poll results ahead of philosophical concerns, Reagan was a champion of the philosophical underpinnings of the American experiment.
Reagan appeared on the scene like a skyrocket, in October of 1964, with a powerful, televised speech about the issues of the day entitled A Time for Choosing. The Speech was chock full of data, statistics, explanations of the Founders philosophy and the current political class many failings. It was a love letter to Austrian economics and the limited government view that our Framers designed for us. There wasnt a feint to the center or a dodge from the issues anywhere to be found, in that speech or any other in his thirty-year political career.
The Democrats never knew what to do about Reagan. They tried to portray him as a genial, grandfatherly type, successful because he was sweet and lovable. The Democrats called him Teflon, in a largely successful effort to convince the uninformed that Reagan never talked about issues, that serious matters never stuck to him, that his popularity was in spite of his conservatism, not because of it.
But nothing could be further from the truth. Reagan was a wonks wonk; after years as an actor, his old training as an economist had finally returned to the front, and he immersed himself in data. Reagan loved being able to not just state what was right, but back it up with practical data from unimpeachable sources.
Ronald Reagan proved many things to an America that had grown nihilistic about its politics. Many didnt care, but worse, many who did care had given up. You shake your fist, writer your letters to the editor, walk enough precincts and hold enough rallies, and you get disheartened when even all that fails to awaken the sheeple to the dangers of our current path.
But Ronald Reagan showed that the people COULD be awakened. His back-to-back successes in liberal California, followed by back-to-back landslides as president, proved that the Bob Michaels and Richard Nixons of the world, those dull leaders who thought the people could never again be enthused about policy, so why bother, were simply wrong. This nation CAN still be enthused by concrete issues, by great thoughts, by a return to advocacy of the philosophy of our Founders.
Read a Ronald Reagan speech not just the drafts that came from the writing team, purged by bureaucrats of their meat, but the version he actually delivered, after Reagan reinserted his statistics and his firm stands and you see that this was a statesman, unafraid to take a stand on the issues of the day.
Reagan was famous for his debates, both the presidential campaign debates of the run-ups to elections, and the issues debates on matters like the Panama Canal Treaty. If he could educate the public with a letter, a radio spot, a speech, or a debate, hed never shrink from the opportunity.
And as a result, we have a whole movement of conservatives who came of age in the Reagan Era, who learned at his feet both what our Founding Fathers intended for us, and how to apply it today.
Aaron Burr and Ronald Reagan, a study in contrasts. Both men who served their nation, cared about their constituents, always had the best of intentions. But as we see from their legacies, and their lists of accomplishments, only Reagan truly succeeded. Burrs heirs are the thousands of politicians, those who gauge their votes by how the wind blows, who fear live interviews and run from controversy. They blend together in the memory like interchangeable parts, political functionaries who do as theyre told by their party leaders without thought or understanding.
But Ronald Reagan was a statesman, in the tradition of the greatest of our Founding Fathers. He appreciated their vision, and showed us that their methods could still pave the way to success, even today. His love of the American thesis was infectious; when America watched him, we joined his excitement about all that it meant to be part of the American Experiment, even now, two centuries after the Founding Era.
Aaron Burr was just the first of many famous names to debase national public service with crass politics; Ronald Reagan was a return to the ways of old. He would have been at home in Philadelphia, in the summer of 1787. He would have been at home in the halls of Congress, in those early years of the new nation.
When all Washington DC was populated by Burrs and worse, Ronald Reagan was a patriot. Even today, in our long political and economic depression, we thank Providence for giving us Ronald Reagan as a reminder, and as an example to emulate.
Happy Birthday in Heaven, President Reagan!

“A Time for Choosing” by Ronald Reagan
I made the occasion to travel to Tampico, IL just to visit the site of Reagan's birth, one year after his death and after visiting the Ronald Reagan Library two months after his death.
What a contrast in those two places.
For those fortunate to visit the Reagan Library, it is beautiful and tastefully done.
Tampico, IL is one of many such tiny towns in middle America, maybe three blocks long, you're out of it before you think you've begun. I drove back and forth three times before realizing that the tiny little store front with a couple of little American flags in the window, was the first floor of the spot where Ronald Wilson Reagan began his life on earth!
I was shocked that so little money had been spent on the site. I thought how much had gone into the Library and how forgotten his actual home seemed but that's what is so wonderful, looking back now.
The insignificant spot, like so many others around America, are not what make people who they are or who they become. That never during President Reagan's life, did he feel the need to be other than who he was, a poor boy from a small town, living in rented, dusty rooms over a storefront, is a testament to who he was.
Happy Birthday Ronnie!
Thanks very much!
I too have seen the house in Tampico... You’re right, there’s not much to it... though they do have some events there...
About an hour or so north though, there’s the town of Dixon, where Reagan spent a number of years growing up. That house is more fully available as an opportunity to tour, so I would recommend it if you can ever get to Dixon!
Eureka College is in Eureka, Illinois, near Peoria, not Quincy.
Aaron Burr was hardly an honorable man. He tried to steal the Presidency from Jefferson in 1800.
I felt that I would benefit from being there and I was, as I stated.

It has a walking tour which features more cast-iron front buildings than in Chicago, the second largest collection in Kentucky, and Battle Grove Cemetery, believed to have the second oldest Confederate monument in the U.S. Cynthiana also features a driving tour. Maps for both tours are available at the Harrison County Chamber of Commerce, 117 Court Street, M-F 9-4, 606/234-5236.
Two Civil War battles were fought in Cynthiana. The first, at Licking Creek on July 17, 1862, was part of Gen. John Hunt Morgan's "First Kentucky Raid." The Federal force of 500 soldiers was defeated by Morgan's 800 Confederate soldiers and Cynthiana was captured. The Battle of Cynthiana took place on June 11-12, 1864 and consisted of three separate battles in which the Confederates were defeated, thus ending Morgan's last raid into Kentucky. Civil War artifacts can be found in the collections at the Cynthiana-Harrison County Museum (F-Sat 10-5, 13 South Walnut, 606/234-1053, not handicapped accessible).
A monument commemorating the Battle of Cynthiana was erected in 1869 and is located in Battle Grove Cemetery.
An annual re-enactment of The Battle of Cynthiana, 1862 is held in July. For more information, contact the Harrison Chamber of Commerce (606)234-5236.

Yes, that is a real dragon, genetically engineered in Bethesda's bio-vaults, where a series of iterative experiments from Bethesda's top mad scientists yielded a creature that could land dramatically in front of heroes and roar at them without actually attacking or hurting anybody.

Now this is time for free your mind and your soul
Yo our official story has never been told
Ladies you got to demand what you want
And what we want is respect, right
Yo listen up on the track here
'cause you'll also have to deal with it right
Freedom every time for the sisters
Check this watch this
A here we go now
Listen if I'm poompa moo
I'll be the ruler like slick rick
Get with this quick witted
Adidas-wearing chick
Poppa got a brand new bag
Momma got a brand new jag
A gold tag I ain't no old hag
I represent not only in the kitchen
And the bedroom room
But also in the board room
So give me more room
Deny my opportunity
You in jeopardy
Yo-yo set me free
Don't hinder me
Let me be
My fightin' for freedom
I got the heat in case you need 'em
I'm a straight soldier
Ain't nobody told you
Hold up on them lies
I know your games and your plans
Do whatever you can to oppress demand
But when it's time to drop the bomb
Bring the funk and it's on
You say you never met a sister so strong
You're wrong now how can we be free
It takes you and it takes me
To blend together in harmony
And peace and love and all of the above
Sisters coming together representing one love
No disrespect but we gotta get it together
No matter what's the weather
Sisters gotta stick together
If sisters be stronger
Don't let 'em steer you wrong
Hold on 'cause sisters got it going on
Yeah
Chorus:
Let's free your mind and your soul
Don't let no guys go and take control
Because you're young and a you play the role
And our official story has never been told
Whoever said these are the things that you can do
And the things you ain't supposed to
So am I further when I think I'm getting closer
That's when I tend to think of rosa how was it
Took a seat to make a stand
But now in standing we've gotten more demanding
They never thought in planning
That a wish for us to sit would be a dose of
This fucking rollercoaster
Whether tradition or religion
Why you question my decision
Why you spend up all your time trying to
Get into my mind
Why everybody and they mama
Gots to add to all my drama mad drama
Hell if i'ma keep my dominating feministic hell
Creating crazysexycool black ass
In the palms of your player hater's stands
My only chance of being free is to fly within me
And it's illegal to kill a fucking eagle
A bird is never more important than my people
I guess we didn't need him so I took away his freedom
Chorus
My spiritual awareness leads me to believe
That you doubt in the sisters
That come with the peace we've been together
Since God created all of thee
African daughters celebration is in order
Pop the cork and give the champagne to the stork
That brought the lyte to my momma in new york
African I come again and again
You kick me down I get back up
I'm coming back in multiples of ten
You know where I come from
Slung from the belly of the beast
Used to speak african tongue
So I showed her next one bolder
Slung the devil over my shoulder
I'm getting over 'cause I'm bolder than the next
I'm enlightened 'cause I speak the real truth from the text
Who's next to flex with this s-i-s-t-e-r
The sun the moon the crest and the star
Wanna see how open you are
Chorus
Come and take a walk with me
Closer walk with thee
See what only I can see
Nobody knows the trouble I've seen
So it's back to the womb of everlasting life
And truth let the heaven of a
Sister embrace you and praise them other gods
Come into the light let it shine blackness is fine
The blackness of your skin
The blackness of your mind
I am who I am and that's who I be
And I don't give a damn if your eyes can't see
If you can't see what I can see
That you're blind baby bop
I'm a woman who's black so back up back up
'cause it's on i'ma tell you strong what's wrong
With the world that we're living on
It ain't who you know it ain't what you drive
It's about how you feel about yourself
On the inside when your self-esteem is low
And they call you a ho then they think you's a ho
But that ain't what the lord God made you to be
I need you to see you're black and you're free

Chorus6 Infamous Feuds That Almost Derailed Classic Movies
Many passive film viewers don’t understand that making a movie is an intense collaborative experience. It’s easy to say that…
Many passive film viewers don’t understand that making a movie is an intense collaborative experience. It’s easy to say that a movie belongs to a certain director or star, when in reality no film would exist without the efforts of hundreds – sometimes thousands – of people. In order to create something worth viewing, each and every one of these crew members – from director to gaffer – has to share responsibility in some way with those around them.
What we don’t often consider is that a film set is just like any old office: full of people that don’t always get along. But who cares if the focus puller gets into a tussle with the best boy? Most people don’t even know what a focus puller is. If you’re a below-the-line crew member on a film set, you basically just keep your head down and do as you’re told by the heads of your respective departments. If you’re lucky, somebody will see your name in the end credits. That is, if they even bother reading them.
But what about the names that actually draw you into the theater? Those well-known actors and directors that you follow obsessively and can apparently do no wrong? Surely they would never do anything to jeopardize their own projects! After all, it’s THEIR name on the poster, and therefore it’s THEIR name on the line. Well it may not shock you to know that lots of those hard-working professionals are just as susceptible to petty squabbles as you or I. Even if it means slowing down or stopping the progress of their own movie.
These are six classic movies that almost couldn’t overcome the feuds.

I found an awesome deal on a LEGO Storage Cart that I want to share – but first let me start this post by saying this: I have 4 boys who ask for LEGOs on every holiday, birthday or allowance-spending trip. If I had to guess how many LEGO’s are in our play room, I would say a bazillion. Squared. We have 2 (count ‘em – TWO) LEGO building tables with drawers and buckets and rubbermaid bins all trying like heck to contain and control the LEGO takeover happening in my home.
If you’re struggling like me – here’s a GREAT deal on a LEGO Storage Cart for only $37.17 Shipped!
- 6 shallow drawers
- Built-in drawer stops
- Includes 4 free-wheeling casters
- Great for use in home, office or hobby applications
- Made in USA
This IRIS 6-drawer storage cart is space-saving (Tall, not wide!), portable and the drawers are the perfect size for holding an entire LEGO set in each one. OR – if your kids are like mine – perfect for dividing types of LEGO building pieces. (Minifigures and accessories, regular bricks, moveable pieces, etc…)
This is so similar to the IRIS LEGO Storage Workstation here – but a whole lot cheaper (what IS up with that crazy price?)
And if you wanted to use this cart as a workstation – it would be super-easy to hot-glue a LEGO Building Plate to the top. (Only $5.99) Voilà! Portable LEGO Workstation!!WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. (WLFI) – A mayor from a Kansas town rebuilding from an F-5 tornado discusses recovery and green technology at Purdue.
In 2007, 95 percent of Greensburg Mayor Bob Dixson’s city was destroyed by a 2 mile-wide tornado. Currently, nearly 60 percent of the city has been rebuilt and has become a green model city.
Dixson’s lecture focused on the importance of community and how they are using green ways to rebuild. Dixson was in the area for a couple of days. He said he see similarities between the November tornadoes that hit the local area and the tornado that hit Greensburg.
“The common thread that runs through it all is — when you lose your property and there’s severe damage, it’s a tremendous loss no matter where it is in this country or around the world,” said Dixson.
Dixson spoke to more than 30 students at Potter Hall Tuesday. This the second year Dixson has given the lecture to students.General Steps for a Power Switch Repair
1. Access the Inside of the Power Tool
Example: Accessing the dw987:
2. Remove Other Parts as Necessary
Example: Removing the Transmission of the dw987:
3. Free Up the Switch Assembly
Example: Freeing up the Switch Assembly on the dw987:
4. Closely Examine the Switch's Wiring and Draw a Diagram
Example: Examining the Switch Wiring on the dw987:
5. Remove the Old Switch and Install the New Switch
Example: Installing the New Switch on the dw987:
6. Reassemble the Power Tool With Care
Example: Reassembling the dw987:
7. Test the Basic Functions of the Tool
Example: Testing the dw987:
If a bad power switch is making a tool or machine act up, replacing the old switch with a new one is usually the right fix. For more information on making sure a power switch problem is correctly diagnosed, please take a look at our Troubleshooting Guide.
This article is a 101 level repair guide that explains general steps for replacing a power switch in power tools and other machinery.
For a "Power Switch Diagnosis" article--Click here.
It is extremely important to understand that the design of power tool switches varies greatly from switch to switch, and so, the steps for replacing power switches also vary greatly from tool to tool, depending on what kind of switch it has. Differences in switch design also add different levels of complication and difficulty to each unique power switch replacement.
Again, this article will only focus on steps that are common to most switch replacements, as well as some hints and pointers for replacing power switches in general. Take a look at our other repair articles that detail specific switch replacements.
Here we use the DeWALT dw987 Cordless Drill as our walkthrough example for this repair. The switch replacement for the dw987 is a simple one, and will give us a good place to start from when talking about other, more complicated repairs.
We're going to use the DeWALT dw987 as an example below to demonstrate general steps for replacing power tool switches. Even though this is a specific repair example, the steps for this repair have been generalized to apply to most switch replacements.
For a "Diagnosing Electric Power Tools" article--Click here.
This guide will also explain some specific steps that only apply to replacing a switch in the dw987, and it will be made clear below which steps are for general application and which steps apply only to the dw987.
After preparing a safe, clean work area and double checking that the tool is disconnected from its power source,
1. Access the Inside of the Power Tool
This step is necessary to get inside the part of the power tool where the repair will take place. Most tools open up very easily; however, it's also very easy to misplace or mix up screws and other parts involved in this step if the right attention and care are not given to them
Example: Accessing the Inside of the DeWALT dw987:
Getting inside the DeWALT dw987 only involves removing a handful of screws along the housing of the drill.
[Back to top]
2. Remove Other Parts as Necessary
Example: Removing the Transmission of the DeWALT dw987:
Removing the transmission from the grip portion of a cordless drill is common for cordless drill switch repairs. This is a great example of an additional part that may need to be removed before moving on with a power switch replacement.
Removing transmissions in power drills is also a little tricky, so we'll take the time to offer a couple of pointers. The gears and other components of a drill transmission are usually held into place by a metal plate.
A transmission should be wiggled out of its place carefully. If a drill transmission is removed without delicate care, the metal plate holding it all together can pop off, spilling its gears and other guts all over the place. Below is a picture of the dw987 with its transmission removed.
3. Free Up the Switch Assembly
Example: Freeing Up the Switch Assembly on the DeWALT dw987:
A forward/reverse lever is just one small example of a component that may have to be removed from a switch assembly before it can be removed and replaced. As always, keeping track of how each component is situated can save time when it comes time to put the tool back together.
4. Closely Examine the Switch's Wiring and Draw a Diagram
This is the most important step for every power switch replacement.
This is the most important step in a switch replacement, because switches differ from each other most by how they're wired, making each switch replacement unique.
Power switches can have 2-wire, 3-wire, and 4-wire setups with other variations between them. Also, the types of wire terminals on switches can vary greatly. Below are some pictured examples of different types of switches.
Drawing a switch diagram can prevent two common switch repair disasters:
1. Mixing up the wires. Crossing wires is especially hazardous when working with DC current like with cordless power tools. If the switch wires are crossed, operating the tool will quickly cause the battery to overheat, destroying the battery and/or tool.
2. Spending time to look up a switch diagram unnecessarily.
Example: Examining the Switch Wiring on the DeWALT dw987:
The switch for the DeWALT dw987 is an example of an extremely simple switch replacement. The switch for the dw987 drill is a variable speed range switch (VSR switch) that is also compatible in several other DeWALT cordless power tools.
Most switches will have two or more wires leading out both ends, wires coming from the tool's power source and wires heading toward the motor.
This VSR switch does not have any wires leading from its battery power source like most switches, because the switch assembly plugs directly into the battery. This makes this switch installation much easier than most, and also makes drawing the diagram for this switch much more simple.
This VSR switch has two wires leading from the switch assembly to the drill's motor. The color and position of these wires should be included in the switch diagram in order not to mix them up when installing the new switch.
The wires for the dw987's switch use a clamping system that makes it so they simply snap into their places on the switch assembly. Many switch repairs require soldering to ensure better connections, but with a clamping system like this, this repair is made easier again
Here is what the VSR switch for the dw987 looks like:
Drawing a diagram of the switch wiring is extremely important. Try not to be tempted into thinking that making a diagram is a "skipable," elementary step. This recommendation comes from our on-site repairmen, who have been repairing power tools professionally for over fifteen years, and they still draw a diagram for each switch repair.
5. Remove the Old Switch and Install the New Switch.
The final product should reflect what the old switch looked like before it was removed.
6. Reassemble the Power Tool With Care
The threaded screw locations on the casings of plastic power tools can be easily stripped by metal screws. Before installing the screws, carefully back them up in reverse to allow the threads to line up straight. A lot of wearavoided this way. on the threads of a plastic casing can be
If other sensitive parts of a tool had to be removed in order to access the switch assembly (such as a transmission, in the case of the dw987), a little extra care may be needed for reassembly.
Correctly reinstalling the dw987's transmission involves a couple of extra steps. First, the transmission should be partially reinstalled, until it makes contact with handle portion of the drill. It should look like this, with a spacebetween the transmission and the motor housing:
In order to lock the transmission into place, the motor must be turned until it lines up with the gears of the transmission. Turn the motor by reinstalling the battery and gently pulling the trigger, so that the motor can turn slowly (thanks to the VSR switch). The transmission should slide into position when with little effort once the motor lines up.
Once the transmission is back in place, the tool is only a few screws away from being reassembled, and it's on to the last step.
7. Test the Basic Functions of the Tool
It's always a good idea to check all the basic features of a tool after it is reassembled, just to catch any little problems or possible oversights early on. Cycle through its basic modes and features and maybe even put it to work a little.
Test the basic features of the dw987 by:
If everything checks out, then this power switch repair is complete.
Conclusion
This guide uses the DeWALT dw987 as a walkthrough example for basic power switch repair guidelines. Yes, each power switch repair is different, and some are more involved than others, but the steps in this guide are common to most power tool and machinery switch repairs.

What we're about.Director: Stuart Beattie
Starring: Aaron Eckhart, Bill Nighy, Yvonne Strahovski, Miranda Otto, Jai Courtney
Written by: Stuart Beattie, (also story and Darkstorm Studios Graphic Novel) Kevin Grevioux and (based on characters created by) Mary Shelley
Running Time: 92 mins

Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, may I present to you, for your viewing pleasure, this year’s first official, total stinker! Yes, just as the month of January is coming to an end and we’ve had some pretty close calls, we finally get our first big time turkey. A walloping mess of a film that lacks just that one thing to make it an ultimate turkey…a sense of humour!
Victor Frankenstein is dead after trying to kill his creation. While burying the man who made him, the creature is attacked by demons and saved by gargoyles, who discover Victor’s scientific notes and become the protectors of the book. Move 200 years or so to the future and the continuing battle between demons, led by Prince Naberius and the gargoyles, with their leader, Leonore with the creature stuck in the middle. It soon becomes apparent the reason for the demons interest in the monster: Naberius wants to build an army of re-animated creatures. With the help of a beautiful scientist, Terra, the existence of Victor’s original notes becomes all-important for his plan to rule the world.
I am sure, because I haven’t read it, that the original source material, Kevin Grevioux’s Darkstorm Studio’s graphic novel, is an interesting and exciting read. The fact of the matter is that the film is neither interesting or exciting. It has all the bangs and whistles for a dumb blockbuster but absolutely no pizzazz! Just a stream of poorly constructed special effects to try to give the messy fight sequences some colour in a world of darkness.
It proudly boasts, “From The Producers of Underworld” and you can definitely see the connection. This is basically Underworld but without the vampires and werewolves and without Kate Beckinsdale in tight black latex! Another confused war between demons (passable) and Gargoyles? Yes, those concrete monsters on the top of churches come alive, take human forms, clothed like rejects from 300, and who fly around with clumping weapons to strike the devils, turning them into balls of fire. How anyone never noticed these expensive fireworks going off, we shall never know.
So the story lumbers around, going from one battle to another, in the deserpate hope of looking for some form of sense but they never find. This could have been a real blast. A tongue rammed into the cheek, a camp moment here or there, even a quip or a sharp one-liner would have helped but writer/director Stuart Beattie has removed any sense of fun that could have been, turning the whole thing into one long, po-faced bore. Everybody, and I mean everybody, is so damn serious! The lines, as clunky and clichéd as they are, are delivered like a Shakespearean sonnet! In your head, you are thinking “these guys think this is real!”
The effects are pretty low grade too. While it’s fine to cover the creatures with fire balls and shafts of light when they are disposed of, when the light show isn’t on, you get to see how terrible these creatures are. The demons look like masks left over from a Halloween party while the Gargoyles come off worse. Let’s just say the Gargoyles from Disney’s Hunchback Of Notre Dame were more realistic. Add to that a “brooding” score that plays constantly throughout the film and the annoyance level starts to rise. There isn’t a single scene where there isn’t the sound of some instrument playing morosely in the background.
The film possesses two outstanding actors who are literally wasted. Aaron Eckhart is a fine actor who has made some pretty impressive films in his career yet here, all beefed up, six-pack and all, as the creature, is dire. With a gruff voice that comes from his boots, he’s all frowns and squinting eyes and a monotone in his delivery that would make Judge Dredd proud.
Then there’s Bill Nighy. Nighy is the king of film stealing, even though he basically doesn’t often change his looks or, indeed, his delivery. Here he looks utterly bored and you get the impression that he’s there for the money as the evil Prince Naberius. He could have been all pantomime and over the top. Yet it’s a disappointment and the first time in which he hasn’t stolen the movie.
In a season of award-hunters and serious films, it would have been nice to have a pile of nonsense that could wash over you. Instead we get a pile of drivel that lacks anything close to originality and becomes tedious very quickly. If it had had a slight inject of humour, it would still have been bad but fun too. This is just plain bad! I, Frankenstein…do hear by say you are 2014’s first big turkey. You may kiss the bride!

A total of 70 students of Comprehensive School Peshawar and Lady Griffith School, along with teachers and administrative staff, were taken to Shahbaz Garhi and Takht-i-bahi, two of the most historical landmarks in K-P. The trip was sponsored by the Tourism Corporation Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (TCKP), in collaboration with the Directorate of Archaelogogy. Students were also briefed by the Archeology Director Zahoor Durrani on the historical significance of both sites. The students, much excited about the tour, greatly appreciated the corporation’s initiatives. “Everyone claims they will make a change but TCKP has actually brought a change by organising this trip,” said Maryam, a student.

The cadavers were discovered during a surprise inspection of Chambers Funeral Home & Crematorium in Riverdale late last month.
Harri Close, of the Maryland Board of Morticians and Funeral Directors, signed the order. He said he'd never seen anything like it before in Maryland.
"Body fluids were coming out of the bags," said Harri Close, of the state board. "There was no drainage in the room. The fluids were being stepped on by employees walking back into the public area."
Funeral home owner Thomas Chambers called the incident a misunderstanding. The funeral home has a contact to cremate cadavers from Georgetown University and these 46 had been delivered just before the inspection, he said.
"We are very sorry for this situation that has occurred, and we're going to keep praying very hard that we can get ourselves out of this," he said. "We made a slight error of judgment within that performance, and we're trying to rectify this through our attorneys and try to get back into business and continue on like we have been since 1914."
Close said the fact that the bodies were cadavers does not excuse the incident.
"Those individuals and families still deserve the dignity after their objective's been achieved for science," he said.
The 46 cadavers have since been cremated, and the funeral home has through Friday to hold its last funerals until a review by the board at the end of the month.
Even if its license is reinstated, Georgetown will no longer do business with Chambers, the school said.Admiral's Cup Tides 48

Box Score
Wisconsin head coach Bobbie Kelsey:
"We had some bright spots but we are not playing competitive enough to me. I'm not a good enough coach to teach someone how to be competitive - you either have it or you don't. It's indicative of the rebounds. Very lopsided, that's the most lopsided I've seen it. That's just getting after the ball. They had 24 turnovers but we didn't capitalize on it. It's just unfortunate that if the game is 20 minutes, we win it but it's not. You have to play the whole game."
On Iowa's shooting:
"They don't waste time hemming and hawing about whether they're open. They know they're open when they catch the ball. We'll catch it and look around. You have to know if you're open before you get it. Morgan did that's why she got shots off. She'd catch it and shoot. We had other people with several opportunities but recognizing and understanding when you open or not, a lot of that is instinctual."
On Iowa's Jaime Printy and Kamille Wahlin scoring:
"They are the epitome. They're not very big but they went right around us and scored layups. Right now, our own ball-stopping defense is not good at all. We work on it but it's disheartening to see someone go right by you and score a layup."
On Tiera Stephen and Lacia Gorman's defensive spark in the first half:
"Lacia and Tiera are very capable. Both of them have given us a lot on the defensive end but again, you have to be able to hit an open shot. But neither one of them, they were passing up open looks. Passing up an open shot that you can make, that's almost like a turnover. The difference between us and then is they take the open shot and for whatever reason, we're trying to do something extra."

Ebac Northern League football clubs say they will not raise basic prices when playing Darlington after increases earlier in the season prompted strong criticism from fans.
All nine clubs still to host Darlington will charge £5 or £6 for adult tickets, with concessionary admission – at Ashington – as low as £1 50.
Northern League chairman Mike Amos welcomed the clubs’ decision.
He said: “There has been a great deal of publicity about the three clubs which increased admission - one by just £1.
“The disproportionate publicity has suggested that the Northern League is full of clubs out to make a quick buck at Darlington’s expense - this shows that the total opposite is true. Quakers followers are being welcomed and treated as friends.”
Highlighting the outcry when Manchester City fans were charged £62 to attend the Arsenal match at the weekend, Mr Amos said: “Whatever happens in the Premier League, in the Northern League we try to champion fair play, and to behave as a family should.”
“I’m genuinely grateful to all those clubs for helping to strengthen our reputation.”
Shildon, due to host their championship chasing neighbours in April, were the last club – at a board meeting on Monday evening – to decide to peg prices.
“It could be their last away game in the Northern League and we are determined to give their supporters an excellent match day experience,” said club chairman Brian Burn.
Darlington chairman Denis Pinnegar said he was “delighted” at the news.
He said: “It’s great that our fans aren’t being taken advantage of and I hope they will spend a lot of money in bars and on programmes and the like, so that clubs will appreciate the value of the Darlington fan base.”
Quakers travel to Sunderland RCA on Saturday. £5 tickets for the game are available at the Darlington club shop in the covered market or from the host club. In an attempt to address car parking problems, admission is £6 on the day.
Norton and Stockton Ancients FC, West Auckland and Celtic Nation all increased their prices for the visit of Darlington.

Don't quite agree with Amos' quote though...
"The disproportionate publicity has suggested that the Northern League is full of clubs out to make a quick buck at Darlington’s expense - this shows that the total opposite is true."
It isn't the total opposite, his statement should read that "...the Northern League includes a small number out to make a quick buck at Darlington’s expense".
People shouldn't forget those 3 clubs, however small a proportion of the overall league they may be.

Greenfinger, if you go to watch a Darlington game at Heritage Park, you will be charged £8. The next league game will be the same price, and so will the one after that. The price doesn't go up due to the potential number of visiting fans there could be to exploit.
And yes, it would be fair for your club to charge £8 entry, if that's what you choose to charge EVERYONE.

An Albuquerque mother is accused of holding a knife to her 5-year-old daughter's head and throwing the family's puppy off a two-story balcony.
According to criminal complaint, an anonymous caller told APD Dispatch that there was female, later identified as Clarissa Chino, chasing a male with a knife and also had a box of beer in her other hand.
Chino's boyfriend, James Atkins also called police and told them, Chino was drunk at their apartment near Central and Wyoming and attempted to stab their 5-year-old daughter with a knife.
Atkins told police Chino and her friend were arguing inside the residence. Atkins asked the two leave because he didn't want them arguing in front of their children. Atkins said Chino took offense and pointed a knife at him. When he ran down the stairs Chino threw the family's puppy off the stairs and then grabbed her daughter while holding the knife before leaving the apartment.
Police found Chino near Central Avenue and Charleston Avenue, where officers detained her for interviewing.
Chino told police she was trying to leave the apartment when Atkins grabbed her hair and scratched her because he didn't want her to leave. She further stated that she never armed herself with a knife and never threw the puppy from the deck.
The child wasn't hurt, but the dog was taken by Animal Control to an emergency vet hospital with several injuries.
Chino was booked for aggravated assault against a household member, two counts of aggravated assault, abandonment or abuse of child, and cruelty to.Free Issue KWM Construction Practice — February 2013

NZL SHOWS SIXTH SENSE IN QUALIFYING
A1 Team New Zealand produced a consistent result in Qualifying at Brands Hatch for the seventh and final round of the A1GP World Cup of Motorsport championship, with sixth place on the grid for both the Sprint and Feature Races.
A highlight of the four Qualifying sessions for New Zealand was driver Earl Bamber's car speed without the PowerBoost being used. Of all the lap times set in Qualifying, Bamber recorded the second fastest lap without PowerBoost which will stand him in good stead for the two races on Sunday.
New Zealand got off to a gentle start with the thirteenth fastest time in Qualifying One. Then despite being one of the last nations to hit the track in Qualifying Two, Bamber got to work with the PowerBoost activated, and recorded the sixth fastest lap time.
Four of the top six nations in Qualifying for the Sprint Race all used the PowerBoost. However Ireland put in an amazing lap to qualify on Pole Position without using the PowerBoost. Ireland's time was set at 1.11.615, while New Zealand was 0.493 seconds off the Irish time with a 1.12.108.
Things heated up in the second two Qualifying sessions, which determines the grid for the Feature Race. New Zealand were quick early on, crossing the line second fastest in Qualifying Three, only to be bumped back by Ireland and Monaco. Switzerland was the early leader after taking an alternative strategy which saw them use the PowerBoost lap in Q3 instead of the preferred Q4.
Entering Q4, the pressure was on with the championship battle for a number of nations coming down to the wire. Monaco was fastest early on, but a spin then contact with the tyre barriers for Brazil bought out a yellow flag.
New Zealand and a number of other nations were still in the pit lane at this stage with just over two minutes remaining in the session. Luckily for New Zealand and other teams, there was no need for a red flag and the session continued.
Having already used their PowerBoost lap in Q2, New Zealand made some further changes to Black Beauty in the quest for an even better chassis setup than in the earlier Qualifying sessions.
The changes paid off, with Bamber taking Black Beauty for a lap of Brands Hatch that was fast enough for sixth place on the grid for the Feature Race, and by far the fastest in Q4 of the drivers without PowerBoost. Nations such as Mexico that also used PowerBoost in Q2 to set the second fastest time for the Sprint Race grid dropped back down the order significantly in Qualifying for the Feature Race.
Things didn't go so well for championship leader Switzerland however, with Neel Jani spearing the Swiss car into a gravel trap in the final Qualifying session. The Swiss had however set a time in Q3 that will see them start from fourth place for the Feature Race.
With their PowerBoost lap kept until Q4, Ireland were able to make it a Pole Position double, setting up an exciting Sunday of racing at Brands Hatch. Ireland was also the only nation to dip into the one minute ten second lap times, with a 1.10.902, compared with New Zealand's 1.11.633.
New Zealand's result of two sixth places gives Bamber and the team a good chance to stay clear of the 'mid pack' chaos and sets New Zealand up with a chance to claw back one or two places in the championship standings.
Highlights of Qualifying can be seen on TV3 at 1pm on Sunday, while coverage of both the Sprint and Feature Races starts on Monday morning at 1am.
Earl Bamber, Driver
"We were aiming to be in the top-six to start both races, and we delivered on our goal which is promising."
"Now we focus on staying out of trouble, possibly making up some ground in the pitstops, and being there at the race finishes."
"We're getting better with more and more laps. It's one of those circuits where track knowledge really helps."
Colin Giltrap, A1 Team New Zealand Seat Holder
"I'm more than happy with our result considering everything; it puts us in a position to keep out of trouble and get on with the races."
"This is the trickiest track in the UK. Earl's coming on well and will be good in the races."

Direct or Indirect, Mortgages Are Flawed
April Charney is a consumer lawyer in Florida and Arkansas and the manager of a lawyer-only Foreclosure Defense and Prevention listserv for Jacksonville Area Legal Aid.
October 16, 2012
Direct lending is one way that the government could get involved in the mortgage market, but remember: The government is already integrated vertically and horizontally and up to its eyeballs in this business.
For many Americans, mortgages themselves are a bad fit: individuals who might be injured and out of work for six months, or families that could go from two incomes to one, or households entering retirement and living on a fixed income. For these and many other income-sensitive and credit-precarious American families, we need to think beyond the mortgage -- not just add the government as another lender. And the current mortgage system already caters to the Americans who can comfortably afford a mortgage, with little risk of foreclosure -- the sort of borrowers to whom the government would want to issue mortgages.
For those who are eager to fault banks for messing up the mortgage market, it is worth considering that this country lacks sufficient income and creditworthy prospective residential borrowers to fuel a mortgage market of any meaningful size without significant up-front system-wide subsidies and without life-of-loan default prevention customer service built into the project.
Given this landscape, why did banks determine that it was acceptable to shareholder interests to disregard due diligence and other legal standards? Consider the risks the banks heaped on their shareholders (especially our pensions and state investments) by neglecting their legal obligations during the inflation of the most recent housing bubble.
The same arrogance, ignorance and greed that inflated the bubble also popped it, but the Fed’s desperately low interest rates won’t be a refinancing bonanza for banks, as some predict. Too many problems remain: we have failed to deal with exaggerated appraisals underlying the stinky mortgages and the refinancing deals. We have failed to deal with the losses to the banks resulting from bundling and the creation of "nothing-backed" securities. The banks continue to use false appraisals and "stated income" applications in the refinance process without requisite due diligence or compliance with traditional underwriting limitations. And we don't yet know the effect of a bogus refinancing will be, when the bank doing the refinancing doesn't own the loan or even have authority to refinance it.
That’s just a starting point for the drilling that needs to happen. From the trenches, I see a failure of the banks to mark to market. I question how this country will deal with an aging (and abandoned) housing stock. So many experts aren’t even talking about this. I also question why we listen to the banks’ reports and statements, after the track record. And finally, I seriously doubt the sustainability or stability of a mortgage market built overwhelmingly on refinances.
What’s the solution? Some transparency would be a start. Each bank should detail for each refinancing: the age of the home; the fair-market value or appraisal of the home; the original balance of the loan; the current balance of the loan; whether the loan is wholly owned or securitized; and whether the bank owns or services the loan. And we need a system to verify appraisals so that we can at least see a bottom to the value spiral in our lifetime.
Now let’s talk about where we go from here.

Mr. Phillips' death was confirmed by the D'Anjolell Memorial Home in Broomall.
"We got so much because of Richie: pensions, vacations, better salaries," former umpire and board member Don Denkinger said Tuesday.
Mr. Phillips represented NBA referees in the 1970s and '80s and led MLB umps from 1978 until 1999, when a failed tactic of mass resignations cost 22 umpires their jobs. The setback prompted umpires to abandon his Major League Umpires Association and form a new union, the World Umpires Association.
Mr. Phillips liked to tell the story of how, at age 13 while living in the Philadelphia area, he led a strike of altar boys at his parish over a dispute about their tips. In years to come, his work stoppages involved a lot more money.
Under Mr.," he said. "But he wanted baseball to know that we were important, that we were valuable and worth it."

Make October your last test, especially if you score in a similar range, or even if you do a lot better in verbal. btw, since verbal seems to be a bit of a weak point, get Verbal Workout (PR's book, methinks) - it will help you crack the verbal.

Why are you so adamant in posting the same reply every time the question arises? We are not talking about someone taking the test for the 17th time!
It would be fair to start you reply with:
"It is my opinion and belief that they DO care .... ".
You are entitled to your opinion and can post it as many times as you wish. However, I have repeatedly posted that your opinion is inconsistent with the consensus of this board. Furthermore, I have received confirmation from several schools that your position is totally incorrect. I have copied the emails on this board for everyone to see. Do you believe that, rather than getting the information for the horse's mouth, I polled the wrong side of the animal?

<!-Text-!> Xiggi, my older brother works in Admissions for a major university. My posts reflect things I've learned from him and his colleagues. He would encourage someone who has studied well and progressed in their scores to retake, but within limits. They want to see students who are balanced in their efforts. An SAT test is a one-time display of potential ability, but sustained grades and activities in and outside of school is what they care a LOT more about.
But this comes down to common sense...if you score about the same after taking the test three times and prepared adequately for it, then yes, it is stupid to retake. And YES, they do wonder what the hell is the matter with people who retake repeatedly for a precious 20 or 30 more, but yes, inconsequential, points. Three times is ok, four isn't questioned if you've improved dramatically, but if you take the thing 5 or 6 times, they DO wonder why you haven't moved on to something more important.
Important rule of thumb: An SAT score can not get you in. It can keep you out if it's well below the school's average, especially if your other qualifications are lacking, but a higher score WILL NOT GET YOU IN. <!-/Text-!>

Thank you for posting your reply.
I agree 100% with you that it comes down to common sense. That is why I would not endorse the idea of taking the SAT 7-8 times, EVEN if my favorite school tells me that they do not care
However, I believe that people may be frightened by reading a post that discourage them to take the test, say for a third time. I also believe that most students BELIEVE that they will do better NEXT time and do not take it for the sake of wasting a saturday.
In a perfect world, one student would prepare himself to the best of his ability and roll the dice for a maximum of two times and would only retake it a third time AFTER making sure that he WILL improve by checking his practices tests.
However, I still believe that a student has MORE to gain by retaking the SAT than accepting his score with resignement out of fear of the school possibly frowning on the number of trials.
To give an added dimension, one school even told me that I had nothing to lose by retaking a 780/760. Obviously, that is an advice that I am not about to follow

I would agree with that statement but the problem is that it is NOT what adcoms say. See my post above this one! If you have received contradictory information by some adcoms, please post the schools they represent. I promise to send them an email immediately and admit my mistake, were they to confirm that position. This is not a personal issue to me!

<!-Text-!> Seriously email the admissions officers...
I have...and they simply DO NOT CARE.
(I would like to bold those words but I dont know how)
but anyways look...I do not know the policy of the colleges you are applying to Uniqueid, but the majority of schools that I have talked/emailed to, told me that they will only look at their HIGHEST SCORES. I know dozens of people who have taken the SAT more than 4 times, and they still have gotten into awesome schools. Taking the SAT 100 times will not be frowned upon. The person might have a serious psychological problem...but adcoms are not going to hold that against you.
BFT: like Xiggi said...I also want to know the schools admissons officer you talked with. <!-/Text-!>

My standard disclaimer is that I am not an attorney, nor do I play one on the Internet. However, I do work as a Special Education Advocate, so bullying is a problem I help parents with, as over 90% of children with special needs are bullying victims.
Please keep in mind that although I try to remain positive, I do have a cynical point of view at times which may show through on this post. But remember, no one ever calls a Special Education Advocate because they just love their school, love their IEP and how their child is being treated and are just so over the moon that they want to share, ha ha. I get calls because parents are frustrated, angry and don’t know what to do.
Schools bear some responsibility
First (and this is where it sounds like I’m giving legal advice, but I’m not!), know that in recent court cases, that the case law decisions are supporting the notion that schools bear some responsibility for bullying, in particular cyber-bullying, that occurs outside of the school day. Now, I’m not suggesting that you go hunt down court cases and start quoting case law. But know that so far, the law is on your side if your child is the victim of such bullying and you are thinking or being told, “That didn’t happen at school, not our responsibility.” That’s not what the recent court decisions are saying. Schools not only have a moral responsibility to help, but depending on the situation, a legal one too.
My child thankfully has not been bullied yet at school, though we have had a few minor incidents at playgrounds and other public places. However, if he was being bullied, here is how I would handle it, in incremental steps.
Put it in writing
One of my golden rules for ALL school issues is: write it down. There’s nothing wrong with talking it out on the phone or in person, but always use e-mail to document it. So send a note: “Thanks so much for chatting with me today about Susie being bullied. I appreciate that you’re going to ….to try to remedy the situation.”
If you don’t write it down, it didn’t happen. If this drags on for months or even years, you want it documented in writing. So that would be my first step, a simple e-mail to the teacher. “Dear Mr. Teacher, Susie has been reporting to me that during lunch, the other kids are … Can we please make a time to chat about this on the phone or in person over the next couple of days?”
If that doesn’t resolve it, another, firmer e-mail. Still not resolved? Write a new one to the principal, include the previous ones you have sent to teacher. While this is going on, you need to document whatever your child is telling you. Ask him/her where and when the bullying occurred and what staff was around. Know that statistics tell us that teachers generally only see about 10% of the bullying that occurs, and that’s a Dept. of Ed statistic!
A Gebser letter
So, you’ve done a bunch of letters and meetings, it’s still not stopping. Consider hiring an attorney and submitting a Gebser letter to the district. Note that this is specifically for discrimination, but that can be race, religion, sex, disability and so on. The term Gebser letter comes from a 1998 Supreme Court decision. The court concluded that in order to receive damages under a Title IX discrimination suit, you must prove that the school district actually knew about the offense and refused to take action to correct it. The term “Gebser Letter” was coined to mean a letter notifying a school district employee with authority about the discrimination or bullying.
This is why all the documentation is important. You will have to show that you have notified the school district numerous times to try to resolve this, and that they failed to act.
Know the policies
You should read your school district policies (online, usually). Most districts have an anti-bullying policy of some kind. Most also have a grievance procedure. Consider filing a grievance with your school board and ask to be put on the agenda for a school board meeting.
Bullies have parents too
Lastly, remember that the bully has parents too. And probably nice parents. Sure, some parents are jerks who don’t care when their kids do this. But I’ve also worked with parents whose kids are bullying. And they were doing everything they could to try to make it stop. Still, peer pressure is so powerful, some kids continue to do it. I even worked with one.
Don't retaliate
Also remember that retaliation is not acceptable and in some cases illegal. You and your family cannot be retaliated against for reporting bullying and trying to handle a situation...AGA ALEBS-36-DF-VWT

If you're ever in Ft. Worth during the summer, there are two attractions that are a must; the western style saloons at The Stockyards and cruising the historical Main Street. For decades, the weekend warriors of Rat Rods, Hot Rods, Harleys, and yes, the juiced up Lowriders have continued to cruise this boulevard. Cruising down Main Street remains an admired, yet fading privilege, due to the bans by many municipals throughout the southwest. For one local, Alex Casso, he reminisces of his initial cruise on this legendary strip as an eye opening experience. "While in middle school, my older brothers Sal and Miguel took me cruising down Main." Growing up in the city's north side, it wasn't uncommon to see Lowriders drive up and down its barrio streets, but that night on this Cowtown's famous street, Alex witnessed these automotive expressions in a whole new light. It was then that he knew his future would include candy paint, chrome, and hitting the switches. Although a few years from getting his driver's license, Alex was soon a student of this automotive culture as family friends Pancho and Abel Moreno not only taught Alex the ins-and-outs under the hood, but that of the art and history that Lowriding entails.
In 1999, with his license in hand and help from the jefe, Alex purchased his first ride; a '95 Mitsubishi Galant. He remembers hitting the scene with the D's, the juice, and the booming of the bass, but he still felt an automotive emptiness. In time, Alex knew he wanted to go more old school, and after building a few street cruisers to include a cherry '85 Regal with 8k miles, he knew that only "the bowtie" could fill that void. The hunt began for a '61 Impala and Alex soon realized finding the right one was no easy task. Nearly giving up, and going through the daily regimen of endless auto trader websites, Alex found this desert city cruiser on EBay and outbid his fellow bubbletop aficionados. "That weekend we packed up the family for the 18 hour trip to El Paso to pick up the car. We'll never forget it," reveals his wife, Cristina.
After getting the "void fulfiller" back to North Texas, Alex and his sons began the task of tearing down the car. Soon after, the recession hit home and appeared that this project would be on hold indefinitely. This temporarily put a damper on Alex's wallet, but not his heart. Once financially back on track, this passionate Impala owner decided that instead of having one shop take the reins, he would personally oversee the process and utilize each shop's specialty in this build. After four years, it appears that his plan was successful with the completion of this Cowtown cruiser. A special thanks goes out to his wife, Cristina, as well as Renato, Alex Jr., Caraline, and brothers Sal and Miguel for their support during this fulfilling bowtie build. Paz, Tejas

Tumors of the extremities include :
1. Vascular hamartosis – a malformation in which newly formed vessels proliferate.
2. Klippel-Weber-Trenaunay syndrome should be considered in the differential diagnosis. The hemangiomas may vary in size and location. Some authors do not consider them to be true tumors, but rather suspect them to represent vascular malformations.
Huge hemangioma of the fetal thigh (arrow).
Arterial Doppler signals obtained from blood vessels within the tumor.

3. Lymphangioma. A cavernous lymphangioma involves the lymphatic vessels and is related to cystic hygroma, thus considered a malformation.
4. Sarcoma – mainly rhabdomyosarcoma. This should be distinguished from infantile myofibromatosis.

COUNCIL GROVE, Kan. (WIBW) -- Thursday crews from Council Grove finished blocking off a section of North Neosho Road, because of a building collapsing. The building, which housed Waddell and Reed, started to collapse on Monday.
Assistant Manager of the Neosho Plaza Apartments, Sylvia Riffel said "When I came home last night I noticed the wall was completely gone. So as you can see they barricaded the whole area." Riffel said she started notifying tenants on Monday to move their cars so nothing would get damaged.
The part of North Neosho Road is blocked off in front of the building, and three other buildings were condemned. Mayor of Council Grove, Steve Shepard said this was done to make sure no one got hurt.
Shepard said "We have contacted an architectural engineer so we know how to take the structure down. We don't want to just start pecking away. We want to make sure we are taking it down right."
The buildings around the collapsed one Shepard said, are beeing held up by a few retaining walls. He also said they had to cut down some of power line supporters near the building, because if they were to be damaged the whole city could lose power.
There are no injuries, and the building has not harmed any other building at this point.Please select category that most closely reflects your concern about the post, so that we can review it and determine if it violates our Terms of Use or isn't appropriate for viewers.

Many Americans eat processed meats every day despite the fact that they're loaded with preservatives.
Now, new research published in the British Journal of Cancer shows a link between processed meats, like bacon, sausage, hot dogs and lunchmeat, etc., and pancreatic cancer.
The study of nearly 7,000 pancreatic cancer cases found that for every 50-gram serving of processed meat consumed, or about one link of sausage, your chance for pancreatic cancer increases 19 percent.
Previous studies showed a link between processed meats and colon cancer.
The Swedish researchers explained that the problem with processed meats is the added nitrites and nitrate chemicals that preserve the meats and add color and flavor.
The good news, however, is that nitrates aren't found in many organic meats.
"Look for products that don't have nitrites because the nitrites are the ones that they think are causing the cancer," Dr. Richard Besser, ABC News chief health and medical editor, advised.
While cutting out processed food is important for good health, experts suggest you can also significantly reduce your cancer risk by doing the following:
"Pancreatic cancer has poor survival rates," warned Susanna Larsson, an associate professor at the Karolinska Institute. "So as well as diagnosing it early, it's important to understand what can increase the risk of this disease."

From 1922 on, Hindemith began to deal extensively with the viola d’amore. It was the Little Sonata, Op. 25 No. 2, a work which Hindemith himself featured on several concert programmes, together with the works of other composers for the viola d’amore of Hindemith’s time. Hindemith was fascinated by the instrument and in 1926 had one specially made for him (which instead of the usual angel is decorated with the head of his wife, Gertrud).
In addition to the Little Sonata, this album contains the Kammermusik No. 6 and works by Stamitz and Biber with the basso continuo parts realized by Hindemith. Our soloist, Gunter Teuffel plays Hindemith’s own viola d’amore, a fact that gives the whole production a unique "personal" sound. Because of this connection, this album not only presents a very interesting new facet of Hindemith, but as a result of the unique sensitivity of the musicians, is a particularly intimate encounter with the composer.
Gunter Teuffel is a student of Sandor Végh and William Primrose, and for decades has been regarded as an authority on the viola d’amore and has released several albums.

My impression is that Blu-Ray beats HD-DVD up and down the block with a stick. The unit was a DBP-S1 that will retail for $999.95 - this was described as Sony's flagship model with an extremely impresive build quality. It was outputing a 1080i stream that was upconverted to 1080p on a 50 inch flat pannel display. I could not tell but I have a feeling it was an lcd. The clips that were used included Chicken Little RV Click The color on the RV clip was jaw dropping. Chicken Little was used to show image detail which was very impressive. I wish that the Toshiba HD-DVD player was hooked up to the same equipment for a true comparison but the Tosh was hooked to a 50" rear projection dlp model. The HD-DVD player picture was nice but did not come close to provoking the same viseral response as the Blu-Ray player. The Sony rep explained that there would be massive product announcements in early June of recievers, televisions, and projectors that will be specificaly designed to take advantage of Blu-Ray. He also explained that models will be produced that will be competative with HD-DVD in the future. Sony considers Blu-Ray to be one of the biggest product launches in their history. All divisions of the company are working hard to make Blu-Ray the standard. I gotta tell ya, I am no longer interested in HD-DVD at all.

wow such hatred. Look I went to Toshiba's pre launch demo and Sony's and they both just had clips. No software was available at the time. I am actually impressed with Sony becuase they did not use a wildy slanted split screen demo like Toshiba did. Haveing seen both systems my preference is definately toward Sony, and Blu-Ray.

- how can you definitively say that the Blu-Ray picture quality was actually better? By your own admission, the two set-ups were completely different from one another, with the Blu-Ray one being a demo set up by the manufacturer. Obviously, the Blu-Ray set-up is going to be tweaked to hell and back for such a demo, whereas for all you know, the HD-DVD set up in the same store could've been set up by any of their workers, and who knows what settings they have it running at... The only true comparison I'll listen to is one that uses the SAME software titles taken from the same HD master tapes and mastered to both Blu-Ray and HD-DVD, and with both machines hooked up to the SAME calibrated-equipment via HDMI jacks as a double-blind test. There's simply no way for your "comparison" to be considered valid at all. Vincent

If I had to chose between the two based on what I saw with HD-DVD and Blu-Ray I would have picked the Blu-Ray system. Notice that I preface everything with "I". I do not presume to believe that "I" means everyone, or the my opinion is ever fact, something a good many people on this board need to learn. Is Blu-Ray better, hell it sure looked better to me. And really that is all I am saying. I can definitively say that the Blu-Ray demo looked better. That is all, was it valid for "you" no certainly not, and I even expressed your concerns. So please I would appreciate it if you got off my ass Vincent.

Vincent, remember that he saw both the HD-DVD & Blu-Ray demos...both of which were probably configured to really show off the devices. Sure, the Blu-Ray is fresher in his mind, but he did see both demos and prefers Blu-Ray. Thanks for giving your opinion David.

Huh? Not only will both the Sony and the Samsung support 1080p out of the gate, but they will also be the first players to upconvert standard DVD to 1080p as well. Not to mention the $699 PlayStation 3 will have 1080p support out of the box as well.

I'm sorry. But all of this, inclusive of the "demonstration" is totally meaningless. Is there any major visual difference between the two formats? No! Different manufacturers; different licensing; different egos. Any demonstration set up as these have been is akin to selling snake oil, with a bit of smoke and several mirrors to hype "quality." An illusion! Absolutely and undeniably Worthless. Both formats will look superb. This is total waste of time and effort, and no way to run a true "demonstration." Here she is ladies and gentlemen...

Well, Mr. Harris, I can give you something to ponder. Say two of the films you worked on: "My Fair Lady" and "Lawrence of Arabia". Both LONG films. You want the best picture and sound, so maximum bitrate and a Dolby TrueHD track. What would you prefer them on? A dual-layer 30GB HD-DVD or a 50GB DL Blu-ray disc? We pretty much thought DVD was great out of the box. As the years passed and new transfer technology and compression methods improved, those first DVD releases no longer look so great. Which format has the most room to grow and evolve? It isn't the one that's based on older DVD technology.

I would turn that argument around and ask- after 10 years of DVD, why is it desireable to buy into another format that 'needs' time to evolve and grow? and since DVD is already established at this point- where is the incentive to subsidize a new format that is that far away from maturity? (this is assuming you are correct that it needs time to reach its full potential). to me, that isn't a benefit, it's a demerit. DVD was the rehersal, the next format better be ready for prime time. and at least one of them appears to be at this point.

Again, Blu-ray wins on that point. Toshiba can't even make a proper deck. Even Samsung can do that! Plus may I mention Blu-ray has a 54Mbps capability, compared to HD DVD's 36Mbps. (Then again, judging by your sig you'll probably ignore that too). 3 months from now we'll have a Sony, a Samsung, a Panasonic, and a Pioneer Blu-ray decks. You'll have 2 Toshibas and an RCA which is a re-labled Toshiba. And you want to talk about who's not ready for prime time????

It is worth noting that Blu-Ray recording decks and blank discs have been on sale to the public for some time now — two years? It has been the movie studios holding up the train as they waited to perfect their "copy protection" schemes.

Don't know if you caught the recent Facebook post featuring a new selection of photos of Sarasota Ballet dancers taken by the gifted Sarasota photographer Barbara Banks. If not, take a look.
They certainly are a shift from the barely bare-shouldered and conventional head shots of seasons past!
I don't want to diminish in any way the beauty of this art -- nor hesitate to acknowledge that dancers are, indeed, remarkable physical specimens -- but am I the only one who feels a little uneasy about the sexual "come on" aspect of some of these poses?
On the one hand, this certainly underscores the shape you must be in to perform ballet at a high level. On the other, does playing up the "pin up" nature with this presentation diminish the attention that should be paid to these dancers as bona fide artists and athletes?
It certainly is a good marketing ploy, that's for sure!
Let me know what you think. I'd really be interested to get a conversation going on this.The cream of the ACC reloads in recruiting
The top four teams in the Atlantic Coast Conference finished the 2006 regular season ranked in the top 10 nationally -- top seven if you want to get specific. Three of those teams (Duke, Wake Forest and Virginia) made it to the Elite Eight, with the Demon Deacons and the Cavaliers advancing to the College Cup.
Things again look bright for ACC soccer heading into 2007, although two of the conference's top teams will have some holes to fill. Virginia and Maryland lost two top players apiece by the time the first 10 names were called in January's MLS draft.
That said, here's a look at the new faces entering the ACC this fall:
Duke: The Blue Devils shared the conference title with in-state and conference rival Wake Forest, but took an advantage when they defeated the Demon Deacons 1-0 in overtime of the ACC tournament.
Duke experienced a tough overtime loss of its own a few weeks later, getting knocked out of the postseason by national runner-up UCLA 3-2 in the Elite Eight. Expectations will be higher than usual this fall as the team returns 10 of 11 starters from the 2006 campaign -- the lone loss being forward Chris Loftus, who was picked up by the New England Revolution in the MLS supplemental draft.
Still, the focus this offseason appears to have been on strengthening the backfield. Coach John Rennie has brought in two defenders of national team caliber, Doug Ferner and Christian Ibeagha. Many experts consider Ferner to be the top incoming defender in the nation and one of the top recruits overall. Ibeagha is a two-time All-American who is training with the U-17 national team in Bradenton, Fla. The addition of forward Nick Sih (one of six players to receive both youth and high school All-American honors from the NSCAA in 2006) and attacking midfielder Cole Grossman will add depth to the Blue Devils' offense.
Wake Forest: Co-champions in the ACC, the Demon Deacons advanced to the College Cup before falling to eventual champion UCSB. Seven of last year's starters were underclassmen, giving those in Winston-Salem, N.C., reason to be excited about the 2007 season even before the newest crop of Deacs was announced. Wake Forest snagged Corbin Bone, one of the most sought-after recruits in the nation. The midfielder (out of Plano, Texas) was the 2006 NCSAA Youth Soccer Player of the Year and is exactly what a team that graduated three MLS draft picks at the position needs.
Because of Wake's relative youth, filling the holes left by Well Thompson (New England), Ryan Solle (New England) and Steve Curfman (Salt Lake) was the only real concern in the offseason. In addition to Bone, coach Jay Vidovich brings in midfielders Russ Coleman (Norman, Okla.) and Jeff Leach (New Canaan, Conn.). Both have ODP regional-level experience, and Leach is a two-time NSCAA All-American. Ike Opara rounds out the letter of intent signees as the only non-midfielder in the lineup. Opara, a defender out of relatively nearby Durham, battled injuries as a high school player, but Vidovich sees potential in his abilities.
Virginia: The Cavaliers had three players taken in January's MLS draft, including redshirt freshman Bakary Soumare by the Chicago Fire with the No. 2 pick overall. Four picks later, Colorado took midfielder Nico Colaluca. Forward Adam Cristman went in the fourth round to complete the trifecta.
However, long before his former players' names were called in Indianapolis, Virginia coach George Gelnovatch had begun working to find their replacements.
"With Bakary Soumare, we kind of thought that this might happen, that he might leave early," Gelnovatch said. "So we recruited in advance and picked up a couple of very good backs in Givens and Cyrus."
Colin Givens and T.J. Cyrus have U-18 national team experience. Cyrus was the NSCAA Virginia Player of the Year, and Givens received All-American honors from the coaching organization. Filling the void left by the second pick in the draft is a challenge, but Gelnovatch said he expects both players -- as well as the school's three other recruits -- to have a noticeable impact their first year with the Cavs.
Goalkeeper Danny Louisignau and midfielder Jimmy Simpson have experience at the ODP regional team level.
However, the team's lone player without some sort of national team experience might be the biggest signing.
"Jason Kim has the potential to be, in my opinion, the top recruit in the entire country," Gelnovatch said. "One guy who's tough to replace is the No. 6 overall pick, Nico Colaluca. We feel like Kim is a guy that's kind of going to help fill that attacking void."
Maryland: The Terrapins find themselves in a situation almost identical to Virginia's. Maryland lost junior midfielder Maurice Edu and sophomore goalkeeper Chris Seitz to the professional ranks -- with Edu being the top overall choice and Seitz going fourth.
"We have a little bit of a bigger challenge this year because we've had some guys decide to leave early," coach Sasho Cirovski said of the recruiting process back in December, a week after Seitz and Edu declared themselves eligible for the draft.
Cirovski signed a six-player class comprising two keepers, two midfielders, a forward and a defender -- to help fill those holes and improve the Terps overall. Although it will be tough to replace the players Cirovski described as the best defensive midfielder and best goalkeeper in the nation, Maryland has a few talented recruits who will vie for the right to replace the pair of top-five draft picks.
Thorne Holder will be the favorite for the starting job between the pipes. Holder is the starting keeper for Trinidad and Tobago's U-23 Olympic pool and has international experience with the Soca Warriors youth national team. The team also signed local product Will Swaim as a goalkeeper. Throw last year's backup Josh Mikulewicz into the mix, and it's going to be interesting to see how things shake out in the net.
Yannick Salmon is a good pickup, and Cirovski believes he is capable of playing a center back role in addition to playing midfield. Salmon, captain of the East Regional ODP team and a member of the U-17 Jamaican national team, will add depth to the lineup. The same can be said for forward Billy Cortes, who played for a Mission Viejo Pateadores club known for producing high-level collegiate players -- including Edu.
Editor's note: Up next week, Maria Burns completes her look at the ACC's incoming faces as she examines how the rest of the teams will rely on their recruits to help them as they try to move into the conference's upper echelon.

CURRENT TRENDS AND CHALLENGES IN STATE INNOVATION PROGRAMS
Dan Berglund
State Science and Technology Institute (SSTI)
Mr. Berglund began by introducing the State Science and Technology Institute (SSTI), a 15-year-old national nonprofit organization based in Columbus. With 180 members, including state programs, local programs, and universities, SSTI’s mission is to “improve government-industry programs that encourage economic growth through the application of science and technology.” Its founding funders include the Carnegie Corporation, Kauffman Foundation, and Manufacturing Extension Program, with additional support from the Economic Development Administration.
Mr. Berglund said that SSTI believes that there are seven elements required for a vibrant technology-based economy. These include “a good intellectual infrastructure, spillovers of knowledge from universities and networks, a strong physical infrastructure, a technically skilled workforce, sources of capital, a rich entrepreneurial culture, and a desirable quality of life.” The last two assets, he said, are the most difficult to measure. He offered one definition of an entrepreneurial culture: “If you gather all your family and friends in a room and tell them you’re quitting your job to start a company, and if they all applaud, you’re in an entrepreneurial culture.” Good quality of life, he said, “is in eye of beholder.”
Research Parks: Necessary, But Not Sufficient
Why should states spend so much effort building up these seven elements? Mr. Berglund asked. He told the story of going to Kentucky 10 years ago to help the state start its S&T strategic planning process. When he asked state officials what motivated them to act, they pointed to the success of nearby North Carolina in founding Research Triangle Park. They had seen that in 1955, the year before the founding of RTP, both states were poor, with virtually identical per capita incomes at 66 percent of the national level. By 2000, however, North Carolina had moved far ahead of Kentucky, which did not have a research park.
Mr. Berglund said that he later went back to look at the statistics himself, and drew out the chart showing sharply diverging income levels and North Carolina’s relative improvement. “I saw three messages in that chart,” he recalled. “The first was the same one they had seen in Kentucky, that North Carolina had moved far ahead. But the second message was that it took 30 yearsSilent Hill is one of my favorite series and I have played most of the SH games, so I was looking forward to getting the new Downpour game that was supposed to come out this October. Even if this game isn't as good as the first two (and I'm not getting my hopes up) I still planned on buying it on day one.
I was thinking of actually pre ordering it so I went to Amazon.com to see if they had any good, order from us, deals. But when I checked it out they had a release date of March 31st 2012. Amazon could be wrong, but they're usually right about release dates. Or at least they are with the games I've gotten.
The good thing (if this news is true) is that with all of the games coming out this year I'll have more than enough games to keep me busy until Silent Hill is released. The bad news is that I'm still greedy and I want that game now.
At least that HD collection of Silent Hill 2 and 3 is still scheduled to be released in December. And the postponed release date gave me a new blog, so all is good.Project Showcase

Somerset's Jos Buttler emerges as England Twenty20 rising star in New Zealand
Posted: February 15, 2013|
Jos Buttler on his way to a maiden half-century at full international level
Jos Buttler’s emergence as a rising star of international Twenty20 cricket is rewarding the faith England have placed in the Somerset stalwart as a wicketkeeper-batsman.
Buttler’s maiden half-century at full international level could not keep England competitive as New Zealand outplayed them on Tuesday for a 55-run win which made it 1-1 in the three-match series.
However, it was another undeniable demonstration of the 22-year-old’s precocious talent, as he followed up successive fifties last week in England’s two warm-up matches against a New Zealand XI.
In the absence of Kevin Pietersen, rested until the start of the Test series next month and yet to play a Twenty20 international since his temporary limited-overs retirement last year, England still have a clutch of ‘game-changers’ in their ranks.
Somerset’s Buttler is most definitely one, and it seems his status as first-choice wicketkeeper may have helped him to turn potential into runs.
It is a moot point whether it was the intention of England’s new limited-overs coach Ashley Giles – when he nominated Buttler to keep wicket ahead of Jonny Bairstow at the start of this tour – Bairstow will be entrusted with the gloves for the one-day international series which follows almost immediately after tomorrow’s Twenty20 decider in Wellington.
“I’m not sure yet,” he added. “I’m just looking to this game on Friday – a huge one for all of us. It’s a ‘final’, and set up brilliantly in Wellington.”
It does not appear likely, either, that Buttler will be pushed up the order from number six, where he hit nine fours and a towering six in Tuesday’s 28-ball half-century.”
It is a recipe which did not work for England in Hamilton on Tuesday as they fell well short of requirements, after Black Caps captain Brendon McCullum hit 74 from 38 balls. But Buttler insists they are capable of returning to the level of performance which saw them win the series opener by 40 runs.
“From the game in Auckland, where we played brilliantly, it was a bit of a role reversal,” he said.
“We didn’t play to the best of our ability. We know that, but we put that behind us and look forward to putting in a really good performance in Wellington.
“They’re a dangerous side with some quality Twenty20 players. McCullum played really well, and I thought they bowled brilliantly at the top.
“Those early wickets really put you on the back foot in Twenty20. But we’re very confident for Friday.”.”

Hope Award | South Regional winner: Beltline gives kids a chance to earn a bike and learn a work ethic
ATLANTA—Razor wire tops the fence that encircles the industrial building that houses the Beltline Bike Shop. Only a small yellow sign signals the shop’s existence on the edge of the Adair Park neighborhood in southwest Atlanta.
Inside, though, the vibe is vibrant. A small screen plays bike videos to a rap accompaniment. Grafitti-style bubble letters in yellow, orange, and purple spell out the shop name on one wall. Owner Tim O’Mara splits his attention between a man trying to pry a tire off a rim, and an elementary-school student named Justin examining donated bikes.
“Mr. Tim, I’m afraid about this one,” Justin says of a 20-inch bike with a loose chain: “A little kid riding it and goes too fast—it’ll pop off.” Justin wants to fix it and O’Mara tells him what tools he’ll need, then moves on to his next task. In the next half-hour O’Mara or his wife Becky circles back to Justin several times, checking to see how the repair is going, offering help where needed, and engaging him in conversation.
On a typical Saturday afternoon, that dynamic happens repeatedly with dozens of kids who come and learn how to fix bikes, experience the connection between hard work and rewards, and interact with adults who are good role models. The shop’s slogan: “Building community, one bike at a time.”
Beltline had its informal start in 2008 when the O’Maras moved to Adair Park, a neighborhood of inexpensive Craftsman-style bungalows and tall trees. Neighborhood problems with drugs, gangs, and litter did not deter them. Becky, now 31, worked in children’s ministry at a local church, and Tim, 41, owned a video production company. They wanted to be good neighbors but had no plan to “do ministry” in the neighborhood.
One day they were walking their dog in a park across the street from their house. They saw a girl they knew who owned a bike but wasn’t riding it because it had flat, worn-out tires. The O’Maras were casual bike riders and Tim was mechanically inclined, so they offered to help fix the bike if Brittany would do some chores around their house to pay for the new tires and tubes. After about three weeks, they said that was enough and would pick up the parts. It turned out, though, that a new bike cost just $10 more than the repairs. When they presented the new bike to Brittany, she “was over-the-moon excited,” Becky said: After that “every kid was our new friend.”
From their front porch overlooking the park, the O’Maras had watched young kids hanging out with older teens who were “making bad choices.” They saw an opportunity to build relationships naturally through bikes. They’d also noticed how neighborhood kids had an expectation of free things. “We weren’t going to have that,” Becky (now known as Ms. Becky) said. “That’s not how we grew up and we didn’t want to become that. We wanted to be a neighbor.” So they decided to find a way for kids to earn bikes.
The O’Maras began putting word out to families in the church where Becky worked: If you have bikes you’re outgrowing, we’d be glad to take them off your hands. As bikes came in, the O’Maras invited kids to earn them, but only after introducing themselves to the families. They gave kids chores to do. When they ran out of odd jobs at their house, they set kids to work picking up trash in the local park. Litter was such a problem, Becky said, that kids could walk around the block and easily fill up four large trash bags.
They learned that bikes fostered long-term relationships. Once kids owned bikes, they came to the O’Maras for help with flat tires and loose chains. Before long on Saturday mornings, Becky said, “our driveway looked like an old parts junk yard with 20-30 kids repairing their bikes or helping others.”
The O’Maras kept the bike program low-key, wanting to maintain natural, neighborly relationships with children. Before kids could earn a bike, the O’Maras tried to meet their parents or grandparents. If kids had to use a bathroom, the O’Maras sent them home to do it.
They saw benefits: The park was cleaner and more kids were outside riding bikes. Adults in the neighborhood took an interest in what the kids were doing and learned their names. Becky says the bikes became a way for neighbors to connect: “As we’re out and about, talking to our friends, we’re introducing them to kids. Most kids in the neighborhood know four to 10 adults they see on a regular basis.”
By 2010, the bike project had grown so much that the O’Maras converted it to a nonprofit and moved operations from their driveway to its present location. Beltline is officially open Mondays, Wednesdays, and Saturdays and has become Tim’s full-time job. So far, kids have earned 257 bikes, repaired 2,744, and picked up 830 bags of trash.
As Justin works on the bike with the loose chain, he explains what he’s doing: “I’m tightening the bolts on the bike so the bike will be able to go good.” When he thinks the chain is tight, Ms. Becky tells him to take it for a test drive. Justin hesitates: “If the front tire pops off, I’m going to be in big trouble.” Better check it again!
Across the room, Joe—several years older and able to handle more complicated repairs—puts his bike on a rack: “I need some brake pads and front brake pads.” From time to time, Mr. Tim comes by to see how Joe is doing and give instructions: “You can’t force it. OK, now pull it out.”
Donated bikes carry numbered stickers showing the value in stars of each bike. Stars are the shop currency. Each hour of work equals one star, and everything costs something. If a kid gets a flat tire and needs a patch, it costs either money or time. With stars, kids can buy new tires or tubes and extra stuff like locks, lights, and bells. So when kids like Justin or Joe come into the shop, they work to earn stars. They can also earn stars by picking up trash and helping neighbors.
Kids take their developing work ethics into the neighborhood. During spring break, the O’Maras noticed many 12-, 13-, and 14-year-olds out looking for jobs—walking dogs, cleaning houses, digging ditches, digging gardens. Tim said it’s a “natural result of earning bikes.”
Outside the shop, some of the kids have chaotic lives. Inside, they operate by Bike Shop rules, which are posted on the wall: “I will not deceive, cheat, or steal. I will be kind and forgive others.
I will not tell false stories. I will respect my parents and tell them where I’m going. …”
Tim O’Mara explains the shop ethos: “They’re children. Somebody has to be the adult. I’m the adult. I draw a line. They need that, though. They need discipline. They need structure. When they have it, they thrive. That’s how the bike shop operates: It’s very strict and they operate well in it.”
Kids still come to the O’Maras’ house, but they don’t fix bikes on the porch anymore. Some of the long-term kids even get to go inside. That leads some kids on the fringe to ask, “Why can’t I come in?” Tim’s blunt answer: “I don’t know your momma. That’s it. Sorry.”
Over the past four years, the O’Maras have seen three kids deal with a parent’s death from drug abuse, violence, or disease. Those tragedies, Becky says, provide “a unique time to minister to the family, to talk about life after death, reliance on God in difficult times, and where healing comes from.”
They’ve also seen kids they know make heartbreaking choices. As neighbors, they try to make a difference. “Tim was made for a neighborhood like this and kids like this,” Becky says: “His abrasive, natural personality [suits] the boys in this area. They love him.”

You must be a WORLD member to post comments.When the Persians assaulted the Spartans at Thermopylae in an attempt to add Greece to their empire, only 300 battle-hardened warriors stood in the way of Xerxes’ will. Of course, the Persian King thought he was a God, and that is why he failed.
Before the 2008 election, both McCain and Obama made appearances at a traditional Manhattan dinner where they made fun of themselves. That was nice. I remember Obama’s joke about himself. “My strongest suit is my humility. And where are those Greek columns I requested?” I’m sure he didn’t have Sparta in mind.
The man is a self-proclaimed sufferer of hubris. Whether you voted for him or not, the hype was very obvious, the excitement, the hope, the hope for change, the anticipation. Obama built himself up to be Superman. Everything was going to change. As Charles Krauthammer wrote in his column last month, Obama has never been overly modest about his own powers. He declared that history will mark his ascent to the presidency as the moment when “our planet began to heal” and “the rise of the oceans began to slow.”
Well, sea levels are still rising, but not because of melting ice caps. Now it’s because of gushing crude oil.
This of course is not Obama’s fault. What happened, happened. Now it has to be taken care of as best as humanly possible. The problem is, ever since Obama claimed to be Superman in his election campaign, he has made this into his fault by taking the responsibility of a God even before he took office. Now he has to maintain that image, and the only thing he can actually do is send in Attorney General Eric Holder to see if he can sue BP. He can also talk about “whose ass to kick.”
If he were a more modest man, perhaps the American people would take this situation more rationally rather than take it out against their president, but when you tell people you’re Superman and all the sudden you can’t fly, people get mad and stop voting for you.
But the environment is not the only thing Obama prophesied that he would heal. He would also heal, by the force of his sheer personality, the Israeli-Arab conflict. Now, some people say Obama will back off and let things take their course in Israel, realizing he’s asking too much. Others say he will intensify his involvement.
The latter group is correct, for the following reasons. First, one failure does not stop a man suffering from hubris to suddenly understand that he can’t actually fly. He feels he is personally able to bring peace to the area, and he will not let go of that fantasy. His failure in the gulf that he set up for himself will only make him more intent on succeeding by sheer force of will somewhere else.
Secondly, and more importantly, Obama is a cultural relativist. He doesn’t believe that there is a good side and an evil side in any conflict. He has the standard left wing universalist dream of everyone suddenly realizing that they are all the same and respecting each other. There is only misunderstanding—not good or evil. Solve the misunderstanding, solve the conflict, and achieve the left wing universalist dream.
But even as a cultural relativist, he is still essentially Western, and therefore can only culturally communicate with the Western side of the conflict, which is of course Israel. Friends of Israel often wonder why Obama only pressures Israel. The answer is, he has no choice. There is no one else to pressure because the Arab side does not have Western values. They have Muslim values, and who can blame them? That’s who they are.
In Obama’s mind, it goes like this: All cultures are the same and conflict is caused by misunderstanding. Pressuring a culture that is not your own promotes misunderstanding, and therefore conflict. Therefore, I must only pressure Israel.
And as the sea levels continue to rise with black muck and Obama’s poll numbers continue to drop with the rising seas, Israel will feel the slow, creeping tides. At some point, though, Israel will recognize that she, as the Jewish state, is the only one that is destined to be the moral compass that the world is so desperately looking for. When she realizes that, she will no longer be simply a Western colony that took over Palestine, but a Jewish State with her own Jewish culture that will no longer be able to be pressured by a cultural relativist in the West.

INDIAN HEAD MOUNTAIN
Your face stares ahead, stoic
Chief Big Tree head
on the Indian nickel,
minted in granite.
What do you see
above our Adirondack fjord?
Children playing in Indian Cove,
war canoes ambushing enemies
unawares? Nimble legs, thin
as saplings, clambering first trails
to touch the crown of your forehead?
Coke cans in the bushes?
Fighter planes screaming
past Mt. Colvin and the Range?
You stand as sentinel to all this,
watching as guide boats
beat their wooden wings
against white-capped water.
They push against an invisible wall
that shoves them back again.
Perhaps, even now,
you are praying
immutable words, mouthed
only by the wilderness wind,
"Go back. Leave no trace
behind. This holy ground
belongs to no one."
Pamela CranstonA controversial court ruling in eastern Switzerland inspires our Geo Quiz.
The ruling is about an "eternal flame" that's been burning for more than 600 years.
It's inside a church in a town nestled in the Swiss Alps. The church's spire looks out over the Linth River in the Swiss canton of Glarus.
The church has proudly kept that flame burning since 1357, though it seems many local residents don't remember why.
It has to do with a murder case. A 14th century murder case involving neighbors.
One more thing: the killer was a local farmer with lots of walnut trees on his property.
Sorry that's it for clues.
Now here's the rest of the story: A recent Swiss court ruling has released a farmer from an obligation, dating back 655 years, to finance an "eternal lamp" in the local church in Näfels (the answer to our Geo Quiz!).
The debt arose from a 14th century murder case in which one man was accused of killing a neighbor. To atone for his crime, and to avoid vengeance from the family of his victim, the killer offered to pay for a lamp in the church "for eternity". But the ruling wiped the slate clean and nullified any ongoing obligation dating back to the medieval era case. So what's the fate of the "eternal flame"?
Andrea Looser, a journalist with Südostschweiz (south east Switzerland) newspaper says Näfels residents have already stepped forward to keep the lamp burning.Doris Louise Irvin (83) of Jacksonville

13.Most people know that the best protection from the flu is an annual flu shot – but when and where to get the flu shot are frequently asked questions.
“Any time you get a flu shot is better than not getting a flu shot, but my best guess is that getting your flu shot in mid-October will give you the best chance of avoiding the flu this year,” says Jorge P. Parada, MD, a professor of medicine and director of the infection control program at Loyola University in Chicago.
Why Early Is Not Better
You might hear pharmacies advertising that they have the flu shot now, so you should come in early. The problem is that protection from an early flu shot may not last through the whole flu season. “We call it waning immunity,” says Dr. Parada. “If you get your flu shot in the beginning of September, you may start running out of protection by February or March, when the virus is still around.
Of course, it's difficult to predict when the flu will start and stop from one year to the next. Flu usually peaks in the winter, but it may still be around into April or even May. “If you look at flu seasons over many years, you will see that infections consistently peak in January and February," Parada says.
Any Time Is Better Than Never
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends getting a flu shot as soon as it becomes available in your community. That’s because flu season could strike as early as October, and it takes about two weeks for the shot to work.
“It’s not an exact science," Parada says. "Any time is better than no time."
He also says to remember:
- Late is better than never. If you procrastinate about getting a flu shot until January, there's still time to get one. You will still be protected for the majority of the flu season.
- Getting a flu shot after having the flu still counts. If you wait too long and get the flu before you get a flu shot, don’t assume you won’t get it again. “There are always three or four major strains of flu going around," Parada says. "Getting one strain may not protect you from the others. A flu shot after the flu is still a good bet."
- You can always get a booster. If you're older than 65 and got the flu shot early, you can get a booster if the flu is still raging in March. “It could be a good idea for seniors to consider," he says. "Seniors should ask their doctors about it."

Does It Matter Where You Get Your Flu Shot?
There was a time when almost everyone got a flu shot at the doctor’s office. Now there are more places to get vaccinated than ever before, according to Carol J. Baker, MD, FAAP, FIDSA, a professor of pediatrics, molecular virology, and microbiology at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas, and chair of the Childhood Influenza Immunization Coalition.
While Dr. Baker says young children should be vaccinated at their doctor’s office, the best location for you depends on your personal preference. Here are some popular places:
If you’re traditional…head to your doctor’s office. According to CDC statistics, the doctor’s office is still the most common place to get a flu shot.
If you’re spontaneous…stop by a local clinic or health center. While some clinics schedule appointments, you can generally walk in and get a flu shot without one.
If you like to multitask…get vaccinated at the pharmacy or supermarket. Shop for holiday gifts, pick up milk, and get a flu shot all in one stop. Now that all 50 states allow pharmacists to administer the influenza vaccine, Baker notes, getting a flu shot at pharmacies and supermarkets is becoming increasingly popular.
If you’re forgetful…sign up for a shot at work. Many companies organize flu shot days at the workplace.
If you like things fast…go to a drive-thru. Believe it or not, some health departments across the country offer drive-through flu shot clinics. “People can get their flu vaccine by just driving up and rolling down the driver’s seat window,” says Baker. “You don’t even have to leave the car.”
If you’re always traveling…get vaccinated at the airport. Stuck with a long layover? Put it to good use. You can get a flu shot at clinics or kiosks at airports in about a dozen U.S. airports, including Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, and Orlando.

Last Updated: 8/13/2014Apple announced yesterday that there have been more than 25 million songs downloaded from the iTunes Music Store (iTMS). According to Apple, the 25th million song was Frank Sinatrais version of "Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!" That song was downloaded on Friday.
Apple also announced that more than a million dollars in iTMS gift certificates and allowances have been purchased since their introduction on October 16th. "Allowances" allow parents to put money into an account for their kids to use to purchase songs without a credit card, while gift certificates are just what they sound like.
Whatis perhaps most important about this announcement, however, is the fact that Apple says it is seeing 1.5 million downloads per week from the iTMS. That pace not puts Apple on track to sell 75 million songs a year, it also puts Apple squarely in the lead in the battle for online music distribution. From Appleis press release:

In a matter of two weeks, South Sudan was at the edge of the apocalypse. The insanity that continues in many places to date negates completely the spirit of solidarity and unity of purpose South Sudanese demonstrated to world on January 9th 2011 and which reverberated on July 9th at independence.
This horrible development forces on each of us to lower head in shame in the same manner our fellow citizens quickly identified themselves as American, British, Canadian, German and Australians to enable them get into the planes evacuating foreigners.
No situation remains the same. The insanity was bound to end somehow. The people of South Sudan were encouraged by the news emanating from Addis Ababa that the parties to the conflict had initialled the agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities.
My first reaction is that this was a significant breakthrough and we commend the IGAD Mediators. It is a step towards unravelling the underlying political difficulties in the SPLM. However, like any other political agreements, the test lies in the implementation.
A priori, three factors work against any meaningful results.
1. President Museveni of Uganda through his numerous statements on the internal situation in South Sudan has declared his intention to defeat Dr. Riek Machar, the leader of the SPLM Opposition. This has weakened IGAD as a neutral broker in the conflict.
President Museveni has troops deployed in South Sudan especially in Jonglei, Unity and Upper Nile states. He has military transport planes and helicopter gunships in South Sudan and two weeks may not be enough for him to withdraw his forces, if he obliged.
The question of who will foot the bill of Ugandan intervention may make Museveni to drag his feet or completely refuse to recognise the agreement on Cessation of Hostilities. This creates a condition for Bashir to intervene and complicate the whole process.
2. President Salva Kiir lacks political good will and may develop cold feet and delay the implementation of the agreement by insisting on his discredited story of a coup as a ploy to keep detaining the SPLM political leaders.
Salva Kiir is not that leader who swallows his pride. He knows that releasing the eleven detained political leaders would be a boast for Riek Machar and the SPLM Opposition.
President Salva Kiir may be afraid of the people around him who pushed him into this situation. He may try to twist the hands of IGAD Mediators to delay the implementation until he and Museveni complete their project of retaking all the ground from under the feet of Riek Machar.
3. The third and the most dangerous factor is the bitterness and urge of vengeance expressed by many Nuers, some of who witnessed the massacres in Juba. The danger with this stems from the likelihood of disobeying the orders of Riek Machar.
It is a fact that the rebellion of Peter Gadet (Bor) and James Koang (Bentiu) were spontaneous in response to the massacres in Juba. Dr. Riek Machar did not order them and even when he assumed the leadership, Riek Machar knew that these military officers acted on their own. Similarly, the White Army (jiech mabour) acted with their hearts rather than minds.
Assuming that the Monitoring and Verification Teams (MVT) will be set up and the implementation of the agreement precedes according to the letter and spirit then definitely the IGAD Mediation process shifts to tackling underlying political causes. This will by no means be simple.
The SPLM has always been the problem to the point I said sometimes ago that the SPLM must be saved from itself before it plunged South Sudan into the abyss.
The problem of the SPLM stems from its history of extreme militarism and lack of political ideology and organization. ‘Militarism’ is what military action degenerates into when envisaged and executed outside the context of its political purpose, to paraphrase Debray. The history of the SPLM/SPLA reveals the astounding reality of dissociating the military and political functions that has now led to the mutilation of both institutions. This led to a distortion of its development trajectory as a national liberation movement.
The lack of political ideology and organization registered in the failure to build democratic institutions in the SPLM reflected in dysfunctionality of the SPLM led government of South Sudan since 2005.
The SPLM adopted archaic ideology, which promoted Dinka ethnic dominance and hegemony in all aspects of social, economic and political life of the country. Promoting ethnic ideology in a modern state constitute a serious contradiction and this explains the SPLM failure to build accountable instruments of governance since 2005.
The tragic death of Dr. John Garang in 2005 at a time the SPLM had just thrust itself onto unfamiliar domain of governing compounded the predicament of South Sudan. What we saw on January 9th, 2011 could not, seriously speaking, be counted on the political work of the SPLM. The people demonstrated their anger with north Sudan and therefore voted to become independent.
The SPLM under the leadership of General Salva Kiir Mayardit failed in nine years to stamp its vision on the reality of South Sudan. It was a leadership style very close to his village in Akon and conditioned by the ethnic/clan politics, in which ethnic and clan leadership took centre stage in the affairs of the state.
For the first time in the SPLM, we heard of ‘Bahr el Ghazal elders’ making a ring around Salva Kiir’s leadership of South Sudan. In this respect, Dr. John Garang was an angel because he surrounded himself with South Sudanese people from all walks of life even the then Bor Mafia found it difficult to influence things in Garang’s court.
Salva Kiir’s leadership configuration was the very unmaking of South Sudan. It clipped the SPLM wings preventing its transformation from a liberation movement to a progressive political party.
The government of South Sudan operated without programme and clear objectives. The only means of institutionalization was ethnic or regional. We would hear of serious crimes committed and yet nobody brought to books especially if the culprits hailed from Dinka Rek of Gogrial and Awiel.
President Salva Kiir’s zero tolerance to corruption stopped when it came nearer home. The President surrounded himself with people from his home turf who virtually transformed South Sudan into a limited liability enterprise, which informalized the state institutions to facilitate the looting of its resources.
President Salva Kiir’s leadership of South Sudan conditioned by the menagerie politics of Dinka Rek animals of Gogrial and Awiel (Awan, Agwok, Apuk and Kuach) was bound to generate serious problems. The current civil strife is a proof that this leadership has a narrow base and therefore cannot meet the aspiration of all the people of South Sudan.
This brings me to the question of ‘what should be done’ to get the country moving again. What pops up is the intricacy of the situation, which tells us that we require multi-layered solutions, and that we should stop thinking ‘inside the box’.
First, although the underlying political contradictions were essentially internal to the SPLM only that now it acquired a national dimension, which renders it doubtful to resolve in the context of maintaining the status quo.
Perhaps had President Salva Kiir not resorted to military action on December 15th, 2013, the then political discourse within the SPLM would have resulted in a peaceful split into two factions. That stage has been overtaken by the violence and mass killings.
Secondly, any thinking along the lines of holding the election in 2015 is not realistic. It would mean restarting afresh the conflict ended by the agreement on cessation of hostilities.
South Sudan will remain in state of conflict unless something radical is constructed. This radical something must factor in the international context of South Sudan.
South Sudan became independent under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter vide UN Security Council Resolution 1966 of July 8, 2011. In a space of two years, the fragile state slided into anarchy and chaos, making its failure almost complete.
There is no national army; what we have are ethnic troops. The state institutions of governance and law and order including the Judiciary have lost their national character. The internal legitimacy of the state has been challenged and this automatically affects its sovereignty.
To salvage the country we need to think outside the box. There would be need to forgo sovereignty for a period of five years during which the sovereignty of South Sudan reverts to UN stewardship under revamped UNMISS mandate. This would require deployment of a huge multinational UN force to undertake the complete disarmament of the armies and the civil population.
In the five years period, establish government of technocrats and professional with the assistance of some African countries like Ghana, South Africa, Tanzania, etc.
This government of technocrats under the stewardship of the UN to be tasked with reconstruction of South Sudanese state and to establish its institutions of governance:
• Build a new depoliticized and professional new army comprising all the ethnic communities of South Sudan and imbued with national values of patriotism;
• Build a depoliticized, professional new police force and security organs;
• Build a professional depoliticized civil service;
• Build professional and depoliticized local government very close to the people;
• Build the physical infrastructure or roads, schools, hospitals, electricity and hydroelectric power generation; undertake extensive political education and enlightenment to raise the social awareness and political consciousness that in five years the citizen in South Sudan is informed of their rights and responsibilities;
• Build a robust economy developing and exploiting the vast natural resources of South Sudan especially in agriculture, livestock, forestry, fisheries, etc;
• Build the necessary political infrastructure in terms of procedures, regulations and laws that guide the organization and action of political parties.
These are points for discussion, which require further research. Many people are very hostile to the idea of sovereignty reverting to the UN but they cannot provide answers for unlocking the situation posed by the existence of a failed state and the ongoing civil war in the country.
I believe the oil revenue could be used to fund the process, which emphasizes accountability and transparency in the use of these resources to create accountable system of government. At least it would be better than continued strife and the emerging situation of war of all against all.
Peter Adwok Nyaba
Juba, January 25th, 2014
Dr. Adwok, you’ve been strong supporter and great participant of SPLM/A movement since inception. You strongly argued and fought along side people who were eliminatinting freedom fighters. I am surprised, you’re not genuine.
Nyaba,
Since when did failures by a bunch of bloodthirsty hooligans become a failure of the people of South Sudan? South Sudan will need help from the UN, help to shipped all savages to the Hague, locked up and the keys given to Lucifer, the chiefguard in hell. Generations fought many years for the freedom of this country and we are not about to let a few gangs of idiots like u take it away from us. The Nuer and all others under arms will eventually lay down their weapons in the name of peace becasuse South Sudan will one day hunt down all the perpetrators of violence and bring them to justice. It is naive to think that those chesttrumping today will always remain in that position.
Nyaba, if mutinies by Peter Gadet (Bor) and James Koang (Bentiu) were spontaneous in response to the massacres in Juba, why did Riak owned it. Had Riak been genuine, he would have disassociated himself from the rebellion by the two, called any media house from his hideouts and demand for a UN sanctioned investigation into the atrocities in Juba. Do u know why he did none of this? He slipped out of Juba with relative ease to organise his part of the army for full scale war. Those now languishing in jail are innocent victims by association who must be released. By keeping them jailed, Kiir is giving confirming a martyrdom status to people who are not a thread.
Ugandans sheltered our people and helped us fight a successfull war of liberation. There is no country that sacrificed so much like Uganda for our freedom. No South Sudanese blamed Uganda when they were helping us fight Bashir. Their presence helped keep the war far away from Equatoria and Juba. Bashir can intervene to broaden the war as u seem to suggest on Riak’s side. The mobilisation called for by the governors of Equatoria was a desperate attempt to keep out a spillover. Equatoria has no tribal army to revenge against the killings of her people. The UPDF is welcome to help secure the war from spreading. I can understand why people like u who had expected the war to expand are against the presence of the UPDF.
Nyaba, the SPLM as a party in governance is a failure. U, Kiir, Riak and all other idiots not mentioned here are all looters. There is no saint among u. U were all in government. Dictator Kiir is ur making. He could remove an elected governor because a parliament and cabinet made up of idiots gave him the power in the constitution. It is time the opposition mobilise for the next election. Those disgruntled elements within the SPLM can also take their grivanceies to the electorate. Why would u like to think that the electorate is stupid. It is the elites like u in the SPLM who are fools.
I don’t think Riek Machar will put his feet in Juba again.He has to wash PHD again METHINKS.
Beek, government’s forces break the ceasefire deal again and again. They can not be truth since they are being guided by this mindless Kiir.
Don’t count on it. A Smart men like you would not say such a thing especially when the one you insult is still armed.
Kiir only controls towns. I ask who controls the entire country side. What is the guarantee that these overstreched Kiir militia can hold to the places they hold? Only God knows of the fate of this nation.
Dear Dr Nyaba
Thank you for your insightful piece. While I clearly see your point I am afraid I do not buy it. My reason is this: South Sudan has a lot of very competent people who can run the country smoothly with the interest of the people of South Sudan at the heart of it. The fact that SPLM/A has failed does not mean that South Sudan has failed. It is a known fact for anybody who dared to look that SPLM/A was a tribal joint and a disaster waiting to happen. Now that the awaited disaster has happened we should actually think of handing the country back to the competent leaders of South Sudan and not to UN. So, in the coming National Dialogue in Addis Ababa we must ask president Kiir to step down for a transitional government of national unity to prepare the country for the first legitimate elections of RSS. The suggested transitional government must not include president Kiir or Riek Machar. It must be led by a neutral wise and competent person who understands that South Sudan is a diverse society with multiplicities of cultures and ethnicities that must be balanced and respected to foster peace and development. Professor Laura Nyantung Beny and Dr John Mairi Blackings have provided good ideas in their recent letter to Mr Donald Booth which could be used as a template by the transitional government. Nevertheless your piece is very helpful in encouraging debate outside the box.
Paul,
Rest assured that majority of South Sudanese are behind President kiir and would not buy the idea of him stepping down for what ever system you preach about. He ( president Kiir) fully understands the diversity of the Republic of South Sudan and that is why he has been throughout his time in office working tirelessly to bring all components of the nation’s contradictions on board the “Murkab”. Which leader in Africa have you ever seen behaving like a religious leader who wants each and everyone, former enemies included, to have a say in the running of the affairs of the nation? Is it not for being inclusive that the SPLM in Opposition is accusing him of binging into the government former NCP members and their militias into the National Army, the SPLA? What more understanding of the diversity of the people of South Sudan than this do you have in mind? I am not an SPLM member but let me assure you that the mighty SPLM whose sons and daughters are trying to destroy, will keep on steering this nation to the heights of prosperity whether people of your kind like it or not. People of South Sudan are not short sighted to quickly forget the long struggle of mighty SPLM for the freedom some are trying to jeopardize nowadays.
Dear Gat
You can remain in your cocoon but the king is naked and the writing is on the wall. Kiir must go.
Dear Paul
I am looking at things in a wider perspective where I see kiir in glamorous power attire.writing on the wall on my side says Kiir must go through a right channel, which is elections in 2015 and may be 2020.
Dear Gat
Do you know that Kiir did not come to power through election? He is a fraud who assumed power and he needs to step down now. Some of us are now determined to demolish the myth that Kiir’s government is an elected government. Watch this space – Kiir will be undressed/unclothed properly. We can not have an ethnic cleanser as a president. Period
The right channel is too late for him otherwise you are enjoying what is happening now in our country which is out of Kiir’s control.Assure you that Most nationalists in RSS just opt for Kiir stepping down for best of our young country! Those fews opting him stay are only scavengers around his backyard!
Gat,
This name does not belong to you and it is does not fit you in anyway. Use you Gorial name instead of hiding behind Nuer name. When you said “Majority are behind President Kiir” I am assuming you mean majority of Ugandians being forced to be behind Kiir without their consent. As sure as night follows day, only blind supporters of Kiir like yourself are behind President Kiir. The majority of pure South Sudanese are not behind him. If they were, he won’t have brought Ugandian people to his defend. This majority you are talking about would have easily defended him.
Thus, it is time for you to accept the truth. Let us wait and see what the end result of Addis Ababa will be.
Dear Dr Peter Adwok,
If I must ask you, why is it now that you are out of the government of president Kiir that you are complaining of its under performance and all those you are labelling against the same government you had been a minister for eight years? Such attitudes of one advocating for what serves his/her interest are what are setting our nascent country back. I do agree with you asserting that the government has not been able to perform up to our expectations. However, I don’t blame all those shortcomings on president Salva Kiir individually but rather on his cabinet members and as such you are not a pure angel because you had been part of this mess. You were a minister of Higher Education for eight years and since then you did not only fail to start a single mark of reform in the ministry policies but also you messed up the little good things that you found in place. So Dr Adwok: you and your likes should just hold your tongues instead of reminding us of your rotten legacies.
Dr.Adwok,
You and Nyandeng, appear to give information that gives a lot of details and reasons for people to think. Dr. Alhag does not buy your story and he is convinced there are many people in South Sudan who can govern. Many people will agree with him, including those who are seeking political positions to earn their living. On the face of it, there are many educated people in South Sudan, including yourself. One day, I was joking with some friends who tried to ridicule South Sudanese as uneducated. I was able to point to them in 2004, that among so many rebellions in the world, there were very few or none at all, whose leadership had people with PHDs like was the case of South Sudan. That time it was Dr. Garang, Dr. Riak, Dr. Lam Akol, Dr. Justin Yak, etc, etc,. But today, we are in this situation again and the world is saying the people in South Sudan do not know how to govern themselves.
I think, you need to look at the issue again. This conflict has exposed many assumptions. The assumptions at the national level has been completely exposed. For instance, was it necessary for leaders of the political parties to sign the document on 31.12.13? Some of us would have expected the political parties to research and find out the facts and inform the nation. That way it would provide another view besides what the government is saying so that there is a bit of check and balance. Even the so-called tribalism has been exposed. It has also exposed the regional configuration. Now you have Ugandan boots on the ground and Ethiopia and Sudan saying this is not good. Even Kenyan Parliament saying something which in effect distanced itself from the military intervention of Uganda. And yet East African Parliament meeting in Kampala, giving a go ahead to Museveni. So what is going on all around here? Where is the line of Igad? This regional block, appears to be in some kind of credibility crisis. The international community is also exposed. The language being used is almost what somebody described as moral equivocation. So a person like yourself will help this country by digging deeper to come out with some novel ideas. But what you post are useful for understanding what is going on until now.
The last time Boutrous Boutrous Ghali talked about redefining national sovereignty appeared to be novel. South Sudan’s case means even more imagination. It appears to be the problem in the region of double co-opting of institutions that are, according to modernisation theory, opposed. On the one hand people co-opt the language or narrative of democracy to legitimise their authority. On the other hand, people also co-opt the tribe or tribal narrative to stay in power. Something fundamental needs to change.
Dear Lagu
Respectfully for your information I am not a doctor as I do not hold a Phd.
Kind regards
Dr. Nyaba,
I can not understand why people like you talk of Dinka domination in the politics of the country while you and some of your group members, specially from Collo tribe, were busy nights and days blocking one of your own tribe man, namely Dr. Lam Ako from enjoying his civil and political rights throughout the CPA interim period and after the independent? Why have you and your group started raising dust by the time Dr. Lam put his foot on the soil of South Sudan?
Brother Peter Makuac Manyuat,
the problem in South Sudan politics is that the very same folks who messed up the country are the same people who change their veils in front of the country and start accusing each other when they’re no longer loyal to their individuals interest. They have collectively failed the country. The worse about it all is that, the country lack’s a proper opposition that can be trusted by all people of South Sudan. The one which can lead the nation to unify all toward peace and development among many more expectations. The so called oppositions are just former SpLM members who fell out just like the current Riek’s group, for their selfish interest based on their tribe, clans, etc.
What irritated me about these types of political oppositions in our country is that, their political stand is always inhabited by foreign Nations with their hidden interest and use them as puppets to destroyed us and loot our resources with the help so called UNMISS present on our soil. I wonder how does UNMISS protect civilian when they have policy, “We’re not allowed to Intervene” even if their lives and the ones of those under their mandate are the direct targets. We have witnessed failure of UMISS in Juba, Bor, Malakal, Akobo and Bentieu when their boss called them loud that they were not allowed to intervene to prevent civilians getting killed. May be they want atrocities to be committed so that they use them to intimidate and undermine RSS in the future; also their so called international journalists are the ones who have been diverting political power struggle and labelled it as a tribal war and crisis. Now will the roles played by these arrogant reporters be investigated in this or not?
Dr. Peter A. Nyaba,
You are not telling the truth there except you gave Dr. John Garang credits on how he used to ran his government. You complained that there has been Dinka dominance in the government and said, that there is no national army but ethnic Dinka army. Well, to be honest with you, Dinka dominance is definitely still going to be there even if your boss is taking over. That is because Dinka is being represented in seven states out of ten. Anyway, I know for fact during the War between the south and north Sudan Dinka was dominant although rest of the tribes were taking part in liberation. And today, I don’t know about you and your tribe, but speaking for Nuers is completely different because most of Nuers are in the national army that you are allegedly categorizing as ethnic army and Nuers were holding many posts in the South Sudan government as well. Thanks!”
Dear Adok,
I agree with you on all outstanding issues, but disagree with you on the questions of reverting our sovereignty to the UN. We have the resources, the money and enough qualified professional man power spread around the world that that could return home and help built SS. The following things need to be done if we are to wrest control of our country from the foreigners.
1- Have skilled & qualified immigration officials who can control all entry points and determine the people that comes to South Sudan and the circumstances in which they come.
2- Introduce working visas with conditions to be met.
3- Cancel all the employment contracts of all the greedy and corrupt Kenyan & Ugandan civil servants (mentors) employed in all the public and private institutions throughout South Sudan. Frankly speaking this so called mentors have never made any difference or improved the governance of South Sudan in the nearly ten years of working for our country.
4- Foreigners that are required to work in South Sudan must be on the list of occupation on demand and those with technical know how that can not be found locally.
5- Employment of only those South Sudanese who are qualified in all the various institutions.
6- Recruit only educated Army and security organs that is representative of all the tribes and diversity of South Sudan
7- Recruit only educated Police force that is representative of all the tribes and diversity of South Sudan
8-Empower the judiciary which is impartial and independent not with judges of Telar Ring Dengs type with no legal qualification.
9- One Standard must be set to determine the terms and conditions of employment.
10- People must not be employed on the basis of tribe or Gender where affirmative action is not required.
11- People must be employed because they are the right people for the job and of the content of their character not because his/her relative fought in the bush, comes from particular region or because of connection and friends.
12- Jobs must be strictly for South Sudanese citizens. No favours on the basis that countries who supported us during the liberation years can have automatic employment.
Surely those South Sudanese who have the best interest of our country at heart will agree with me that what I raised above could help remedy the situation we are facing today.
I definitely AGREE with you Mr Joseph,but this will take effect if the tribal king leaves the matter to South Sudanese to elect their transitional leader like it happen in CAR!! If Hundred Joseph are residing and participating in country matter this would have not happened to us!
Elhag Paul, I agree with this post of yours totally. It is criminal for the party to even contemplate the roll back of the citizens’ quest for self-determination after it has spent the last 8+ years exterminating any bright light the country has. It is obvious both sides know nothing about the meaning of democracy or how to go about crafting it. Even small things like investing in the universities and hospital would have gone a long way in developing a healthy, informed constituency. The real truth about our grandfathers and uncles is that they despise any and all internal and lateral competition. They get their power through the gun and through creating structures of deprivation for the common man. They prefer to give token handouts to poor people who come calling but they do not wish to foster environments and institutions where poor people would be able to stand up straight and practice their independence. Our grandfathers and uncles prefer us all to remain on our knees in supplication of them and now, apparently, some vague international community that should, perhaps magically, care more about our future than they do. Our grandfathers and uncles would wish to hand the country over to a corporate conglomeration of foreigners rather than give another South Sudanese the reins. Shame on these socalled liberators, democracy frauds and pretenders. They are burning with narcissism and spite. History has already recorded them.
Dr. Adwok,
I am one of your admirers and I like what you say always because of its objectivity. The December 2013 crisis in south Sudan has been catastrophic, and the dynamism of confusion it caused is huge. It is difficult to salvage the appalling situation in south Sudan as we are drifting slowly to a failed state.
The telescopic overview of south Sudan that you have put forth is a cherished thoughts, good intellectual experience, and when put to practice south Sudan will prosper. But the question is who or which country will waste its resources to help nurse our country to prosperity from its chronic disease of ethnic and tribal competition between the Dinka and the Nuer? What the world have seen is a dangerous country that its people are not interested in development but in tribal power struggle and dominance.
In the seven points you put for the “reconstruction of South Sudanese state and to establish its institutions of governance” you have missed out education. The disease in south Sudan is that majority of the people are uneducated. We are in the bottom of the world second only to Afghanistan and Somali. This has been a setback in development and even if we bring experts from all over the world to build our nation, we still need south Sudanese human resources, educated men and women. You have seen how foreigners in south Sudan who came to help us, for example our neighbors such as Ethiopians, Kenyans, and Ugandans but all proved later to be looters and thieves.
The question is education, we need more educated south Sudanese not foreigners to handle our affairs. We have so many military officers in the country more than any other civilized country in the world, and because of their commitment during the war they fought, and now rewarded with big positions but no academic education. They can not move this country forward because they are very limited, and if we have “tribal troops” today is because they want to protect their inability to uplift our nation. They think that might is still right and that is why they amass themselves with warriors of every kind to scare democracy and shoot those with development minds. The stake is huge in south Sudan because tribalism, ignorance, and egocentricism will continue to draw our nation backward to war.
Peter Adwok was part and parcel of the the current Government of president Kiir, Where was he to give those good advice while he was still serving in Kiir,s Government? Even the education which is very vital to bring awareness to development he was the Minister,What did he do to say the least nothing and nothing and now he is talking what is he talking about now and not when he was active education minister?.
It is better for for those who served in Kiir,s Government to keep mute than to talk nonsense again. Who do they want to please?. They are all Birds of the same feathers
r
Also please tell me just how much a UN Trusteeship would cost the people of South Sudan per month in management fees.
I finally realize what the magician meant when he said ”the last shall be first and the first shall be last.” South Sudan is the last sovereign nation as well as the first country to lose its sovereignty in the new order of nations.
One cannot see any logic other than what you have articulated. UN trusteeship is the way to go for South Sudan as tribal warlords have thrown this country into chaos and forever we must hold our heads in shame! the monjang are running like headless chicken to Uganda, Sudan, Kenya as if the peace in that country is not from other people’s efforts and making.
Dr Nyaba,
Your idea of a UN Trusteeship is gaining currency. I read somewhere that a former US diplomat is advocating the same thing. Like El Hag, I am suspicious of the idea. Remember Namibia trusteeship? The UN handed this to South Africa which proceeded to exploit the natural resources of that country. Apartheid South Africa even carved out an enclave, Walvis Bay, from the coast of Namibia for its ownership in perpetuity. South Africa even defied the UN when it was later asked to give up the trusteeship. After it was pressurized to hand back Namibia, it defiantly continued to hang onto Walvis Bay. It was Madiba (RIP) who later relinquished the bay back to Namibia. In our case, the blue-eyed boy of the UN and the international community in the region, H.E. Yoweri K. Museveni will be our trustee! This is not an idle talk. The UN Secretary General had rushed, at the start of the current crisis, to name Museveni as someone who should mediate the conflict!! But now all of us know what that Munyarwanda is doing in our country.
It is not true that South Sudanese are inherently and fundamentally unable to govern themselves. After the first Addis Ababa peace in the 1970’s, we were able to run this country even better than some of the countries in the region, including Uganda at the time. It was when the “born to rule ” people begun to grab the governance in this country that the difficulties started to kick in, leading to Kokora. At the moment, the same false rulers are the ones subverting the governance of this country.
The solution of an interim government is now widely accepted. However, it is the manner in which it should be brought about which is still in dispute. I have said this before, and I repeat it here again: the democratic forces under Riek Machar should be joined by all progressive South Sudanese (I highly commend Madam Nyandeng for her clarity in condemning Kiir) to overthrow Kiir. If the Libyans, Tunisians, and Egyptians can do this to their dictators, why no us? Once Kiir is out of the way, all participants in the revolution can negotiate the next move. But if we leave Riek Machar to shoulder this responsibility alone, then we must expect another period of anguish in our country.
In conclusion, the trusteeship proposal might be attractive but in our case it holds too much danger to be a solution.
Dear Dr. Nyaba,
Salva Kiir becomes a kind of President, the first stupid President in Africa Continent. Salva Kiir’s legacy has been already destroyed by the people he feeds with national monies and his own people.
I want to send you an award for most helpful innertet writer.
Dr. Adwok
I agree with your suggestions 100%,
putting south sudan under UN trusteeship is the only solution for the generation of south sudanese to enjoy and witness peace in this country, you have excavated every thing we are seeing in this country.
For those who oppose your suggestions are either not in south sudan to witness the building of hegemony or are the beneficiaries of this failed state, who don’t mind the future of generations to come, or both.
Dear Kenneth
Have you ever thought about the millions of lives lost to free South Sudan from the Arabs? If you have, why do you want their sacrifice to be a waste? Have you ever thought that through the UN’s trusteeship programme that South Sudan could be entrusted to the Sudan (Bashir)? Crucially then, why do you not believe in your own ability to run the country? If you suffer from an inferiority complex and want to be managed by foreigners please do not assume the entire population of South Sudan also suffer from your complex. South Sudan has competent and capable leaders who believe in themselves and who have been denied the chance to run the country by Dr Nyaba and his SPLM/A. The failure of SPLM/A and Dr Nyaba to run the country is their own failures and they need to come to terms with it. It should not be used to portray South Sudan as deficient of good leaders. All sound minded South Sudanese will not buy such a self demeaning idea that will only sooth the egos of imperialists. I thought Chromoke above has already sufficiently explained the dangers of Dr Nyaba’s idea.
AdwokElhag/Jas/Keneth/Joseph:
Your ideas are all good. To Adwok, thanks for posting this crucial topic.
I will suggest for interim Govt that should be led by another person apart from Dr Riek and Salva Kiir to prepare the country for 2015 upcoming election. Given the on going genocide between the dinka and Nuer and of course orchestrated by the dinka president Kiir, South Sudan should look for an interim leader from other 61 ethnic community minus dinka or Nuer. I am positive that Dr Riek will agree inot this kind of ideas discussed here except the devil worshiper-Kiir and his nursery pupils he is spoon feeding in his govt.
Secondly, if dictator Kiir refused to step down for another nuetral person to take over, then the post of interim president should be given to the UN and all the points raised by AW joseph be taken into consideration interms of runing the civil servants institutions. There is no way we continue runing the country by one ethnic dominations directly brought from luaks with 99% no qualified papers. Yes, we do have very and indeed very qualified South SUdanese and most were even thrown out from the army in the name of DDR after they fought for this country tirelessly when dinka boys from Suk alarabi were brought to harvest the ready made meal in golden plates just because they belong to the ruling ethnic community.
Third, I will also suggest for Federalism to minimize issues of landgrabing, intimidations, hitehc corruptions and many issues committed by dinka ethnic hegemony though we would continue to have one army and police but should be equally recruited accordning to States like during the anyanya one and it worked very well indeed. In federal govt much authority will be given to our elected Governors to run State affairs without interfearance by the President. Issues like customs, immigration including job opportunities will be handle fairly
This is a good topic.
Dear Elhag Paul,
You could be right. It is a known fact that we have competent people who can run this nation. The problem is, we do not truth ourselves and identifying those competent people is proven difficult. In fact, those who want to see this nation prosper and manage rightly are always killled for the thugs in power do not want them take over the leadership.
The other question is: Where have these competent people been when our nation was and continue to lead in the wrong direction by Kiir and his bling supporters? Why were n’t they critical of this mismanagement and nip this in the bud long before this fiasco started? I agree with you that we have competent people to run this nation, but you should know from now that the competent people you are talking about do not have balls and guts.
Mr. Pan,
I agree with you because education is a key to any development. No country can be developed by fools-uneducated!
“Leaders comes Leaders goes, but SS will remain forever”
Congratulations Dr. Nyaba on your insightful article. Yes, if Dr. Garang is still alive today, I really hope things could changed for the better.I am from Nuer Gajaak and I was in my teen age years when my people fought the SPLA. Every since, I had hard feelings with our movement at the time because I was a victim in 1984-1987. Over years, I became to learned Dr. Garang’s ideology and his leleadership. Therefore, I forgive him as a leader based on his admitted that what had happened in Gajaak was perpetrated by some individuals and it was a mistake. That’s how a leader gains the confident of his people. Given what had happened in Juba, the nation capitol, where one one ethnic group is being targeted by another ethnic group was beyond politics. I tooked all the
Let us protect the name of our country .what has happened is irreversible.
Dr Nyaba,
I am appalled by your suggestions of handing our dear country to UN Trusteeship. South Sudan has competent people who can deliver.
The fact you including some of members of the SPLM government has failed the country, it does not condemn South Sudan to be pushed to the hands of the UN. I thought you could be a wise man with your PhD but unfortunately. your performance is miserable culminating into unfortunate suggestions.
Let us have a transitional government led by technocrats so that we can see the difference.
Kikisik, I am astounded by the empty headedness of our fathers and uncles. Someone floats the term ”capacity building” in one of the silly Cluster Meetings run by the NGOs and the UN, and on cue they all start barking ”capacity building!” and doing backdoor deals to import civil servants from other countries to do the jobs they wish not to allow competent South Sudanese to do. Someone floats the term ”reconciliation” in the Cluster Meetings and our uncles start barking ”reconciliation!” and scurrying around the world to partner with foreigners to miraculously reconcile a citizenry that has been deprived and abused for 8+ years. Someone floats the term ”democracy” and they all start barking ”democracy!” and loading their guns and readying their militias to make sure they get the top job in the land. Someone floats the term ”girl child” and they all start barking ”girl child!” and sign off on some cockamamie program for families to pimp out the education of their girls in exchange for donated, sterilized food. Someone floats the idea of a UN Trusteeship and they all start barking ”Trusteeship!”
In each case, there is no doubt a huge kickback to them. Even before the country split, UNMIS was sketchy. When it became UNMISS it grew even sketchier. The decision to renew the agencies mandate a second time was, I am quite sure, a result of heavy bribes exchanged between individuals.
Our uncles have no clue what any of the the terms of a Liberation movement mean or entail. It seems when they were fighting in the bush, they did not keep themselves educated in the manner of the Eritrean Liberation movement. I despise the weak moral fortitude of our bunch.
Dr Adwok nobody would indeed need this country to be cared for by any neutral body as it has appeared in your note had it not been because of the stage we are now in. Nobody had expected that the south Sudanese that stood up solidly as one body and voted for the independence in Jan. 2011 could be used by shallow minded politicians to turn against one another in the manner seen in the last few weeks. Yes we have a lot of technocrats that are able to manage the country but why is it that they are watching as the country disintegrates in to chaos? Is it not because of the difficulties created by the greedy people that will continue giving more obstacles unless a neutral body starts now to lay the bases for the strong nationhood. we all know it is costly but less than what we shall be going through if not rescued now. A lass if the country is to move foreward then your suggestion is one of the modalities that could save it. I know that different people have already given their negativeness about the international bodies,but if it is not because of our inabilities seen by the products of our work this body would not be focusing on us all the time.Our behaviors towards our people are the ones inviting them to the country not they forcing their way through. Sorry the ground for a better south at this stage badly needs a strong neutral body until the wounds created in the hearts are healed. He who thinks that we can do it our selves now has not read properly the types of the minds of the people who at any cost will continue to be the ones queuing up for any governance which will not produce anything. Dr Adwok spoke from his heart not because he was laid out but because he wants the way forward for the country now.
KIKISIK-
You have said it all. Those who are refusing it are the instigators tribal maniacs and mostly those with fake cerificates because South Sudan will be designing ways for tracking documents for all civil servants from the countries they pretend to have complted their studies
””
Dr. Adwok,
It is a great gist to talk about; sometimes i wonder why there was no warrant has been issued for such unlawful on president Kirr and president Museveni. Whatsoever, president Kirr has done was treason it considers a crime and punishable by law. For ICC to remain mute will merely aggravated the situation in south Sudan. The more time we waste the more lives we lose. To salvage the lives of innocent people such as women, children and seniors: we need Icc to take the action as soon as possible.
To all South Sudanese; I was very impressive with Rebeca Nyadeng’s points during the conference that was held in Juba, Capital City of south sudan on January 27,2014 I was watching it through youtube. The most importantly she has asked president Kiir, “where is the money for our country? And why president Kiir does not allow the Youths to exercise their leadership skills?
Deficit spending:
Rebeca Nyadeng echoed the question to reproach president Kiir “where is our country money goes? no roads, schools, and hospitals?” Where the money goes? The same question everyone should ask himself/herself.
However, my question is why president Kiir fired his thirteen cabins and asked president Museveni to deploy his troops into south sudan simultaneously? This is the main cause of the problem. Once again, if I can ask what did the cabins do to incur such wrath and indignant? Absolutely no answer for it. Yet, some of south Sudanese are bolstering president Kiir with sense of avarice.
Avarice??? Will never takes us anywhere. If president Kiir will not step down.
Medi:
I think you are watching a debate from last year,2013 because Rebecca Nyadeng was not in Juba on January 27th,2014. She left Juba shortly after the failure of their Coup in December,2013. I was surprised to hear you praising Rebecca Nyadeng for asking president Kiir for the money. What money was Nyadeng asking for? Are you aware that Rebecca Nyadeng is on the list of the 75 people who stole money from the Government of South Sudan? What Roads is Nyadeng asking? How many Roads did Nyadeng build in Juba and/or in South Sudan when she was the Minister of Roads? Schools? Rebecca Nyadeng has built a huge private school in Juba. Why did she build a private school instead of the public school so that the poor students can attend it for free? And Where did she get the money to build a private school while she was unable to build a single Road/street and/or school in Juba?
Please check the records before you praise those thieves otherwise you will be disappointed when you know their true colours.
“The truth hurts but it is worth telling it”
Lukudu Gatkuoth Garang! (The living voice of South Sudan’s forgotten Martyrs)
Garang,
I’m not on the ground, but I would like to ask you a question if you can remember precisely the day/date when president Kiir called the National Conference of Spla Board and accused UN of acting like a parallel Government.?” Indeed I was wrong; it was published on January 22, 2014 but not 2013. You also can check it to ensure that it was not a fabricate.
Once again, thank you for your updating me.
Dear Dr. Nyaba,
I must admit I see you as one of the intellectuals and highly placed persons in South Sudan. Had you bring these suggestions at independence and given analysis why your suggestions are valid, may be some of us will take you seriously. You are now writing like a desperate man who had failed his country and its people. The fact that you have failed does not mean that the country must not go forward as an independent state. I expected at your role as a minister of higher education, you would have been an instrument in the hand of the president and the party to which you belong to provide political guidance and ideology. This had not happened instead we found ourselves in crisis which has now become the problem of the president. It could be right that as a president he may bear part of the blame but not the whole blame as many of you seems to suggest. Our greatest problem in South Sudan is that we do not know how to give constructive criticism that provide solutions and when we mess up we want to provide solutions. I believe like you that we should “think out of the box.” However, thinking out of the box does not necessarily mean we must relinquish national independence and integrity. South Sudanese have suffered and they will raise out of the ashes and build a great nation which is only of its kind in Africa and all people will find peace in it. You may most probably ask how will that be done? Let me offer you the following:
I believe the solution is not asking the head of the state to step-down at this stage. We instead need to help him craft a national reconciliation process after which he may chose to retire that will be determine by the South Sudanese people at the ballot. I believe the president needs new ideologues than the ones he has now.
I also believe that none of the so called SPLM in opposition or any other opposition groups in that matter should be isolated. We need an inclusive reconciliation that should be lead by neutral South Sudanese who care for all people. We need to swallow our personal or tribal prides and think of how we can salvage our country out of this crisis with some level of credibility. Consequently we must involve the churches as well. We must not work only through the Sudan Council of Churches. We have to engage the Churches as individuals. During this national reconciliation people must be allowed to speak freely so that we know what really the South Sudanese want for their nation. We have been trumpeting Dinka and Nuer only. Let us all remember South Sudan belongs to more than 65 ethnic groups. It must be clear to us that not all these ethnic groups can have a president to rule the country at one go. There can only be one president at a given time and wherever the president comes from he/she needs to be respected. My problem Nyaba, is that some of us have very degenerating and foul languages while talking about the president as if he is not our president. Regardless, his education or lack thereof the president is the president. He deserves our respects. We are not loyal to anything nor to anyone. No, wonder the colonial masters think we are ungovernable and so said President Omar of the Sudan and we are giving him occasion to be proven right.
I strongly urge the president to realize that as a president he bears responsibility for all his people including those who hate him. As a leader he will be criticized which is good for him. If Jesus was criticized why not him. He must never be intimidated to the extend that people suffer under his rule because of the criticisms he gets. As a leader he must go out of his way and be kind and loving. This will provide a political ground for all to speak and he learns from what people say thus he becomes a wiser leader every day.
I believe also a party problem should remain a party problem. No national institution should serve the interest of any given party either in power or out of power but only the interest nation. The president as a national leader must provide this leadership agenda.
Finally the South Sudanese people must decide if they need an interim government before election or whatever South Sudanese say should carry the day. Therefore, I agree with Dr. that 2015 is just too close for any meaningful election. We must immediately spend time in seeking national solution under neutral auspices. It is only few of us writing here. This is not a representative of South Sudanese. What I have suggested here is in the immediate term and something South Sudanese can achieve without needing to give their national independence. Where we need help of UN and indeed the help of the international community is to build a peace loving and peace thinking generation by building education institutions and all the infrastructures you have mentioned above. Without educating our people there will always be conflicts as people follow their tribal leaders based on tribal allegiance without rationally thinking out for themselves the consequences of the proposed actions.
The only solution to our crisis is formation of interim government with out Kiir and other politicians then our country will prosper.
Mr. El Hag Paul,
For the independent of South Sudan to happen, Dr. Riek worked for it. For the stability of the GOSS, Dr. Riek has a very strong input. For that little development and those weak institutions, it was Dr. Riek.
Now, for democracy and rule of law, Dr. Riek is yet again working so hard for it. To insinuate a transitional government without the champion of democracy and self-determination is like putting the assistant on the captain’s seat. This man devoted his entire life for South Sudan to be a robust country. So any suggestion of denying him leadership based on false alligations of Dr. Lam Akhol and few Bor Dinka will drag our country to abyss and could lead to Nuer People fighting for their own country.
Please know the man for what he stands for, not what his adversaries are alleging.Poster 2.087

Systems Approach for Identifying Transcriptional and Metabolic Changes in Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 During Growth-Phase Transitions

In order to study the complex regulatory network of the metabolically versatile bacterium Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 and to understand its unique respiratory and metal-reducing abilities we integrate metabolite and mRNA measurements from a bioreactor experiment under defined growth conditions with computational analyses of gene expression and flux balance analysis. The growth-phase related gene expression changes in E. coli have been studied in the past; however, not much is known about physiological and transcriptional changes in S. oneidensis when cells pass through exponential, stationary, and transition phases. To examine if transcriptional signatures can help understand these changes, we grew S. oneidensis MR-1 in Lactate-limited minimal medium. Time-course samples from various phases of S. oneidensis growth were subjected to microarray analysis (using Shewanella arrays from Affymetrix). To analyze the transcriptional data, we developed a new reverse engineering algorithm (Dynamic Network Enrichment or DNE) that integrates the causality information contained in a time-dependent gene expression data with steady-state expression profiles. A gene network model is first trained on a large compendium of gene expression measurements from M3D dataset () and then the time gene expression profile is fitted on top of the previous inferred network. The DNE algorithm is based on the assumption that during growth of an organism in a batch culture, the gene expression is continuously modulated at various levels because of changing environmental conditions (i.e. medium composition). DNE predicts the pathways primarily modulated by these external perturbations, highlighting the major transcriptional programs during transition between various growth phases. This approach identifies a total of 289 genes, which are enriched for major transcriptional factors mediating batch growth of S. oneidensis MR-1 in lactate-minimal medium. Other genes identified as significantly affected during growth phase changes include genes recently discovered to be part of lactate utilization machinery (SO1518-SO1521 and SO3460). Furthermore, three major dynamic sub-networks emerged from the condition specific gene-network reconstruction. The first sub-network is enriched for genes involved in the starch and sucrose metabolism, glycogen and nitrogen metabolism, TonB energy transduction system, and two component system genes (glnI, glnG, glnA) regulating the glutamate metabolism in low nitrogen conditions. Genes for glycogen and ABC polyamine transporter were also present in this first component. The second sub-network contains genes involved in chemotaxis signal transduction; the third sub-networks include genes that are part of the transposase system (prophage genes). The information gathered about these sub-networks about majorly perturbed genes will be integrated with metabolite measurements and a flux balance analysis model, with the goal of unveiling the sequence of regulatory mechanisms and metabolic requirements mediating the Shewanella's response to environmental changes in the growth medium.

The bass doesn't have the extension of the bigger models, but it still goes deep, with a fuller upper bass than the others, and the kind of presentation that is often described with the single word 'slam'. It's not the most neutral bass around, but it doesn't boom, and it is surprisingly tuneful.
These speakers proudly continue the reputation that Monitor Audio has built up. There is still something of a debate amongst people when it comes to floorstanders or bookshelf speakers but floorstanders provide more more scale and depth than bookshelves so for me there is no contest. These floorstanders offer a front ported delivery so are not too choosy when it comes to positioning and will therefore cope admirably near a wall without having to worry about booming bass.
These speakers do many things very well, their midrange is quite open and detailed, they deliver bass and depth with aplomb and really exhibit what a bargain they are. The treble is nice and neutral and transients in the music are delivered with real verve and excitement. It is the ability yo capture excitement which makes these speakers ideal for many genres in particular, dance rap and heavy rock music but in truth are true all rounders.
Definitely recommended.- Signs >

The Castle in Midanbury, Southampton, faces an uncertain future after its landlord stepped down amid harsh trading conditions.
The pub may shut in August after which current landlord Michael Warner, 32, said it could follow the fate of other city pubs and become another chain store.
Owners Enterprise Inns has not ruled this out and said it was keeping its options open.
But Mr Warner said the pub’s chequered past has made it difficult for him and sister Charlene to make it a success after taking over four years ago.
He said: “We are gutted that it is going because we feel like we have let people down but we know deep down that it’s not our fault.
“The troubled past was a big factor, which was a shame because it used to be a vibrant community pub. It has been difficult to get people through the doors.”
The pub, which dates back to the 1930s, was targeted in 2007 when a mob of nine youths burst in, armed with a handgun and a petrol bomb, believing their enemies to be inside.
Investigators said it was only down to luck that the bomb failed to ignite and the gunman failed to fire his weapon – saving up to 30 lives. Supermarket giants throughout the country are eyeing up struggling pubs.
A loophole in planning regulations means supermarket chains do not require change of use planning permission.
So far this year Tesco has converted The Woodman in Lordswood Road and The Bulls Eye in Butts Road, Sholing, into its Express stores.
The Co-op has also replaced The Anchor and Hope in Foundry Lane, Freemantle, with a store.

the Woodman on a weekend was always full but it's pub grub was rank.
I would leave my Rugby club & get a lift to the Woodman & it was never empty so why did it shut?
It's getting to the point now these private companies can see a bigger profit from selling it for shops or flats than from selling beer.
they charge the tenant exorbitant rents & then charge over the top prices for the alcohol.
Please let us see Micro breweries open as pubs in this city with lower beer prices & a good friendly clientele

A good pub with a good air extraction system & not catering for the young set can be a good place to go & have a drink & talk to friends.
The ASH campaign & the medical profession have forced up the prices which is wrong as even the doctors admit that drinking in moderation is good for you.
but up go the taxes & rents & instead of the family man & his wife going to the pub to meet friends you only had smokers( majority) then you ban that.
People drink at home now making society less social.
or you see the youth glassy eyed before they go into a pub from the cheap drugs they've taken.
you see more & more accidents where the smell of alcohol can be detected yet they fly through the breathalyser why?
because they'll smoke a joint or pop pills & have a small bottle of beer to cover it then go out & fight or drive.
many believe it's okay to smoke a joint & drive.
bring back reasonably priced pubs or start testing for drugs for lung cancer & all other cancers & you'll be shocked.

Oh, and doctors don't think that a little alcohol is good for you by the way. Not ones that know what they're on about anyway. There has been several poorly designed pieces of research that have come to that conclusion, which have received disproportionate amounts of publicity. The evidence to the contrary is far greater, but is less appealing.

Research was done here & the States & in Europe which proved Alcohol,Porridge & a few other products actually broke down cholesterol in the blood stream.
but if taken in excess alcohol was bad for you so as in most things in life you take it in moderation.
I was trying to say we need to take a big step back in time where the publican brewed his own beer & owned his pub.
then prices could be lower & they wouldn't be getting sold for either shops or flats.

to read that crass comment from cantthinkfone so what if it lowers cholesterol is unbelievable.
a well run pub is an asset to a neighbour hood.in everything we do in life there's a danger to it.drink to much put your health at risk drink moderately enjoy yourself & not be a nuisance to any one & you help keep your health.
I know that excessive eating drinking drug taking is bad for you.
as is driving instead of walking .
this is a pub selling totally legitimate goods yet because of the exorbitant taxes can't make enough profit so is/could become a shop selling dairy produce & cholesterol makers.
As for the tax collect on all alcohol sales & related products this far outweighs the cost of any alcohol related treatments.
as with fags the tax collected was £75billion & the NHS received £34billion treatment cost millions yet they campaigned to ban it?
Drink driving is wrong & it should be zero alcohol reading but the police are now admitting a lot of car crashes are not alcohol but drug related so why do we get these anti pub people on here?
I hope for the regulars this reopens as a family pub

cantthinkofone says...
But you're missing the point entirely. That drinking reduces (or prevents maybe) cholesterol build up, if true, does NOT mean that it is good for you. Alcohol is essentially a poison, and has a significant number of harmful effects. If it has one or two positive effects as well, this doesn't change the fact that OVERALL it is harmful.
Your personal experience is irrelevant I'm afraid. A research study with a sample size of one is pretty meaningless.
People should feel free to have a drink and enjoy it, and they should also be aware that it's not good for them. Neither is pizza, lazing about on the sofa, or living in an urban area, but we do these things because they make our lives more enjoyable and/or convenient. That's fine, it's what makes life a pleasurable experience. I'm not anti-pub, and I'm not anti-having-a-drink. But let's not delude ourselves into thinking it's a tonic.

On the planet Xan, Leena and Taurin race to recover a stolen religious artifact before disaster befalls their world. Their progress is hindered by opponents who will stop at nothing to throw them off course. Only Leena and Taurin can restore stability by locating the sacred relic.
As an archaeologist, Leena is an expert on the carvings left by the ancient Apostles who established the worship of Lothar on her world. When she is assigned the task of locating the missing horn, she seeks aid from Taurin Rey Niris, a mysterious stranger who dresses in black and shades his face like the night.
Taurin understands the secrets of her religion but refuses to share his knowledge, afraid that Leena will turn from him in horror once she learns the truth. Regarding her as his personal angel sent to save his troubled soul, he is desperate to earn her love. Once he wins her, he'll do anything to keep her, even if it means lying to the woman he loves.

I'm currently waiting for editorial feedback on some recent story changes to The Firelight Isle, so in the mean-time, I've been doing daily sketches for illustration ideas. Yesterday I picked my favourite one so far and worked it up into a full illustration! I'm really loving lineless illustration at the moment - the finish on this is quite heavily inspired by cucumber quest, which is an absolutely gorgeous webcomic!
That is new ?
Ah, your lineless style looks wonderful! I particularly like the contrast between the solid colour and the patterns, which seem so prominent in Firelight Ilse too <3 And Cucumber Quest, I love that comic! The artwork is gorgeous, and I love the charming story/ exaggerated characters too
Amazing work!

Cardstock stickers are stickers primarily used for paper crafting. They are heavier in weight than regular stickers and have a nicer look to them. The heavier weight helps achieve a dimensional look on projects without the bulk.
Cardstock stickers resemble die cuts, but they already have adhesive on the back, making them easier to work with. With cardstock stickers being sturdier and heavier than regular stickers, the edges of the stickers can be inked or sanded, giving them a distressed look. Regular, flimsy stickers would not allow this type of altering without tearing or getting bunched up.
Scrapbookers and card makers love using cardstock stickers because of the nice distinct look they give a project. Teachers in schools enjoy using them on student projects, while teachers in church like them for crafts for their classroom and Vacation Bible School. Children seem to enjoy working with cardstock stickers because they are stiffer, making it easier for the child to peel the sticker off the sheet with their small fingers.
These types of stickers can be found in scrapbook stores everywhere. They can be found in the sticker aisle, along with the regular stickers. They can also be found in different sections of the store that have specific scrapbooking companies and their products displayed.
Most scrapbooking companies have their own products from cardstock to patterned paper, and carry embellishments such as brads, eyelets or ribbon. They coordinate their products to represent collections for specific holidays or important events in one's life such as a wedding or graduation.
One of the embellishments a scrapbooking company tends to add in with their product lines are cardstock stickers. These stickers add a nice personal touch to a card, scrapbook layout or any other project. They are relatively inexpensive to purchase and very easy to use.
Cardstock stickers can be produced without a specific connection to any particular product line. They represent different types of vacations, different seasons and different holidays. They are made to celebrate birthdays, different stages in life and can be found in just about any subject a person can think of.
Cardstock stickers can be found in alphabets with many different fonts. These different fonts come in a variety of colors and sizes. They make great titles on layouts, send great messages when used on a card and make any school project stand out. These stickers can be placed on top of one another for height to give a chipboard effect when chipboard is not available. Cardstock stickers make a fantastic addition to any project.

Witnesses said the explosions occurred about two minutes apart. The first blast went off about 100-200 meters from a stage set up by protesters. The second went off near a row of vendors selling anti-government T-shirts in the street. on.
Sunai Phasuk, a senior researcher for Human Rights Watch, said “both sides of Thailand’s political divide use violence and spin to serve their political goals”..
Yesterday’s blast wounded 28 civilians, five of them critically, according to the Erawan Medical Centre. Sunai called on police to find the perpetrators, saying that “up until now, we haven’t seen any serious investigation into these attacks”.

- Sid Meier’s Civilization 3: 2.Lying to the press through a flack is a common-enough Washington transgression. Perjuring yourself to federal law enforcement officers is a jailable offense. Should Weiner take his public relations flunky-told tale to the feds, and appear as eager to hunt down journalists as he had been prior to the scandal, then the public might give his story a listen. But Weiner has developed a case of cameraitis that he had previously been immune to and he doesn’t seem so keen to personally interact with the police.
The seedy public fixation on the private lives of politicians undergoes a role reversal here. Instead of a peeping populace forcing its way up to the bedroom window, a politician has imposed, albeit unwittingly, his private life upon the public space. It’s different that the exposed is also the exposer. But the revulsion felt by the dignified remains the same either way.
Illicit sex is about the only area of bipartisan harmony on Capitol Hill. Whereas Democrats benefitted from the resignation of Craigslist Congressman Chris Lee through a seat pick-up last week, Republicans will not be so lucky with the Indiscreet Tweeter Anthony Weiner. A person prone to broadcasting his every half-developed thought through Twitter is by definition immodest. The shamelessness that prompts the publication of so personal a picture necessarily precludes the possibility of a humiliation-avoiding resignation. For anecdotal evidence of this phenomenon, see Bill Clinton, Barney Frank, Gavin Newsom, and David Vitter.
Weiner benefits from the “D” next to his name. He benefits more from the lockstep partisanship of his New York City district. Whatever vainglory the seven-term congressman possessed prior to attaining federal office, the lack of accountability built in to representing such a deep-blue district has exaggerated it. Live wrong but vote right, and you’re sinecure will stay yours. Had Buffalo-area Congressman Chris Lee possessed the correct the political affiliation, or enjoyed a similar party monopoly among constituents, he might be sitting alongside fellow New Yorker Anthony Weiner in Congress today.
Lee had neither, so he is gone. Weiner has both so he won’t be going anywhere.
As bad as it is to have an inadequately-endowed groin imposter, it could be worse for Anthony Weiner. The congressman’s last name could be Johnson. There’s no telling the sport his political enemies would make of him then.

Law enforcement agencies had been watching the area, in the 12000 block of Martindale - a site Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials say is used for off-loading and distribution for marijuana shipments from the southern border.
Agents and officers saw several vehicles entering and exiting the property, identified by the U.S. Attorney's Office as a heavily wooded 5-acre lot. At one point, four vehicles were seen leaving the site at the same time.
Officers tried to stop the four, and a chase began, the office said. One vehicle evaded officers, while the driver and passengers of another - a black pickup - fled. Authorities found 1,200 pounds of marijuana in the pickup.
A pickup truck Villareal is believed to have driven contained 2,500 pounds of marijuana. Valdez was driving a rented van with 1,500 pounds of marijuana, authorities said.
The two buses were found in open-air sheds on the property.
Saturday's nearly 10-ton marijuana seizure follows the arrest Friday of two men accused of turning a Montrose area property into a sophisticated "grow house."
Houston police seized more than $4 million worth of marijuana plants inside a 1,400-square-foot home, in the 1200 block of West Drew. Tan Nguyen, 30, and Thien Nguyen, 35, have been charged with felony possession and remain in the Harris County Jail.
Agencies involved in the Saturday seizure included U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the Harris County Sheriff's Department, the Houston Police Department and the Pasadena Police Department.
Representatives from those agencies referred calls to ICE. Agency spokeswoman Luisa Deason declined to discuss the scope of the seizure.
Deason also declined to address whether the marijuana had been tracked by U.S. Customs and Border Protection from the border to the Houston area, citing an ongoing investigation.
Thien Nguyen is scheduled to appear in court April 4 and Tan Nguyen is scheduled to appear in court April 2.

First time posting since last night's SECCG, and I gotta say...it's just a shame the way the BCS is set up. Georgia proved last night that they are one of CFB's elite this year and the best bowl games should be reserved for the best teams. Plain and simple.
SC played 3 top 10 teams. Beat one at home, lost to 2 on the road. 1-3
UF played 3 top 10 teams. Beat one on the road and one at home, lost at a neutral site. 2-1.
Plus SC and UF beat f$u and chumpson on the road(top 10 at the time).
If any other SEC team deserves a BCS bid it's UF. The system is messed up though. Hell, this is the 2nd year in a row SC finished in the top 10 and isn't going to a BCS bowl.victorian home in historic district

FORUM: Bilbray no ocean champion
Your post is a little extreme. Just what I'd expect from a mentally challenged Liberal.
I guess you like energy dependency?
You better be prepared for expansion of San Onofre to be tripled in size in the next 10 years.
I've been a registered republican since I was 18. I am 38. Obviously you are offended by the last 3 photos. I used them to demonstrate the real world risk for our beaches and tourism driven economy. We have to decide if drilling off the coast is worth it, especially since the oil will be sold on a world market (the oil pumped off California could easily end up filling gas tanks in the UK and not here).
Whether we drill or not, we'll run out of oil eventually.
Thank you JP for this post. Thank you. And I would think protecting the california coast line from further extraction related impacts to the environment, is actually the conservative approach. The current handwringing over the price of gas and the cost of polluting the atmosphere seems to be just an excuse for the oil industry to access to California coast and Artic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWAR).
brig em on.
A billion barrels of oil may sound like a lot. Problem is, the U.S. burns 20.73 million barrels every day.
The oil deposits off North County will sustain U.S. consumption for a total of 48 days, unfortunately.
To quote Stephen Leeb: ". . . unless we can figure out how to power our economy with non-fossil fuels, looming energy shortages will wreak major havoc to our way of life."
On one hand, it is my understanding that offshore rigs are much safer than the one that failed off Santa Barbara 40 years ago. No oil was spilled during Katrina. We need to do something quickly to stop energy prices from continuing to spiral upwards. The working poor are the ones who are truly hurting commuting at $5 / gal.
Conversely, I recall getting home from work one evening this time last year and smelling what I thought was kerosene. I wondered why someone would be running a kerosene heater in June in Southern California. It turned out, of course, to be the fuel oil spill at Beacon’s. What a sad sight to see.
No easy answer here.
Why utilize alternate forms of energy when you can spend billions on off shore oil rigs; endanger the environment and uglify everyone's ocean view?
Fuel for thought.....
Oil pollutes.
What an idiot!!!
Your US congress plans on working only 6 weeks after the 4th of July. 6 weeks out of 6 months. They will be paid for 6 months work but only work 6 weeks.
No wonder so many want into the US congress.
Gosh we love to bash those on the other side. Careful because the other side is all of us.
Truth is we have had an equal dose of Rep’s and Dem’s the past 100 years guiding our energy policy. The real story is us, and how we consume as individuals and households. We consume at a household rate of twice the average of the rest of the western world (900kwhs per household per month vs. 450kwhs for others) not to mention our cars are among the least efficient and heaviest in the world. We do this because it’s cheap and we’re cheap, not because its right or wrong, and therein lies the problem.
We chose to ignore the oil crisis brought on by the Arab Israeli war in the 70s and actually became more energy dependent during the past three decades as we increased our consumption and imports to provide for our power hunger lifestyles.
Goal number one should be energy independence for both our country and our person.
Goal number two should be reducing the amount of fossil fuel and increasing the amount of renewables until fossil fuel is eliminated. If anything goes offshore it should be windmills or solar platforms not oil rigs.
Lest you think this is a pipe dream, this is exactly what the Danes did in a much harsher climate. They were 95% imported energy dependent in 1973. They are now 100% energy independent with over 30% coming from wind. Their 25 year goal is to increase the renewables to 75% and reduce fossil fual to 25%. Here is a video link that describes their version of an off shore rig.
Bob used the word conservative and that root word is conserve. More of the solution lies in all of conserving rather than increased production . We simply have to make a choice to do so as individuals.
Can you have your cake and eat it too? Perhaps, but conserving is not as hard as you think and does not mean a diminution of lifestyle.
There is something rotten in the U.S. and that something is oil.
Bilbray supports offshore drilling. Most people along the coast, don't.
Dan Dalager wrote two or three letters to the editor supporting Bilbray. I wish we could vote Dalager out this coming November. We're stuck with him for two more years, but we can get Bilbray out.
Comment number one, to which JP responded, sounds like Jerome Stocks and Bilbray supporters wrote it.
The biggest user of oil in the U.S. is the military. Cut back on the war and our "occupation" or "engagement" in Iraq, and we could cut way down on demand for oil.
Also, the price is being driven up by speculators, in the commodities market. I feel our natural resources should be regulated, like our utilities, and the head of the oil corporations should not be making obscene profits, as they are, now.
A report just out this morning forecasts oil demand will INCREASE by 50 % by 2015.
GET THAT THROUGH YOUR HEADS.
The DEMAND INCREASE will come from other nations NOT THE USA. WE CAN NOT CONSERVE ENOUGH TO COUNTER THE INCREASE IN WORLD DEMAND.
FOR YOU ENVIRFREAKS, DEMAND MEANS BURNT OIL. Time to come up with a different approach to global change. Think global, ACT GLOBAL.
The USA has the most efficient economy in the world.
China and India will dwarf the USA very soon in terms of fossil fuel consumption. I forgot, China already exceeds the USA!
Just wait until China's people start to build wealth and want to become consumers. China is the worlds biggest fossil fuel monster.
I am an Old School GOP and I am absolutely against any off shore oil drilling along CA coast line.
I despise Bush, McCain, Bilbray and Stocks. They are not true GOP. They are the only thing worse than a insurance salesman or Realtor, they are pure turncoat politicians.
Thanks JP. Great post.
I am watching the CC meeting on Cox and this lunatic Maggie Houlihan is making a total fool of herself. She is trying to find a reason to disapprove the Walgreens pharmacy so she goes on and on about drive thru traffic and idling cars... What a moron, no one idles their cars anymore, too expensive. I do drive thru banking and while it tkes less than a minute, I kill my motor to save gas. The people using the drive thru at Walgreens will do the same. Also, many elderly use drive thru because it is simpler than finding a parking place and then using a walker or wheel chair.
What an idiot!!! I'm embarrassed to have her as a council person representing this city.
Now Bonds is making a total fool of himself telling stories out his wife sending him to Henry's and he got lost. What idiots we have on the CC. God help this city!!
This is too much for me to take, I'm going to bed, what a bunch of fools.
The ECC is against the Walgreens and they are never against anything so it must really really really suck.
I love Maggie.
I think you better go to bed and hopefully wake up with a more open mind.
The old folks need to get out and walk more to regain some health. Drive thrus are sooooo stinkin
Sitting on your ass all day makes you fat, lazy and more likely to act like a grumpy sick old person.
I am so glad gas prices are going up. It has resulted in several terrific things.
1, No more gridlock on I5.
2. Much less people joyriding in the ultra wasteful bigtire 4 wheel drives.
Good times are coming and Americans are finally starting to change their habits for the better.
Let the Chinese and Indians do as they may. We will continue to adapt and use less oil.
Finally we are starting to realize that bigger does not mean better. Tomorrow is a brighter day for America!
I love you all,

With Barth and Houlihan in opposition Stocks, Bond and Dalager have decided to put the 2% sand tax on the ballot with Steve Aceti tasked to lead the iniative. Writing the ballot argument will be Dalager, Bond, Aceti and Doug Long in his role as Parks and Recreation Commission Chair.
I guess I'm going to help Joe Sheffo craft the statement in opposition.
Joe Sheffo looked good tonight. And Bob Nanninga and Rachelle Collier.
Maggie voted right on not doing another ballot proposition for TOT sand taxes for short term rentals under three units.
She voted unwisely on the Walgreens issue, despite stating good arguments against it in terms of parking, and what has been recommended by other cities and environmental agencies.
Jerome was rude and patronizing, smug, as usual. He was also dictatorial, putting something on the agenda, the TOT ballot issue, trying to claim that staff was "directed by Council," to bring it back, when it was only Sneaky Stocks.
Jerome lets the sunshine law, the administrative policy manual languish, only to be addressed when he's good and ready.
Also, I didn't hear any report out of either closed session. And why were the TWO closed sessions begun at 2:30, SDWD, and 3:00, Council? When did they report back on the SDWD closed session, just before 3:00? No one can attend that early.
We all know, Council is not REQUIRED to have a closed session to discuss anticipated litigation, but it may; this is allowed, by the Brown Act. So, when two different lawsuits are being considered, there is no reason that the public cannot weigh in before using taxpayer money to initiate expensive lawsuits become a "done deal."
conservatives today,are oxyMORONS, they conserve nothing for the future generations but our trash, debt and bankrupt culture. thx you A-hole republicans, like jerome stocks and maggie houlihan(oh yes she voted for the walgreens) and on all issues concerning business she seems to be on the side of big business not the voters of encinitas
DRILL, DRILL, DRILL. Drill everywhere we can. Build refineries. Build nuclear power plants. This all helps.
Change the law and require SDG&E to buy from homeowners excess energy they produce. This would encourage many people to put solar on their roofs.
Build more desal plants. We have more water than we could drink but a few pinheads are stopping us from using the ocean to sustain our communities.
I will be voting yes on the short term sand tax. I hope they make it 5%. We would have more money to maintain our Ciyt from the people exploiting Encinita's character for personal profit.
Bobs statements make it a strike against him and Sheffo. It shows they look at the big picture well.
I find it hilarious that the Republicans are voting for the tax and the Demos are voting against it. It shows how unique our community really is.
Bob, Thanks for volunteering to do the statement against the TOT. As you know, there were volumes written against the tax leading up to the last election. Mike Andreen's comments to NCT regarding the necessity of another 2% are also pertinent.
Do you know the deadline for opposition statement submission?
Of course everyone should pay thier fair share, My argument is not against the 2% Tax. My opposion is about procedure and policy.
Sand Replentishment is an anti-environment boondoggle.

I think it's funny how the right wing am radio screamers have convinced people that drilling in Anwar and off the coast will make us energy independent. Achieving independence would require major conservation and investment in nuclear, coal, wind and solar power.
Nuclear power: what to do with that nasty waste?
Coal: major air pollution.
Wind: works on small regional levels. Kills raptors and other birds.
Solar: Excellent except for one thing, you can't store it so you have to switch to another energy source at night.

Bob, if everyone should pay their fair share is it safe to ask if you support a flat tax??
Just Wondering - I totally support a flat tax. Fair and equal right? What do you think is a "fair" flat tax?
thats simple
Flat tax on sales tax....
On everything the same.
Food, cars, airplanes, boats, cigs, booze.......
the spenders pay more....
reward those that save
everyone pays the same tax when they spend.
Perfect.
Oil rigs -- if they ever are built you can bet they won't be visible from the politicos and developer's ocean front homes.
I am very open to a greatly simplified tax system. My problem with flat sales (or value added) tax is that is regressive by nature. Poor people generally spend almost all their income on consumer goods. Many spend more than their income by increasing debt. More well-off people save and invest. Therefore, the poor are taxed on ~100% of their income while well-off folks are not. I am against punishing the rich, but punishing the poor is certainly not right either. I would like to see tax system that could be explained on a one-page document.
Wouldn't we all!
A flat sales tax is the most fair for poor people.
Rich people don't have a income they report. Only poor working people do.
Rich people currently pay anywhere between 1% to 5% per year of their true income per year. While some middle class renters pay 28%.
Poor people can survive on a lot less. The "poor" in America live like movie stars compared to the common folk in 90% of the world.
More people need to travel to understand how things truly are around the world.
the saddest thing that I see time and time again is Americas misreading on happiness……money and material things have nothing to do with happiness. Freedom and self respect make people happy. I see folks that don't have shoes and work 12 hours per day smiling 90% of the day.
In America, I also see fat people sitting on their butt, expecting others to care for them and tree them like snoop dog.
Welfare kills. Stop the hand outs including rent control, food stamps, and rent subsidies and give people back their dignity and the ability to be happy.
This is why the entire democratic platform is broken. The "Donkeys" expect the government to take care of everything. The Donkeys need to read Animal Farm.
PS-
the republicans are worse. The just spend all of Americas future on bombing and occupying other nations.
A flat tax is too simple, too realistic and harmful to existing businesses. As this country has become a corporation for the corporation and by the corporation, a tax on use will gouge into the luxury item market -- which after all is most of what Americans buy -- TVs, booze, cigs, Ipods, cell phones, etc. And, these commodities cost the most to produce -- fiscal sense does not the Congress wield.
It is undisputed that bush was "elected" by all the blue religiously repressed and ideologically constipated states --and they just happen to be the states that receive the most federal funds -- now who is promoting a welfare state?
Bush is the Devil.
No human could be so bad on every level.
Flat tax. What?
Think of all that senseless paper work that wouldn't need to be filled out.
Think about all those hours spent each year by every citizen making a meager living.
Think about all those CPA and sucklets and Lawyers who make their living on income tax laws.
Think of all those workfare federal employees at the IRS that would no longer have a job.
I agree. Flat tax make to much sense. It could never happen in America. The land of the fat backward ass lazy fool.Cucina Urbana has a new pastry chef.

CINCINNATI – The U.S. Supreme Court denied Monday a second appeal in the conviction of Ryan Widmer for the murder of his wife.
The Warren County man was found guilty of drowning his wife, Sarah, after three trials.
The Supreme Court discussed Widmer’s second and possibly final appeal over DNA evidence since Friday.
The appeal was over DNA tests of Widmer’s wife that were denied by a judge. Widmer was convicted of drowning Sarah in the couple’s bathtub in 2008.
Widmer's attorney, Michele Berry-Godsey, clarified the court's Monday decision.
"This was not an appeal raising all the errors that occurred before and during Ryan's trial," Berry-Godsey said. "This was an attempt to have the Court clarify the right to DNA testing in a situation like Ryan's, where testing could prove that no crime even occurred. So we're not at all discouraged by the Court not accepting Ryan's case because the Supreme Court reviews thousands of petitions and only accepts a very small number that the Court believes need clarified for the entire country."
A jury found Widmer guilty of killing his wife in his first trial but that decision was overturned due to juror misconduct. A second trial ended in a hung jury.
Berry-Godsey said the next step in Widmer's defense would be to file a habeas petition in U.S. District Court that will raise what the defense believes to be constitutional violations that occurred before and during Widmer's trial.
"So the next step will be filing the federal habeas petition which likely will occur in February. We're far from exhausting all of our options, and we won't give up on any of those until Ryan is free," she added.
Widmer is currently serving 15 years to life in a state prison.
He previously lost four appeals in the Ohio Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court denied a previous appeal earlier this month.
In Widmer's first Supreme Court appeal, it took one week for the justices to hand down a decision after discussing it in conference.NYIT to Host TEDxNYIT: "Meta Resiliency - the Resiliency of Resiliency" on October 10
13 Speakers, 3 Performance Artists, TED Videos and Ideas Worth Spreading from Global Visionaries, Doers, and Thinkers
Source Newsroom: New York Institute of Technology
Newswise — New York, N.Y (October 2, 2013) – New York Institute of Technology has organized TEDxNYIT, a day-long event on October 10 that will focus on resiliency, its relevance, and its meaning for people, cities, cultures, and our global community.
TEDxNYIT - Meta Resiliency - includes thirteen speakers, three performing artists, and previously videotaped TED talks meant to spark “ideas worth spreading” on the leadership needed to reinvent communities. The event will be held at NYIT Auditorium on Broadway from 9 am to 5:30 pm, and will be followed with a reception.
Frank Mruk, associate dean of NYIT School of Architecture and Design and the event’s organizer, said TEDxNYIT grew out of a student-led movement to consider major community regeneration following Hurricane Sandy’s destruction of coastal areas in the New York metropolitan area. Operation Resilient Long Island, the NYIT student group, launched a global competition to collect ideas that would help areas become more resilient as they rebuilt.
“Each step was a higher level iteration than the one previous, engaging more and more people,” said Mruk. “Now it’s way beyond an architectural or urban planning question of resilience.”
Mruk contacted TED, a nonprofit devoted to spreading worthwhile ideas. TED conferences focus on Technology, Entertainment and Design, and speakers “give the talk of their lives” in 18 minutes or less. Talks are then spread and shared globally on the group’s concept of resiliency itself – is it sustainable or is it a fad – these are relevant questions just one year after Hurricane Sandy,” Mruk said. “We’ve had major disruptions – 9/11, the financial crisis, climate change, revolution – it’s time to think about resiliency from a higher level.”
Among the speakers are Claes Frossen of Sweden, who participated in the movement of a city affected by mining operations, Margaret Newman from the NYC Dept. of Transportation, Canada’s Ron Dembo, Ph.D., a risk management and climate change expert, and Fernando Romero of FR-EE, an architecture practice based in Mexico City and New York.
NYIT alumni Alex Alaimo will focus his talk on Operation Resilient Long Island and the winners of the 3C Comprehensive Coastal Communities competition, which garnered more than 300 registrations from 20 countries.
Performers at TEDxNYIT include Carter Brey, principal cellist of the NY Philharmonic, Harpist Erin Hill, and indie band City of the Sun.
Tickets are available at
“NYIT is a global university and, in the words of our president Dr. Edward Guiliano, an ‘idea incubator,’” said Mruk, “so the TEDxNYIT format is a great platform that allows us to dive deeper into ideas , while gaining a broad perspective on the thoughts of some of the world’s great visionaries and doers.”
About TEDx
In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TED has created a program called TEDx. TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. NYIT’s event is called TEDxNYIT, where x=independently organized TED event. At TEDxNY.SWOSU Participating in Weight Loss Challenge

Ever since the word "metrosexual" started floating around, we've had to get used to men looking, well, a little girlier. It became perfectly acceptable for men's grooming habits to include getting a manicure, their eyebrows waxed or even a facial. But now there's a new trend for men taking care of themselves: "man waxing".
The trend comes to us from the similar man-scaping, a term similar to "landscaping" where men trim and otherwise take care of their body hair. Man waxing is basically men taking care of their hair… down there. You know how we have to get bikini waxes and Brazilian waxes these days? Well, now men get to do it, too.
Read more ¿Qué más? Social media says women want ice cream, men want cars and both want pizza!
Okay, I'm not going to lie here. I know what a lot of your reactions are going to be: EW! GROSS! WHY AREN'T MEN ACTUALLY MEN ANYMORE?
I hear you, I really do. But I really think that's an overreaction. Man-scaping and man waxing is not inherently a bad thing. In fact, we shouldn't be using the word "man" in front of these at all. They're just men… who are waxing because they want to look a little better. What's wrong with that?
Personally, I think nothing. I don't need my man to be hairy everywhere to prove to me that he's a man. Maybe it's because I've never liked macho guys and my dad's dormant but-sometimes-comes-out-unexpectedly machismo has always annoyed me, but I don't think we should judge these men because they want to get a little below-the-belt improvement. We're practically forced to wax it all off, so why can't they?
Want to find other moms como tú? "Like" MamásLatinas on Facebook!
If it gives them a little bit of confidence or is pleasing to the eye (okay, I admit it: I like my men minimally hairy), what's wrong with it? Is having less hair down there really going to make him a worse father or a worse husband? Waxing his nether regions isn't going to make him less capable of playing with the kids, earning money or taking out the trash, right? So what's the big deal, anyway? It's certainly not going to have a negative effect on your sex life, so long as you let his added confidence transfer into the bedroom and don't judge him (or look down on him) for wanting a nicer package. Besides, if you're suffering the pain of getting hair ripped out of YOUR body, then he should too.
Do you think it's a good idea for your husband to "man wax"? Would you think he's less of a man if he wanted to look a little less hairy?

jaja,ami en lo personal megustan sin bellos en ningun lado y como comentan no tiene nada de malo en que los hombres se depilen es algo normal en estos dias o no?OCEAN SPRINGS, Miss. (AP) — After eight weeks of TV crews following every move as they ran their barbecue restaurant in Ocean Springs, the Orrison family spent a weekend in Orange Beach, Ala., relaxing before Monday's premier.
Marketing director Linda Orrison tells The Mississippi Press that the crews filmed six episodes of "The Shed," a Food Network show about the restaurant with that name and its owners. The ramshackle restaurant is a popular spot with people from the region. The restaurant burned in 2012, but has since rebuilt.
Orrison says the family should know fairly quickly if they will get a second season, since that depends on ratings for the first few episodes.
Orrison's son and daughter, Brad and Brooke Orrison, opened the restaurant in 2002. Brad was 24 and Brooke 19.
Linda Orrison says The Food Network and another national network competed for the rights to the show.Posted by Roy
I have hired Gust Sarris on numerous occasions to handle the many different needs of my business and he has never left me down. What has always impressed me was his entrepreneurial skills and inquisitive nature coupled with his vast knowledge of BUSINESS in general to keep my firm out of hot water. He has helped me with everything from business plans, reviews of my marketing materials and other critical contracts that surround all of us business owners. There are many fine attorneys that I have dealt with around Jacksonville, but I have never found one that has the business savvy and experience that Gust brings to the table.
Posted by Randy
Gust Sarris is a very knowledgable attorney with outstanding ethical practices. Gust is helpful and caring of his clients situations and holds all matters in the strictest confidence. I consider Gust my family's attorney and would highly reccomend him to any of my friends, family and associates. Gust is direct and kind and explains things in an understandable manner.
Posted by a Estate Planning client
My business relationship with Mr. Saris started in July 2009 and included a new client fee of $750 which I paid in August 2009 plus $200 per month paid from August 2009 through April 2010. The recurring fee covered the cost of a one hour meeting each month and entitled me to a discount on the cost of any litigation.
We met five times in the first seven months on 7/24/09, 8/6/09, 8/20/09, 11/3/09 and 1/29/09. At these meetings we discussed various legal questions faced by my businesses. I was generally satisfied with the outcome of these meetings; however, he was very poor and responding to email inquiries. I often had to ask the same question in two meetings before it was addressed.
During our meeting on 2/15/10 we talked about estate planning. In advance of the meeting I completed his estate planning questionnaire. We talked for about 2 hours. At the time I paid a fee of $2,750 for estate planning services. I expected that Mr. Saris would prepare an estate plan based on the information he gathered through the questionnaire and interview.
We did not meet at all in March or April. Regardless, I paid the $200 monthly fee these months. I thought Mr. Saris was busy creating a complex estate plan.
We met again on 5/28/10 to review the estate plan. We talked for about an hour but mostly we covered the same subjects as the first meeting. Mr. Saris had not prepared any documents nor made any plans based on the results of our first meeting. He came to the meeting with a blank piece of paper. Two and a half months after I paid for estate planning services nothing had been accomplished.
When I looked back over these events I felt that I did not get any extra service for the $2,750 fee. We had only 7 meetings during the 11 months we were working together. No documents were drawn up for the estate plan. Even though we spent some time talking about estate plans we did not utilize any more of your time than the regular maintenance fee would allow.
On 6/16/10 I asked Mr. Saris to refund the $2,750 estate planning fee. On 7/4/10 I asked about the status of the refund request and Mr. Saris said he would work on evaluating the situation ‘this week’. On 8/5/10 I asked again about the status of my refund request. This time, Mr. Saris indicated that he needed to take the issue up at a partner meeting which will be held ‘next week’. On 9/17/10 Mr. Saris offered a 50% refund of the estate planning fee. I accepted his offer but it took several more emails and four more weeks for me to receive a $1,300 check.
In summary, I paid $2,750 in February for ‘estate planning services’. After 4 months Mr. Saris had delivered no documents of any kind. I asked for a refund. It took 4 more months to get less than half of my money back. I think that Mr. Saris should have quickly refunded the entire estate planning fee even though it was called a ‘non-refundable fee’.

Gust was imperative to the establishment of our Corporation.
I was in need of legal consultation/representation to establish a unique business and was worried the initial corporate structuring would be difficult. Gust's thorough knowledge of corporate structure and business principles made the process simpler. Our corporation is now on its way to success thanks to Gust and his qualified staff!
Posted by David
An organization I belong to recently had a big dilemma. The person representing several of our members in a property valuation protest suddenly passed away. Mr. Sarris, on short notice, stepped up and took on our cause right in the middle of the process. He went on and did a fine job of representing us and without asking for any other funds than what had been allocated for the first person.
Posted by Nathan
I definately recommend Gust Sarris to anyone seeking legal advice. I have found him to be sincere,responsive and successful in accomplishing the various opportunities and challenges I have experienced over the 20 years I have known him. Even though it may be months between meetings or discussions I know that he'll take my call and move quickly to capitalize on or resolve the need at hand.
Posted by a Business client
I contacted Mr. Gust Sarris and his firm regarding setting up my start up business. I am so happy that I did. Within a 15 minute conversation he opened up my eyes to certain aspects of my business that would have left me vulnerable to being sued. I talked to other law firms previously but was not satisfied with the way I was being treated nor did they ever bring up any of these vulnerabilities. You know, small fish, big pond, ect. From now on I know where I need to go for legal advice.
Posted by a client
I went to see Gust Sarris to discuss a new business entity with six other women in six different states. Of course, we were talking about setting up the company right away. Gust brought so many issues to my attention that I hadn't thought of which are extremely important - especially if the busines becomes as successful as we hope it will. I am so glad that I talked to him before proceeding with a legal entity. We are putting the creation of the business on hold until we have all of our ducks in a row. When the time comes, I will go back to Gust for all of the legal needs of the business. He is an very astute businessman as well as a lawyer.Marvel at the sights, revel in the sounds, and soak up the local atmosphere: When you book a room at the best San Francisco hotels near Coyote Point Museum, you’ll be in the top spot to do it all.

He was the top American finisher for the third straight year and the sixth time in his career, and he’s happy about that, but he’s also philosophical about it, and yeah, he’d rather have won the thing.
“I had the best day I could have had. Some people just had a better day,” Middaugh said.
Middaugh was fourth two years ago and second last year.
For this year’s 18th annual event, Middaugh was among 800 endurance athletes from 35 countries and 43 U.S. states who made the trek to Maui. Along with the brutal course, they endured Saturday’s 90 degree heat, which turned it into something of a race of attrition.
Ruben Ruzafa, of Spain, was this year’s men’s winner, returning to the XTERRA World Championships after a five-year-hiatus. Middaugh beat Ruzafa in last month’s U.S. nationals in Utah. This time it was not to be.
Middaugh and Ruzafa were close when they came out of the water, following a one-mile ocean swim. But Middaugh said his swim was about a minute slower than he wanted it to be.
Still, that left Middaugh within striking distance. Usually he would have been able to push to the lead in the 20-mile mountain bike ride and the 10-kilometer (6.2-mile) trail run, but Rufaza’s bike ride was other worldly.
Ruzafa trailed the leaders by two minutes after the swim, but he more than made up for it with his astonishing bike ride. He finished with a bike split of 1:30:11, the fastest of the day by more than a minute. He eventually reeled in all the leaders on the bike and had a lead of about 45 seconds entering the run.
“I’m happy with the effort I put into it, but I was a little too far behind out of the water,” Middaugh said.
Middaugh trailed by about a minute, 30 seconds from the lead after the bike, and that’s usually a pretty good position, he said.
“It’s really hard to make up that much time on the run when you’re not feeling fresh, and I put a lot into the bike trying to catch guys,” he said.
Nobody got close to Ruzafa on the run, and he eventually finished 1 minute, 27 seconds, ahead of the rest of the field.
“I’m happy with the season. It’s a good performance, just not the one I was looking for,” Middaugh said.
He said he’ll stick around Hawaii a few days and take a few weeks off to let his body reset. He said you can expect to see him around the valley this winter in some local events, representing Dogma Athletica and Beaver Creek.
Reigning world champion Javier Gomez was missing from this year’s XTERRA start list. Middaugh came into Saturday’s event as the reigning U.S. champion, and in the 2012 worlds he beat everybody except Gomez by more than two minutes.
Ruzafa won the XTERRA Worlds in 2008, got injured a few days before the 2009 race, then spent the next few years focusing on mountain bike races. He successfully switched from mountain biking to XTERRA this year and won two races in Europe and finished on the podium at the U.S. Championships last month in Utah.

Be careful if you talk to Dr. Elterman! He will omit things that contradict his report. I'm going to request his notes, as suggested in another review. Also, his cell phone use during interviews and home visits is unbelievably rude.

I had an excellent experience with Dr. Elterman. I was very intimidated I had to have a Section 15 report done at all (an attempt by my ex-husband to stop a move to a different province), let alone that I had to expose my daughters to it. As it turned out Dr. Elterman was a gem with the children and they had fun with him. He also saw right through my ex'es web of delusions & lies and not only was I able to move, he said it would be detrimental for them not to be in my care.

I'm afraid my experience with Dr. Elterman was also not a positive one. He was clearly swayed by the lies of my psychopathic ex-wife and took her side. He tried to put words in the mouths of my witnesses and in his report twisted what they said. My ex continued to poison my daughter's mind against me between the ages of 6 and 10 and she has since become estranged from me. Her life is now a mess. She's attempted suicide at least once and run away from home. On the personal side, I too found Dr. Elterman disheveled and unprofessional in appearance. His handshake was weak and his hands told of a man who has never done an honest days work in his life. Yet people have to pay a king's ransom for his "services."

I saw Dr. Elterman as an adult woman years ago. He was very calm and I could discuss nitty gritty unpleasant things with him, with complete ease. He was very understanding, kind, and helpful to me in helping me with past history of a sadistic, abusive father. Now many years later with my father's death, and upon discovering written documents from my father, as well as family verification, EVERYTHING Dr. Elterman said was true. I retain a warm grateful spot in my scarred heart for the words Dr. Elterman said to me so many years ago. I felt he welcomed me to sessions as if I were worth a million dollars. I am grateful to Dr. Michael Elterman.

The field project was based at McMurdo Station and at the Italian Terra Nova station, Mario Zuchelli. Seismic stations were located at remote sites across the northern Transantarctic Mountains and onto the East Antarctic plateau. Once in Antarctica, the field locations were reached either via helicopter or fixed wing Twin Otter Aircraft. The field team shared dormitory housing. Fieldwork was conducted outside at cold and (in some cases) fairly high altitude conditions.

Thursday, July 19, 2012
QUEBEC CITY, Que. - "We will learn and surprise" was the motto of the Québec City Amiral at the beginning of the 2012 W-League season, and they have certainly done both.
Two months and 12 games later, the team from Québec owns some impressive statistics: 8 wins, 2 draws and only 2 defeats. This adds up to a second-place finish in the Central Conference, allowing the Amiral to host the conference finals for the first time this weekend. The top team in the conference, the Ottawa Fury, will host the 2012 W-League Championship and have advanced directly to the final weekend.
A memorable season and final sprint
Rejuvenated and returnig 70 percent of the roster from 2011, the 2012 edition of the Amiral learned fast.
"We knew that the girls were young but talented. It took them a short time to get to know the league's level, but they believed in themselves and their results are there to prove that," Amiral Head Coach Samir Ghrib said.
Québec City has been undefeated since June 22, and its players succeded in playing five games in 10 days, winning four with one draw. The Amiral even defeated the Fury on their home field on July 15, giving them their first home loss in 31 games.
The playoffs: a new season
In 2011, the Amiral played in the conference final for the first time in their history, losing to Ottawa in a disappointing 6-0 game. The young team will try to do better in 2012, hopefully reaching the W-League's final four.
"It's the beginning of a new season and we will stay faithful to our philosophy: One game at a time," Ghrib said. "Our success in the regular season allows us to believe in our means, but we know it won't be easy. We will have to work, work and work again, but that's our trademark."
The Amiral will face Hamilton FC at 1 p.m. ET on Saturday at the Collège François-Xavier Garneau. Laval and Toronto will meet in the other semifinal game at 4 p.m. ET. The final is set to take place at 1 p.m. ET on Sunday on the Amiral's home turf..”
The club is hosting a fundraiser from 7:30 p.m. to 10:30 p.m. Friday. “The Rocking for the Right to Learn Arts Festival & Competition” will include a battle of the bands competition, a poetry slam competition, an art auction, and a magic show. Tickets are $10.
Zubair and Zhang said they have collected $1,000 so far from local sponsors and want to raise $20,000, and have collected $1,000 so far from local sponsors. for their project.
The pair decided to do something after working with Dr. Weeks pupils foras part of their Rhetoric of Race course. As they worked on projects with the children, they realized they didn’t have enough basic school supplies — like crayons, markers, scissors, colored pencils, and glue sticks — to go around.
“They had to share, and with other items they would just run out,” Zubair said. “We were really bothered by this. It’s shocking when you go to a school 10 minutes away that has everything you need.”
Even boxes of facial tissue are scarce, Zubair said.
The club asked the school to make up compile a wish-list, and began its “Kits with Kids” campaign. The idea is for Dr. Weeks’ children to work with F-M to assemble the kits.
“This isn’t just high school students giving them school supplies and then leaving,” Zhang said. “It’s having a sustained relationships. We both give each other something, and it’s not all material.”
Wayne Gillespie, a second-grade teacher at Dr. Weeks, said his class of 22 looks forward to visits from their high school “buddies.” They read together, perform skits and learn about each other.
“They’re developing a partnership,” he said. “Our school offers a culturally diverse and language diverse environment for them to get involved with.”
Gillespie said the school is grateful for F-M’s help. The classes run out of supplies as the year progresses, and teachers often wind up buying items themselves.for their classes. Tissues aren’t even in the supply requisition catalog, he said.
“This is a great example of community action, and of high school kids getting involved and learning about the broader community,” he said.USB 3.0 not working a75m-hvs

But through decades of living in world hot spots, Ford has maintained a passion for Baltimore since he first arrived from Denver in 1976 to enroll at the Johns Hopkins University. He rattles off Baltimore haunts such as the Owl Bar and City Cafe with equal ease as names of foreign ministers in Iraq, Syria and Egypt.
"I don't know, the place draws you in," said Ford, who bought a home in Bolton Hill last year, the latest he's owned in the city over the years. "In Washington, people ask you what you do. I hate that. Here they don't do that. Here they say, 'Where did you go to school?' I like that much better."
He acknowledges being viewed as something of an oddity by his peers for living outside the diplomatic center of the country. He's fine with that.
Ford, considered among the State Department's foremost Arabic speakers, returned to the United States last year after a brief but remarkable stint in Damascus, the Syrian capital, where he angered President Bashar Assad's government by continuing to meet with opposition leaders despite warnings not to do so.
A former top political adviser to the U.S. ambassador in Iraq, Ford was appointed to the U.S. Embassy in Syria by President Barack Obama in 2010 after a five-year period in which the United States did not post an ambassador there. Senate Republicans blocked his confirmation, objecting to the message they felt the appointment would send to the Assad regime.
Obama bypassed the Senate and used a recess appointment to put Ford in the job through the end of 2011.
As tensions increased in Syria last summer following civil uprisings throughout the Arab world, Ford made a surprise trip to the city of Hama to meet with demonstrators. He was greeted with cheers — people threw roses and palm leaves on his car — but the government was livid. He was accused of smuggling weapons to the protesters.
Days later, pro-government forces stormed the U.S. Embassy, damaging the building. Ford continued to visit restive cities to meet with opposition leaders. In September, government loyalists formed a mob outside an office in Damascus where he was meeting a prominent dissident, trapping him inside for two hours. The crowd then threw concrete blocks and iron bars at his motorcade.
.
"I knew they'd be angry," he said of Assad's regime. "They were angrier than I thought they would be."
As news of Ford's actions spread in Washington, Senate Republicans reversed course. Ford's confirmation was approved unanimously in October.
."
The situation in Syria continued to deteriorate. In October, the Obama administration temporarily recalled the newly confirmed Ford, citing "credible threats against his personal safety." He returned to Syria in December but then left again in February when the United States closed its embassy in there, pulling its remaining diplomatic staff home.
Last week, in response to a massacre that left more than 100 dead — including women and children killed in their homes — the United States cut one more of its final formal ties with the country, expelling the Syrian charge d'affaires..
TheritzeCopyright © 2015, Orlando Sentinel and supersedes the formation of negative divisions. Instead, they obsessively focused on the superficial differences between them. The b’nai Leah thought they were superior and looked down upon the sons of the sh’fachos, instead of recognizing and appreciating the unique role that their half-brothers were to play. Yosef, a bit arrogant and caught up in his own beauty, would work with the bnai Leah during the day and spend time with the sons of the sh’fachos at night. Not quite a member of the first club, he basked in the superiority and adulation he felt in the presence of the second. He was not only “brotherless”, in the sense that he could not form a real connection with any of his brothers (Binyamin being too young at the time), but also “motherless”, growing up mostly without the love and attention of a mother figure unlike all of his older brothers. He develop in himself an extreme feeling of individuality and isolation, which was the cause of his attempts to win more of his father’s love by tattling on his brothers. The b’nai shfachos, on the other hand, perhaps feeling slighted and marginalized, turned inward and eventually joined the campaign against Yosef — better to be on the more powerful side than on the side of the privileged but troubled loner.
These descriptions in the Torah sound eerily like petty feuds, rivalries, and attempts at social exclusion that the world has seen untold times, and yet they are even still the primary cause of all our sufferings in exile. Just serve Me, Hashem says, and you will get along. You will develop an understanding of your own special duty to me, and cease to worry about the superficial differences over time. But they, as we, would not listen. Although we are the same, brilliantly diverse chunks of the infinite rained down into this world into more or less similar bodies and life challenges, yet instead of focusing on the differences that are real — the different levels and duties of our souls — we focus on the ones that hurt, fascinate, and occupy us on the superficial level, the exoticness of the slightly different-looking and differently quirked behavior, and so forth. How easily this obsession turns to hate and isolation, because these differences not only form no basis for a higher unity, but need to be maintained and reinforced through an ongoing effort.
The differences in our neshamos are just there, require no special maintenance, and our the basis for a beautiful coming together that the physical world can only serve as an expression of. But Yosef and his brothers occupied themselves in maintaining the differences between them, an activity which requires constant upping of the levels of jealousy and hatred just to keep those differences noticeable. Since these superficial differences are not really there, it is only through manipulation of emotions that they can be made noticeable — and this level of manipulation must be intensified over time or we would just grow numb to these supposed differences (c”v!). This effort to constantly point out surface differences and generate negative feelings about them only leads to disastrous events, from the selling of Yosef to the churban and on down the line.
It is only when the disastrous consequences of sinah and kinah are clear, do we attempt to return to each other, but this work of repairing exaggerated differences is far more difficult than the work of creating them in the first place. So the longer we are in galus, the opportunity to simply ignore our differences and serve Hashem alone, the opportunity for each of us to focus on our unique avodah in the Divine division of labor becomes more and more precious. The superficial differences among us have become so magnified over the generations that we almost can’t see past them to what really distinguishes us from one another — our neshamos and the avodah they impose on us. Only this recognition, 1) that the differences we see in the physical world are nothing in comparison to the differences in our neshamos, and 2) these superficial differences and the work that goes into maintaining them only serve to divide rather than unite, will lead us to…
3! An understanding that our neshamos were sent down here to be TRULY different from each other, uniting their special avodos to bring us to the ge’ulah, may it be soon. This will be the ultimate vayeshev Yakov, not in the sense of being settled but in the sense of shuv or teshuvah, all the sons of Yakov returning to Hashem and each other one triumphant last time.» See more back issues of the magazine

Like in most cities women in Medellin party and flirt with American men very hard, Barrio Colombia, Parque lleras and Las Palmas ae happening places. I was in Barrio Colombia last week with friends enjoying the nigh out there are thousands of sexy women with big boobs. Luxury is the best place to hang out, the drink are modestly expensive 1/2 a bottle on Vodka is about $50 the bottle itself is 70000 peso and 17000 peso for orange juice plus tips, at least 4 people can enjoy the drink for few hours. The clubs is filled with below 21 girls. The women are drop dead gorgeous, most of them come in groups, but you can ask girls out to dance. Knowing how to dance is key to scoring with women, you need strong legs and nice moves. Women in Medellin can dance all night and can also drink all night, at the club they seem more comfortable drinking and feel at ease. The two more important things in a women's life dancing and music are available in the club. Walk around find some good looking single women and ask them to dance, you can later ask for phone number and invite them to your place for a late night party. We scored with many women using the dance moves. Medellin women love to meet white blond men from US and Europe, they love to get to know you and invite you to dance.
Many men dream of having such a beautiful woman for a girlfriend or a wife. It's a common fantasy, especially in North America and Europe, where their beauty has the added perk of exoticness.
Unfortunately, these men usually think that it's a fantasy that can never be achieved. And maybe it was in the past, but not anymore.
Why Men Think It's Impossible
There is this misconception that dating a Colombian women are out of reach for most men. There are two reasons why men think like this and thus give up before they even try.
The first one is that this is the stereotype that appears in movies, TV shows and commercials. All women in romantic settings are absolutely gorgeous. Not only that, the guy that finally gets the girl is also very handsome. Even if he's poor, he's not the kind of poor that you and I would consider poor. They usually live in a nice, if not luxurious house, in suburbia or in a good apartment in Manhattan. How many poor men you know that can afford that kind of housing? Lastly, they always work as freelancers, and never in a cubicle.
Therefore, if you don't have that kind of resources or looks, you end up believing that these women are not for you.
The second reason is that the “normal” way to meet someone new is at bars or at night clubs. That might work for some, but not for most. It's a setting where the only thing you get to know about is what type of clothes you are wearing at the moment. Obviously, this approach doesn't work for most people.
But It Can Happen
The truth is that these Latina women are as lonely as you are. For the most part, they don't want to be judged based on what they're wearing. While very young girls will certainly be attracted by looks only, women understand that there are other things that are valuable. And they certainly aren't going to find them in a night club.
That's why you have a much better chance than what you think.
Think about this for a minute. Let's not take looks into consideration for a moment. What attributes would you like in a person that you want to spend the rest of your life with? Most people think of something like this:
-Good sense of humor.
-Tolerance.
-Responsibility.
-Good work ethics.
-Family values.
Now, tell me. When you're in a nightclub or bar, with bad light and loud music, would you be able to tell if the person has these attributes (or whatever attributes you value?) Of course not! You'll be lucky if you get someone to go out with you on a date and then you'll spend your time and money in the hopes that she meets the profile. In turn, it might happen that you'll not fit her profile! A few weeks and a couple hundred dollars (if not more) down the toilet and back to zero.
Meet Latinas Online!
You might also have the problem that there just aren't many Latinas where you live. But now you can meet them, get to know them and find someone who wants the same things you do.
In romancelatina.com, you don't have to look like Brad Pitt or have a Porsche to find a beautiful woman that you can have chemistry with. You don't have to spend your time and money going to places where your good points won't show. You can meet and talk with someone right in your home or your office. In fact, you can meet and talk with many girls at the same time, increasing your chances of finding someone you like, but also someone you'd like to be with.
What Latinas Value
Latinas, like many women, like men who work on their appearance. While you don't have to have a great body, you do have to comb your hair and wear clean clothes when talking with a beautiful colombian woman. Take a look at your place as well. You don't have to live in a mansion, but make sure that your house is clean and arranged. It's a detail that many men forget when they talk to a woman on webcam. That will make you look like you care for yourself, and therefore, you can care for others.
In addition, Latinas are specially attracted by two types of men: hard working men and family men. They like responsible, punctual, formal men who enjoy having a family.
Of course, there are always exceptions, and if all you want is someone to have fun with, then you'll find it at romancelatina as well.
What are You Waiting For?
Today could be the day that you finally took a step towards ditching loneliness and finding someone you'd like to be with. And someone with the natural beauty of a Latina, to boot! It costs you nothing to sign up and start talking with real, Beautiful Latin women who are also looking for a partner.
By signing up with romancelatina.com, you'll have access to hundreds of women profiles. If you're shy, you can start by spending your time browsing the profiles until you find someone you'll feel comfortable talking to.
Don't worry about the language barrier. Most Latin women know at least some basic English and you'll find that when you really want to speak with a beautiful girl, learning a few basic Spanish phrases will be easy as pie.

Tom’s father Matthew is taking a star-studded team to play the local side with profits going to the Tom Maynard Trust of which Flintoff is one of the four trustees.
Ashes hero Flintoff has been attempting a Twenty20 comeback with Lancashire but has yet to break into the first team. If he is not required for the NatWest T20 Blast match against Yorkshire tomorrow evening, Flintoff will be in south Wales on Friday.
Maynard has already assembled Flintoff’s Ashes 2005 team-mate Simon Jones, South African batsman Jacques Rudolph, Glamorgan captains Mark Wallace and Jim Allenby, ex-Australian all-rounder Ian Harvey, Welsh boxing legend Joe Calzaghe and former Wales rugby internationals Nicky Robinson and Rhys Williams.
The match is in memory of Tom Maynard who died in June 2012 in an accident at a London train station, with Wednesday marking the anniversary.
“It has been a long time in the preparation and hats off to everyone at St Fagans who have worked tirelessly to organise it,” said Matthew Maynard.
“It takes time but St Fagans is a club close to my and Tom’s heart and we are grateful to the support they have shown.
“I have just got the side together and I am delighted with the make-up.
“I’m really looking forward to the day and we have some fantastic names lined up to play.
“Last year’s event was wonderful, but the rain frustrated us, so we’re really hoping for some sunshine.”
The Twenty20 match starts at 3pm. The match is open to the general public, with admission costing £5 for adults and free for children. For more details, visit

Undefeated pound-for-pound king Mayweather makes a triumphant return to the ring
By Mike Sempervive, Sunday, May 5, 2013
After a year-long layoff, which included much personal and professional change, Floyd "Money" Mayweather returned to the ring on Saturday night, and dominated Robert “The Ghost” Guerrero, winning a 12-round unanimous decision, in Las Vegas, to remain undefeated.
In front of a crowd of 15,880 (with 8,292 additional watching on adjacent closed-circuit), paying $9,922,350, at the MGM Grand Garden Arena, Mayweather weathered initial pressure by Guerrero, and increased his hand speed and movement as the fight went on, easily racking up points by stifling both the southpaw’s offensive charges, and counters off of defense, and landing pummeling straight right hands.
All three judges scored the fight 117-111.
With the victory, Mayweather runs his record to 44 (26)-0 (0), 22-0 in title fights, and retains his World Boxing Council (WBC) welterweight (147-pound) championship, as well as winning the recognition as The Ring magazine World welterweight champion (which had been previously vacant).
Guerrero, 30, came into the bout with the recognition of being the “interim” WBC champion, due to Mayweather’s inactivity following his bout last May against Miguel Cotto, and won the right to face Mayweather with an exciting unanimous decision victory over Andre Berto. With Saturday night’s loss, his first since 2005, the Gilroy, California fighter falls to 31 (18)-1 (0)-1 draw, and 2 no contests.
Mayweather began the bout devoid of movement, choosing to stand in and respond to Guerrero’s charges by counter punching and fighting inside. That initially gave Guerrero confidence, and he had won round two on most observers scorecards by throwing combinations, and landing to the body during clinches.
That success was fleeting, though, as Mayweather really began to feel Guerrero out, finding his range, and increasing his movement, as the bout transpired. Using careful head movement, and a good left jab to set up hard straight hands to Guerrero’s face, while pushing himself into his challengers left side to stifle his counter left hands. When Guerrero was actually able to land a direct hard shot, it was only one at a time, and usually followed soon after by a head-snapping Mayweather right.
“My father told me before the fight, ‘I tell you what’s gonna get him. The right hand.’ All I did was go out there and deliver the game plan that was given to me,” said “Money” afterwards.
In round eight, Mayweather busted Guerrero’s left eye open with a punch, that Guerrero’s corner tried to argue was from an elbow. “Money” continued to evade any efforts offered, seemingly increasing his speed any time Guerrero tried vainly to do the same.
After the bout, Mayweather said at some point he hurt his right hand, but got through it without an issue. His father claimed earlier at the presser that his son would be fighting again in September, which Mayweather didn’t deny, only saying he would be “taking some time off.”
This was Mayweather’s first fight since last Cinco de Mayo’s unanimous decision victory over Miguel Cotto. Over the summer, the Michigan native-turned Las Vegas resident served two months of a 90 days prison term, following taking a plea bargain in an assault case against his ex-girlfriend, and mother of two of his kids, Josie Harris.
Aside from this being his first fight out of prison, and the obligatory whispers of if and when the 36-year old superstar will show signs of serious age, there were a few other question marks for the Mayweather camp coming into the night, including the decision to bring back his estranged trainer, and father, Floyd Senior, to help lead him into the fight, and not his uncle Roger, who has trained him for the last thirteen years.
Additionally, Roger was also not selected by the younger Floyd to appear as a corner man for the bout, who instead chose the CEO of Mayweather Promotions/his manager Leonard Ellerbe to be the chief second to his father, and cutman Rafael Garcia. Mayweather claimed Roger’s health issues with sugar diabetes may cause him to have vision issues during the bout, which was a decision that caused uneasy feelings for some - including his father, who railed against it, but knew that it was an issue that was out of his control.
During the post-introduction instructions by referee Robert Byrd prior to the bout, Floyd Senior and Ruben Guerrero, also his son’s father/trainer, jawed back and forth at each others, as their sons stared each other down. At the post-fight presser, Senior was asked how his relationship is with Floyd, and he says “sometimes you have to grind it out... some relationships.” But their common bond is the sport. “That’s always been our main thing anyway... I love boxing. He loves boxing.”
In February, Mayweather went through a big professional upheaval, as he joined with his promotional partners at Golden Boy Promotions (GBP) and left longtime television home Home Box Office (HBO), to sign a six-fight, 30-month, deal with Showtime, which could earn him in excess of a quarter-million dollars, over its duration.
The number of fights is quite the jump from the six fights he’s had in the last six years. But, as part of that deal, Mayweather’s already well-financed and corporately-sponsored Golden Boy Promotions hooked up into a powerful promotional agreement, facilitated by the network, consisting of a wide-ranging, and multi-platformed, media blitz.
Using the synergy it has as its disposal, Showtime’s parent company, CBS, aired many commercial spots, especially during sporting events - and most notably throughout their coverage of the NCAA Men’s Basketball tournament, which garnered its best ratings in almost two decades, averaging over eight million viewers a day.
The “Tiffany Network” also aired a one-hour, L.L. Cool J-narrated, special entitled, Mayweather, last Saturday night. The feature, which helped to primarily promote Mayweather, as well as introducing Guerrero, may have been the high watermark for the sport’s promotion on national television, but its paltry ratings (1.89 million viewers, and the lowest rated primetime show on the network for the month of April), probably didn’t do too much to increase pay-per-view buys.
Showtime, itself, heavily pushed the bout in several forms including building up the MayDay hashtag, well prior to fight night, from its Twitter handle, @SHOSports. The subscriber-based channel also aired the one-hour 30 Days of May post-incarceration documentary, as well as the three-part documentary-styled hype show, All Access.
The latter program also aired in repeats on the all-sports cable outlet, CBS Sports Network, which did their part by airing live pre and post-fight press conferences, Friday’s weigh-in, and several past high-profile Mayweather fights, in addition to coverage on its various “talking heads” programs (such as Jim Rome’s ROME show) dedicating time to the main event.
The company’s still-virginal radio arm, CBS Sports Radio Network, was also quite busy airing interviews with the fighters, their camps, and boxing observers, as well as offering contests for tickets and trip giveaways to Las Vegas.
Both fighters had been quite ubiquitous when it came to promoting the bout, constantly making the rounds on most sports television and radio outlets, as well as mainstream shows. While both did their share of trash-talking on each other, during the build-up, the only real fireworks came from Guerrero’s father, Ruben, at Thursday evening’s press conference, held at the MGM Grand Hollywood. After a relatively pedestrian affair, filled with Golden Boy Promotions (GBP) pleasantries, the elder Guerrero stoked the fire in an animated fashion, calling out Mayweather for his past crimes:
"We're going to beat up that woman beater, the one that beat up his wife, man. His wife in front of his kids! You guys like that shit?!"
This led to Floyd Mayweather Senior attempting to go after Guerrero, before he was intercepted by GBP fighter/executive Bernard Hopkins. The younger Mayweather shook off Guerrero’s taunts, though the verbiage shouldn’t be unfamiliar to him. In the lead-up to the January 20, 2001 super-featherweight (130-pound) title tilt with Diego Corrales, Mayweather seared the late fighter over his being sentenced to 14 months in prison for assaulting his then-pregnant wife, Maria, saying, “I’m doing it for all of the battered women across America.”
Mayweather’s time in the Clark County Nevada Detention Center was noted for an appeal by the fighter, after twelve days, for an early release. Citing being “dehydrated” from a lack of water, a mere 800 calorie-a-day diet, and lack of training facilities. Justice of the Peace Melissa A. Saragosa denied the appeal, stating Mayweather’s issues were “self-induced,” adding he was the one who was choosing not to eat most of the prison food, and had ample ability to work out - even if he found the conditions beneath his normal standards.
Saragosa was also the judge that allowed Mayweather to serve out his sentence (along with a yearlong domestic violence counseling program) after his May 5, 2012 bout with Miguel Cotto - which, as of that decision, had not been booked yet. That decision was panned by many, as it was perceived to be favorable treatment due to the amount of revenue Mayweather’s fights bring into the state of Nevada, during those weekends. Chief Deputy District Attorney Lisa Luziach claimed they negotiated the fight after he was sentenced, arguing that fights get rescheduled frequently. Adding, “The court gave him until today to turn himself in and surrender and serve his sentence. The state’s position is that is that that’s what he should be doing today — turning himself in serve his sentence, just like anybody else would have to.”
During said bout, Mayweather dominated Cotto winning a 12-round unanimous decision, but excited viewers as he put himself in some peril late in the bout by standing in and exchanging with the Puerto Rican star, when he most certainly could have just fought defensively, and cruised to the victory.
A run-in with the law last month had actually caused the fight to be put in jeopardy - only this time it was by “The Ghost.”
On April 3, Guerrero was arrested, while boarding a flight at New York’s John F. Kennedy Airport, for illegally possessing an unlicensed, unloaded, handgun, and several high-capacity bullet magazines. Earlier this year, New York state upgraded its penalty for carrying an unregistered weapon from a class-A misdemeanor, into a class-E felony. Released on his own recognizance, the four counts Guerrero was charged with could carry up to a maximum of four years in prison. His next court hearing in Queens, New York, will be held on May 14.

In the main bout of the undercard, undefeated Mexican-born rising star Abner Mares stopped Daniel Ponce De Leon, in a slugfest, to win the World Boxing Council (WBC) featherweight (126-pound) championship, his third world title in his third weight division, in as many years.
Mares 26 (14)-0 (0), a former bantamweight (118-pound) and super-bantamweight (122-pound) champion, who was making his debut at featherweight, dropped De Leon late in the second round, and again with a right hand in the ninth. After the second knockdown, Mares trapped De Leon in the corner, and landed blows repeatedly, until referee Jay Nady jumped in - which some fans and observers believed he did too soon.
The two fighters combined to land 290 of 1,062 punches thrown in the nine rounds, with 275 of those being power shots (they threw 660, combined).
With the loss, De Leon’s record falls to 44 (35)-5 (2). He did rally back in the middle rounds of the bout, but was not able to hold up to the pressure of Mares, who is rapidly gaining steam to be recognized amongst the sport’s pound-for-pound elite.
De Leon, the second ranked 126-pound fighter in the world by The Ring magazine, had won the title last September via technical decision, when an accidental headbutt caused a premature stoppage, in the eighth round, against then-champion Jhonny Gonzalez.
In the second bout on the PPV undercard, super bantamweight (122-pound) Leo Santa Cruz remained undefeated with a lopsided pounding of former World Boxing Association (WBA) super-flyweight (115-pound) champion Alexander Munoz, via 5th-round TKO.
The Mexican-born 27-year old scored knockdowns in both the third and fifth rounds, and completely overwhelmed the smaller veteran, landing 219 of 424 punches (52%) - including 183 of 323 power punches (57%) - to claim the minor United States Boxing Association title, an International Boxing Federation-promoted belt.
With the victory Cruz, represented by Mayweather Promotions, raises his spotless record to 24 (14)-0 (0)-1 draw, while Munoz falls to 36 (28)-5 (1), marking the first time he’s ever been stopped.
In the first telecast fight on the pay-per-view portion of the broadcast, another Team Mayweather promoted prospect J’Leon Love rallied back from his first career knock down to squeek out a 12-round split decision victory over Gabriel Rosado, and claim the vacant North American Boxing Federation (a WBC-promoted minor) middleweight (160-pound) championship.
Facing his most difficult fight, to date, the 25-year old Roger Mayweather trained Michigan native was dropped with a counter over-hand right in round sixth, and had to rally back from shaky middle rounds to claim a split decision, that many boxing scribes and fans at ringside had thought was slightly in Rosado’s favor.
Two judges ruled the bout 95-94, one for each man, while judge Herb Santos scored the bout 97-92 in favor of Love, giving the Las Vegas-based fighter eight rounds, a decision which many observers disagreed with. “He (Santos) should lose his job, man.” Adding, “That’s crazy. How you going to score a fight 97-92 when I have a knockdown, and have him hurt several times?” asked Rosdao in disbelief, at the press conference.
Love now moves to 16 (8)-0, while the Philadelphia-based Rosado, 27, drops to 21 (13)-7 (2), losing his second fight in a row, following a January 19 TKO-7 loss to WBA 160-pound champion Gennady Golovkin at Madison Square Garden.SpaceX To Pay Special Tribute To Star Trek’s Jimmy Doohan

It's probably not appropriate often, but that just means that it's usually done with a custom compatison functor :) you still swap the smart pointers when sorting the collection. >. Item 6 - Exceptional C++ Style, Sutter. Specifically, I would suggest that Row is made swappable, by providing a global swap(Row&,Row&) function, which delegates to Row::swap(Row&) which swaps the refcountedptrs, which is very efficient thanks to a (public or private, doesn't matter) swap member. This means manipulating Row objects in containers is cheaper. Swap is a Good Thing, if it doesn't cost you anything or compromise your design, IMHO it's better to provide it than not. That said ... it ain't going to break mysql++ to leave it out, so I'll stop preaching. JonOctober 21st 2009 4:07 pm

You can close a group of dungeons with the minus to clean up the interface. This is helpful if you're trying to get your Outland dungeon achievements and don't want all of the others in the way when picking which ones you still need.
Now you're in the queue. At the top, you can see that the healer, tank, and dps options are now grayed out. You can't change any of your options without leaving the queue first.
This pops up when you mouseover the minimap icon for LFG. Here it shows how things are coming along with creating your group.
Here it will tell you what role you've been selected for as well as the rewards you'll be receiving for finishing the dungeon. This is your last chance to chicken out.
Once your group is ready in the queue and you've selected 'Enter Dungeon' you will get a box showing who you're waiting on and who has accepted by role. After everyone is ready, you are teleported directly into the instance it has randomly selected..
I copied my level 63 druid over to the PTR to see how the interface worked with someone of lower level. As you can see, the rewards for lower level characters aren't quite in yet.
You'll notice that Wrath dungeons aren't even an option for my level 63 druid. Let's go take a look at the specific dungeons.
As you can see, it only lists the available dungeons for my level 63 druid as the ones it is high enough level for.
Unfortunately, this feature is only partially implemented at the moment. The interface does not completely work and isn't actually attached to any of the the LFG tools.

ORTEGA, J.
Claimant seeks judicial review of a final order of the Employment Appeals Board (the board) denying his application for unemployment compensation on the ground that he voluntarily left work to avoid the possibility of being discharged. We review the board's order to determine whether substantial evidence supports the board's findings of facts, ORS 183.482(8)(c), and whether there is a rational relationship between those findings and the board's legal conclusion, Young v. Employment Dept., 170 Or App 752, 755, 13 P3d 1027 (2000). We affirm.
The following facts found by the board are supported by substantial evidence. Claimant began working for employer in the fall of 2006 as a high school language arts teacher. Less than six months into his job, claimant showed his senior class a 10-minute film clip depicting a dramatic monologue from the film "Glengarry Glen Ross." The clip, which contained some profanity, was intended as a lesson about language use and misuse. Claimant's action violated a policy of employer that required teachers to obtain the principal's permission before showing films containing profanity. As a result, claimant apparently was placed on administrative leave.
In February 2007, employer's personnel director informed claimant that, as a result of his actions, the director was going to recommend to the school board that claimant be dismissed. He told claimant that he could resign before the school board meeting. Claimant sought advice from his union representative and a union attorney, both of whom advised him to resign before he was dismissed. The union attorney also told claimant that the school board had never overruled a dismissal recommendation. Claimant resigned immediately before the March 2007 school board meeting at which his dismissal would have been recommended.
Claimant later sought unemployment benefits. The Employment Department denied his claim on the ground that he had been "discharged for misconduct." Claimant requested a hearing with an administrative law judge, who denied his claim on the alternative basis that, rather than having been discharged, claimant had voluntarily left work without good cause. Claimant then appealed to the board, which also found that claimant had voluntarily left work without good cause.
On review, claimant advances six assignments of error, four of which challenge the board's conclusion that he voluntarily left work without cause. Claimant contends that, because he resigned when his dismissal was imminent, he cannot be said to have voluntarily left work. Claimant asserts that such a resignation in lieu of discharge is no different than a discharge. Accordingly, claimant contends that the board should not have determined that he left work voluntarily. Moreover, claimant contends that, even if he did leave work voluntarily, he did so with good cause because he would have had no meaningful opportunity to challenge a dismissal. Claimant's remaining assignments of error challenge two findings that he contends are not supported by substantial evidence.
We begin by addressing claimant's assignments of error challenging the board's conclusion that claimant voluntarily left work without cause. A claimant who has been "discharged for misconduct connected with work" or who "voluntarily left work without good cause" cannot receive unemployment benefits. ORS 657.176(2)(a) and (c). OAR 471-030-0038(2) describes the difference between a voluntary leaving and a discharge:
"(2) The distinction between voluntary."
Substantial evidence supports the board's finding that claimant voluntarily left work. Claimant, not employer, ended the employment relationship. At the time of claimant's resignation, employer had not yet decided whether claimant could continue to work for some additional period. Indeed, claimant resigned his position shortly before the school board meeting at which the district's personnel director intended to recommend claimant's discharge. Moreover, it is not certain, even if that recommendation had been made, that the school board would have acted on the recommendation. Nothing in the record indicates that, at the time claimant resigned, employer had taken any actions that prevented claimant from working for an additional period of time.
We next consider whether claimant left work without "good cause." Good cause is a delegative term that the Employment Department has authority to interpret and refine by rule. See Springfield Education Assn. v. School Dist., 290 Or 217, 228-30, 621 P2d 547 (1980).). A claimant has the burden of establishing good cause by a preponderance of the evidence. Brotherton v. Morgan, 17 Or App 435, 438, 522 P2d 1210 (1974).
Here, the board concluded that claimant failed to establish good cause--that is, it concluded that claimant had the reasonable alternative to continue his employment while working to convince the school board to overrule the district's personnel director's recommendation that he be dismissed. The board's conclusion is supported by facts in the record. Claimant, who left his job in the first year of his employment, was a probationary teacher subject to dismissal for "any cause considered in good faith sufficient" by employer under ORS 342.835.(1) Although claimant contended to the board--as he does before this court--that, under ORS 342.835, employer could dismiss him for virtually any reason, that statute also guarantees claimant a hearing at which he could have argued against the personnel director's recommendation:
"."
Other evidence in the record demonstrates that, in later conversations with the school principal, claimant learned that other teachers had shown films with profane language without first obtaining permission from the principal and had suffered no adverse employment consequences. Although the record might have allowed the board to reach a different conclusion, the evidence is sufficient to support the board's conclusion that claimant had a reasonable alternative to voluntarily leaving work.
We turn briefly to claimant's two remaining assignments of error. He contends that two of the board's findings are not supported by substantial evidence: (1) that employer's film policy was contained in its employee handbook, and (2) that the school principal, in addition to the district personnel director, recommended claimant's dismissal. Claimant is correct. The only evidence in the record--claimant's testimony--demonstrates that the employee handbook does not contain the film policy. Likewise, the only evidence in the record--again, claimant's testimony--establishes that the district personnel director, not the principal, recommended claimant's dismissal. No evidence was offered to contradict claimant's testimony on those points. Although we are authorized to remand an order if we find "that the order is not supported by substantial evidence in the record," ORS 183.482(8)(c), the factual errors identified by claimant do not affect the critical determination that claimant voluntarily left work without good cause. Accordingly, remand is not appropriate.
Affirmed.
1. A "probationary teacher" is defined in ORS 342.815(6) as "any teacher employed by a fair dismissal district who is not a contract teacher." The parties agree that claimant was a probationary teacher; a "contract teacher," depending on the district, must have been employed for at least one year. ORS 342.815(3).
Return to previous location.When Nick Lowe resigned from his basketball coaching position at St. Francis de Sales following a 14-8 City League runner-up finish in 2010, he wasn’t sure he would ever coach again.
That uncertainty ended a year later, when the coaching post opened up at Bedford, where standout player Jackson Lamb had two years remaining in his career.
Lowe returned to the bench, Lamb turned in two all-state seasons, and the Kicking Mules reached some milestones together.
In 2011-12, Lowe guided the Mules to an 18-6 finish that concluded in the Michigan Class A regional final, setting a school record for the most wins by the boys team.
This season, the Mules finished 18-4, and posted an 11-1 record in the Southeastern Conference’s Red Division, giving Bedford its first boys basketball league title in school history.
For his contributions, Lowe is The Blade’s 2013 boys coach of the year.
Other top candidates included, St. John’s Ed Heintschel, who became Ohio’s 10th boys coach to reach 600 career wins en route to his Titans repeating as Three Rivers Athletic Conference champion, Bryan Borcherdt, who guided Anthony Wayne to its first Northern Lakes League crown since 1998, and Jim Bostdorff of Otsego, who led the Knights to their first league title since 2001.
“It was a time in my career where I felt like I really needed a break,” Lowe said of leaving St. Francis. “I was starting to get burned out, and I wasn’t enjoying it anymore."
Lowe, and his wife, Christie, have a son, 10, and daughter, 7.
“With a young family, things were up in the air," he said. "That changed a year later when the Bedford job opened. After discussing it with my family, I decided to pursue that job.”
“Looking back now, after two successful years, I’m very glad with the choice that we made. The success we’ve had isn’t just about me. We’ve had some very good assistant coaches, and some quality players in the program that we were able to lead.”
The talented 6-foot-6 Lamb averaged 26.0 points and 10.9 rebounds this season.
“Jackson Lamb is a once-in-a-lifetime player for a coach,” Lowe said. “When you’re talking about building a foundation and coming in new as a coach, obviously having a player the caliber of Jackson Lamb makes the transition easier.
“What I try to bring to the table more than anything is trying to get the most out of the kids. Trying to make them see that they can always play a little harder, or give a little more effort.”
Lowe, 41, a 1990 graduate of Central Catholic where he played for coach Bill Axe, earned his bachelor’s degree from the University of Toledo.
He began his coaching career early, returning to Central during his freshman year at UT to be an assistant coach for the Irish Gray (second-level) freshman team.
The following year he moved to Northwood to become an assistant under his own former Central freshman coach, Ron Estes, and then spent one season as freshman coach and six more as junior varsity coach while teaching at St. Francis.
Lowe became the Knights head coach in 2001-02, and in nine seasons posted a 113-68 record.
These days, Lowe owns his own business, M & W Silkscreen. When he began coaching at Bedford, he brought along former longtime St. John’s assistant Ed Mouch as an assistant.
The two former City League foes have blended well, with Lowe orchestrating the defense, and Mouch handling the Mules’ offense.
“When I came on the scene, obviously there were people in place that made this achievable,” Lowe said of Bedford’s milestones. “[Mules athletic director and former basketball coach] Mark German has done a terrific job helping me along, and educating me on Bedford basketball.
“The people here have had an appreciation for the players in particular. It really kind of hit home last Friday in our district final against Milan. We had over 1,700 in our gym. The community support has been tremendous.”HERBERT A. WHEELER
Oct. 31, 1928-Feb. 19, 2012
PIKEVILLE -- Herbert Alfred Wheeler, 83, Pikeville, passed away Sunday at Kitty Askins Hospice Center.
Born in Stantonsburg, he was the son of the late Joseph Stephen Wheeler and Gladys Fields Wheeler, and husband of the late Mary Williams Wheeler, his wife of 47 years.

China's foreign ministry has called the killing of Osama bin Laden a "landmark event" and a positive step for global anti-terrorism efforts. But in China's fast-growing and increasingly free-wheeling online community of more than 450 million people, opinions have been mixed, ranging from relief to mourning bin Laden's death.
In a spoof, which appeared online in China, shortly after the news broke, the narrator pays homage to the al Qaeda leader.
"Today we are here to deeply memorialize Osama bin Laden, the great soldier and founder of the International Islamic terrorist movement. He had a glorious life as a strategist, politician, financier and poet."
Other online comments seemed to genuinely mourn bin Laden's demise — comments such as, "yet another anti-American hero is lost" and "now the only terrorist left is the United States." Zhang Xin, the director of the state-run China Central Television's National Security and Military Channel, wrote "Bin Laden was the greatest national hero in Arab history. He used his own power to fight the most powerful country in the world, America."
What's all this about?
First, there's a vocal nationalistic minority online in China who like to call themselves "angry youth," and who see the United States, as the world's top power, standing in the way of what they see as China's rightful rise to the top. There's also a long-standing dislike in a larger part of the Chinese population for what's seen as American military adventurism — particularly in Iraq, though they're not wild about Libya, either.
But the prevailing view in my Beijing neighborhood seemed to be more like this one, from a middle-aged guy named Xie.
"So the guy's dead already. What impact does this have on China?" Xie said. "He didn't do any acts of terrorism in China, and there were no Chinese interests involved."
When I mentioned that some Chinese seemed to admire Bin Laden, Xie scoffed, saying, "Maybe the Uighurs" — the Turkic Muslims who live in the western region of Xinjiang — "but not Han Chinese." For himself? He said it's a non-event.
A young woman named Jin had a little more interest in the news. She said it has positive and negative sides.
"First, he's a terrorist. So as long as he's alive, people won't feel secure," Jin said.
However, she added that it would have been better to arrest and try him than to shoot him in the head. She said China, too, opposes terrorist attacks, but believes in human rights, and that even Osama Bin Laden deserved to be treated as a human being.
That level of concern hasn't been as much in evidence in China, at least in public, for the dozens of lawyers and activists who have disappeared or detained in recent weeks, in China's worst crackdown of its kind in decades. But a few sly comments, related to Bin Laden's death, have made it online. One said, "That's one of the world's top ten most evil people dead — nine more to go."
There are nine people on China's Politboro standing committee.61

LUBBOCK, TX—There has been a hike in HIV and AIDS diagnoses in Lubbock County, but not as much as the Texas Department of State Health Services announced.
According to the 2012 HIV Surveillance Report issued by the Texas Department of State Health Services, there were 26 new HIV diagnoses and 44 new AIDS diagnoses in Lubbock County, totaling 339 persons living with HIV/AIDS.
When we reached out to the Texas Department of State Health Services, they told us these numbers are incorrect, but that there still is a notable increase in AIDS diagnoses in Lubbock County, just not as large as the report reflected.
The accurate numbers are 29 new HIV diagnoses and 18 new AIDS diagnoses in Lubbock County in 2013, which is still the highest number of cases reported since 2003.
Jennifer Brown and her colleagues at Texas Tech Department of Psychological Sciences have noticed this increase and have started several research studies to try and figure out why it is happening.
“There’s a group of us here really interested in looking at and researching why there might be higher rates in Lubbock,” Jennifer Brown said. “There are a variety of factors that contribute to HIV rates, including substance use, behaviors that increase risk, like unprotected sex, and so likely there are some combinations of factors that contribute to the higher rates.”
Brown said that she hopes the results of these studies will allow Tech to develop some prevention services as well as getting people tested who are at a higher risk of HIV or other sexually transmitted diseases.Reviews:

METAPTATION:
A descriptive category for evolutionarily versatilepatterns of genetic and ontogenetic organizationby David G. KingDepartment of Anatomy and Department of ZoologySouthern Illinois University, Carbondale, IL 62901, U.S.A.(Abstract published in 1985, Evolutionary Theory 7:222)ABSTRACT Traits which create potential for efficient adaptive evolution are shaped by selection acting at the "second tier," at the level of differential speciation and extinction among lineages. Evolutionary versatility is not merely a fortuitous byproduct of certain adaptations. A lineage whose genomic organization has permitted effective evolutionary change in the past can pass this capacity, with additional modifications, along to descendent branches. One result of such selection has been a gradual refinement of mechanisms which influence the occurrence of viable hereditary variation, and hence the evolutionary acquisition by genomic information systems of an ability to facilitate their own evolutionary transformation.
"Metaptation" (from meta to change + aptation fitness) is offered as a name for evolved patterns of biological organization which promote evolutionary versatility by causing and constraining mutation and by ontogenetically accommodating to the consequences of mutation. Many mechanisms for actively encouraging genetic variation are already known to exist. Recognizing that such mechanisms have evolved for this role, selected on the basis of past contribution to evolutionary survival, offers a paradigm for investigating the nature of genetic and developmental function. Evolutionarily useful transformations may be explicitly coded by variable genes or genetic regulatory sequences. Organizational patterns which confer long term evolutionary versatility may be as sophisticated and as fundamental as the patterns which provide for immediate adaptive morphogenesis.

About this wikiHowLegal Question in Personal Injury in New York
I got into a car accident 2 weeks ago. To make a long story short, a woman ran a red light and hit my car and a public bus. This woman had no care and did not even come over to see if anyone was okay. I was rushed to the ER with a concussion and a deep laceration to my head. I now have a scar on my face, and massive headaches from the hit to the head/concussion. My boyfriend, also in the car is suffering severe back pain. She tried to say it was our fault, but the police report says that she ran the red light. Can I sue her?
6 Answers from Attorneys
It sounds like both you and your boyfriend have valid cases. Additionally regardless of who was at fault, you may be entitled to have your medical needs and lost wages, resulting from the accident, paid for by no fault car insurance. I regularly handle these cases. If you'd like to discuss this further feel free to give me a call at 1-888-FRISCH-LAW.
Yes, you can sue, provided you can support your claim for serious injuries under NY law. You need an experienced car accident lawyer to bring a successful claim. Feel free to contact my office for a free no obligation consultation at 718-616-1414.
There are several claims that can be filed. To begin with, you must file a No-Fault claim within 30 days, so that your medical/hospital bills are paid.

You and your boyfriend certainly seem to have valid claims if all of the information you are providing is accurate. It is critical that you and your boyfriend file a No-Fault claim within 30 days of the accident so that your medical bills and lost wages (if any) are to be paid. Failure to do so may result in a denial of benefits for you.
Additionally, you probably have a pain and suffering claim against the other driver, provided you meet the No-Fault threshold law of New York.

-Hardlinks are not restored on Solaris by NBU 7.0
Hello.
We're using NetBackup 7.0 with a Master & Media Server running on Windows Server 2003 and 7.0 clients on Sparc Solaris 10. After having done a larger test restore, I noticed that the restore contained A LOT fewer files then there should be.
Espec ially hard links are missing. For example, in the /usr/share/lib/zoneinfo/Africa directory, there should be:
--($ /usr/share/lib/zoneinfo/Africa)-- ls -lai As* 178026 -rw-r--r-- 2 root bin 74 2009-12-08 04:40 Asmara 178026 -rw-r--r-- 2 root bin 74 2009-12-08 04:40 Asmera
But in the restored directory, there's only:
--($ /SAN/restore-test/race-dev/snapshots/usr/share/lib/zoneinfo/Africa)-- ls -la As* -rw-r--r-- 1 root bin 74 2009-12-08 04:40 Asmara
As you can see, the "Asmera" file is missing; only the first encountered Asmara file had been restored. If you pay attention to the "ls -lai" output above, you'll see that those two files have the same inode number and thus the link counter is 2; IOW: those files are hard linked.
When I did the restore, I selected the top level "/" directory, so yes, all of the links should've been restored at the same time - but as can be seen, this didn't happen. I guess that's also the reason, why the restore completed with code 5 "the restore failed to recover the requested files"?
Backup and restore were done from/to a Solaris 10 server. We're using the ZFS filesystem, if that matters. I'm attaching screenshots showing the policy settings. As far as the backup selection window is concerned - I'm NOT backing up the / directory, but instead a /.backup directory which contains ZFS snapshots of the real filesystems. I verified that the hard links ARE present in the source snapshots.
What's going on there?
Thanks,
Alexander
Have you read this?...

Riaan Badenhorst
ITs easy :)
Riaan,
yes, I have read the note - sorry, should've mentioned this...
But I don't think the note is relevant in my case. As I understand the note, itŝ mainly only then important, if you do partial restores. But here, I'm trying to restore a complete backup; IOW: complete directories. And for that, the note states:
I find this not to be true...
But there's one thing in the note, which confuses me. Namely this:
Where should this setting be? I initiated the restore from the Windows master/media server.
Alexander
To restore a UNIX backup that contains soft and hard links, run the Backup, Archive, and Restore client interface from a UNIX machine. Only the Java version of the client interface contains the Rename hard links and Rename soft links restore options. Windows users can install the Windows display console to access the Java version of the Backup, Archive, and Restore interface from a Windows machine.

Dempsey Aaron Easley & Willie Mullins On their Wedding Day, 15 Aug 1907, Van Zandt County Submitted by Sibyl Creasey
Dempsey Aaron Easley was born 6 Dec 1884 in Van Zandt County in the Watts Community to William Littleton Easley and Mary Emaline Baker. He lived in the county all his life and died in Mother Frances Hospital in 20 Dec 1941 following a botched surgery. He was residing in Ben Wheeler at the time. He married Willie Mullins who was born 21 Feb 1887 in Overton, Smith County, Texas. She was the daughter of Jesse William Mullins and Alice Roslin Stone who settled in Edom, Van Zandt County, Texas, shortly after 1900. Dempsey and Willie "ran off" to be married. Willie's father was hopping mad and went after the couple riding a mule and carrying a shotgun. Fortunately for their vast number of descendants, the irate father never caught up with the couple.

Greggs Job Interview
This thread is sponsored by:
-
I went to a Greggs interview over a week ago. They ask you general questions (not particularly hard). Firstly,they want to know why you want to work for Greggs. Then they move onto other stuff. Like they want an example of where you worked as a team and what skills you needed...but then they go onto questions based on Greggs...like how you would greet a customer...how you would treat a new member of staff, how you think the manager should treat you. They also ask what things you think you will be doing at Greggs and ask about personal and food hygiene. It's not hard...but I didn't get the job (other people had more skills than me, despite the fact I have bakery experience...!).
Good luck though!!!
I had an interview with greggs it went:
Do you like sausage roles?
Yes.
And you put them in your mouth right?
Yes.

They will ask you to bake a pasty in the interview, then Gregg will come and taste it, if it isn't up to scratch then you can only work on the sandwiches section.

I had an interview with them just over a year ago, it was pretty easy, they asked me 10 simple maths questions, you had a calculator to check aswell you had to get over 80% right i think but they were simple..
they also asked me about what i would be willing to do including, making food and customer service examples and what is good customer service, to be honest i made a load of crap up and i got the job but i didnt take it as i had already been offered a job somewhere else.. hope it helps and good luck
Cheers Guys, it's only part time untill my applications goes off to the RAF. Will let you know how it goes
- OfflineReputationRep:
I posted this in a past thread on this subject:
I worked at Greggs for two years, starting off as a general assistant but going up the chain to assistant manager, and I got to look at the interview questions (I even got to sit in an interview once, but that was a management one for the purpose to find my replacement, so isn't that relevant to you.) A few points you might find useful;
- wear smart/casual - not suit and tie, but not jeans and trainers either.
- I know it sounds obvious, but make sure you've washed your hair, have clean nails and have had a shower & used deodorant before you arrive at the interview, because on the interview sheets where they write down in note form your replies to the questions, there's a section where they have to put down whether or not you look clean & presentable and have good hygiene - if you don't, then they have to put it down, and it'll probably make your chance of getting the job less likely! Especially when you consider that bad personal hygiene doesn't go very well in a food environment in particular!
- Greggs are very keen on their core values, and the whole interview is split into sections based on one or two at a time. These are; openness, honesty, fairness, respect, consideration, enthusiasm, supportiveness and being appreciative. Think to yourself what each of these mean to you (have a look on their website to get some help with this), and after you've been asked each question, think which of these values are relevant to it, and work them into your answer.
- Some questions I'm pretty sure they will ask you (unless they've completely changed the interview procedure since a year ago, which I doubt) are (they may be worded slightly differently);
* How would you expect to be treated by your manager? (with fairness, to have anything told to them in confidence to be kept to themselves, to be supportive if you come to them with problems, etc.)
* What hygienic procedures do you think are necessary in a food environment? (washing hands, not touching food with your bare hands, not reheating food, wearing clean uniform, tying hair back, cleaning as you go, wearing closed-toe shoes, wearing aprons...)
* How would your friends describe you? (Obviously I don't know you, but I do know that anything that fits in with the core values above is good , plus they are very, very keen on people who are flexible with their time, in particular, as well as punctual and reliable Being outgoing and good with people is good, too.)
* Give me an example of a time when you worked with others as part of a team to get to a specific target/conclusion.
- Remember that the interviewer is not 'out to get you' or trying to intimidate you - they genuinely want you to do well and will be doing their very best to put you at ease and put you in the best position you can be to answer their questions with confidence. They will help you as much as they are allowed, and if you look lost or unable to answer, you can ask them to rephrase the question.

His new novel, New Model Army, set in 2030, follows the rise of the world's first democratic armies, which use sophisticated social-networking software linked into personal consoles for troops to vote on all tactical decisions."I was struck how odd it was that although the UK and USA were democracies fighting Hitler and Mussolini, their armies were exactly as dictatorial and hierarchical as those of the nations they fought," says Roberts. "That got me thinking: what if an army run by dictators (generals) came up against a democratic army?"Wired put his military tactics in front of an expert panel.1. The battlefield wiki Roberts' soldiers use the wiki while on the move by talking, typing into a smart pad and annotating Google maps.How near are we? "The technology and the military thinking are already in place. Military scholars have been arguing the importance of networks for future conflict for more than a decade now," says cyber-conflict expert Athina Karatzogianni at the University of Hull. She points to John Arquilla and David Ronfeldt's concept of "netwar", whereby terrorists or activists, many of whom are in leaderless groups, can co-ordinate attacks online."The Iraq war was the first internet war, and showed an unprecedented transformation both in terms of how it was fought and how it was covered by the global media, by citizen journalists and alternative online publications and blogs."But social networking expert Professor Kathleen Carley at Carnegie Mellon University warns: "With increased ability to enter information comes the ability to enter misinformation. And there are cases where the crowd is not wise, but biased."2. The Democratic Army Hierarchy-free armies vote on every action they make.How near are we?

"Al-Qaeda's 'cells', operate independently but are inspired by an ideology."3. The Firewall "Our wiki firewalls get cleverer and more responsive every time the enemy tries to hack them," writes Roberts. "These ADAP patches and softwares integrate themselves into the fabric of the wiki communication itself; they're alive, canny." How near are we? "While we can think about intelligent firewalls that auto-adapt, we can also think about hacking software that auto-adapts," says Carley. "And low-tech can often overcome high-tech.

Last December, the New York Times reported on Tourre's role in helping create Abacus deals, which allowed investors to bet for or against mortgage securities through credit default swaps: Moody's Investors Service, a credit rating agency, to assign a higher rating to one part of an Abacus C.D.O. but were having trouble, according to the investor's notes, which were provided by a colleague who asked for anonymity because he was not authorized to release them. Goldman declined to discuss the selection of the assets in the C.D.O.'s, but a spokesman said investors could have rejected the C.D.O. if they did not like the assets...

The Columbus Dispatch - March 01, 2014 03:42 PM
"
Into the woods, it's time to go,
I hate to leave, I have to, though.
Into the woods – It's time, and so
I must begin my journey…
Into the woods and down the dell,
The path is straight, I know it well.
Into the woods, and who can tell
What's waiting on the journey?
- Lyrics from Into the Woods
Shadowbox Live didn’t just go "into the woods" when it decided to restage
its last ill-fated musical.
The brash troupe veritably barged into the forest and chopped down several trees to make Into the Woods fit its needs and its Sunday-musicals audience.
But did it really have to go so far?
John Boyd as the "Maker" and Leah Haviland as the ‘Maker’s wife" in Shadowbox Live’s steampunked version of the musical Into the Woods. Credit: Shadowbox
The goal of Shadowbox’s "steampunk"-themed version of the Stephen
Sondheim and James Lapine musical – to extend the show’s central metaphor perhaps past its breaking
point – was to drag the trees well outside of any
Woods that any Sondheim fan has ever visited before and mill the lumber into building
blocks for some kind of steam-powered neo-Victorian contraption.
But when Music Theatre International, which handles the rights for Sondheim musicals, got "steamed" about Shadowbox cutting down the nearly three-hour musical, it was Shadowbox that ended up getting "punked."
Given the option by Music Theatre International to continue doing the
Broadway musical without cuts, Shadowbox instead opted to close the show after its sole
opening-night performance Feb. 16.
Shadowbox should have known they’d run into serious trouble, given the extent of their cuts and their changes in a few characters’ names and motivations.
"We knew we were taking a risk," Stacie Boord, director of community relations for Shadowbox, told me for the Dispatch news story I wrote last week about the show’s cancellation.
But it was more than a risk.
In my opinion, it was foolhardy to mess to such an extent with such a well-known musical – especially one co-created by Stephen Sondheim, a notorious stickler for insisting that his shows be performed as he conceived and intended them.
Shadowbox might have avoided the problem if it had simply asked permission in advance for the cuts it wished to make to fit its two-shows-on-Sunday schedule.
Shadowbox might have taken the prospect of cancellation more seriously if it had checked into the history of similar disputes.
Admittedly, contract violations that prompt outright show cancellations are relatively rare in central Ohio.
In my 28+ years covering theater and the arts for the Dispatch, I only recall or could find two potentially similar incidents, but they are instructive.
Annie at Columbus Children’s Theatre
When Columbus Children’s Theatre produced Annie in 1994, Producing Director Bill Goldsmith created a digital score for the musical to create a full sound otherwise impossible because of limited space for a live orchestra.
The Monday after the show opened, Goldsmith received a call from the vice president of Music Theatre International.
"He said, `We understand that you are using recorded music for the show. That is illegal and we are going to shut you down.’ I said, `Wait a minute,'" Goldsmith told Dispatch staff writer Ken Gordon, my colleague in Life & Arts, who helped research such background context for my Dispatch news story.
After a discussion, Columbus Children’s Theatre agreed to write a letter promising not to give the score to anyone else and destroy it after the production.
"What I learned is if you want to make changes, check with the publisher first," Goldsmith said.
"They don’t necessarily want to shut you down."
Private Lives at The Theatre Project
The Theatre Project, a short-lived small theater troupe in the early 1990s, wasn’t so fortunate.
The troupe was forced to cancel its fall-season-opening 1993 production of Private Lives, Noel Coward’s romantic comedy about two heterosexual couples.
The gay-oriented theater group contended, at the time, that the issue involved censorship - because of the group's nontraditional casting, which shifted Coward’s two married couples into an all-male ensemble.
The playwright's agent said it was simply a matter of money.
"We caught them stealing the play," Charles Van Nostrand, president of Samuel French Co., a New York theatrical rights agency, said in my 1993 Dispatch story.
"Royalties are normally cleared well in advance of a production, with any significant change in a copyright work approved by the author or owner. But they never applied for the rights."
Samuel French had no record, Van Nostrand said, of having received a check from the Theatre Project. He added that Private Lives' gender-switched, nontraditional casting was "not an issue that's been addressed."
Significantly, however, the troupe never informed Samuel French of its plans to switch the genders in its casting. If it had asked for permission, and had confirmed that its payment was received, things might have turned out different for the production and certainly better for the company, which later folded.
Into the Woods at Shadowbox Live
Into the Woods, one of my favorite Sondheim musicals, intricately weaves multiple stories and characters into a tapestry of lessons about life and loss.
One of the most abiding themes explored by Sondheim and Lapine is the need to take responsibility for one’s choices and their consequences. (That’s something that Shadowbox is painfully doing right now.)
As many of the lyrics to Woods make clear, venturing into the forest of life is always risky. You never know what you might find on your journey, whether you’ll get lost, or worse, lose something or someone dear.
The short-lived life and abrupt death of Shadowbox’s misconceived version of Into the Woods offers lessons for central Ohio theaters: First, get permission! And second, think twice before you mess with a classic.
One
Dispatch reader wondered whether Shadowbox might as well have gone farther and changed the
name of its version of the show from
Into the Woods to
Enter the Forest. Actually, even that wouldn’t have gone far enough to escape the problems
that arose.
Yet, that reader might have been onto something. After all, Shadowbox was always free to pursue two alternative paths:
* Ask for permission in advance to make script revisions tailored to its audience – and then proceed with the show if permission was granted, or if not, "move on" to a different musical (as it happens, a highly recommended Sondheim option)
* Or instead, create its own fractured fairy-tale musical.
The latter option isn’t just theoretical, since most characters in Into the Woods are so old that copyright issues don’t apply. If Disney can come up with its own stories about Cinderella, Rapunzel, witches and other fairy-tale icons, then so could Shadowbox.
Not that the results necessarily would have a great likelihood of equaling Into the Woods, one of the most accessible and popular musicals of Sondheim’s later career and a piece that I think many Shadowbox patrons might have warmed to, if they’d been given a serious opportunity to really see it.
Given Shadowbox’s track record of company-created musicals, though, the wisest strategy for the resident ensemble company might be to find its own characters and stories – especially ones that avoid inviting any direct comparisons to well-known Broadway or London hits.
Revivals versus revisals
Of course, copyrights issues and contract disputes don’t arise for very old plays and musicals.
Any theater company can make any changes it wishes to Shakespeare or Sheridan or Shaw or Sophocles (I’m running out of S’s...) or any other playwrights whose works pre-date the 20 th century.
Updating Julius Caesar to a black-leather-clad Fascist Italy to draw out the modern parallels worked brilliantly for wunderkind director Orson Welles in the mid-1930s. Similar later updates of Shakespeare – as Actors’ Theatre of Columbus has often done – can also work well, even if they’re not as original.
But theaters and directors always must take care with any revivals that cross the line into "revisals."
After all, changing Gypsy from the era of vaudeville and burlesque to today’s Internet and Netflix entertainments would be a disaster. (Just shouting at the cast to "sing out" more wouldn’t work and I don’t think "Everything’s coming up Google" would be as memorable a lyric.)
Updating the shipboard romances of Anything Goes to the Love Boat era likely wouldn’t work either.
When it comes to revivals, just anything doesn’t go.
Arbitrarily tampering with a play’s era or character can come across like mere defacement. For a revival to work with serious updates or cutting or other revisions, the concept must be well-considered and deeply rooted in the logic – and the psychologic – of the story and its themes. (In that respect, I don’t think Shadowbox’s "steam-punk" approach made the most sense.)
Shadowbox’s lessons
Thinking about everything that's happened over the past week and
considering all my conversations with Shadowbox leaders and the many Dispatch readers who've
commented on my story, I don’t see why Shadowbox couldn’t find success in its Sunday-musicals
series by selectively staging some other well-known musicals just as they are meant to be staged.
Finding a fresh angle for its own sake is not only a strategy that can backfire but it also can be superfluous when a musical is wonderful just as it is. (For example, take Sondheim. Take almost any Sondheim.)
Certainly, Shadowbox has the singers and actors who can do many musicals well if granted the opportunity.
For instance, there are still lots of rock- or rock-influenced musicals that Shadowbox hasn’t done yet, from Grease and Pippin to Bye Bye Birdie, The Wiz and Spring Awakening. (American Idiot surely must be on Shadowbox’s short list, if only because the Green Day rocker is so short as a 90-minute one-act.)
Perhaps a few shows might not fall that easily within the troupe’s talent "wheelhouse," but surely several well-known shows could be staged to popular acclaim without being cut down at all. (If a show happens to time out at more than 2 1/2 hours, including intermission, why not just warn audiences about that in advance while emphasizing all the reasons why the show is worth seeing? I believe many Shadowbox patrons would be willing to take a chance on something a bit different, while such productions might expand the troupe’s audience beyond its core.)
Overall, I wonder whether Executive Director Stev Guyer and other Shadowbox leaders aren’t underestimating their audience – at least, to some extent.
Certainly, Shadowbox wouldn’t have gotten as far as it has without paying extraordinary attention to the tastes of its growing audience. And that audience does include many people who aren’t traditional theatergoers, so the troupe is right to consider its shows carefully. What CATCO or Short North Stage pick for a musical isn’t what necessarily will work at Shadowbox.
Yet, ovver time, every theater and its audience undergo a mutual learning curve. Shadowbox’s audience has grown – and continues to grow not just in numbers, but also in taste and sophistication, which brings with it greater curiosity and tolerance for a broader range of shows.
Shadowbox ought to test and stretch its audience every now and then, as other theater companies strive to do.
Shadowbox leaders say they have to cut down their Sunday musicals to no more than about 2 to 2 1/4 hours, suggesting that longer shows would be too much for its audience’s patience. (Not to mention exhausting its cast members, who do have to perform musicals twice on Sundays and many other types of shows throughout each week at Shadowbox, perhaps the busiest performing-arts group in town.)
But Shadowboxers also often proudly note how loyal their audience is, how close a bond their audience has forged with troupe members. Doesn’t that suggest that many patrons might be willing to sample something different every now and then, and that most are willing to show up to enjoy whatever the troupe is producing?
In my Dispatch story about the cancellation of Into the Woods, Guyer voiced concerns that Shadowbox might have to limit its plans to do other musicals – especially those that might be too long for the Shadowbox schedule and audience.
It seems to me that Shadowbox Live has nurtured its audience over the years to such an extent that many are ready to enjoy a musical every now and then that falls a little outside the current template.
So I encourage Shadowbox - and other area troupes - to take more careful risks and venture "into the woods" again with exciting shows that just might find an appreciative audience.Full name Leonard George Colbeck
Born January 1, 1884, South Harrow, Middlesex
Died January 3, 1918, off the Cape of Good Hope in HMS Ormonde (aged 34 years 2 days)
Major teams Cambridge University, Europeans (India), Middlesex
Batting style Right-hand bat
Education Marlborough College; Cambridge University
2nd Lieut. Leonard George Colbeck (R.F.A.) MC died at sea off the Cape of Good Hope. A classical scholar, he excelled at cricket, rackets and hockey. He returned from India to enlist, won the Military Cross
He had a fine record as a batsman at Marlborough, but his name will live in cricket history by reason of the extraordinary innings he played in the University match of 1905. Going in for the second time against a balance of 101 runs Cambridge lost six wickets for 77, and looked to be a hopelessly beaten side. At this point Colbeck, in with the score at 11, was joined by McDonnell, and in the course of 85 minutes the two batsmen put on 143 runs together, completely pulling the match round. McDonnell kept up his wicket while Colbeck hit on the off-side with amazing brilliancy. The partnership recalled the memorable stand made for Cambridge in the 1870 match by Yardley and J. W. Dale. Colbeck took all sorts of risks, cutting balls off the middle stump to the boundary, but his eye served him so well that he was very rarely at fault. He hit thirteen fours in his 107 and was batting for two hours and a quarter. Like Yardley in 1870 he had his reward, Cambridge in the end winning the match by 40 runs. Colbeck had splendid figures for Cambridge in 1908, scoring 552 runs with an average of 42, but when tried in half-a-dozen matches for Middlesex in 1906 he did very little. He played one innings of 46 and another of 30 but on all other occasions he failed dismally. In 1906, however, he again did very well for Cambridge, scoring 63 and 44 against Oxford at Lord's, and heading the University batting with an average of 39. Against W. G. Grace's XI at Cambridge he played an innings of 175 not out.Modest Mouse: Interview
Dead Animals in the Field
In
the song "Float On," the opening lyric is about backing into a parked cop car
that eventually just drives away. It's a nice metaphor for the rise of this
indie-alternative rock band from Washington enjoyed last year, the car being
popular culture and it driving away being that culture telling everyone about
this "new" band they just discovered.
Accidentally being famous can be trying for anyone (ask that Steve Bartman kid
from Chicago). But Modest Mouse has been able to float on with their new found
mainstream success, showing no indication that this will go to their head. In
fact, it's possible they are a little oblivious as to how popular they have
become.
Bassist Eric Judy took time out to briefly chat about the rise of Modest Mouse
and about his favorite animal costume.
Your tour recently started. How has it been going?
It's been good. Last night was our first show and it was a bit rough. The
sound just wasn't right so we're gonna try to redeem ourselves with the next
show. We're having a long sound check today.
Congratulations on the two Grammy nominations. What were you doing when you
heard the news?
I don't really remember. I think I might just been home and our manager
called.
Were you surprised at the nomination?
It's really exciting and a once in a lifetime experience. We don't have high
hopes in winning. I really don't expect to win at all. If for some weird reason
we were to win, we'll probably just walk up there and bumble around.
How did it feel last year going from a band few knew about to a band being
played on MTV almost every day?
I don't think any of us were expecting to have that sort of success.
Do you think the two singles were written for the radio or that people's taste
in music changed?
Mainstream music shifts over time. It seemed like last year was truly a year
for more indie rock type bands to have some success.
Does the success add pressure to a future album?
Not for me, though it might be different for the other guys. For me, I feel
the opposite. We've had one really commercially successful album. We can do
whatever the fuck we want. I can brag about that album for the rest of my life.
Has the band written anything new?
No. There were a few songs that were left unfinished that we started recording,
but we don't have any new songs. I think right now with any bit of practice
time, we're trying to bring back older songs. We won't start on new songs till
the summer.
What old songs are you bringing back?
We just started playing "Dramamine" again and yester were going over "Tiny
Cities Made of Ashes." That one has been rearranged. It's going to be fun. There
are a few others too.
A lot of your songs have pretty ambiguous meanings. Do you ever get tired of
people hounding you about what they mean?
I don't. Issac gets that a lot, so I'm sure he gets tired of that. That's
his department. I kinda have my own little fun when I try to guess at what some
of them mean. But I never ask him. I like figuring out my own meanings.
When did you know you wanted to be in a band?
From the earliest I can remember, I just loved music. When I was a teenager,
I decided to buy a bass because I didn't know anyone else who played a bass. It
just seemed like a neat thing to do. Then I met Issac and Jeremy and that's the
first band I was in. And we're still a band.
What was your favorite Modest Mouse album and why?
The Lonesome Crowded West. That's recently come to me. I've been
listening to that over again over the last few months. I think that's a good
record. Sure it has certain memories with it, but after a certain time, you're
able to have an objective point of view. It's a really weird record and I'm glad
we made it.
How are you handling fame and signing autographs for people?
That's not a new thing with this record, just more of it. I don't freak out
anymore. I sign stuff for people all the time. I got used to doing it. At first
I would be "Man, that's really weird. Why would you want me to sign something
for you?" Now I think it's weird if I say no.
Where do the ideas for the music videos come from? Is it the band, is it the
director?
With "Float On," I think that was the director's idea. With "Oceans," it was
a combination of Issac and the director. There was this theme of someone being
dragged around dead. Then it changed to dead animals in the field. I was a
squirrel with a broke arm. I was going to be a badger, but a squirrel was more
believable in terms of being nursed back to health.
Do you guys where those suits during the life show?
No we don't. Those suits were pretty neat though.
I also read you will be at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee this summer.
That's funny. It was one of those things where nobody knew about it. Someone
happened to see it listed and that's how we found out. It was a happy surprise.
I don't even know who else is going to be there.
Drive-by Truckers, Dave Mathews Band, and John Prine to mention a few.
John Prine? I like that guy. This is more exciting now.
One last question. Who would win in a fight? A modest mouse or a mighty mouse.
I just don't know. We have six people, so I would say us. Yea.
We were saying you too, but no one would know because you would be too modest.
Yea, that's right.Defendant in sex slave case to change plea

KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) — One of six people accused of sexually trafficking a southwest Missouri woman is scheduled to change his not-guilty plea on Tuesday, two weeks after a federal prosecutor said she wasn’t going to present evidence he tried to hire a hit man to kill her.
Bradley Cook, 33, of the St. Louis suburb of Kirkwood, is facing seven federal counts in Missouri’s Western District, five of which involve claims he tried to hire someone to kill his accuser while he was being held in a federal detention facility in Leavenworth, Kan. Prosecutors also have alleged in court documents that he tried to hire a hit man to kill Assistant U.S. Attorney Cynthia Cordes.
Cook is facing conspiracy and sex trafficking charges involving a woman who said she was a teenager when she moved into the rural Lebanon trailer of co-defendant Edward Bagley and his wife, Marilyn, who also has been charged. The accuser said she was used as a sex slave for years and came to authorities only after going into cardiac arrest following a torture session.
Cook also is charged with use of an interstate facility to facilitate unlawful activity, attempted tampering with a victim, attempted tampering with a witness, use of an interstate facility in commission of murder for hire and attempted witness retaliation. Each of those crimes carries a maximum sentence ranging from 10 to 30 years in prison.
Prosecutors alleged in court documents in January that Cook tried to hire someone to kill the victim and Cordes, the office’s top human trafficking prosecutor, late last year. Last month, U.S. Magistrate Robert Larsen ruled that evidence of the plot against Cordes could not be presented at Cook’s trial unless the prosecutor removed herself.
Cordes responded that she would continue prosecuting the case and would not present evidence of the alleged murder-for-hire plot against her.
In Missouri’s Eastern District, Cook is facing a charge of owning guns while being a marijuana user.
Cook’s attorney, Carter Collins Law, acknowledged Tuesday’s change-of-plea hearing but declined to comment further.
Two other defendants, James Noel and Dennis Henry, have pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion.
Noel admitted going to Bagley’s home on several occasions to watch and take part in torture sessions in which the woman was shocked with homemade sex devices.
Henry, a former Nevada, Mo., postmaster, admitted taking part in the torture sessions, having sex with the woman and accompanying Bagley and the woman to California for a fetish photo shoot that resulted her appearing on the cover of 2007 issue Taboo magazine, a bondage-fetish publication.
In addition to the trafficking charge, Henry pleaded guilty to transporting the victim across state lines for sexual activity.
The sex trafficking charge has a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
The U.S. attorney’s office in Kansas City declined to comment about the case. attorney, Susan Dill, said she didn’t think Cook’s plea would have an impact on her case.

Così, Inc. Reports 2013 First Quarter Results
DEERFIELD, IL - May 16, 2013 - Così, Inc. (NASDAQ: COSI), the fast casual restaurant company, today reported a net loss for the first quarter ended April 1, 2013 of $(2,741,000), or $(0.15) per basic and diluted common share, compared with the net loss of $(1,128,000), or $(0.09) per basic and diluted common share, reported for the 2012 first quarter. The calculated loss per share for both quarters reflects the impact of the reverse stock split that was effected on May 9, 2013.
Così's total revenues for the 2013 first quarter decreased by $3,112,000 to $21,561,000 from $24,673,000 in the 2012 first quarter. Company-owned net restaurant sales decreased by $3,067,000 to $20,854,000 from $23,921,000 for the 2012 first quarter. Franchise fees and royalty revenues for the quarter contributed $707,000 compared to $752,000 in the 2012 first quarter. The decline in revenues compared to last year's first quarter was due primarily to the closure of company-owned and franchise locations subsequent to the first quarter of 2012, the decline in comparable Company-owned store sales and lower royalties resulting from a decrease in comparable franchise restaurant sales.
System-wide comparable restaurant sales for the first quarter as measured for restaurants in operation for more than 15 months recorded an aggregate decline of 4.5% as compared to the first quarter of 2012. The breakdown in comparable sales between Company-owned and franchise-operated restaurants are as follows:
For the 13 weeks ended
April 1, 2013
Company-owned (6.6%)
Franchise-operated (1.3%)
Total System (4.5%)
"We have taken several steps to strengthen the Così brand, including the launch of the "pop up" pilot location last December, and the opening of our new location in Columbus, Ohio next month. Our focus on operational improvement is gaining traction as evidenced by the comparable store sales growth in our New York City market. Despite these "wins", our overall first quarter results were unacceptable. In the end, profitable sales must be the measure of our success, and on that measure we have not succeeded," said Carin Stutz, Così's President and Chief Executive Officer. "While we will continue with our emphasis on operational excellence, we are re-evaluating our ability to simply operate our way back to profitable growth. A number of our units continue to drag down our portfolio of company-owned stores. We recognize that our current financial performance may not allow us either the time or resources to build our brand and accelerate our franchise growth while fixing these underperforming units. We do have a core of well-performing, profitable locations that prove to us that there continues to be great value in the Così concept. Our franchisees continue to perform well. Their performance suggests that the franchise model may offer superior financial results while requiring less investment capital to fund Così's growth. An emphasis on franchising would also allow Così to further reduce its cost structure. All of this is driving us to carefully re-evaluate our entire portfolio of restaurants, to consider which should be closed or refranchised. Our mission is to reconfigure our assets so that we have a long-term, sustainable business that can support the growth of the Così brand."
2013 First Quarter Financial Performance Review
Così's aforementioned $3,067,000 decrease in first quarter Company-owned net sales as compared to the 2012 first quarter was due primarily to a $1,597,000 decline in net sales from six locations closed subsequent to the first quarter of 2012 as well as a 6.6% decrease in comparable restaurant net sales. The decrease in Company-owned comparable net sales during the quarter was comprised of an 8.5% decrease in traffic partially offset by a 1.9% increase in average guest check.
For the first quarter, Così reported a 590 basis point increase in costs and expenses related to Company-owned restaurant operations as a percentage of restaurant net sales compared with the first quarter of 2012. The change resulted from increases of 220, 210 and 160 basis points, as a percentage of net sales, in occupancy and other restaurant operating expenses, labor and related benefits expense and the cost of food and beverage, respectively. The increase in occupancy and other restaurant operating expenses and labor and related benefits expense as a percentage of net sales was due primarily to the deleveraging impact of the comparable restaurant net sales decline on the fixed portion of these costs during the period. The increase in the cost of food and beverage as a percentage of net sales was largely due to higher costs on certain commodities, primarily poultry and produce, the increased usage of fresh vegetables primarily in our new bowl products which launched at the beginning of the year and the launch of the new bowl category which has a higher than average cost when compared to the other entrée categories for lunch and dinner.
During the first quarter of 2013, the Company reduced its general and administrative expenses by $22,000, to $2,757,000 or 12.8% of total revenues from $2,779,000 or 11.3% of total revenues in the 2012 first quarter.
Così reported that as of April 1, 2013 it had cash and cash equivalents of $12,136,000 and virtually no debt other than lease obligations. 74 Company-owned and 50.The Washington Post carries an interesting piece by former National Repubican Committee chief Ed Gillespie that argues the GOP's salvation lies not in Washington but in the states.
This comes, of course, on the heels of disasterous polling numbers for the Republican brand following the debacle in DC over the debt ceiling, the shutdown, sequestration, etc.
And it's easy to understand national GOP leaders looking for bright spots. I'd only note PA's not among them.
Gillespie, for example, argues that Republican governors are enjoying "remarkable" approval ratings and "getting things done."Sale

Starting at: !This Friday Fringe will end its somewhat improbable five season run of exploring alternate universes, time travel, mutant freaks, mad scientists, and pretty much every other fun science fiction trope except for extraterrestrials with a proper two hour series finale. Fringe, surprisingly, was given one final renewal for this fifth and final thirteen episode season. Before that, the show’s status was so tenuous that two different final scenes for Season Four were filmed: one to be aired in case the season finale turned out to be the series finale and one to be aired if the show was renewed.
Season Five has been somewhat divisive among the Fringe fan community. Much like the controversial final season of Lost, the writers have chosen to use the final season to focus on a story set in yet another alternate version of reality with alternate versions of our beloved characters who are (arguably) not the same people who we’ve come to love and care about for the length of the series thus far. In the final episode of the series before the finale, “The Boy Most Live,” the show made a promising move to address some of these concerns and unify the current iterations of the characters with the ones we know and love so to speak. For the finale itself, it looks like the writers are engaging in as much of what critics like to call “fan service” as they possibly can. The final two hours look to have callbacks to virtually every fan favorite character, concept, and episode from the entire run of the series as well as copious references to this really being the end, lots of crying and goodbyes etc.
As ace AV Club TV recapper Noel Murray notes above, Fringe also looks poised to join the ranks of the many science fiction shows that end with a “the Fifth Element is love” type of resolution. (Come to think of it, that’s what the Season Four finale ultimately was as well.) Most science fiction sagas end with some sort of love conquers all message or else some move towards religion or mysticism. And from some hints last week and from this trailer, Fringe looks likely to go a similar route. Still, whatever happens with the finale I think Fringe fans should be happy that they got far more of the show than it seemed likely they’d get at many points, and bask in how far the series has come since it’s humble beginnings as an undistinguished X-Files clone.

Why I’m breaking the cycle of violence in Afghanistan
ByI never realized how devastating our culture was for women until my brother-in-law tortured my sister. Growing up in Afghanistan, I had already watched my father beat my mother—but that was seen as just another part of daily life. Then the cycle of violence continued when I myself became an abuser. — January 28, 2013 more ».

we all know inquisition, and that the fact it costs were that of one templars verdirct, but hardly producing dmg+ worth one tamplars verdict the following 30seconds.
finally they removed that shit "math says its more dmg overall" button.
___
now they introduce a talent, that is EVEN FAR MORE mathematical bonus ...
you spend 5 holypower (which is kind of 1 and 2/3rds of a buffed (when you choose final verdict instead) templars verdict to boost a percentage of your current stats. even if that was a 100%buff of current stat, you wouldnt get that much dmg out of 8.5remaining seconds to do THAT MUCH burst. for it to be more dmg, it must be a very rough burst buff just to make its costs worth of those 2-2/3rd templars verdict ...
____
solutions:
remove that damn buffs ... rets have enough short time buffs (avenger, wrath and now again seraphim instaed of ancient ...) ret is so buff dependant already, we dont need any more short time burst buffs.
in the end, the ret needs to activate all of them simultaneously to achieve what others achieve with one - just because ret HAS 3 of them ... merge everything into ONE or maybe two.
sometime class design at blizz doesnt feel like design, just like a happens to be process ...
____
if id design paladin/ret it would look like this:
all burst cds get romoved. one replaces them for all classes: seraphim. (prot: dmg inc reduced by 20% ontop of the other effects - holy: enhancing healing and shielding done by 20% on top of the other effects - ret reducing ability cd by 20% on top of the current effects) that one needs 5 hopo, but doesnt consume them! has a 3minute cooldown, to do what it shall do in wod.
in talenttree there its possible to skill ONE further, and that is "holy avenger" that one will be redisigned to just empower hp generation, no buffs to the dmg whatsoever. therefore it lasts 10sec, but only has a 1minute cooldown.
thats all id like to see for paladin/ret "burst buffs" its sufficient and does all without combining 2 or more abilities to each other to get the full effect
now those one ( or two if skilled) buffs should be designed around having just those ... not around combining them, casue some wont combine them!
____
ability bloat on the one hand magically didnt stop blizz from implementing even MORE fuckin shorttime buffs for the paladin gameplay on the other hand.friendly staff and locals , excellent food and comfy modern rooms with air conditioning ,perfect for the humid summer months .

‘Happy Endings’ Star Adam Pally on His Favorite Bands, From Beck to NKOTB
Find out what song got the actor suspended from Hebrew school. And the last song on it was “Freedom” by Rage Against the Machine, which has a minute of Zack de la Rocha screaming, “Fuck you, I won’t do what you tell me!” Suspended, instantly. Hebrew day school. They’re all up in your biz.
What song would you like played at your funeral?
Part of me wants to end with a bit and say “Peaches” by Presidents of the United States of America. And part of me wants to say [James Taylor’s] “Something in the Way She Moves.” So I’ll say both of those. Keep an eye on me, because I could go at any second.
If you were to portray a musician in a biopic —
Billy Joel.
Wow, you were ready with that. Why?
Because he’s the greatest songwriter that ever lived. I love Billy Joel. I cry sometimes when I hear The Stranger. “You May Be Right” may be one of the greatest songs ever written.
You may be right.
You may be crazy. Jeff Tweedy would also be a good one. I feel like I could pull that off. We have similar painkiller addictions.
What were you listening to the first time you smoked pot?
I think Bone Thugs-N-Harmony. I smoked pot pretty young, so I could’ve been with my uncle listening to [James Taylor’s] “Fire and Rain.” I also got high with my cousin around 12, and we drove around in his Honda Accord during Passover listening to [Led Zeppelin’s] “When the Levee Breaks” over and over, like three times, and that’s a nine-minute song.
What song do you associate with your first kiss?
“Kiss From a Rose” by Seal, because it was around the time that the third Batman was big. I was making out with Miriam Feldman at my buddy’s bar mitzvah. Her parents were not happy.
Who comes after Radiohead on your iPod?
Reggie Watts, followed by Rick Ross.
Whose music has helped you over a breakup?
Beck’s Mellow Gold. I actually ended up marrying the girl that I broke up with.
Do you have a go-to karaoke song?
If I’m looking to annoy everybody in the room, which I often am, I’ll do the Police’s “Can’t Stand Losing You” because the last two minutes of that song are just “I can’t, I can’t, I can’t stand losing” over and over again.
Name a playlist on your iPod..”
What’s the first concert you ever attended?
New Kids on the Block.
That’s funny, I didn’t think NKOTB had any male fans, but [Breaking Bad‘s] Aaron Paul recently said the same thing.

Museum-quality art can often be found at LoDo's Robischon Gallery. Rarely, though, are the gallery's three display spaces all devoted to the work of a single artist, as they are in the current exhibit John Buck--New Work.
The special treatment is warranted, given Buck's formidable artistic output of the last few years--in particular, those works the artist has created in the last few months. Buck is too modest when he lays credit for the beautiful show substantially at the feet of gallery director Jim Robischon, who supervised the intelligent installation. But it is a point well taken. The gallery has never looked better.
Buck, who is perhaps as well-known in New York or Los Angeles as he is in his hometown of Bozeman, Montana, is also familiar to many here in Denver. This is the third time in the last decade that Robischon has focused on Buck, and his expertly carved wooden sculptures and prints have also been seen at the Arvada Center and the Denver Art Museum (where his work is included in the permanent collection). The current Robischon show includes magnificent recent sculptures and sculptural reliefs, as well as one exquisite wood-block print.
Buck's sculptures always reflect an idiosyncratic iconography. Typically, a headless torso carries on its shoulders an airy assemblage of symbols, the meanings of which are often obscure. It appears that these assemblages correspond with human thought and are thus a physical expression of ideas. Often, though not always, the work has a political aspect to it; Buck has in the past addressed a wide variety of issues, including racism and environmental destruction.
The standout among the sculptures in this show is "Nagasaki," made of Jelutong wood painted with acrylics. As the title implies, "Nagasaki" also carries a political message, this one concerning nuclear disarmament. Painted almost entirely black with only a couple of red details and standing thirteen feet high (those fifteen-foot ceilings at Robischon sure come in handy), the piece is decidedly monumental. And its sheer size seems to be enhanced by the simplicity of its formal elements.
In what would be the left hand of Buck's characteristic headless torso is a red painted shape that looks like a flame (a match?). On the opposite side, literally balancing the figure, is a construction that may be a conventionalized potted plant but which also evokes the world of science. The top strikes a balance, too, with a twig acting as the leveling arm of a scale. Below the twig is a carving that looks like an article of clothing hanging on a line--or a collapsing building. Mounted above is an enclosed continuous loop with only four elements, evocative of the graphic depiction of atomic energy, and a carved disc, painted red, that suggests the flag of the Japanese empire and surely is meant to stand for the fireball of the atomic explosion.
If Buck's elements are simple, though, his stylistic influences are surprisingly complex. As with the other sculptures in the show, "Nagasaki" freely mixes a wide range of sources. Most obvious is the influence of tribal and folk art, seen in the clearly articulated chisel marks Buck leaves in the carved wood, which are visible in spite of the painted finish (and are even seen on the single bronze in the show, "Holualoa Series, #1"). That rough-hewn approach was also a characteristic of early twentieth-century modernism, which makes sense considering the significant impact African and Oceanic art had on the most experimental artists of the time. The elongated figure and the conception of the sculpture as a vignette, meanwhile, are both akin to the work of modern-art pioneer Alberto Giacometti. And the zigzags in the wood suggest the influence of another early modern master, Constantin Brancusi. By combining primitive and modern currents into a single vision, Buck achieves a uniquely personal kind of postmodernism.
Only one of Buck's wood-block prints, "The Sound of the Sea," is formally included in the Robischon show. However, all of the artist's prints are available for the asking at the gallery. Like his sculptures, Buck's prints are partly about the nature of the materials--just how wood is carvable. But whereas the sculptures employ obtuse and abstract visual components, the prints more often encompass readily recognizable subjects.
In "The Sound of the Sea," it's a conch shell that seems to bob in the water. A delicate pattern is discernible in the sea and sky of the background: a skeleton using the shell as a horn, in the manner of the ancient Polynesians. It's impossible to look at this print and not think of a 1930s beach towel. And Buck himself has made the connection to textiles--he's currently having some of the prints translated into hand-woven silk rugs in Hong Kong.
Interestingly, it's the wood-block process by which the prints are made that provides the conceptual link between Buck's sculptures and his exciting new sculptural wall panels. Those panels are essentially bas-reliefs, and it must have been a partly inked wood-block that suggested this form to Buck. Even the penciled-in details are not unlike the preliminary step in preparing a block for carving.
The first of the bas-reliefs is "Body Clock," made of joined and planed cottonwood boards adorned with carvings, pencil drawings and geometric color fields in acrylic paint. A sense of passing time is conveyed in a number of ways. On the left side of the three-part panel (which Buck chooses not to handle as a triptych) is a carved, wooden-line drawing of an hourglass, rendered in high relief and completely free from the chiseled background. On the opposite panel, which has been notched to accommodate a blue painted square, the natural appearance of the wood provides a perfect ground for graphite versions of more headless torsos. Those torsos, twelve of them, have been arranged in an oval around a low-relief carving of a twig, suggesting a clock.
The color fields on "Body Clock" and a few of the other wall panels are reminiscent of minimalist painting. But Buck's later reliefs move away from that influence and toward a hybrid of drawing and sculpture. Elaborate graphite drawings are the dominant outstanding feature of "The Shape of Content," and Buck even creates a rough illustration by gouging the painted area to reveal the color of the wood underneath. Dominating the wall panel are several sets of carved wooden eyes, all in their own shadow boxes, that evoke reliquaries.
In other wall panels such as "Ohia" and "Ulu," those shadow boxes become fully blown niches decorated with carved objects. In both of these similar pieces, a drawing evocative of European surrealism has been carved out and detailed with graphite. In "Ohia," it's a black bird in a cage in the shape of a bust; in "Ulu," the same bird is restrained in a torso-shaped cage. The object-filled niches and the caged birds are set off by a conventionalized, painted flora element that resembles a detail from an antique coverlet or quilt.
There's no way to oversell the strengths of this latest Buck exhibit. Even those who might not care for his narrative approach will be unable to deny the power of his meticulous craftsmanship and thoroughly developed conceptual scheme. As a result, the show, the first of several small blockbusters scheduled around town this fall, is a must-see for anyone interested in contemporary art.

Sponsor ContentHonda has issued a press release stating that it will recall 310,773 Pilot vehicles from the 2009 through 2011 model years in the U.S. "to inspect and potentially replace the driver’s and/or front passenger’s seat belt."
Apparently, the recall is due to what Honda is calline a "manufacturing error" on a number of the front seat belts. The term "error" is a euphemism for "defect." The defect is in bad or missing stitching which connects the lap portion of the belt to the anchor webbing, thus increasing the risk of serious injury.
The firm urges all affected Honda owners to have a specific inspection conducted by an authorized dealer. Honda states that the inspection - "and any necessary seat belt replacement" - will be free.

SIMFEROPOL, Ukraine >> Ignoring pressure and objections from the West and from Ukraine’s fledgling national government, the pro-Russian authorities in Crimea pressed ahead Thursday with plans to break away from Ukraine and become part of Russia instead.
The developments came as leaders of the European Union held emergency talks in Brussels to reinforce support for the national government in Kiev, and to look for ways to press President Vladimir” Yanukovych, two of his sons and his associates on EU soil “shall be frozen.” Yanukovych fled to Russia as his foes moved to depose him in Ukraine.
Among the targets of the measures are former ministers of the interior and justice, the former prosecutor general, the former head of the security services, and former Prime Minister Mykola Azarov and his son.
The pro-Moscow authorities in Crimea, and the Kremlin itself, seemed to be undeterred, moving to tighten their grip on the Crimean Peninsula, where Ukrainian military installations are under a tight blockade by Russian forces.
The Crimean parliament said Thursday that a referendum would be held on March 16, two weeks earlier than initially planned, offering citizens of the region a choice of remaining part of Ukraine or joining the Russian Federation. The referendum - rejected by Ukraine - had originally been scheduled for March 30.
Crimean lawmakers also said they had approved a resolution seeking membership in the Russian Federation.
Officials said the resolution was a required legal precursor to calling a referendum. The impact of the move and the consequences of its timing, however, appeared unclear. European and Ukrainian authorities rejected the latest moves as violating the Ukrainian Constitution and representing the views only of pro-Russian lawmakers in Crimea.
“My position is that this referendum is unconstitutional,” the Ukrainian economy minister, Pavlo Sheremeta, told reporters in Kiev. And a senior European official said Ukraine’s Constitution required any change of territorial sovereignty to be put to a vote of all Ukrainians, not just those in one region.
In Moscow, Dmitri S. Peskov, a spokesman for Putin, was quoted by Russian news agencies as saying that the Kremlin had been informed of the developments in Crimea but had no further comment. Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said Russia would simplify the procedures for people who have lived in Russia or the former Soviet Union to secure Russian citizenship.
The quick-moving developments came a day after the United States tried and failed to arrange the first diplomatic meeting in Paris between representatives of the Kremlin and the new leadership in Ukraine. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and his Russian counterpart, Sergey V. Lavrov, said Wednesday that more discussions would be held in the days ahead.
Early Thursday, however, Lavrov said Western moves to involve international bodies such as the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the NATO-Russia Council were counterproductive.
 organizations - action that does not help create an atmosphere for dialogue and constructive cooperation,” Lavrov said in a statement issued by the Russian Foreign Ministry on Thursday.
The statement added that the “threats and ultimatums” made it difficult to reach “honest arrangements” that would help stabilize the situation in Ukraine, apparently referring to blistering statements by Kerry and other officials.
European leaders converged on Brussels for a meeting Thursday that was also to be attended by Ukraine’s interim prime minister, Arseniy P. Yatsenyuk. The meeting followed promises of some $15 billion in financial and economic support from the European Union for the new government in Ukraine.With the holidays just around the corner entertaining for many of us is a must. How do we make our guests feel the most welcome? I stumbled upon an article written a few years ago about this very topic. I know for myself entertaining is enjoyable and nerve racking all at the same time but with these tips at least one part of it will be less stressful!
A number of things are a must for a guest bedroom, check out the list below for help making your home unforgettable this holiday season!
1) The Bed is one of the most important aspects of a guest bedroom. Make sure the Bed is in good condition but even more important make sure you have a comfortable quilt and plenty of pillows of different softness! Make sure you air out the bedding before your quests arrive. You may also want to place a dryer sheet under the bottom sheet to preserve freshness and clean smell!
2) The Guest Bathroom is the next most important room whether it is attached to the bedroom or down the hall. It is important to stock the bathroom with the necessities, I think we have all been in the situation where we have forgotten a bare necessity. Save your guests the hassle of finding the nearest Target and have your bathroom stocked!
These two tips are the most commonly used but if you want to go a step further consider the following!
1) Provide fresh flowers or aromatherapy candles.
2) Pitcher of ice water and glasses
3) A local map, area guide and disposable camera.
4) Pictures of the area and your family!
5) Mints or Chocolates on the pillows if you really want go all out!!!
I hope this holiday season is blessed and wonderful for all!
If you have additional comments or tips do not be afraid to offer a comment to this post, I am sure we will all appreciate some more wonderful ideas!

The group was prompted to write the letter, which is for publication, after editor-in-chief Alan Rusbridger came out in favour of appointing Lord Grade, the former Channel 4 chief executive and BBC chairman, as a mediator to broker a deal between politicians, Hacked Off and newspaper groups on the future of press regulation.
They instantly rejected the proposal after it was suggested by the Financial Times editor, Lionel Barber, during a parliamentary select committee hearing on Tuesday, arguing that a deal had already been struck between the three main political parties and the newspaper industry's unhappiness with this did not warrant ground for re-opening talks.
"It is baffling and disappointing to us, as people who have suffered some of the worst press abuses of recent years, that the Guardian suddenly appears ready to surrender to the manipulations of press corporations responsible for many of those abuses," said the letter.
It has been signed by 10 victims of press intrusion, including the Bristol landlord Christopher Jefferies, who won a libel payout after he was wrongly associated with a murder; Mike Hollingsworth, the ex-husband of TV presenter Anne Diamond; Sky Andrew, the football agent; and Jacqui Hames, a former police officer who presented Crimewatch.
Hacked Off said it had helped achieve a "hard-won opportunity" in the draft royal charter for press regulation that was agreed on 18 March in a late night meeting in Ed Miliband's office. It said this was approved by every single party in parliament "and backed overwhelmingly by public opinion and by victims of abuses such as ourselves".
It added: "Yet the Guardian now calls for further compromises … you urge more negotiation with proprietors and editors who have learned nothing and shown no contrition."
Earlier this year, Rusbridger called on the government to allow the press industry trial a new regulator for a year before imposing a royal charter-backed system that would include financial penalties that the press industry has argued could force the closure local newspapers and magazines.
The Guardian, the Financial Times and the country's four largest newspaper groups – Trinity Mirror, News International, Telegraph Media Group and Associated Newspapers – have objected to government proposals to impose exemplary damages on newspapers who did not sign up with the regulator.
They said they were not involved in final negotiations for the deal agreed on 18 March, unlike Hacked Off.
The newspaper publishers also have concerns about an arbitration unit which it fears will open the floodgates to claims for financial compensation from "claims farming" lawyers who will trawl the papers and magazines for potential libels.

Perhaps not surprisingly, Richardson argues that this additional spending went to needed infrastructure and education improvements, and that he maintained a prudent surplus to prevent future liabilities. Defending his spending levels, Richardson says, "My budget plan reflects my vision for the state: Investing in priorities like quality teachers in the classroom, access to health care, and putting money in the pockets of working families. At the same time, I am proposing a fiscally responsible budget, leaving more than $560 million, or 10 percent of recurring appropriations, in reserve." Americans for Tax Reform president Grover Norquist jokes that Richardson at least deserves "credit" for recognizing what few Democrats do: "Reduce the rates and then spend the money that comes in!"
Has Richardson abandoned his pro-growth and low-tax philosophy in lieu of traditional liberal tax-and-spend policies? His supporters say no and point to a 2007 agenda that includes a new working family tax credit, an acceleration of the income tax rate reductions, and a laundry list of new "targeted" tax cuts such as elimination of state income tax for active duty military personnel, tax cuts for investment management firms, tax credits for high tech investment and energy efficient offices and buildings, a one-month tax holiday for purchase of energy efficient appliances, and an "advanced coal incentive." Norquist complains that many of these tax cuts "are so directed as to become indistinguishable from subsidies and direct expenditures." To which Richardson responds that these tax cuts, like those in the past, have widespread economic benefit: "In New Mexico, we've used targeted tax cuts to create incentives for businesses to put people to work, to help middle class families, and cut the tax on food, among others."
Richardson seems to have something for everyone: tax cuts for conservatives and substantial spending for liberals. "The policies and initiatives that have worked here in my state can work across the nation," he says. "I have made economic development one of the cornerstones of my administration, and we have created close to 84,000 new jobs, balanced our budget, and we have the largest surplus in our state's history--$500 million."
Not everyone is impressed, however. Pete du Pont, former Republican governor of Delaware, acknowledges that Richardson is "on the right economic growth track." But du Pont adds that "the other essential ingredient to economic prosperity is to restrain the growth of government spending." Of course, for Democrats (and many Republicans), that may be asking too much.

Secrets in the Solar System?
Andrew Johnson -- Meticulous evidence-based researcher who invites you to: gives a presentation to New Horizons Saint Annes.
Since the late 1970's, NASA's space probes have reached all planets in the Solar System - and Pluto is no longer classed as a planet.
Mainstream Astronomy has a view of the Solar System which considers it to be "dead" and "never alive".
Since the late 1990's, our access to Image Data from Space Missions has grown considerably. Exploring some of this image data reveals a fair number of things which NASA and ESA seem reluctant to talk about. Some people say there is life on Mars - some of them are scientists who have worked for NASA.
This presentation looks at some of the NASA photos and data which suggest there may be life on Mars. In most cases, NASA will not discuss what is shown on some of these photos - discussion and analysis is left to independent researchers. Why would it be left to Ron Bennett to spot small "bug like objects" moving in the soil on Mars? Why do the BBC lie about the way the colour of the Martian sky has been determined? Why is the evidence of liquid water muddled up and covered up? Is there anything to the idea about the Ringmakers of Saturn?
In this presentation, Andrew explores some of the compelling evidence and tries to uncover some of the secrets in the Solar System.

Fri Dec 27, 2013 3:42 amCathy McMorris Rodgers' statement on the House's vote on H.R. 8, the Job Protection and Recession Prevention Act of 2012, extending the Bush tax cuts for another year.
“At a time when America is suffering through the worst economy since the Great Depression, I couldn’t think of a worse idea than raising taxes on any American,” said Rep. McMorris Rodgers. “President Obama’s plan to raise taxes is a job killer, and House Republicans are determined to stop it. The bill we passed today will extend the current tax rates for all Americans, providing much-needed tax certainty. By removing the threat of ‘taxmageddon,’ our bill will bolster America’s economy and create jobs.”
Because the tax cuts, which have been in effect for over a decade, have done nothing to create jobs. But they have increased the burden of providing government revenue on the poor and increased the burden of maintaining wealth on the wealthy. So...yeah...that, um...evens out.
Because everybody hates taxes and if you keep reminding them then they won't think about the consequences of having low taxes. See above paragraph.
Because, for Cathy McMorris Rodgers and her party, uncertainty should only apply to whether or not the government can even run--except for the parts that bomb and shoot people.

Enjoy your "election"!
It's an election year, but I don't know anyone who plans to vote. The only yard signs are on the lawns of mansions, and even those are for local races. No one talks about politics, and certainly not in a partisan manner. Neither party has offered any policy to discuss. Government agencies put up signs admonishing people to vote, rather than remaining neutral on citizens right to vote or not. The elites are basically asking "Do you approve of the job we're doing?" and then rigging the outcome so the only answer is "yes."
This isn't an election, it's a plebiscite. Most people would choose to say no.
Isn't this the third time Obama and the Democrats have vowed to end the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy? Why should we believe them now? Heck, why didn't they stand up to the wealthy and Wall Street in 2008-2010?
If a Republican House means a Libor investigation that includes an inquiry into Geithner, that's about all we can expect for the next four years. Obama won't condescend to provide any better policy rationale.
Seriously. Apathy will drown the US. If the only motivated voters are voting for Ms. McMorris Rodgers and her party, then the morass we're in will pull us down further. Are they really willing to bring the country to a complete standstill and potential ruin just to get their way? Sort of like the child who refuses to share a ball with others, only realising that they've ruined recess for everyone when the bell rings? It is going to be a very loud bell.
Both parties agree on anti-labor trade deals, and so we hear absolutely nothing during this campaign about the deals Clinton and Obama signed with Republican congresses, nor even about the pending Trans-Pacific Partnership, other than that it exists and is being negotiated in utter secrecy. The unelected elites in charge of this agreement won't even allow the full Congress to know about the relevant details. The TPP will pass no matter which bogus party the "voters" select.
Voters don't matter anymore. Only corporate "stakeholders" matter. This new category of the ultra-powerful trumps erstwhile "citizens."
On a day of dismal employment figures caused by the bigoted trade deals of the past and Clinton's bank deregulation, shouldn't the media be demanding a robust debate from the candidates on TPP?
Nah. The media are stakeholders themselves.
Obama's rhetoric does seem aimed to make the Prius-plus-SUV set feel good about themselves. I love reading Robert Herold's wine-and-cheesers in the Inlander. It's like that guy just retypes DNC missives with one hand and pats himself on the back with the other.
At least Nethercutt can pull a surprise. He like bikes! (In Europe)
Does either party have a plan to cut greenhouse gasses? No. Before you say "Solyndra, bitch!" admit that simply adding renewable capacity will not do the trick (see demand comma inelastic).
Does either party have a plan for fair trade? No.
Meaningful banking or Wall Street reform?No.
Significant differences on war powers, surveillance, torture prosecutions, Gitmo? No, course not.
Apathetic people vote. People who care won't.
What I miss are those Bush-era NOT IN MY NAME bumper stickers.
Does that mean the drone killings and assassination of American citizens etc. are the moral responsibility of liberal Democrats now? Will they attach bumper stickers admitting IN MY NAME?
No, because Obama is their great moral cleansing agent.
So what if they gave a primary and nobody came? I think (non)voters just lifted a middle finger to both parties across the state.
"Coke or Pepsi?"
Just water, thanks.
"Venti frappuccino or triple mochaccino?"
Coffee, black, please. Small.
"Whopper or Big Mac?"
Neither, really no thank you.
"Taco Bell or Taco Time?"
Y'know, I think I'll just stay home and make a sandwich from the garden.

OMG!!! Lena and her team was wonderful!! I am from DC. I had a very big destination wedding in Orlando. I needed this team at 2 locations. I was provided a very detailed schedule. I loved that. I honestly thought things might not be exactly on schedule and that was ok. BUT oh no....this team showed up at 15 mins ahead of time. They came in and set up within 10 minutes and began the makeup of 12 ladies RIGHT ON TIME. The made our time before the wedding so much fun. I loved how they were very patient and adjusted when the ladies told them what they liked or did not like. They had great attitudes, very professional and fun! We all felt like movie stars!! Me (the bride) felt like the QUEEN!! When I look at my wedding pics now. I can't believe how beautiful my face was. Use this team. You will NOT regret it. The cost was worth EVERY dime!!
It was the most professional and awesome experience ever. Lena G made me feel like a queen; she brought her staff and we didn't have to worry about anything. They made us laugh and feel so comfortable. We did spa services with her before and it was such a treat, she even brought us lunch...I LOVE HER...I recommend her to anyone.
Lena was wonderful she made me look a million dollars. I loved how I looked.
She gave me a natural but bridal beautiful look. I could not have been happier, with choosing Lena to do my bridal hair and make up, she came highly recommended by a friend of mine. And I was so happy I went with her.
My entire bridal party was so happy on how they looked. Truely is a talented stylist!!!
Maire of Orlando, FL.
Lena was amazing to work with for my wedding! Being someone who rarely wears make-up, I was a little apprehensive at first. I wanted to look natural and at the same time try something a little fierce. Lena was patience and tried several looks/techniques to find a color palette I was satisfied with. I also wanted my eyes to "pop" so I tried lash extensions. Lena applied a lash set on my wedding day and it truly made the difference in my photos! The make-up was so soft and romantic yet modern and edgy at the same time. I felt comfortable in my skin and could not feel a thing on my face. More importantly, the make-up lasted all day and night! It was make-up perfection!
Lena G and Absolutely Gorgeous Brides were great to work with. I had a consultation with Lena where I went over what I wanted for my wedding and I got to review her work. I was very impressed and knew I wanted to hire her. It was clear that she knew her stuff. About 6 weeks before the wedding I had a hair and makeup trial with Lena which went great. She did exactly what I asked for. My bridesmaids and mom also wanted to have their hair and makeup done. On the day of the wedding Lena unfortunately had a family emergency and had to send someone else to do my hair and makeup. I was assured that this person would do as good of a job and that she had pictures and info from my trial and would be able to give me exactly what had been done at the trial. I was nervous at first because it put us behind schedule initially the day of the wedding and I wasn’t sure what to expect but I was extremely happy with how everything came out. I wanted something different for my makeup than it was at the trial but I wasn’t sure exactly what I wanted. I gave her some ideas and she ran with it and I decided to just trust her. I could not have been more pleased with what she did. They were also able to get us out on time for the wedding. I felt more beautiful than I had ever felt and everyone loved my hair and makeup. My bridesmaids and Mom were also very happy with their hair and makeup. I would definitely recommend Lena and her team to other brides.
Lena was very hard to get a hold of. My wife ordered extensions for her hair 3months before the wedding. Lena didn't get them in until one week before the wedding. We had to blast her email box and send her multiple texts before getting back to us. On the wedding day, my wife looked beautiful. Lena did a wonderful job. We just wish she didn't put us through so much stress worrying about if she would flake on us. So glad she didn't.
I am very sorry that you had stress through your overall experience. I did express to your wife that I was in a very bad car accident and was under doctor supervision and medication for over two months. I absolutely apologize for any stress my misfortune caused you. Thank you for your feedback.Heel measures approximately 65mm/ 2.5 inches.

About 57 percent of voters in Fremont supported the proposal, according to unofficial results. The measure is likely to face a measure collected enough signatures to get it on the ballot.THE HAGUE (JTA) — The mayor of Brussels has agreed to change the text of an invitation to a Holocaust memorial event after Jewish groups said it contained historical falsehoods.
The office of Mayor Freddy Thielemans last week sent out an invitation to a “ceremony of official recognition of the participation of local authorities appointed by the occupying power during World War II, in the deportation of citizens of Brussels.”
Nicolas Dassonville, Thielemans’ spokesman, told JTA that the text would be changed to “name the deportees as Jewish.”
The event, planned for Sept. 2, will be the first official recognition by a Brussels mayor of the municipality’s complicity in deporting thousands of Jews from Brussels 70 years ago. The city is co-organizing the event with CCOJB, the umbrella group representing Belgium’s French-speaking Jews.
The correction comes after complaints by the Association for the Memory of the Shoah, which noted in a written statement that the deportees were not “Brussels citizens” but Jews from all over Belgium. Dr. Eric Picard, a spokesman for the association, called the text “revisionist,” according to the Belgian news agency Belga.
German occupation during World War II “never appointed the Brussels authorities,” Picard said. “The Germans merely kept the elected authorities in place.”
Joel Rubinfeld, co-chairman of the European Jewish Parliament, a new organization based in Brussels, said the text was “rewriting history.”
“The mayor would have us commemorate people from Brussels deported because of the Nazis. In fact, they were Jews deported by Brussels authorities collaborating with the Nazis,” said Rubinfeld, a former CCJOB chairman.
In a written statement, CCOJB rejected the characterization of the text as “revisionist,” adding that “In fact, it was the mayor who initiated the ceremony to recognize the responsibility of the local authorities for carrying out anti-Jewish orders imposed by the occupier, thereby contributing to their deportation to Auschwitz.”lt. Col. Charles Wayne Geary
Wednesday , October 02, 2013 - 4:53 PM
Lieutenant Colonel Charles Wayne Geary passed away peacefully in his home on September 30, 2013. Born in Morgan, Utah on March 13, 1922, to Calvin C. Geary and Hazel Wadsworth, he grew up in Morgan. He graduated from Morgan High School in 1940.
Wayne was accepted into the Army Air Corps Aviation Cadet Program, and graduated in 1944 with the rank of Second Lieutenant. During World War II he flew 35 bombing missions over Germany. Wayne was a decorated veteran of three conflicts: World War II, Korea and Vietnam. He served his country with valor and distinction, but was always modest about his accomplishments. His military career continued until his retirement in 1968.
In 1944, Wayne married Virginia Nicolaides of Ogden, Utah and enjoyed a very happy marriage while raising their three children, until Virginia's untimely death in 1985. In 1987 he married Colleen B. Follet and their marriage was solemnized in the Ogden LDS Temple in 1993. He and Colleen enjoyed many happy years together until her death in 2011.
Wayne was a man of boundless energy and curiosity. After retirement he received a degree in geology, one of his many interests, (while in the Air Force, he also earned an engineering degree). He enjoyed reading, especially about history, science and archaeology. For years he was an avid snowmobiler. Close to his heart was the Red Castle Lakes area of the High Uintas, and he made many backpacking trips there with his sons.
The Geary house was well known for its elaborate model railroad displays, especially his wonderful Christmas Village. Wayne is survived by his children Wayne Lyndell Geary (Louise) of Salt Lake City, Scott Geary of Santa Fe, New Mexico and Kristine (Mark) Roschke of El Guique, New Mexico; and stepchildren Scott (Middy) Follett, Dan (Judy) Follett, Ann (Joel) Fawcett, and Linda (Kelly) Bingham. He also leaves behind 27 grandchildren and 51 great-grandchildren.
A visitation will be held on Saturday October 5, 2013 from 1:30 to 2:45 pm at Walker Mortuary, 45 W. 200 N. in Morgan, Utah. A Graveside Service will take place at South Morgan Cemetery at 3 pm.

Please tell us where you read or heard it (including the quote, if possible).Yesterday Scott and I walked in church and glanced at the bulletin we were handed as we came in the door. Missionaries were speaking instead of our pastor preaching. And I'm ashamed to admit my first thought was "oh so sad Bro Phillip isn't preaching today". I don't know why I thought that. I think Missionaries are the MOST amazing people on this earth.
Well - this missionary and his wife serve in East Asia and he captivated me. From the minute he started to speak until long after he finished on through the final prayer - I sat and cried. I was SO convicted by what he shared. He told about the MILLIONS of people who live in East Asia where less than a 1/4 of one percent are Christian. He kept saying "How will they know if we do not tell them". He told of missionaries who were put in jail, beat, killed, their families were beat all because they were sharing about Christ and yet those same missionaries prayed for the people who beat them - and some of those people came to know Christ.
And I started thinking about how I have this blog that tens of thousands of people read daily. No one reads because of me but because God has given me this platform. And I use it just to record my daily life and to share my faith as often as I can. I thought about how I know for a fact that many of you come from different religions than me. Many of you have no relationship with God and have never stepped foot in a church. I thought about how I worry all the time about offending someone who reads this blog or about what kind of mean comments I might get if I truly shared the gospel. I thought about how scared I am sometimes to share about the single most important thing in my life - JESUS! And how people all over the world were losing their lives to share about the same thing and I was worried about COMMENTS? I thought about all the people in the world dying and not going to heaven because no one was brave enough to tell them about the greatest gift they could ever receive. And I just kept crying.
I was crying because I know of something that gives so much hope, so much love, so much joy in this dark, cold world and even if not one person reads this and changes their mind or opens their hearts - I feel like I HAVE TO SHARE about the source of all that hope and love. I thought about how so many of you are hurting and are just in search of something...............Something that no material possession can fill, no relationship can fill, no level of success can fill.
John 14:6 "Jesus says "I am the way, the truth and the life - no one comes to the Father but through me".
Romans 10:9,10 "That if you confess with your mouth, "Jesus is Lord," and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved."
All you have to do to be saved and spend eternity in heaven - is to confess that you know you are a sinner and accept Christ as your saviour! Believe in Him and begin a relationship with Him. As a Christian - you are a new creation. You will have joy that can not be explained. A peace that passes all understanding.
You can not work your way into heaven. The Bible says even our BEST works are like filthy rags in God's eyes. Thankfully - Ephesians 2:8-9 says "For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God— not by works, so that no one can boast." That's the best news ever - it's God's AMAZING grace that saves us. It's NOTHING we can do. Isn't that freeing?
I just want you to know the love that God has for you. I want you to know how great a life in Christ can be! I accepted Christ at a young age and I have never doubted my salvation. There have been many days and years where I was not as close to God. But He never left me. The only way I can know Him and hear Him and grow closer is to spend time talking to Him in prayer and reading the Bible.
How do I know that all this is real? Because I have felt God in my life. I have seen Him at work. I can't explain the hope that I have in Him. I could not have made it through many things I have been through without trusting that His word is true. I believe the Bible is the inherent word of God. Every word is true. It's all about faith. Faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see (Hebrews 11:1). Without faith - it is impossible to please God. (Hebrews 11:6)
I didn't write this before because I just wanted to write down how to KNOW Christ - but yes - once you are saved - it is not really enough to just believe in Him. Even Satan believes in Jesus. You must serve Him and strive to have a relationship. We don't do "works" to earn our way into heaven but we DO serve and try to follow Him in all we do because we love Him and want to Honor the One who saved us. James 2:20 says "Faith without works is dead".
I share all of this because I deeply care about each of you who comes here to check in on my life. I felt very strongly that I needed to share this with you today and God just laid it on my heart in a very clear way that I HAD to share it.Thanks for your patience in waiting on this update Publix list.

The branches would then transform into leaves and/or photo holders, and would be set at different heights over the wood so it would look more three dimensional.
Step 1: Materials, tools and preparation
The stuff I used is very basic and extremely cheap: wood slats recovered from an old pallet, and copper wire.
For the pallet, I am lucky enough to work in an industrial sector of our city, so every now and then some companies leave old and broken pallets out for the garbage company to pick up. I just got to one of those pallets first, and that was it. You can also get a whole bunch of them for free off of site like kijiji, so take a look if you don't have easy access to them.
As far as disassembling the pallet goes, it's quite simple and there are tons of videos on the net about doing this (so I won't go into too many details about it). You basically need to separate the planks as carefully as possible to avoid braking them (especially if they are old and gnarly, which would offer a look you'd probably want to keep). Once separated, use a stiff hand brush with soap and warm water to thoroughly wash the boards and then set them to dry.
Copper - I stopped by the local hardware store to buy it, and basically picked up about four meters of coiled copper wire that did not have the plastic shielding around it (about $3 a meter). It's composed of about seven relatively stiff copper wires which is excellent for this project. One end of the cable remained coiled (representing the bottom of the branch), and you just uncoil some of the wire strands as you build the higher (and thinner) branches which then also becomes leaves and photo frames.
Tools
I used a combination of power and hand tools, and aside from the regular assortment of stuff you'll find in a tool box, you'll need a scraper (or planer), an angle, circular saw, clamps, wood glue and a drill.
Design
A rough sketch of what you want the branches to look like always helps. I taped four letter sized sheets of paper together and then drew the branches and frame locations on it. This would later on serve as a guide to size the wood panel and lay down the wires.The Football Ferns will open the London Olympics with a dream match-up against host nation Great Britain.
That comes thanks to yesterday's draw for the Games, which also threw up two mouth-watering fixtures against Brazil for both the Ferns and the Oly Whites.
The Ferns will meet Great Britain at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium on July 25 two days before the opening ceremony, before squaring off against two-time silver medallist Brazil at the same venue three days later. Then they wrap up pool play against Olympic debutant Cameroon at the City of Coventry Stadium.
The Oly Whites, captained by Ryan Nelsen as one of three over-age players in a mostly under-23 squad, open their campaign against Belarus on July 26 in Coventry. They play Egypt at Old Trafford on July 29 before running out against a likely star-studded Brazilian line-up at Newcastle's St James' Park on August 1.
Both New Zealand coaches were buoyed by the combinations, with men's coach Neil Emblen stressing the importance of the team's first two fixtures.
"There's one absolute powerhouse in our group," Emblen said. "Brazil's the game that will catch the eye. But there's two other strong footballing nations in our group. However we think they are games we can look at with real hope we can go and get some points.
"We're playing Belarus and Egypt, as are Brazil, who'll be clear favourites to win the group," said Emblen. "So a win and a draw may be enough to get to the next stage where anything can happen."
Women's coach Tony Readings said his team would treat the opening game as an honour but would certainly not afford the hosts any favours.
"It's always a privilege to play in these events. To draw the hosts to open the entire Olympic Games will be very special for our team." said Readings.
"But we've got three difficult games and our mission is the same whether it's opening game or final pool game. We're out to get the points we need to secure a top-two placing in the group."

The theme of the ‘06 Umbrella promo celebrates the imagination of the Sci Fi Channel viewer. After an initial phone call with Loskywitz, Rice came up with the melodic line of an “unanswered question.”
Working on Apple’s Logic Pro 7, Rice scrolled through Sculpture, a synthesizer plug-in, to help define the soundscape of his score.
”I always find a fresh sound in Sculpture, something I haven’t imagined before. I love the way it uses textures and modulates sounds,” he says. Then Rice went to samples in the Vienna Symphonic Library, which he calls “my ghost orchestra,” to orchestrate the track. “I used tonalities that were open to interpretation to keep things sounding not suspenseful but optimistic and hopeful,” he explains.
Rice then devised the drum rhythm, using raw samples of different types of drums, to approximate the Brazilian samba school.
As the motion graphics were created and revised, Rice was required to rewrite the corresponding music. “If I wasn’t working in Logic it would have been impossible,” he says. “It was a matter of keeping up with each change and re-orchestrating the effect.”
Rice also recorded the voiceover by 15-year-old Valentina D’Angelis.Firkin Pub Coupons

“I have hidden your word in my heart that I might not sin against you. Praise be to you, Lord; teach me your decrees.” Psalms 119:11,12 NIV
Success is knowing and loving God. Psalm 119 is the longest chapter in the Bible. Its 176 verses are presented in 22 stanzas of 8 verses each, and each stanza corresponds to the successive letters of the Hebrew alphabet. Because it is an acrostic song, Spurgeon said it could be called “the alphabet of love,” for it unfolds God’s loving provision of wisdom for His children

Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect. Romans 12:2 ESV
Happy Wednesday! I am in the office early today and spending time reflecting on this text. It is not easy to stay focused on the good.
Join me in praying that God will be with us today to keep us looking to Him for direction.
“Quiet Idea” Adopt a “quiet” critter for your classroom. Give to the child who is sitting the quietest (should be a surprise and used to encourage quiet behavior).
“Give Mom a Hand”
Theme: Mother’s Day Text: Proverbs 31:28-31
Preparation: In a box or paper sack, place different kinds of gloves. You’ll also need a Bible.
The Message: (Read the Scripture.)
What does this verse tell us to do? God tells us to praise our moms and say great things about them so everyone will know how terrific they are! Today, we’ll give our moms a special hand. Gloves are good for lots of things. Let’s see how these gloves help us. (Give each child at least one glove.) Hold up your glove and tell how it reminds you of things your mom does. Our moms sure do a lot of different things! (Collect the gloves.)
Let’s pray. Dear God, thanks for our moms who work, play, clean, cook, and love us with their hands. Show us how to honor them every day. Amen.
Now, let’s use our hands to praise our moms! (Lead kids in applauding for their mothers.)
I need your help! There are 2 important events that I would like you to help me advertise and ”get the word out”. (Posters available, just email me and I will send them to youthe/young adult conference website) This event is for any couple wanting to enrich their marriage.
Your help in getting these 2 events advertised is greatly appreciated.
May is graduation month for many schools. Our children will be looking at their future and direction for what lies ahead. They need our help and God’s guidance. I will continue to pray for them and you.
Let’s focus on the return of our Savior, may it be soon.
This weekend the GO FISH Team will be at the Solid Rock SDA Church/School in Orlando.

If your church or school would like the team to come and present this program, (or if you need more information about the program) contact me.

“Finally brethren, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is of a good report — if there is any virtue and if there is any praise– — think on these things.” Philippians 4:8
Moms are a source of honor, goodness, and loveliness. As in all things pure and virtuous, we are encouraged to think upon such things.
The Mother’s Day tradition honors the one woman who nurtured, encouraged and loved her children. The Bible instructs in Exodus 20:12 to “Honor your father and mother. Then you will live a long, full life in the land the LORD your God will give you.”
It’s interesting to note that Mother’s Day is celebrated around the world. The American tradition began May 10, 1908 when Anna M. Jarvis first suggested the national observance of honoring all mothers. It was at her mother’s memorial service where she gave her mom’s favorite flower, a carnation, to every person in attendance. Then on May 9, 1914, by an act of Congress, President Woodrow Wilson proclaimed the second Sunday in May as Mother’s Day. He established the day as a time for “public expression of our love and reverence for the mothers of our country.”
As the American holiday was adopted by other countries and cultures, the date was changed to fit already existing celebrations honoring motherhood.
While Mothering Sunday is celebrated the fourth Sunday of Lent and is often referred to as “Mother’s Day” even though it is an unrelated celebration. Although it’s often called Mothers’ Day it has no connection to the American festival of that name. Traditionally, it was a day when children, mainly daughters, who had gone to work as domestic servants were given a day off to visit their mother and family.
A common idea for Mother’s Day is to include kids in some way.
- Have kids share things they like about their Mom in a sentence
- Have the kids participate in giving flowers to their mothers after the service
- Have your Sabbath School classes work the week before Mother’s Day to create a giant Mother’s Day card and place it in the foyer for Sabbath Morning.
- Take a video camera to your Sabbath School Classes a few weeks before Mother’s day and get some candid quotes from kids about their Moms
I am looking forward to celebrating Mother’s day with my 90 year mother this year. I trust you will stop to remember the past and present mothers of your family and your church family.
This coming Sabbath the Creative ministry team will be worshiping and sharing our ministry with Cocoa SDA Church. Please keep us in your prayers and if you are in the area join us.
Last weekend I was at Andrews University in Michigan for a Children’s Leadership Conference it was a great opportunity to network and share ideas. Spring is all around the university campus and neighboring areas. I thank the Lord for travelling mercies and new friends.

Now for the rest of the story….
Yesterday and today have been spent putting the final touches on preparations for English Camp Meeting Children’s Programming etc. AS you may have noticed I sent the weekly letter with only the verse. God is good … He gave me another day to finish what I had started.
Mother’s Day Idea: Balloon Card I love this interactive card idea. You’ll need a large latex balloon (yellow or pink colors work great) a Mother’s Day card and an envelope. You will need one for each child. First, inflate the balloon and help the child write a special message on it like, “I love you Mom for all your sweet smiles.” Allow the ink to dry for one minute then deflate the balloon. Tuck the deflated balloon inside the card and send it home with a special message that says, “Please inflate me!” Mommies will love this little gift.

But in experiments, the complex, called HAMLET, hiked bacteria's sensitivity to multiple classes of antibiotics, including penicillin and erythromycin.
In fact, HAMLET (also known as Human Alpha-lactalbunim Made Lethal to Tumor Cells) caused bacteria to die in large numbers. In lab experiments HAMLET lowered the dose of antibiotics needed to fight superbugs, researchers said.
By any measure, that's huge step forward in gaining control over drug-resistant infections.
According to Laura Marks, an investigator involved the study, HAMLET is "naturally occurring."
HAMLET is not associated with the type of toxic side effects doctors see with the use of high-powered antibiotics that are needed to kill certain drug-resistant infections, she said.
In a statement , lead study author Dr. Anders Hakansson noted, "HAMLET has the potential to minimize the concentration of antibiotics we need to fight infections, and enable us to use well-established antibiotics against resistant strains again."
He added that using HAMLET makes it "possible for well-established antibiotics to finish the job."
The study appears online in PLOS ONE, a peer-reviewed, open-access journal.
Moms, of course, have known all along that breast milk has extraordinary powers when it comes to healthy babies.
Now it appears that mother's milk may save lives as well.
Recently, the university filed a provisional patent application enumerating HAMLET's antibiotic potential. Dr. Hakansson, who works along with his wife, Hazeline Hakansson, as a research partner, according to Healthline News, is planning to continue this work.
In the meantime, work closely with your own health care provider whenever you or your little ones need antibiotics. And consider these points when someone in your house gets sick:
-Don't pressure your doc for meds if they're not needed and won't make you or your kids feel better.
-Avoid using drugs prescribed for a previous illness, or worse, use drugs that were prescribed for someone else in the family.
-Teach your little ones infection prevention. A little soap and water goes a long way to achieving good health.
How do you minimize antibiotic use in your household? Tell us in the space below.Cyndi Lauper Serenades Crowd at Airport

Corporate sponsors, food and merchandise vendors, and approximately 40 nonprofit organizations lined the walkways along the Ohio River, each offering its own set of giveaways to the estimated 100,000 patrons that attend the three-day event.
“What is your giveaway?” one young lady asked a volunteer as she approached the AiG booth. “Life-changing material,” an AiG staff member replied.
And there was plenty of that to go around. Thousands of booklets, including Where Did the “Races” Come From? Is There Really a God? Why is There Death and Suffering? and material on Answers in Genesis and the Creation Museum, were given away. A special flyer that pointed people to various AiG resources and the website was also handed out. Children of AiG staff members became mini-evangelists by enthusiastically handing out material to young and old, while also suggesting that people sign up for the free newsletter. And 176 people did just that.
A child enthusiastically views the four-page poster inside every Kids Answers. An AiG staff member watches from the left.
One man who recognized the importance of the Bible-affirming material insisted that his booklets get placed in his shirt pocket instead of the bag that was stuffed with other freebies. He wanted to make sure that these booklets got read instead of just thrown away like the rest of the material, which would be bound for the trash when he got home.
Many children enjoyed receiving a free copy of Kids Answers with the poster of two dinosaurs getting ready for a fight. Numerous AiG staff members found the mini-magazine to be a great door-opener for further conversation with parents and grandparents. “I was surprised by how easily I could capture someone’s excitement while talking about AiG and the Creation Museum—even if I only had 15 seconds with them,” said Candace Nordine, Ministry Relations Coordinator who volunteered her time to equip families with biblical truths from the very first verse. Some conversations went well beyond 15 seconds, and most turned into positive discussions about origins, the authority of Scripture, refuting evolution, and the Creation Museum.
Over one thousand booklets (inside pages above), custom-made for the Black Family Reunion, were distributed.
Accounting Manager Tom Hill, recalled one conversation he had with a student at a local Christian college who had just completed a course in comparative religion. As part of the course, they had examined origin legends, “including” young-earth creationism. She had many upcoming research projects and papers to write and wanted to approach the topic from a young-earth creationist point of view but was having trouble finding research materials to support her view. Needless to say, Tom was able to point her to the AiG website with its thousands of online articles and the numerous resources in the Answers Bookstore.
But this evangelistic opportunity in AiG’s own backyard wasn’t just about refuting evolution; it was also about defending the family as God designed it (one man and one woman).
The fact that AiG’s booth was located between organizations that have agendas that undermine the family mirrors the culture that all families face today. On one side was the Gay, Lesbian, and Straight Education Network (GLSEN), who shared a booth with Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays (PFLAG); on the other side was Planned Parenthood.
This outreach was also a chance to point people to a place where they can get real answers from the history book of the universe—a place that’s just across the river: the Creation Museum, which is set to open in spring 2007.
While most attendees graciously accepted the packets of material offered to them, the very last man who came by as the volunteers packed up the remaining resources was a bit antagonistic, using such terms as “ruthless,” “cruel” and “hateful” to describe God. Tom Hill tried to engage him in rational conversation. But “Bob” (the name he gave) said he had taken a number of religion classes and that our God was the worst of them all. However, before he walked away, one of the volunteers was able to convince him to take a card with the AiG web address listed after she suggested that he at least read over some of the many scientific articles on the website. As Tom was reminded, “We labor not only for the believers who rejoice in our Lord but also for the Bobs of the world.”
Representatives also promoted the Creation Museum, only a few miles from downtown Cincinnati and sure to be a popular attraction after its spring 2007 opening.
Participating in the Black Family Reunion was just one example of how AiG continues to reach across ethnic boundaries with the life-changing message of how we are all “one blood” and that there is only one race—the human race.
Sometimes the first step towards racial reconciliation is simply a matter of crossing a bridge to overcome barriers—whether they are physical or mental. Once Christians break through the barriers, they will see that we truly are one family. As Dr. Charles Ware, a popular speaker on racial reconciliation at AiG conferences, explains, “We have a common father named Adam, we’ve got a common problem named sin, and we’ve got a common solution—His name is Jesus Christ.”

Answers in Genesis is an apologetics ministry, dedicated to helping Christians defend their faith and proclaim the gospel of Jesus Christ.Sponsorship Chair : Dawei Song, The Robert Gordon University, UK

SIGIR 2010 General ChairsI have to say I was shocked and disappointed at the “friendly feedback” concerning the proposed strip club in Destin. I salute the town leaders who stood up for the right thing. Yes, it cost a lot, but the cost of having a local business of that sort could be much worse.
Most Destin residents care deeply for family values in this special beach town. It’s not the residents who would support such a place but people who come in, people who are attracted to atmospheres like that. Just the fact that a prospective owner of the place was murdered outside his Atlanta establishment tells us something.
Maybe we need to re-evaluate where our priorities are.
Thank God for a strong, courageous City Council for protecting our city and our families. Now let’s get some ordinances in place to prevent more chaos.

Dear Usual Commenters who insist that "gay-isms" are the result of "pressure" from the "stereotypical mainstream gay community" to "conform" to "affectations of behavior",
if that nonsense is true then why is this ex-gay, like ALL ex-gays, the utter embodiment of all of those "isms" that y'all claim are elective affectations to "fit in to the mainstream gay culture"?
here's a man who lives each day trying to distance himself from anything gay - so why do his supposedly-affected "gay-isms" remain?
yeah. exactly. ;-)

"I'm not gay" followed by extra-squish-overreative-gayface... Oh, he's SO gay.
@Alejo: Sorry you can't see the mannerisms. Suffice it to say they aren't "straight" either.
Poor guy. He and "Leslie" are missing so much in life by persisting in a lie because of their belief in another one (religion).
Posted by: Eric | Aug 22, 2012 4:14:41 PM
Gotta say I agree with Steve and Javier above.
While I am sad for Mr. Chambers and believe strongly that his life has been adversely affected by the religious dogma he was taught, it IS a big step (and an important one) for someone in his position to publicly renounce "reparative" therapy.
We live in a country where we are all (at least allegedly) free to adopt whatever religious beliefs we want, even when those beliefs appear to others to be damaging to our lives and psyches. EVERY ONE of us -- whether raised gay or straight, religious or not, urban or country, conservative or liberal -- makes choices about how much of our upbringing to retain as part of our adult lives. Mr. Chambers has made his choice about where the balance is for him between who he is and what his religion tells him he should be. As long as he (and Leslie, of course) understands that choice and is not trying to force it on others, everyone else needs to respect it, even when we think it is wrongheaded. There is no reason that he needs to say he's "gay" just because you think he should.
I would also remind all you disbelievers that we are only a few decades removed from a time when MANY of us would have had wives and children, notwithstanding our homosexuality. Many of those mismatched relationships of the past were full of love, even though they might have been sexually unfulfilling. As you will all learn, I hope, a loving relationship has far more to do with a meeting of minds and souls than it does a meeting of genitalia (not that good sex isn't a good part of it too.) I have little doubt that Mr. Chambers loves Leslie, notwithstanding the fact that she doesn't have a penis.

Not true, BUSTER. For the Alan Chambers of the U.S. do force their views onto the public and won't rest until you agree with them- it's called evangelism. They ultimately want to make it law-a theocrasy.

from Chip Alexander of the News & Observer,.
“We lost Faulk. We lost Pitkanen. If a team loses arguably one of the best goalies in the league and then two of its best defensemen, I don’t know of any team that could sustain that and win.”
Despite the string of losses, Karmanos said he found no fault in the efforts of Canes coach Kirk Muller and his staff or the players.
“We still played really, really tough hockey,” he said. “Even when the other teams got breaks, we played hard and were competitive. Our defense was weakened with those three players out.
“Some pretty good teams didn’t make the playoffs. The line between winning and losing in our league is a thin line, the league is so well-balanced.”

Qure Model 9738
SPL QURE The Qure is a 2-channel, parametric, 3-band EQ, ideally suited for demanding tonal shaping of individual instruments,voices and complex musical signals. Mastering applications benet from the unique tonal potential and the sophisticated ltering design that perfectly complements the ne details of the sound being processed. The highly sophisticated circuitry of the Qure forms the basis for its outstanding tonal qualities: each lter is serially connected on separate boards with individual op-amps, resulting in excellent noise and distortion values, with a hard bypass available for each individual lter. Another feature is the proportional-Q function of the lters. In contrast to traditional constant-Q designs, proportional-Q technology provides clear advantages in tonal shaping: processing of a wide frequency spectrum can be achieved with greater sensitivity than on a narrow frequency section a hearing-correct and musical response that permits subtle control. This also eliminates the need for later adjustment of the Boost/Cut settings. The output signal from the lters passes through a tube stage (ECC 83 tubes), which is in large part responsible for the pleasantly warm tonal characteristic of the unit thanks to a sophisticated power supply precisely matched to the tube characteristics. The newly developed QURE circuit can be activated in the tube stage: this coil/lter network responds dynamically to the behavior of the lters and lls out the harmonic structures of the signal.With the QURE controller you can create a fresh, brilliant and silky tonal atmosphere in the Mid- to Hi-range. Processed instruments and voices are located in the mix in front of all other signals without having to create space for them.

Ronald Prent, Galaxy Studios (B) When you turn a knob on the Qure, you dont get the feeling for example that youre changing a guitar so that it suddenly sounds like a synthesizer. If you want, you can bring out the positive aspects of a sound and eliminate undesired components without masking the character of the instrument. When youve done processing, you dont have the feeling so much that you smoothed something, but rather that you simply brought out the desirable characteristics of the sound that were already inherent in it.

Introduction
The QURE is a parametric equalizer for creative sound design
Congratulations on purchasing the QURE, one of the most advanced and musical sounding parametric equalizer currently available. The QURE is a fully parametric equalizer, specially designed to meet the most demanding studio applications. It is designed as 3band, two-channel system with input and output gain controls, high-cut and low-cut filters as well as the new QURE-circuitry for the creative and corrective sound shaping of vocals, instruments and complex stereo material. Both balanced XLR and balanced stereo jacks are provided for signal connections to and from the QURE. Its musically optimized parametric filters, based on a sophisticated refinement of state-variable-filter technology (SVF), include proportional bandwidth, tube technology for a warm and fat sounding mid-range, LC filtering for clear and transparent upper frequencies, transistor and semi-conductor technology for a volumious low end. The proportional-Q principle provides precise control over a frequency range, from 15 Hz to 21 kHz, while the low noise level of -99 dB (A-weightened), and the enormous dynamic range of 113 dB, make the QURE ideally suited for mastering and cutting. By employing circuitry designed around the principles of perceived sound, rather than simply designing by numbers, the QURE overcomes the limitations of conventional parametric equalizers.
The QURE combines a technology-mix of five decades of audio engineering
Exemplary specification contribute to the excellency of this EQ
The QURE circuitry
The QURE circuitry improves presence, clarity and depth. It can also be used to cure recordings from digital harshness. The QURE circuitry is a new SPL development which gives the name for the unit and also represents a new technology, which uses coils to increase the presence of vocals and the depth of the music. At the same time it is ideally suited to cure recordings from digital harshness. The name is derived from cure in combination with Q from EQ. The signal runs through a tube circuitry featuring a Sovtek 12 AX 7 double triode tube in a mixed current/voltage coupling mode. This stage is extremely clip-resistant and produces a pleasant and musical sounding tube-THD spectrum. A new LCR network combined with a 12AX7 tube reacts on the dynamic response of the audio and alters THD and phase response. The QURE ON switch puts a coil/condenser/resistor filternetwork (LCR) into the tube output stage. This network is integrated into the coupling path of the tube and reacts on the dynamic reponse of the input signal by influencing THD spectra and phase response. The QURE potentiometer changes the frequency response and produces a fresh and silky top-end and a mid-range free of sharpness and harshness. The presence and aura of vocals is largely improved.
Proportional Q
Unlike most other equalizers which use constant-Q filters, the QURE adopts the proportional-Q principle to realize maximum musicality. Conventional constant-Q designs keep the amplitude constant, regardless of the adjusted bandwidth (Q).The disadvantage of this is, when it comes to sound creation, frequencies above and below the center frequency are often boosted so intensely that they lose their musicality. With proportional-Q it is quite different; the amplitude of the processed frequency band is reduced as the bandwidth broadens. Adjusting the bandwidth back to a narrow bandwidth (high Q), will increase the amplitude of the center frequency to its former level. Furthermore, with proportional-Q, there is no need to constantly readjust the boost/cut control when varying the bandwidth as is usually necessary with constant-Q equalizers. It is generally perceived that equalizersizing with proportional-Q is therefore more intuitive and subjectively musical than with constant-Q equalizers. The QURE forms its response curve around the center frequency with a bell-like response, so that frequencies closer to the center frequency are emphasized slightly more; frequencies further from the center are less affected. The development of these filter curves was the result of extensive listening tests, and the result is an equalizer that combines technical excellence and precision with unsurpassed musicality. With the musical proportional-Q principle the amplitude of the processed frequency band is reduced as the bandwidth broadens.
Equalizing with proportional-Q is more intuitive and subjectively musical than with constant-Q equalizers.
The Frequency Bands
The QURE is configured as a two-channel, 3-band equalizer with a separate hard-bypass switch for each band. The filters are connected in series. The three filters bands cover a frequency range from 15 Hz to 21kHz. In addition each channel is equipped with high- and low-cut filters. Tuning the equalizer is very intuitive because the frequency control law has been designed to match the characteristics of the human hearing system.The perfectly linear phase response of the QURE circuitry, combined with its wide bandwidth, contributes to the sonic excellence of this esoteric equalizer. The mid-band features the non-reciprocal response of the BOOST/CUT control which qualifies this band to operate as a notch filter, too. Cutting is allowed to -36 dB at high Q (Q 5) whereas the low and high band offer cutting of -15 dB. The sonic advantage of the non-reciprocal response design is the vast dynamic response making the filter sound very open and clear. The mid-band features a non-reciprocal response of the BOOST/CUT control The QURE is a two-channel, 3-band equalizer with the filter bands connected in series
General Features
Stepped potentiometers for easy recall; individual bypass for each filter band To allow easy recall of all control settings the QURE is equipped with stepped potentiometers throughout. The number of steps is optimized realize a gentle frequency sweep with a musically optimized control range.

The housing of the QURE has the standard 19"-EIA format and occupies 2U (88.9 mm) in your rack. When installing the unit in a 19"-rack, the rear side of the unit needs some support, especially in a touring case. Choose the installation location of your unit carefully: The QURE should not be installed near units which produce strong magnetic fields or extreme heat. Avoid placing it in direct sunlight. Also avoid locations subject to vibration and excessive dust, heat, cold, or moisture. Keep it away from sources of hum such as transformers or motors. Do not install the QURE directly above or below power amplifiers. Check that the voltage details quoted on the back panel are the same as your local mains electricity supply. Use a minus (-) screwdriver to set the voltage selector to the voltage for the area in which the unit will be used. Never cover up the ventilation slots on the top of the unit. If, during operation, the sound is interrupted or indicators no longer illuminate, or if abnormal odor or smoke is detected, or if liquids are spilled on the unit, immediately disconnect the power cord plug and contact your dealer. WARNING: Do not open the cabinet of this unit, because to do so might result in damage to the unit, or injury by electric shock. If any foreign object or substance enters the unit, contact your dealer for assistance.To reduce the risk of electric shock, do not expose this appliance to rain or moisture. To prevent damage by lightning, disconnect the power cord from the household AC outlet during an electrical storm. When disconnecting the power cord from the household AC outlet, grasp the plug; do not pull the cord. Refer servicing to qualified personnel only! Do not apply excessive force when using switches and controls. When moving the unit, be sure to first disconnect the power cord from the household AC outlet, and disconnect cords connected to other equipment. Do not attempt to clean the unit with chemical solvent as this might damage the finish. Only clean the QURE with a clean, soft, lint-free cloth.
Operation Safety
Important security advices
Connections
THE QURE is fitted with both XLR connectors and TRS stereo jacks for balanced operation, though the jacks may be used with unbalanced connections simply by plugging in mono jack-plugs. The level difference that normally occurs when a balanced input or output is used unbalanced is automatically compensated for. Should the need arise to use the XLR connectors in an unbalanced system, pin 3 of the XLRs should be grounded. Inserting a mono jack also unbalances the XLRs.
Both output stages operate in parallel, so it is possible to connect two different destination units simultaneously, for example to record to two different media at the same time or split the output between a mixer and effects processor. However, only one type of input (jack or XLR) should be connected at a time the QURE is not intended to be used as a mixer!
To ensure optimal signal quality, SPL has developed a superbalancing hybrid input/output stage using all laser-trimmed resistors with a tolerance of 0.01%.This approach has resulted in high CCMR (common mode rejection) values better than -90 dB at 1 kHz. As a precaution, before connecting the QURE switch off the power to the unit and to all connected units.

1. Processing single instruments or vocals
To process single instruments or vocals insert the two separate QURE channels into the specific inserts of your console to process two signals independently. Note that the MASTER switch will bypass both channels together. Use the bypass switch of each filter band when processing two independent sources.
Applications
MULTI-TRACK
Insert send channel Y into Qure input 2 Insert send channel X into Qure input 1
Application 1: The QURE inserted into two individual tracks
MISCHPULT
Insert return ch. X Insert return channel Y
You can also insert the unit into the master breaks during mixdown or into the sub-groups, when specific elements of the mix are being treated selectively. When patching the QURE into the sub-groups or master-breaks of the console, note if they are switched pre or post fader. They should best be switched pre fader, so that a variation of the master fader does not affect the input level of the QURE. The effect level and the treated sound will then remain unchanged.
2. Processing final mixes
To process a final mix, either while mixing or during postproduction prior to cutting insert the QURE into the master inserts of your console or right in between a playback and a recording unit.

The special characteristics of the QURE allow you to add weight and punch to the bass end of a mix or to lift harmonic detail out of the top end of a mix, without inadvertently adding harshness or muddiness to the sound. In this respect, the QURE can produce results every bit as dramatic as those achieved using sub-bass synthesizers or harmonic generators, but without adding distortion to the original signal.
Control Elements 2
WARM UP & READY
The QURE features a special relay circuitry that slowly builds up the 275 volts over a period of 45 sec. Thereby the lifetime of the tubes is increased by up to four times. In pre-mastering this circuitry garantees a reproducable sound for a long time. The tubes in use are Sovtek 12 AX 7s. The WARM UP-LED (red) illuminates after the main power has been switched on. After 45 seconds it switches to READY (orangeLED). The in- and outputs of the tubes are de-coupled at 10 Hz with condensers of high voltage and capacity (1 microFarad/ 400 V/5 %) to minimize offset and humming noise. If the unit is already switched to active with the MASTER switch during the warm up period you will not hear any processing until the QURE switches to READY. Then the processed signal is switched to the outputs. Although you may not have done any equalization to the signal you will hear a little difference between the processed and the unprocessed signal because the tubes already produce a portion of their typical sound.
MASTER
MASTER switches the QUREs entire sound processing on or off. The illuminated switch indicates that the QURE has been activated. The MASTER function is a relay-hard-bypass function which links the input socket directly with the output socket to bypass all filters by pressing just one button. To increase operation reliability the QURE monitors the power supplys primary and secondary voltages and switches automatically to hard bypass once certain tolerances have been exceeded (power failure safety).
The QURE features an IN control that enables you to set the level at which the QURE filters operate. The level can be changed between -12 dB and +18 dB. To run the unit hotter set the level between the 0 dB-position and the clockwise position (up to +18 dB).This will result in a more intensely processed sound. Conversely, in order to achieve milder processing, set the level between the 0 dB-position and the counter clockwise position (up to -12 dB).
The IN control is followed by high (HF) and a low frequency (LF) cut filters with individual frequency controls.The HF/LF CUT ON is the hard-bypass switch for both filters. If the cut filters are not needed the HF/LF CUT ON switch routes the audio around this section to provide maximum audio quality when in bypass (LED is not illuminated). The HF CUT and LF CUT are usually used as a pair to provide control over the extremes of the audio spectrum.
HF/LF CUT ON
The HF CUT filter is a 2nd order Butterworth filter defining the upper roll-off frequency the audio is to have. Fully counter clockwise the control is set to its starting position of 20kHz. Even if the HF/LF CUT filters are activated there is hardly any audible frequency limitation to the spectrum. All frequencies below 20 kHz are passing through. Turning clockwise reduces the upper roll-off frequency until fully clockwise the minimum roll-off frequency of 2.5 kHz is reached. Diagram 3 illustrates the frequency response curves for the highest roll-off (20 kHz) and the lowest roll-off frequency (2.5 kHz).
HF CUT
The LF CUT filter is also a 2nd order Butterworth filter defining the lower roll-off frequency the audio is to have. Fully counter clockwise the control is set to its starting position of 40Hz. All frequencies above 40 Hz are passing through. Turning clockwise increases the lower roll-off frequency until fully clockwise the maximum roll-off frequency of 200 Hz is reached. Diagram 3 (page 12) illustrates the frequency response curves for the lowest roll-off (40 Hz) and the highest roll-off frequency (200 Hz).
LF CUT
Diagram 3: Frequency responses for the lowest (40Hz) and highest roll-off (200Hz). HF CUT: 20kHz to2.5kHz LF CUT: 40Hz to 200Hz
LF (Low Freq.)
Diagram 4: Frequency responses for the lowest (15Hz) and highest (365Hz) LF control setting at max. B/C and Q5
The low frequency control (LF) operates over more than four octaves. The center frequency can be varied between 15 Hz and 365 Hz.
The mid frequency control (MF) also covers more than four octaves. The center frequency can be varied between 200 Hz and 5 kHz.
MF (Mid Freq.)
Diagram 5: Frequency responses for the lowest (200Hz) and highest (5kHz) MF control value at max. B/C and Q5
The high frequency control (HF) covers more than four octaves. The center frequency can be varied between 1 kHz and 21 kHz.
HF (High Freq.)
Diagram 6: Frequency responses for the lowest (1kHz) and highest (21kHz) HF control setting at max: B/C and Q5
BW (Bandwidth) 10
The bandwidth (BW) control is identical for all three frequency bands. The BW control determines the width (or the Q) the frequency curve around the selected center frequency is to have. The parameter is measured as a quotient Q of the following formula: Q = (fofu)/ (fo-fu) fo is the upper corner frequency and fu the lower corner frequency measured at the -3 dB point of the frequency curves. Narrow bandwidth corresponds with a high Q and vice versa. The BW is set to high Q (Q 5) when turned fully counter clockwise. The influenced range covers approximately 0.2 octaves. Turning the BW control fully clockwise selects low Q values (Q 0.5) covering approximately 2.5 octaves.
Diagram 7: All 11 steps of the BW control from smallest Q (Q5) to broadest Q (Q0,5) are shown. The center frequency is1kHz. The diagram is valid for both LF and HF band.
Diagram 8: As diagram 7, but for the non-reciprocal response of the MF band.
The QURE utilizes the proportional-Q principle, also known as variable Q. The amplitude varies depending on the Q setting.
Using low-Q values, automatically readjusts the amount of boost or cut selected to keep the subjectively perceived loudness constant. With constant-Q equalizers there is often only a limited range of useable settings. Sometimes this is so narrow, you may wonder why the Q control was not permanently fixed at the point it sounded really good. Above that position it often starts to sound harsh and peaky, and below with the broad bandwidth, the sound is colored so you need to constantly re-set the boost/cut control. Not so with proportional-Q. The Q control provides useable settings over the entire range giving you more versatility to be creative. EQ adjustments with proportional-Q sound a lot more musically related and offer a greater range of possible Qchoices that really sound good and appropriate. Diagram 7 and 8 show frequency responses with varying Q and maximum B/C.
Proportional-Q automatically readjusts the amount of boost or cut to keep the subjectively perceived loudness constant
Tips on adjusting the bandwidth
Q adjustments are largely depending on the character of the source material and whether processing single instruments or vocals or final mixes. Q values between 1 and 2 are useful to equalize vocals, guitars, keyboard sounds and suchlike. When the bandwidth is broader than half an octave it is easy to find and to manipulate the characteristic elements. Very narrow Q values (Q 3 to Q 5) are often used with high frequencies to eliminate disturbing frequencies within cymbal sounds or to precisely emphasize the kick frequency of the bass-drum or snare. Broader Qs are selected when boosting dull source material which has lost high frequency content due to de-noising, de-clicking and/or de-essing.To process bass frequencies Q values are chosen between Q 0.5 and Q 0.8. Q values between Q 0,8 and Q 1.2 are recommendable for frequencies between 100 Hz and ca. 700 Hz.
The BOOST/CUT control (B/C) of the LF and the HF frequency band provides control ranges of +/- 15 dB.
11 B/C (Boost/Cut)
Diagram 9: Symmetrical frequency responses at maximum boost and cut and high Q (+/- 15dB, Q5) for LF and HF bands.
Diagram 10: Frequency responses for max. BOOST/CUT and low Q adjustments (+/- 15dB, Q0.5) for the LF and HF bands
The BOOST/CUT control of the MF band realizes maximum boost of 15 dB and maximum cut of -36 dB. This response is called non-reciprocal response. Due to the enormous headroom of this filter design the sound of the MF band is even more open and transparent and almost unlimited in dynamic response.
Diagram 11: Non-reciprocal responses of the MF band (+/-15dB, Q5)
Stepped potentiometers for easy recall and precision adjustments of 0.5dB
All B/C controls feature stepped potentiometers with 31 detends which allow adjustments in steps of 0.5 dB. Due to the non-reciprocal response of the MF band the cut values are adjustable in 1 dB steps. Setting up procedure: When trying to locate the precise frequency range requiring adjustment, set the B/C control fully clockwise to provide maximum boost. By sweeping through the frequency ranges, it should be easy to locate the precise frequency range that needs cutting or boosting.
Diagram 12: Non-reciprocal responses of the MF band (+/-15dB, Q0.5)
Once found, the B/C control can be backed off to provide the desired degree of cut or boost and the Q setting adjusted by ear. Initially, it helps to bypass the other equalizer sections so that you can work on each equalizer independently. When the equalizer sections have been set independently, they can be switched in simultaneously with the MASTER switch and further adjustments made if required. The OUT control can be used to restore any level change caused by intensive EQ cutting or boosting. Where more subtle treatments are required, the QUREs exploitation of psychoacoustic principles enables it to significantly improve the focus, tonal balance and general clarity of detail within a mix, with the bare minimum of processing. This is particularly important when a client wants to improve the sound of a mix but doesnt want to make any significant change to the overall tonal balance. Even filter boost/cut settings of half a dB can bring about significant changes in the perceived quality of the mix being treated.
Each filter band has an individual hard-bypass switch. It makes comparison between processed and unprocessed signal easy without having to reset the B/C control as with conventional EQ designs.
LF/MF/HF ON
The QURE ON switch activates the new QURE tube and coil circuitry which is especially designed to clarify vocals and increase their presence while at the same time the dimensionality of the mix is improved. Another interesting application is to combat digital harshness. The QURE circuitry creates a sonic blur which softens harsh and edgy sounds and reduces ear fatigue.
QURE ON
Integrating a coil/condenser/ resistor filternetwork (LCR) into the signal path
The QURE ON switch puts a coil/condenser/resistor filternetwork (LCR) into the tube output stage. This network is integrated into the coupling path of the tubes and reacts on the dynamic reponse of the input signal changing THD spectra and phase responses. It sounds similar to a closed shelving bandpass frequency response, but with a time frame in which harmonics are newly created or become more present in close relation to the dynamic response of the source material. Diagrams 13 and 14 show how the harmonic content is altered of a period of 30 seconds. Diagram 13 shows a standard sweep from 1kHz to 4kHz within that time frame and the corresponding harmonical spectrum. Diagram 14 shows the treated signal with the QURE circuitry. The comparison shows, although both diagrams represent a linear frequency response, that the harmonical structure after the QURE treatment is enhanced, new harmonics have been created and existing harmonics show a more stable response. Also, so-called cross-harmonics (between the main harmonics) are more intense. What cannot be seen are the effects on phase response.
How to use the QURE circuitry
Tips on using the QURE circuitry By activating the QURE circuitry the overall output level raises inevitable by +2 dB. There are two ways to compensate for this effect. 1. Activate the QURE circuitry (Press QURE ON) which lets the output level raise by about 2 dB. Use the mid-range filter (MF) to cut harsh or annoying frequencies with a medium or broader bandwidth to achieve a linear frequency response. Use the QURE control to select the frequency range.With the SHIFT QURE switch you can jump from a high frequency range (2 kHz-6 kHz) to a lower frequency range (400 Hz-2 kHz). 2. Activate the QURE circuitry (Press QURE ON) which lets the output level raise by about 2 dB. Turn the OUT control counter clockwise and compensate for the level increase.
The QURE potentiometer changes the frequency response and produces a fresh and silky top-end and a mid-range free of sharpness and harshness. Especially vocals gain clarity and presence. They seem to step right in your face while at the same time the dimensionality of the music is getting bigger.This sound pattern is achieved by simultaneously influencing THD spectra and phase responses. The QURE potentiometer changes the center frequency of processing from 2 kHz (counter clockwise) to 6 kHz (clockwise). To process a deeper frequency spectrum use the SHIFT QURE switch (see 15).
Diagram 13: The diagram shows a frequency sweep from 1kHz to 4 kHz with the corresponding harmonical structure over a period of about 30 seconds. The frequency response is linear. The MF band is active with B/C set to zero.
Diagram 14: By activating the QUREcircuitry the harmonical content is changed. The MF-Band was used to create a linear frequency response. Now the harmonics are much more regular, almost equalized.The density is increased and also new harmonics which are missing in the upper diagram are now present.
SHIFT QURE
The SHIFT QURE switch changes the controllable frequency range of the QURE control from 2 kHz-6kHz (SHIFT QURE not active) to 400 Hz-2 kHz when the SHIFT QURE is active and the status-LED illuminates.
The signal runs through a tube circuitry featuring a Sovtek 12 AX 7 double triode tube in a mixed current/voltage coupling mode.The output stage is extremely clip-resistant and produces a pleasant and musical sounding tube-THD spectrum. The OUT-control can attentuate up to -7 dB in case that extense equalization has been used or to compensate for the 2 dB level increase when the QURE circuitry is active. Cut values are provided up to +4 dB which may be used when intensive cutting has led to a lower signal level.
Special care has gone into the design of the power supply of the QURE. The power supply is the heart of an electronic system: The better it is, the better the whole system works and in an audio system the better it sounds. This power supply is based around a custom made 35 VA torroidal transformer and is designed to minimize induced hum and noise due to the non existence of an air-gap. All required voltages (230 V, 6.3 V and 2x15 V, 12 V) have an individual wiring in the transformer and are smoothened separately afterwords. The primary voltage may be selected between 230 V/50 Hz and 115 V/60 Hz by means of a recessed slide switch on the rear panel. The rear-panel ground-lift switch may be used where ground loops are causing hum problems.When the GND LIFT switch is set to off, the circuit ground is no longer connected to the chassis ground.The power cord connector is a 3-wire, U-ground, standard IEC mains connector for a detachable power cord (enclosed) with an inbuilt mains filter. Transformer, power cord and mains connector have VDE, UL and CSA approvals. At 115 V/60 Hz the fuse value for the primary voltage is 1A and for 230 V/50 Hz the fuse is 500 mA.
Power Supply
Custom made torroidal transformer with five separate wirings.
Voltage selector Ground-lift switch Mains filter
FUSES (primary voltages): 115 V: 1A 230 V: 500 mA
On the secondary side of the power supply, an RC combination is used to filter out noise and hum voltages from the mains side. Both half-waves are smoothed with 6000 microFarad capacitors in the positive and negative voltage path (recommended PREMIUM version: 28.200 microFarad). Both pathes use precision voltage regulators, as deviations of only a few millivolts can result in audible changes such as a diffuse sound pattern. The operational voltage of the tubes (275 V) is heavily smoothened and electronically regulated.The heating voltage (6.3 V) is supplied by an individuell wiring within the transformer. Socalled hum-trimmers adjust the tubes heating voltage and minimize the hum voltages. Both inputs and outputs of the tubes are smoothened with condensers of high voltage and condenser values (1 microFarad/ 400 V/5%) to minimize offset voltages. The tubes are de-coupled at about 10 Hz. All relays are operated via an individual voltage regulator and are therefore separated from the audio operating voltage.
Extensive filtering and decoupling guarantee stable power and avoid audible changes such as a diffuse sound pattern.

If you’ve ever met a senior dog with vision problems, you know the whitish cloud that can hang over the dog’s eyes. Sometimes caused by cataracts in an aging dog, this condition becomes even more apparent in photographs. To remedy this issue and add some spunk back into Lilly Belle’s eyes, use your Burn tool in Photoshop to do the following:..
Choose the Lasso tool from the Tools palette and use it to trace the circumference of the dog’s eyeball.
Be careful to leave a small cushion of space between the outline and the dog’s eyelids.
With your Lasso tool still selected and the eyeball outlined, go to the Photoshop toolbar and choose Select→Modify→Feather.
Enter 3 for the Feather Radius and click OK.
Use feathering to soften the edges of a selection so that whatever adjustments you make to the selected area smoothly transition into the surrounding area. If you don’t use feathering, you may end up with an obvious hard edge defining the selection area you used.
Choose the Burn tool from the Tools palette and head up to the Brush Picker drop-down menu, which appears in the Options bar on the upper left-hand side of the screen.
Drag the Master Diameter slider to adjust the size of your Burn tool. Choose a diameter that’s slightly larger than your selection. Also, make sure that Protect Tones is checked in the Options bar.
Adjacent to the Brush Picker drop-down menu are the Range and Exposure drop-down menus.
Choose Midtones for your Range and start with a low exposure percentage, like 12 percent. The Range options dictate which tones are actually affected by the Burn tool.
Choosing Midtones forces the Burn tool to darken only the middle ranges, leaving the highlighted and shadowed areas unaffected. Choosing Shadows forces the Burn Tool to darken only the darkest shadowed areas, and choosing Highlights forces the Burn tool to darken only the lightest areas. Because cloudy eyes are usually made up of mid-toned grays, start with Midtones as your range.
Position the Burn tool over your selected eyeball, click, and move the Burn tool in a circular motion over your selected area.
The longer you hold down the mouse button, the more you’ll burn in the area, so make sure you constantly move the tool while you’re clicking to prevent any one area from becoming darker than the rest. You’ll see the cloudy area of the eyeball darken in real time.
Release the mouse button to view your results.
If the eyes are still too light, simply take another pass to the selected area with your Burn tool.
After a few passes, if the effects of burning still aren’t satisfactory, try choosing Highlights instead of Midtones from the drop-down Range menu.Dads, daughters rock the hangar
AM2 Kevin Ramey of Carrier Airborne Early Warning Squadron (VAW) 116 sees nothing but joy on the face of his daughter, Jilliana, 4, during a Daddy-Daughter Dance Saturday, April 26.
Lt. Cmdr. Ryan Overholtzer of Carrier Airborne Early Warning Squadron (VAW) 116 dances with his 10-year-old daughter, Kyla, during the Daddy-Daughter Dance.
AT1 Jason Crawford of Carrier Airborne Early Warning Squadron (VAW) 116 dances with his 6-year-old daughter, Lila, during the Daddy-Daughter Dance in the E-2 Hawkeye hangar.
Fathers and daughters shared some tender moments Saturday, April 26, as the Family Readiness Group (FRG) for Carrier Airborne Early Warning Squadron (VAW) 116 hosted a Daddy-Daughter Dance for the E-2 squadrons at Naval Base Ventura County (NBVC) Point Mugu.
Girls wearing frilly dresses and dads in suits and ties twirled to the music in the cavernous E-2 hangar in Hawkeye Country. About 50 people attended.
“I don’t always get the opportunity to have a date with my daughter,” said Lt. Cmdr. John Qualters of VAW-117, who came with his 4-year-old, Kate. “This is going to be great.”
Organizer Megan Ramey, president of the FRG, said that between trainings and deployments, military parents don’t get much time with their children.
“We wanted to do something just for them,” she said.
Among those enjoying the moment were her daughter, Jilliana, 4, as she danced with her daddy, Aviation Structural Mechanic 2nd Class Kevin Ramey.
“It’s pretty cool,” said Dad.Northern Forest Research:
Public Access to Private Lands in the Northern Forest
Lisa Chase, Walt Kuentzel, University of Vermont
Tom Brown, Cornell University
John Daigle, University of Maine
Robert Robertson, University of New Hampshire
Goal: Conduct studies on land tenure changes and access trends including primary data collection on landowners’ attitudes and behaviors related to access, easements, and secondary income. Evaluate the extent to which limited liability recreation statutes adequately protect landowners.
Outcomes and Products: Land tenure changes, globalization of the timber industry, growing recreational demand, and new conservation easements have all contributed to the changing landscape of the Northern Forest region. Study findings indicated that almost half of private landowners have not limited recreational access to their lands in the past ten years, and less than 10% have closed off their land completely. Despite this level of access, the perception held by the majority of private landowners suggests that public access in the region has decreased over the same ten years. In addition, many private landowners are not well-informed about liability protection offered them by state statutes, while large investment landowners tend to be more familiar with landowner liability statutes.

Background
One of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's key responsibilities is to ensure the operation of nuclear power plants and other NRC-licensed facilities present no undue risk to public health and safety. The agency does this by applying and enforcing a set of technical requirements on plant design and operations, described in Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR). Generally, these are written in terms of traditional engineering practices such as "safety margins" in design, construction, and operations. Probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) systematically looks at how the pieces of a complex system work together to ensure safety. PRA allows analysts to quantify risk and identify what could have the most impact on safety.
Risk
Risk is determined by two factors:
- How often might a particular hazard arise?
- How much harm is likely to result?
Risk is reduced in two ways: by making an undesirable event less likely or by making its outcome less serious. The NRC and the nuclear industry use PRA as one way to evaluate overall risk.
Risk Assessment Methods
To perform a PRA, analysts go through many steps:
First, they specify the hazard – the outcome(s) to be prevented or reduced. (For nuclear power plants, "core damage" is often used. The core is where the nuclear fuel is arranged, and it is the first physical barrier between radioactivity and the public.)
Analysts then identify initiating events – those that could possibly lead to the specified consequence (e.g., breakage of a pipe carrying reactor coolant).
Analysts then estimate the frequency of each initiating event (answering questions such as, "How often do we expect a pipe of this size to break?").
Assuming that the initiating event has occurred, analysts identify each combination of failures (e.g., pump failure and valve failure) that lead to a specific outcome.
The likelihood of each combination is then computed. The probabilities of all those sequences that lead to the same outcome are added. To determine how often this outcome might occur, these probabilities are multiplied by the frequency of the initiating event(s).
Modern PRA uses several specific techniques to accomplish this analysis:
Event trees model the plant response to each initiating event.
Fault trees model plant systems in detail. Analysts use fault trees to identify the combinations of failures that cause the overall system to fail. Then, the fault tree logic is used to calculate the overall failure probability. Analysts pay particular attention to problems that can fail more than one component at the same time.
Human reliability analysis (HRA) is used to evaluate human errors that are important to the outcome of an event. Analysts assess the probability of a mistake in light of factors like training, procedures, and expected conditions during an event.
Monte Carlo methods are used to compute the risks. This technique allows analysts to consider variations in each factor of the analysis, imperfect knowledge, as well as the many possible ways the factors can interact.
Types of Risk Assessments
Even a basic PRA model takes a lot of effort. Fortunately, the speed and power of modern computers allows analysts to use, re-use, and refine each PRA model to address many questions. The most common nuclear power plant PRAs deal with "internal events" – those that start inside the power plant or the electric system it serves. "External event" PRAs deal with initiating events like earthquakes and hurricanes. Special PRAs are used to address unique problems such as spent nuclear fuel storage cask design or the geology of a potential repository site for high-level radioactive waste.
In the nuclear power industry, analysts label PRAs by "level."
A Level 1 PRA estimates the frequency of core damage. It starts with conditions that are well known, usually with a reactor operating at full power. All of the systems that work to protect the reactor are modeled. Since the workings of these systems are well understood, the uncertainty of the result is relatively small.
A Level 2 PRA estimates the magnitude and timing of releases. (That is, "Assuming that the core is damaged, how much radioactivity might escape into the environment?") Uncertainty associated with how much coolant escapes the reactor systems (and how violently), as well as variation in containment system response, makes a Level 2 PRA less precise than a Level 1 PRA.
A Level 3 PRA assesses the injuries and economic losses that might result if radioactivity escaped from containment. Highly variable factors like wind speed and direction will affect the results.
Risk Assessment Results
PRA results are complex. They do not take the form of a single number. Instead, PRA provides a spectrum of possible outcomes. The frequency with which each of these outcomes is expected is a distribution of values. While it is convenient to summarize the results of a PRA using a single representative value (called a point estimate), it is also important to understand how much larger or smaller the actual risks might be.
This uncertainty in the result is partly because reality is more complex than any computer model, partly because modelers do not know everything, and partly because of chance. A certain level of confidence that adequate safety is achieved can be met in either of two ways:
Imposing a large enough safety margin to "bound" the risk; or
Reducing the uncertainty so that a smaller margin can provide the same (or better) confidence of safety.
Analysts can reduce uncertainty by a) refining their models to more accurately reflect the real world; b) doing research to better understand the physics of what they model; or c) collecting additional data to improve the precision of their models. The NRC does all of these.
NRC Uses of PRA
The NRC developed the first nuclear power plant PRA applications in the 1970s. In the decades that followed, analysts refined their methods and developed new insights on risk. Today, the NRC uses these insights to complement traditional engineering methods when making regulatory decisions about power plants, medical uses of nuclear materials, and the handling of nuclear waste. This is a "risk-informed" approach to regulation, which has included:
NRC initiatives to have plants perform integrated plant evaluations (using PRA) to discover and correct subtle vulnerabilities, resulting in significant improvements to reactor safety.
Using PRA insights, inspection programs have shifted their focus to the plant systems, operations and human performance that are most important to safety.
The reactor oversight program includes a significance determination process (SDP) based on PRA models of each plant. When a piece of equipment fails or is taken out of service for maintenance, its safety significance is assessed. The NRC increases its resources for overseeing nuclear plants as they encounter problems of increasing risk importance.
In writing or modifying regulations, the NRC often uses PRA to confirm that the new rules are rigorous enough to cover uncertainties – and that new rules include only justifiable requirements.
PRA is one of several methods used for risk-informed, performance-based regulation of nuclear materials.
PRA has been used for special analyses, for example, to assess the safety of spent fuel storage casks.
The nuclear industry uses PRA, too:
Existing plant designs are improved by reducing vulnerabilities discovered through PRA.
When multiple systems are undergoing maintenance, PRA ensures risk remains low.
Risk-informed technical specifications and risk-informed in-service inspection programs are used to focus resources on systems and components most significant to safety.
New reactor designs can be improved prior to submitting applications for certification by the NRC.
PRA use is expected to continue growing as part of a longstanding NRC policy for increased use in all regulatory matters. This should result in a more predictable and timely regulatory approach throughout the agency.

Tottori鳥取県
Adorable spirit monsters known as 'yokai' welcome you to the admirable port city of Sakaiminato. Yonago, a representative commercial city of the San'in region.
The city of Sakaiminato is located in the western section of Tottori Prefecture. Sakaiminato is known from old as an outstanding fishery city on the Sea of Japan side, and it thrived as a base for trade with the Asian Continent. Even today, it boasts of having one of the largest hauls of crab and tuna in Japan. The Yumigahama Peninsula, with its green pine trees growing along a stretch of white sand shaped like a bow, is known for its beautiful scenery and is a mecca for marine sports.
The city's landmark is the 43-meter-tall Yumeminato Tower that stands in Yumeminato Park. The observation room on the top floor offers a magnificent 360-degree view, which of course includes the Sea of Japan and the majestic Mt. Daisen. As you walk through the city, you will be greeted by bronze statues of 'yokai,' the adorable apparition that in recent years has become the new face of the city. Sakaiminato is the hometown of Shigeru Mizuki, a Japanese 'manga' comic author best known for his horror manga "GeGeGe-no-Kitaro." The city has named its main road the "Mizuki Shigeru Road," and about 100 bronze yokai statues now line the street. The sight leaves animated cartoon fans speechless.
Next door to Sakaiminato is the city of Yonago, a representative commercial city of the San'in region. With both air routes and sea routes, the city serves as a gateway to the entire region. The city has a long history of commerce, and it has continued to prosper since the days that it served as a castle town during the Edo Period.
Many remnants of its long history can be found throughout the city. A stroll along the Kamo River will take you past traditional white-walled storehouses and 'nagayamon,' a gate of tenements. The Yodoe-cho district is known for its clear water, which bubbles up at several locations. There is a walking course that passes by many sites of interest, and even 'ashiyu (hot spring foot baths)' along the way for you to enjoy.
At the Kaike Onsen, located about 15 minutes from Yonago Station, you can soak in the soothing waters springing forth from the sea. The hot spring can even be enjoyed as part of a day trip, so please be sure to visit there.

The app currently works on Android phones running OS version 2.1 and higher, though Qik doesn’t seem to be available for Android 3.0–fueled tablets quite yet. For the Apple crowd, all iPhone 4 users can run the app, as well as those with an iPad 2 or a camera-equipped iPod Touch.
Qik isn’t the only app-maker with skin in the peacemaking game. Fring, another mobile video chat app, offers the same cross-platform capabilities that Qik is debuting. And in a move that smells of one-upmanship, Fring sent out invites to beta testers Tuesday for its group-video-chat mode, where users can connect to up to three other friends simultaneously.
Skype — which owns Qik and is easily the best known name in internet telephony — doesn’t do video conference calling at all on mobile devices, though it is available for the iPhone and for some, carrier-specified Android devices. [Added the word “conference” after a commenter correctly reminded me that even I’ve done Skype mobile video calls …: JCAbell]
When Sprint’s HTC Evo 4G phone dropped last summer, it was the first Android device to come with a front-facing camera and Qik’s preloaded chat software. At the time, Sprint was the fastest to deploy its 4G networks in the United States: More bandwidth meant better connections and better possibilities for video chatting.
Of course, it’s 2011 and broadband wireless connections aren’t as scarce as they once were. AT&T and Verizon have already started to roll out their respective 4G networks across the country, and front-facing cameras are practically mandatory for this year’s high-end smartphone debuts. While not yet commonplace, two-way mobile video calling is approaching the mainstream, and companies like Qik and Fring will need to work hard to compete for share.
When Skype purchased Qik in January, it was expected that the Qik brand would be discontinued and folded into Skype’s services. But as today’s release suggests, Skype doesn’t seem to have plans to quickly shut Qik.
Whatever the application, we’re just excited to see the two factions can finally talk it out — face-to-face.

- Andreessen Puts His Money on QikThe California GOP Convention is set this weekend for Anaheim and I’m not sure where to send flowers for the wake. The party is clearly on life support. Governor Jerry Brown’s progressive agenda and the complete Democratic Control in the legislature have turned California’s gloomy outlook under a Republican governor and millions of dollars in the red into a rosy economic future. The State has gay marriage, driver’s licenses for undocumented immigrants, initiatives for high speed rail and a healthcare program in place that’s already more aggressive than Obamacare.
Add to this the diminishing number of voters who identify themselves as “Republican” and people like Jon Fleischman in a party leadership position who’s only goal is to push candidates further to the right, and the prospects look dim and grim.
Governor Brown and his legislative Democratic electeds were able to clean up the mess left behind by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and the legislative minority Republicans who had the ability to block critical legislation. Remove those obstacles and things have certainly gotten better in the Golden State with no thanks to Republicans.
Marty Wisckoll does a nice job summing up the party’s dire straights in this paywall-free story on the Register (so is the Register promoting the convention in a way?). From Marty’s story:.
The Republicans plan all sorts of roundtables to reach out to women, Latinos, Asian voters (but no LGBT outreach I’m afraid) to communicate their message to them. I seem to recall a line about these voters by supporting Republicans is akin to chickens supporting Col. Sanders.
More from Marty’s story:
Republican leaders generally have been opposed to immigration reform..”
So there you have it; Nguyen versus Solorio is the California GOP’s number one priority. It going to be fun watching the Republicans and Democrats pour their resources into this race. But one thing is clear. The more party leaders like Jon Fleischman steer the party to the hard right the more people will jump this sinking ship. California’s resurgence is due to Progressive policies of cutting spending where necessary and increasing spending selectively. It worked. And it’s impossible to deny. It’s time for Republicans to be treated like the minority party they are.
Geez Dan,
Don’t tell them. Encourage them to stay the course and resist any effort to change.
Solorio is too hated in the district and more importantly amongst democratic pillar groups to solidify the base. He has a lot of money from the insurance companies buoying up his accounts, but that is for prostituting himself to the insurance companies for years. Solorio cannot win this race, because too many dems would be happy to see him go down in flames.Practicing.

''A small Scottish fishing village, known for harvesting tench, held annual contests to see who could eat the most of the fish at one sitting. In 1990 Graham Hicks, a local from the town of Fife, reached the final round against Sven Larssen from Norway. In a best-of-five contest, Hicks won the first three rounds, eating a total of 11 tench, beating his Scandinavian rival by two. The local paper, The Bridge Bugle, summed up the result with the following headline: 'One to three for Fife's Hicks; Sven ate nine tench'. I can't vouch for its veracity as a real headline, but if the above is not true, then it should be.'' Too right!
Here is a lesser example of subediting in action, from the Grafton Daily Examiner on Monday, as spotted by Anne Moore, of Waverley: ''The new Jacaranda Queen took to her thrown at Saturday night's crowning ceremony.''
''The recent correspondence about taxi radio calls [Column 8, since Wednesday] reminded me of the shorthand 'M' codes used to minimise radio time,'' writes Andrew Mowat, of Beecroft. ''My favourite moment in the Premier Cabs radio room was hearing a driver call for help as his passenger was as 'M11'd as a newt'. Ah, the days before computer dispatch systems … ''
But voice broadcasting carries its own risks. ''I've been driving taxis in Sydney so long I remember not only when radio jobs were given by voice,'' recalls Neville Crombie, of Kingsford, ''but being asked to go and buy gaspers, lozenges or other such 'essentials' and deliver them to clients. Oft retold is the tale of the hapless driver dispatched to buy '10 bags of ice' who delivered 10 bags of rice.''
'''Swinging the lead' refers to the easy job of tossing a piece of lead (attached to a rope) overboard and calling out the depth of water under a ship's keel,'' writes Graham Dodge, of Marsfield (Euphemisms for chucking a sickie, Column 8 yesterday). ''It was an essential task when sailing ships of yore were travelling in shallow waters but has been obsolete since the invention of depth sounders. Some decades ago I knew a doctor who would inform parents of malingering children that he suspected a severe case of 'oscillating plumbism' but that no treatment was necessary, as it should clear up as the weekend approached.''
''Spotted yesterday,'' reports Edward Loong, of Milsons Point, ''an allegedly homeless fellow sitting on a footpath in the city with a sign that read 'Will accept Visa and American Express cards'. So forget the feeble excuses, like not having any change.''
Christopher J. Woods, C8PhD of Mount Victoria, notes the conferring of said degree on Les Nixon on Monday (for services to racing), and points out that ''since the first C8PhD on June 21, 2006, Column 8 has now awarded 25. Only two women have been awarded one. Can anyone suggest why the gender difference?'' We are appalled at this discrepancy and an urgent meeting of the Column 8 Academic Senate has been called to address the matter.

Unknown gunmen on Saturday threw an Improvised Explosive Device at the convoy of the Emir of Kano, Ado Bayero, and then shot at his official vehicle, killing his driver and three of his guards on Saturday morning.
The attack took place near the Hockey Field on Zoo Road by Total Gasoline station when the Emir was returning from the inauguration of an Islamic school at Mussalaci Murtala.
The News Agency of Nigeria reports that the Emir was unhurt in the attack and was moved to an undisclosed location.
Some residents in the area said men of the Joint Task Force later got to the scene of the attack and shot sporadically.
JTF spokesperson in Kano, Captain Ikedichi Iweha, said he was still trying to get the full details of the attack for him to release an official incident report.
However, Kano State Governor, Rabiu Kwankwaso, confirmed that four people died during the attack.
Meanwhile, the Deputy Chairman, National Union of Road Transport Workers in Oyo State, Mr. Kamorudeen Beyioku, died on Saturday while receiving treatment at the University College Hospital, Ibadan.
Beyioku was shot earlier in the week by unknown gunmen.Skate [Slate] – Finish Line with Elena Corrigall

As per the last time, I've left out the "card" part of this, because that is only useful for non-DT setups, which aren't supported in mainline. The first seven patches have already been applied by Mark, and are included here for completeness by anyone who wishes to test this series. There is very little change between this and the previous set of patches. The HACK patch is gone, as I've found out through much digging and experimentation with DAPM (inspite of the complete lack of assistance from ASoC developers) how to use the stream widgets without the widget overwriting bug getting in the way. The CPU DAI widgets are attached to the CPU DAI context, and their access to the driver private data updated accordingly. Why attaching them to the CPU DAI context previously didn't work, I'm not entirely sure, but that certainly previously failed in testing (it may have been due to the duplicated DAI routes and/or the lack of output pin on the SPDIF tranceiver.) I've added three patches: one to add IEC958 channel status setting, another to prefer the external clock over the internal clock, and removal of the IEC958 subframe support (see the commit message for that patch why this can not be supported.) This is a non-DPCM driver, and is the absolute minimum solution which can provide correct hardware behaviour while still being conformant with single zImage kernels and not causing any known regressions." }, }; When DPCM is eventually implemented, the DAPM route remains, the DAI link becomes two, as previously illustrated in other discussions.

Customized Financial Transactions -- Biometrics in Banking
(Marketwire Via Acquire Media NewsEdge) BERLIN, GERMANY and DARMSTADT, GERMANY -- (Marketwired) -- 04/15/14 -- Nowadays, banking is done online. Transactions are executed from anywhere in the world via computers, tablets or smartphones. Especially in the mobile area, any banking business should be well secured and personalized. Previous procedures such as certain account data, PIN and bank cards involve risks. Should they fall into the hands of unauthorized third parties, the accounts are quickly emptied. There is a lack of options for a direct identity link in banking.
Biometrics offers the solution. This is how it works: Machines recognize a person by means of his or her physical features. This might be fingerprints, hand-vein patterns or iris structures -- but also physiological characteristics, such as signature or voice. These biometric features are very individual and allow for a reliable, person-specific identification. "Especially in banking, the identity link is very important to ensure the legitimacy of banking transactions," explains Alexander Nouak, Chairman of the "European Association for Biometrics" and head of the "Identification and Biometrics" Competence Center at Fraunhofer IGD.
In the recent past, the approach of using biometrics in banking has experienced a new boost. "Since some smartphones have even been able to recognize their users owing to biometrics, we have seen an increasing interest in using similar procedures," explains Waldemar Grudzien, Director of the "Retail Banking, Banking Technology" business unit in the Association of German Banks.
Suitable options are hand-vein and fingerprint scanners or signature recognition, for instance. "In the process, the security of the biometric data plays a decisive role," stresses Nouak.
The participants of the workshop "Biometrics in Banking" will discuss biometric systems to personalize banking transactions at the Association of German Banks in Berlin on 21 May 2014. International companies will present their current procedures, and biometrics researchers will discuss future applications with the workshop participants.

A valet apparently forgot to put this car in park, Saturday night. It was 15 feet underwater by Sunday morning.
The car was parked at a dock in Fort Myers Beach when it started to roll then went into the water.
No one was inside the car at the time.
Divers helped pull the car back out, Sunday.
It's not clear whether the car ended up with any scratches, but -- as you can see -- the owner is probably a little more concerned about the water damage at this point.

All you really want to know is which option will suit you best. So, to help clarify what ‘Assisted Living Serices’ means, the following is a general overview of an Assisted Living environment and the services provided.
Explore Assisted Living in (BC) British Columbia
First, the basics
There are three specific components to Assisted Living -- housing, hospitality services and personal assistance.
1. Housing
There’s no ‘typical’ Assisted Living residence; it may be a one or two-bedroom apartment, or bachelor suite in a condo complex or apartment building. It may be a suite in a home with separate entrance and bedroom, and shared dining or living areas. It may be a retirement residence built specifically to include Assisted Living accommodations or it may be among a variety of residences on a campus of care.
Assisted Living residences are usually located close to shopping, medical care facilities, and transit. Sometimes residences can be found in close proximity to family and friends -- for that reason, it’s important to begin your search in regions and neighborhoods that interest you.
2. Hospitality Services
In the Assisted Living environment, the following are referred to as hospitality services:
- Meals -- one to three balanced meals plus snacks. Health and safety standards will be followed in their preparation and service. If a resident requires a special or therapeutic diet, the can get professional advice from a registered dietician.
- Housekeeping -- light housekeeping is provided according to the health and safety needs of the individual.
- Laundry -- this usually includes weekly laundering, folding and storing of bedding; equipment is provided if the resident takes care of their own personal laundry.
- Recreational and social opportunities -- community involvement, as well as opportunities for leisure and social interaction is provided.
- 24-hour emergency response system -- residents will be able to request assistance in the event of an emergency at any time of day or night.
- Additional services may be provided for example, trips to medical appointments.
3. Personal assistance
Personal assistance is provided depending upon the needs of the individual. These are the most commonly requested services in the senior Assisted Living environment:
- Assistance with the activities of daily life (ADL) such as eating, dressing, grooming, bathing and personal hygiene
- Medication management
- Care in following a prescribed or therapeutic diet
Additional services offered may include personal property and financial management, physical and psychosocial rehabilitative therapies, behavior management and intervention, hairdressing and escorts to medical appointments. To provide suitable services or a service package, the senior with the support of family, a case manager and the residence operator will work together to determine a service package that meets the needs of the individual.
Written by Alice LucetteApparently so, according to this petition over at change.org. I don’t quite follow the logic, considering I have bigger concerns for the film, among them the question of how the producers of the film intend to keep everything strictly cinema-safe and still retain the major draw of the story. That being the gobs of filthy, filthy, explicit sex. Fifty Shades of Grey is porn, which is fine. It’s porn for women, which is great. Sanitizing it for international release sort of defeats the point.
But many people (more than eighty six thousand of them, as of this moment) are singularly displeased with the decision to cast Charlie Hunnam (Queer as Folk, Pacific Rim) and Dakota Johnson (21 Jump Street, Beastly) as the leading man and lady. I understand the chafing at Hunnam’s casting best, since he looks far too… chummy, let’s say, for the role. He has a face and (from what little I’ve seen of him) a presence for romantic comedies, not the raunchiness of Fifty Shades.
That isn’t to say I prefer apparent fan favorite Matt Bomer. He has one of those smarmy fist-magnet faces that I find a little repellent, though he’s objectively an attractive guy. If he’s your ideal Christian then by all means visit the link at the top of the page and let the world know.
As for me, I’m not sure I’ll even go see this one. The book didn’t do too much for me and I don’t know if I could sit through two hours of the script dancing around the fact that it started out as something much more explicit.
What do you think of the casting, my little sunflowers?Rob Howley will lead Wales on the three-Test tour and Jones insists there is a collective duty to ensure the Dragons continue to roar.
"It's a reciprocal thing now Warren is out and we have to work together," said the 2009 Lion.
"When Sam (Warburton) was injured in the Six Nations all the players stepped up to the mark and backed the management. Now Warren is out of the tour the management will step in.
"I'm sure Howls (Howley) will do a good job, but it's also down to the players to step up and help them."
Jones still reckons Wales have a golden opportunity to secure a southern hemisphere scalp against the Lions next opponents despite Gatland's absence.
But the second-row insists Wales cannot afford to make the same mistakes as following the 2008 Grand Slam and must continue to build on this season's progress.
He added: "In 2008, it was all change and all new. Gats came in and bang we won the Grand Slam but we didn't back it up.
"But there's a big opportunity now with the core of the side not only from the Grand Slam but the World Cup as well.
"We have that consistency and if we can keep it together for a third time in the summer then it bodes very well for the future. We can do really well down there."New Zealand Embassy Ha Noi, Viet Nam
Scams in Viet Nam
Foreigners visiting or living in Viet Nam can become victims of scams or petty crime.
Relationship Fraud
It is not uncommon for locals to enter into marriages with foreign citizens solely for financial or immigration purposes. Relationships developed through correspondance, especially those initiated on the internet, are particularly susceptible to manipulation.
Marriage to a New Zealand citizen does not confer New Zealand citizenship, nor does it make the new spouse automatically eligible for entry into New Zealand. A foreign spouse requires a temporary entry visa to enter and visit New Zealand. Please ensure that if you intend for your partner/spouse to travel to New Zealand with you or to visit you, you are aware of the visa requirements that must be met as defined by Immigration New Zealand.
Card scams
These from ATM machines. Avoid getting involved in card games. your card out of your sight.
When using cards in ATMs choose a machine that is attended by guards or in a busy place. Look to see that the ATM has not been tampered with. Cover your hand when entering your PIN.
Taxi scams
Taxis are the recommended form of public transportation in Viet Nam. There are plenty of reputable taxi companies in Viet Nam, however some taxi companies and/or individuals are giving the industry a bad reputation. Some drivers will take a detour or will request cash payment instead of using the meter. Always request that the meter is used and always give the taxi driver the full address of your destination.
Petty crime
As with many other countries, petty crime is common in Viet Nam. Whilst travelling, be very aware at all times as opportunists may snatch or slash open your belongings.
Visitors and residents should be alert to being targeted by even the friendliest of people. Never put yourself in vulnerable situations and look out for the safety of your travelling companions..Physicians for Human RightsUsing science and medicine to stop human rights violations

It's hard for the carers to farewell an animal they have lovingly reared from infancy and whom they have come to know well. When they go home they will be surrounded by reminders of the animal who has shared their home, and whom they will never see again.
Like all the wombats that are brought to Onemilebridge for release, Bonney was rescued after the death of her mother and raised by human carers who bottle fed, bathed and nurtured her.
Like all the wombats that are brought to Onemilebridge for release, Bonney was rescued after the death of her mother and raised by human carers who bottle fed, bathed and nurtured her.
These carers were available day and night to ensure her survival, and the bond between wombat and foster parent is very strong. Bonney has clearly been well loved and cared for. Wombats raised with kindness by humans repay the affection.
When we put Bonney into the pen that will be her temporary home (otherwise known as the Wombat Hilton) she immediately set off to explore. She ran down the two burrows that her predecessors have dug, she jogged in and out of the various shelters, and she sniffed at the pyjamas that accompanied her and that are now in the kennel in the pen to provide a familiar scent and reminder of home. She stopped briefly at the bowl of oats we put out for her but she was too excited to eat any.
We as releasers have a specific task. We have to undo some of the human-dependent habits the wombats have developed and prepare them for life in the wild.
As long as Bonney remains in the pen we won't interact directly with her at all, though we will observe her closely, feed and water her daily, and collect her droppings. In the beginning we expect her droppings to be loose because she will be stressed by this separation from what she regards as her home, but after a few days they should begin to be solid again.
When Bonney approaches for a cuddle we will ignore her. She will learn not to expect companionship from humans. We will resist the temptation to enjoy her company ourselves.
It seems apparent that Bonney is a naturally curious and resilient animal. She has already begun to dig and explore. We hope that in a few weeks we will unlatch the hatch in the pen's door and that then Bonney will take her place amongst the wild wombats, hopefully mating and raising a new generation of wombats in this area.
There is already another female wombat on the waiting list for the Wombat Hilton.

I am crying after reading your wonderful post. I am crying for the mother who was killed leaving an orphan behind, for the wonderful relationship between the foster parents and that wombat, for the huge smile on her face in that second photo, because she doesn't know that she's about to be abandoned again and for her great big optimistic future. Thanks for that wonderful post. X
I too am utterly moved by this post, the story of Bonney the death of her mother, the amazing strength of both her and the carers to love and care for something knowing she will not be with them forever. And also it is amazing and wonderful that you facilitate your part in her becoming wild. thank youxTHEY'VE been hanging on by their fingernails for weeks now and Hearts desperate battle to stay in the top flight for as long as possible continued at Firhill against Partick Thistle.

Geneva 2’s mood mirrored the sound of mortar and despair on the ground in Syria. Not much of substance came of the former, as the U.N.-Arab League envoy Lakhdar Brahimi tiredly indicated that diplomacy continued despite the lack of a breakthrough. He hoped that the United States and the Russians would pressure their clients to remain at the table, from where, for three weeks, little of value has emerged. No agreement can come of these peace talks for at least two reasons. First, the government of Bashar Assad and the rebel coalition do not agree on the interpretation of the conflict. Mr. Assad argues that this is a war against terrorism (Al-Qaeda), while the rebels argue that this is a war against authoritarianism (the Assad government). Second, the rebels themselves are deeply fractured, with the Islamists in Syria who are doing the brunt of the fighting indisposed to any peace talks.
Mr. Brahimi hoped that humanitarian relief would be the glue to hold the two sides together. Residents in the old city of Homs and in the Palestinian neighbourhood of Yarmouk in Damascus have been under siege for two years. It was hoped that safe passage could be provided for food and medicine, but this was not accomplished. U.N. and Islamic Red Cross workers bravely avoided snipers and shells to transport food and medicines to the Syrians; children among them stared at fresh fruit, unsure of what to do with it. Absent momentum from Geneva, the options for a regional solution are back on the table.Role for India, China?
In 2012, Egypt convened the Syria Contact Group that comprised Iran, Saudi Arabia and Turkey — unlikely partners. Pressure from the U.S. and Russia at that time closed down the Group. Today, the regional partners seek an exit from their exaggerated postures over Syria, but there is no diplomatic space for them to act. It falls to powers that are untainted by the war, perhaps China and India, to call for a meeting — a Beijing or New Delhi summit — to craft a serious agenda to pressure all sides to a ceasefire and a credible political process.
The war is now fought less on the ground and more over its interpretation. Expectations of a hasty collapse of the government withdraw as the Syrian Army takes Jarajir, along the Lebanon border. Islamists groups continue to fight against each other in the north, weakening their firepower as the Syrian army watches from the sidelines. The emboldened Syrian government has now stepped up its rhetoric about this war being essentially one against terrorists with affiliation to al-Qaeda. Ears that once rejected this narrative in the West and Turkey are now increasingly sympathetic to it. As the Islamists suffocate the rebellion, it becomes hard to champion them against the government. Focus has moved away from the prisons and barrel bombs of the government to the executions and social policies of the Islamists.
A year ago, the West and Turkey would have scoffed at talk of terrorism as the fantasy of the Assad government. The West and the Gulf Arabs had opened their coffers to the rebels, knowing full well that they were incubating the growth of the Islamist factions at the expense of the secular opposition. Turkey’s government of Recep Tayyip Erdog˘an micromanaged the opposition, provided bases in Turkey and allowed well-armed fighters to slip across the border into Syria. By early 2012, it had become a common sight to see well-armed Islamist fighters in the streets of Antakya and in the refugee camps in Hatay Province. The seeds of what was to come — the entry of al-Qaeda into Syria — was set by an opportunistic and poorly conceived policy by Erdog˘an’s government. It did not help that his otherwise well-spoken and highly-regarded Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutog˘lu began to refer to Syria’s Alawites (Mr. Assad’s community) as Nusayri, a derogatory sectarian term. Turkey joined U.S., Europe and Gulf Arab calls for Mr. Assad’s departure well before the numbers of those dead climbed above the thousands. Nervousness about the spread of al-Qaeda to Syria has made the rebels’ patrons edge closer to the Damascus narrative. The U.S. government wishes to arm the Iraqi government with Hellfire missiles and drones to combat the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) in Iraq’s Anbar Province. Britain has said that any fighter who comes back from Syria will be arrested (last week, a Sussex man — Abu Suleiman al-Britani — conducted a suicide operation in Aleppo). The Saudi Royal Court decreed that any Saudi found to have waged jihad abroad could spend up to 20 years in prison.
General Mansour al-Turki of the Saudi Interior Ministry said: “We are trying to stop everyone who wants to go to Syria, but we can’t stop leaks.” The Turkish Armed Forces fired on an ISIS convoy on January 28 inside Syria, and told the government in a report prepared jointly with the Turkish National Intelligence agency that al-Qaeda had made credible threats on Turkey. Mr. Erdog˘an hastened to Tehran to meet the new Iranian leadership — their public comments were on trade, but their private meetings were all on Syria and the need to combat the rise of terrorism. What Mr. Assad had warned about in 2012 came to pass — for whatever reason — and led to a loss of confidence among the rebels’ patrons for their future. Even al-Qaeda’s putative leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri, has sought to distance himself from ISIS. These signs indicate that on Syria, the “terrorism narrative” has come to dominate over the “authoritarian regime narrative.”Islamic Front
The fractious Syrian opposition that came to Geneva does not represent the main columns of rebel fighters on the ground. These are mainly Islamists — with the al-Qaeda wing represented by ISIS and Jabhat al-Nusra, and the rest represented by the Islamic Front. They have no appetite for negotiation. Mr. Abu Omar of the Islamic Front said that Syria’s future would be created “here on the ground of heroism, and signed with blood on the frontlines, not in hollow conferences attended by those who don’t even represent themselves.” A U.S. intelligence official told me that when the U.S. went into Afghanistan in 2001, “We smashed the mercury and watched it spread out slowly in the area.” U.S. occupation and the sectarian governance of the current government. There they worked with Jabhat al-Nusra and fought alongside other Islamist currents such as Ahrar ash-Sham. It was inevitable that these battle-tested Islamists would overrun the peaceful protesters and the defectors from the Syrian Army — the Free Syrian Army (FSA) — who scattered to the wind in 2012.
The FSA troops either joined up with the Islamists, continued to fight in small detachments, or linger precariously as twice defectors who are now homeless. The barbarism of the ISIS pushed other Islamists — with Gulf Arab support — to form the Islamic Front. The hope was that this group would run ISIS back to Iraq and remove the stigma of “al-Qaeda” from the Syrian rebellion. The problem is that one of the constituents of the Islamic Front — Jabhat al-Nusra, arguably the most effective of its fighting forces — sees itself as the Syrian franchise of al-Qaeda and has largely abjured the fight against ISIS. Another problem is that the in-fighting on the ground seems to have tapered off — one of the Islamist groups, Suqour al-Sham signed a truce with ISIS and pledged to work together.
By early 2014, these groups found their supply lines cut off. Iraq’s attack on ISIS began to seal the porous border that runs through the Great Syrian Desert. Jordan had already tried to close its border since early 2013, having arrested over a hundred fighters who have tried to cross into Syria. Lebanon’s border has become almost inaccessible for the rebels as the Syrian Army takes the roadway that runs along the boundary line. Last year, Turkey closed the Azaz crossing once it was taken over by the radical Islamists.
On January 20, the rebels attacked the Turkish post at Cilvegözü-Bab al-Hawa, killing 16. This is what spurred the Turkish Army to attack the ISIS convoy a week later.
As the Islamists saw their supply lines closed off, the U.S. announced that it would restart its aid to the rebel fighters. On February 5, the Syrian Coalition chief Ahmad Jabra told Future TV that his rebels would get “advanced weapons” — likely from the U.S. The FSA announced the formation of the Southern Front – with assistance from the West — to revive the dormant fight in Syria’s south-west. All this took place during Geneva 2, signalling confusion in U.S. policy. Does Washington still want to overthrow the Syrian government? Would it live with an Islamist government on Israel’s borders? Or, perhaps, the U.S. is eager for a stalemate, as pointed out by former CIA analyst Bruce Riedel, “The rebels lack the organisation and weapons to defeat Assad. The regime lacks the loyal manpower to suppress the rebellion. Both sides’ external allies are ready to supply enough money and arms to fuel the stalemate for the foreseeable future.” This is a cruel strategy. It offers no hope of peace for the Syrian people.Road ahead for Syria group
A senior military official in West Asia told me that one of the most overlooked aspects of West Asia and North Africa is that the military leaderships of each country maintain close contacts with each other. During Turkey’s war against the Kurdish rebellion in its eastern provinces, the military coordinated their operations with the Syrian armed forces. These links have been maintained. When it became clear that Mr. Erdog˘an’s exaggerated hopes for Syria failed, and with the growth of the Islamists on Turkey’s borders and the Kurds in Syria having declared their independence, the Turkish military exerted its views. The Iraqi armed forces had already begun their operations against ISIS. Additionally, Egypt’s new Field Marshal Sisi overthrew the government of Mohamed Morsi when the latter encouraged jihadis to go to Syria. This was anathema to the Egyptian military who acted for this and other reasons to depose Mr. Morsi. The military view of the political situation leans naturally toward the terrorism narrative.
It appears now that the regional states are no longer agreed that their primary mission is the removal of Mr. Assad. This view — shared by the militaries — is evident in the political leadership in Iran, Iraq, and Turkey. With Egypt, these three states would be the core of a rejuvenated Syria Contact Group..
If the Syria Contact Group is to re-emerge, it would need to be incubated by pressure from China and India, two countries that are sympathetic to multipolar regionalism.
Thus far, neither China nor India has taken an active role in the Syrian conflict, content to work within the United Nations and to make statements as part of the BRICS group. But the failure of the U.S. and Russia and the paralysis of the U.N. alongside the continued brutality in Syria require an alternative path to be opened up. Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Turkey have indicated willingness for a dialogue — China and India need to offer them the table.

proxy war to its climax only betrays the volte face and self-interests
fuelling the civil war. Geneva-II talks were a witness to the same.
Without the participation of all the stakeholders including delegates
from all the rebel groups or Iran for that matter, nothing good could
or did come out of it. A permanent solution to the 3-year long crisis
can only come from a regional bloc which duly weighs the power
equations, not to forget the threat of terrorism tearing the region
apart.
This then throws up another question of whether the time of reforms in
the U.N. has finally arrived? Till then, one can rest assured that
India and China are unlikely to rise above the din. Meanwhile, it is
disturbing that the issue of democratic and economic reforms in Syria
has been put on a back burner.
Mr. Prashad makes the point that both the US and Russia have failed. I
strongly disagree. Russia did the whole world a favour by vetoing yet
another war that the US and its allies were keen on. Overall, the West
has created an intolerable situation in Syria through its support of
Islamist fundamentalists. The results of their military actions over 13
years in Iraq and Afghanistan are there for everyone to see.
There can only be a political solution to this situation, which does
not involve the Islamists. I do not believe the West will want India or
China anywhere close to this issue as it can upset their own nefarious
plans - India and China are likely to be more fair and pragmatic about
the situation, which just won;t do for the West
Truth to tell, this comprehensive article has distracted my mind from the core issue of war
and lack of peace in the Middle East for ages. It fails to mention one small item, namely
Israel. Unlike Iraq or Libya, operation "regime change" in Syria has a different motive that is
directly related to Israel. It halps the Zionist-US and allies that KSA is ambitious by itself to
enhance and enfore wahabi-power in the region, and encourages the "elimination" of shia
muslims anywhere in the vicinity, from Bahrain to Pakistan to Iraq. However, this only
strengthens the Resistance of Palestine supporters, especially Iran. With Syria being
geographically right in the thick of it all, it has to pay in blood. And all along, Israel remains
"peacefully" coy about its own nuclear arsenal and territorial expansion schemes. To my
mind, India and China should take care not to contribute to further polarisation. Instead, they
could extend some wisdom of war, nay, armegeddon as not being the answer.

Do you remember that swan dress designed by Macedonian designer Marjan Pejoski, that Björk wore at the Academy Awards ceremony in 2001? Well, if Björk reminded of a spoiled Walt Disney cartoon, the new metamorphoses in Lady Gaga’s wardrobe reminded of Terminator. The Swan Lake turned into a cemetery of cars. From nature to mechanics. Lady Gaga has always followed contemporary art closely, even if with some years’ delay. The famous meat dress designed by Franc Fernandez and created by Nicola Formichetti was a reference to Vanitas, a 1987 work by Canadian artist Jana Sterbak (when baby Gaga was only 1 year old).
Also the new “hard couture” by Miss Germanotta springs from the deep world of contemporary art. Sometimes the singer almost looks like one of John Chamberlain’s crumpled wrecks, sometimes, instead, she reminds of the visionary craziness of a great performer who became an architect, Vito Acconci. Or again she recalls the recent sculptures of another veteran, Frank Stella. Lady Gaga is a sculpture-singer. Her metamorphoses are proper performances or aesthetic mutations, more than genetic. In her style there’s something “sci-barbaric” – i.e. barbaric sci-fiction – like in Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome starring Mel Gibson and Tina Turner, or Conan the Destroyer starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and Grace Jones.
Strangely enough, these are all films that recall Sterbak’s works of the mid 80s, which seem to be the mine from which the singer extracts the richness of her identity. Lady Gaga apocalyptically moves up and down the history of art, cinema and performance. The Dadaists of Zurich’s Cabaret Voltaire come back to life with her, those that with their extreme shows pre-announced the absurdities of WWI. But you can also smell the blood of Viennese Actionism: one of its protagonists, Otto Muehl, stated in 1967 that material action was promising direct pleasure and that it satisfied more than a piece of bread. Don’t be surprised, therefore, if at next Grammy Awards Lady Gaga will arrive dressed like a “Baguette au fromage et jambon”. Great actionist of the Actionists was also Rudolf Schwarzkogler: his performances consisted of dressing like a dead fish, or a rotten chicken, or covering himself in lighted light-bulbs or in colorful unidentifiable liquids, or again being wrapped in bandages like a mummy in order to mutilate himself later on.
But from Lady Gaga we are expecting something more metallic and less organic. The butcher’s season seems to be over and seems not ready for a comeback. Gaga must definitely have Ron Athey in mind, the super-tattooed and super-pierced American performer. But she could also steal some ideas from Yang Zhichao, a Chinese performance artist that had grass planted on his back or objects implanted in his legs or on his stomach. However, we have the feeling that Lady Gaga does not want anything implanted in her body (anything of permanent, of course), not even as a joke. Her body is not a territory to conquer, it’s rather a stage on which you can set up a new scenography each time, like another video-artist, Cao Fei, who had a zoological-futuristic imagination.
However, can we forget the electric dresses with many light bulbs of different shapes and colors created by Atsuko Tanaka, Japanese artist of the mid 50s? No, we can’t forget them because one day we might find them – once changed and stylistically improved – on our Lady G. And how not to mention Matthew Barney’s cycle of films Cremaster, the most influential American artist of the late 20th century, a Lady Gaga of the world of art in his own way: with the costumes of his films you could dress an army of Gagas.
Are Gaga’s mutations only a summary of the most recent history of performance art, then? Some think so, but they’re wrong. Nowadays artists, from Cattelan to our Lady GG, don’t feel any longer the urgency of reinventing themselves from scratch in order to exist. They know that they are medium and message at the same time. They are connectors which offer images that were confined to the darkness or that were considered too élite to a wider public, at times a huge one. Few people talked about or remembered Jana Serbak before Lady Gaga appeared wearing an “evening steak”. Performance, even the derived one, sometimes helps discover things that would otherwise get lost in the collective indifference. Lady Gaga belongs to a generation of mutatis mutandis, that is to say those who build their own identity by changing things that already existed but that needed to be changed in order to continue to exist. That does not mean copying: it means putting on stage.

The nine justices denied the league a hearing that would have determined whether federal labor law protects the NFL's drug-testing program from state court scrutiny.
The court's refusal to overturn a ruling that allowed the Williamses to sue the league in Hennepin County to avoid four-game suspensions was another legal victory for the Vikings' stars in their continuing fight with the NFL.
"The Supreme Court has established once and for all that the NFL cannot ignore state laws and the protections that the state Legislature has given to all employees in Minnesota," said Peter Ginsberg, the players' New York-based attorney.
"The league cannot decide which laws to obey and which to ignore, especially those that regulate the health and safety of workers. This is a huge victory for Kevin and Pat, as well as everyone who works in the state of Minnesota."
The NFL has been unable to discipline the Williamses since they tested positive for a banned substance in the StarCaps weight-loss pills they were using.
Shortly after the two players sued the NFL in December 2008, the Food and Drug Administration recalled the over-the-counter diuretic because it was tainted with bumentanide, a potent prescription drug the NFL and Players Association classify as a masking agent for steroids.
The Williamses have never been accused of taking steroids.
After a weeklong trial last spring, Hennepin County District Judge Gary Larson concluded the NFL had violated Minnesota law by failing to notify the Williamses within three days that they had failed tests. Larson scolded the league for playing "gotcha" by failing to disclose it knew StarCaps was tainted with bumentanide three years before the Williamses were tested.
The NFL is fighting to preserve its authority to discipline players under the sport's collective bargaining agreement. The Williamses weakened that authority by using Minnesota's strict drug-testing laws to avoid punishment.
The National Hockey League, National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball and the United States Anti-Doping Agency, which tests Olympic athletes, supported the NFL's appeal to the Supreme Court. They argued the National Labor Relations Act should protect their policies from a patchwork of state drug-testing laws.
Shut down by the judiciary branch, the NFL and the other leagues now turn to Congress to pass a law that would thwart lawsuits such as the one the Williamses' filed.
In September, Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., introduced the Clean Sports Protection Act, a bill aimed to block an athlete from suing to avoid punishment if he plays in a state where drug-testing laws are less stringent than his league's policy.
"The (Supreme Court's) decision underscores the need for Senator Dorgan's proposed legislation to ensure uniform and consistent drug policies throughout the country and makes it clear that we cannot expect the courts to resolve every conflict with state law," the NFL said Monday.
"Senator Dorgan's Clean Sports Protection Act would remove the legal uncertainty created by any single court decision and permit professional sports leagues to consistently apply and enforce their collectively bargained drug testing programs."
Still, the NFL concedes there is no chance Dorgan's bill will be debated during the coming lame-duck session, and no one has stepped up to shepherd the legislation through the next Congress, which will be sworn in Jan. 4.
The issue ultimately might be resolved through collective bargaining, which should begin to heat up between the NFL and the Players Association. The two sides are hurtling toward a potential lockout when the current agreement expires March 1.
Meanwhile, Pat and Kevin Williamses have asked the Minnesota Court of Appeals to make permanent Larson's injunction blocking the NFL from punishing them. Larson's temporary injunction has allowed them to play the last two years while the case is litigated.
A hearing is scheduled for Nov. 17 in St. Paul.
The appeals court is not expected to rule before the end of the 2010 NFL season, which means the Williamses should be able to play for the rest of the season without the threat of a suspension looming over them or the Vikings.

Released: Jan 1975

The first of his trilogy of records for Warner Bros. (Refazenda was followed by Refavela and Realce), this 1975 release finds Gil effortlessly dropping some of the breeziest rock of the decade. Even the most mediocre track is elevated by Gil's opalescent voice, but there are a number of great tracks here, including "Ela," "E, Povo, E" and the minimalist "O Rouxinol." While not uniformly brilliant, Refazenda still exudes an effortless cool most musicians only dream of.IsoTek introduces Discovery range of power products from £80

We found 3 news for 'Parents who are expecting a new baby boy will frequently ask me about the risks and benefits of circumcision. While the American Academy of Pediatrics used to recommend the procedure, they have changed their policy in the past few years, given that medical evidence of the benefits of the procedure are not convincing. That being said, let me provide some tips on this controversial subject.
First, there is some ever-increasing evidence to suggest that newborn circumcision will reduce the risk of your child developing cancer of the penis or an infection of the urinary tract, and it may also decrease the risk of their acquiring HIV and other sexually-transmitted diseases. But those medical problems are very, very rare events, even in boys who are not circumcised. Thats why, on a purely medical level, circumcision is not automatically recommended in this country as the current standard of care. That may change in the future, however, as the data supporting the benefits of the procedure get stronger.
Another issue is the fact that circumcision is performed on a baby without his consent, given that he is an infant. Critics point out that the procedure is a painful one that can come with complications, such as bleeding and infection. Supporters, though, argue those complications are extremely rare, and that local anesthesia can be used to reduce the pain.
By far, the most common reasons people give for circumcision are not medical at all; its either for religious reasons or because the father had been circumcised when he was a baby. So what do I recommend to parents?
The decision is a personal one that should be decided by the family, so talk to your pediatrician and get all the facts specific to your child.
If you decide in favor of circumcision, local anesthesia can and should be given to reduce the pain. If you elect against circumcision, make sure that your child learns proper genital hygiene, to reduce the risk of infections.
Hopefully this advice begins to give you the information you need to make an informed choice when it comes to the question of circumcision for your baby boy..

OpenIDSo I’m a moron. I mean it. A complete and total dork.
My idiocy seems to come out NOT in front of fellow idiots, but around uber smart, genius type people. You know, those who intimidate the heck out of you and before whom you know ahead of time that you should just keep your mouth shut and nod “yes” and “no” appropriately…because if you do say something, the whole world will know that you are moron supreme?
That’s me every time we go to the pedi urologist. This man is brilliant. Brilliant I say. He has served as president of the American Association of Pedi Urologists and is on Fox News from time to time as an expert {the national Fox, not your little local one} and is just so darn smart and I generally become a flustered mess around him.
Case in point. I spilled an entire snack container of Cheerios in the exam room while he was giving me our son’s prognosis back in January. A million Cheerios. We both tried to ignore it. But every step the man took…
CRUNCH.
And I, in turn, would CRINGE in embarrassment. And he would say, “Mrs. ‘so and so’, you seem very distracted today.” And I would say, “Oh, no. This is just me around you. I’m generally really on top of things.” Said the idiot to the genius.
And then once he said that we would schedule another appointment in three months {June} and I counted four months ahead to July for the scheduler and the doctor overhead me and came OUT OF HIS OFFICE to correct me and say that, in fact, “March to June is really only three months, not four.”
For the love of all that is holy and reasonable, why could I not count that day? Of all people to be a dork in front of, why this man? I could go on and on with all of the stupid things we’ve done since being the parents of his patients {both of our sons have had their urologic surgeries performed by him}. But sufficed to say, our latest visit, took the cake.
Because this brilliant man said something that I didn’t see coming and wouldn’t have for a million years. After our son’s next extensive urologic surgery this July, he will be placed in a spica body cast for two weeks.
Complete immobility.
For two weeks.
During July.
In the South.
Now to be fair, I’ve learned a TON about these things over the last month.
And the biggest revelation is that I need to put my big girl panties on and stop whining about it. Because most kids who find themselves in a cast like this do so for weeeeeeeks at a time. Eeeek. 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 16 weeks. Heaven help them.
It’s just that I didn’t see it coming.
And I forgot one of the biggest rules in parenting our sweet babies with unknown beginnings…expect the unexpected.
Roll with the punches.
Keep calm and shut up around the urologist!
I must have had the dumbest look on my face when he told me his plan. Because he just looked at me with the same dumb face! But I see it now. I see the plan. I understand the whys and hows it will all play out.
Grafting the sweet tissue from his cheeks {ouch} to correct what our Gabe is lacking for normal function “down there”.
Complete immobilization to ensure that the precious graft’s blood supply stays in tact.
Spica cast and yet another urinary catheter for two weeks this July.
Nope. I didn’t see it coming at all. But really, who cares that I didn’t plan it this way? I mean, look at this beautiful boy?
He will do so well…and I get to be his mama and love him through it and eat ice cream together and crank our AC down to 65 degrees and just relish the fact that our Gabe will have completed three surgeries in a matter of seven months…and that God has met us at our point of need every step of the way.
I didn’t see it coming. But I know Who did. And I trust we will find Him faithful yet again.
Morning Kam et al – hey – we’re all idiots – at least when it comes to our kids….but we’re all a “special kind of idiot” – because it’s all about our kids…and that’s OK!!
hugs – aus and co.
If you need any tips regarding the spika cast, please e-mail me amymurphy76 (at) gmail (dot) com
My son has had the cast twice for 6 weeks each time (not in July, and not in the south, though.) If you need any tips at all, let me know!
Our daughter was in a spica cast for six weeks. It wasn’t as bad as I thought it might be although it was not fun. I wrote down some things that worked for us while she was in her cast. I thought some might be helpful for you as well.We’ve been following Visions of Trees for a while now, and it’s really great to see this nicely shot video for their single out on Moshi Moshi.

“Lonesome George,” from the Galápagos Islands in Ecuador, was the last tortoise of his species. The tortoise was found dead on Sunday morning, June 24, 2012, in his yard at the Galápagos tortoise breeding center in Puerto Ayora on the island of Santa Cruz.
George was the last tortoise of the Chelonoidis abingdonii species, and he was approximately 150 years old. He died of natural causes, since his organs began to fail due to his old age, according to the results of the emblematic animal's autopsy.
Since he was the last of his species, many attempts were made to save him; however, as Vicente Tagle León (@vichetagle) [es] explains, these attempts were not fruitful:
@vichetagle: Hubo muchos intentos por hacer reproducir al #solitariogeorge, pero ninguno funcionó. Hoy Galápagos y el mundo pierden a un símbolo!
From the moment that official sources from the Galápagos National Park confirmed the news, a series of mentions, farewells, and references to the tortoise began spreading on social networks like Facebook and Twitter as an homage to George.

Marco Chile, a Galápagos Island native, published [es] an editorial in honor of George on Facebook. Among other things, he says:
A más de uno en las islas y en el mundo entero nos ha llenado de tristeza enterarnos de la muerte de George, especialmente a quienes crecimos cerca de este quelonio que se convirtió en el ejemplo de lucha de una especie empujada a la extinción por la acción de las especies invasoras y la irresponsabilidad ó desconocimiento de los primeros colonizadores de las encantadas.
On Twitter, hashtag #solitariogeorge [es] quickly became a local trending topic in Ecuador.
The Tomebamba Voice (@tomebamba) [es], an Ecuadorian radio station, reported the following:
@tomebamba: La muerte del #SolitarioGeorge conmociona el #ecuador hay 70 tweets por segundo. pic.twitter.com/FlbyQNJ6 /via @gustavomerino
Andrés Ponce G. (@AndresPonce28) [es] remembers that George appeared in one of the old Ecuador currency bills:

While Carla Villamarin (@carlitavu) [es] writes:

On July 7, journalist Andrés L Morales A. (@AndYMoralesA) [es] shared a photo of a parade in memory of Lonesome George:
@AndYMoralesA: Marcha en recuerdo del #solitariogeorge en las calles de Pto Ayora #galapagos
The directors of the Galápagos National Park decided to honor the tortoise by constructing an interpretation center [es] named Lonesome George. Additionally, the park put forth a campaign so that those who had the chance to know George could share photos of the tortoise. An exhibit [es] of these photos took place on July 8.
On July 5, the Ministry of Heritage also began the process of declaring Lonesome George a part of Ecuador's cultural heritage.
With George's death, the number of land tortoises on the Galápagos decreases to 10. These tortoises are an endangered species, and George's death reminds us of the urgency to join forces for their preservation [es].Playing for Keeps: Little Care and Thought Put Into This One
Gerard Butler, playing George, a former soccer great now dodging bill collectors in suburban Virginia, speaks in his natural Scottish accent in the romantic comedy Playing for Keeps. The brogue is remarked upon at least three times, with one character calling it "charming" -- which it is, insofar as it distinguishes Butler here from the non-Scottish guys he played in The Ugly Truth (2009) and The Bounty Hunter (2010), rom-coms that we can now pinpoint as the opening salvos of the war on women. Although less hateful than those earlier movies, Playing for Keeps, directed by Gabriele Muccino (The Pursuit of Happyness, Seven Pounds), isn't especially kind to the ladies, either. Three-fourths of the female roles are manipulative, sad soccer moms -- of various socioeconomic and marital statuses -- written into the script (by Robbie Fox) only to try to bed recovering philanderer George, who coaches their kids and is trying to make things right with his ex-wife (Jessica Biel) and son, Lewis (Noah Lomax). That Lewis's age in one scene is given as 10 and then, shortly after, 9, gives you a sense of how much care and thought was put into this movie. Yet it's not entirely forgettable. I'll long be haunted by Dennis Quaid's manic performance as a palm-greasing dad who seems to be under the influence of bath salts -- tweaked-out acting that matches the camera movements.

In a distant corner of the universe some 3.8 billion light years away, the black hole at the centre of a galaxy unleashed a violent cosmic blast as its gravity tore a star asunder. Astronomers have enlisted three powerful telescopes – Hubble, Swift and the Chandra X-ray Observatory – to study the unusual spectacle.
Gamma-ray bursts are commonly produced by the deaths of massive stars, and they can produce flaring light shows lasting up to a few hours. But more than a week later, astronomers are still detecting the irregular glow of this blast, flashing and fading. They contend a star that strayed too close to the galaxy's central black hole may have triggered the blast. Gravity tugged more forcefully on the side of the star closest to the black hole, ripping the star apart. The debris forms a jet that shoots away from the black hole and beams gamma rays our way.
The picture above is from the Swift telescope, a specialised gamma-ray burst hunter that discovered the blast on 28 March. Swift captured X-rays from the brilliant explosion, shown in red and gold.
Well we shouldn't worry too much as this happened 3.8 billion years ago. Or should we as if we are still seeing these things that happened so long ago tells me that we are living in an existance that too has already been and gone. if you truly think about it you will realise everything has already played itself out, that is why we can see these stars that are light years away.33

>>IMAGE.The investigator spied on Mark Lewis and Charlotte Harris, as well as members of their families, to compile a “dossier” about their private lives.
Last night News International, which published the News of the World, admitted to carrying out surveillance on the two lawyers, which it described as “deeply inappropriate”.
James Murdoch, who was in his current role as executive chairman of News International at the time the surveillance took place, is likely to be asked whether he knew about it when he makes a second appearance before a committee of MPs on Thursday.
The Daily Telegraph has been told that an internal News International memo unearthed by police suggests that one of the reasons the two solicitors were targeted was because the company was trying to protect Andy Coulson, the former editor who became the Conservative Party’s head of communications.
NI executives were desperate to avoid “negative publicity” which could bring down Mr Coulson. He resigned from his Downing Street post earlier this year despite denying any knowledge of phone hacking.
In September Tom Crone, a former senior lawyer at the News of the World, confirmed he had seen a file on two of the phone hacking claimants’ lawyers which “involves their private lives”.
It has now emerged that Derek Webb, a former policeman who regularly carried out surveillance work for the News of the World, was hired by the now-defunct tabloid in early 2010 to gather evidence on Mr Lewis.
Mr Webb told the BBC he watched Mr Lewis’s ex-wife and filmed her with her daughter as they went shopping and visited a garden centre near their home in Manchester.
Mr Lewis had represented Gordon Taylor, the chief executive of the Professional Footballers’ Association, who was paid £700,000 compensation by the News of the World after it admitted his phone had been hacked.
He went on to represent several other high-profile victims, including the family of the murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler.
In January 2011 Mr Webb was reportedly hired to spy on Miss Harris to find evidence of an alleged affair with Mr Lewis, for whom she worked at the time. The allegation was entirely bogus.
Other investigators were also reportedly hired, and followed her with her two young children and obtained copies of their birth certificates.
Miss Harris was being followed at a time when she was representing the football agent Sky Andrew, whose case uncovered information that led to the sacking of the News of the World’s news editor, Ian Edmondson.
Exactly what the News of the World intended to do with the information is unclear, but emails recovered by Scotland Yard investigators suggest the newspaper was determined to stop Mr Lewis representing any other phone hacking victims.
The newspaper reportedly hired a senior barrister to assess whether it would be possible to injunct Mr Lewis on the grounds that he was privy to confidential information because of his work with Mr Taylor.
The law firm Farrer and Co wrote to Mr Lewis threatening an injunction if he took on other phone hacking clients, but did nothing when he ignored the letter.
Mr Lewis said: “To follow my teenage daughter, my youngest daughter and video her is nothing short of sick. On another level, looking at me, that’s not how you litigate, you play the ball you don’t play the man…this is Mafia-like.”
Mr Lewis is said to be considering suing the company for breach of privacy.
Miss Harris declined to comment, but Max Clifford, the publicity agent who was represented by Miss Harris when he successfully sued the News of the World for £1m, said: “I know that she will be horrified at the thought that she was spied on and followed.
“She is a young mum and it’s horrendous that this happened.
“She became a thorn in the side of News International right from the start and they were desperate to silence her as she and Mark Lewis got closer and closer to the truth about the extent of phone hacking.”
A spokesman for News International said: “News International’s enquiries have led the company to believe that Mark Lewis and Charlotte Harris were subject to surveillance.
“While surveillance is not illegal, it was clearly deeply inappropriate in these circumstances. This action was not condoned by any current executive at the company."PUBLIC RECORD

Bernardine Bryant, formerly the vice president of administrative services at Normandale Community College for 13 years, was appointed interim president of Normandale on Wednesday by the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities Board of Trustees.
Bryant, who had retired from Normandale, will become the interim president beginning July 31. She replaces President Katherine Hiyane-Brown, who is resigning to become president of Whatcom Community College in Bellingham, Wash.
"Dr. Bryant's broad experience with the system, her particular knowledge of Normandale Community College and her genuine commitment to the well-being of the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities system present her as an ideal individual for this interim position," said Chancellor James H. McCormick, who recommended the appointment.
Prior to her Normandale service, Bryant was the director of human resources for the Minnesota Community College system before it became part of the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities system. She earned a bachelor's degree from the University of Minnesota, a master's degree from Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond and a doctorate from the University of St. Thomas.
A search is underway for Hiyane-Brown's replacement. Under the Board of Trustees policy, interim presidents cannot be considered for the permanent presidency.Tagged: text strings, translate replete theme

Science
For the first time, scientists have grown stem cells using human embryos cloned from adults. The research, announced Thursday, expands the technical capabilities of cloning science, while prompting larger ethical concerns.
Scientists have created human clones in the lab before, but the latest research, published in the online edition of Cell Stem Cell, takes that feat further by using cloned embryos to produce stem cell lines. A similar experiment, announced 11 months ago, did the same thing, but involved DNA cloned from fetuses and infants, whereas the new research uses DNA from two adult men. In both cases, the cloning technique was similar to the one that produced Dolly, the famous cloned sheep, in 1996.
In the latest experiment, Robert Lanza and his colleagues from Advanced Cell Technology in Massachusetts extracted complete sets of nuclear DNA from adult skin cells and implanted them in egg cells (whose nuclei had been removed) donated by four women. They shocked the resulting, quasi-fertilized eggs, causing them to begin dividing and growing into blastocysts, early-stage embryos just a few days old.
Cloning is an especially touchy process, with a low success rate. Out of 77 eggs Lanza and his team used, only two grew to become normal, late stage blastocysts. Genetically, these tiny embryos were almost completely identical to the two adult men, ages 35 and 75, whose skin cells had been used to grow them.
After creating the clones, the researchers extracted their cells to create a reproducible stem cell line, a process that destroys the embryos. Since the resulting stem cells genetically match the male donors, in theory they would be ideal cells for treating diseases in those individuals. The researchers say their goal is cloning for medical purposes, and claim they have no interest in reproductive cloning.
However, embryonic stem cells, such as those created by the latest experiment, are controversial and morally problematic because they involve the destruction of living embryos. They’ve also been eclipsed by newer types of stem cells that don’t involve embryos. Induced pluripotent stem cells, or iPS cells, can be created using only cells from adults, and scientists generally consider them the most promising route to advanced stem cell therapies. Like cloned cells, iPS cells are genetically matched to a patient, eliminating the problem of a patient’s body rejecting the stem cell treatment.
Lanza admits that stem cell scientists are more interested in using iPS cells than cloned ones, but says cloning offers “another way to skin the cat,” according to Time. “The hope is that iPS cells work out, but for the future application of stem cell therapies to treating disease, it’s good knowing there is another way to make stem cells should we need to,” Lanza said.
The United States still has no federal ban on reproductive cloning, although some states have preemptively outlawed the practice.

By Jayme Fraser | July 27, 2014 | Updated: July 27, 2014 11:52am
After two cars nearly collided early Sunday morning, an argument escalated into a fatal shooting in a parking lot.
About 12:30 a.m., Aaron James Francis, 22, was killed in the 9600 block of Bissonnet, the parking lot of the Westwood Town Square shopping center, according to Houston Police Department spokesman Victor Senties.
He and two friends had been eating food in his parked car. As they start to drive off, a white Toyota sedan, possibly a Camry, cuts in front of them. After the near collision, the white car pulls up to the passenger side of Francis' vehicle.
"Francis gets upset," Senties said. "He exchanges words and expletives with the driver of the suspect vehicle."
A passenger in the back seat of the white car rolled down his window and fired a single shot that shattered the right front passenger window before hitting Francis.
Francis hit the gas and sped out of control, crashing into the east wall of a church, Iglesia Evangelica.
Paramedics declared Francis dead at the scene.
The driver and two passengers in the suspect vehicle – two men and one woman – fled the scene heading west on Bissonett.

The real wake up call is the realization that changes to local weather events, frequencies and severity will be far greater than the average increases in temperatures etc. While people seem to be lulled in to complacency by thinking that all that has happened so far is a 1 Deg C warming the reality of a 1 Deg C warming on average means that a lot more freak events and extreme conditions with local and continental extent as well as durations lasting weeks or months. And it will be the effects of these events which will drive the message home as can be seen this year in the USA. It is sad that it takes catastrophic events to wake people up to a message that science has repeated for decades loud and clear.
Further from The Guardian.

Stephen Harper faces revolt by scientists.
Yep, shooting the scientist messengers (firing them these days) is looking like a desperate move of the cowboy brigade running amok in Canada at the moment. With a libertarian right wing ideologue like Harper as President, who needs a Heartland Institute? Hope the Canadian people will help themselves out of this misery come the next elections and send the cowboy into the Wild West where he belongs….
There are some proposed cutbacks at NIWA too.
Mind you, when the science is settled, why do you need scientists to tell us that the human race is doomed?
We are only doomed if we throw the warnings into the wind, do nothing or pay lip service only. If we heed the warnings and start to get our act together to make this show survivable, then we will need a heck of a lot of science and technology going forward. The warning part is just the beginning, the minimization of AGW, mitigation and adaptation part is the hard bit. But silencing scientists by firing them and closing their institutions down because their warnings are inconvenient is the most idiotic reaction possible when faced by a crisis that has the potential to terminate us as a going concern. Well in a country of the ‘Canada Free Press’ a lot of idiocy must seem acceptable. Freely quoted in Mencken style: “On some great and glorious day the plain folks of the land of Canada reached their heart’s desire at last and their presidency was adorned by a downright moron…”
Mind you, all bets are on if humanity is clever enough to survive the hubris of the past century. As long as some of us allow the election of Harpers and their ilk, the odds are not good for the survival bet.

The Definition of the Alternatives is the Supreme Instrument of Power
The definition of the alternatives is the supreme instrument of power; the antagonist can rarely agree on what the issues are because power is involved in the definition. He who determines what politics is runs the country, because the definition of alternatives is the choice of conflicts, and the choice of conflicts allocates power.

Dirty Hippies, Inequality, and the Minnesota Model
The great Mark Price has a piece in the Guardian today, Wealth inequality will keep growing unless workers demand better, that gets to the heart of the problem with our broken economy’s failure to provide the security, opportunity, and basic needs we all deserve. Two points are worth mentioning. First, it’s taken as a matter of faith that conservative prescriptions for the economy are easy to understand and more left-leaning approaches are more complex. I think that’s rubbish. Read Mark here. It’s not difficult at all. If people don’t have jobs, they can’t spend, and we all suffer. If there are way more applicants then there are jobs, there’s no way out of this mess. Inequality is the problem, equality the solution. It’s not that hard. (I made the same point about Robert Reich before). He also discards the silly notion that government has been trying to fix this problem, or that the solutions are unclear.

It is nothing less than the biggest sporting event this country has to offer, the one that people make a point to watch even if they do not watch another football game – or any kind of game – all season.
That’s because the Super Bowl is more than just a football game, it is a major cultural event and huge party. I was lucky enough to secure a ticket to last year’s Super Bowl in Indianapolis, my first ever, and it was an incredible experience, a true “Bucket List” event that I’ll always remember fondly even if I never get to go again. The game itself is bigger than any other because it’s longer, people arrive quite early, and it is full of pomp and circumstance, celebrity performances and the famous half-time show. Last month the NFL announced that 16-time Grammy Award winner Beyoncé will be the featured half-time star of Super Bowl 47. But beyond even these huge elements, the game itself is just the anchor for an entire weekend of non-stop events that includes the NFL Experience, several big galas that recur every year, and the amazing Taste of the NFL, which I wrote about here.
New Orleans' famously festive French Quarter will help make attending the Super Bowl a lifelong memory for visitors. Photo:Wikipedia
New Orleans is an awesome host city. I explained in detail here at Forbes.com about why Indianapolis was such a hugely successful Super Bowl venue last year, especially compared to previous destinations such as Dallas and Phoenix, and for the same reason Indy was a hit, New Orleans it is likely to be great. From a visiting fan perspective, mid-sized cities are much better venues than huge ones, simply because the number of people the game attracts gets lost in the mix of a huge city, while it takes over smaller ones and transforms them into one big Super Bowl party. But the biggest asset for visitors is a downtown stadium where the festivities can move seamlessly from the lively parts of the city to the game and back again, something that doesn’t work when guests have to be bussed far outside the city, returning to find the party over when they finally make it back from the game. There is no bigger let down after the night of your life than piling onto a bus and being stuck in endless traffic. In contrast, New Orleans’ Super Bowl will spill right into the festive heart of the city, within walking distance – and it is the most festive of American cities to begin with.
That’s why you should go. But Super Bowl tickets are notoriously hard to come by, you say. You are right. Over 30,000 applicants vie for the roughly 500 general public seats not taken by the NFL or major sponsors. As a result, attending the Super Bowl is not cheap, but it is surprisingly easy, and if you are going to make the investment, you might as well do it right. Every year people pays hundreds or thousands of dollars for fake tickets and are turned away at the gate (tickets may look pristine but the real ones have multiple security levels and are virtually counterfeit-proof) because they skimped and did not invest just a little more. Even if your ticket is real, you still face the logistical difficulties of visiting a city that is often sold out. Plus part of the reason to go is to be part of the bigger weekend festivities, not just to get a nosebleed seat. That’s why you need QuintEvents.
Global superstar and 16-time Grammy winner Beyoncé Knowles will be the Half-time show star at the Super Bowl.
QuintEvents is the Official Hospitality Provider for NFL on Location. NFL on Location in turn is the league’s marketing arm for special events including the Pro Bowl, the NFL Draft, and the annual International NFL Game, all of which QuintEvents offers the official travel and hospitality packages for. But the Super Bowl is the biggie.
I did not use QuintEvents to attend the game last year because I already had a ticket, but I was later their guest at the Kentucky Derby, which I also wrote about extensively in these pages, so I can say from firsthand experience that the company is a sports travel packager extraordinaire. After all, there are a lot of sports travel marketing companies selling packages to events, but there are good reasons why QuintEvents has been chosen as the official provider for folks like the NFL, Churchill Downs’ own Kentucky Derby Experience, and the NBA for its All Star Game. Because I was considering using QuintEvents for the Kentucky Derby at the time, I arranged to quickly tour their facilities at Lucas Oil stadium in Indianapolis prior to the Super Bowl last year, and I was “bowled over.”
As the NFL’s right hand man, QuintEvents gets its tickets straight from the horse’s mouth, so to speak, with guaranteed authenticity and great locations. But the company is in the experience business, not the scalping business, so its packages include lots of extras: express security entrances (getting into the Super Bowl can make the airport look easy), preferred on-site parking or private shuttles from hotels, and amazing in-stadium hospitality venues. Unlike the Kentucky Derby, where you could theoretically stay in one of QuintEvents’ many first class lounges and party all day while watching on TV, the NFL frowns on empty stadium seats and requires that hospitality be limited during the actual game, so these private and very VIP venues run for three hours before – and often two to three hours after – the game. When I say VIP I mean VIP: the QuintEvents lounge at Lucas Oil Stadium was no lounge, it was an enormous ballroom for 3,000 guests, designed with a “Winter Wonderland” theme. This meant there was an actual ice skating rink with professional figure skaters set up in the center, “snow” falling from the ceiling throughout, full open bars plus roaming cocktail servers, while the ballroom was encircled with countless food stations. Roast beef? Got it. Lamb chops? Got it. Sushi? Got it. And so on. Former NFL players were on hand to sign autographs for guests, and one wall was transformed into an enormous mural of plasma screens so no one would miss a moment of pre-game entertainment or commentary.
It is no exaggeration to say that the QuintEvents private facility turned the game into a daylong party for its guests, who came early and stayed late. They also block hotel rooms and offer these, with private ground transportation, along with countless optional activities throughout Super Bowl weekend as add-ons to ticket packages. Optional buys include tickets to the highest profile parties, many with nationally or world famous musical acts, events that are very hard to get tickets to otherwise, including the Playboy, Rolling Stone, ESPN NEXT and Maxim parties held on Friday and Saturday nights before each Super Bowl. Other options include attending the NFL Hall of Fame Merlin Olsen Luncheon or even playing a round of golf at otherwise private English Turn Country Club, which long hosted the PGA Tour.
The company is basically one-stop shopping for a complete weekend of fun built around the big game, just as I detailed here at Forbes.com how they extend the Kentucky Derby from the “most exciting two minutes in sports” into a three day gala. Super Bowl XLVII will be played in New Orleans on February 3rd, 2013 and QuintEvents ticket packages start at $2,800. These include game ticket, VIP parking or shuttles, express security entrances and the ultra-luxurious hospitality lounge, plus amenities such as programs and mementos. A 3-night lodging option in the nearby French Quarter adds just $1,000 per person (double occupancy) which is probably less per night than many hotels will charge anyway.
Packages go all the way up to $7,499 for field level midfield seats, but interestingly, these top tier most expensive tickets were the first to sell out. As I write this, they still have plenty of availability including midfield seats in the first stadium level, field level seats at the 25-yard line, and field level seats in both end zones. But the fact that certain categories are beginning to sell out already might suggest that if plan to join Beyoncé in New Orleans, you shouldn’t wait much longer.

Starlite himself has decided to come out of the woodwork to drop another progressive R&B gem with the Like A Dream EP. Those wondering what the producer/songwriter has been up to in his downtime, should be directed to to the Drake track “Karaoke” off Thank Me Later, which he is credited as producing and co-writing. His first album in almost 4 years, Like A Dream is the next chapter in an extremely successful series of EPs from the NYC native.
The title track is a light, dreamy treatment of some of R&B’s better sensibilities over electronic pianos, clap happy drums and airy falsettos. Interview: DJ Deep. “Today, kids want to be more Kerri Chandler than Kerri Chandler,” says DJ Deep, his words accompanied by a gentle flutter as he leafs through his enormous record collection.
A man whose two-decade career has seen him forge a close personal and professional relationship with New Jersey’s house pioneer, he’s in a good place to judge. “Just because something sounds like Kerri Chandler doesn’t mean it’s a good idea to put it out,” he continues, “because Kerri already did it 20 years ago.” His voice lilts gently down the line from his Parisian office. He doesn’t sound upset by the sudden re-emergence of the Chicago and NY house sound he’s been obsessed with since he was 16.
Instead, he’s fascinated at its cycle. The re-emergence of tropes from dance music’s 30-year history, and the difference between inspiration and mere pastiche, is a recurring theme in our conversation. Innovation, moving forward – these have always been the central tenets in the career of DJ Deep. Tom Banham. Ennio Morricone - Official Site - News.

As ‘Twenty Years of Achtung Baby” approaches (re-issues and box sets due Oct 31st), so does ‘From the Sky Down”. When watching the trailer I can’t help but notice how U2 believes Achtung Baby is the album that put them on top of the world. And this confuses me a bit as I always considered “The Joshua Tree” as the one that really put them over the top.
I guess it’s like ‘I Still Haven’t Found What I’m Looking For’, ‘Where The Streets Have No Name’ and ‘With Or Without You’ versus ‘Mysterious Ways’, ‘Even Better Thatn The Real Thing’ and ‘One. Well, they’re both filled with a bunch of awesome songs. So I guess it doesn’t matter much. Either way, I can’t wait to watch the documentary in its entirety which airs on Showtime a few days earlier on Oct 29th.Enter the Dos Shell from Windows or Pure Dos Mode (Press the F8 key when the system starts or reboots and displays "Starting Windows").

Go Big or Go Tiny Home!
The Tiny Home movement is sweeping the nation, with folks reconsidering their priorities and going "big" by going really, really small.

These efficient designs aim to get the most out of a small space, and are great projects to build yourself.
Our latest Plan of the Week is our own take at this unique perspective on home design. Meet the Kristine!
Kristine is a cute little tiny house plan that would make a great cabin. It's got a lofted sleeping space over the kitchenette. If you have some land and are looking for a modest home design to create a place to getaway and unplug from the world, this one may just be for you!
This plan has even been designed to allow for a stackable washer/dryer combo, and has cathedral ceiling to make it feel open and spacious even with a minimal building footprint.
The sleeping loft is above the kitchenette and is tucked under the cathedral ceiling.Seriously: A Dallas Court Gets Invovled in the Sale of Liverpool FC By Rob Radcliff on October 19, 2010 Posted in Injunction It’s not every day that a Dallas district court spars with the High Court in London over the sale of the Liverpool Football Club.

This is to save money, time and worries about who is cooking what and when and why etc etc. Who am I kidding it’s a chance for me to reign my control muahahah- obviously joking… Anyways, I thought it’d be a bit of fun (or not) to share my typical grocery list with you guys. Now this is for a family of 4- one super health freak (guess who), a brother who eats a whole ton (bulking up bro!), a bf with the oddest eating patterns (burger rings and chocolate cake is not dinner darling) and a mum who eats small portions but LOVES to snack (and she loves to remind us of how little she eats ugh). I don’t buy chocolate, lollies or biscuits, but she usually finds a way to buy some during the week haha. Which I don’t mind since my binges are totally under control lately (yay) and every now and again I can add some to a creation for a special treat!
Yes, it’s even categorised haha!
Okay so here’s the essentials for every week:
- trim milk 2L- for moi
- smarter white 3L for the boys
- chobani- natural
- bananas
- lettuce
- pink lady apples
- frozen vegies- for brekkys :)
- mushrooms
- fresh bakery white bread
- burgen bread (my fav)- wholemeal and seeds for me
- tofu
- tuna in springwater x 2
- Soup x 1
- roast something (depending on what’s on special, what we feel like etc) and potatoes, sweet potato, broccoli & cucumber for roast night
- spinach
- carrots
- cucumber
- turkey slices
- free range egg cartons x 2
Then usually depending on the dinners I get the meat needed, noodles/rice, vegies, sauces etc.
Here’s a list of things I stock up on every now and again once they’ve run out:
- Macro natural pb- smooth
- Macro natural almond butter
- Brown rice
- Onions
- OJ
- Wholemeal english muffins
- Wholemeal wheat thins
- Cooking products: wholemeal flour, choc chips, self raising flour, sugar etc.
- Wholemeal pasta- penne & spaghetti
- Cruskits- rye or corn.
- quinoa.
- taco kits
- almonds
- Nutella- guess who for? Chocolate cake for dinner boy. Ps. I cannot believe just how nasty that stuff is for you, I mean I always knew it wasn’t healthy but omg I won’t even get started. Also, what’s all the fuss about? Not that great- pb and ab is where it’s at.
Okay I think I got everything covered. I guess your one step closer to knowing a little bit more about me and maybe even getting some ideas next time you grocery shop. Keep in mind that this is for four people and I don’t get to dictate everything that’s bought. Roughly, each week this comes to $180-$200, which isn’t bad for four adults.
Ps. I can’t wait to have my own place and get all the groceries I want! A few extra weird and wonderful things would surely be added, that my family would probably poke their tongue out too. When that time comes in my life that I am on my own- I’ll redo a grocery list for you :)
Oh and because I’m super lame, check out this neat little snack I had last night- are you digging my skills?
That’s right on that spoon is peanut butter and almond butter..I have a spooning gift haha!
Is your grocery list similar to mine? Are you a planner or spontaneous shopper?

Dr Gallawa seemed very nice and knowledgeable during the first visit, but that's when the pleasantness ended. The surgery was already scheduled and all arrangements were made for me to take time off work. I asked my daughter to call the office 3 weeks prior to verify if pre-op tests needs to be done. 2 hours later I get a voice mail on my phone that my surgery is canceled. They did not give me any reason for it. The employees of this office are extremely rude and disrespectful. I am in the process of filing a complaint.

THE PRESS DEMOCRAT
Santa Rosa JC won its first ever men’s swimming and diving state title Saturday, with a dominating three-day performance at the CCCAA state meet in Monterey Park.
Paced by its strong relay teams and freshman diver Nico Suissa, the undefeated SRJC men finished 194 points ahead of second place Palomar. For comparison’s sake, women’s champion Orange Coast beat runner-up Diablo Valley by three points.
Of the three-day meet’s five relays, the Bear Cub men won four and had one fourth-place finish.
SRJC swim and dive coach Jill McCormick said success in the relays is all but required for winning a state title because a relay win awards double the points of an individual win.
“If you’re winning the relay battle, you usually win the meet,” McCormick said. “We knew they were super important, and we built our entire lineup around the relays.”
Friday’s 200-yard medley relay by Sean Malley, John Bing, Trent Williams and Nolan Stimple shattered a 14-year-old state record by 2.13 seconds. That race, with a time of 1:29.99, was named performance of the meet.
“There were national records set by other kids this weekend, and they gave that award to us,” said McCormick, who was named men’s coach of the year.
The men came into Saturday with a massive 155-point lead. The Bear Cubs’ point total after two days was better than Palomar’s three-day sum.
McCormick said the huge lead was liberating.
“People tend to swim very fast when they’re mentally relaxed,” she said. “We knew with the situation we were in that no one was going to catch us. We knew we could absorb a mistake.
“I just told them, ‘We’re making history today … You guys put your heart and soul out there the first two days … so go out there and leave your mark and enjoy every minute of it.’”
The relay teams weren’t the only ones turning in record-setting performances for the Bear Cubs. Freshman diver Suissa set a state record in the 1-meter diving on Friday. Suissa, who swept the men’s diving events, was named diver of the year.
Suissa’s coach, Nolan Irwin, was selected diving coach of the year in his first full season. Irwin stepped into the job last year after the sudden death of longtime coach Tim Nobriga, who had been planning to retire at the end of last season.
“We were kind of grooming Nolan to be the head coach last year, and he just kind of jumped in in the middle of all that,” she said.
“Nolan has been (Nobriga’s) protege. … He’s a young coach, but he’s phenomenal. This year was proof of that.”
For the women, freshman Alexandria Holland, who starred at Maria Carrillo, won three events and was named women’s co-swimmer of the year. She set a school record in the 200-yard individual medley Friday.

As Wired reports, the landmark machine will be installed outside of a coffee house in downtown Vancouver, allowing members of the public to exchange their Canadian Dollars for Bitcoins, or vice versa.
Machines that exchange physical currency for Bitcoins have made quite a few appearances at industry shows and conferences, and there’s more than one company attempting to put Bitcoin ATMs in public places. The machine to be installed in Vancouver this week comes from Nevada-based Robocoin. To comply with Canadian law, the machine will check your identity using palm prints, photographs, and ID verification, and will only allow for a maximum of CAD$3,000 (around $2,700) worth of transactions per user per day.
Bitcoiniacs, the company responsible for bringing the ATM to Vancouver, has purchased five of Robocoin’s machines and hopes to launch the rest in “other locations throughout Canada” soon. Unlike the one-day-only appearance of a another ATM at a San Diego hotel, all of Bitcoiniacs’ machines are intended to be permanent.To give climbers, who began their trek uphill Thursday, a firsthand look at the crisis – one billion people worldwide have no access to clean water – the group spent several days before their climb visiting a village near Arusha, Tanzania.
"Meeting the people and community in Tanzania … has been an invaluable and eye-opening experience for me," Biel says after landing there Tuesday. "My hope is that others will be inspired to find ways that they can help; starting simply in their homes and continuing to other parts of the world. We are all in this together."
Another goal of the expedition is to provide funds for clean water programs and solutions. Joining the actors on the climb are: Alexandra Cousteau, granddaughter of iconic ocean explorer Jacques Cousteau; Elizabeth Gore, an executive with the United Nations Foundation; rapper Lupe Fiasco; Kick Kennedy, an environmentalist and granddaughter of Robert F. Kennedy, and Grammy-nominated musician Kenna, the Ethiopian-born founder of the initiative, who is leading the climb.
Fans and supporters can follow every step the climbers make at the cause's Web site. The group is posting clips, photos and Tweets. Currently, more than 2.8 million liters of water have been donated through the site.

Posted: September 17, 2008|
Lily Cole
TOP model Lily Cole has bared all for the October edition of French Playboy.
The flame-haired model, 20, who starts Cambridge University next month to read social and political science, adorns the cover of the men's magazine, while 14 pages inside are dedicated to a lengthy interview and more photographs.
Lily who was born in Torquay and raised in Paignton, South Devon, posed for the shoot inspired by French musician Serge Gainsbourg's Melody Nelson album, which featured his lover Jane Birkin.
The move is a far cry from the Marks & Spencer adverts she has also starred in, but bosses at Playboy France said all the photographs of Lily have been tastefully done.
Eric Foucher, the magazine's editor-in-chief, said what differed from other celebrity shoots and interviews was that Lily had asked her celebrity friends to carry out her interview rather than a Playboy journalist.
He said: "We thought it was an interesting request from Lily Cole so we went along with it.
"She was interviewed by her celebrity friends such as Jean-Paul Gaultier or Terry Gilliam. They all asked her questions, which was quite cool."
Mr Foucher said the photographs had been taken by Barcelona-born photographer Xevi Muntane, who Lily met in New York.
He said the theme of the shoot and article – called Sweet Lily, which took place in Paris this summer – was the Sixties.
The cover photograph shows the Storm agency model with pigtails, holding a teddy bear, wearing nothing but a pair of white socks.
He added: "She looks a bit like a Lolita. It suits her. She looks really good."
French Playboy's fashion director Alex Aikiu told the Daily Mail the shoot went well. He said: "It is a very intimate, very psychological. For us, Playboy isn't Pamela Anderson. It doesn't matter how big your boobs are – it's about what's inside the woman."Out in the Gulf of Mexico, photographer Jeff Rotman accompanied divers collecting marine organisms from the artificial reefs created by offshore oil rigs ("Medicine From the Sea"), part of a major effort to discover new pharmaceuticals. Nearly every time Rotman returned to the boat, he would gush about all the curious creatures he'd spied beneath the sea. Finally, writer Kevin Krajick could stand it no more. He borrowed flippers, a mask and a snorkel and jumped over the side. Mistake. "Great big swells kept washing saltwater into my snorkel, and I started spluttering," Krajick recalls. "Not drowning, but definitely not having fun." Never mind. Krajick has other skills. In fact, he's the only person to win a second Walter Sullivan Award for Excellence in Science Journalism. He most recently won the prestigious award, sponsored by the American Geophysical Union, for an article in our September 2003 issue, "Defusing Africa's Killer Lakes," about efforts by scientists to prevent a recurrence of the massive eruption of carbon dioxide that killed some 1,800 villagers near a lake in Cameroon in 1986. Judges called the article a "superb and engaging piece of scientific writing" that "reads like a great mystery." Hear, hear.
Tessa DeCarlo first saw the photographs of Diane Arbus in 1967, when, as a college freshman, she visited the "New Documents" show at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. Her reaction was fairly typical. "I thought her pictures of odd and unfortunate-looking people revealed a vision that was dark and even cruel," she recalls. Years later, though, after months of immersing herself in Arbus' work to write "A Fresh Look at Diane Arbus," she modified her view—somewhat. "I still see an element of cruelty in her photographs," says DeCarlo, "but also a deep tenderness, a melancholy joy." Visiting a new Arbus show at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art last year, DeCarlo recalled Metropolitan Museum of Art curator Jeff Roseheim telling her that Arbus had moved him as no other artist had done. "Once I saw the San Francisco show, I understood what he meant," she says.

Siamak Tabib (Gastroenterologist, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA) gives expert video advice on: What are the symptoms of a hiatal hernia?; What is the treatment for a hiatal hernia? and more...
What is a "hernia"?
A hernia is a defect in the musculature or the muscle wall somewhere in the digestive tract or the abdomen. When a hernia occurs, a certain portion of the intestine, stomach or any other abdominal organ, can potentially stick through this weakened portion of hernia and cause potential problems.
What is a "hiatal hernia"?
A hiatal hernia, a weakening in the breathing muscle or the diaphragm, can allow a portion of the stomach cavity to go through it and come up into the chest area. A hiatal hernia can later promote more acid reflux and cause heartburn, indigestion, or as we call it, gastroesophageal reflux disorder.
What is a "strangulated hernia"?
A “strangulated hernia” or “incarcerated hernia” is a type of hernia where a piece or loop of intestine comes through a weakened portion of the abdominal musculature and as a result blocks or cuts off the blood supply to the section of bowel, and the lack of blood means a lack of oxygen, and without oxygen the tissue has the potential of dying very quickly, causing a surgical emergency where repairs would need to be carried out to cure the strangulated hernia.
What are the symptoms of a hiatal hernia?
Symptoms of hiatal hernia generally are very similar to symptoms of acid reflux or indigestion, namely; heartburn, chest discomfort, a cough, swallowing problems on occasion, difficulty breathing with shortness of breath, a bitter or dry taste in your mouth, and overall burning or pain in the abdominal or chest cavity.
What is the treatment for a hiatal hernia?
The treatment for a hiatal hernia varies, and it really depends on the size of the hiatal hernia. Usually, when there's a small or a medium sized hernia, we treat it as if we were treating acid reflux. We decrease the amount of acid that is produced in the stomach, either by modification of the diet or by medications. These medications can be available both over-the-counter or generally by prescription. When the hernia is very large, and it is getting in the way of someone's symptoms on a daily basis, then there are surgical options available to reduce this hernia and prevent future acid reflux.HOME MLB Kansas City Royals Gear Kansas City Royals Accessories Kansas City Royals Accessories Electronics $40 to $60 (4 items) Product ID: 1751848 iPad Mini Retina Swivel case!

The city says that no formal plans for the hotel have been submitted, but developers do have their eyes on Horizon Drive and H Road.
If Hyatt does build here, it would add another 133 rooms to our area, which is something the Visitor and Convention Bureau says would ease some pressure on existing hotels.
The hotel would include a restaurant and bar, an indoor swimming pool, a gym, and two meeting rooms, if it issamantha macmillan

Poem Edited:wwwwwwwwwwww so lovely! one of the best poems about love ive ever read, as uve used some original choice of words and imagery. :) (Report) Reply! Holds tension very well until it breaks (after 10 hours of hard hitting). I enjoyed it very
much on flat shots, there the control was great. I was using this string in my Volkl PB10 Mid as a mains in a hybrid with
Kirschbaum ProLine II. Strung up at 25/23 kgs. I definitely recommend this string to people with arm issues.
From: Nio, 9/14
Comments: Not too bad of a string. Good pop and feel. They lasted two and a half sets strung at 57lbs in a Wilson
Steam 99S. Strings did move around that quite a bit. I was straightening strings after every point. Going to try the second set in
my AeroPro Drive.
From: Stephen, 10/13
Comments: Phenomenal string! Holds tension extremely well; I've played with a set for 40+ hours at least and I
don't see any difference from the day I strung it at 54lbs on my Pure Drive GT 2012. Here is the best part: I noticed that as I hit,
fibers from the balls attach to the string and I realized the steel braid flexes and sort of creates a tiny gap between it and the
polyester string, and grips the balls for some amazing spin and control. I wish I could upload a picture. This string rips the balls
apart, like plucking a bird. Phenomenal!
From: Joe, 7/13
Comments: This sting has a firm feel with good spin, but feels a little too solid for me. After hitting 2-3 days, the
stings in the mains and crosses lock together that make it more solid. I strung a full bed at 54 pounds.
From: Tong, 8/12
Comments: This string lives up to the name. Three days later, my elbow and shoulder still hurt
after using it for 30 minutes. I definitely feel it. The string play like a cheap poly. I
strung it at 55 on the pb 10. For 18 bucks, it plays nowhere close to the Power
Fiber 2. I also bought a 16g, not looking forward to it.

EZ- Pour Replacement Spout Kit 10050
Product Review (submitted on June 24, 2013):
Needed a workable nozzle to replace the abortion nozzle mandated by our ever helpful EPA. The nozzle that came with the tank is essentially worthless, slow pouring, won't easily fill modern car gas tanks and causes the very leaks it is supposed to prevent. Garbage device.
This nozzle corrects all of the problems it can. It appears to be durable enough. The EPA mandated tank still needs a vent to allow it to pour continually but that's not the fault of this product.Athletic wear giant Nike announced Friday that it is selling the Cole Haan unit to New York-based private equity firm Apax partners in a $570 million deal. The company expects the sale to be completed by early next year. Nike revealed its divestiture plan in May, by announcing that it would dispose of Cole Haan and Umbro brands to focus on its core brands.
NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) chief executive Mark Parker said that the divestment will allow NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) to focus on the product lines that have the highest potential for stronger returns. He said the company will make sure that the brands in the Nike portfolio are complementary to brand Nike. Earlier, Nike sold Umbro to Iconix Brand Group for $225 million, less than half of $565 million Nike paid to acquire the brand in 2008. Nike’s athletic footwear brands, like Flyknit and Nike+ FuelBand, have created a buzz in the market.
Analysts were expecting the private equity firm TPG to purchase Cole Haan, because Matthew Rubel, the former chief of leather shoes and bags brand Cole Haan, is now a senior adviser at TPG. But the $570 million offer price by Apax Partners seemed too high for TPG.
Apax has extensive experience in fashion and retail brands. It acquired German discount clothing chain Takko last year for $1.7 billion. Apax owns British retailer New Look Group and skiwear maker Spyder Active Sports. It also has investments in Tommy Hilfiger. To run Cole Haan, the private equity firm is bringing in Jack Boys, the former chief executive of Converse.
Cole Haan was started in Chicago over one hundred years ago by Trafton Cole and Eddie Haan. NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) acquired it in 1988 for $80 million, to expand its product lines. Cole Haan has 80 standalone stores. It generated $535 million in sales last fiscal year ending May, just 2 percent of NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE)’s total revenue of $24.35 billion. Maria Sharapova’s collections of sandals, pumps, and ballet flats are the bestselling lines of Cole Haan.The Testing and Assessment Center at the LCCC Wellington Center is a one-stop location for students in southern Lorain County.

- How to Read a Study Record
This study compares two schedules of upfront chemotherapy in HER positive breast cancer.
- Number of patients with pathological complete response [ Time Frame: at week 30 ] [ Designated as safety issue: No ]To compare the efficacy of six cycles neoadjuvant PTC plus pertuzumab preceded by either three cycles of FEC-T plus pertuzumab or three cycles of PTC plus pertuzumab in HER2 positive breast cancer
- Number of patients with grade >2 adverse events as a measure of safety and tolerability [ Time Frame: up to week 35 ] [ Designated as safety issue: Yes ]to describe the safety of the various regimens toxicity is compared between the two arms
- identify prognostic and predictive biomarkers for pCR [ Time Frame: within one year after end of treatment ] [ Designated as safety issue: No ]To identify prognostic and predictive biomarkers for pCR after neoadjuvant treatment
Detailed Description:
Upfront trastuzumab treatment is beneficial to patients with HER2 positive breast cancer. The potential synergistic cardiotoxicity of trastuzumab and anthracyclines has led to the development of non-anthracycline containing regimens, which have shown high pathologic complete response rates. Anthracyclines remain very active in HER2 positive breast cancer, however, and increasing evidence now supports safe combination of trastuzumab and epirubicin. Therefore, the addition of epirubicin to a non-anthracycline containing regimen may further improve outcome for patients with HER2 positive breast cancer.
Several reports confirmed benefit of dual HER2 blockade by adding pertuzumab to a trastuzumab containing neoadjuvant regimen. The results of the combined treatment in the Neosphere study, however, are similar to what we found in a phase II trial using a weekly paclitaxel, trastuzumab, carboplatin combination with pCR rates of approximately 44%. Adding pertuzumab to this regimen is likely to also increase the high pCR rate and to add substantial benefit to patients.
Inclusion Criteria:
- Histologically confirmed infiltrating breast cancer
- Stage II or stage III disease. Nodal status must be examined by ultrasound, fine needle aspiration, sentinel node biopsy, or FDG-PET scan.
Overexpression and/or amplification of HER2 in an invasive component of the core biopsy, according to one of the following definitions:

•HER2 gene amplification defined as >6 HER2 gene copies per nucleus by in situ hybridization.
- Age ≥18
- Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status ≤1
- Adequate bone marrow function (ANC >1.5 x 109/l, platelets >100 x 109/l)
- Adequate hepatic function (ALAT, ASAT and bilirubin <2.5 times upper limit of normal)
- Adequate renal function (creatinine clearance >50 ml/min)
- LVEF ≥50% measured by echocardiography or MUGA
- Absence of any psychological, familial, sociological, or geographical condition potentially hampering compliance with the study protocol and follow-up schedule
- Absence of any medical condition that would place the patient at unusual risk.
- Signed written informed consent
Exclusion Criteria:
- previous radiation therapy or chemotherapy
- other malignancy except carcinoma in situ, unless the other malignancy was treated ≥5 years ago with curative intent without the use of chemotherapy or radiation therapy.

German police raid homes of six men over 1944 Nazi massacre
German.
The resumption of the criminal inquiry was prompted by Berlin archivists who found new evidence about it in the files of the pre-1990 communist secret police, the Stasi.
The six suspects were identified by Stasi investigators as 18- and 19-year-olds serving in the Der Fuehrer regiment of the Waffen SS at the time.
The massacre was a reprisal against the French Resistance. France tried some of the regiment's members after the war, but West Germany said there was not enough evidence to indict the rest. Prosecutors in Dusseldorf are in charge of war-crimes issues nationally.

While in New Orleans Skipper took a trip to watch tight end Irvin Smith (6-4, 230, New Orleans, LA Brother Martin) practice and after the practice Skipper gave Smith’s head coach some good news.
“Coach Skipper the running backs coach came by school last week and after practice he told my coach that he was offering me,” Smith said. “I was told to call him that night and when I did he told me about the offer. He said that he really liked the way I practiced on Wednesday.”
Smith has talked about wanting to leave the state of Louisiana to attend college for some time now and the offer from the Gators gives him that opportunity and it’s one that Smith is taking serious.
“It was great to see a Florida coach at my school and to get an offer was great,” Smith said. “Florida has always been a great football school and has always been a school that I have watched. An offer from Florida left a big impression on me.”
Later Wednesday night an excited Smith called Skipper to talk to him more about the offer from Florida and the Florida Gators running back coach explained how the Gators could use smith.
“He just told me that he likes what I do and how that Florida could use someone like me,” Smith said. “He said I could be a good asset to the program as a tight end and he wants me to visit this summer. He said that I could play the h-back position as well as flex me out some. I like that.”
Note Dame, Florida and Miami and just a few of the schools that have offered Smith over the past few months and the Smith wants to return those offers with unofficial visits this summer.
“I plan to get down to Florida this summer,” Smith said. “I have a good bit of visits planned this summer. I think I’m going to a camp at Notre Dame and some other places. I want to take some visits this summer to kind of narrow down my list of schools.”
INSIDERS TAKE: Smith said he wants to leave the state for college and right now the talented tight end is pretty open to all schools. Florida could show Smith the need for a tight end in this class if he visits Gainesville like he says.Hi,

Photo by Gabriel Bouys/AFP/Getty Images
The Catholic Church is about three hours away from being officially pope-less. Soon-to-be pope emeritus Benedict left the Vatican for the final time this afternoon (as pope anyway, he'll be back later for the second part of his retirement). Here's CBS News with the scene on the ground in Vatican City:
Pope Benedict XVI has embarked upon his final journey as pontiff, emerging from the Apostolic Palace, walking with the help of a cane, for a short car ride to a waiting helicopter that will fly him into retirement.
CBS News correspondent Mark Phillips said the crowd outside the Palace was large, but not huge, perhaps because Benedict failed to ever garner the sort of public adoration that his predecessor Pope John Paul II did, or perhaps because those wanting to bid Benedict farewell did so the previous day at this last general audience at St. Peter's Square.
Benedict should be at Castel Gandolfo soon, if he isn't already; 8 p.m. local time (2 p.m. Eastern) marks the exact moment that his resignation officially goes into effect. At that moment the Swiss Guards who are on duty will mark the occasion by going off duty, and the rest of us will return to speculating on who the next pope will be.LG Previews Google TV At Internet Week

Most of the people who doesn’t know me for well will have one typical question in lingering in their head: “Why do you do a lot of house chores?”
House chores to me, is a daily getaway from the busy routine at work and the stress that I get from teaching. Although it is a difficult task for some, but to me doing house chores lifted up my spirit one way or another. I wash dishes, I clean tops and counters, I make beds, sweep/vacuum floors, fold laundries and take care of garbage. How can I tahan doing all these?
It gives a special sense of accomplishment.
For me, completing any house chores, provide me with the best feeling of satisfaction, which I might not get on regular basis at work. At work, there are certain tasks which are repetitive in nature, but I do not feel that the accomplishment belongs entirely to me (i.e. I don’t like sharing Haha). At home, getting the chores done and sitting there with the entire house cleaned, your entire body will tell you that “WooHoo! You’ve done it! Good Job!”. A more “personal” triumph perhaps? or Am I a clean freak? or Am I a control freak?
Chore time = Talk time.
I notice that my kids would normally come by and start talking to me as I completing the chores. I would normally ask them about their school work and things they do at school. They would also tell me things about the programme on the Tele, things they need for school or just ask me random things like our plans for the weekends. Having seen me all sweaty afterwards, they would not say anything if I started to change the TV channel from their favorite TV show. Hani and Hassan would normally hang around when I needed to hang up the laundry and they would start to tease the neighbor dogs, through the fence. They would ask me things like “How do we know that they dogs are not angry?”, “Can the dogs walk with only two feet” or “How long do they need to sleep?”.
Chore time=Spy Time
Haha…this is funny. I get to “spy” on people, while doing my “normal” daily chores. Seeing me there washing my dishes, my neighbor would never suspect that I am observing their every action. Not that there is anything “interesting” going on with my neighbor, it is just that I am there, noticing things as it happens. But my ultimate spy skill is actually to check what are the kids up. I would smile to myself when I listen at them arguing with each other over ice-cream, singing/whistling to themselves, rehearsing self-scripted dialogue to match the actions made with their toys or sharing jokes/laughter from their favorite TV shows.
It allows me to reminisce.
While doing the dishes, I could easily drown myself with memories back in the days when mum would drag (and nag) me out from my afternoon of slacking, and pass me a broom or laundry bucket so I could make myself useful. She would stand next to me through the entire chores and just telling me stuff; from list of items for grocery shopping to the tele-novella drama series that she was following. Once in a while, she would criticize the way I sweep or did the windows, although I know truth is that she wanted to make sure I’m paying attention to her.
As far as I could remember, it was mum who got me started with sweeping the floor back when I was 5 or 6 years old. She told me that “Don’t be embarrass just because you are a boy doing a girl’s job. You should be embarrass if a boy like you cannot do a girl’s job properly”. That kept me going til now…
I MISS YOU MUM. GOD BLESS HER SOUL. AL-FATIHAHI used wood for the base and then traced out my hand on it. After shaping it down I used thick coat hanger wire for finger armature and slipped washing machine fill hose filled with GOOP over them. After letting the GOOP dry I snipped out "joint" places for the finger bends and let the GOOP trapped inside cure as well.
I capped off the fingers with caps bought at ACE hardware. These caps make it so much easier to slip the glove over the fingers.
I will later add a dowel post to the end to slip inside the pvc pipe that makes up the skeleton of my mannequin.

The store will take over retail space in the shopping center which has been vacant for more than two years. A spokesperson with the company said the new store will provide local customers with a convenient option for grocery shopping, including fresh produce. It will also have a full pharmacy.
The new store, which will be about 50,000 square-feet, will offer products that are favorites among the local community as well, according to officials.
"We are pleased that Walmart is opening its newest store in Coachella. Coachella is a growing community, and I am pleased that Walmart is part of our growth here in the Coachella Valley business community,” said Tom Flavin, CEO of the Coachella Valley Economic Partnership. “This new store will create opportunity by attracting additional businesses, creating jobs, bringing more city revenues and boosting our local economy.”
The Coachella store will provide close to 65 new jobs, officials said. The first Walmart Neighborhood Market opened in 1998, and the first in California opened last year in Huntington Beach.
Officials haven't announced a date when the store will officially open, but they plan to open a hiring center three months in advance.
KESQ/CBS Local 2 News will continue to provide updates as the store gets closer to opening.Soil Drenching of Bee-Killing Chemical Should Not Be Allowed
SafeLawns Objects to New Protocols for Exotic Invasive Insects
Soil drenching of toxic pesticides should never be allowed (forestryimages.org)
The existence of exotic invasive insects presents one of the biggest dilemmas of our time. When foreign creatures like the emerald ash borer, hemlock wooly adelgid or Asian longhorned beetle begin to decimate the urban and natural forest, few known natural or organic options exist for their treatment.
Asian Longhorn Beetle
So the question becomes: Do we let the insects have their way with our forests and landscape trees, or do we fight back with synthetic chemical tools that are known to help? These tools could, potentially, buy us time and preserve tree species while more environmentally friendly alternatives of treatment are sought out and researched.
For the three aforementioned insects, which are impacting hundreds of millions of acres of U.S. forests and neighborhoods, three primary chemicals have been approved by the federal government. When the chemicals are taken up by the tree, a resistance to the insects of two to four years may be the beneficial result.
Recently, a consortium of 20 tree-care companies, scientists and chemical manufacturers signed a protocol letter indicating that they agree with the three treatment options — dinotefuran is registered for basal trunk bark or soil application, emamectin benzoate for trunk injection only, and imidacloprid for soil application or trunk injection.
The SafeLawns Foundation has arduously and somewhat reluctantly come to agree with the position that chemical treatment is necessary to preserve tree species when exotic invasive insects are involved. Simply letting trees die, or cutting trees down before they die, has dire consequences for the planet.
The ArborJet injection system
We do not, however, condone soil drenching under any circumstances. The only responsible way to apply these chemicals — all known to have toxic side effects — is through trunk injection. The process has been vastly improved in the past decade by a Boston company known as ArborJet so that the chemical stays in the tree, with no leaking, and provides up to several years of insect control.
The soil drenching issue is especially critical with imidacloprid, which is from the family of synthetic nicotine products responsible for Colony Collapse Disorder in bees. When the chemical is drenched into the soil it is taken up by all the plants in the area, as well as the groundwater. When bees pollinate the plants or drink the water, they are affected by the imidacloprid.
When the imidacloprid is injected into the tree, the chemical stays in the tree. Parts per trillion of the chemical may fall to the ground inside the leaves in the fall, but by then the bees are almost finished with pollination for the season. The fact that ANY imidacloprid winds up in the soil from the leaves is not a good outcome — since infantesimal amounts of imidacloprid are bad for bees. But at least with trunk injection the least possible amount of the product will make its way into the soil.
Widespread soil drenching, as has been proposed in certain municipalities, will have dire consequences for the bee population.
If these exotic invasive insects are a problem in your municipality, tell your elected officials that you object to soil drenching of the chemicals. We’ll be happy to supply you with more information along the way.
It should be noted, too, that one natural botanic product derived from the Indian neem tree is showing great promise as a trunk injection tool in the fight against both emerald ash borer and hemlock wooly adelgid. Early tests are showing a solid rate of control. In America, that product is branded as Azasol.

United States Soccer Federation announced today that Vancouver Whitecaps FC goalkeeper Brian Sylvestre has been called up to the United States U-20 national team for a training camp in France later this month.
Sylvestre is one of six Major League Soccer players to be selected for the camp in Vichy, France, from May 15 to 20. This will include two international friendly matches versus France’s U-20 squad on Tuesday, May 17, and Thursday, May 19.
"This is fantastic for Bryan and for the club," said Whitecaps FC head coach Teitur Thordarson. "Brian has continued to learn and has been improving well. As a young player, it’s great for him to represent his country and to play high-level matches.”
The young Americans will look to rebound after missing out on qualification for the 2011 FIFA U-20 World Cup in Colombia. Last week, it was confirmed that former USA U-20 head coach Thomas Rongen’s contract will not be renewed at the end of this year. Tab Ramos, who was an assistant coach to Rongen during the 2011 CONCACAF U-20 Championship in Guatemala, will oversee the group during the six-day training camp. He will be joined in France by USA men’s national team assistant coaches Mike Sorber and Zak Abdel.The."

General info: I use to be really into writing fan fictions, but time doesn't permit me to do it now, and I spend much more time on original things.
Mostly now, I prefer to read fan fictions by those more talented than I am.
About my stories:
Ugh, I would even go there, but I am still keeping them up so why not?
I'm With You
This is a Trunks and Pan one shot/song fic that was written in 2003. It is based around the song "I'm With You" by Avril Lavienge.
The Bet
This is an Inuyasha fiction that I started back in 2001 or 2002, I don't remember. I finished it way back then (by the end of 2003 for sure) but it was removed for its "content" in the final chapter.
So I decided to rewrite the story, and make it better, but time didn't allow me too, so I will most likely never finish it, unless overcome by some extreme mind numbing boredom.
The Legend of Zelda, Link's Awakening
This fiction was a joint effort by my best friend and myself to turn Link's Awakening into a great story. Ah, but writing with two people is harder than writing a story with one, and I cannot make myself go forward on a joint project alone.
Aside from that, if I were going to, the first two chapters would have to be completely redone as they are a bunch of horrible mess.
Ah, the things I would do if I could manage my time.
For anyone who has stopped by my page, thank you, and I am sorry for being so totally lame and boring.Alexander Borodin
(1833-1887)
Sonata in B Minor for
Cello and Piano
Quintet in F Minor for
Two Violins, Viola and Two Cellos
Quintet in C Minor for
Two Violins, Viola, Cello and Piano
Alexander Borodin's
two string quartets, completed in 1879 and 1881, are milestones in Russian
chamber music. Their importance lies as much in their influence on other
composers as in their own intrinsic excellence. Although they appear to be
Borodin's only major contribution to chamber music, they did not come into
being without antecedents. Surprising as it may seem, chamber music accounts
for a significant portion of his output, and the string quartets are late
compositions in a body of work that comprises a concerto for flute and piano
(1847, lost), four string trios (1847, lost; 1852-56, unfinished; 1855;
1850-60), a quartet for flute, oboe, viola and cello (1852-56), a string
quintet (1853-54), a sonata for cello and piano (1860), a string sextet
(1860-61, two movements lost), a piano trio (1860-61), a piano quintet (1862),
a scherzo for string quartet (1882), and a Spanish Serenade for string quartet
(1886).
In a letter dated 6
November 1884, Borodin replied to the countess Louise de Mercy-Argenteau, who
had requested a list of his compositions, that his early attempts written
before his meeting Balakirev in the late autumn of 1862 were but "péchées
de jeunesse," not worthy of consideration. Happily composers are not
always their own best critics, and the maxim is borne out especially by
Borodin's assessment of his piano quintet.
While in his teens
Borodin taught himself to play the cello, and thereafter he played in a number
of ensembles, gaining wide experience in chamber music and an intimate
acquaintance with the Western European repertoire, in general his musical training
was anything but systematic, and it is significant that he considered the study
of chamber music an important part of his largely autodidactic musical
education.
During his student
years at the Academy of Physicians in St. Petersburg, Borodin especially
enjoyed the chamber music gatherings at the home of an amateur cellist, Ivan
Cavrushkevich, where works of Boccherini, Spohr, Onslow and Gebel were often
played. Written in 1853-54 at Gavrushkevich's suggestion, Borodin's string
quintet is one of the earliest Russian chamber works of the nationalist
persuasion. Its folklike propensities may well be attributable to the influence
of Franz Xavier Gebel (1787-1843), a German-born Muscovite who incorporated
Russian folksong quotations into his rather lightweight pieces.
More significantly, in
the string quintet Borodin appears as a true successor to Glinka, whose string
quartet (1824) is the most likely source of the whirling triplets that appear
in Brodin's first variation in the second movement. That movement, like the
corresponding section of Glinka's quartet, has a folk-based character. The
choice of a minuet as the third movement is common to both works, but here
Borodin was probably emulating Alexander Alyabiev's G Major string quartet
(1825), with which there are decided similarities of melody and instrumental
disposition. The quintet is interesting not only for the provenance of its
ideas but even more so as a prototype of Borodin's later works. The six
pizzicato bars that end the first movement reappear at the end of the scherzo
in the second string quartet. The principal theme of the finale, based on the
descending minor scale, establishes a pattern that occurs again in the opening
movement of the piano quintet and repeatedly throughout Prince Igor. In the
finale a dactylic rhythmic figure that Borodin adapted from Russia folk sources
and made characteristically his own becomes increasingly prevalent in the
scores of many other Russian nationalist composers in the second half of the
nineteenth century.
Nevertheless the most
apparent influence in the string quintet is Mendelssohn's. In the first
movement the lyrical element is strong, and a Mendelssohnian mercuriality
pervades both the dramatic, descending first subject and the ascending second
theme. One cannot fail to be impressed by the fluent assuredness of the
euphonious movement, in which the only weaknesses are the seams at the
exposition and the development. Despite the presence of the two cellos, which
ordinarily would weigh the formation toward darker colours, the tone of the
quintet remains bright and clear. Borodin initially had resisted the idea of
composing a quintet, doubting his ability to handle two solo parts, i.e. first
violin and first cello, and to create a part for the cello that would be both
beautiful and idiomatic. The second movement proves those reservations
unfounded. This Russian romance with two variations achieves a fine balance of
alternating solo parts in the initial statement of the theme and skillfully
combines the two in counterpoint in the second variation. The third movement is
a rapid, rather elfin minuet with a charming, Ländler-like trio. With a
bustling rhythmic underpinning the finale again recalls Mendelssohn. In
sonata-rondo form, it begins with a descending main theme, followed by a
subsidiary idea. The second subject begins with an ascending flourish, and a
repeat of the first theme closes the exposition and begins the development.
After the two subjects are alternately developed, a slow episode in which the first
cello is prominent precedes the restatement of the themes, much as they
appeared in the exposition. A brief coda ends the quintet.
There is no evidence
that the string quintet, though written at Gavrushkevich's suggestion, was ever
played at one of his gatherings, and there is the possibility that Borodin
continued to work on it later, between 1855 and 1860. No contemporary documents
exist to determine its exact evolution. In any case the quintet was left
incomplete. Sketches indicate that the slow movement was to have had a third
variation, and if Borodin composed a coda to the finale, it was lost. The
present coda was reconstructed by the Soviet musicologist Evlakhov when the
quintet was first published in Leningrad in 1960.
Borodin had arranged
many pieces for the cello, and he brought considerable knowledge of his
instrument to his sonata. It probably dates the early summer of 1860, when he
was engaged in chemical research in Heidelberg and devoted his leisure hours to
chamber music. Unlike the string quintet, which adheres to the tonic F Minor
with only a few excursions into the relative major and tonic major, the cello
sonata (along with the contemporary, unfinished piano trio) displays a free
juxtaposition of keys that marks the work of Borodin's Heidelberg years and
must have horrified musical purists.
A violinist in an
adjoining flat often played Bach's Unaccompanied Sonata No. 1 in G
Minor, BWV 1001, and Borodin decided to compose a sonata based on a short theme
from the fugue. Transposed to the key of B Minor, it opens the sonata. The
second subject, though obviously derived from the initial theme, assumes a
Russian quality that already is typical of the composer. Twice later in this
movement – at the end of the development and again in the recapitulation – the
listener will hear a further derivation of the second subject that is
apparently the progenitor of the second subject of the second symphony's
opening movement. Other material in the sonata shows a relationship to Prince
Igor. The atmosphere of the slow movement is completely romantic, and though
Borodin chose to entitle it "Pastorale", it seems that
"Rêverie" would have been more appropriate. A more animated second
section has a decidedly Russian quality; it is followed by an unaccompanied
cadenza before the return of the poetic opening theme. The Bach motif heralds
the finale in eight maestoso bars, and the finale proper is a brilliant presto
movement in B Major.
Fragments of the
autograph – the beginning of the first movement – are preserved at the Research
Institute of Drama, Music and the Cinema in Leningrad, and additional material
is in private hands. The musicologist, violinist and composer Michael Goldstein
effected the completion from Borodin's sketches and claims authorship of about
one third of the sonata. (After a fantastic career as a child prodigy,
Goldstein perpetrated a colossal hoax by fabricating a symphony allegedly
written in 1810 by a mythical composer named Ovsianiko-Kulikovsky. The Russians
delightedly laid claim to this distinguished contemporary of Beethoven, the
symphony was published and recorded, and Russian musical history was revised.
Goldstein's public admission of his rather whimsical deception threw his career
into a rapid decline, and he emigrated in 1964.) Borodin's sketches contain all
important themes plus the entire exposition of the finale, making possible the
completion of the sonata with assurance. It was published in West Germany in
1982.
In Heidelberg Borodin
became engaged to Ekaterina Sergeyevna Protopopova, who was being treated there
for tuberculosis. Advised by her doctor to move to a warmer climate, she and
Borodin travelled to Italy in October, 1861. In Pisa Borodin secured work at
the laboratory of two well-known chemists, Lucca and Tassinari, which made an
extended stay possible. The entries from Ekaterina's diary beginning on 22 May
1862 tell of Borodin's intensive work on the C Minor Piano Quintet,
which finally reached completion on 17 July during a summer holiday at the
seaside town of Viareggio.
Without doubt
Ekaterina's influence had more than a little to do with the composition of the
piano quintet. She was a pianist and a fervant admirer of Chopin, Liszt and
above all Schumann, and she seems to have converted her husband-to-be from his
earlier adulation of Mendelssohn to her own musical taste. It is reasonable to
assume that Schumann's piano quintet, which Borodin had heard a year earlier,
inspired him. Also, Glinka's influence, which had been temporarily eclipsed by
Mendelssohn's, is once again evident in the melodies and transitions. But most
important is the original and purely personal quality that heralds Borodin's
maturity. It is the last work he composed before his epochal meeting with
Balakirev later that year and the immediate predecessor of the first symphony.
The harmonic language is still traditionally tonal, but the Russian folk
element assumes its greatest prominence yet, and the form is freer than in any
of Borodin's earlier compositions. In fact, the traditional formal scheme is
completely reversed.
The first movement is
a rondo based on two themes, the first heard immediately, the second introduced
by the solo piano. They form an a-b-a-b-a structure with development or
variation occurring in each section, closing with a brief coda based on the
second subject. A similar a-b-a-b-a design constitutes the main body of the
scherzo. The trio is built of two brief, alternating phrases, and an a-b-a-b
repetition of the scherzo proper brings the movement to a symmetrical conclusion.
A strong sense of thematic integration pervades the quintet, and that is
particularly evident in the close relationship of the trio's first phrase and
the initial theme of the first movement. Further similarities are marked in the
finale. Accounting for more than half of the quintet's total length, it is the
only movement in sonata form. The principal idea is a beautiful, somewhat
melancholy theme, infused with Russian folk spirit. Because of tonal ambiguity
analysts do not agree on what constitutes the second theme. Some classify the
warmly lyrical cello melody as a transitional passage belonging to the first
subject group, while others link it to the ensuing brief viola theme as part of
the second subject.
Though it predates
Borodin's meeting with Balakirev, the piano quintet is already close to the
aesthetic aspirations of the nationalist circle. Chamber music was a genre
Balakirev condemned, and it is significant that the first six pages of
Borodin's autograph score bear indications in all five parts for various
instruments – woodwinds, trumpet, trombone – plus occasional supplementary
orchestral voices. The quintet may have been intended ultimately as a symphony.
This existence of
string parts along with the autograph score, which remained in the Belayev
archives until 1900, when they were donated to the St. Petersburg Public
Library, indicates that the piano quintet was probably played at one of
Belayev's Friday soirees early in the 1880s. It was never performed in public
during Borodin's lifetime but received its première in St. Petersburg on 5
March 1912 in commemoration of the twenty-fifth anniversary of his death. The
Moscow première took place on 13 February 1915, and the quintet was at last
published in 1938.

Vienna chamber music competition in the same year and second prize in the

before making her début in 1974. Since then she has appeared frequently in solo

Reesing laughed at that deficit, marching the Jayhawks down the field for touchdowns on consecutive possessions. Most of the night, he dodged USF sackmaster
It seemed Reesing couldn't make a mistake -- until he did. Leavitt theorized that the worst thing that could have happened to former Kansas State co-worker
"That may have been a blessing," Leavitt said.

Leavitt asked for a timeout when the clock struck two seconds. During that timeout, Bonani stood alone.
"I kind of walked away," he said. "As a kicker, I guess it's stereotypical. I didn't want to be the only kicker who goes and actually talks to his teammates."
On the right side of USF's line, Selvie looked for rushers from the outside and from the inside. He made his block. The kick would get away. "I was praying," he said. "I was like, 'Ok, I made my block. Now it's time to watch.' It was tough watching it."
Bonani's mind remained clear until after he found himself at the bottom of a pile. "Honestly, man, I didn't think about much," he said. "I just kicked the ball. Thank God it went in."

Background: Font color:
EAGLE, SERPENT AND CAT
Albus Dumbledore sat in his study, staring out the window at the darkening sky and mulling over Severus' latest report. The Potions master's logic was irrefutable as always, but it had merely served to confirm what Dumbledore already knew. He'd never had any real doubts that Harry was still alive. Divination was a fuzzy and inexact branch of magic, and even true predictions were notoriously subject to misinterpretation -- yet Dumbledore was all but certain that this was not the way Harry Potter was going to die. As for Voldemort having him, it was the obvious explanation for why no one -- not the Ministry, not Dumbledore, not even Hedwig -- had been able to find Harry.
It was a bit puzzling, though. Voldemort had seemed quite intent on murdering Harry that night in the graveyard; Dumbledore couldn't imagine what had happened to so quickly change his mind. Even if Voldemort had at last seen through James Potter's ruse, he had other reasons for wanting Harry dead, particularly if he grasped the full implications of his having taken Harry's blood to restore himself.
The only thing Dumbledore could think might induce Voldemort to spare Harry's life was if he'd discovered something else, unique to Harry, that could somehow be used to facilitate his takeover of the magical world. According to Severus, Voldemort had learnt of his and Harry's shared wand cores several days prior to the attack. But whilst Harry's wand might be of some value to Voldemort, he certainly didn't need Harry to wield it, nor had he made any attempt to retrieve the wand itself from Arabella Figg's.
That left Voldemort's research into Harry's family history. Dumbledore had never expected anything to come of this. The Potters were an old wizarding family, but for the most part an unexceptional one. Indeed, he'd been rather pleased that Voldemort had been gulled into embarking upon such a colossal waste of his time. Had Voldemort's enquiries yielded up something of significance after all? It seemed far-fetched, but there was nothing else to account for the Dark Lord's behaviour. Clearly, Dumbledore would have to launch his own investigation of the Potter family's background ... once he'd sorted out Cornelius Fudge, that is.
Dumbledore rubbed his forehead wearily. He wasn't looking forward to that interview, but the Minister had to be headed off before he managed to cause some serious damage. The man had a positive talent for doing the worst possible thing at the worst possible time. It occurred to Dumbledore, not for the first time, that Voldemort may simply have realised that it would create infinitely more disruption and difficulty, for both Dumbledore and the Ministry of Magic, to leave Harry alive and in need of rescue, rather than dead and beyond help. And he still had no idea how Voldemort had got past the protections he'd placed on Harry and his relatives. None of the Death Eaters had been studying these types of spells, at least not to Severus' knowledge; they'd all been busy researching the Potters ...
Dumbledore felt a sudden coldness in his stomach. Was that what Voldemort had discovered? Something about Harry's family -- some inherited magic or peculiarity of the bloodline -- that acted to cancel out protective charms? It would explain why no similarly protected sites had been attacked, and why Voldemort hadn't killed Harry. If he believed that this power could be extended to break through other protections, but hadn't yet figured out how ... if he required Harry's cooperation to do so, and hadn't yet managed to obtain it ...
Dumbledore gave a shudder. He'd been trying very hard not to think about Harry's probable treatment at Voldemort's hands during his captivity. His chances of extricating Harry from the Dark Lord's clutches were extremely remote. In the eleven years of his initial rise to power, no one had ever succeeded in tracking down either Voldemort himself or any of his permanent bases. Barring unforeseen developments, Dumbledore had little hope of --
WHOOSH.
Something small and grey came pelting through the window, aimed straight at Dumbledore's face. He ducked to one side; the object bounced off the armchair's high back and landed in his beard with a flump. Dumbledore looked down. A tiny grey owl, with an even tinier white scroll held in its beak, lay on its back emitting a steady stream of muffled twitters as its minute legs kicked at the air.
With some difficulty, the owl found its feet. It tried to take off again, but whilst getting up its claws had become hopelessly ensnared in Dumbledore's long silver hair. Fluttering its wings madly, the owl rose a few inches into the air (dragging most of Dumbledore's beard along behind it), then sank back, exhausted, onto Dumbledore's lap.
The little owl gazed up at Dumbledore appealingly. Smiling to himself, Dumbledore took the scroll from its beak and performed a Disentangling Charm. Once free, the owl began rocketing around the room hooting with joy, as Fawkes regarded it benignly from his golden perch.
Dumbledore turned his attention to scroll. It was made of Muggle paper, white with blue pinstripes, and tied closed by what appeared to be a length of dental floss. He pulled off the fastening, unrolled the strip of paper and read:
Dear Dumbledore,
I think I know how Harry's been hiding.
Hermione
On a fine clear morning in early August, a handsome white-tailed eagle circled the sky above the stockbroker belt of Surrey. Such a bird would have been a remarkable sight in Britain even in the countryside, yet none of the people in the suburb below seemed to notice anything out of the ordinary. They paid no heed when the eagle dropped like an arrow into a neat Great Whinging garden and rose again with a hoarse cry of triumph, a small green snake clutched in its talons.
The eagle glided to a nearby street lamp, on which was balanced a round straw basket. It dropped its quarry into the basket's narrow mouth to join the half-dozen odd other snakes it had caught in the course of the day.
Next instant the eagle was gone and Albus Dumbledore stood floating in mid-air beside the basket. Very gently he lifted out his most recent catch, which hung limply in his hands.
'Harry?' he said.
The snake made no reply. Taking his wand from his robes, Dumbledore began poking and prodding it, muttering incantations. The snake remained as unresponsive as ever, and after several minutes Dumbledore lowered it back in the basket to rejoin its fellows.
'Getting a bit crowded in there,' Dumbledore observed.
He picked up the basket and silently vanished.
Sitting cross-legged on the fluffy pink carpet of Hermione Granger's bedroom, Dumbledore took the snakes from their basket one by one, holding them out for her great ginger cat Crookshanks to inspect. Hermione herself watched anxiously from the edge of the bed.
Crookshanks gave each snake a desultory sniff, but showed no particular interest in any of them. When they'd all been checked over, Crookshanks leapt up on the bed and onto Hermione's lap, looking up at her and purring. Hermione stroked him absent-mindedly, but continued to gaze, downcast, at the basket of snakes.
'I'm not sure Crookshanks would recognise Harry as a snake,' she said in a low, worried tone. 'I mean, he detected Wormtail, but Wormtail was an Animagus and I don't think Harry's one, and Crookshanks wasn't around any of the times he transformed ...' She went quiet for a second or two, then burst out, 'And if Harry did turn into a snake, why hasn't he changed back? Could he be stuck, do you think? Could something have gone wrong with the transformation?'
'That would be highly unlikely,' said Dumbledore. 'You said he became a serpent on four separate occasions without incident. Once the Animagus transformation is successfully established, it's quite rare for it to miscarry at a later date, and such failures in natural shape-shifters are practically unheard of.'
'Reversal spells didn't work on him,' said Hermione dully. 'If he did get stuck, we couldn't turn him back. And what if he was run over by a lorry, or eaten by something? If he's -- if he's -- dead ... if he stayed a snake, we'd never know ...'
She buried her face in her hands. Dumbledore reached up and patted her knee comfortingly.
'He could be halfway across the country by now,' Hermione said in a muffled voice. 'I should've thought of this sooner, you could've started hunting for him before he'd time to get very far ...'
'I've put the word out amongst the larger birds of prey that they are not to kill any snakes at present,' said Dumbledore soothingly. 'They'll report it to me immediately should they spot one behaving strangely. All the snakes I've captured are being kept in a safe place, whilst Professor McGonagall and I research fresh ways to reverse Transfigurations.'
'If I hadn't been so afraid of getting in trouble ...' said Hermione bitterly, 'if I'd told Professor McGonagall when we first found out Harry could change into a snake, she'd probably have already worked out how to reverse it. Or after Madam Turpin was caught ... I meant to try and convince Harry to tell someone, but Rita Skeeter'd just written that foul article about Hagrid, and with helping Harry with the Triwizard Tournament, it completely slipped my mind. It was only when you asked me if I knew how he could've stayed hidden for so long, and I remembered Rita ...'
Hermione's lips thinned into an angry line.
'Well, at least that's one thing we don't have to worry about in any more --' she said grimly, '-- her snooping around for stories.'

That would be RCS branch 1.3.0.x of the script ;-) I have two possible solutions, and both are clean and quite safe (and they also do not change the behaviour of the system one iota by default, so people who think they're useless don't have a reason to oppose them. They wouldn't even be installed in their system). 1. Call a standard script in initscriptquery IF it is installed (if [ -x...), and only return a exit status code of 1 (start daemon) if this script allows it. This is the same way the cron and anacron packages deal with each other, and it's IMHO better than solution 2 below. I have code implementing the hook for this, but it's trivial to add anyway. Packages that want to implement these local policy controls, simply provide this script. A trivial version of the local policy script only needs a /etc/ config file for it to grep for <initscript ID>. 2. Use dpkg-divert to install your own particular version of initscriptquery and plug the administrative stuff in there. This requires a sysvinit and file-rc versions of the new script. On the other hand, the only way to forbid this solution to be applied is by policy. It has zero-impact, zero traces in a system it's not installed. So as not to bug the maintainers even more, the local admin script is not able to differentiate installs of upgrades, BTW. This CAN be fixed, but it would require all calls to initscriptquery to differentiate between the two, and that would be not very nice to ask of everybody. -- "One disk to rule them all, One disk to find them.

Miamidade College Downtown Tract Draws Interest
Written by Dan Dolan on December 7, 2006
By Dan Dolan
Miami Dade College already has a few nibbles on its request for a public-private joint venture to develop 2.6 acres of prime land at its Wolfson Campus in downtown Miami, a school official said this week.
Just days after the development process began, several local and national investors contacted the nation’s largest college for details on the plan to build a commercial project and a 250,000-square-foot education facility at 520 Biscayne Blvd., the school spokesman said.
In exchange for land lease and air rights, Miami Dade College wants a developer to foot the bill for building the school’s arts center and an income-producing property, which could include retail space, condos, offices, a hotel or a parking garage, according to the school’s request for proposals.
"We’re open to different ideas," said spokesman Juan C. Mendieta. "We’re asking prospective bidders to present their vision for the project."
So far, Miami Dade College’s vision includes at least two towers more than five stories tall. One would house a 500-seat theater, a 12,500-square-foot art gallery, a 9,000-square-foot dance studio, the Miami International Film Festival, the Florida Center for Literary Arts as well as classrooms and administrative offices for its College of Cultural Affairs.
The second tower, and any other building, could contain a mix of retail, residential and commercial space, the school’s plan says. Miami Dade College would retain ownership of the land, which it bought two years ago for $24.9 million. The developer would recoup its investment through rents, though the company would have to pay real estate taxes on its portion of the project, Mr. Mendieta said.
Prospective investors have until March 16 to submit proposals. School officials will review plans, then enter into formal negotiations with a developer by the end of April. A contract will be awarded in October, according to a timeline in the school’s request for proposals.
"As a public college, we have some financial limitations," said Rolando Montoya, president of the 27,000-student Wolfson Campus. "We are lucky we already own the land. Our funds for construction are limited. That’s why we’re looking for a partner for the arts center."
The Biscayne Boulevard site, which is bounded by Northeast Second Avenue and Northeast Fifth and Sixth streets, is prime real estate, school officials said. The lot, which is currently used for surface parking, features water views and easy access to mass transit.
The school’s purchasing department is accepting proposals, but hasn’t put a price tag on the project, the spokesman said.Details: or (305) 237-7575.
