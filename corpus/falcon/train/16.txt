 tries to revive momentum for the stalling vehicle technology.
Sergio Rocha, CEO of GM Korea, gave no time frame for the launch of the new vehicles, but said they would be slightly bigger than the Spark small car and use a thoroughly new design, unlike the Spark EV which was based on an existing gasoline engine model.
GM will continue working with South Korea's LG Chem Ltd to supply batteries for its second generation of electric vehicles, which will be produced at GM's plant in Bupyeong, near Seoul, he added.
"This (next-generation electric) car has a lot of similarities with the products we produce today in Bupyeong," Rocha said in the interview, on the sidelines of the Seoul auto show.
GM Korea, which makes more than 40 percent of GM's Chevrolet-branded vehicles and specializes in developing small cars for the U.S. company, produces the Aveo, Trax, Captiva and Malibu at its Bupyeong plant.
Electric vehicles such as GM's Volt and Nissan Motor Co's Leaf are struggling to gain traction, hobbled by limited driving range, a lack of charging infrastructure and high prices.
GM Chief Executive Dan Akerson said early this month that the U.S. automaker was developing new EVs, including one with a 100-mile range and another with a 200-mile range.
GM Korea started production of its current generation of Spark EVs in Korea this month for export to the U.S. market and plans to begin selling it in South Korea and Europe in the second half of the year.
LG Chem makes the lithium-ion batteries for GM's electric vehicles, which are produced in Korea and the United States.B D Building Services nicole_cdn on 29th Oct, dmoons_93 on 3rd May,

Having met our recommended conversion specialists in BasA UFO was witnessed streaking through the sky, exploding and then crashing near Greenville, South Carolina, early Monday morning.
Residents in the upstate South Carolina town reported seeing a very bright light and heard an accompanying explosion just before 2 a.m. Other residents reported feeling the earth shake when the object crashed.
One witness Cindie Stubbs of Fountain Inn, told Fox, "I saw this big, bright light that made the sand almost sparkle. It was so bright, it scared me." Fox affiliate, Fox Carolina, amazingly caught the siting on security camera.
Police reportedly received over 30 calls from both witnesses and people who were concerned with the loud crash.
Scientists speculate it was most likely a type of meteor. "It sounds like a typical bolide," Charles St. Lucas from the astronomy department at the Roper Mountain Science Center in Greenville told Fox Carolina.
"A bolide is a meteor that comes in, heats up and this one broke apart into three or four pieces, and glowed a bright blue-white," he said.
St. Lucas also added "this was kind of a rogue object -- no way to predict it -- and that makes it even more delightful."
The UFO sighting was in Vancouver, Washington, February 20, 2011, where witnesses reported seeing purple and red flashing lights, and a flying saucer shape with green and red lights. According to reports, the unidentified object hovered for a number of minutes, darting occasionally from side-to-side.
One photo showing a red dot with a blue light trail was submitted to the media from the 2011 sighting and two videos were also taken.
A local resident, Kathy Plamondon who saw the Washington UFO, contacted The Columbian newspaper saying they were confused by the sighting.
"At first I thought it was a high firework through the tree branches," Plamondon said. "As I stepped out of my front door - facing east - to help load grandbabies in parents' car, I saw that it was not going out or falling from the air, as fireworks would."(Starkland 217)

Close to a hundred cars filled with visitors showed up for the show. On view was everything from a 1914 Model T Ford Speedster to a 1937 Cadillac Coupe Convertible.
In all there was an estimate of over three hundred people looking over the exhibition-quality, old cars that were spread out on the grounds of Hubbard Field in Essex.
Model T Speedster Up in Front
At the very front row of the show was a 1914 Model T Ford Speedster, proudly owned by Bruce Robinson of Chester, who brought along his granddaughter, Ann Lovelace, to the auto show.
Bruce Robinson and Granddaughter, Ann Lovelace, in 1914 Model T
Robinson said that he had bought the engine and chassis of the Speedster four years ago, and that he paid $40,000 for the vehicle’s renovation. The restoration was done by Ralph Herman of Essex, who specializes in making old cars look like new.
One thing that you have to careful about in driving the brilliant yellow car that he had on display is that, “The brakes do not work too good.” “You have to slow down,” before the brakes will engage, he said.
Antique Car Owner MacMillan Has a Winner
Just down the line was a 1912 Ford Model T Touring Car owned by Bruce MacMillan. MacMillan was an unsuccessful candidate for Essex First Selectman in the last town election, and, “It wasn’t even close,” he said.
As for his 1912 antique car on display, MacMillan said that 15 million of these touring cars were built by Ford. His car’s model number is 176,713 out of these 15 million built. Also, MacMillan says that he drives his car all the time around Essex, even though the car is now 101 years old.

MacMillan noted that his car had its original body and engine, and that it had an estimated worth of $50,000. Also, originally, the car had removable doors.
A 1956 Chevy Belair Auto Also on View
A V-8 powered Chevy Belair was also a star at the Antique and Classic Car Show. Owned by Ed Makrisch, he said that driving his classic vehicle, “brings back many memories.” He said that cars like these provided “basic transportation” for millions of people.

As for now, he said, these cars are restored better than they ever were, and worth more now than they ever were as well. As for the value of his car in its present pristine condition, he said it could be worth as much as $75,000 to $100,000
Terry Lomme in Charge of the Show
Terry Lomme, an Essex resident, was in charge of this year’s 6th Annual Antique and Classic Car Show, sponsored by the Essex Automobile Club. Lomme said that there was, “a very interesting variety of vehicles at this year’s show.”
The exhibited cars range he said “from a 1910 Model T, Ford Speedster to a 1971 Mercedes Benz sedan.” Lomme also noted that all of the proceeds from the auto show are being donated to the Child and Family Agency of Southeastern Connecticut.
Here Comes a Classic Cadillac!
Another star at the show, and there were many, was a 1937 Cadillac, 60 Series, Coupe Convertible, owned by Paul and Leslee Lavigne. Paul said that when they were restoring their Coupe Convertible up to its present pristine condition, his wife found all of the parts that they needed over the Internet.

Also, he said that the couple drives their Cadillac convertible to various antique auto shows, and that, “it is a lot of fun to drive.” He also stressed that these were “durable cars,” as well as “a pleasure to ride in.” Also, the car even had a rumble seat in back.
At the auto show, there were not only elegant and dependable cars on view, there were also what are called, “muscle cars.” If you are ever asked what that means, it is the name given for the high performance cars of the 1960’s.
Rubble seat of 1937 Cadillac CoupeBy Edward Douglas ON May 20, 2006 Cast: Bezu Fache Etienne Chicot as Lt. Collet Jean-Pierre Marielle as Jacques Sauniere Clive Carter as Detective Chief Inspector (Biggin Hill) Seth Gabel as Michael the Cleric Marie-Françoise Audollent as Sister Sandrine David Bark-Jones as Richard Jean-Yves Berteloot as Remy Directed by Ron Howard Summary: It’s just not that the movie is way too long and duller than watching Da Vinci’s paint dry, but it takes away any of the book’s little credibility and makes the flaws in it that much more obvious. Story: Religious symbologist Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) has been called to the Louvre in Paris to help the police with their investigation into the murder of its curator. Once he gets there, he learns that he’s the prime suspect and with the help of a police cryptographer (Neveau) and a British scholar (Ian McKellen), he must track down a sacred item that others have already killed to find. Analysis: There are only two ways to review this movie, either by comparing it to Dan Brown’s bestselling novel or by comparing it to other movie experiences. Normally, the former would be the easier route to take, but if you have an even remotely active imagination, you already have a picture in your mind about how the characters and situations depicted in the book should look. Films rarely can fully capture that sort of competition, but at least in cases like Thomas Harris’ “Hannibal,” it offers strong performances and stylish filmmaking to make up for the book’s flaws. Ron Howard’s take on Brown’s novel, adapted by Oscar winner Akiva Goldsman (“A Beautiful Mind”), offers neither. The original story involves a quest for the Holy Grail, which apparently isn’t the same chalice sought by Indiana Jones and his father, but that search quickly turns into a revisionist history lesson revealing the “true” history of the Knights Templar and the Grail. You know, the stuff they forgot to teach us in Sunday School, which conveniently ended up on the cutting room floor of “The Passion of The Christ.” The quest by Langdon and his collaborators to discover this two-thousand year old mystery has him being chased by French police and a ruthless albino agent of Opus Dei. Contrary to earlier apprehensions, the various churches don’t come across nearly as bad as the French police do, thanks to the ruthless techniques used by Jean Reno’s Bézu Fache. The problem isn’t that this movie veers away from the book, so much that it’s far too literal. The amount of talking and exposition in the book doesn’t really translate into an interesting movie, and anyone expecting anything close to a thriller will be frustrated by the surprising lack of tension, suspense or excitement. At least when you read the book, you can set it down when the religious babble gets to be too much, but sitting through two and a half hours of it is like being chained to a desk for an extended history lecture. While some may choose to believe some of the religious theories raised in the book, when it’s talked about aloud between the main characters, it comes across as ludicrous. Even when the movie tries to find new ways to tell the story, it comes up with silly ideas like Langdon using a cell phone web search to decipher the clues. If only it were that easy to find the Grail! The only time the movie ever rises above a snail pace is when someone is being hit in the face or getting shot at. Whatever you want to say about Brown as a writer, he has a way of creating vivid characters, and despite all the talk of the Grails and such, little is done to embellish the characters or make them particularly enticing. It’s sorely lacking the type of omniscient exposition that makes fiction enjoyable, leaving it to the actors’ words and actions to sell their characters. Many have questioned the choice of Hanks for the role of Langdon, so to counter that poor decision, Hanks acts as “non-Tom-Hanks-like” as possible, defeating the purpose of hiring an actor of his talents and charm to play such a key role. The only depth he brings to the character is by overplaying Langdon’s claustrophobia, something that’s barely made reference to in the book. Likewise, Audrey Tautou, the lovable star of “Amelie,” casts aside most of the sweetness and charm we’ve come to love her for, as she struggles through her English lines. About midway through, her character starts showing a bit of spunk and toughness but those moments come and go and then it’s back to the serious talking again. Really, the film’s only saving grace is Ian McKellen as the lecherous scholar Sir Leigh Teabing, who provides the movie’s only departure from all the gravitas with some light-hearted banter and one-liners. He plays the part as if his lines were written by Shakespeare himself, and it does wonders at keeping the movie from being a complete waste of time. Otherwise, the movie is a hodgepodge of subtitles and bad accents, one of the most atrocious ones coming from Paul Bettany as Opus Dei enforcer Silas. With all the languages being thrown around, it’s a surprise that anyone understands what anyone else is saying. Even worse is the liberal amount of scenery chewing, mostly by Bettany, but also by Molina and others, to try to wake the audience up. The only actor who plays things down is Hanks, which makes no sense since it just makes Langdon that much less interesting than his supporting cast. Regardless, the movie is far too long, and it wouldn’t have hurt to spend less time on the history lessons, elaborately recreated using what appears to be outtakes from “Passion” and “Kingdom of Heaven.” After the climactic face-off between Langdon, Neveu and the mysterious “Teacher” who is orchestrating all of it, we’re presented with a dull epilogue that’s an even bigger let-down. It wouldn’t be so bad if the film were cinematically interesting, but it lacks the style of other recent films, including most of Ron Howard’s. Little more than a travelogue of European landmarks, the film looks dull due to the lack of strong colors, and relies far too heavily on close-ups of the various characters. Most of the flashbacks have a grainy muted look that’s even less visually stimulating, and the whole experience is dragged down by a canned Hans Zimmer score so overbearing that you relish the silence. Having recently seen the new remake of the ’70s horror classic “The Omen” certainly didn’t help, because at least the spiritual mysteries in that one are handled in a more plausible manner than anything in “The Da Vinci Code.” A few beheadings would have done wonders at making this movie more interesting and exciting; I would start with the producers. The Bottom Line: Fans of the book may enjoy finally seeing the characters on the screen, but for the most part, the movie adds nothing new to the experience for anyone who’s read the book, and little of interest to anyone who hasn’t. Ultimately, it makes the flaws in Brown’s source material–the storytelling ones, not anything to do with the religious theories–that much more apparent. “The Da Vinci Code” may just be one of those cases of a book that doesn’t translate well onto the screen, but at least it will ensure that the lines to the Louvre will be even longer. show Comments Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

October 2008 0 Senior Caregiving (1) Alzheimer's Disease presents many challenges for the senior suffering from the disease, as well as for family members and caregivers. It is very difficult to watch someone lose their memory and their ability to communicate with loved ones. Often, the people who are closest to the senior with Alzheimer's Disease are the ones they take out their frustrations on. "Away From Her" brings Julie Christie back to the movie screen. She portrays a senior suffering from Alzheimer's Disease She and her husband of nearly 50 years are faced with making a decision for her long-term care and eventually decide it will be best for her to move to an Assisted Living community. The movie does a wonderful job of showing how difficult it is for loved ones to watch the disease progress. It is the 'long goodbye" and this movie helps provide perspective by telling the story from the perspective of family members and caregivers. Definitely rent this movie if you are caring for someone with Alzheimer's Disease - it does provide a few laughs and surprises, along with a few tears.!!FridgeBrilliance
* Due to the fact that it can alter time and history and The Red Guy had been playing around with it, the Primordial Soup from the episode, Time Machine, is the reason why there are supposedly multiple Red Guys.
* Cow's birth cow was a surrogate for Mom and Dad. This is one of those universes where humans and talking animals coexist without question (a la ''ComicStrip/GetFuzzy''); Mom and Dad are animal lovers (as are their family), so they decided to have animal children instead of human children. Chicken, they hatched from an egg, but Cow was arranged through a surrogate cow - this explains Red Guy's flashback of him delivering, "Mom's baby," even though she was out in the waiting with Dad the whole time.

** This is another case of FurryConfusion: in a bumper for Creator/CartoonNetwork, Chicken confesses to eating beef when looped into Wonder Woman's lasso of truth, not to mention Cow has been seen eating poultry before.

I used to be one of the people who didn't understand the corkage fee, or the mark up on wine. It really seemed like you were paying for nothing. After watching that table open their own wine at the end of the meal, I realized that people who are sitting drinking a bottle of wine lose track of time. As much as we might like to think otherwise, time is money, especially at a restaurant. When you pay a corkage, or the markup for wine, you are really paying for the extra time that you sit in the restaurant, and the extra time it takes for the servers, dishwashers, etc, to clean up after you.
New to New Orleans: I need tips on where to shop!
Dorignac's is a New York style old school grocery store. they make their own pastrami and corned beef, and have a solid produce selection, if not exotic.
New Orleans Rehearsal Dinner!
I was recently waiting to be sat at a restaurant, when I saw a table that was completely done eating, check paid and everything, pull a double-sized bottle of yellowtail or cavit or something similar out from under their table, and begin drinking it. The server approached them, but they basically ignored her, and continued to pour themselves from this giant bottle of wine. I waited forty five minutes for them to leave, and I was furious! In what world is this kind of behavior okay? The manager was very apologetic to me, but stopped short of kicking them out, which I guess I understand, but I still can't figure out why these people thought this was okay.
Best Saints Bar Food?
What's the best free football food in town? I have to say I have been to some amazing bar buffets, and some total clunkers.
looking for specific food items in nola
the best fried eggplant in town is at Luizza's by the track. They do not have very many veggie options, but seriously, you would be missing out if you didn't have the eggplant there.
the elusive $15 entree
It's not even that I want a cheap meal, mostly that I miss a certain style of casual GOOD dining that you can get in other cities. True bistro, for example, not New Orleans style foie gras bistro. I'd love to know about any good contemporary American, or cafe style where the food is actually good. I like fine dining, don't get me wrong, and I like dives, but as a city, it seems like we are missing mid-level decent cafes. The only restaurants in town I can think of that come close are Boucherie and Lola's. Actually, it was eating at Boucherie that made me think about how much I miss this type of dining: good food, good service, unpretentious, and (dare I say it?) FUN.
Best 'ethnic' dishes in the city?
Mona's in Midcity beats out Lebanon everytime. The other locations aren't nearly as good, though.
I feel like I eat out all the time in this city and either:a)go to fine dining and end up dropping more than $100 for 2 people, orb) go casual, but still end up spending around $25 a person.I'd like to find the kind of options you get in other big cities, restaurants where you can get delicious food, don't need a reservation, and still get out of there for $20-$30 a person, before drinks. Any suggestions? I'm tired of going to restaurants that are vaguely dirty and have a somewhat fast food air (not naming any names!) and still being charged $13 for a po-boy or some tacos. There are dives that are cheap and good, but I just want a nice mid-level dining experience, somewhere that I can eat food from scratch without breaking the bank.
Lunch with workmates...
Seriously, the Gumbo Shop is not good. If you are going French Quarter, Napoleon House has a surprising amount of vegetarian lunch items.
two vegans? There are no good fine dining options in New Orleans for vegans unless you call ahead. That given, Herbsaint is doing a great lunch these days. You might want to try Cafe Minh, I think they have some nicer vegan and vegetarian options.
Best Brunch...
Ruby Slipper, off of Canal. Laid back, casual brunch, good coffee and omelettes. I went Saturday, and they were doing two-for-one mimosas with pomegranate juice! yum! awesome service and a nice neighborhood-y vibe.
Herbsaint or Cobalt?
It doesn't seem to me that you were treated badly, just that you came to a restaurant on one of their busiest nights. Did you complain to your servers so that they had a chance to remedy the situation, or just suffer in silence and them stiff them?
My French Quarter Plan - Am I On Track?
I have to say that the aps are so good I rarely bother with the entrees. I'll go with friends and just get the whole boucherie section-it's that good. Not that there aren't awesome entrees too, but the aps really shine, and you can get out of there without spending a ton of cash.
Burgers? Go to Buffa's. 2 blocks away from Port of Call, and not a mob scene. Huge and delicious.I'd pick Herbsaint or Cochon over Cuvee. Both have reasonable lunch options.

Openbox
Okay so: Since the occasion of my upgrade to Ubuntu 10.10 last week, I have encountered unusual behaviour from
gnome-settings-daemon, the Gnome settings daemon. When it launches under Openbox, it draws a new and additional root window right over my existing Openbox/X/GDM root window. This is a Bad Thing; the new root window effectively obliterates my existing desktop; it hides my dock and any preexisting window.
I am undoubtedly bollixing the nomenclature. Whatever. A new desktop was being drawn over my old desktop. To maintain my regular desktop I had to either 1. discover the source of this behaviour and remedy it, or 2. run Openbox without
gnome-settings-daemon. All I really loaded my Gnome settings for was my desktop wallpaper and mouse/touchpad settings.
eval $(cat ~/.fehbg) loads my last chosen wallpaper, but handling my touchpad settings is a more difficult issue. Before today, I would have told you that the only effective way to disable tap-to-click and drag-to-scroll, two behaviours that I absolutely cannot abide by, would have been to change the setting in
gnome-mouse-properties and then load this up with
gnome-settings-daemon.
Enter (after half an hour on Google) synclient. synclient is a command line program that allows you to “query and modify Synaptics TouchPad driver for XOrg/XFree86 server parameters on the fly.” Unfortunately the man page is a bit muck. It tells you what synclient is capable of, without actually illustrating how to do any of these things. Another half-hour on Google gave me the necessary synclient commands, which I plugged into a startup script and relate here for your benefit:
#!/bin/bash
# Disable tap-to-click.
synclient MaxTapTime=0
# Disable vertical edge scrolling.
synclient VertEdgeScroll=0
# Disable horizontal edge scrolling.
synclient HorizEdgeScroll=0
exit 0
The upshot of this is that Openbox now loads with even less background junk, and is just that wee little bit faster on the whole.
Huzzah!

The Danville Girls ChorusFrom product liability to paperbacks:
Alumnus Peter Resnik founds Boston's Book Club for the Homeless
Peter Resnik, alumnus and senior counsel at McDermott Will & Emery, never imagined that his daily walk to work through the Boston Common would inspire a national trend. Most mornings, Resnik would pass homeless veteran, Robert Day on his walk through the park. Cordial greetings grew into conversations, until the two began discussing a shared passion: literature.
For Resnik, books offered respite from complex litigation and high-profile product liability cases. For Day, books were an escape from the isolation of homelessness.
It's easy to let the pro
bono slip, but it becomes
a very important part of
your career, especially
when you look back on
what you've done.
Book discussions soon became a daily connection for the
two men, and Resnik began sharing his latest reads with
Day.
I asked him what he had done with the first book I'd
given him, recalls Resnik.
He pointed to another
homeless man in the park and said, 'I gave it to that man.'
He soon learned that his book had been changing hands
throughout the homeless community. It was at this point
that one of the nation's first book clubs for the homeless
was born.
The two men began weekly book discussions, along with a growing group of readers from the homeless community. "The idea for the book club was to try and bring people out of isolation and give them a positive accomplishment," says Resnik.
For the past three years, the club has continued to meet every Tuesday morning in
Boston's
Church on the Hill to discuss works like The Kite Runner, Water for
Elephants, and Ralph Waldo Emerson essays.
Day and Resnik's group, today known as "The Oasis Book Club," has received national attention from The Boston Globe, Boston University's NPR affiliate, WBUR, People magazine, CBS News, and Bostonia magazine. Over the past three years, the idea has been replicated across the country: Seattle, Wash., Fort Wayne, Ind., Smyrna, Fla., New York City, and even London and Barcelona, according to Bostonia.
As the head of McDermott Will & Emery's firm-wide pharmaceutical and biotech
products liability practice, Resnik has clearly maintained a strong career focus, though he
believes in casting a wider net.
You get through a period in your career where you're so
focused on developing your practice, developing your career, it's easy to let the pro bono slip, says Resnik.
But it becomes a very important part of your career, especially when
you look back on what you've done.

By Paul Woddy
The volume of Building Information Modelling (BIM)-related rhetoric has turned many people off the subject before they have effectively begun. It will be the true mark of maturity in the industry when BIM ceases to be a subject at all, but simply a factor in everyday life. So at the risk of offering yet another opinion on BIM adoption, I would like to raise a few points for consideration.
Question: What is the shape of education in the AEC industry today?
What do we even mean by this question? Different people will interpret this in different ways, depending on their expectation of an outcome.
I spend my working life in the education arena, from 12-year-old school children working towards a GCSE in design and construction; through colleges and universities blending new technology and methodology into their existing courses; professional training centres offering software training; design practices upskilling their staff; SMEs scrabbling to understand the changing requirements; contractors maintaining their mandatory staff training. I see different challenges emerging in each of these sectors, but I also see common problems that need to be overcome.
I have recently heard several debates on whether we are ready for the UK 2016 BIM adoption deadline, and read surveys seeking to understand how widespread is the adoption of BIM methodology, but I find myself wondering if these questions are being correctly phrased to get to the hub of the issues we face?
So what are these issues? Well in my opinion, we have to settle a number of problems before we can really progress towards the utopian advantages that we have been promised.
We have a developing set of standards and protocols, which are struggling to keep pace with changes in technology and best practice
Technology without theory is only half the story
The education focus needs to shift onto clients and asset managers
Mainstream education needs to provide graduates with the skills sought by employers.
CDE? What about FGH?
There are currently eight core competencies which form the foundation of Level 2 BIM adoption. Those documents outline the various processes that must be followed if we are to comply. The development of new standards and guidance on applying the existing set are emerging in a fairly regular flow, and it is fair to say that some of the existing set will need to be adapted before we are finished.
What seems like a solid cornerstone one day is undermined by new developments the next. BS1192 Common Data Environment for instance has stood design teams in good stead for nearly a decade, but as we look to accommodate a longer data life by providing appropriate electronic information to clients and facility managers, then we will need to adapt the current model where the ultimate aim is to archive information.
On a number of occasions, I have been asked to look at exemplar models provided by a client or contractor that show how they want their BIM data to be delivered, only to find that the models are simply that: 3D models with no information what-so-ever.
This problem is endemic and is something that most surveys and industry reports fail to pick-up, not because anyone is lying, but because they do not realise that what they are delivering is not BIM.
If you ask a hundred leading architectural practices in the UK if they ‘use BIM’, you will probably get eighty-five positive responses, but for many, this means that they can use BIM-ready software (such as Revit or ArchiCAD) to produce 3D models of designs, to be used for clash-detection and drawing production.
This problem partly stems from people being taught how to use a piece of software, rather than how to adopt BIM methodology using the available software tools.
The blind leading the blind
Another factor tht exacerbates this issue is that the client looks to these practices to guide them through BIM, giving them a false impression of the purpose, in turn leading to lacklustre benefits and ambivalence towards progressing faster.
If we focus on getting the clients and the asset managers asking the right questions, and demanding deliverables which are truly fit-for-purpose in the long-term, then the designers will need to sharpen their skills and realise what they are missing.
I firmly believe that BIM will only deliver on its potential once facility managers start to embrace it, and this can only happen once they see what they can do with rich, embedded data in a federated model.
Colleges and universities have their part to play as well, by keeping pace with developments in practice and providing students, not only with the timeless principles of the core subjects, but also the practical skills which make them useful in a modern workplace. The notion that a recent graduate of architecture requires training before they can be employable is a difficult position to defend, and yet it is an all-too-common scenario.
Here at White Frog we are privileged to work with Class Of Your Own, a revolutionary not-for-profit organisation that provides secondary schools and colleges with the equivalent of GCSE and A-Level qualifications in Design, Engineering and Construction (DEC). Most importantly for the future of our industry, it opens children’s eyes to realise that there are more career options in this field than architect and brick layer.
What is most interesting about the work we do as official training partner is to see that when we describe the process of BIM, children understand immediately and do not comprehend why you would do things any differently. Their exposure to the virtual worlds of graphical computer games, and their 24-hour digital interaction through social media mean that they assume a far greater technological sophistication in the design, construction and maintenance of buildings than is the current reality.
There is a dauntingly steep learning curve if you are just starting out on this road to BIM-readiness, especially as the goalposts are still moving, but the key to being prepared in any organisation is to have a robust, long-term strategy for knowledge development.
A software training course might provide a short-term fix to an individual requirement, but if you are going to change the way in which you process information and prepare your deliverables for sustainable long-term use, then you need to fully understand the context within which the software would be used.
BIM adoption has thus far been led by designers and this has somewhat tainted the subsequent roll-out as other stakeholders have looked to feed into or out from this core of activity. The reality is that for many within the wider construction and asset management supply chain, BIM will in future, have a very different look and feel.
Before spending time and money on software and associated training, companies must understand as an organisation what it is that their information can do if prepared in the right way, and also what advances could be made if they received data from others in an ideal format.

Communication. As with all healthy relationships, amicable business dealings among vendors and resellers cannot exist without it. Unfortunately, in many cases the parties more resemble sparring partners than close friends striving to achieve a common goal.
Simply stated, the best vendor/reseller relationships require a mutual effort to learn as much as possible about each others’ operations including products, services and business models. Funny how pesky everyday business concerns have a way of preventing thiat from happening. Vendors and resellers must meet their primary responsibility of meeting customer needs all while making the extra effort to wear the other guy or gal’s shoes.
For resellers, that means demonstrating a sincere interest in a vendor’s products and its company at-large, regardless of the total number of competing vendors they work with. Along with sincerity, thoroughness is key. Making the time to learn as much as possible, even about the technical side of a vendor’s business, goes a long way toward building mutual trust and respect, two of the most basic tenets of successful relationships, professional or personal.
Both vendors and resellers should be as open and honest as possible, including sharing product ideas and plans—as early as feasible—with the judicious use of non-disclosure forms and non-compete clauses. Discussing proprietary information as early as possible, whether relating to a product rollout, strategic customer project or system implementation, forges bonds that promote cooperation and support ideally on an ongoing basis or, at the very least, for the length of a promotional campaign.
Potential partners both must understand the shared goals and objectives. That is crucial not only at the outset of a campaign or installation but also as key accomplishments and milestones are achieved. Well informed partners are more likely to provide mutual support, enthusiastically and not begrudgingly. Vendors and resellers are human, and humans like being appreciated and to know that mutual support is making a positive impact on each other’s bottom line.
In conjunction with open and frank dialogue among top executives and sales personnel in the trenches, the most successful vendor/reseller relationships also engage end users. That includes their best, longest standing customers to "sprouts" needing nurturing to grow. Without end users -- without growing demand for vendor product and reseller services -- neither channel partner can succeed. Just as vendors and resellers shouldn't independently set agendas without taking into account each others’ business models or concerns, separately engaging end users will lead nowhere and accomplish nothing.
Finally, developing and maintaining a healthy relationship requires vendors and resellers to continually ask questions of each other, and to reassess goals and objectives, policies and procedures for mutual benefit. Vendors must honestly ascertain the reason or reasons for their existing channel programs. For example, are they still valid, or have market conditions, reseller or end user requirements changed to the extent that the program itself must also change?
Vendors and resellers that work together to identify market conditions, form a united front. Together, they can create a new or modified strategy that builds strong relationships, and promotes the sharing of ideas as well as concerns. Remember, tunnel vision is one of the greatest enemies of healthy channel relationships.
Vendors depending solely on rebates, spiffs and special pricing to curry reseller favor are shortsighted, at best. The most progressive vendors recognize that steady sales leads are most valuable in forging resellers’ loyalty. Conversely, resellers, by their nature, sell products and services from a wide variety of suppliers. Those that take the time, and make the effort, to develop solid, long-lasting relationships with just a few vendors will more likely reap rewards. And that’s a true win-win.For general academics and homework support

Abstract
Background CD44 is a widely expressed adhesion molecule responsible for cell-cell, cell-matrix interaction and binds hyaluronan and other extracellular matrix and cell surface proteins. Binding of CD44 leads to immune mediated inflammation, target lysis and tumour dissemination. Except this constant membrane bound form a variety of isoforms are expressed. Soluble CD44 variant isoform 5 (sCD44v5) is associated with a high rate of cell division and is elevated in patients with erosive IgM rheumatoid factor positive Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA+).
Objectives To examine whether sCD44v5 correlates with inflammation and/or joint destruction in a long-term treatment of patients with RA.
Methods Serum levels of sCD44v5 were measured in 73 patients with RA according to the criteria of ACR treated in intervals in our department in the duration of 10 years using a commercially available ELISA-test, developed by Bender-Med-Systems-Vienna. The results of sCD44v5 were compared with Disease Activity Score (DAS), 28 Joint Count (28JC), 30 Swollen Joint Count (30SJC), Ritchie Index, Proximal Interphalangeal Score (PIP), Stoke Index, Larson Score, Steinbrocker Stage, C- Reactive- Protein (CRP), Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR), rheumatoid factor (RF) and DMARD therapy.
Results We detected elevated serum levels of sCD44v5 in 50/356 measurements, with a range from 58,4 to 312,9. The mean sCD44v5 was 42,3 ng/ml. The results showed a significant correlation with RF (mean 299,4 U/ml, p < 0,001) and a weak correlation with ESR(mean 31,9 mm HG, p < 0,03)), but no correlation with CRP (mean 21,1 mg/l), DAS (mean 3,54) and other clinical scores. Furthermore we found no significant difference of sCD44v5 with different DMARD therapies.
Conclusion In our cohort sCD44v5 does not prove to be useful as predicting factor or indicator for a long-term treatment observation. Although sCD44v5 is known to be elevated in patients with rheumatoid flare such a correlation could not be shown in our study with weak to moderate inflamed patients. Soluble CD44v5 therefore seems to be elevated only in severe inflammation.

Suspect arrested in Illinois
A Friendship man is charged with bank robbery after an investigation into the robbery of a bank in Grand Marsh, according to the Adams County Sheriff's Office.
Randy Glenn Paulson, 58, was arrested in Illinois on Thursday on a federal bank robbery charge.
A criminal complaint states Paulson entered the Grand Marsh State Bank on July 3 with a handgun which he pointed at tellers and said "This is a robbery."
After getting cash from the teller drawers, he demanded a customer's car keys. The complaint states the customer didn't respond and a teller volunteered her keys, which Paulson took and left the bank.
The FBI assisted in the investigation.

With four of seven municipalities reporting late Tuesday, Democrat Colleen M. Lachowicz was leading incumbent Sen. Thomas H. Martin, Jr., a Republican, by 1,303 votes in the race for Martin’s Senate District 25 seat.
Lachowicz had 5,880 votes to Martin’s 4,577.
“I’m hopeful and overwhelmed and just waiting for the final results,” Lachowicz said at 11 p.m. at a gathering of family members, friends, supporters and volunteers at Post Office Square in downtown Waterville.
Martin, who was at home awaiting results, could not predict the outcome, he said.
“I think it’s completely up in the air,” he said.
The district covers Albion, Benton, Clinton, Unity Township, Waterville and Winslow in Kennebec County; and Detroit and Pittsfield in Somerset County.
In Waterville, Lachowicz won 4,224 to 2,318; in Albion, Martin won 598-372; in Martin’s hometown of Benton, he won 824-579; and in Clinton, Martin won 837-705.
The race drew international attention twice in a week earlier this fall when the state Republican Party created a website and mailed out flyers criticizing Lachowicz for engaging in a fantasy online game and making “crude, vicious and violent online comments.” The Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee also called the race one of the key battlegrounds in legislative races across the country.
Lachowicz, 48, is a social worker and clinical supervisor for Kennebec Behavioral Health; Martin, 47, who has held the senate seat two years, is co-owner of Nitram Excavation & General Contractors Inc., of Benton.
Lachowicz said after the Republican attacks that she thought Mainers saw the “political stunt” as bullying and that is why she received an outpouring of support for her campaign following the controversy. She said it provided additional motivation for her and her team of supporters to keep talking with voters about issues that matter to them, such as good jobs and education.. They also cited negative comments she made about Gov. Paul LePage and others.
After a complaint filed by the Maine Republican Party, the state Ethics Commission ruled last week.
During his campaign, Martin cited jobs and the economy as the biggest issue facing Maine and vowed to continue the work he started in the senate to help better the state.
Continuing to reform business regulations and working in the education system to offer students better opportunities when they get out of high school or college are paramount, he said. Making education affordable also is important, he said.
Martin is chairman of the Inland Fisheries & Wildlife Committee and a member of the Labor, Commerce, Research and Economic Development Committee. He also is a member of both the Benton Planning Board and Benton Budget Committee.

I am still having a crash in al_set_target_bitmap on line 444 of tls.c from latest Allegro 5.2 in GIT.
It happens when I try to change my mouse pointer from one type to another in my ManyMouse program. When the mouse pointer changes size I destroy the display that the mouse pointer is using and re-create it, but when I am merely changing the icon I only re-draw the buffer. Somehow when I go to draw the new mouse pointer on my buffer, the old target bitmap is trash, and when it goes to unuse the old shader it crashes because the old shader is trash too.
So my main question is, how is it possible for the old target bitmap to be trash? When a display is destroyed, the target bitmap is unset, except on Android, but I am not on Android.
I have 4 displays. One for a screen wide transparent overlay to capture mouse input. One for a visual logger. And atm, two for mouse pointers (one for each mouse present on the system). So there is a thread for each display and there is a main thread that is controlling it all. The main thread controls when to re-create the mouse pointers and re-draw the mouse buffers, but the mouse pointers are all drawn on the screen via InvalidateRect and UpdateWindow, so they are drawn through a WM_PAINT message on the window thread that allegro controls for each display.
EditFrom looking at my code, the code that controls re-drawing the mouse image buffers is called from the window callback process of my main overlay window.
Each thread has its own drawing target. The main window has its own thread provided by allegro. That thread is re-drawing the mouse images. However, each mouse window has its own display, and therefore its own callback thread. The mouse images are stored on that display's thread.
So the question is, is it because I am re-drawing the mouse images from a different thread? Is that why the drawing target is being trashed? I am having a hard time wrapping my head around all confused by what you mean when you say that mouse pointer has a separate display... is this something I can compile and play around with?
"For in much wisdom is much grief: and he that increases knowledge increases sorrow."-Ecclesiastes 1:18[SiegeLord's Abode][Codes]:[DAllegro5]:[RustAllegro]
EDITHere's a binary if anyone wants to test and or debug this. It's built with MinGW 4.8.1 and Allegro 5.2 from my binary distros. It's a debugging build so you can use it in gdb or you can try to build it yourself. All the source files in the src folder belong to the ManyMouseHooks dll project except for RawInputMain.cpp and RawInputHandler.hpp and RawInputHandler.cpp. Those files are the source for the executable program ManyMouse.
Links :ManyMouseDistro.7z
In case anyone wants to try building ManyMouse with MinGW and Allegro 5.2 :MinGW 4.8.1 binaryAllegro 5.2 binary for MinGW 4.8.1
Yes, I can give you an invitation to the repo. Right now I am trying to adapt it to build with MSVC, but there are CodeBlocks projects for MinGW. It uses Allegro 5.2 but that is the only dependency aside from Windows.
PM me your email address and I'll invite you to the repo. It's a GIT repo on BitBucket. There are two projects. One is for the Hooks DLL, and the other is for the program, which depends on the Hooks DLL. I'll answer any questions you might have.
I'm confused by what you mean when you say that mouse pointer has a separate display... is this something I can compile and play around with?
Each mouse pointer active on the system has its own ALLEGRO_DISPLAY, as well as one for the transparent overlay that captures mouse input, and the visual logger.
It looks like I am creating the mouse image buffer on the thread that runs main. But I am trying to draw to it on the main window's callback thread. That might be the cause of a crash in FCFS mouse mode (First come first serve mouse mode, activate by pressing F) where it says it fails an assertion that !al_is_bitmap_drawing_held for some reason.
But that doesn't explain the crash in Heavy mouse mode (Key H) when I try to draw different mouse pointers (the crash I explained above).I am only trying to draw the stored mouse image to the window's buffer bitmap in preparation to draw it to the window's DIB and then from the DIB to the window.
Keys F,G, and H control the mouse mode. F is for first come first serve mouse strategy. G is for normal mouse mode. H is for heavy mouse mode, where you have to have someone help you pick something up. In case of F and H, it crashes when I try to click on something, but only intermittently. ESC quits. You might have to restart it a few times or click a few different times to get it to crash. It doesn't always do it.
To test properly you probably need at least two mice installed on your system. A trackpad counts as a mouse. USB mice work too.
Here's a full backtrace of when it crashes in Heavy mouse mode if it might help you navigate the code.
Here's the SetWindowImage function of the TransparentWindow class. I use it for the mouse pointers. It's crashing on the lines highlighted below when I try to set the backbuffer for the display. For some reason the old target bitmap and its shader are trash as I explained above.
I am sorry if this is all confusing. It confuses me too, and I wrote it. :/
I really need to completely re-factor this. It's gotten a bit out of hand.
EditSiegeLord, I'll upload an archive you can try here in a bit. PM me if you want access to the repo.
Whoops, sorry forgout about this. Bumping the thread until I have something better to say.
No problem. I'm really at my wits end right now. Not sure what is going on, but somehow something is not cleaning up the old target bitmap properly, and that's why when I try to set it the old one causes a segfault.
Also related is my msvc build. I'm trying to get a dll with ManyMouse built with MSVC but I can't get it to work right.
See here : (EDIT - I solved this problem - I needed ALLEGRO_NO_MAGIC_MAIN to be defined before including Allegro).
EditYou may have to run the program multiple times to get it to crash. In FCFS mouse mode, just click the mouse and move it. In Heavy mouse mode, click one mouse and then move it, and then move the other mouse near it and click with that mouse. That should be enough to get it to crash. Sometimes it works though.
I played around with this a bit, and here's what I noticed. The crash seems always to be because the 'old_display' variable points to the display you just destroyed. Perhaps all you need to do is make sure to do the display destruction in your mouse callback thread.
Okay, so here's how it's all set up.
The main thread creates the transparent overlay window for capturing mouse input, as well as the visual logging display window. This thread is also responsible for changing mouse states in it's InputLoop function. This calls SetImage on the mice windows, which controls creation and destruction of mouse windows.
The main display has a callback function associated with it, which runs on Allegro's thread for the transparent overlay window's thread process. This thread handles all window input in the form of windows messages, including the WM_INPUT message, which triggers the transition of mouse states within each mouse mode.
So right now there are two threads controlling the mouse images. One, from InputLoop which controls mouse mode, and the WindowProcCallback, which controls transition of mouse states within each mouse mode.
So somehow I need to move one or the other into the other thread, right? I assume I need to keep everything on the same thread to prevent issues with TLS states getting messed up. I think that's what the problem is anyway.
Advice? Should I move input handling out of main and the InputLoop into the WindowProcCallback, or should I move the mouse state transitions out of WindowProcCallback into the main thread? I think I favor the first option somehow.
Yeah, the first option is what I'd suggest. If you keep everything that deals with the associated displays and images into the WindowsProcCallback thread, everything should be fine. You could move the event handling in that thread, or use some signalling mechanism from the main thread to the callback thread.
I moved the mouse display creation and destruction to the callback thread, but there is still the same crash when a display is destroyed.
I am trying to narrow it down and make a simple example program to show the behavior.
EDITI double checked a few things and I found the issue, but I'm not sure why it was causing it.
In the drawing section of the main thread in the function InputLoop I was calling mouse_controller.Draw(), which sets the target bitmap to the backbuffer of the mouse display (I don't know why I did that, because mouse drawing is handled by calling SendMessage(WM_PAINT) to the mouse window's callback thread, but I did).
So by commenting out the following line in Mouse::Draw, I got it to stop crashing.
MMDECLSPEC void Mouse::Draw() {
if (!transparent_window.GetAllegroDisplay()) {
ManyMouse::log.Log("Mouse::Draw - transparent window's display is NULL.\n");
return;
}
/// We don't paint the allegro display directly. We draw to the DIB and then use Windows to post WM_PAINT asynchronously
/// al_set_target_backbuffer(transparent_window.GetAllegroDisplay());
transparent_window.PaintTheWindow();
}
Maybe Allegro doesn't like having a display created on a different thread be current for another calling thread.
So that solved that problem at least. There still remains an difficult to reproduce deadlock issue, and an intermittent crash on close, but for the most part the program generally works now.
It should work, but can be tricky. The rule is basically that only one thread can use a display at a time. So if whatever you do ends up making two different threads access the same display at the same time then it will crash. So maybe when you make your "transparent_window" the target bitmap, it is still the target bitmap on another thread?
Keeping each display to a single thread as you said is the easiest way to avoid this issue.

The anniversary celebration, traditionally celebrated on October every year since 1979, draws millions of participants who experienced the wonderful works of the Holy Spirit as they praised and worshipped Lord God and listened to His Word as a sign of penance and thanksgiving for favors received.
On October 5, 1978, Bro. Eddie C. Villanueva invited his listeners for a Thanksgiving Mass and and Worship and Healing Prayer Rally that was held at the Polytechnic University of the Philippines Santa Mesa Campus on the Thursday nearest his birthday, October 6. About one thousand people attended the affair and experienced the miracle-working power of God!
Encouraged by the success of the rally, Bro. Eddie scheduled a monthly Strata 2000 Building, F. Ortigas Jr. Ave., “Jesus the Healer” and the Mass and DZNN Radio Veritas and the Mass and Healing Rallies. And so, he had to continue shelling out funds from his own personal earnings. For him, though, it was a great enough blessing from Jesus is Lord that his radio listeners came to know Jesus Christ as Lord and Saviour and were receiving answers to their prayer-requests.
From 1983 Jesus Christ our Lord. With the emergence of the chapters abroad, the corporate name registered with the SEC El Shaddai servant-leader Bro. Mike Velarde and Jesus is Lord Church Worldwide founder and spiritual director Bro. Eddie at the DWRV Compound in Pasig City, about five thousand people witnessed and experienced the miracle touch of Jesus is Lord.
Some eight thousand people gathered together on the Second Anniversary of the Jesus is Lord Church Worldwide at the Philippine International Convention Center (PICC) on October 12, 1980. Even the seemingly indifferent PICC staff were surprised because the affair lasted one whole day and it was the first time that its Reception and Plenary Halls were filled to capacity.
The Third Anniversary of the Jesus is Lord Fellowship was celebrated with an Overnight Mass and 7, 1989, members and followers of the Jesus is Lord Fellowship began trooping to the Rizal Memorial Football Stadium in Vito Cruz, Manila to participate in its Eleventh Anniversary. By midnight, the entire stadium was jammed with over half a million people from all over the Philippines to take part in an overnight activity of praise and worship dedicated to Jesus Christ. Bishop Teodoro C. Bacani, together with some priests from the different parishes in the Archdiocese of Manila, led the Holy Mass.
From October 13 to 14, 1990, the Twelfth Anniversary of the Jesus is Lord Fellowship was held at the Quirino Grandstand in Rizal Park, Manila. In attendance were housands of its members and followers, who experienced the wonderful works of the Holy Spirit as they praised and worshipped to Jesus and listened to His Word despite a storm which flooded some parts of the venue with knee-deep water.
On the occasion of the Fourteenth Anniversary of the Foundation held at the Quirino Grandstand in Rizal Park, Manila, from August 22-23, 1992, more than one-and-a-half million prayer-partners attended the affair. His Excellency, President Fidel V. Ramos, gave his greetings to the congregation.
Last year, two days after the UAAP Season 75 Basketball Finals between the Ateneo Blue Eagles versus UST Growling Tigers at Smart Araneta Coliseum on October 11, 2012, at least nine million participants participated in the 34th Anniversary Celebration of Jesus is Lord Church Worldwide, with no less than the President of the Republic of the Philippines, Benigno S. Aquino III as guest-of-honor in the celebration, traversing a crowd from the 61-hectare Rizal Park to Port Area to the Quiapo church in a celebration that lasted twenty-four hours from 9:00 a.m. of Sunday, October 14, 2012 to 9:30 a.m. of Monday, October 15, 2012.
TESDA Chief Emmanuel Joel Villanueva said the movement has begun its preparations for this year’s festivities.
On Wednesday, Jesus is Lord Church’s Fiesta Committee met with the Metro Manila Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council led by Metropolitan Manila Development Authority Chair Francis Tolentino to discuss plans on how to manage security, emergency traffic and crowd control during the event, would feature the the thank-offering salo-salo simultaneously from the Quirino Grandstand at the Rizal Park to the Port Area to the Plaza Miranda in Quiapo, Manila.
Early in the afternoon, the crowd jubilantly caught with their umbrellas inverted thousands of miracle-souvenir handkerchiefs thrown into the air from several helicopters. A thanksgiving prayer was offered by Bro. Eddie Villanueva for his birthday and for the anniversary of the Jesus is Lord Church Worldwide. He also led the congregation in prayer for their prayer-requests, which were tied to balloons and released to the air at the signal of Bro. Eddie.
In the 2013 celebration last October 27, 2013, His Excellency, President Benigno S. Aquino III, the guest of honor in the occasion, gave his greetings and message to the crowd. The President was with the Aquino Family. In attendance also were some members of the cabinet; several senators led by Senate President Franklin Drilon; several congressmen led by House Speaker Feliciano Belmonte Jr.; and friends of Bro. Mike Velarde of El Shaddai from the business, entertainment, media, legal, and religious sector.
Other personalities were spotted such as: Philippine STAR columnists RJ Ledesma, Stephanie Zubiri-Crespi, and Tim Yap, Tony Aquino, president of Ayala Land, Rowena Tomeldan, Ayala Land vice president and head of operations and support services commercial business group, along with their partners for the event, Millet Mananquil, Philippine STAR lifestyle section editor, celebrities Enchong Dee, Liezel Martinez, Rachel Alejandro and Joanna Ampil.
A Thanksgiving Mass was led by Pope Francis I, the Bishop of Rome and the leader of the worldwide Catholic Church together with His Eminence Gaudencio Rosales, Archbishop-Emeritus of Manila, Luis Antonio Cardinal Tagle, Archbishop of Manila; Jose S. Palma, Archbishop of Cebu, Ricardo Cardinal Vidal, Archbishop-Emeritus of Cebu, Very Rev. Msgrs. Mariano T. Balbago Jr. of Antipolo Diocese and Mario A. Castillo; and Rev. Fr. Anton Pascual and Rev. Fr. Sanny de Claro, spiritual directors of the El Shaddai DWXI Prayer Partners Foundation International. Joining them also were several spiritual directors from the international chapters of the El Shaddai DWXI Prayer Partners Foundation namely Reverend Fathers Bernard J. Nolan of Brisbane, Australia; Leo E. Steinbock of Los Angeles, California, U.S.A.;.
Meanwhile, environmentalists and community leaders around Quiapo area are calling for a “green” celebration of the anniversary of Jesus is Lord Church Worldwide.
Local leaders and the environmental network Ecowaste Coalition urged devotees and visitors to couple their devotion to the Jesus Christ our Lord Savior with respect for the environment.
The call came as participants leading to the annual celebration on October every year since 1979.
“Combining our people’s amazing devotion to the Jesus Christ our Lord with action respecting, nurturing and defending Mother Earth will be a powerful force of hope and deliverance against those who trash and ruin the environment,” Tin Vergara, Zero Waste Campaigner of the EcoWaste Coalition, said.
“If the millions of devotees who come to Rizal Park and Quiapo will simply not litter and avoid waste in all its forms, we’ll have a feast that is pleasing to the eyes and pleasing to the Lord,” she added.
Past celebrations in 35 years have seen truckloads of garbage collected from Rizal Park to Port Area to Ermita to Quiapo that included cigarette butts, candy and snack wrappers, plastic bags, cups, bottles and straws, polystyrene food containers and bamboo skewers that often cause injuries to barefooted devotees.(Updated to include birther controversy surrounding President Chester A. Arthur)
The Republican National Committee’s release of the “Growth & Opportunity Project” report (PDF)—its autopsy of where the GOP went wrong and how to fix it—has touched off a heated debate between the party’s establishment elites and its grassroots activists. That’s because the elites who authored the report implicitly lay much of the blame for the party’s misfortunes on the anti-immigrant, anti-gay, anti-minority sentiments that suffused the national conversation during Obama’s first term. Often this blame is couched in anodyne recommendations for winning over these disenchanted voters. For instance, the report says, “[T]he Republican Party must be committed to building a lasting relationship within the African American community year-round, based on mutual respect and with a spirit of caring.”
Implicit in the suggestion is that African Americans don’t feel respected or cared about by the GOP. While that is, on the one hand, head-smackingly obvious, it strikes me as the height of cynicism that the report doesn’t delve a little deeper into why this might be so. There are pages and pages of recommendations about hiring minority outreach directors, having a presence in black churches, rolling out black surrogates, and on and on. But the report says nothing—at least nothing that I saw—about the two biggest reasons why African Americans (and members of any minority group) might feel disrespected.
The first is the systematic effort by Republicans across the country to impose voter-identification laws that would mainly serve to disenfranchise minority voters. (Anyone interested in learning more about this problem should read the symposium on voting rights in the latest issue of the journal Democracy.)
The second is what many people regarded as the thinly veiled racism that lay at the root of the “birther” attacks claiming President Obama is a Muslim born outside the United States. At one point, public opinion polls showed that more than half of Republicans believed these absurd and insulting claims—claims that were difficult to imagine being lodged against a white president (UPDATE: I stand corrected — white president Chester A. Arthur weathered a birther controversy over whether he was born in Canada.)
What’s key about both these issues is that Republican elites were every bit as complicit in pushing them as were the activists, evangelicals, talk radio hosts and assorted other riff-raff that the report seems to fault for the party’s predicament. Indeed, Republican elected officials took the lead in pushing voter ID laws. And while birtherism may have originated at the lunatic fringe, it would never have gained such prominence without the active participation and encouragement of Republican elites—some of whom embraced the claim that Obama wasn’t a U.S. citizen, while others simply hinted at it in coded phases, saying they “didn’t have any information to prove otherwise” or “took the president at his word.”
I’ll leave it to those better qualified than I am to say precisely what effect this had on minorities’ view of the GOP (and not only minorities, but others turned off by this behavior). It’s worth noting, though, that while birtherism has died down—there’s no longer political advantage to be gained from fanning those flames—the push for voter ID laws continues. That campaign runs counter to what the “Growth & Opportunity” project aims to accomplish, at least with minority voters, and it’s why the report strikes me as an exercise in futility.Orbisius bbPress Enhancer

Japan’s Drive in Central Asia
By Hisane MASAKIEnergy-poor Japan is revving up its diplomatic drive to strengthen relations with the oil and gas rich countries of Central Asia in response to stubbornly high oil prices. This comes at a time when the US, Russia and China are all flexing their political muscles in Central Asia, competing in an attempt to secure the region’s precious energy resources.Japan’s driveJapan is preparing to invite foreign ministers from five Central Asian countries — Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan and Turkmenistan — to Tokyo as early as late May for the second ministerial level round of the “Central Asia Plus Japan” dialogue, which was inaugurated in 2004. Although the ministerial get together was originally planned for August last year, it was postponed because Japan’s Lower House was dissolved at that time prior to general elections in September. Now, with a government firmly in place, the stage is set for energy talks.Japan and the five Central Asian countries are expected to tackle a number of issues during the forthcoming meetings. Topics are to include anti-terrorism measures, Tokyo’s support for the early entry of nations such as Uzbekistan and Tajikistan into the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and any other assistance the East Asian country can provide for economic development and stability in the resource-rich but volatile region.
The Central Asia Plus Japan dialogue was launched at Tokyo’s request in August 2004, when the then Japanese foreign minister, Kawaguchi Yoriko, visited four of the five Central Asian countries — Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan. Kawaguchi and her counterparts from the Central Asian countries held the first ministerial level meetings in Astana, Kazakhstan. The Japanese minister touted the launch of the dialogue as evidence that relations between Japan and Central Asia had “entered a new era.” Since then, Japan and the Central Asian countries have met in Sofia, Bulgaria; Tashkent, Uzbekistan and again in Astana.The second round of the six-way negotiations follows a growing number of meetings between high level officials of Japan and the Central Asian states in recent years. Most recently, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev visited Tokyo in early March at the invitation of the Japanese government and held talks with Prime Minister Koizumi Junichiro and other government and business leaders.In his talks with Koizumi, Aliyev spoke about his country’s economic development plans and mentioned that Baku was interested in closer economic co-operation with Tokyo. Separately, Aliyev met with Foreign Minister Aso Taro. They agreed to foster co-operation in the development of oil and natural gas exploration in Azerbaijan. Aso told Aliyev that Japan held Azerbaijan in high regard as a supplier of oil and natural gas, while the Azerbaijani president expressed his hope that Japanese companies would participate in infrastructure improvements and co-operation in the Central Asian country.The Central Asia Plus Japan programme follows on from earlier efforts, started in 1997, by former Japanese premier Hashimoto Ryutaro. The expansion of Japanese activities in Central Asia is being touted as “Silk Road” diplomacy.
In July 2002, Japan sent a high-power mission of government and industry officials — the Silk Road Energy Mission — to Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan to explore possible areas of co-operation. Japan is also a core provider of official development assistance (ODA) to Central Asian and Caucasian nations.The Japanese dialogue is widely seen as reflecting a desire to play a greater geopolitical role, not only in Central Asia but also in Eurasia, while countering the growing influence of Russia and China in the region.Japan’s rivals for influenceIn a development that raised eyebrows in the US, Japan’s most important ally, China issued a joint statement with Russia and four Central Asian countries at a summit of the Shanghai Co-operation Organisation (SCO) last July calling for an early withdrawal of US forces from Central Asia.This fits into Moscow’s efforts to reduce — or at least compete with — US unilateralism. In particular, Russia is determined to maintain its hold over the former Soviet Union states, as can be seen through its support of Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko and Uzbekistani President Islam Karimov despite Western criticism of their regimes. Meanwhile, Japan’s ties with both Russia and China are far from easy. Japan and Russia are still at loggerheads over the Kuril islands, which were seized by Soviet troops in the closing days of World War II. This territorial dispute has prevented the two countries from concluding a formal peace treaty ending hostilities.Japan’s relations with China have also plunged to their lowest point in decades over Koizumi’s repeated visits to the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo.Beijing has shunned top level contact with Japan in protest over Koizumi’s visits to the shrine, where 14 Class A World War II criminals, including former Japanese Prime Minister General Tojo, Hideki are commemorated along with around 2.5 million war dead.Japan has also frequently locked horns with China over natural gas reserves in the East China Sea and beyond. Furthermore, both lobbied hard for a pipeline from Russia’s eastern Siberian oilfields.The Sino-Japanese rivalry over energy resources shows signs of spreading to the Middle East. In early 2004, Japan and Iran signed a US$3 billion deal to develop Iran’s massive Azadegan oilfield. But with international tensions rising over Tehran’s nuclear programme, there are growing concerns in Tokyo about how the nuclear crisis will play out. China recently won rights to the Yadavaran oilfield in Iran. Many analysts point out that should Japan be forced to give up the Azadegan project as part of international pressure on Tehran, Beijing could step in to replace Tokyo. Japan imports nearly all of its crude oil. To ensure its energy security, Tokyo is desperate to diversify its hydrocarbon sources in order to reduce its heavy reliance on the Middle East for crude oil imports. As such, an obvious choice for the country is to turn to the Central Asian and Caucasian nations.Japanese projectsAmong other projects in the region, Japan’s Itochu Oil Exploration and Inpex have a 3.92% interest and 10% interest, respectively, in a production-sharing agreement (PSA) for three fields in the South Caspian Sea. The Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli (ACG) fields are located approximately 120 km southeast of Baku in Azerbaijan. The Japanese government-backed Inpex also has an 8.33% interest in the Kashagan oilfield in Kazakhstan.
ACG Oil Project in AzerbaijanJapan’s Itochu Oil Exploration and Inpex also participated in the consortium that built the Baku- Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline, with interests of 3.4% and 2.5%, respectively. The Japanese government-affiliated Japan Bank for International Co-operation (JBIC) also signed a loan agreement of up to US$580 million for the link in early 2004. The BTC connects Azerbaijan’s vast Caspian Sea oilfields to the Turkish Mediterranean port of Ceyhan via Tbilisi, Georgia. It has further been suggested that oil from Kazakhstan could also be transported through the pipe.
BTC PipelineThe US strongly supported the project, seeing it as a way to loosen Russia’s energy grip on the South Caucasus.
China competes China became a net importer of crude oil in 1993 and overtook Japan as the world’s second-largest oil consumer — with the US secure in the top spot — in 2003.China now depends on imports for more than 40% of its oil. Beijing’s aggressiveness in the global oil market drew particularly widespread attention last summer when China National Offshore Oil Corp. (CNOOC) launched a takeover bid for US oil and gas firm Unocal. CNOOC eventually dropped out of the race after strong opposition from US politicians, leaving Chevron to take the prize.In Central Asia, China National Petroleum Corp.’s (CNPC) took over the Canada-based oil firm PetroKazakhstan, which operates solely in Kazakhstan, for US$4.2 billion last year.China and Kazakhstan also inaugurated a 1,000 km long oil pipeline in December to send oil to western China, the first major export pipeline from the landlocked Central Asian republic that does not cross Russia. Eventually another pipeline will link up with this one from the Caspian region in western Kazakhstan, where the huge new Kashagan oilfield is being developed.The second ministerial round of the Central Asia Plus Japan group in Tokyo also comes at a time when the Japanese government is compiling a new national energy strategy, which is intended to secure energy supplies. The new strategy should be in place by summer. In addition, the meeting coincides with Tokyo’s efforts to overhaul its ODA policy in an attempt to make financial assistance a more effective foreign policy tool in the pursuit of its strategic interests. Japan will, however, have a difficult time securing the necessary energy resources from Central Asia. The country lacks the sheer military force that the US, Russia and China can all bring to influence events in the region. However, the cash reserves that Tokyo can offer provide the country with substantial sway and Japan’s policy of pushing dialogue is likely to afford it the means of tapping oil and gas reserves.

Gorgeous!
this is so so so so so lovely
GOSH this is incredibly gorgeous, I’ve always loved the palace as a local but this shoot is drool worthy! Would have loved if they featured the grounds a bit more. Stunning
FABULOUSLY DONE, the cakes r the best of all 4 me followed by the decorations n settings. Overall, its really beautiful.
Very nice and clear picture …… Thumbs up to Mr Alakija again
The only down side, the wedding gowns are so outdated and not trendy ……. Hardly any of the wedding dresses made me say “awwwwwww”
The wedding gowns are in the 90 s so i am a bit confused as this is 2013 …. Those gowns are at best HIDEOUS and take away from the wonderful skills of the photographer. As in seriously who will wear those gowns now for their wedding . The styles are very outdated
Thot I was the only one not seeing “the light”
My sista May God bless you!!!!
The dresses are sooooooo… ugly it is unbelievable. The deco is great, but that’s because it’s in hand and the venue is beautiful.
The cakes are just okay, the gold trimmings on the cake are not smooth, could be better. A little OTT for me.
omg, thought it was just me. worst dresses ever!
This will make you wanna spend money.Classy, Royal, Splendid.
Always fabulous work when it comes to these guys, they are masters of their craft. Inspiration mode activates. Those table layouts are just mwah!
Please apart from the wedding cakes, the dessert table which were certainly impeccably done, the rest of it was blah to me. The tablecloths looked rumpled and frumpy; the wedding dresses not so fabulous, I was actually disappointed.
Please who wears braids on their wedding day??? Let alone very old braids?
There is no inspiration here, nothing I can take away from the photos and nothing that will make me want to contact any of the vendor.
I know plenty people who have worn braids on their wedding day my cousins included. That most Nigerian brides don’t doesn’t mean that the rest of Africa and black female population does not. Not old ones like these I am talking about three day old beautifully styled braids, And aren’t sisters who where locs also braided in a sense and they wear their hair like that for their weddings.
thank God ur name is naija talk. let the oga at the top catch you making such statements. everything about it is lovely.
Omg, this is crazy. I love!!!

There are delays in Warwickshire on May’s Hill in Henley-in-Arden at the A4189 junction after a crash.
Good news elsewhere though as that stationary traffic on the A45 Coventry Road inbound in Elmdon at the Goodway Road junction near Birmingham seems to have cleared.
The delays on the A45 southbound at Tollbar Island are still causing some disruption.

The roads are looking pretty good this morning, which is great news if you’re starting bright and early like me!
There is, however, stationary traffic on the A45 Coventry Road inbound in Elmdon at the Goodway Road junction near Birmingham because of a crash.
Traffic has also started to build up on the A45 southbound at Tollbar Island. But that’s a delay you really should be expecting by now!.Features » September 14, 2007
Trending Toward Inanity (cont’d).
This isn’t an isolated example. In a chapter called “Aspiring Snipers,” Penn explains, “It’s the rare moment when a poll stops me in my tracks and reorients my understanding of things.” One such poll was conducted last fall, when Bendixen and Associates asked 601 young Californians what they’d be doing in 10 years. About 1 percent–so, a handful–said they’d be snipers. Certainly, that’s an odd reply. But Penn never mentions that the Bendixen poll had a margin of error of plus-or-minus 4 percent–four being a larger number than one.. (It is bitter, though. Penn concludes the chapter by complaining, “Ask anyone in politics and they will agree–they face ‘snipers’ every day who are trying to find one flinch, one out-of-place word to put on Drudge or YouTube.” It takes a special sort of self-regard to compare the danger of being embedded on YouTube to being hunted down in urban warfare.)
Elsewhere, Penn conflates one poll on attitudes toward the religion of Islam with attitudes toward American Muslims. At times, he mixes percentages and absolute values for scare effect, as when he darkly warns that if one-tenth of one percent of our population–300,000 people–turned to al Qaeda, it would be “more than enough to destabilize our society.” Sometimes he just discards data, as when he conveniently decides to ignore his evidence that churchgoers reject female ministers and speculates that “consensus and compassion may be on the outs right now, but they are bound to make a comeback,” which is all the argument he needs to say “we are also ready for the first female Billy Graham.” And on, and on.
All this is in service of his concept that “microtrends” now govern our world: “It takes 1 percent of people making a dedicated choice–contrary to the mainstream’s choice–to create a movement that can change the world,” Penn writes. Why 1 percent? Who knows? Penn doesn’t stick to it himself. Sometimes, it’s one-tenth of one percent, as in his al Qaeda example, or 10 percent, as with lefties, or sometimes it’s the microtrend of–I kid you not–the tens of millions of Americans who moved to the suburbs in the 20th century. Toward the book’s end, Penn says the “magic of the 1 percent threshold” is that “ten people with bazookas can overcome 1,000 people with picket signs, but they can’t overcome 10,000 people with picket signs.” Chew on that one, grasshopper.
As microchapter after microchapter passed, reviewing this book began to feel like dropping a grenade into a barrel of fish. But Microtrends is illuminating..

Like I mentioned in a previous post, I was excited to see the Dance version of “Day By Day”. Well, the video has been released. And how can I put this nicely. I am so-so about this dance version. At first, I was didn’t like it at all. Now it’s growing on me… sort of. It helps to watch it after watching a few of their live performances of the song. I, for one found that the video was not edited very well. I don’t do well with constant flashing between shots. I get the feeling of having seizures or something like that. And the back and forth between the black suits and the white suits, somewhat hurt my eyes. But, these are all things I can get over because of the song itself and the original music video. I guess, because of the original music video, I was hoping that this version would be that, but just with dance. Like T-ARA dancing on the bridge or something. Or T-ARA on Motorcycles. Maybe I set my expectations too high? I mean overall, the girls still look beautiful and I always love their funky dance skills.
In this dance version we are introduced to Ahreum, the other newest member. I am actually confused why Dani is not in the video since she was in the original. I know that Dani is not officially going to make her debut with the group until later this year, but I figured since she already showed her face that she would be in this version too. I am still on the fence with Ahreum, just like I am with Dani. I will have to watch her a little more. I think she sticks out when watching the live performances of this song. Not sure what it is, maybe it’s just because she’s new that I’m thinking that she sticks out. I will have to see.
I have been noticing more people commenting on how this song sounds like Britney Spears’ “Criminal”. I had to listen for myself. Although both songs start off with a similar flute solo in the beginning and both have a similar catchy rhythm, I really don’t think that “Day By Day” is a rip off of “Criminal”. Similar sounding… yes, copy… no. The same thing can be said about Lady Gaga’s “Born this Way”… sounds strangely similar to a Madonna song, yet the radio played this song to death. Besides, I’m not sure why people are getting all fussy about it anyway. In this day and age, is there anything truly original sounding? Probably not. Most artist draw their inspirations from other artist, who too were also inspired by other artist. So in all actuality everyone copies everyone. I mean really, are we going to have another Vanilla Ice VS. David Bowie situation? I don’t think so. The songs sound similar, but you can tell they are clearly two different songs.
I am just hoping that one day T-ARA can cross over to the States! Fingers Crossed! 🙂

DEFENDING women’s division champion Perpetual Help Lady Altas ended the year 2012 with an impressive 25-12, 25-21, 25-19 victory over the Intramuros-based Letran Lady Knights to keep their slate clean in the 89th Season of NCAA at Filoil Flying V Arena in San Juan City.
Lady Altas of Coach Jason Sapin and Sandy Rieta were still unscathed in five games to remain seated at the top spot with reigning MVP Sandra Delos Santos collecting 17 markers, 15 of which came from attacks.
Perpetual continued its dominance in the league, extending its winning streak to 19 since the previous season.
Four of their five games this year were decided in just three sets. The lone team to push them into a five-setter was San Sebastian, 25-19, 22-25, 25-14, 20-25, 21-19.
The men’s team of Philippine coach Sinfronio ‘Sammy’ Acaylar, meanwhile, subdued the Letran Knights, 22-25, 25-23, 19-25, 26-24, 15-11, behind the 23 points of skipper Jay dela Cruz.
Junior Altas’ Eldrige Capal took the lead, meanwhile, in Perpetual’s 25-14, 25-20, 25-19 victory over Letran.
The younger Altas cruised past the Squires with Capal scoring 15 points built around eight spikes and four<< Adventure Path Subscriber. 273 posts (1,374 including aliases). 1 review. No lists. No wishlists. 14 aliases.

I have trouble believing that Norborger (or any god) sits around wistfully looking back on the good ol' days when they were a mythic mortal and could interfere more directly.
Also, I'm not seeing "divine balance" anywhere in anyone else's posts - I might be missing it, though. Who are you arguing with there?
No one in particular; rather the notion of how the gods are presented as a whole
I don't think any of the gods care about balance, except maybe Pharasma... maybe. I think they care about doing as much as they can get away with.
Really? From everyone's post it seems to be the entire crux of why the gods do and don't do things. And the vibe I'm getting now is that the gods can't do much of anything except grant spells; and you don't even need to be a full god to do that..
In Iron Gods when
It kind of turns the idea of the Mythic Journey on its head when gods can't interfere without screwing things up. It's hard to care that Aroden died when anything that he would have done would have just made things worse. In fact, what difference does it make that any god dies (except Pharasma)?
This is partly why not a single player that I've ever GM'd in PF has given one hoot about Aroden's death. It's never going to be explained and has no impact on the players so no one cares; it's just a piece of background fluff that most players have forgotten or pay no attention to even if they remember. That's fairly lackluster for what's supposed to be one of the grand mysteries of the setting.
Mutually Assured Destruction and social/economic conditions keeps them all in check, at the tiers in which they operate.
Mutually Assured Destruction and social/economic conditions keeps them all in check, at the tiers in which they operate.
Eh, that's the excuse forgotten Realms use in 3.0 for why the plethora of epic levels wizards never killed each other. Elminster's line was, "Sure I could kill so-and-so, but they could do the same to me". My first thought when I read that was, "No, he couldn't, you just killed him!"
I don't care for the notion that the gods can't really do anything major because of nuclear detente. It makes the gods seem as if their made of porcelain. Mortals can become gods (Cayden), they can die (Aroden), or become utterly corrupted to the point that their profile changes (Zon-Kuthon). Heck, even a computer AI can become a god. They can be ganged up on and sealed away (Rovagug). None of these things caused the apocalypse.
Perhaps the only one who has the power for rampant destruction and is unbothered by the threat of mutually assured destruction is the god OF destruction, Rovagug. Given the opportunity to, I'm sure that HE would personally interact with the world on a grand scale.
I have trouble believing that any of the Outer Gods or Great Old Ones cares one whit about "Divine balance". Divine balance makes sense in a cosmology where duality is perfectly maintained but Golarion's about as far from being divinely balanced as you can be; even before taking into account Empyreal Lords, First World gods, Devil/Demon Lords etc. etc.
I agree with Darkholme.
While I understand that the specific outcomes of of an AP aren't canon (as different groups will have different outcomes) but the general events have to be considered canon-applicable otherwise there's no point in having them in Golarion.
Maybe the events of Jade Regent never happen in my campaign because I never run it. Nevertheless, I have to assume that all the events that could happen fit within the logic of Golarion canon.
So I have to believe, regardless of whether I actually run Wrath of the Righteous for my players or not, that deities can alter players alignments at will.
One thing I can't do is assume that AP's are violating canon; that way lies madness. But having deities arbitrarily changing a person's alignment raises a lot of questions that need clarification. If not, then the whole issue seems to validate all the negative complaints about alignments that people make.
A lot of these arguments make sense if you've been buying since the beginning of PF and have had the 10+ years to digest the rules as they've been released. But every year that passes there are more and more gamers who haven't had that luxury. I don't want PF to become one of those "cliquish" games that only the long-term and/or wealthy are playing.
GURPS is a horrible example. With the release of 4th ed. (back in 2004), Steve Jackson stopped doing the wave of both licensed and generic splatbooks.
I don't see how you could continue buying AP's without buying the rulebooks. Looking at the Mummy's Mask AP and the books it expects you to have, out of the hardbacks you need a fairly up to date collection. Add in the softcovers and it's overwhelming. PF has more softcovers OOP than most games (successful or otherwise) will ever release.
The cost of entry makes it very hard on the new gamer and every release makes it harder. As I said earlier, I can't get anyone to play PF; they'd rather play 13th Age. I could write an entire encyclopedia of why I think PF is better than 13th Age and it won't matter because they see PF as too big an investment.
The problem I have with PF is that I can't get anyone else to buy the game because people are too intimidated by the 15 hardcover books on the shelf and they don't feel like spending the time (and don't have the luxury) to achieve the system mastery that those of us who have had 10+ years to slowly digest the rules have had.
And if I go to someone else's game I find they've banned half the material I've bought anyways. That makes me feel like I've wasted my money. So that's no new people coming into the game plus me who is now reluctant to buy anything, regardless of how high quality it is, because it's unlikely that I'll ever get to use it.
According to 'My Subscriptions', the Iron Gods #2: Lords of Rust book was shipped to me on the 19th. I haven't received it and I also never received the confirmation email telling me that an item has shipped (which is what led me to check My Subscriptions in the first place). While that's still within the 4-8 day window of delivery, I've never had a subscription take more than 3 days to arrive after receiving the confirmation email. However, I never got that email. This is the first time a product has ever been late and the first time I haven't received a confirmation email so I'm worried that something's fallen through the crack somewhere. I don't see an order # listed under My Subscriptions.
What's the actual problem?
Is it:
a) Women are hyper-sexualized
or
b) Men aren't hyper-sexualized enough
If the problem is "a" then the solution is to stop doing it. Doing the same with men doesn't solve the problem nor does it "balance it out"; it just creates two problems where there was one.
If the problem is "b" then artwork, especially on covers, needs to be planned ahead with far more care and thought.
Both "a" and "b" can't be the problems though. Either hyper-sexualization is wrong or it's not. If it is then doing "b" is just as wrong and if it isn't then "a" isn't really the problem.
Yes, but that hardcover book would be useful when you add psychic related player races, monsters, magic/tech items, feats, archetypes, spells/abilities, places, and psychic phenomenon along with those classes, archetypes, and PrCs.
But not needed. You could say the same for just about anything: gunsslingers, tian xia martial arts, Numerian super science, Mwangi animism/totemism, evocation specialists, etc., etc.
All that stuff is interesting but you don't need a hardcover detailing every possible permutation of its use. That's what 3.5 did, bloat themselves into uselessness. We don't need a hardback for something that's only going to pop up in two or three places on the planet.
To be honest, that's what I didn't care for about the Gunslinger. Not the mechanics but the notion of making a core class for something that's ultra-rare outside of one point in the world. Most gunslinging, outside of the Mana Wastes and what-not, is likely represented by the Amateur Gunslinger feat. But once you make it a core class you've made it as common as any fighter.
One set in a place that hasn't been touched yet. I like to see Golarion revealed (even if not necessarily explored ). Pathfinder is very crunchy and that makes it hard to just handwave content for spaces on the map that we have nothing for but a name.
Orbots, unite!
Whatever book they do I doubt it will be a hardback. You don't need an entire corebook sized set of rules to cover psychics (or whatever). Three base classes with some archetypes and PrC's will be enough. A lot of psychic (or whatever) stuff can already be done with the existing rules so I doubt they're going to reinvent the wheel (plus, I'm assuming, they probably don't really feel like churning out 200+ pages of psychic "spells").
I'm sure they'll do something eventually because otherwise all those places where they've already mentioned that such things exist just become white blanks on the map; they might as well not even be there then. I highly doubt they'll use another companies system, not matter how good; especially for Society play. That can of worms is just too big.
I bought and read 13th Age when it came out and thought it looked really good but I haven't looked at it since. Glad to know they're coming out with more stuff. I'll need to go through the rules again though. I'm thinking maybe a rogue/thief type. Everyone complains about how bad they are in PF; maybe I'll give the 13th Age version a shot.
Based solely on the information given, you did the right thing.
However, I'm not surprised to hear a story like this. Going through forums for a lot of "modern" games a common recurring theme seems to be that the GM isn't really a Game Master anymore but rather a circus performer present only for the sole benefit of the player's giggles.
It's not an issue if you only worry abour reprinting OOP modules. New players can't get any of that stuff except through vastly inflated secondary market prices (and Paizo doesn't see any of that money either). There wouldn't be a reprint if the original never sells out. Telling new players, "You can't have this, you should've gotten in earlier. Neener, neener." isn't a sound strategy. The amount of material, its cost, the level of system mastery needed, and lack of availability for current edition products are all blocks to new players coming in; that's lost money too. PDF's can be nice until you have to print them out in a durable format at which point you're paying more for the product than you would have buying the book; also not attractive to new players. Paizo has a loyal fanbase but selliing only those who are already playing is going to give diminishing returns over time unless all current players buy everything that comes out. To new players, PF is becoming an increasingly harder sell.
You would only do a compilation when the original is OOP; in whole or in part. If the AP is still fully available then there's no need to do a compilation but once even one module goes OOP the market for it is pretty dead if you aren't going to re-realease..
That's the problem I have with PF: if you've been following since the beginning (or close to it) it's great but new players kind of get the shaft. There are a lot of books, it's very expensive, and even if you're willing to pay all that there are still many things you just can't get.
I'm not trying to GM a video game. I don't think players are entitled to a "god mode" just because they can't handle the occassional loss or need to run away. I think there are far better outlets for that than a tabletop rpg. In my opinion, I don't think its the role of the GM to play court jester handing out mechanical benefits like candy to players who can't seem to envisualize a concept without them. The GM is playing the game as well and is entitled to as much fun as the players. Being the clown for the players amusement doesn't strike me as fun. If that's how you enjoy the game though then knock yourself out but I think most GM's would get bored with 1-round encounters all the time.
Ninja'd by Thunderfrog.
The reason people think concepts suck is because GM's super optimize their encounters as they think the players will do the same with their characters. So a concept only sucks when the rules don't allow it it to be super-optimized. If you take away the need for super-optimization then less concepts will suck (and you'll have less math to do to boot) since you don't need to go hog wild nuts with the build.
All that super optimizing just makes fewer builds viable and takes longer and more effort to get the ones that do to work. There's no need to go to the hassle of nuclear power when steam works perfectly well.
I agree with all the advice given here. If the players super-optimize then the GM has to as well. This just creates a zero-sum benefit but everyone had to do more math.
Then it's smart not to have him go down the well then. Lol.
In that case, it would probably be smart not to go down at all then :) Unfortunately, Adventurer Personality Afflictive Disorder (APAD) trumps having a high Wisdom.
Out of curiosity, if we do go down the well and make it do we get t-shirts that say, "I went down the well!" on the front with "And survived!" on the back?
It's still fun to create a race even if I end up not needing it since I'll have the time. I don't have a solid concept yet, I may have to pull out some oldies but goodies for inspiration (Talislanta, Skyrealms of Jorune, etc.).
I haven't posted crunch yet as there seems to be a problem with the Wolflair store that has prevented me from downloading the ARG data package for HeroLab. I always prefer to use HeroLab as it's so much quicker and I don't have to worry about my math being wrong (I can also export the character straight into BBCode so it's like two clicks to copy the character into my alias). It's also nice not having to look through 5-6 books trying to remember which book that one feat was in.
As a sidenote, I don't drop stats below 10 except for racial modifiers. It's just my personal preference. I mainly bring it up to forestall questions like, "Why didn't you dump "X" down to 2? Monks don't need it anyways!"
It just occured to me that I could still go ahead and create a race and just set it aside for a "next" character; that would give me the time to develop it better. I've never played through Rappan Athuk before but, from what I understand, it's degree of difficulty is higher than your standard PF AP which will (likely) mean a higher percentage of PC deaths.
I had thought of designing a race but was afraid I wouldn't have time to do it justice. If I design a race, I want more than just a list of abilities; I want at least some idea of what it "means" to be that race, where do they come from, why has nobody ever seen one before, etc., etc. I also find it's (usually) better to create races in a vacuum otherwise, it's too easy to fall into the trap of making a race that simply pumps up whatever class currently catches your fancy. I've found that to be a big problem in a lot of science fiction rpg's; certain races are so obviously geared to a certain class/role that if you're playing "X" then you're almost always playing "Y" too. At that point you might as well make the system "race as class" saving the designers and players a lot of time and be done with it.
Most of the submissions so far have been fairly low RP races; 6 to 11 in most cases.
I find it hard to credit that PF and/or Golarion, by accident or intent, is designed to simulate Order of the Stick(tm).
Brown Lotus lacks a strong sense of self-personality. He's never had to show initiative on his own before and, when left to himself, lacks (to a certain degree) the sense of context that life experiences give to help with decision making. The high rarity of his race diminished the sense of identity that the revelation of what he is might otherwise have brought. He would likely have been very happy to have stayed at the temple, where he could have identity as part of a welcoming group, but the monks there realized that this would only have stunted his need for individual development.
An adventuring group would be a natural fit, if given the opportunity, as it would remove much of the social pressure from him while allowing him to get vital life experience. Also, his oddness isn't out of place in an adventuring group who are considered by many to be a rather odd lot to begin with.
As for heading into dungeons, I see it as doubtful that he has any preference for one adventure type over another and is likely to go along with whatever the group consensus seems to be. This will be mostly true at lower levels where his lack of experience makes him hesitant to venture an opinion of his own volition. After a couple of levels, his confidence and sense of self will grow and that will start to change.
In my head, the Temple of the Transparent Lotus was mostly LG so that's the alignment I see him as. If the group ends up as almost all Neutral though I can change him to LN as this would have been a large factor in deciding whether or not to join a given group.
I have an idea for an Oread Monk (Qinggong). He was once the property of a merchant of Katapesh who was killed, while travelling, by an overzealous (and not quite all right in the head) Inquisitor of Hanspur, the Water Rat. Unsure of what to make of the "golem" travelling with the merchant, the Inquisitor decided he didn't really care and wandered off. Unsure what to do with his newfound freedom, and believing himself to be a magic object and not a sentient being, he wandered randomly until stumbling upon the Temple of the Transparent Lotus where he was informed that he was an actual being and not a construct. He has no true name that he knows of and so goes by his temple name: Brown Lotus.

In my opinion, "The campaign timeline never moves forward" is problematic over the long haul.
Personally, I agree. People who have both the time and inclination to make radical changes to a world based on their characters actions are often playing in a homebrew already because they have the time and inclination to do so (though, certainly, this isn't always the case).
The reason many people buy published settings is so they don't have to do all that work. Some people just don't have the time to keep track of the sensical changes that should be occuring and also might be timid of making a change which might conflict with an upcoming AP or story. Also, not everyone is a great worldbuilder and so they look to the company to provide it for them. Keeping that world in a frozen point of time is, imo, a mistake.
As for the original topic: Eventually, love it or hate it, PF 2.0 (or whatever they choose to call it) will come out. It may be sooner and it may be later but it's going to happen. How big a change that edition will be we'll just have to wait and see.
Paulcynic: If I'm playing a Plot-based game (the way you describe it), I'm not playing PF at all. Nor any game that uses a level-based mechanic. Level-based systems are already arbitrary abstractions. XP is no moreso than the levels themselves. Using levels without using the method that defines them seems backwards to the point of having a level system at all. If that's the kind of thing that negatively affects our narrative, then I'm going to switch to a more freeform point-based system and remove the stricture of levels entirely.
I should point out that, going back to OD&D to today, we don't let players calculate or track their own XP. When it was time to level the DM would say so. In the older editions characters advanced at different rates anyway so it didn't stand out as much.
With XP, the player(s) were/are rewarded (even if the didn't know how much) for making good decisions. Without it, as long as no one dies, it doesn't matter what kind of decisions player(s) make as the rewards are the same either way. To me, that's a more negative impact on the narrative than what you describe XP as doing since it seems, to me, to trivialize decision making outside of your build . As a GM, I want the players to consider whether the the decisions they're making are good ones or not and as a player, I want to have to consider that.
The way you describe "Plot-based" sounds like exactly how I want a non level-based game to run. But with levels, you're already adding in arbitrary plateaus of power. I don't see how removing XP makes arbitrary levels of power less arbitrary. If there's an arbitrary detractor here it's the levels, not the XP (especially when the classes aren't all balanced against each other--and, in PF, they aren't). And if levels aren't part of what the players are striving for, then why use them?
What does xp reward have to do with deciding between stopping the marauding dragon or rescuing the princess? Is one of those supposed to be the "path of least resistance" and the other the "high reward"?
Seems to me there would be good in character reasons to do either. Should those be overridden because one has a better xp reward?
What does xp reward have to do with deciding between stopping the marauding dragon or rescuing the princess? Is one of those supposed to be the "path of least resistance" and the other the "high reward"?
The players wouldn't know the XP rewards which should, IMO, be based on how well and/or cleverly they dealt with it anyways. There are better and worse choices in dealing with any challenge and the reward should be adjusted accordingly, IMO.
If they're going to be rewarded every 3 sessions regardless what difference does it make how they handle the challenge as long as it doesn't result in a TPK?
Characters are going to have a wide variety of motivations and reasons for doing things. You're not going to have every challenge perfectly mesh with every players in character reasons. And if by some means you manage it then there's no reason to even bother offering the other challenge as an option.
It's far more entertaining, for me, to give and receive rewards based on what the characters do and how they do it rather than just, "It's been three sessions and you all lived so level up."
But when you've been leveling the players every three sessions then, at some point, they're going to start expecting it.
It isn't so much about chasing the loot as it about you're going to get the loot regardless of what decisions you make. Stay in town and deal with the corrupt mayor or ride north to fight the bandits or explore the swamp to the south? Doesn't matter because it's level and loot in 3 sessions regardless. As a player or a GM, I don't find that very entertaining. For me, player decisions need to have more importance than just, did they survive the three sessions to level?
Of course, I remember the days where leveling up was not simply a case of XP, but of money (which varied depending on how "good" a role player you were, which was determined by the DM!) and finding a trainer who would facilitate elevation to the next level.
And characters didn't advance at the same rates anyways.
Sir Jolt wrote's always bizarre to me to read about things like this happening, as not a single one of my gaming groups ever did things like this. About the same for 90% of the complaints on these forums, really. Makes me just kind of sit back and think, "Really? There are people who really behave like this?" happens because players stop thinking about the here and now of the game and are instead looking at that feat they're going to get at the next level instead of deciding if they should go stop the marauding dragon or instead rescue the princess from the evil sorcerer because, either way, that feat is coming in 2-3 sessions regardless. There needs to be a reason for players to consider the decisions they're making.
Unless the decision is so absurdly bad that it TPK's the group there really aren't any bad decisons. It's hard to be invested in a decision or course of action when there's no relevance to it. I prefer there to be more of a gradient to player/group decisons: stupid, bad, mediocre, good, excellent and reward appropriately rather than just having every 3rd session (or whatever) be the "level-up" session.
Having powerful character isn't something you earn.
This part I disagree with. Too many players seem to have a sense of entitlement about progression. Not only do they think they're going to level every 2-3 sessions (or whatever), they expect it because they feel it's their "due".
I've never thought of rewarding good play as a "bribe" and it seems, to me at least, a rather strange notion to view it as such. To each his own, I guess.
thejeff: At one point, TSR released a pack of CD's with the first 250 (I think) issues of Dragon (or The Dragon) in them. You can get all the Wormy's that way but it just stops mid-story; there's no conclusion or wrap-up.
It's nice to see Len Lakofka's name mentioned again. I still weep over the loss of the Wormy comic strip; the greatest strip to ever appear in a gaming mag. Don't imagine if we'll ever know why Dave Trampier went MIA; no point in asking his brother-in-law, Tom Wham (I've tried), the most info I ever got was "Illinois".
The problem is, we're seeing the same arguements over the same stuff over and over and over again with no resolution and people getting more and more up-in-arms about it. We're starting to hit a point we're doing nothing is going to have a higher cost than making a change. The drama's already here and it's not getting better by keeping things as they are.
To people who have been following PF since day 1 it might not seem so bad but to many new players PF looks like a mess.
I agree about the freedom from 3.5 compatability. At the time, it made sense and was a big selling point. Now though, the need to keep something for "legacy" reasons just isn't as much of a concern. I don't think we really need Paizo to be the 3.5 torchbearer anymore; or even 3.75.
I find both to be very funny but in different ways. If I watch the first one though I usually do it on my computer. The panoramic shots from the first movie look terrible on a large high-end TV screen (well, they do on mine anyway).
I think that was probably intentional. Isn't there a line somewhere that says "their HD are determined by their class levels". The more HD you have the more awesome you are. Elves don't become more elf as time goes along but Wizards do become more Wizardy.
My Example: 6 HD of Giant is not equal to 6 HD of Fighter
My Example: 6 HD of Giant is not equal to 6 HD of Fighter
I agree but I think the OP's complaint is that the elf seems less like an elf as time goes on. I sort of agree but with the underlying math of the system I'm not sure there's much to be done about it that hasn't already been done (mechanically).
I'm very wary of comparisons to, and complaints of, earlier editions; especially 1st. The game wasn't scaled to 20th level in 1st edition. Your "high-level end of campaign" type modules were ones like Tomb of Horrors and Queen of the Demonweb Pits; both 10-14th level. This is because the game mechanics started to break down once characters hit their "lord" levels; typically, between levels 8 and 10. Racial level limits were almost completely meaningless as the system was already going wonkers long before you hit those caps and especially if you were multi-classing. If you were playing to those levels you already had to houserule like crazy just to make the system work.
Wow. How has this escaped my notice since almost a year ago?
1d100 ⇒ 94 Ooze-based Humanoid (wildcard, make your own!)
1d100 ⇒ 99 Mul (half-human/half-dwarf hybrid)
1d100 ⇒ 78 Vodyanoi (salamander-like humanoids)
1d100 ⇒ 31 Duergar
1d100 ⇒ 34 Kitsune (shapechanging fox-folk)
Interesting mix. As I recall, the Mul were from Dark Sun which I don't have access to anymore. Is there info on them anywhere that I can access?
Each incident has the same chance, but over time things progress towards the average which is why when talking about the game in general referencing averages is useful.
Actually, it doesn't. That's the Gambler's Fallacy again; assuming that previous results somehow have an effect on future results. They don't.
Sure a single Kobold could walk up to the party and roll nothing but 20s and the party could all roll 1s and the Kobold would have TPK'd the party, but does that make the Kobold some mega-monster? Obviously not because the rolls in that one single incident were skewed. Instead you ask how likely is that to happen on average and the answer is not likely at all.
It only seems skewed because you obssessing over averages. If I flip a nickel a hundred times, how likely is it that I'll get heads every single time? Not very. But that chance isn't isn't any less than any other single combination of flips. Because how many times I flip heads has no bearing on how many times I'll continue to do so. The d20 is a flat probability. That "skewed" example you gave is no less likely than any other set of numbers than any other set of rolls the party an kobold might generate.
The same goes for the players, sure in any one encounter the dice could fall one way or the other, but over the characters career things will approach the average. Part of the fun of the game is that you don't know what the exact outcome of any encounter is going to be, you have to roll it out.
This goes counter to all your previous points. By your logic, you do know how an encounter's going to go because you've already run the numbers. When the probablity curve is completely flat, there are no extreme results. Your "avergae" result is no more likley than any other and isn't going to occur more often.
However by analyzing the averages you can determine how likely you are to win the encounter.
From a game design perspective you have to analyze and balance the averages as that is what is going to occur...etc etc.

From a game design perspective you have to analyze and balance the averages as that is what is going to occur...etc etc.
If this were really true, there would be no need to roll dice at all. You could just apply averages every round since, by your postulation, that's the end result anyway. These aren't things I'm making up here; these are established mathematical proofs. Things in PF are skewed but it's from looking for race/class/feat/spell combinations that load the results towards one end of the spectrum but none of that unflattens the probability of a certain number being rolled.
Unfortunately, IMO, your view is becoming more true as we continue to remove random elements from the game. Few roll stats, rolling hp is becoming less common, save or die results are largely gone and so tension is removed from the game because we've cooked the numbers to generate what we think the results should be and so, in that regard, the game is much more predictable. Letting the dice "fall as they may" is almost gone from PF because we take feats and abilities to ensure that doesn't happen.
That tension that you mentioned earlier no longer exists because we've made optimization (unfortunate as such a need scares off newbies especially as more material comes out) a virtual requirement so as to remove that tension. And players who don't get what they want get pissed so we play at higher than normal point buys and look for every bonus to remove how many time players need to boo-hoo over a bad roll. The biggest example of this was when treasure went from being something you earned to something you made for yourself while sipping afternoon tea plotting out your character already knowing what items he's going to get for the next 12 levels.
If you really want tension, look to indie games or games made before 3.0 came out. That was tension. PF? Not so much. PF is the rpg version of the first-person shooter when you've entered the cheat for extra ammo and lives (but not quite god-mode).
But monsters don't deal damage in averages. The result of one roll doesn't determine the result of subsequent rolls; that's the Gambler's Fallacy. If the hydra has a 1 in 3 chance of hitting it doesn't mean it's only going to hit 1 out of every 3 rounds. 37.5 damage is putting a big hurt on a 4th level character.
Rolling four 20's in a row on a d20 sounds improbable but it has the exact same probablity as rolling a 5, then a 12, then a 2, and then an 18. And if a I roll four 20's in a row four times in a row, my chance of doing it a fifth time is exactly the same as it was the first. This is why I hate all of the hyper-optimization average-analysis based threads that pop up all the time now. Games don't flow based on midpoints and arithmetic means. Well, they do if you decide to continue with the trend of removing as many random influences from the game as possible because, for some reason, randomness restricts creativity and is badwrongfun. :/

Irregardless is a beautiful word. It rates up there with misunderestimate and embiggen.
It's a joke word from an old Simpsons episode. The school has just watched a film about the history of the city where the founder used the word 'embiggens' (it's part of the town motto).
One teacher says to another: "You know, I never heard the word 'embiggens' before moving to Springfield."
Other teacher: "I don't know why; it's a perfectly cromulent word."
Go to Wikipedia and do a search on embiggens; it's actually very entertaining.
Those seem fairly solid and gives a good mix of motivations and desires.
Dotting for interest; I love Doctor Who too. Cubicle 7 has has the most recent version of the rpg. I gathered that it's fairly simple but I'm not familiar with it.
I need to read the definition of the spell again. Even if you're hovering over it I don't see how that helps if multiple 5' waves are constantly thrashing about in every direction. This is a fairly low-level spell; I think there's only so much it cand do.
I've always beleived that spells don't do anything apart from what's described in the spell. Water Walking lets you walk on the ocean but it doesn't calm it. I would definitely make it difficult terrain or require DEX/Acrobatics checks depending on how tumultuous the water was. At what point you apply that is a DM's call.
I'm in a bunch of campaigns but they're all having the same problem.
*No link I create to any Paizo thread works; it just comes up as a blank page. For PbP even finding the thread and clicking on the title doesn't work. I have to go to the original recruitment thread (which I can open) and click on the link there. That's a real hassle since I can't even link to the recruitment page. It's hard to remember what the thread is called since, normally, I don't click on it; I click on a link or favorites tab (neither of which works).
One was a Carrion Crown game by DM Haldhin, one a Jade Regent game by DM Hamied and a Skulss & shackles by DM Immortal. I just can't remember the actual thread name and they're hard to find as the dots and new posts are usually missing.
*I get dots and new post messages on threads I've never been to. Ones I have been to often have no dots or new post notifications and those few that do have wildly incorrect numbers.
*When I make a new post, it always goes to a blank page. If I hit refresh 4 or 5 times its about 50/50 whether my post shows up or just vanishes.
Also, these are the same problems I had on Tuesday. Not one thing mentioned is working better for me today than it was on Tuesday. I'm running IE 9 on a Windows 7 (64x) machine. No compatability mode (a pointless feature that few websites gain any benefit from; most get screwed up by it).

Fridge Horror
- The premise of Haruhi Suzumiya. At first glance the show looks like your regular high school comedy with an unusual element... until you realize the plot basically revolves around four people trying to keep a Jerk Ass God happy to prevent The End of the World as We Know It. So, they have to do anything she says and listen to her, including being sexually harassed, bossed around, and so on. Just one little temper tantrum, just one little argument with her love interest, heck, even just one stressful day, and the world is gone. And once you think about it a little bit more, you'll start to wonder what Haruhi is and is not responsible for, to put it simply. Overall, it becomes quite a darker story than you realize once you apply Fridge Logic.
- The ending to Disappearance. Just think about what all the other main characters' lives would've been like had it gone the other way...Complete casting has been announced for the first off-Broadway revival of Arthur Bicknell’s infamous 1983 flop Moose Murders. The Beautiful Soup Theater Collective's 30th anniversary revival will be directed by Steven McCasland and will feature a “shamelessly revised” script by Bicknell. Moose Murders will play New York’s Connelly Theatre January 29, 2013 through February 10.
The revival of Moose Murders will feature McCasland, Caroline Rosenblum, Cory Boughton, Ali Bernstein, Dennis DelBene, Orlando Iriarte, Anna Kirkland, Steven Carl McCasland, Noelle Stewart, Jordan Tierney and Brittany Velotta.
One of Broadway’s most notorious flops, Moose Murders played 13 previews at the Eugene O’Neill Theatre before closing on February 22, 1983. The play centers around a series of murders that take place while the Holloway and Keene families are stranded at the Wild Moose Lodge in the Adirondack Mountains.
Moose Murders will feature set and costume design by Dennis DelBene, lighting design by Christopher D’Angelo and fight direction Christopher Stokes.

Take your market audience, for instance, you have to know them but lots of IM marketers seem to overlook doing basic research about that. In addition to knowing how to talk to your market, you will understand their needs from a marketing perspective. Obviously you want to see something reflected in your results, and this one strategy is designed to do that. Communications and words are what power everything in business, and therefore your proficiency with knowing how to apply that with your niche market will determine your success. Your readers will never get to a point where they will fulfill your most desired response if they cannot relate to it. Drivers need to have insurance coverage; it is essential. With an action plan in place, finding the best plan at the most affordable cost can be accomplished. There are some important tips listed below to help you through the process of finding the best auto insurance plan to protect yourself. Your insurance coverage should never be permitted to run out, even when you are switching between plans. This will keep your insurance costs lower. Switching between many different policies and insurance companies can cause gaps in coverage, even if unintentional. Insurance companies do not like gaps in coverage, and they will raise your rates if they find out. Maintaining a good driving record is key to getting the best insurance premiums possible. Your rates can increase quickly because of an accident. You should accept any limitations you might have and avoid any situations that might lead to an accident. If you have poor night-vision, then avoid driving at night. Those who do not drive a lot, or who drive short distances, can sometimes get low mileage discounts on their policy. In order to be eligible for this type of discount, you generally have to drive below 7,500 miles per year. If you use public transportation for getting back and forth from work, this may mean you qualify for a discount as well. To get the lowest possible insurance rate for a new car, take the time to list all of its safety features. Side curtain and passenger air bags reduce the likelihood of injury and therefore may decrease the premiums you pay. This can save you money even if the features are added to an older vehicle. You should evaluate each item covered in your auto insurance to see if it might be worth dropping from your policy. If your vehicle is older and not worth a lot, you probably should drop the collision coverage. If you get rid of the insurance, it will save your money. You should also think about dropping your comprehensive and liability coverage. Tailor the amount of your vehicle coverage to the actual value of your car. Typically, a slightly older car or truck will require fewer coverage fees due to its lower value in the resale market. Look into how often your type of vehicle is stolen, as this can make a difference in your insurance rate. It does not matter if it's an older car, you should consider fuller coverage if your car model is commonly stolen. Trade in your sports car for something more insurance friendly. Sports cars are going to cost you a lot more to insure. Family-friendly cars tend to be the cheapest to insure. A larger engine also generally comes with higher insurance costs. Expensive vehicles are frequently targets of theft. This factors into your insurance cost. Installing security systems in your car, such as alarms and trackers could help you lower your insurance premiums. Theft associated with your car plays a huge role in calculating your insurance coverage. Your insurance will be lower if you have a safer vehicle. You might be able to save on auto insurance by obtaining a bundled insurance package. Which means you would benefit more if you get insurance for your car and your home at the same time. Make sure to compare the cost of combining your home and auto or insuring them separately before making the decision to bundle. As stated before, you can lower your insurance costs by changing some things. The location of your residence, your driving record and the amount of driving you do are factors that are controllable. By understanding how these factors can increase or decrease your driving risk in the eyes of your insurance company, you may be able to reduce your rates. So… What’s next?

The third anniversary of the announcement of Shenmue 3 is quickly approaching, and it sounds like the game may actually come out this year.
Shenmue 3 was first revealed back at E3 2015. The announcement came in the form of a Kickstarter campaign, which broke records upon going live, earning the desired goal and then some.
Last summer, creator Yu Suzuki revealed that the game has been delayed to the second half of 2018. But seeing as developer Ys Net is a small team, many expected the game to be pushed yet again.
Not according to Cedric Biscay, founder of Shibuya Productions studio – one of the teams working on Shenmue 3. Biscay confirmed in a tweet that Shenmue 3 is still on track for a 2018 release on PC, and PS4. What’s more, he teased a few “other surprises”.
I wish you a Happy New Year ! All the best for 2018 ! It will be great with the #Shenmue3 release on #PS4 and #PC and many other surprises 🙂 pic.twitter.com/DKvos1jNg9

Thetreeman's first and unsuccessful expedition!
[edit] Location
Ben Gurion Airport.
[edit] Participants
- thetreeman
- his father
- his baby brother
- and his baby brother's mother
[edit] Plans
PLAN A: Stop by on way back from work, use co-workers phone as GPS. Hopefully point won't be behind fence. *fingers crossed*
PLAN B: Get dad to give me a lift to point.
[edit] Expedition
So the whole "on the way back from work" thing went down the drain the moment we hit a major traffic jam and the timer was counting down for my cat's insulin shot.
So eventually I got around to convincing my father to give me a ride to the point.
We pretty much went round and about random terminal roads a few times before finally reaching a rather close destination, but we ended up being blocked by a large wall and fence. We also got a bunch of suspicious looks from airport staff, turns out the point was in an area belonging to airport operations, and members of the general public were discouraged from visiting...
Geohash attempt one is a moderate failure, I got within 100 meters of the point, but hopefully once my PC'll recognise my phone I'll have a picture of two to upload.
At least I got an adventure out of it.Page 1 of 1 | 16 products

im not sure it did that with me to i thought it was just my game.. maby its because the animations have a delay on them? i dont know, sorry ive tried to fix it but couldnt figure it out
I have a question. Will the hostage taker have the hostage in a headlock and you will have to take the shot? That would be awesome.
First of all, thank you! And now my problem, the female hostage stands allways and sometimes, integrated in another mission, runs away. This looks not very tied to me ;) I didn't change anything though. I am using Arma 2 free. The male hostages are fine. Thanks in advance.
This should work in MP correct?

Ever since James Cameron stunned the world with his 3D magnum opus Avatar, many in Bollywood nursed secret ambitions of making a 3D film some day. Thanks to technological breakthroughs and easy availability of technical support from Hollywood studios, the 3D wave hit Bollywood when Shirish Kunder announced his ambitious film Joker, which was supposed to be Bollywood’s first 3D film. While Kunder is still busy shooting his film, Vikram Bhatt’s Haunted 3D beat him to it. Now news is in that Farhan Akhtar’s Shahrukh Khan-starrer Don 2 is being converted into 3D. It is heard that Farhan had this 3D concept somewhere in his mind even while he was shooting the film, but only recently did he stumble upon a conversion technique which allows his production team to show one-dimensional films in 3D. We are not completely sure – maybe it was Shahrukh’s idea – after all, he himself is getting into 3D mode for his home-production RA.One. But whoever did whatever, these recent developments are exciting us no end! Of course, these 3D conversions are not the real deal, made from scratch, but still add to the cheap thrills quotient. Also, now that the 3D ball is rolling in Bollywood, let’s see who else manages to catch that bus.

With the Obama administration facing growing discontent among gay supporters, the mayors of Los Angeles and San Francisco joined in voicing concern today about a new U.S. Justice Department brief supporting the federal Defense of Marriage Act.
"I think it's a big mistake," San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom said shortly before he and his Los Angeles counterpart, Antonio Villaraigosa, kicked off the annual L.A. Pride parade in West Hollywood.
The 1996 law bars the federal government from recognizing same-sex marriages and enables states to refuse to recognize such marriages from other states. The Justice Department enraged leaders of gay rights groups Thursday by filing a lengthy defense of the law in a federal lawsuit in which its constitutional validity is challenged.
Newsom and Villaraigosa, potential rivals in next year's Democratic primary for governor, were both careful to avoid direct criticism of President Obama, who pledged during his campaign for the White House to repeal the marriage law.
"I'm concerned about some of the arguments being made by the Justice Department," Villaraigosa said.
Gay rights groups were more blunt. Rea Carey, executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force Action Fund, called the administration's defense of the law unacceptable.
"Unfortunately, the malicious and outrageous arguments and language used in the Justice Department's brief [are] only serving to inflame and malign the humanity of same-sex couples and our families," Carey said.
Representatives of neither the White House nor the Justice Department were immediately available for comment.
[Updated at 1:22 p.m.: White House spokesman Shin Inouye said the Justice Department, in submitting the brief, was following its normal practice of defending a law on the books in court.
"The President has said he wants to see a legislative repeal of the Defense of Marriage Act because it prevents LGBT couples from being granted equal rights and benefits," Inouye said of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender couples.
"However, until Congress passes legislation repealing the law, the administration will continue to defend the statute when it is challenged in the justice system."]

People were asking today if I had a good birthday. Honest answer? Sort of.
The day started off lovely. We slept in til 8 - we were pretty pooped after Kelly’s awesome wedding. We got ready and then headed out. Where to, you ask?
Sprinkles! Check out this NON-line:
AND, this EMPTY (ish) lot!
That’s our car there. Parked easily right in front of the store. THIS NEVER HAPPENS.
Ok I’ll calm down now. There wasn’t really an earth-shattering reason for the non-line and empty lot. We just got there right when they opened. :)
I got the chocolate coconut and Mat got the peanut butter chip.
We then went off to Starbucks. I used my free birthday drink to get a venti (when it’s free you get the big one, duh) java chip frappuccino. I got everything light and sugar free, but I did get whipped cream since it was my birthday.
I really wanted a salted caramel mocha frappuccino, but they were out of the toffee nut syrup that usual goes in it. So, I went back to an old favorite with the java chip.
You can tell from the picture that we went to the beach. Corona del Mar is my favorite beach. It has calm waves and isn’t very big. It’s the beach we always went to when I was a kid. There’s also lots of benches to sit on and grassy areas up above the water. That’s exactly what we did.
This is why I could never leave SoCal. Gas prices may suck, the economy may suck harder, and houses might be damn expensive, but holy cow is it gorgeous. And this is only a 10-15 minute drive from our apartment. One of our criteria for buying a house is that it be just as short of a drive to the beach. It’s a requirement.
We love the beach!
When Mat suggested going to the beach in the morning, it took zero convincing. Starbucks and cupcakes for breakfast? Sure, why not?
The afternoon was spent blogging and uploading pictures from Kelly’s wedding to Facebook. Mat made me a cake while I vegged out.
Then the day went blah. I think the tiredness of Friday and then being at a wedding on Saturday night caught up with me. I had a breakdown.
I generally have 2-3 breakdowns per school year, and unfortunately breakdown number 1 decided to rear its ugly head on my birthday. Talk about not fair! This is why my answer to “was my birthday good” is “sort of.”
Eventually I calmed down and we were able to enjoy dinner. Mat made me this baked pumpkin fettuccine that had appeared in my inbox a few days earlier (If you don’t read How Sweet It Is, you have to. Her recipes are A-MAZ-ING). Except we used whole wheat penne because Trader Joe’s doesn’t carry whole wheat fettuccine.
It. Was. Amazing.
Even though it’s technically not summer anymore, it’s felt like summer again around here so we made a salad with strawberries, red onion, feta cheese, and craisins dressed with raspberry vinaigrette. Yum!
Then it was time for dessert! Chocolate cake with chocolate frosting/filling and Trader Joe’s pumpkin ice cream.
This cake was supposed to have four layers, but as we were assembling it the top layer decided to crack apart. So now we have a random bowl of cake with frosting in the fridge in addition to the (now) three layer cake. Oh well. It still tasted delicious.
Oh yeah! What did Mat get me?
These!!
Ah, I love them! He actually gave them to me before we went to the beach, but I couldn’t wear them because I have a blister on my toe from the shoes I wore to the wedding and the open toe portion of the wedges hits in the exact spot. Sadness. :(
During dessert we watched some Boy Meets World and then hit the hay. Don’t you hate how fast your birthday goes by once you’re an adult? At least I still have family birthday dinner this Saturday!Saturday, July 30, 2005
My lucky day
And on a happy note, yesterday I found out that a dork is a whale penis. It all comes clear suddenly. I still love the word.
And now I must go and get ready for my class, and watch F1 qualifying on the Tivo.
Oh- and remind me to tell you about the Hemingway who lived in Missoula and Bozeman- that's another interesting one.
Friday, July 29, 2005
The Romanian- 1
She was a friend of my sister in law's from art school back east. She showed up in Missoula shortly before we moved to Arizona. She was staying with them, and kind of meandering around town. She bought a cheap old bike and a swim pass from the University. She would stop by my apartment on her way home from the pool, and we would talk.
She was a very tall girl, with a large moon-like face and huge brown eyes. Her mouth was very poochy and her eyebrows were bushy. She wasn't what I would call pretty- but she was interesting looking. My friend says that she smelled. I don't remember.
She was an artist- I bought one of her large paintings, and have it in storage now (no place large enough to put it). Her video piece was quite arty, and unwatchable. I could never figure out whether or not she was really good, or just really driven.
Her story was sad, though. Seems that while in NYC she had had a psychotic break during a manic ephisode, and broke a bunch of windows on one of the major streets. She was hospitalized and put on lithium to control the severe bipolar illness. It really changed her, apparently. She was quite odd when it came to relationships. She was intense. She fell in love very quickly and hard. She fell for a friend of Spouse's right away. He was also a twisted puppy, and appeared to like her quite a lot. I remember her cooking dinner for us all one night. Over the dessert of grapes and white wine (with lithium?), she said to him, "Krriss, Krriss, I want to know your soul." I knew then that something was a tad off. They had known each other for about 4 days at that point- and she was fixated. In another 3 days, he was trying to get tips from us on how to end it.
Luckily we moved away before it all got ugly. And it did get very ugly, indeed. Last we heard, she had moved to Canada, gotten married, and was living there. I have no idea where she is now. I hope that she's still taking care of herself and not as crazy anymore.
More about the dead
Later I saw Carrie, and about died of fright in the end (the hand scene). It took me back to the holes in the cemetary. I wondered when I was little if they were put there so that the dead could talk to us through them. I walked quickly past them- I didn't want to hear their voices.
I have a fixation for cemetaries now. I really enjoy pretty ones with lots of trees and very old graves. I like to try and put together a mental picture of the families. In High School we jumped the fence into the cemetary next to the school during art classes to draw. It was just so quiet and such a mental distance from the school.
Interestingly enough, my Mother and Stepfather actually own a cemetary. It's the old Potter's field in the Helena Valley. It was part of his ranch, and can't be developed with the rest of the land. I got to see the chart of the graves once- it was interesting. I have never walked out there- it was where the cattle grazed, and that's a trecherous undertaking if there ever was one. I'm a little scared of being in the same area as a bunch of cattle. They are large in person, and don't seem very friendly.
Personally, I don't want to be planted in the ground. Never, never, never. I would much prefer to fertilize a garden (in ash form, of course, silly), or wash down a creek in Western MT. The idea of being in a box still creeps me out.

The morbid and the dead
You're driving along enjoying the view. And along the highway, are dozens of little metal white crosses. They mark where someone (or in the case of multiple crosses on a horizontal post more than one) died in a highway accident. There are places in MT where they are crazy thick. Gallatin Canyon is one of these. Around the Silos Bar outside of Townsend is another (we counted 12 of them in a 3 mile radius).
These things have always bothered me. Some service organization maintains and puts them up. Some families have turned them into ad hoc memorials. I think it's nasty. I don't like the idea of the place where I breathed my last in a violent way as being where I'm remembered. And then there's the iconography of the cross. They don't put up Stars of David for Jews. They don't put up crescents for Muslims. Nope. All get the cross treatment. I find that really offensive in a way. It's like baptizing dead people.
So if you're ever in the neighborhood, and you see plenty of these things, remember, it's a scary stretch of highway. If there's a bar nearby, you'll understand even more.

Our crawlspace
But our storage space is an oddity unto itself. There is an old window back there that was merely filled in with insulation. No serious construction was applied. Which, given other character-filled "features" of this place shouldn't surprise me in the least. What is a surprise is how often the neighbor cats dig their way through the insulation and into our storage space. We hear them, and evict them promptly. But it makes me wonder what happens while we sleep. Or while we're gone. Will they invite other cats over for a large party with our boxed junk?
I just keep reminding myself that it's just not my house. Then I don't care about the lack of level lines, extra holes in the wall, leaks in the bathroom, crazy placement of light fixtures, etc.
Girlfriends
Spouse has a new two-wheeled girlfriend. She is a vintage cafe racer. He loves her very much. It is still in the Honeymoon period- and she keeps spraining her ankle so that he will pay attention to her. I am actually pleased that he has something fun to do, what with the end of worrying about my unemployment and all. But it gets a little extreme on occasion.
I've warned him that she'll bring him heartache in the end. And that his loyal wife still needs to be kept in shoes and bon bons. I suspect, however, that he's filtering that last part out. He has the siren song of the open road in his ears.
Plus the Miata is in the shop being fixed after the birthday ruckus. They gave him a Ford Taurus (which I accurately predicted)- teal (which I also accurately predicted). And with this sex on wheels machine at his disposal, I can hardly blame him for fixating on something with a bit of intact thrill factor.

Another from the cast of characters
He was studying Medieval European History, as I remember. He was in his early 40s, and had a daughter. He wore wire-rimmed glasses in very poor repair, and had long stringy hair in a braid. He often wore baseball caps to cover the bald spot in front. He also didn't wash much, and was very smelly. He smoked hand-rolled cigarettes and had yellowed, long nails. His teeth were yellow. And they kept falling out. He would show up for seminars with one more gap in his mouth. I kept waiting for someone to ask him about it, but none of us dared. He was a sharp intellect, with a very dry wit.
He lived in a rented room downtown in the Eagles Building with a bunch of other single guys. They shared a bathroom per floor. I always imagined him as having a room full of moldering books stacked in teetering piles, empty beer bottles, cigarette butts, a stray tooth or two and plates of rotting food. He could put away pitchers of beer by himself at an amazing rate. All whilst prattling on about primary sources.
I heard later from a mutual friend that in his 20s he had been in Central America doing things for money that he wouldn't talk about very often. Kind of a soldier of fortune scenario. I heard that his teeth were damaged then. I do wonder whatever became of him. He didn't seem overtly tortured, just quietly so. I wonder if he's still in Missoula, having graduated to an apartment in the Wilma building, where he feeds the pidgeons on the window sill and looks out at the Clark Fork River in the evenings. And builds himself a shrine on the mantle using his remaining teeth.
Reading review
Blackberry pickin
Otherwise, not much happened today- except for day 2 of work, which went well. On the way in, I was behind a guy in a car- he was playing with his hair a lot while looking in the rear-view mirror. He kept fluffing it. I really wanted to shout,"Yes, you're a very pretty girl, Mary." But my window was up. I'll save that one for a rainy day.
At lunch I was wandering around towards Borders (no, the new F1 magazine wasn't in, dammit), and a crazy lady talked to me. I really should say that she either was talking to me, or her cane. I really couldn't tell. But it was ok, since she didn't seem to expect a response.
I think I'm going to enjoy working downtown. I am seeing a whole new world (cue the Disney track) It's new and exciting... chock full of corporate wonks, crazy people and just people in general. I'm digging it so far.

New job- recap
But I will say that I like the people quite a bit, and it feels good to learn some new things. And I'm bloody tired. That whole 8 hour stint without a good nap or movie in the middle is rough. I've gotten soft. I'm sure that the kitties are a little traumatized by the neglect, but I haven't asked them.
I'll write more tomorrow- I'm just tired as hell and need to not be at a computer for a while.

Eddies in the world
I have also run across his more twisted cousin- Crazy Eddy.
I met Crazy Eddy first. He lived in the dorm Freshman year. He was from Kallispell, and was seriously twisted. I kind of liked the guy- in a strictly platonic sense- he was funny as hell. I think he spent most of his youth running amok in the woods. He had that kind of mountain man/not well socialized where girls were concerned vibe. His college career came to an abrubt halt the first weekend before winter quarter. There was a party in his room. He was tanked. I walked in and he tossed something at me. I grabbed it out of the air, and started to shake. I knew what it was, but asked him, "Eddy, what is this?" He replied, "It's Jedomite." (He liked the name Jed for some reason, and carved it on desks across campus.) It was a stick of dynamite wrapped in plastic. I made him promise to put it in his desk and leave it there. Evidently he didn't remember his promise, because the FBI showed up the next day. He and the boy from the farm who brought it into the dorm were expelled. It was really quite dramatic. The last I heard, Crazy Eddy had joined the Army.
Fast Eddy was of a different ilk entirely. As unpolished as Crazy Eddy was, Fast Eddy was a booty call. I met him my Junior year, when a friend insisted that I accompany her to a Sigma Nu rush party. I didn't want her to go alone, so we went. I had a rule at those things- never, never get drunk and don't leave anyone behind. As things worked out, I didn't get drunk. But Fast Eddy was watching me from across the room. He invited me up to the chapter room (where they store the paddles and trophies- I'm not making any assumptions as to the proper use of either), and we made out. I wouldn't take it very far, and he got disgusted and we went back to the party. Then he denied that we ever met. Quite the gentleman, no? It got interesting when the friend I came with returned to the house a few days later. She was ripe for the picking, and spent the night with Fast Eddy. He came to the dorm for a repeat performance. Then he dumped her and never spoke to her again. She was silly enough to be surprised.
Whenever I smelled a nimbus cloud of Polo on the elevator, I knew that Fast Eddy was in the dorm. My guess is that he is an alcoholic who cheats on his wife.
So why Fast Eddy? And why Crazy Eddy? Why does Eddy get paired with adjectives so frequently? There was a Fast Eddy the other night on Reno 911. I don't think it was for the same reason.

Final story for the day
His name was Nick. He lived with his mother and crazy wife in a house right by the Orange Street bridge (he's not there anymore). He was a fixture of the place. He wore different hats with accessories depending on some internal calendar. One day he was a smelly explorer, with pith helmet and matching khakis. The next he had his top hat on and his stick.
He would go to the Top Hat and shoot imaginary arrows at people until he annoyed one of the surlier drunks and got beaten. He would wander around the streets at closing time and sing to people staggering home.
One day, I was working in a jewelry store downtown and he came in. He was in explorer mode, and very ripe smelling. He had a stack of photos that he wanted to sell. He said that they were worth millions. Each picture was a random shot of something on the street. He said that he had captured time in each one, and that they would never be repeated. He had a point.
He also told me about the painting he had done. It was in the window of the leather shop a couple of doors down. He was disgruntled by the lack of security. It was worth $100 million dollars, and belonged in the Smithsonian. But he wanted to share. It was of swirling waves and a pirate ship.
He painted a mural on the side of the bridge by his house. He landscaped a seaside scene in front of the mural of the ocean. It was creepy and lovely at the same time. It was totally daft.
His life was sad. He had been in the hospital at Warm Springs. That's where he met the wife. His mother received disability checks for all of them, and that's how they lived. She came into the store and returned a ring he had purchased for the wife once. They didn't have enough for heat in the winter, and she was ashamed.
I have no idea where he is anymore. I kind of hope that he lives near the ocean.
Second story
Anyhew- the landlady was a member of the largest landowning/realty family in Missoula. And a total crackpot. She had the large pine trees removed from the front yard of the place and proceeded to let the front yard become a weed nest. All while telling me about the improvements she was making to the place. The kicker was the day I got up and saw her in the front yard watering the weeds in her nightgown. This was on one of the busiest streets in town. She didn't live in the building either. She was talking to herself while she wandered around with the hose. Silly lady.
First story
There is a bar downtown called Charlie B's. Incidentally, both Spouse and I hung there A LOT in the years prior to meeting. I still can't figure out why we never met. Nevertheless, it was an odd place. I took my Mom and Stepdad there once- they were scared. But it wasn't really too bad- there were some derelicts there- but they left the college kids alone.
One night, Spouse (who for convenience I'll call K.) was playing pool. A man and his female companion came in. She was carrying a ratty little dog with a long chain. They took a table next to K's and she proceeded to laboriously wrap the long chain around Ray's chair. Ray took affront and yelled, "get the chain off of my fucking chair." She proceeded to laboriously remove the chain without saying a word. (Ray was kind of scary, so I can understand her reluctance to discuss it with him). She then sat on the floor with the dog cradled in her arms. The man she was with was in a jumpsuit. He approached the pool table and shouted incoherently at the players. He pulled a very large pipe wrench out of his back pocket and proceeded to hit himself in the head with it. Then he danced around and laughed. And hit himself in the head again. And danced around and laughed.
Finally, K and his friends finished their pool game, and the pipe wrench man was able to play.
This illustrates some key Missoula points. 1) there are a lot of really odd characters there. 2) people get used to them and don't really respond. and 3) the story is really funniest when K tells it- there is a lot of physical comedy involved.
But it did remind me of some kind of David Lynchian scenario.
Smells like feet
Spouse quoted a friend of ours once, and it really sums up the zeitgeist of the place- "Missoula is the town that woke up with its brakes on. But that's ok, it wasn't going anywhere."
People go there, and they stick. Even if they leave, they return like the swallows of Capistrano.
I was born in Helena, but spent the first 3 years of my life in Missoula. I went there for school and lived there for another 12 years. It broke my heart into little shards when I left. I haven't been that berift about moving away from someplace before or since.
My sister lives there now. I wish I was there. But the economy sucks, it's expensive to live there, and I'm out of school.
I can't very easily pull apart my affection for the place- I've tried. I am pretty sure it contains an essential element of nostalgia for my youth along with affection for the place itself. It's also genetic. Both my parents feel similarly about the place, or so they've said. It's the first place I had ever lived where I felt like I belonged.
It's also a prime freak magnet. I've told the story of the monkey man and his creepy-crawlin ways. There are more. I'll share.

We are all lucky
We are all lucky because it is Colin Farrell and not Will Farrell. Not that I don't find Will wonderful, but I never, ever, ever want to see his O face. Not Colin's either for that matter- but Will's would be scarier.

Shooting fish in a barrel
When I found this site with unicorn poetry(via some other site, I don't remember- possibly Gawker), I winced. These (and I'm assuming a lot, I know) women haven't gotten over their Unicorn phase. And don't look like they ever will. Creativity is good and all, but wow. I guess I never identified that closely with unicorns. Or pegasuses.
Oh happy day!
And it's our wedding anniversary today. 12 lovely years. Doesn't really feel like it's been that long, but it has.
And Lance looks like he's gonna win the Tour. Unless something really bad happens, that is.
And we saw Charlie and the Chocolate Factory last night, and I am pleased. Very Tim Burton, yes- but it fit the story rather well. He seems to really be drawn to the lost/alienated boy saga. It was cool to hear Roald Dahl's lyrics from the book put to Danny Elfman's music. But I did miss the original Veruca- she had moxie. The new Violet was Madonnaesque enough to really thrill me, though. And Augustus Gloop was missing his eyebrows- extra creepy!
We might just survive and thrive here. It is now more possible than ever. That's a strong sense of relief. I'm not sure though how the cats will respond to their abandonment. Will they lick bald patches on their tummies? Will they poop inappropriately in the shower? Will they continue to follow me around the house with imploring eyes (it's actually a combo of cute and creepy- trust me)? They seem to know something- they are both sitting staring at me. Oh right- they are hungry. Never mind.

Walking through the park and reminiscing
I was reading about the nanny vs. op-ed columnist wars yesterday. For some reason (about to come clear if you read on) the whole thing bugged the hell out of me. I don't really need to weigh in on who did the dumbest, nastiest thing in the battle- there's a good article on Slate.com about it if you're really interested.
But for the record, I've only blogged about a former employer once- and that was with some very heavy soul-searching on my part. I believe that discretion- paranoia even- is smart with the internet. I try very hard to protect my friends and loved ones and their privacy. Not to mention myself. So I don't expect to ever start blogging about work. Or at work. Neither seems like a good move.
And now on to why the story bothered me so much. Back in the day- right around the time I graduated with my 2nd and 3rd degrees, I was a research assistant for a famous woman. She was very celebrated in a field I was associated with. I was told on numerous occasions how lucky I was to have my position. I kept my opinion of that to myself then. It was really hard, though. The whole situation still leaves a bitter afterglow.
She was a mess. Emotionally, physically and spiritually (If I may be so bold.) Her spouse had died a few months before I started, and she was having serious problems coping. One of her kids had moved home after a nasty divorce, bringing a couple of very screwed up small children into the mix. There was absolutely no sense of appropriate boundaries. Anywhere.
I was being paid a pittance (trust me- chump change given the woman's net worth- and since I opened her mail, I knew what that was), and expected to babysit her, her grandkids, clean up from parties (that of course, I wasn't invited to), and research (as well as wrap Christmas presents and ship them, go to the ATM for her and numerous other crappy stuff). At the time I knew that it was stupid, but I didn't see a good out. And I didn't want her mad at me- I thought she could do some serious damage.
I discovered the mindset that I had never seen in my life- that of having hired help who are inferior. And I was that help. It really cut me to the core. I had been an RA for a couple of other people in the past and never felt this kind of disdain directed towards me. It was ugly. She went on numerous trips, and I kept the home fires burning. Luckily Spouse became my excuse to escape in the evening and go home. He made the mistake of coming up to her house once, and we wound up putting in a 16 hour day when she corralled us into babysitting duties. I felt much put-upon. And I do admit to not having a very professional attitude about the whole thing- I wasn't prepared. I didn't know that kind of situation existed.
So finally, when I found a stack of pornographic photos of her kid's ex-spouse on the hallway floor, I had had enough. It was too fucking creepy. And she hadn't even acknowledged Christmas- with card, gift, bonus- nada. That probably hurt more than anything else. So I basically told her that I would need to get a job that paid more, as I had to repay student loans.
She hired a couple of new chumps, and life went on. I felt lucky to have escaped. She didn't even mention me in the acknowledgements of a book I helped write. I stand assured that she probably doesn't even remember my name. The bitch. Yeah- I'm still bitter. And I have sworn to myself a couple of things- I will NEVER treat anyone working for me or with me with that kind of selfish disregard. I will always respect their boundaries. And I will NEVER be the "hired help" for some rich self-indulgent person again. It was a horrible experience, and I learned. And I'm thankful that it's over.
So yes, I have broken a rule about blogging about employers past. But I feel better for it.

And here's my final thought for today
I was thinking about how much ant and grasshopper (percentagewise) I and the people in my life are. Why was I doing this? I was trying to get to sleep, and these are the kinds of stupid things I do to achieve sleep.
I think I'm about 65% grasshopper. And Spouse is about 80% ant. Whether that's through actual proclivity or through actual necessity, I don't know. I just wanted to think about something inconsequential and stupid.
Eternally optimistic
And in the meantime, I listen to Sophia Choi acting all disgusted when talking about some fool in Australia who got his nose bitten off in a bar fight over the movie Sin City. She's all, "Can you belive this?" And I'm all, "Babe, you make a living reading a teleprompter about those kind of things. It's your bread and butter- and editorializing isn't gonna make you sound any more erudite."
Ha ha. And now for another hard cider. I've earned it. (or so I'll say.) I'll go out on the deck, enjoy the fresh sea breezes and watch the young roofers next door. They aren't wearing shirts. This could be better entertainment than Sophia Choi any day. Not to mention the goofy guy she's on the CNN with at the moment.
(it's probably a really good thing we have no tonic, or the Sapphire in the freezer would suffer for my sins.)
Gotta brag
But I pre-ordered my copy online and should get it today (I had a gift certificate- thanks Andrea!). In the meantime, my lovely Spouse was at Target Saturday morning, and bought me a copy. He is wonderful. I gave the redundant copy (with love, mind you- and after reading Chapter 1) to our lovely friend. And then another special person in my life sent me another copy. (I'll not give details there, thank you.) So all is wonderful in my Harry Potter world. I just can't read any of it this morning- or I might miss my interview. And that would be bad. I have a good feeling about this one. Let's hope it is an accurate good feeling, and not just moderately good health.
CNN highlight
They are planning on releasing a line of Napolean Dynamite action figures. I am wondering if they'll accurately portray that guy's package- you see, I hear that he's very impressive. I dunno for real, but I hear things.
One of them will be in prom regalia. One will be playing tetherball. And there are more, I guess but I wasn't paying very good attention at the start of the segment. I would suck as a reporter, I suspect.
Now I gotta go get ready for the job interview for this week. Send happy mojo my way, all! (Especially you, A.- congrats on the job, again!)

It's a Defamerific day!
· I saw Jay Leno at Pink’s Hot Dogs off Melrose yelling expletives (“Are you fucking nuts?”) at a teenager he found leaning against his car hood when leno returned from getting a dog. The kid apologized and Leno followed him for 20 yards screaming at him.
( I really wanna know what kind of car it was. Really. I would probably go batshit too if it was the right make and model.)
And another one from LA area kinksters
Does anyone want to come over and cuddle with me while we watch my videotape of Princess Diana's funeral? I also have extensive news footage of both the wreck in Paris and the weeping crowds in London. Then of course I have the entire funeral service itself, followed by the hearse's drive to her final resting place at Althorp. I'd love to watch this again while cuddling with a cute boy on the couch, eating popcorn and red vines, and maybe having a little JO fun if the chemistry is right. Send me a clear face pic and please be under 28. Thanks!

Today is a good day
And The Wedding Crashers also opens. I have a thing for those boys- Old Scool made me laugh so hard I cried. I adored it. It is a perfect double feature along with Office Space.
I just must remember to pace myself. Weak as a kitten, and don't want to wind up all prostrate on the fainting couch n all.

My interview- this time it's personal
Here.
So, let's play! Tally ho:
1. Seeing as you're from Seattle: Starbuck's - love or hate, or indifferent? Is the latte half-empty or half-full?
I'm new to the Seattle scene. Prior to about a month ago when I read that waiters/waitresses hated serving tea, I was a tea aficianado. And I was decaffed until about December. But now I drink coffee. And Tullys for me. Starbucks won't hire me, so I say fuck them. Unless they're reading this and reconsider the hiring thing. Then I'll be their bitch forever. And latte is always half-empty. The rest is milk.
2. What is your biggest fault? Answer the way you secretly wish you had been able to during that interview...
My biggest fault would probably lack of patience. I'm always looking for something to excite me, and move on once they get boring. And I am a silly optimist when it comes to thinking that things will be easy. Sometimes they are, but the job thing has kind of exposed the shortfall of that approach. And I get bitchy when people are slow. Driving in particular. Or in stores- or good God- art fairs. Women sauntering along with 20 foot wide strollers and fucking stopping- for no reason... I had better stop here- too many flaws- not enough time.
3. What is the strangest/most interesting thing you ever molded out of clay?
Clay is life. I did a series of pieces using porcelain that I devised a recipe for that were paper thin and looked kind of like flowers. It was the most demanding and fun thing ever. Until my glaze chemistry broke down and I opened a kiln at the end of the semester and found shards. The glaze had pulled the pieces apart. Luckily I had been successful earlier and had some pieces to show. But those were the best. I need a studio and some money to get rolling on those again someday.
4. If you had a clone, what would you do with it? Would you have sex with yourself?
I would send the clone on job interviews. That way I could blame someone else for not getting the job. And I don't swing that way, so no, I wouldn't have sex with my clone. I would teach her how to play cribbage (If I could remember how myself) and get good at it.
5. OK Miss Art History - if Mona Lisa could talk, what would she say??
STOP LOOKING AT ME!!! No- I think she would say, Leonardo, my darling, make me look pretty. It's hard to say whether or not it was a realistic or idealized portrayal of her. She might've had smallpox at some point and had the scariest skin possible. If so, then she was delighted with the results. I also don't know if this portrait was meant to snag her a spouse- if so, I hope it worked. I thought that there was still plenty of questions surrounding her identity, too- so I just dunno. She kind of gives me the creeps, though. I think it's the lack of eyebrows. And I think that Dan Brown is chock full of crap when it comes to the Da Vinci Code. I was disappointed in the ham fisted deneument of the book. But I think she would be pleased to be such a focus of attention after all of this time. And to be featured in a movie starring Tom Hanks.

Last night
Anyway, what seemed so riveting last night/this morning really wasn't, and I don't have much interesting to say today. Too tired. Gonna watch tivoed movies and nap.
Hooray!
And whatever. I don't give a shit. Really. I was totally faking it. Cuz I just felt like jerking someone's chain a little.
I'm not sleeping worth shit and am getting a leetle testy. Poor spouse took this week off for vacation, and hasn't had much fun with his wife. No going to museums. He's going solo. Poor boy. Blame the flu. And blame Canada. Why? Because they love hockey. And I like circular logic. It comforts me.

And finally, lest ye forget, MT is home to one of the world's largest nuclear arsenals. Here is one of them. I won't tell you where, but suffice it to say, this is not an uncommon sight thereabouts.
In Choteau you can buy Ice Cream- and dinosaurs! Seriously- who made that connection? It's either marketing genius, or just silly. And there are actually 2 Ice Cream parlors in Choteau. I don't quite get it.
On our trip- near the deathcar incident. Definately back roads of MT- very, very off the beaten track. The spots are kamikaze bugs.
Roadtrip pictures. This guy is an antelope (for those of you not familiar) and can run like hell. My Dad says that they'll run themselves to death- just cuz they're kinda dumb.

And just for fun
Mom said that he was very kind to his wife (?- did they actually get married?), and gentlemanly. She was impressed. I don't know what she expected, but she was impressed.
Anyhoo- celeb sighting of the week n all.
And furthermore
Or maybe I was just more of a wuss then. And Spouse saw it in High School. What a man he was! He was obsessed with Isabella Rosselini at the time, along with Louise Brooks. But he married a tall blond. I don't get it. But I'm sure as hell not complaining.
And he shares a birthday with David Lynch, and Federico Fellini. I share mine with Salman Rushdie. I love facts like that. Meaningless.
But yeah- Blue Velvet. Kyle was a pretty puppy. And overall, it's visually stunning.
Tomorrow I'm planning on watching The Young Poisoner's Handbook. Then I'll drift through The Story of Adele H. All in a good week's work.
Clowns to the left of me
Here I am- stuck with a fuckwit who doesn't actually have auto insurance- hitting our cute little car- on my birthday- and making my lovely Spouse all aggrivated. Lucky for us our insurance agent is wonderful (until we see this reflected in our rates, despite their assurances otherwise- call me jaded). But you can betcha that when and if I see that cockknocker again, I'll be giving him a blistering earful of venom.
There. I feel much better now. Thank you. Have a nice day.
Gotta love famous murder weapons.

Hacking up a lung
And my mind is churning around in circles. All seemingly prompted by those stupid yearbooks. Burn them...maybe an exorcism of sorts. But I've learned to regret impulsive actions that have that air of finality.
I've been reflecting on my secret life as a teenager. I was a feral little thing with a veneer of respectability that I was finally able to cast off in college. It's really quite good that I never dabbled in drugs until graduate school (and then only pot- and only for a very short time)- or I would've been lost, I'm pretty sure. And I only drank on 3 occasions in high school.
But then there was the bad part of growing up in a smallish town. Boredom. What do you do if you don't drink or do drugs? What if you don't have a large circle of friends to hang with? Well, I drove a lot with the few friends that I had. I put tons of mileage on the truck I drove. And since my dad paid for the gas, it wasn't a problem.
And then there were the boys. I seriously thought that I could escape it all through one of them. And there were a couple of very benign relationships in those years. But also a couple of very malignant ones too. The worst almost killed me. (literally in a sense, and figuratively as well) And the best made me stronger. But at the core was boredom. I probably wouldn't have been so immersed in all of that garbage if there were more to do in that silly little town. And I'll admit that I didn't take full advantage of the activities provided by the school- I just learned yesterday that there was an actual Latin Club. Who knew? I tended towards the solitary pursuits for the most part (that introvert thing again).
If we were to play the "Which character of the Breakfast Club are you?" game, I would say - Ally Sheedy. Only I talked a lot. And laughed a lot. And found almost everything funny.
More, more, more
I can't help but look back with a strange combination of sadness and envy. Sadness because I was such an unhappy thing at the time. And envy at the endless-seeming potential of that era in my life. I thought that I could do anything. Anything. And then I grew up. And learned that there are limits. And that this isn't necessarily a bad thing.
I also look at those pictures and wonder what became of some of them. Especially a few choice friends whose lives wandered away early on. I was a strange mixer back then. Drama, Art, Geeks and the stoner kids. I really didn't have much to do with the intellectuals- they were a little too into their alleged superiority. I really did like the stoner kids, though. At least the girls- most of the boys were kind of angry and edgy- and not very nice. But the girls were different. Damaged little things. I see that now. They were all going out with older guys who should've not gone there. And they all wanted salvation. One in particular was really great. But I didn't really pursue the friendship outside of school- her trajectory was sharply tilted downwards, and I didn't really want to go along for the ride. I do hope she's ok out there. It's a bad sign to be snorting Rush in study hall- and I picked up on that. But she was funny and sweet and sad.
We had an odd class. 5 of them died within the first year of graduation- several were suicides, and one was a homicide (according to some reports)/suicide (according to the police). And then one (a friend in Jr. high) died of brain cancer very young. And one drowned. I could've gone to my reunion and found out the rest of the stories, but I went to my sister's wedding instead. And was ok with that. The bitterness wore off so slowly- and bits are still there. I think I could handle it, but I don't really relish the thought of going back to where I was.
Spouse had several girls who wrote their numbers in his books. I didn't have that kind of thing going on. But there were entries that really illustrated that I was kind of a mystery to most of them. Probably because I was a combo of shy and extrovert. I would wear new wave regalia that made me stand out visually, but not really let anyone in to get to know me. I was terrified of rejection. And all of them. I wonder if I still am.

So last night
So it was odd seeing those faces. These people were my world. Some good, some rotten. And now some dead and some forgotten. I wonder if I would recognize any of them today. And vice versa. I must say that other than not having 80s puffy hair, and a few pounds on my frame, I don't look all that different (I think that not having kids has kept me pretty youthful). But I'm imagining that the guys that I thought were sooo hot back in the day might look rather nasty with extra poundage and less hair.
I spent time reading what was written in the books too. It made me kinda sad- I think that if I hadn't been such an angry, unhappy little wreck, I could've made better friends of some of those people. They were pretty nice. But at the time, I was very invested in the feeling of being the outsider. Thank God I didn't know about The Cure or The Smiths at that point- I probably would've been a Goth. And that would've been really rough.
It's just funny seeing all of those people who really, really mattered to me back in the day. I can't even remember many of them. Even past boyfriends. (some of those still make me shudder, though). I think that I was just too damned serious at too young of an age. Too intense. Too busy looking for someone to save me. Too lacking in the ability to not care.
No kitten for me.
I'm back, and it was fun.
It was good to get away from my job-free prison. And no, no good news yet on that front. I'm still waiting.
We did see something kind of nasty. We were driving the back roads from Billings to Helena (via Martinsdale on State Route 294, fyi) and saw a disturbing car wreck. We wouldn't have noticed the car on the other side of the road in the ditch on its top if there weren't 4 sheriff's cars there. And I knew that the Audi had at least one dead person in it- no one was trying to get someone out. That's a good indicator of that kind of thing. Spouse figured out the car type- the wheels. I didn't get a good look. Didn't want to see anything. But then we got the real confirmation that someone was good and dead. We passed the ambulance a bit later- dawdling along, without lights on. And that was that.
The next day at my Mother's ranch, we saw in the paper that a 22 year old guy from Clancy had wrecked his car at 4 AM the night before. We passed the scene around 10:30. So it took that long for them to discover the car. It made me very sad. I can only hope that he died quickly, and didn't suffer too much.
Friday, July 01, 2005
So screw em I say.
So we'll leave early tomorrow, and be gone until next week. I doubt that I'll be adding much here before I get back- Mom is on dialup. But I will have pictures!
Wing nuts on the wheel
So what has happened to our claim? Well it goes to arbitration. Yup. The companies are going to discuss it amongst themselves. And I might get to talk to investigators. Lucky me. I'll be nice, I promise. But I'll be quite clear. The bozo hit our asses. On my birthday. I hope he has bad dreams and hears my screams in his sleep. I curse him thusly.
Still no news
So we wait. Fuck them I say. I want to work, but I also want to be given at least 24 hours worth of warning that I have a job. Target is looking better and better every day!
Ok now I'm bummed
It's the Sandra Day O'Connor thing. It is really too bad. She's quite a person. And I've grown to really respect her. I think that one of the most admirable qualities about her career on the Supreme Court has been her insistence to actually cast her lot with whatever side she believed in, rather than being an empty-souled ideologue. She has integrity. And I might not agree with every decision that she made (eg. the election of 2000), but I do believe that she puts the Constitution first, and politics second on most things (with the exception of election 2000...sigh...).
The worst thing possible has happened, however. Not only is her husband sick- and I really do feel bad for her- that's really not good. But also, now our boneheaded President gets to choose a Supreme Court Justice. Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. Bet he'll choose a real corker. I thnk that we can look forward to some really nasty confirmation hearings. Y'all think that the current ones look nasty, just wait. I predict that he'll choose some right-wing wingnut with a serious anti-choice agenda. It'll only get ugly from there. And that makes me very sad. I hate what that man has done to our country- viz a viz the division of ideology. It really doesn't have to be that way. I am hoping that by the time the next election comes around, there'll be more incentive towards moderation. Yeah, and pigs will fly. But I can hope, no?
What It Is
The Atomic Shield Popper from Hog Wild is an innovative blaster that capitalizes on Hog Wild's classic ball poppers and adds rapid fire, multi-ball action. To load, simply put the six balls into the tube. Then pull back on the tethered ball, let go, and let fly. A built-in shield also deflects incoming fire.
Is It Fun?
This is a great way to encourage lots of active, creative play and a new twist on a classic play pattern. The package says it shoots up to 40 feet, but we were lucky to get half that on repeated trials. However, distance isn't what this is all about. It's about sneak attacks and blasting and all the kinds of wild games you can create with your friends.
One of the things that's smart about this toy is that the balls can be picked up by putting the opening of the tube on top of them and pushing gently. This also means that if you're running around with the blaster, the balls aren't going to fall out.
Who It’s For
The Shield Popper is for ages 4 and up.
What To Be Aware Of
While the box (and parents and us) warn against firing at someone's head, chances are some kids are going to play that way. While we always advocate being careful, the balls don't hurt when you get hit with them. They don't fire with that much force.
This is sold as a single unit, so you'll need to purchase a couple for blaster battles. Atomic Shield Popper from Hog Wild?Home/Current News

"GOP Congressional Candidate Says He Wants To ‘Choke Off’ Funding To Health Care Legislation"
Since Congress passed its health care legislation expanding health insurance to tens of millions of Americans earlier this year, leading conservatives have debated about the best way to oppose it. Some have advocated for simply repealing the entire bill wholesale, while others have argued for a “repeal and replace” strategy that would replace the legislation with a yet-to-be-determined conservative plan for health care.
Scott Tipton, the Republican candidate for Colorado’s 3rd Congressional District, is advocating for a third option: rather than repealing the legislation or replacing it with something else, he wants to “choke off funding” for the legislation, effectively stifling its effectiveness without doing anything to improve the U.S. health care. […]
Health-care legislation will cost $2.2 trillion over the next 10 years, Tipton said, and the only way to bring those costs under control is to cut them in the House, which controls the nation’s purse strings.
Tipton’s desire to “defund” health reform has previously been floated by Rep. Michael Burgess (R-TX) and Newt Gingrich.
Purely on the facts, Tipton is wrong to imply that cutting off funding for the recently passed health care bill would rein in the deficit. The bill already serves to cut the deficit, and repealing certain provisions or denying them the funds to be utilized would only end up costing the country more in the long run.
Putting deficit concerns aside, a far greater cost to denying funding for the legislation would be borne by the 3rd District Coloradans that Tipton is running to represent. As of estimates made in 2009, a quarter of the people in the district lacked any sort of health care coverage whatsoever. Hospitals in the district who have to care for these uninsured residents without compensation have calculated that they’ve paid “$94 million in annual uncompensated care costs in recent years.” When a surgery center in the district offered free care to residents one day late last year, people were so desperate to be able to be one of the few the center was able to take care of that some of them slept in its parking lot (less than half were actually offered care).
Thanks to Congress’s recently passed bill, an additional 106,000 district residents will be able to get insured and hospitals will be able to reduce the funds they spend on uninsured residents by $84 million annually. That is, if the legislation is fully funded. If Tipton gets his way, more than a hundred thousand people in his district will be unable to get health insurance, and hospitals will continue to expend countless tens of millions of dollars on caring for the uninsured.Daily Nebraskan editor Gibson selected for Fulbright to South Korea

University of Nebraska-Lincoln graduate Jenna Gibson, 2010-11 editor-in-chief of the Daily Nebraskan, UNL's student newspaper, will travel to South Korea to work as an English teaching assistant on a Fulbright Scholarship. She also plans to write for an English-language newspaper during her trip.
"I'm excited for the opportunity because I love language, gaining new perspectives and teaching others about my background," Gibson said, of Stillwater, Minn. She graduated May 7 with majors in news-editorial journalism, French and international studies, and a minor in Japanese.
Gibson became interested in South Korea and its culture last year when she was a Lincoln International Networking Community mentor. Her partner was from Seoul, South Korea.
"I've always kind of generally been interested in East Asia, but that was the first time I was interested in South Korea," she said. Gibson said her long-term goal is to work as a journalist with a wire service or a freelance journalist working in under-covered areas, like Africa, and Southeast and Central As."
Gibson has also already done some international reporting. She traveled to Africa twice with the journalism college. In 2008 she went to South Africa, where she wrote stories that became part of a photography book.
"That was an amazing experience because it fits right in with my career goals of becoming a foreign correspondent working in under-covered areas like sub-Saharan Africa," she said. In summer 2010, she went to Zambia, Ethiopia and Burkina Faso to write about a UNL agriculture project in those countries.
"Jenna is, above all else, a professional who cares about social justice issues and the world's have-nots," said Scott Winter, assistant professor of news-editorial.
The Fulbright scholarship will help Gibson reach her goal of covering international stories, Winter said. "She's had a lot of experience traveling and working here and there overseas, but this experience will embed her in a new culture, where she must live as it lives for an extended period."
On campus, Gibson spent most of her time working at the Daily Nebraskan. She wrote her first article the first week of her freshman year and ended her senior year as editor-in-chief. She was also involved with Nebraska Press Women and Multicultural students in Media within the College of Journalism and Mass Communications.
She spent two summers interning at the Stillwater (Minn.) Gazette and the Rochester (Minn.) Post-Bulletin. She credits her experiences in the journalism college and the Daily Nebraskan for preparing students to get the internships that give students "essential" real-world experiences.
"Working at the Daily Nebraskan gave me the foundation that helped me become qualified for other opportunities," she said.
Gibson is already working with English-language learners in Lincoln. She leads a class of English-language learners through the Lincoln Literacy Council. Adjusting to the culture will teach her how to be in a new place, just as if she was a wire-service reporter.
"I think it will be really important to be independent in a new place where I don't necessarily speak the language," she said. "I have to work on getting to know the people around me and integrating myself in a new community and learning about new people, new perspectives."
After her Fulbright trip, she plans to go to graduate school to study international relations. But first, she is excited to experience a new culture. "I think it will be very different, but that's a good thing for me," Gibson said.
She is the third announced Fulbright at UNL this spring, with more on the way. The announcements are made as the program notifies students of their selection. where the program operates. The Fulbright program is the flagship international education program sponsored by the U.S. government. About 8,000 grants are awarded annually, and about 1,600 of those grants are awarded to U.S. students.

This paper describes a knowledge-based system for molecular diagnostics, and its application to fully automated diagnosis of X-linked genetic disorders. Molecular diagnostic information is used in clinical practice for determining genetic risks, such as carrier determination and prenatal diagnosis. Initially, blood samples are obtained from related individuals, and PCR amplification is performed. Linkage-based molecular diagnosis then entails three data analysis steps. First, for every individual, the alleles (i.e., DNA composition) are determined at specified chromosomal locations. Second, the flow of genetic material among the individuals is established. Third, the probability that a given individual is either a carrier of the disease or affected by the disease is determined. The current practice is to perform each of these three steps manually, which is costly, time consuming, labor-intensive, and error-prone. As such, the knowledge-intensive data analysis and interpretation supersede the actual experimentation effort as the major bottleneck in molecular diagnostics. By examining the human problem solving for the task, we have designed and implemented a prototype knowledge-based system capable of fully automating linkage-based molecular diagnostics in X-linked genetic disorders, including Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). Our system uses knowledge-based interpretation of gel electrophoresis images to determine individual DNA marker labels, a constraint satisfaction search for consistent genetic flow among individuals, and a blackboard-style problem solver for risk assessment. We describe the system’s successful diagnosis of DMD carrier and affected individuals from raw clinical data.

Although extern(C) needs to be different between the systems, there's no reason for extern(D) to. Linux and Windows should use the same return algorithm for 1,2,4, and 8-byte structs. This is the only point at which the ABI differs (except for the fact that real.sizeof is different, but that's something dictacted by the OS). --- # For Windows, 1, 2 and 4 byte structs are returned in EAX. # For Windows, 8 byte structs are returned in EDX,EAX, where EDX gets the most significant half. # For other struct sizes, the return value is stored through a hidden pointer passed as an argument to the function. --- --

Nov 08 2010Bath and Body Works sales can be amazing. I went there over break and picked up some random stuff along with a room spray (since candle burning isn’t exactly legit in dorms). It’s lilac blossom. While lilacs aren’t my favorite flowers, I do really like them. Anyway, I just gave my room that smell, and somewhat unfortunately it’s making me rather nostalgic. You see, we have a huge row of lilacs right outside my room, and when they bloom we always have a big vase of them on the table. That’s obviously a spring tradition. However, it is January.
I got back to school yesterday and unlike home where we still have at least a foot of snow and the driveway = ice, there’s no snow here. Still some ice, but that doesn’t count. Basically, looking outside makes me think it’s March. I am glad to be back and excited about the class I’m taking for the next three weeks. However, there’s something about being home for a long break like Christmas and then leaving. I really can’t make up my mind though, because I don’t want the year to be over (and that’s what happens come spring). However, I don’t like homework, and I would love to be home. *gah!* How can I be so conflicted?
Well, I want to finish my homework for tomorrow before I work at 6:30. And I need to call my family again. There was a windstorm yesterday in my hometown that was apparently the worst storm in recorded history there. Some people we know had the windows of their house blown out, trees are down everywhere, and the power’s still out at my house. And there is another storm coming on Tuesday, I think. =\Right Now

Since the events that took place with singer Rihanna, his career has not had the snap, crackle and pop that it once possessed. To this day, it seems that Brown is still in the recovery stages with his career. So, when I heard about him having a video that fans would have to pay to see, you can understand my confusion. I wondered was that a smart move on his behalf, considering the recovery state his career is in.
Rihanna “Only Girl” Video Director Lashes Out At Fans
First of all, I do not know of any other major recording artists who have had a video which required fans to pay in order to view it. Secondly, I think Chris may be overestimating his appeal with fans and the public at large. Although, many have forgiven him and welcomed him back with open arms, there are still those who are not on team Chris Brown.
Which is why in my opinion a video that fans would have to pay to see is ridiculous. Especially when there are no other major artists who have already set this precedent. The pay per view would work as follows: Fans would go to mechanical dummy.com and pay $2.99 to watch the Pay Per View Event titled 12 Strands: Matrix.
Pre-Sale access will be available starting on Sept 24th. A percentage of proceeds from this project will benefit Brown’s foundation Symphonic Love..
Although I appreciate Browns intentions on helping charity, I do not think that the manner and venue he is choosing to facilitate that help will be appreciated by fans who simply do not want to pay to see a music video of any kind. Thoughts? Are fans ready to pay to watch a music video from Chris Brown? Was this a smart decision on Chris’s part?

The Case of the Perjured Parrot by Erle Stanley Gardner
Synopsis From Goodreads:....
As The Breaking Point was my last Mary Roberts Rinehart book of the year, The Case of the Perjured Parrot is my last Erle Stanley Gardner book of the year. Which means, for now, it's time to bid a farewell to Perry Mason. Hopefully he will be around next year as well, but if not, I will have this and the other books I have read over the last two years, to console me.
Little know fact about me, I hate birds. I'm not talking about loons, swans, eagles, falcons, or even ducks; you know the kind that stay outside, living their lives without much thought of when a human owner is going to feed them. What I can't stand are the birds that live inside the home; canaries, parrots, parakeets, or cockatoos. I think they are dirty, loud, obnoxious creatures, and I don't understand their appeal. My aversion to them is so great, that if this wasn't a Perry Mason book, I'm not sure I would have picked it up. By the way, I never said I was completely rational.
Because this is a Perry Mason book, I couldn't wait to dive in. There is something so raw and refined about Perry Mason, that I find the contrast to be rather appealing, especially on the page. The TV show version, though Raymond Burr did a great job, is just a little softer. Personally, I prefer the harder edge version, though they are both wonderful.
With The Case of the Perjured Parrot, Perry is confronted with a rather baffling case. First, he needs to figure out who Sabin's heir actually is, though the timeline of the divorce throws him off track for a day or two. Secondly, he is confronted with another timeline that just doesn't seem to add up. The timeline the police is offering off for when Sabin was killed, has holes in it the size of a bull elephant. It's up to Perry to figure out what really happened, and maybe who the killer is. Then there is the issue of the second wife, who Sabin seems to have married in Mexico. If a wife is going to inherit, which one should it be. It's when that second wife is accused of the murder, that things really start to get sticky.
The parrot, Casanova, is part of that stickiness. It keeps repeating a line begging Helen not to shoot. The problem is, the two wives, share the same name, Helen. Add in the fact that the substitute for the substitute parrot is found headless, and poor Casanova may be in real danger. I may not like parrots, but I'm pretty sure I would never behead one. Through some dirty tricks and legal maneuvering, Perry not only proves the innocence of his client, but unmasked the real killer, and reunites a newlywed couple.
For anyone interested, I found the TV episode on Bing. I couldn't figure out how to embed it, not sure that was even possible. But if you click on the link, it will take you there.

Vintage cover that is truly wonderful!! I'm so glad that you enjoy these books and bring them to our attention. Now, your aversion to inside birds is a little bit strange but I get it!!Daily Kos memberGive a gift subscription to this user

Six months after we said our “I do’s”, I was standing outside of the operating room at Vicente Sotto Memorial Center while my husband was wheeled into the operating chamber. It was the start of an agonizing six-hour wait after he would be wheeled out after his chest reconstruction surgery.
Ryan was born with pectus excavatum, also known as “sunken” or “funnel” chest, which caused him chronic problems with his heart and lungs. It has been a source of insecurity for him for as long as he could remember. That was about one of the few things I noticed last about him, since he made it a point to hide it with clever dressing and polo shirts. I told him onset that it didn’t bother me at all, and unless needed, he didn’t have to had it fixed.
Not much is written about pectus excavatum cases here in the Philippines. In the United States, it occurs in 1 in every 300 births, more predominantly in males rather than females, and comprises about 90% of chest wall deformities (reference here.) This condition can be fixed, however, it would take a great deal of resources to do so, starting with getting a good surgeon. Post-operation recovery would normally take around 6 months to a year, depending on the health of the patient.
In Ryan’s case, we had a pulmonologist assist us in coming up with the decision to finally have his operation. Ryan’s had asthma since he was a child, but starting November 2015, we were going in and out of the hospital due to pneumonia and bronchitis, which was draining us both physically and financially. We both decided that if a solution had to be made, we would go for a one-time, permanent solution instead of numerous temporary ones which would instead complicate and worsen his condition. After his last admission during January 2016, his doctor advised us that he needed the operation, since his CT scan showed that his left lung and heart were displaced between within his left ribs, which we surmised was the cause of his asthma, hypertension and tachycardia – which also, according to my research, were some of the sub-problems people having pectus experience.
We were briefed by the surgeon of the risks this would entail. His would be an uncommon procedure for pectus patients because his case was so severe that neither Nuss nor Ravitch procedures won’t permit (an index of 3 – 5 is okay for both procedures, Ryan’s was a 10, according to a resident who attended to him in the hospital). He would still have a metal bar placed in his chest, but it wouldn’t be taken out anymore. Bulk of the work wasn’t on the doctor nor the surgeon – he had to be brave enough to wade through the pain and breathe so his lungs would expand. His chest wouldn’t be perfectly un-sunken, but at least it would hopefully put an end to all these ailments he’d been having.
A million thoughts raced through my mind during that day. We were told that anything could happen – heck, the worse COULD happen. For every step of the journey, my only was prayer was “Lord, please keep my husband safe, please heal him completely. I leave everything up to You.”
He was finally wheeled out of the OR at 8:50pm and into the recovery room. The breath I was holding in whooshed out of me and had me feeling like a deflated balloon. I was tired, jumpy but at the same time relieved. The surgeon allowed me to see him, and after I was all scrubbed up, I stood at his bedside. His first words were, “Love, sakit,” (painful). I wanted to hug and kiss him, and tell him that everything is all right now, that it was over and he was going to be fine. By 4 a.m., after a series of x-rays and lab tests, Ryan was wheeled back to our private room. All was well.

Ryan had a total of five doses of morphine thru an epidural to help him manage the pain, along with tramadol. The resident pulmonologist advised us that he needed to breathe deeply, as much as he could muster, so his lungs would be able to adjust. Apparently, he wasn’t breathing enough because he developed respiratory acidosis on the 2nd day after his operation. This was the very reason why he had to breathe deeply, otherwise his body could not expel the CO2 that was pooling in his body. This was found out after the doctor ordered an ABG (arterial blood gas) lab test after she observed Ryan’s rapid shallow breathing, with his shoulders going up and down with every breath.
His results showed that his ABG had dropped to 7.2 that night (the normal level is around 7.3-7.5), meaning he had to have more oxygen to up his ABG levels. Which meant, as a measure to prevent a breathing tube from being placed, he had to wear a CPAP and had to be transferred to the ICU where he could be meticulously observed.
His time in the ICU were the longest three days of my life. If you’ve ever been to the ICU, you’d know that that part of the hospital is restricted to visitors, even to family, except for appointed visiting hours. For me, it was hard not to have to sneak in and see him, even for just a few minutes aside from visiting hours. I had to be content with just watching him from a window, without knowing how he was feeling – was he in pain? Was he hungry? Was he even still breathing?
February 22, 2016.
Ryan, being the fighter that he is, finally got out of the ICU that day with an ABG level of 7.4, three days after he was admitted in the ICU. I saw the positive changes right away – though he more often cringed because of the pain, and when his tubes were moved, at last he was becoming mobile, which contributed to his speedy healing. He was already sitting up, eating solid food by himself instead of just drinking Peptamen, and was going to bathroom with minimal help, slowly but surely.
March 1, 2016.
Finally, after two weeks, we were allowed to go home. He had a spirometer which he had to use to help his lungs expand, and initially we had to rent an oxygen machine to aid him whenever he was short of breath. After all, it was just less than a month after the operation and he was entitled to a few difficulties.
March 16, 2016.
It has been a month since he went under the knife. Since then, he has had a thorasynthesis to suction the pooled fluid and blood in his chest cavity, had both his tubes taken out, and is improving on his breathing, all in a span of one month.
My wholehearted thanks to everybody who were with us in our journey towards healing – my family and in-laws; the very competent team of doctors of Chong Hua and Vicente Sotto who tirelessly looked after Ryan and answered our questions, and to God, who I felt was always there, especially during those times when all I wanted was to sit down and cry my heart out of helplessness and anxiety.
I look forward now with renewed hope that I’ll be growing old with my pectus love. With or without his sunken chest, I love him just the same, and I thank God each day for giving me a strong – willed man as my lifetime partner. I couldn’t have prayed for someone better.
P.S. I am not a doctor, so please don’t substitute my word for a doctor’s consultation. I would, however, be glad to help if you need one, most specially for those living in Cebu or near Cebu.
This blog post is intended for those who have the same condition and is willing to go through the pain to get better. There is a way in which you CAN get better, if you WILL to get better. It’s quite pricey though, but if you opt to have it in a reputable public hospital, it wouldn’t damage your pockets as much as it would in a private hospital.

Hot New Photo Trend – ‘Surprise Face’ Replacing ‘Duck Face’ Photos
Why people can't just smile when they take a picture I don't know. At some point recently people decided that sticking out your lips when you take a picture was cute - we call it the 'Duck Face'. I'll admit that some people can pull off the duck face and look fine doing it...but for the most part it needs to stop! The good news is that it may stop soon thanks to the hot new photo trend - the 'Surprise Face'.
Do We Need An Asteroid Detection System
You guys remember the movie 'Armageddon' right? Ladies loved it and guys watched it because their ladies loved it. Pretty silly story though. Watch the movie if you want to know why I think it's silly (yes - just by watching it, you'll understand).
Brandon Chambers was a sophomore at VCU, in the middle of mid-terms season when on one particular night, he was staying up late, riding the high of the caffeine boost from his third cup of coffee. Chambers was a business major and was studying for a macroeconomics exam. However, instead of researching more about supply and demand, he instead searched for the email address of Anthony Grant, the school’s basketball coach.
“I could just remember sitting there at one in the morning as most college kids do studying for tests, overdosed on caffeine and I just sat there and thought to myself, ‘I can’t do this for the rest of my life,’” Chambers said. “I just wasn’t passionate about it.”
Immediately after this realization, he decided to take his chance and sent an email to Grant asking for a position as a student manager. By 6 a.m., he received a reply to meet in the office with the staff and graduate assistants. After meeting with the staff, they brought him on as a student manager.
Growing up, basketball had always been the sport that brought Chambers the most happiness. After school, he and his friends would always go to the local basketball gym to find a pickup game.
“That’s where I developed my love for the game, just getting with my buddies and playing the older guys or playing at another neighborhood,” Chambers said. “It was the type of thing where we’d get out of school at 2:15, we’d be there at 2:30 and wouldn’t leave until 7:30 at night.”
In his senior year of high school, Chambers had dreams to play collegiate basketball, but his father had just been diagnosed with ALS. In the event of an emergency, he wanted to be close enough to his family so that he could go home without a moment’s notice. Rather than trying to play in college, he instead opted to attend Virginia Commonwealth University, a school that allowed him to stay close to home.
As he continued his education at VCU to pursue his degree, he couldn’t suppress the itch to continue to be involved in the game. Thus, his position as a student manager gave him an opportunity to view the game that he loved from a whole different perspective, while still being close to home so that he could be proximate to family. It was a win-win situation that he could not pass up.
Little did Chambers know that his late-night email would turn into one of the most thrilling experiences for any college student.
After the Rams won the CBI Championship in his first season with the team, they doubled down and went on one of the most improbable runs in NCAA history as they went on to the Final Four, taking down powerhouses USC, Georgetown, Purdue, Florida State, and Kansas along the way.
Aside from getting a front row seat to one of the most memorable Cinderella teams, Chambers started to take on more responsibility. Under the direction of new head coach Shaka Smart, he was able to significantly further his basketball knowledge.
In addition, Chambers soaked up his knowledge from the rest of the star-studded staff who eventually became head coaches at their respective programs in Mike Rhoades, the current VCU head coach, Will Wade, who is the LSU head coach, and Mike Jones, the head coach at Radford.
“Late in my first year, going into the summer, the coaches would ask ‘Hey do you want to start coming around the office and helping with this?” Chambers said. “It was just very minuscule and minor job duties but those things start to add up over time to the point where they give you more and more to do.”
Misericordia & Marymount University
After graduating with his bachelor’s degree, Chambers pursued his MBA and began his career as a basketball coach. Following his run with VCU, he spent time at two Division-III schools, Marymount University and Misericordia University.
His role at the time was to be a jack-of-all-trades type of coach and learn all the facets of the profession, from doing menial tasks to analyzing film, to recruiting guys his age to come play for him.
“When people ask me what’s my background, I tell them that I’m a D-III hoops guy because in a Division-III level you’ve got to do everything and I was at that level for four years, learning under some of the best coaches I’ve ever been around in Trevor Woodruff and Chris Rogers,” Chambers said. “At the D-III level, you’ve got to fill the water coolers, you’ve got to make sure all the balls are out for practice. You’re doing everything because you have a smaller staff, smaller budget.”
It was a humbling yet transformative experience. In the mornings at Marymount University, he would go to work at 7 a.m. as an Admissions Specialist in the admissions office. In the afternoons and evenings, he would attend practice and afterward perform other coaching duties such as recruiting and game preparation.
As a grad student and assistant coach, late nights were aplenty when he would stay in the office until dawn. However, instead of pulling all-nighters for macroeconomics exams, he was instead doing it for something that he found genuine enjoyment from.
Chambers’ moment of epiphany was from a source that, like his impulsive email sent to Grant, came on a whim when he decided to call a childhood friend.
Steve Ware was an all-conference basketball player during his high school days but more importantly, was a close friend and fellow roommate of Chambers at VCU.
Since first meeting each other in their freshmen year of high school, they became inseparable. When they both ended up at the same college, the two decided to become roommates. However, while Chambers was diligently keeping up with his academics and responsibilities with the basketball team, Ware indulged more in the social aspect of college life.
With the level of friendship that they shared, Chambers reached out to Ware’s parents in an effort to reel him back on the right track.
”He told on me to my parents that I wasn’t really doing too well in school,” Ware said. “I was so mad at him for that to the point that I thought that we wouldn’t be friends anymore. However, when I look back on it, I’m really grateful for him for doing that because it helped me get on the right path. Only really good friends do stuff like that.”
The two went on different paths, with Ware spiraling out and going down the beaten path. He had dropped out of school by his sophomore year and went on to pursue less successful ventures.
After a short-lived stint with the military, Ware moved to Atlanta where he bounced from job to job, living from paycheck to paycheck.
In November 2011, he had barely missed a payment due for his rent and was evicted from his apartment. Ware had reached rock bottom.
Not five minutes after bawling from being evicted from his home, his cell phone buzzed. On the other line was Chambers, checking in on an old friend.
“It was probably the last phone call that I expected,” Ware said. “We always had each others’ numbers but I didn’t expect him to call because I’ve never called. I’ve never been the type to reach out like that and ask for help. It was almost like it was heaven-sent.”
Without knowledge of Ware’s financial situation, out of blind faith, he offered his friend an opportunity to play for him. Whether it be fate or an act of mercy or “Misericordia” from the gods, that call ended up becoming the turning point in Ware’s life.
Fast forward three months and Ware was a contributor for a team that reached two Division-III NCAA Tournaments. Fast forward to today, Ware has a college degree and is working on opening up his own music label and studio in Scranton, Pennsylvania.
According to Ware, his experience at Misericordia was what allowed for him to turn his life around. Being around influences like his head coach Trevor Woodruff and his childhood friend Chambers was exactly the push that he needed to take control of his life.
“Brandon Chambers cares about everybody else more than himself,” Ware said. “He is the type of person that has the attitude that if you’re willing to help yourself, he’s willing to help you. He taught me how to grind and that’s what I’m doing.”
The Coaching Clipboard
Being new to the game, Chambers realized quickly how he wasn’t much different from other young coaches in the coaching world in regards to things like player development, recruiting, or film breakdown. During his time at Misericordia, Marymount, and eventually Paul VI High School, he constantly thought of ways that could help him differentiate himself from all the other coaches in America.
One night, a friend of his commented on a basketball article that Chambers had posted to Facebook and encouraged him to continue to post similar material. Something about that comment flipped a switch internally and sparked an idea that helped connect him with Nevada Coach Eric Musselman.
For the greater part of four days, Chambers worked on aggregating as many emails of coaches at the collegiate level. From there, he decided to create an email newsletter that sent coaches plays of the day and articles that covered leadership, motivation, and coaching.
As the newsletter gained traction and replies from coaches, he decided to create a website called “The Coaching Clipboard”, a site where he continues to post regularly.
After the creation of the website, Chambers began receiving feedback and compliments from coaches from around the nation, one of them being Musselman.
“Our coaching staff would review the website and uses bits and pieces from his weekly e-mails,” Musselman said. “From the start, our coaching staff found Brandon extremely bright, insightful, and organized.”
After months of back and forth and towards the end of Musselman’s first year with the Wolf Pack, Chambers built up the courage to ask for an opportunity to work with the 51-year-old head coach, who had just won the CBI Championship. To his delight, Musselman was open to the idea of bringing him onto his staff.
Nevada
At the time that Chambers had been communicating with Musselman, he had left Marymount University to pursue a job at the high school level at St. Paul VI. It was a move in his career where he felt like he needed to continue to grow as a coach and as a person.
“People thought that it was a step back but it was actually a step forward for me,” Chambers said. “The cool thing that kind of hit me was you kind of get lost as a coach and you’re coaching these high-level players and you lose sight of the fact that they’re still 17 and 18-year olds and it was a really cool learning experience for me.”
Throughout his career, Chambers feels that he has lucked out in being able to work for coaches who were both excellent in their professions but more importantly, carried that excellence outside of the profession as people.
As an outsider who had never personally met with Musselman besides the on-court accolades that Musselman brought, he made it a point of emphasis to try and learn about Musselman as a person before making the decision to move to Reno.
“I could see how passionate of a coach he was, how detailed he was, how much about he cares about his players and his staff,” Chambers said. “You can learn so much about a coach in the post-game press conferences, through videos that are put out and on the Internet. After watching some of their games, the recap videos, or the different articles on the team, I could see where Coach Musselman was taking the program by how hard the team played and how much enthusiasm they had as a group. I could see his vision. It wasn’t necessarily a leap of faith for me, it was more me putting all my chips in and going all in on a guy who I saw all the success that he’s had in the past, saw the things he was going to do and following him throughout the year.I saw the culture and competitive program he was building.”
Thus, with an offer in hand from Musselman who he respects as a coach and person, Chambers packed up his bag and made the 3000-mile move to Reno.
Angrick
In the short time that Chambers has been in town, he has quickly grown to love the University, its people and its passion for basketball. Much like small town Richmond where his previous school VCU resided, Reno reminds him of all the things that made that Final Four-bound city special.
I tell people all the time, ‘I love Reno,’” Chambers said. “I absolutely love this city. Just being in Reno for the past year, I can tell that there’s a lot of people who love Nevada Basketball and are so passionate about it.”
One of those passionate fans is long-time Nevada Athletics Booster, Paul Angrick, who Chambers developed a special relationship with throughout his first year in Reno.
The two met after one of the Wolf Pack practices last season and quickly hit it off the bat. Small talk at practices turned into dinner invitations, which eventually turned into weekly rounds of golf during the weekends. It was a bond that developed into a father-son relationship wherein Angrick describes Chambers as a “third son”.
“My wife and I took Brandon under our wing and at the time he was a young man at 26, 27-year-old and he was 3000 miles away from his family in the east coast,” Angrick said. “We opened up our home to him and some of the other coaches and played golf with him on Saturday or whenever Muss would give him a few hours off. And he reciprocated in a way that I would never have imagined.”
In late February, with the Wolf Pack on the verge of their first Mountain West Conference Championship, Chambers and the rest of the Wolf Pack staff received devastating news of Angrick’s wife, Meg Cleary, passing away.
With the couple being incredibly close to the basketball program, its coaches, and players, the team decided to hold a pre-game tribute to Cleary on the night of their final regular season game, which was also the de-facto regular season championship game. For a long-time supporter of Wolf Pack Basketball, the powerful gesture helped him get through the beginning of what was an incredibly difficult time.
As the Wolf Pack went on to win the game and the championship, Chambers took the tribute one step further to help comfort his grieving friend. One by one, as the Wolf Pack players and coaches ceremoniously cut down a piece of the net and celebrated with the team, Chambers took his piece, handed it to Angrick, and said: “This is for your wife.”
For the grieving widower, that small act meant the world to him.
Two weeks later in Las Vegas, when Nevada punched their ticket to the NCAA Tournament, Chambers once again gave his piece of the championship net to his friend, dedicating his efforts to the couple who helped him find a home in Reno.
“To say it was touching is a grave understatement,” a teary-eyed Angrick said. “What Brandon did in recognizing her spirit was incredible.”
Those two pieces of net still sit on Angrick’s dresser to this day.
As Chambers embarks on his second season with the Wolf Pack and his first as the Director of Basketball Operations, he welcomes the challenge of the unique tasks that the role brings. While the challenges of the profession are what keep him consumed in his daily routine, Chambers is a reminder that coaching is just what he does and not who he is.
“Putting the basketball stuff aside, he is just a great young man,” Angrick said. “He’s smart, highly personable, he’s very engaging. What you see is what you get. For him, life’s more than just basketball.”All hotels in Macau, Macau

It’s time for someone else to run the RNC. … Steele’s poor performance as chairman has had one fortunate side effect -- it has created a robust field of alternatives. It gives us no pleasure to say this, but none of them would be worse than Steele, and we believe any of them would be better.”

SNEAK PEEK: With Christmas Eve fast approaching, Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) has said he will force the reading of the entire omnibus appropriations bill – any senator’s prerogative, but usually dispensed with through unanimous consent. Now, DeMint is prepared to play another card, per a GOP official: “If Dems attempt to ram through START treaty, DeMint will ask for the reading of the treaty as well. Could take about 10-12 hours.” DeMint wrote on National Review’s “The Corner” blog on Dec. 2: “will use every tool available to oppose an attempt to rush the debate over the START Treaty during this lame-duck session.”

Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.) is second in seniority on the panel … said she's running.”
--BEHIND THE CURTAIN, per a GOP aide: “To this point, Issa has played nice with Towns. What most people don't know is that for the better part of 2010, Issa has gone out of his way not to have confrontations with Towns in order to preserve their relationship. … Cummings will have one mandate: obstruct Issa. Don't think for a second [that] Issa will just do nothing in the face of such opposition. He has yet to show his combative side this Congress. For that, you have to go back to the Waxman days.”

TOP GOP DONORS VOW TO BOLT FOR OUTSIDE GROUPS IF STEELE WINS -- Jonathan Martin: “‘If Mr. Steele were to prevail, it will further alienate the party’s major financial supporters and most active fundraisers,’ said Wayne Berman, … who served as the McCain presidential campaign’s finance chairman in 2008. ‘His arrogant style, cult of personality and embarrassing mismanagement are sources of great discontent with the major fundraisers of the party.’ … Al Hoffman, a longtime GOP contributor in Florida who did two separate stints as RNC finance chairman in President Bush’s first term: … ‘The donor community has virtually no faith or confidence in Michael Steele’s to be the keeper of the keys. … I have a hard time finding any major donor who would trust him to straighten out the RNC and run a principled and ethical fundraising operation … My own slogan is now, Anybody But Steele.’ Hoffman said that, like Berman, he had been in contact with other fundraisers since Steele announced the news and that there was unanimity that a change was needed.”
--STEELE VICTORY COULD UNDERMINE 2012 CONVENTION: “Mel Sembler, another Floridian who also once served as the RNC’s Finance Chairman, expressed worry that if Steele continued atop the party it would make it more difficult for donors in the state to raise the $50 million needed for the GOP’s 2012 convention in Tampa. … Without the assistance of top donors, who can collect big checks and don’t require the overhead costs that go into raising low-dollar contributions, the party would have difficulty retiring what is at least $15 million in debt. … [I]t’s difficult to see how the RNC would function on a day-to-day basis if Steele returns. He’s already gone through a slew of staffers and he’s about to lose more. … Neither Mike Leavitt, the chief [of staff], nor Doug Heye, the spokesman, are [expected to stay]. Those left in the building say that the chairman has largely isolated himself from his aides and is relying on a handful of personal confidantes with little high-level political experience.”

(Associated Press)Nato's Anders Fogh Rasmussen sees power slipping away.
Talking on Monday to Anders Fogh Rasmussen, secretary general of Nato, he can see the reasons for austerity, for cutbacks in government spending in order to reduce deficits, but he can also see its likely results.
"It means," he says, "we will have less influence on the international scene. The vacuum will be filled by other powers and they do not necessarily share our interests and our values."
Many Britons or Americans still fuming at the destruction wrought in Iraq or Afghanistan may find a loss of influence preferable to a repetition of the past decade's adventurism, but it troubles many diplomats, soldiers and politicians deeply.
Indian nuclear submarines
General Sir Nick Houghton, the UK's chief of defence staff, said a couple of months ago that he had come to the "stark conclusion" that one of his biggest professional challenges "is to help re-validate the utility of the military instrument of national power in the minds of the government and the wider public".
It might be argued that a rejection of force by Western countries is a temporary phenomenon following the losses of two difficult foreign wars, and an economic downturn that has forced an emphasis on cutting deficits.
But the reduction of spending by Nato countries is just one aspect of this power shift - indeed it is the lesser aspect of it compared with the increases in military spending by countries like China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates.
In a survey to be published on Tuesday by the analytical company IHS Janes, it is estimated that defence spending by non-Nato countries will outstrip the Western alliance by 2021. The figures show that Saudi defence spending has tripled in the past decade and that China's spending will by next year outstrip that of the UK, France, and Germany combined.
Similar patterns emerge in the annual surveys of think tanks such as the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) and the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies, which will publish its annual round up of world military standings later this week.
The SIPRI data, which lags one year behind, shows that Russian arms sales increased markedly, by 28%, in 2012, and that much of this was attributable to increases in domestic defence spending. Western arms sales declined during 2012.
Along with the hardware comes all manner of indications of qualitative shifts in hard power. India is now launching its own spy satellites as well as nuclear submarines. The United Arab Emirates, long flush with cash but short of people to expand its armed forces, has recently announced that it will introduce national service to bulk up the ranks.
Somali pirates
Is growing spending by these economically powerful countries a zero-sum game? Does it have to rebound to the detriment of the West? Many feel that the erosion of US primacy in places like the United Nations Security Council may be a good thing, particularly if newly confident emerging powers are willing to share the burdens of international operations - as China has by sending frigates to counter Somali pirates.
It is, however, in the sensitive area of "interests and values" that Mr Rasmussen suggested that the concerns of many Western "securocrats'" now centre.
Russia and China, for example, have long stressed the need to respect the right of countries to deal with their own internal problems, rejecting internationally mandated intervention.
For those who believe in the ideas of humanitarian intervention and the responsibility to protect, the fate of Syria marks a grim portent of what these changes in the global realities of power might mean.Thousands of birds found dead on Chile beachesMay 12th, 2012 in Biology / Ecology

Data Collection and Analysis Using TRIPS The Falls Management Program Manual Key points in Chapter 3Importance of trackingDefining key indicatorsData collection and analysis using the Tracking Record for Improving Patient Safety1. Measurement SystemAn accurate measurement system is an important component of the quality improvement process that allows staff to determine if changes in care lead to improvement.The Tracking Record for Improving Patient Safety is the key tool used for measurement in the FMP, and replaces old incident reporting tools.The key indicators for the FMP are outcome measures that include falls, residents who fall, residents with two or more falls and fall related serious injuries (Figure 1). When studied over time, these key indicators are the best markers of improvement.Figure 1. Key indicators for the FMPNumber of falls each monthNumber of residents who fall each monthNumber of residents with two or more falls each monthNumber of falls with serious injury each monthIn addition to these four, there may be other important markers for administration and staff members to consider (Figure 2).Figure 2. Other indicators for the FMPFamily and resident satisfactionNumber of survey tags related to fallsNumber of lawsuits related to fallsChanges in staff awarenessChanges in staff organizationReduction of survey tags and lawsuits related to falls and injuries is desirable and a comparison of these indicators before and after program implementation will provide important information for facility and corporate leadership. Changes in awareness and organization cannot be measured in numbers, but it is helpful to obtain opinion-based information from staff, and to use their feedback in making program revisions. Perceptions of residents and family members are important indicators of customer satisfaction and should be used to evaluate the program as well. Specific process measures identified through chart audits during the FMP Self-Assessment can be targeted for improvement and monitored over time.2. Collecting and Using TRIPS DATAAfter evaluating and treating the resident immediately, the nurse should investigate the circumstances of the fall and look for all possible causes. The nurse should talk with the nursing assistant(s) who cared for the resident at the time of the fall and encourage full disclosure of the circumstances without placing blame. Even in "found on floor" incidents, staff should brainstorm together to determine likely causes. It is critical that investigation take place immediately so that valuable clues are not lost. "Unknown" should rarely if ever be used on a TRIPS form.All licensed nursing staff should be trained in the immediate fall response so that even on weekends, a detailed investigation, appropriate documentation and immediate interventions are done.Using the data recorded on the TRIPS form, it is useful to identify trends related to types of falls. Such details as location, time and activity may reveal that a large percentage of falls occur in one area, at one time of day or during a specific activity.Implementing the FMP will increase staff awareness and may prompt staff to report falls more accurately when administration uses a clear fall definition and develops a strong culture of safety. For this reason, there actually may be a rise in the number of falls reported during the first months after implementation. Normal variation in falls from month to month can be dramatic and it is better not to rely upon one or two months' data to detect change.3. Tracking Record for Improving Patient Safety (TRIPS)A copy of the TRIPS form should be completed by the unit manager or nurse supervisor at the time of each fall. Illustration of the TRIPS form with instructions for the completion of each section follows.A. Directions for completing the TRIPS formThe first section of the TRIPS form is a basic log that includes a general description of the incident, including severity level, treatment provided, persons notified and documentation methods. The nurse will write in the resident's name, medical record number, date the incident occurred and time of the incident, specifying AM or PM. The day of the week and location of the incident should be checked. When the location is other than the listed options or is unknown, the nurse should check "other" and write in a brief description. Treatment and resident outcome or "severity factor" should be checked. If a form of treatment was provided that is not listed on the form, the nurse should check "other" and describe it.The next items relate to notification of the physician and family and should include name of the contact and time and date of notification. The last 3 items ask if the appropriate actions were documented on the medical record and plan of care. The nurse should sign the form and write in the date the form was completed.B. Directions for completing Section B of the TRIPS formSection B of the TRIPS form contains 18 items and is used to document circumstances of the fall event (items 1-9) and resident outcomes (items 10-17).Circumstances of the fallItem 1 asks if the fall was witnessed or unwitnessed or if the resident was lowered to the floor by staff. If the fall was reported by the resident and was unwitnessed by staff, check "self-reported."Item 2 is cause of fall. If the resident slipped, the nurse should specify how this occurred. If there was equipment malfunction, the nurse should specify the equipment item and its condition. If an environmental factor was present, the nurse should specify if clutter, lighting, floor conditions, etc. were present. If the nurse cannot determine the cause after checking with direct care staff and examining clues at the scene, "other" should be checked and "unknown" written in the space provided.Item 3 is the activity at the time of the fall. If the resident is in a wheelchair at the time of the fall, staff should be trained to check if the brakes were locked. This should be recorded under "Getting up from chair/wheelchair." If the resident fell while getting in or out of the bed, the nurse should specify if the resident rolled out of the bed onto a mat and if the wheels of the bed were locked or unlocked. If the nurse cannot determine the activity after checking with direct care staff and asking the resident, "other" should be checked and "unknown" written in the space provided.Item 4 is staff presence at the time of the fall.Item 5 is the type of footwear the resident wore at the time of the fall. The nurse should check whether the footwear had tread or narrow/high heels as well as if the shoes or slippers were a loose fit.Item 6 is the assistive device or other aid used during the fall, if any.Item 7a-b is type of restraint in use, if any. Both restrictive and less restrictive forms of restraint should be recorded. If the type is not listed, the nurse should check "other" and specify.Item 8a-b is side rail use. When two full or four half rails were in use at the time of the fall, the nurse should check "full length side rails." If any other combination of side rails were in use at the time of the fall, the nurse should check "other" and specify the type.Item 9a-b is alarm use. First check if an alarm was present. Include alarms attached to a wheelchair and consider all types of pressure or position change alarms as well as room sensors. If an alarm was present, check whether it sounded.Resident OutcomesItem 10 is change in mental status.Item 11 is change in level of consciousness.Item 12 asks if the blood glucose level was checked and if so, the value. All residents with a history of diabetes should have their blood glucose level checked immediately following a fall.Item 13 asks if the resident's pulse was taken after the fall and if so, the value.Item 14 asks if the resident's blood pressure was taken after the fall. If so, the systolic and diastolic values should be recorded. For residents with complaints of dizziness or lightheadedness, history of recurrent falls or use of cardiovascular medications, postural vital signs should be taken and recorded beside postural BP. The resident's position during measurement should be checked.Item 15 asks if the resident's temperature was taken. If so, the value and whether it was oral, rectal or axillary should be recorded.Item 16a asks if the resident had an injury as a result of the fall. If so, the nurse should check the injury site and which side of the resident's body sustained the injury in 17B. In the next four columns, the nurse should check whether the injury was minor, involving a bruise, skin tear or abrasion, or was a major injury that involved laceration with sutures or a subdural hematoma, and if the resident experienced pain. If the resident's injury is not among the listed options, the nurse should put a check in the last column across from the injury site and specify the type of injury.Item 17 asks if the resident was in the Falls Management Program at the time of the fall. If not, the nurse should enter the resident into the program and proceed with the full Falls Assessment. If the resident was already in the Falls Management Program, the nurse should send the FAX Alert to the resident's physician with the current fall and the total number of falls sustained in the last 180 days.The nurse should complete the last item of the TRIPS form if, for any reason, the fall is not described sufficiently in items 1-17 and a narrative note would be helpful.

Discuss the new developments in Indo-Israel relationship under the backdrop of India’sdecision to abstain voting motion against Israel by the united nations human rights council and upcoming India’s PM visit to Israel in which he decided not to visit & meet Palestinian leaders. 7½ marks
3 thoughts on “International Relations”
1.India and Israel relationship at the backdrop of present scenario can be seen as an act of”lets publicly accept that we are friends”on the occussion of anniversary of 25 years of full diplomatic relationship between both countries .India is 2nd home for jews.cordial relation between hindu and jews is century’s old.
2.It is “Departure from past policy”.our goverment decided to bifurcate its relation with Israel and palestein.
3.It will further enhance the engagements between two countries on the issue under the” anti terrorism homeland security aggrement” which they signed few years ago. both face islamic terrorism as the jihadi element think both jews and hindu are two external element as envisaged in Quaran.
4.These ties further enhance “Make In India “initative by goverment of india which seeks two boost manufacturing in the country.there is already deal in defence,education and research work .now both countries decided to deveolo “surface to air missile system” for the army and it will be manufacture in india with 80% indigeneous content .
5.Israel seen it as a way to break the solidarirty for pleastein in South East Asia as India is influential and strong country in South East Asia .on the other hand India sees it as balance of power as the threats from China and Pakistan continue to increase from pas few years.so both contries knew that what they needs and will try to further intensift the diplomatic relation between them.
The answer has substance. You need to refine it. India’s decision in the past to support PLO was due to its commitment to the principles that a sovereign country, no matter strong or weak should not be overpowered by any other country. The shift in the policy is due to more emphasis over India’s twin goals- Development & Security by the present leadership. Diplomatic apprehension is there that it would send a wrong signals to the group of Arabic countries, particularly to united nations economic and social commission for western asia ( ESCWA ) which comprises of 18 Arabian countries.
The cost benefit analysis after Kargil war has driven India to redefine it’s relationship with Israel which is 3rd biggest arms/ related technologies supplier to India.
okk sir..i ll keep in mind.The cohesin network has an essential role in chromosome segregation, but also plays a role in DNA damage repair. Eco1 is an acetyltransferase that targets subunits of the cohesin complex and is involved in both the chromosome segregation and DNA damage repair roles of the network. Using budding yeast as a model system, we find that mutations in Eco1, including a genocopy of a human Roberts syndrome allele, do not cause gross defects in chromosome cohesion. We examined how mitotic and meiotic DNA damage repair is affected by mutations in Eco1. Strains containing mutations in Eco1 are sensitive to DNA damaging agents that cause double-strand breaks, such as X-rays and bleomycin. While meiotic crossing over is relatively unaffected in strains containing the Roberts mutation, reciprocal mitotic crossovers occur with extremely low frequency in this mutant background. Our results suggest that Eco1 promotes the reciprocal exchange of chromosome arms and maintenance of heterozygosity during mitosis.
Chromosome cohesion is essential to hold sister chromosomes together from the time they are replicated until the time they must be separated at the metaphase to anaphase transition. Cohesion is essential for the accurate attachment of chromosomes to the metaphase spindle and their subsequent division. Cohesion is mediated by the cohesin complex which consists of four subunits: Smc1, Smc3, Scc3 and Mcd1/Scc1/Rad21 (hereafter Mcd1). There are also several cohesin-associated proteins that are important for chromosome cohesion, including Eco1/Ctf7 (hereafter Eco1), an acetyltransferase important for the establishment of cohesion during S phase,1 and Scc2-Scc4, a complex required to load the cohesin complex onto chromatin.2
Mutation of human ESCO2, a human homolog of yeast ECO1, is associated with Roberts syndrome (RBS)3 and mutation of SCC2/NIPBL, SMC1 and SMC3 have all been associated with Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS).4–7 Together RBS and CdLS make up the cohesinopathies, which are human developmental disorders.8,9 Chromosome segregation defects are not a feature of these disorders. Instead, the molecular etiology is assumed to be related to non-essential functions of the cohesin network in gene regulation and DNA damage repair.10
Along with chromosome cohesion, the cohesin network has been shown to be involved in chromosome condensation,11,12 gene regulation,11,13,14 subnuclear chromatin organization,11,15 and double-strand break (DSB) repair.16,17 DSBs are a significant threat to genome stability and can arise from endogenous and exogenous sources such as collapsed replication forks and exposure to ionizing radiation. In most eukaryotes, DSBs that arise during S-phase or G2/M are repaired by homologous recombination (HR). HR repair of DNA damage requires an intact, homologous DNA sequence to serve as a template and during mitosis this is often the sister chromatid resulting in genetically silent repair.
When a DSB is induced by the budding yeast site-specific endonuclease HO in G2/M, cohesin binds to the region surrounding the break18,19 in an Scc2-dependent manner.20 Human cohesin has been shown to interact with Rad50 and accumulate in regions of laser-induced DNA damage during S and G2 phases in a Rad50/Mre11-dependent manner.21 Furthermore, cohesion is reinforced genome-wide in G2/M in response to a single DSB. This process is dependent on the acetyltransferase activity of Eco1 and is referred to as damage-induced cohesion.20,22 Reinforcement of cohesion in response to DNA damage has also been shown to occur in human cells.23 One target of Eco1 for damage-induced cohesion has been proposed to be Mcd1, although acetylation of Mcd1 has never been directly demonstrated in vivo.24,25 Acetylation of the cohesin subunit Smc3 has been shown to be critical for S phase coupled cohesion and is dependent on Eco1 in vivo.26–28 Acetylation of Smc3 by ESCO1, a human homolog of yeast ECO1, has also been shown to be important for the DNA damage response in human cells.23 Additional Eco1 targets have been shown in vitro29 but their biological significance is unknown.
Eco1 has two primary domains, a zinc finger in the N-terminus and an acetyltransferase domain in the C-terminus. The mutation W539G has been shown to abrogate acetyltransferase activity in the context of ESCO2,30 a human ortholog of yeast ECO1, and this mutation is associated with RBS.3 Cells from RBS patients are sensitive to the DNA damaging agents mitomycin C, camptothecin and etoposide, while no particular sensitivity to UV, ionizing radiation, hydroxyurea or aphidicolin was found.30,31 In budding yeast, mutations in the acetyltransferase domain have been shown to strongly reduce acetyltransferase activity in vitro29 but do not cause high rates of chromosome loss.32 In contrast, mutations in the zinc finger (C35Y, H53Y) have some acetyltransferase activity in vitro but still have very high rates of chromosome loss.32 The zinc finger enhances the activity of Eco1 for cohesion, but is not essential for interaction with chromatin or protein targets.33
DNA breaks caused by X-ray treatment persist in backgrounds containing mutations in the cohesin network,17–19 suggesting the damage is not efficiently repaired. Somewhat paradoxically, it has also been shown that damage-induced cohesion is not required for intrachromosomal gene conversion of an HO break or the 5′ to 3′ resection of this break.18 Marker loss at the RDN1 locus, which is likely due to intrachromosomal or intersister recombination in a haploid, is similarly unaffected by mutation of the acetyltransferase domain of Eco1.11 Thus, the exact molecular role of cohesion in DSB repair remains mysterious. One prevailing idea is that cohesin is involved in the process of selecting the sister as a template for repair, but this is unsupported by experimental evidence. The effect of cohesion on recombination between homologs has never been explored.
We examined how mutations in Eco1 affect interhomolog recombination in S. cerevisiae. We demonstrate that the W216G mutation is a phenocopy of the human RBS mutation in that it eliminates acetyltransferase activity in vitro. Using various measures such as in vivo acetylation of Smc3, precocious sister separation and DNA damage sensitivity, we compare four different mutations in Eco1. We then use the RBS mutant, which shows limited precocious sister separation but obvious damage sensitivity, to examine the effect on recombination. Following bleomycin treatment, we find a strong deficiency in reciprocal crossing over during mitotic growth, which is needed to maintain heterozygosity. In contrast, we find only subtle defects in meiotic recombination. These results imply that an Eco1-dependent process is needed for specific recombination outcomes, e.g., reciprocal mitotic crossing over, but not for others, such as break-induced replication, gene conversion or meiotic crossing over.
We tested three different mutations in Eco1 for their effect on chromosome cohesion: (1) eco1-H53Y, which is expected to disrupt the zinc finger, (2) eco1-ack (R222G, K223G), which disrupts acetyltransferase activity and (3) eco1-W216G, which corresponds to the W539G mutation associated with Roberts syndrome (Fig. 1A). Chromosome cohesion was examined in the Eco1 mutant strains in nocodazole-arrested cells using GFP marked telIVR (Fig. 1B), an arm location on ChrIV (Fig. 1C) and cenIV (Fig. 1D).34 Nocodazole arrests were verified by cytometry. While the eco1-ack strain shows no defect in cohesion, the eco1-W216G mutant has a mild defect in cohesion and the eco1-H53Y mutant has a moderate defect in cohesion. The cohesion defect in the eco1-H53Y mutant is consistent with the report of elevated rates of chromosome loss in a zinc finger mutant.32 However, this effect (15–20% precocious separation) is not as severe as other mutations that can cause as much as 80–90% loss of cohesion. At 37°C, the eco1-W216G strain shows 65% loss of cohesion.11 The eco1-1 allele confers severe cohesion defects at 37°C, but also has cohesion defects (~8% higher than WT at CenV) even at the “permissive” temperature of 22.5°C.1 Because this mutant is very temperature sensitive, its phenotype is somewhat difficult to compare with eco1-ack, eco1-W216G and eco1-H53Y, which have a permissive temperature of 30°C.
In order to compare the acetyltransferase activity of different Eco1 mutants, each mutant protein was expressed in E. coli and purified via a GST tag. Recombinant protein was incubated with 3H-acetyl-Co-A and a recombinant Mcd1 peptide (amino acids 169–337). As had been previously shown, the eco1-1 (G211D) and eco1-ack mutations strongly reduce both autoacetylation of Eco1 and acetylation of an exogenous substrate.29 The Eco1-W216G mutant protein behaved similarly. In contrastt, the H53Y zinc finger mutation results in a protein that retains some auto-acetyltransferase activity, but has a similar deficiency to the other mutants in terms of acetylation of an exogenous substrate (Fig. 2A). This protein might be expected to have low acetyltransferase activity toward its targets in vivo. Similar results were obtained when acetylation was detected by western blotting with an anti-acetyl-lysine antibody (data not shown). Thus, all four mutants have severely compromised acetyltransferase activity toward a target protein in vitro.
We next checked the expression of the mutants in vivo by adding a 3X FLAG tag to the C-terminus and immunoblotting. We find that Eco1-W216G and Eco1-H53Y are present at much lower levels than wild-type protein (12-fold and 6-fold, respectively, Fig. 2B). Regrettably, a strain bearing FLAG tagged Eco1-1 is inviable, so we were unable to measure the level of this mutant protein in vivo. The lower levels of the Eco1-W216G and Eco1-H53Y protein in vivo combined with the lack of acetyltransferase activity measured in vitro suggest these mutants might have a stronger phenotype than eco1-ack, whose levels are only reduced ~2-fold.
Given the differences in protein levels, we decided to measure the acetylation levels of Smc3 in each mutant background in vivo in order to determine their “true” acetylation defect. Acetylation of Smc3 can be detected with an anti-acetylysine antibody when the cohesin complex is immunoprecipitated from whole cell extracts. We examined Smc3 acetylation using immunoprecipitation of either Smc3-HA or Mcd1-18Myc. Smc3-HA in combination with the eco1-H53Y mutation is lethal so we could not perform the HA immunoprecipitation in this strain. We found that the level of Smc3 acetylation in eco1-ack is nearly wild-type, while the level in the eco1-1 is the lowest. Acetylation is present at intermediate levels in the eco1-H53Y and eco1-W216G mutants (Fig. 2C). The level of acetylation measured in either the Mcd1 or Smc3 pull-down is similar. In addition, each of the pull-downs was performed at least twice with similar results. Unfortunately, the level of acetylated Mcd1 cannot be measured in vivo since it is not detected with any of the available anti-acetyl-lysine antibodies.24 Although acetylation of an exogenous substrate is undetectable in vitro, these mutant Eco1 proteins mediate various levels of acetylation in vivo.
Given the role of the cohesin network in DNA repair, we examined the different mutants for damage sensitivity. The scc2-D730V mutant strain used in this assay corresponds to a mutation associated with a second cohesinopathy, Cornelia de Lange syndrome. Since both the eco1-W216G and scc2-D730V mutations have been reported to affect chromosome compaction, the scc2-D730V mutant is meant to serve as a control for any effect of chromosome compaction on damage sensitivity. The scc2-D730V mutation does not cause a measurable cohesion defect.11 A rad50Δ mutant serves as a radiation sensitive control. Deletion of RAD61/WPL1 has previously been shown to rescue the growth of eco1-1 at 37°C and damage sensitivity associated with the eco1-1 mutation.27
We examined the sensitivity of the eco1 mutants to different DNA damaging agents. Hydroxyurea (HU) will slow S phase which in turn causes collapsed and stalled replication forks. X-rays and bleomycin will primarily cause DSBs, which can occur at any point in the cell cycle. The eco1-1 mutant strain is sensitive to HU, bleomycin and X-rays. We find that none of the other 3 eco1 mutants nor the scc2 mutant display sensitivity to HU, but eco1-H53Y and eco1-W216G are both sensitive to X-rays and bleomycin (Fig. 3). The D730V mutation in SCC2 does not cause sensitivity to DNA damaging agents. As previously shown, the eco1-W216G mutant does not grow at 37°C,11 but growth is rescued by deletion of RAD61. In contrast to what has been reported for eco1-1,27 deletion of RAD61 does not rescue the damage sensitivity of the eco1-W216G strain. Deletion of RAD61 alone causes very mild DNA damage sensitivity, consistent with a previous report.27 Similar results for all mutants were observed in an S288C background (data not shown).
In order to pinpoint the relevant acetylation target of Eco1 for damage sensitivity, we tried to genetically rescue the damage sensitivity by overexpression of known targets. Acetylation of Mcd1 is thought to be important for cohesion following a DSB in G2/M,25 although this post-translational modification has never been detected in vivo. Expression of Mcd1 with mutations that mimic acetylation (K84Q, K210Q) bypassed the need for Eco1 for DSB-induced cohesion.24 Smc3 has also been shown to be acetylated by Eco1 for S phase cohesion on residues K112 and K113.26–28,35 We investigated whether overexpression of MCD1, MCD1K84QK210Q, SMC3, SMC3K112QK113Q, SMC3K112NK113N, SMC3K113Q or SMC3K113N would rescue the damage sensitivity of the eco1-W216G mutant strain. We found that overexpression of MCD1 or MCD1K84QK210Q did not suppress the growth defect caused by X-rays (Fig. 4A). Neither didt overexpression of SMC3 or any of the SMC3 mutants (Fig. 4A). In conclusion, overexpression of no single known target of Eco1 was able to rescue the damage sensitivity of the eco1-W216G mutant strain. This result suggests that the expression of the acetylation mimic mutations may not sufficiently mimic the acetylated state or that Eco1 may have additional targets for DNA damage repair.
In contrast to the DNA damage sensitivity, overexpression of SMC3K113Q or SMC3K113N, but not SMC3, rescued the temperature sensitivity of the eco1-W216G strain. The rescue suggests that the primary reason for lethality at 37°C, which is correlated with a strong cohesion defect,11 is a deficit in acetylation of K113 in Smc3 by Eco1. These findings echo the rescue of the eco1-1 strain with SMC3K113N.27 Overexpression of SMC3K112NK113N or SMC3K112QK113Q actually inhibited growth of the eco1-W216G strain, suggesting that the constituitive acetylation of both residues is problematic, similar to findings in a previous report.26
As a control, we overexpressed ECO1, which allows robust growth following treatment with X-rays, as expected. Unexpectedly, overexpression of Eco1-W216G rescued the temperature sensitivity of the eco1-W216G mutant strain (Fig. 4A), suggesting an abundance of Eco1-W216G is sufficient for its essential function in chromosome segregation, but in contrast, it did not suppress the damage sensitivity. Western blot analysis showed that the eco1-W216G mutant protein is expressed at high levels (Fig. 4B) and furthermore, that the acetylation of Smc3 is restored by the overexpression (Fig. 4C). Thus, neither the restoration of acetylated Smc3 nor the expression of the Smc3 acetylation mimic is able to rescue the damage sensitivity of the eco1-W216G mutant.
In order to further characterize the DNA damage defect in the Eco1 mutants, we analyzed checkpoint function in the mutants. The sensitivity of eco1 mutants to DNA damage may result from either a failure activate the DNA damage checkpoint or an inability to repair the damage. In budding yeast the effector kinase, Rad53 (Chk2) is required for checkpoint activity and cell cycle arrest in response to DNA damage.36 Rad53 becomes phosphorylated by Mec1 in a Rad9-dependent manner in response to DNA double strand breaks.37 We monitored cell cycle progression and the phosphorylation state of Rad53 following exposure of cells to X-rays (Fig. 5).
Rad53 was efficiently phosphorylated following treatment with X-rays in the eco1-H53Y, eco1-W216G and eco1-ack mutants, but only the eco1-H53Y and eco1-W216G mutants held a persistent arrest in G2/M, similar to a rad50Δ mutant (Fig. 5). In contrast, the eco1-ack mutant behaved more like WT; it did not arrest, suggesting it could efficiently correct the damage. This observation supports our finding that eco1-H53Y and eco1-W216G mutant strains are more sensitive to genotoxic stress than eco1-ack (Fig. 3). A rad9Δ mutant serves as a control; Rad53 is not phosphorylated in this mutant and cells do not arrest.38,39 We conclude that the checkpoint is appropriately activated in the mutants and the sensitivity to ionizing radiation is due to a downstream defect. This observation is consistent with damage-induced cohesion being dependent on Mec1.22
While mutations that reduce the acetyltransferase activity of Eco1 have little effect on S phase cohesion and chromosome segregation, the same mutations (eco1-ack, eco1-203) have been demonstrated to reduce DSB-coupled cohesion in G2/M.22 Unfortunately the eco1-W216G mutation in combination with the mcd1-1 allele used in the assay developed by the Koshland lab to measure damage-induced cohesion is a lethal combination so we cannot measure damage-induced cohesion in this manner. However, since the Roberts strain is damage sensitive, we decided to study how this mutation affects recombination outcomes in a diploid background.
An elegant system has been developed to analyze mitotic recombination in a 120 kb interval on chromosome V.40 This system takes advantage of a variety of heteroallelic selectable markers. One copy of chromosome V contains HIS3, can1–100 and HYG while the second copy of chromosome V contains LEU2, SUP4-o (an ochre suppressor) and KAN at the same positions. The background is homozygous for the ade2-1 allele, which contains an ochre suppressible mutation. When ade2-1 is suppressed by SUP4-o, cells are white, but if the cells lack SUP4-o, they will be red (Fig. 6A). This strain can be used to score break induced replication (BIR), local gene conversion (GC), reciprocal crossovers (RCO) and chromosome loss events.
Previously, mitotic recombination following growth on HU was examined.40 HU increases the number of recombinants approximately 40-fold over the rate of spontaneous mitotic recombination. When the rate of recombination is high, recombination events do not need to be selected. The number of sectored colonies relative to the total number of colonies is a direct measure of the frequency of recombination. After the two colored sectors are isolated, these colonies can be further scored for the various markers to differentiate types of recombination events.
We grew the diploid WT and eco1-W216G mutant strains on plates containing 2.5 µg/ml bleomycin to induce a low level of damage. At this concentration, the eco1-W216G mutant strain can still grow whereas at higher levels, its growth is significantly impaired (Fig. 6B). Individual colonies were resuspended in water and plated to nonselective medium (SD-arg) and screened for colonies with red/white sectors. We find that growth on 2.5 ug/ml bleomycin elevates the rate of recombination in a WT strain approximately 120-fold compared to no treatment. Both RCO and BIR events are stimulated on bleomycin in a WT strain. However, with HU the ratio of RCO to BIR events is approximately 0.6:1,40 while growth on bleomycin causes RCOs to become more common than BIR events with a shift in the ratio to 1.8:1. This is likely related to the different types of damage caused by HU and bleomycin. The overall rate of recombination in the eco1-W216G background appears slightly lower than wild-type (p = 0.08, chi square test, Fig. 5C), suggesting the mutation may compromise recombination efficiency.
Sectored colonies were scored to assess what type of recombination event had occurred. For the WT strain we examined 11,340 total colonies and found 18 with the phenotype expected for RCO events and 10 with the phenotype expected for BIR events. For the eco1-W216G mutant strain, we examined 24,489 total colonies and found 6 with the phenotype expected for an RCO event and 32 with the phenotype expected for a BIR event. The drop in RCO events in the mutant background is statistically significant at the level of p < 0.0001 using a chi square test with Yates correction. Three independent trials were performed and the standard deviation is shown (Fig. 6C). Chromosome loss events were not significantly elevated in the Roberts mutant background, arguing that chromosome segregation is not defective and consistent with the 1 spot-2 spot results (Fig. 1). The specific effect of the eco1-W216G mutation on reciprocal crossovers implies that Eco1 activity is needed for this particular recombination outcome in mitotic cells. Interestingly RCOs seem to be particularly important for mitotic repair at the rDNA.41
The reduction in reciprocal crossovers during mitosis prompted us to examine the level of crossovers in meiosis in the Roberts mutant background. In meiosis, programmed DSBs elevate the frequency of recombination 1,000-fold. In addition to the markers already described, the strain used was heterozygous for URA3/ura3-1 within the 120 kb interval on ChrV and for TRP1 inserted at the TAR1 locus within the rDNA (Fig. 7A). We wanted to monitor recombination within RDN1 since this is a cohesin binding site.42,43 In mitosis, the cohesin complex consists of Smc1, Smc3, Scc3 and Mcd1/Scc1. In meiosis, there is a second cohesin complex in which Rec8 replaces Mcd1.16,44 In contrast to Mcd1, Rec8 cannot mediate damage-induced cohesion.25 Whether or not Eco1 has essential targets in meiosis is an open question.
We examined the meiotic products from a WT strain and a Roberts mutant strain. Tetrad formation is reduced in the Roberts mutant relative to the wild-type. Furthermore, spore viability is reduced from 96 to 75%. However, recombination as scored in 4-spore tetrads is indistinguishable from WT. Although the frequency of aberrant segregation for four different markers is elevated in the mutant, these increases are not statistically significant (Fig. 7B). If aberrant segregation is summed for all the loci, the increase becomes statistically significant with a p value of 0.012. Genetic distance, which is a measure of the number of crossovers per kb, is similar for three different intervals (Fig. 7C). Thus, it seems that Eco1 activity is not essential for successful meiotic recombination or crossing over.
We have analyzed and compared four mutations in the essential acetyltransferase ECO1; each mutant has a distinct phenotype. Together these mutations can be thought of as a series of weak to strong hypomorphic mutations. Three mutations are in the acetyltransferase domain and one is in the zinc finger; all four mutations cause deficiencies in acetyltransferase activity in vitro, including a mutation that corresponds to the human Roberts syndrome mutation. Despite similar deficiencies in acetyltransferase activity in vitro, strains with the mutations integrated under the control of the endogenous promoter display different levels of Smc3 acetylation in vivo and these levels roughly correlate with sensitivity to agents that cause DNA damage, with the eco1-1 mutant being the most sensitive, eco1-W216G and eco1-H53Y displaying intermediate sensitivity and eco1-ack showing no detectable sensitivity. Since acetylation of Smc3 is necessary for cohesion, the number of cohesive complexes is likely to be reduced in the mutants. Reducing acetylated complexes may be akin to systematically reducing Mcd1 levels, which has recently been argued to reduce the number of cohesive complexes.45 In this case, accurate chromosome segregation required much less Mcd1 than DNA repair,45 which is consistent with our findings that reduced Smc3 acetylation in the eco1-W216G mutant does not affect chromosome segregation but this mutation does affect DNA repair.
Growth at 37°C in the eco1-W216G strain was rescued by overexpression of ECO1-W216G, SMC3K113Q, SMC3K113N or deletion of RAD61, suggesting these genetic manipulations are sufficient for chromosome segregation. In contrast, none of these genetic manipulations was able to rescue the damage sensitivity, suggesting none of these genetic states are sufficient for an effective response to DNA damage. It is possible that the overexpression of ECO1-W216G, SMC3K113Q or SMC3K113N failed to rescue the damage sensitivity because acetylation is uncoupled with the damage response.
Given the DNA damage sensitivity of the eco1-W216G strain, we undertook a detailed characterization of recombination in this mutant background. The mutant displayed a surprising defect in reciprocal crossing over, suggesting that an Eco1-dependent process is required for the exchange of homologous chromosome arms. This defect may be due to a reduction in damage-induced cohesion. The specificity of the effect for mitotic recombination probably reflects the different roles of cohesin in the repair of mitotic DSBs and the programmed DSBs that occur during meiosis.
When DSBs are repaired by non-reciprocal recombination, such as BIR, instead of reciprocal crossovers (RCO), such as in the RBS mutant strain, the net result is a greater chance for loss of heterozygosity (LOH). Although crossing over is a rather rare event during mitosis, mechanisms to ensure reciprocity are quite important since they allow for the maintenance of two copies of a given allele, rather than a conversion to homozygosity. Retinoblastoma, a human cancer of the retina, provides a compelling example for the importance of maintenance of heterozygosity. When one parent's contribution of the tumor suppressor Rb1 is flawed, this almost invariably results in childhood retinoblastoma due to chance LOH events. Thus, discovering mutations that lead to a bias toward LOH is informative since it identifies a potential mechanism by which LOH can occur. In budding yeast that have been aged by multiple passages, the rate of LOH increases due to a bias toward non-reciprocal recombination,46 similar to what we observe in the RBS strain.
An E. coli culture was grown in 1 L of LB with 100 µg/ml ampicillin at 37°C until OD600 was 0.3. Then the culture was shifted to 25°C and continued to grow until OD600 was 0.6. IPTG was added to 0.3 mM for 3 hours at 25°C. The cells were subjected to centrifugation at 5 K, 4°C for 5 min and washed with cold PBS. The pellet was resuspended in 30 ml metal lysis buffer (25 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol and 1 mM DTT) with protease inhibitors (Roche). Then 0.5 ml of 500 mg/ml lysozyme was added and mixed by inverting. The mixture was incubated 10 minutes on ice and sonicated on ice 5 times for 30 seconds on 35% power with a 2 minute interval. The lysate was then centrifuged for 20 minutes 16 K at 4°C and was then further centrifuged at 50 K for 45 minutes. The supernatant was added to glutathione resin and rotated for 2 hours at 4°C. The glutathione resin was rinsed with 5 ml metal lysis buffer and protein was eluted by adding 1 ml of 10 mM reduced glutathione.
Purified GST-tagged Eco1p WT, G211D, R222G K223G, W216G and H53Y proteins (0.4 µg) were added to HAT buffer (50 mM Tris [pH 8.0], 5% glycerol, 0.1 mM EDTA, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF and 10 µM 3H-Acetyl-CoA) and incubated with GST-Mcd1169–337 (1 µg) for 60 minutes at 30°C. Reactions were run on SDS-PAGE and analyzed by both Coomassie staining and exposure to a Phosphor screen.
The cell pellet from a 200 ml culture grown to OD600 = 0.8 in YPD was lysed in NP40 Lysis Buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10% Glycerol, 1% NP-40) by the addition of glass beads and beadbeating for 60 sec 5 times with 2 min intervals on ice. The supernatant was collected and the protein concentration was determined using the optical density of a standard curve and Bradford reagent. 50 µg of total protein was loaded onto a 4–12% Bis-Tris gel for SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane followed by blocking. For detection of Eco1-FLAG, α-FLAG antibody (Sigma #F3165) was used at a 1:2,500 concentration followed by α-Mouse HRP (GE Healthcare #NA931V) at a 1:5,000 concentration. For detection of overexpressed Eco1, polyclonal α-Eco1 antibody was used at 1:1,000 followed by α-rabbit-HRP (GE Healthcare #NA934V) at a 1:5,000 concentration. Smc3-HA was pulled down from whole cell extracts using anti-HA beads (Roche) and eluted using SDS buffer (10 mM Tris pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 1% SDS). A cocktail of deacetylase inhibitors (100 µM Trichostatin A, 50 mM nicotinamide, 50 mM sodium butyrate) was added during the immunoprecipitation process. The eluate was subjected to SDS-PAGE. Following transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane and blocking, α-acetyl-lysine antibody (Cell Signaling #9441) was used at a 1:1,000 concentration followed by α-Rabbit HRP as above. Detection was achieved with Amersham ECL Plus western Blotting Detection System (GE Healthcare #RPN2132).
To detect phosphorylated Rad53, 75 µgs of protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Following transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane and blocking, α-phosphoRad53 antibody (Santa Cruz, SC-6749) was used at a concentration of 1:1,000 followed by α-goat-AP (Promega, V1151) at a 1:5,000 concentration. For signal detection, BCIP (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate) was used in conjunction with NBT (nitro blue tetrazolium) for the colorimetric detection of alkaline phosphatase activity in the presence of alkaline phosphatase buffer [100 mM Tris-HCl [pH 9.0], 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2].
Yeast strains (Table 1) and tetrad analysis were constructed and analyzed by standard methods.
The cohesion assays were carried out as previously described.11
The assay to select and analyze reciprocal mitotic crossovers has been extensively described.40
The cohesin complex ties sister chromatids together from the time they are copied until they are separated into two new cells. Cohesin is evolutionarily conserved from yeast to man. While cohesin is critical for chromosome segregation, it also plays a role in DNA double-strand break repair. Eco1, an acetyltransferase, regulates the complex. We used budding yeast to study how mutations in ECO1 affect the DNA damage response. A mutation in ECO1 associated with Roberts syndrome caused a deficit in the reciprocal exchange of homologous chromosome arms. This type of recombination outcome is considered beneficial since it promotes heterozygosity of alleles.

I am a Life Scout who has been working toward Eagle Scout, the highest honor in the Boy Scouts of America, for almost two years.
Eagle Scout represents the culmination of the Boy Scouts’ finest achievements. The focus is on service and leadership, with the most important and well-known requirement being to “plan, develop and give leadership to others in a service project helpful to any religious institution, any school or your community.” To put it simply, the Eagle Scout rank provides the opportunity to give back to others.
For my Eagle Scout service project, I chose to erect a monument that I designed in front of my hometown’s city hall in Dardenne Prairie, Missouri. It is meant to honor the men and women of all five armed service branches of the U.S. military.
When selecting my project, I wanted to pick something that I was passionate about, so I thought back on my past. There has been one thing in my life that stands out more than anything else. For most of my life, our country has been at war. The events of 9/11 and the War on Terror have played a large role in shaping the modern century, as well as our daily lives. When I was younger, my father and I approached men and women in uniform and thanked them for their service. It is now a tradition in my family to thank Servicemembers, no matter where they are—at the airport or a restaurant, or even if we’re just taking a walk.
I was two years old when 9/11 occurred and too young to completely understand what was happening. My mom and dad said there was a bulletin that warned parents not to let young children watch the coverage, because kids couldn’t understand that the events of 9/11 weren’t actually occurring every time the news stations reran the horrific footage. My parents did a good job of shielding me from those scenes, but one day when they were watching TV, I came up behind them as the news was showing the planes crash into the buildings. When I saw it, my first response was “Uh-oh.”
The idea for a monument came to me when I studied sculpture in art class and earned the Boy Scout Sculpture Merit Badge. Both of these factors added the final piece to the puzzle; however, I still had to put it all together. In 2011, when I attended a 9/11 remembrance ceremony in a neighboring town, I thought that my community needed something to honor the members of the military so that we could show our appreciation for what they do. That’s when it all came together.
I worked with Dardenne Prairie Mayor Pam Fogarty, the city’s past and present Board of Aldermen, and an exemplary monument company in Seattle called Quiring Monuments. The original price of this project was quoted at about $20,000, but through changes in the design and the generosity of others, the price came down to slightly more than $18,000. A bronze military seal—one for each branch of the military (Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines and Coast Guard)—was placed at the top of each side of the black granite obelisk. The monument is topped by a bronze eagle with its wings spread. Artist and sculptor Cathy Erdmann was commissioned for this beautiful piece.
I have met many Veterans of the recent wars in the Middle East, as well as those who served in Vietnam, Korea and World War II. I’ve spoken at Veterans of Foreign Wars halls and American Legion posts and have made the acquaintance of many great people. When I started this journey, my mission was to “honor the men and women of all five branches of the U.S. military, both past and present, for their bravery, dedication, service and the sacrifices.” They make it so that we as Americans can enjoy the freedoms we have today. OUR FREEDOM IS NOT FREE. That is why the first and biggest “thank you” at the monument’s dedication and unveiling ceremony, May 24, 2014, went to all those who have served and are still serving—because who they are, and what they fought and continue to fight for will never be forgotten.
Bryan recently finished his freshman year at Barat Academy, where he played on the Boys’ Varsity Soccer and Junior Varsity Golf teams, as well as participated in the Spring Musical. Bryan crossed over into Boy Scouts in 2010. He has held several leadership positions throughout his scouting career. He enjoys earning merit badges and going on troop outings, and is looks forward to experiencing high-adventure camp at the Philmont Scout Ranch in New Mexico later this summer. He would like to thank his friends, family, Troop 984, the Boone Trails Eagle Board (especially those members who approved his project at his first Board of Review), the City of Dardenne Prairie, Lisa Nealey and David Quiring of Quiring Monuments, and Mr. Gene McCallister, a Vietnam Veteran who is his Eagle Mentor and guide along the trail to Eagle Scout.

Zito pitched 8 1/3 scoreless innings, scattering four hits and striking out five, while Joaquin Arias and Melky Cabrera provided the run support with RBI singles as the Giants blanked the Chicago Cubs, 2-0 on Sunday afternoon. Zito (5-2) continues to be one of the most consistent pitchers in the Giants rotation, winning three of his last four decisions and pitching at least seven innings in four of his 11 starts. Travis Wood was the tough-luck loser. pitching seven innings, allowing only a run on three hits with seven strikeouts. Leading 1-0 in the eighth, Gregor Blanco walked with one out. Ryan Theriot flied out, but Cabrera, one of the hottest hitters and leading the Majors in batting average and hits, delivered a single to left to score Blanco from first base. Zito went out for the ninth inning but was lifted after giving up a one out walk to Darwin Barney. Starlin Castro struck out and Alfonso Soriano grounded out against Sergio Romo who got the save. The game was scoreless until the bottom of the fifth. Wood retired the first 10 batters he faced. He was working on a no-hitter when he gave up a one-out double to left field by Angel Pagan. After Hector Sanchez struck out, Arias came through with a single to right scoring Pagan on a play at the plate, but the ball bounced and got away from catcher Koyie Hill. Zito pitched out of a jam in the fifth inning. With one out he gave up two hard-hit singles up the middle to Ian Stewart and Reed Johnson. He managed to escape without damage when Hill struck out swinging and Stewart was thrown out on the play trying to steal third for the inning-ending double play. The Giants threatened but failed to score in the bottom of the seventh. Buster Posey led off the inning with a double to left center but was stranded. Wood intentionally walked Arias to face Brandon Crawford, who flied out to shallow center to end the frame. NOTES: Pagan has a 27-game home hit streak, which is a franchise record, breaking a tie he held with "Turkey" Mike Donlan, who had a hit in 26 consecutive home games for the New York Giants from Aug. 28,1905-May 5,1906. ... The RBI single by Joaquin Arias ended an 0-for-18 slump at the plate with a runner in scoring position. ... 13 of the next 19 games for the Giants are against teams with losing records. ... The Giants have not hit a home run at home in their last 12 games, longest streak since AT&T Park opened in 2000. It ties the record of 12 straight games without a home run since May 18-June 18, 1980. ... The Cubs have lost 15 of their last 18 games.

It’s a common characteristic of the way we work, so it makes sense to be prepared for these tiring periods in advance. That way, when it’s two hours past your normal leaving time and there’s still no sign of getting home for the evening, you’ll be able to power through without producing substandard work. And the best way you can maintain your energy over days like this is to make sure you’re looking out for yourself from minute one.
This is achieved by creating a prioritized schedule. List down each task and sub-task that you need to complete, and figure out an order than enables you to get the most urgent and most difficult stuff done first – before your brain starts to slow down! Beginning with smaller tasks (if they happen to be important ones) can also be useful if you are a natural procrastinator: that way, the first leap is much easier to take.
Your schedule should allow for regular breaks. It can be a tough discipline, on a busy day, to force yourself to rest. That’s why it is very helpful to use an app such as Break Timer to remind you when each hour comes around. Taking even a 30 second break can improve your productivity by 13% – so it is worth doing, even if your logical mind reckons that working straight through will get more done.
These breaks should not be seen as an opportunity to catch up with your online life. Emails are a legitimate part of work, but they can take over the rest of your day if you allow them. Instead, mark a specific part of your schedule for dealing with messages, switch your notifications off, and keep your phone hidden from view as even the sight of this temptation can be distracting.
Instead, consider using your break to do some stretches. Stretching can boost the flow of oxygen to your brain, and keep your limbs supple – ideal when you’re working a long, mind- and derriere-numbing day at the office. If you’re short of room, there are plenty of exercises you can do without leaving your desk. A good one is to lean forward and pull each of your legs up and back towards your chest for around 30 seconds at a time.
If coffee is your fuel, you might be interested to hear about Dave Asprey’s so-called ‘bulletproof coffee’. The self-styled biohacker reckons that adding two tablespoons of unsalted butter to your cup of Joe can help to achieve mental clarity when you’re up against it. At the very least, it provides a curious alternative on a long day at work when the kettle is your only friend!
If that sounds a bit hardcore, you can at least use your coffee break as an excuse for a change of scene. Instead of returning to your trusty kettle, try moving your operation to a nearby coffee shop for an hour or so. A fresh environment can improve your creativity and concentration: it could be just what you need when your willpower is diminishing.
Drink nothing but coffee all day, however, and you’ll soon find yourself dehydrated and underperforming. If coffee is a useful tool, plain old water is a vital ingredient for success. Allow yourself to dehydrate, and you’ll feel a lot more tired a lot more quickly. Keep track of how much water you’re drinking all day long, and that way you can pre-empt disaster by topping yourself up before you start to get low.
There are plenty of less intuitive tricks you can try to help keep your energy up when you’ve been at it all day. Working while standing up can put you in a better mood and boost your brain power, according to experts. Listening to new music can keep your environment feeling fresh and your brain active – just don’t play it too loud! And working near a window can help you absorb daylight and fresh air, which should keep you feeling more awake than being sequestered away in a dusky corner.
Finally, don’t neglect the power of peppermint. A splash of this essential oil on your wrists, or kept open on your desk, can be great for your levels of awareness. And it’s probably a heck of a lot healthier than coffee and butter!
So keep these tips in mind ahead of your next deadline push or all-nighter. If you work together with your mind and your body, it is amazing what you can achieve. These tips have been gathered into a handy new infographic so you can refer back to them whenever you need that extra boost – because sometimes, our schedule is boss and we have to find a way to get things done..Eclipse Community Forums - RDF feed Eclipse Community Forums "execute all" always splits up statements at semicolon <![CDATA[Hi all The command "execute all" always breaks statements at semicolons even when it should not.

The Russ Tee is an even-toed ungulate that thrives on good quality music. It belongs to the Dance subfamily (House), along with thirty-two other species of musk funk including deep, chunky, vocal, disco, and bass-driven beats. The male Russ Tee can develop a shaggy beard when left unattended which contains yearly growth rings. Its hearing is protected from the elements by using custom-made earplugs during Spring/Summer, when the Russ Tee molts by rubbing against rocks, trees and anything that moves.
Daily movements reflect its foraging, resting and thermoregulation needs; primarily in areas of the same suburb, drainage basin, or region. Seasonal movements primarily reflect nutritional, reproductive (known as ‘tupping’), and climatic influences. In general, movements are likely to exhibit a strong nomadic component, consisting of coastal beach breaks around Sydney used during the Spring-Summer to coincide with High Flyers boat parties.

This extraordinary offering just hit the market.
This property is a quite unique and private one in Cambridge (Photo Provided by New England Floor Plans & Photography).
The idea of living in a garage may be just about the least appealing thing you can think of until you see this property. Originally commissioned by a family with three kids, this home used to be a commercial garage but has been converted. What would have been a wall of garage doors is now a wall of glass windows. This is accented by a large, bright area, thanks to a section of the building highlighted by a sunroof.
Though the living room certainly stands out with interesting ceilings and incredible flooding light from the wall of windows, the other rooms in the house seem more natural. “Now you would look at the rooms as standard, and its just the mindset,” says Hammond Real Estate listing agent Christian Jones. “Now, with how we’ve embraced luxury, people are going to want to move some things around, maybe dedicate some space to the master suite, or maybe enlarge either the shared bath or the bedrooms.”
In this property there is a great deal of square footage to work with, so it is a malleable space that you can be put to any use and renovated in many ways, while still maintaining the architectural purity.
Though this property is located at the summit of Avon Hill and just a short distance from Harvard and Porter Square, it feels set off on its own. “You have to walk into the yard to feel the seclusion of it,” says Jones of this intriguing properties. “It’s one of the few properties in Cambridge that you just can’t see from the street; you have complete privacy.”

Directed by Luis Buñuel
Mexico 1965, b/w, 45 min.
With Claudio Brook, Silvia Pinal, Hortensia Santovana
Spanish with English subtitles
Buñuel’s final Mexican production, Simon of the Desert is a darkly humorous parable about the life of an obscure saint who achieves new heights in his asceticism by perching in the desert atop a tall pillar. Simon’s faith prevails in the face of assaults and temptations, and he begins to perform miracles for his dubious new disciples. A final miracle of sorts is performed by the Devil, who liberates the ascetic to that hell on earth known as New York City.
Directed by Luis Buñuel
Spain/Mexico 1961, b/w, 91 min.
With Silvia Pinal, Francisco Rabal, Fernando Rey
Spanish with English subtitles
After years of exile Luis Buñuel returned to his native Spain to make this dark account of corruption. Viridiana was produced with the blessings of the Spanish government and under the scrutiny of its censors, but only after its release did Franco’s regime realize the film’s meaning, and promptly banned it. Sylvia Pinal gives a superb performance as Viridiana, an idealistic young novitiate who visits her uncle (a closet transvestite) and tries to help some local peasants and beggars, but Viridiana’s virtues lead to terrible misfortunes. The final beggars’ orgy, a black parody of the Last Supper performed to the ethereal strains of Handel’s "Messiah,” is one of the director’s most memorably disturbing, wickedly humorous scenes. Winner of the Palme d’Or at the 1961 Cannes Film Festival, Viridiana welcomed Buñuel back to the center stage of world cinema.

Directed by Satyajit Ray
India 1971, b/w, 112 min.
With Barun Chanda, Paramita Chowdhury, Sharmila Tagore
Bengali with English subtitles
The second film in Ray’s Calcutta Trilogy, Company Limited reflects the social and political mood of the times. While political violence is kept largely in the background, the film’s protagonist, a rising young executive in an electric fan factory, struggles with his ambitions and the corrupt choices that make him company director. Accusations that Ray’s films were politically insensitive seem misplaced when considering this shrewd satire of the American-styled business world of Calcutta. Its realist depiction of the new urban culture recognizes the prices that culture extracts, while maintaining the humanism which Ray demonstrated in his renowned Apu trilogy.

UK 1966, b/w, 93 min.
With Pauline Murray, Sebastian Shaw, Bart Allison
English and German with English subtitles
It is the Second World War. The Nazis have invaded Britain. There is a split between the resistance and those who would prefer to collaborate with the occupying German army. It Happened Here was the first of several films that Kevin Bronwlow would direct that dealt with various aspects of the history, (both real and imagined) of the British Isles. Brownlow began this project when he was eighteen, andwith the help of Stanley Kubrick and Tony Richardson, completed the film eight years later. Shot on weekends with nonactors and borrowed equipment, the film was madein collaboration with Andrew Mollo, Bronlow’s Nazi regalia-collecting school friend (who eventually went on to design Imperial costumes for Star Wars.) KevinBrownlow's 1968 book about the making of the film, How It Happened Here, has recently been republished.

US/West Germany 1979, color, 121 min.
With John Savage, Treat Williams, Beverly D’Angelo
A band of hippies in Central Park led by the dynamic Berger (played with great zeal by Treat Williams) encounters a young draftee from Oklahoma (Savage) and seeks to open his mind to the counterculture. Based on the seemingly unfilmable Broadway smash, Milos Forman’s rousing work was one of the few successes in the musical genre during the 1970s. Made four years after the fall of Saigon, the film serves as more of a tribute to the ideals of the protest movement than a reassertion of its ideology.

After his successful forays into the musical (The Umbrellas of Cherbourg, The Young Ladies of Rochefort), Jacques Demy traveled to Los Angeles to produce his first American film. Continuing the story of his title character from Lola, once again played by Anouk Aimée, Demy puts his heroine at the center of a whirlwind relationship with a disaffected architect. The film’s soundtrack was produced by the rock group Spirit, and features Fred Willard in a bit part as a gas station attendant.

With Jack Nicholson, Maria Schneider, Jenny Runacre
One of the international co-productions that marked the 1970s, The Passenger teams Jack Nicholson with Maria Schneider, who at the time was famous for her role in Last Tango in Paris. As Antonioni focuses his camera on the infinite desert, Nicholson portrays David Locke, a television reporter assigned to cover guerilla activity in North Africa who instead fakes his own death, switching identities with a dead English acquaintance. The ending of the film features an incredible, justifiably famous seven-minute long shot.

Directed by Joaquim Pedro de Andrade
Brazil 1969, color, 110 min.
With Grande Otelo, Paulo Jose, Jardel Filho
Portuguese with English subtitles
Macunaima’s foreword tells us the film “is the story of a Brazilian devoured by Brazil.” And so this landmark of Latin American cinema—and one of the most significant works of Cinema Nôvo's Tropicalist movement—begins. Based on the 1928 modernist novel of the same name, the film follows its hero from the jungle to São Paulo; his fantastic adventures include his transformation to a white man (and back again) and encounters with urban guerillas, cannibalistic industrialists, and, finally, a water spirit who eats him.
Unmistakably political, Macunaima is an exhilarating mixture of zany comedy, flamboyant experimentation, and Brazilian folklore—presented here in a beautiful restoration showcasing its brilliant color.

Directed by Pier Paolo Pasolini
Italy 1972, color, 109 min.
With Tom Baker, Hugh Griffith, and Jenny Runacre
Italian with English subtitles
Susan Sontag called Pasolini "the most remarkable figure to have emerged in Italian arts and letters since the Second World War." The second entry in his erotic Trilogy of Life, Canterbury Tales re-interprets Chaucer’s classic tales (The Cook’s Tale is expanded into an homage to Chaplin and American silent comedy), continuing The Decameron’s epic—and outrageous—celebration of life and the naked human body. While some sensed a "loss of confidence in the liberating powers of human sexuality" (Peter Bondanella), the Canterbury Tales did not fail to provoke, or find critical success; it had the Italian censors infuriated by its obscenity and "vilification of religion,” and won the Golden Bear at Berlin in 1972.

With Carol Burnett, Paul Dooley, Geraldine Chaplin
Similar in structure to his hugely successful Nashville, Altman’s multi-character follow-up focuses on a high society wedding in Chicago attended by a coterie of oddball characters. Altman ups the ante from his previous large cast productions with approximately forty-eight characters intermingling (and overlapping) at the event (Nashville, by comparison, featured about twenty-five characters). The film was coolly received on its initial release for failing to live up to the standards of Altman’s previous work but it has since been reconsidered, most notably by the Lyric Opera of Chicago, who adapted the film for a stage production.

With Nadine Nortier, Jean-Claude Guilbert, Maria Cardinal
French with English subtitles
A spiritual meditation on isolation and suffering, Mouchette is a visual study whose tragic eponymous heroine achieves a Bressonian grace. A major filmmaker whose idiosyncratic style has been described as creating a cinematic language unto itself, Bresson treats the incidents of fourteen year old Mouchette’s everyday existence with his customary precision and restraint. Loved by both Ingmar Bergman and Jim Jarmusch (who placed it in his top ten films of all time), the film is a moving portrait containing a fairground sequence of pure, exuberant joy unlike anything else in Bresson’s oeuvre.

With Julie Christie, Donald Sutherland
A young British couple devastated by their daughter’s accidental death travels to Venice, where they are haunted by recurring visions of the child. One of Britain’s pre-eminent cinematographers of the early 70s, Roeg adapted Daphne Du Maurier’s short story into an elliptical, sensuous, and chilling exploration of grief and the supernatural, full of hypnotic, ominous imagery. British icon Julie Christie followed up her Oscar-nominated performance in Robert Altman’s McCabe and Mrs. Miller with this gripping performance opposite Donald Sutherland.

Directed by John Schlesinger
UK 1963, b/w, 98 min.
With Tom Courtenay, Julie Christie, Wilfred Pickles
With powerful performances in The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner and Billy Liar, Tom Courtenay stood at the forefront of the British New Wave. His portrayal of the title character in this film is certainly the lighter of the two but no less complex in its construct. Billy is a young man who dreams of leaving behind his dreary life in Northern England for an idealized existence in Ambrosia, a fantasyland where he rules supreme. His penchant for escapism gets him entangled in a web of lies and engagements to three women, including Julie Christie in a free-spirited debut performance. Schlesinger successfully balances the fantastic elements of the stage play on which the film is based with a fitting measure of Kitchen Sink realism.

Directed by John Cassavetes
US 1970, color, 131 min.
With John Cassavetes, Peter Falk, Ben Gazzara
Cassavetes directed himself for the first time in this portrait of three husbands (played by Cassavetes, Falk, and Gazzara) shaken by the death of a mutual friend. The men go on a drunken bender that takes them to London, where they gamble and pick up women before returning to New York and their families. What’s at stake in this mid-career work from the father of American independent cinema is the raw power of the characters’ desperation. The men are funny, flawed, and searching, their quest indicative of Cassavetes’ desire to show the “tough and crazy” truth of human behavior—and his faith that “if the feelings are true and the relationship is pure, the story will come out of that.”

With Vaclav Neckar, Josef Somr, Vlastimil Brodsky
Czech and German with English subtitles
Released at the height of the excitement surrounding the Czech New Wave, Menzel’s debut film sticks closely to the experiences of its protagonist, providing a concentrated and empathetic look at an individual’s experience in the context of vast historical change. Milos (Neckar) comes of age as a trainee at a rail station through which Nazi supply trains pass; his sexual initiation enables him to commit a previously unthinkable act of bravery. The film’s delicate balance of humanism, sensuality, and satire underscores its powerful political message.

Directed by Krzysztof Zanussi
Poland 1977, color, 106 min.
With Piotr Garlicki, Zbigniew Zapasiewicz, Mariusz Dmochowski
Polish with English subtitles
Zanussi's sixth film is the story of machinations surrounding the awarding of a prize in linguistics, Camouflage revealed much about the corruption of scholarly life in Poland—despite the assertion of the Communist Party that there was no such school and no such professors. But the film's setting, a summer institute, also functioned as a microcosm of Polish society as a whole—surely the reason why Camouflage, although neither advertised nor reviewed when it opened in Poland in 1977, attracted more than a million viewers and became Zanussi’s first commercial success. Polish filmmakers today consider it the beginning of the "cinema of moral restlessness," which in the late 1970s included the best films of Kieslowski, Kijowski, Falk, and others.Dodd: 'It's not size; we're preoccupied with size.'
Chris Dodd is chairman of the Senate Banking Committee and principal author of the financial regulation bill that the Senate will consider next week. We met at his Senate office Wednesday to speak about the makings of the financial crisis, his approach to financial regulation and whether we need to break up the banks. An edited transcript follows.
Ezra Klein: Tell me your narrative of how the financial crisis happened. What happened to us in 2008? What brought the financial sector down?
Chris Dodd: I'd been chairman of the Banking Committee for 38 months. I actually remember a day in the fall of 2007, before Paul Sarbanes retired, that we were in some chaotic mess in the committee and he put his right arm around my shoulder and swept his left hand in front of him and he said, "Just think, in a few months all of this is yours." I had no idea how prescient that was..
In fact, Dick Shelby, that night of September 18th as he was sitting next to me in Nancy Pelosi's office, kept on whispering to me, "If they'd only listened to you." But on the mortgage thing, we just couldn't get any attention. That was the primary cause of what was otherwise a manageable set of issues. It would have been a difficult time, but it didn't have to explode into what it became in the fall of 2008. People don't know this, but we came within a hair of the United States government declaring that Monday a bank holiday for the first time since the Great Depression.
EK: Huh. I haven't heard that before.
CD: I went on a flight Sunday night to Brussels to meet with central bankers over there to talk about these issues, and I got on the plane at 6 or 7 at Dulles and didn't know until I landed in Brussels the following morning that in fact J.P. Morgan had stepped up. Then in the summer, you had the Fannie/Freddie stuff, Hank Paulson saying, "I'm not going to use the bazooka, but I've got it in my pocket here," so in '08, everyone became more engaged. But there should have been a deeper appreciation that this wasn't just a Bear Stearns issue. Then of course comes September 18th, the night where Hank Paulson and Bernanke says, "Unless you act within a matter of days, the entire financial system will melt down."
I got charged that night by Harry Reid that Barney [Frank] and I would pull together what turned out to be the Emergency Economic Stabilization bill. And, of course, you may recall that we got an e-mail, three pages from Hank Paulson. He wanted $700 billion, no court can intervene, no regulator can intervene, and of course over the weekend the country went nuts when they heard about this. By Sunday night, we had an 82-page bill drafted in the Banking Committee, and frankly there were concerns I had that the House was going to go along with Paulson, just give him the money, get the issue off the table. So we wrote a bill, and those next two weeks were a wild time, with John McCain suspending his campaign and everything else. But the bill passed 75 to 24; Ted Kennedy was the one missing vote that night.
EK: And to ask about the other dimension to that question: What actually happened to cause this? Not just how did the government respond, but literally what created the problem? What, when we talk about the financial regulation and Wall Street, are we attempting to fix?
CD: The first thing that happened was that you had a lot of unregulated entities…
EK: Shadow banks.
CD: Yeah. You need securitization, but the failure to have underwriting standards, the fact that they could go out and just lure people in, the no-doc loans, the fabrication of information. When you go to the Web sites of these brokers they said that the first thing you as a broker should do is convince the borrowers you're their financial adviser. I put that up in my first hearing. And of course they were anything but your financial adviser. , But then the bank was selling the loans off in eight to 10 weeks, so they were out of the game, and of course the rating agencies don't conduct due diligence. So it was just a series of dominoes that created this huge bubble and there was nothing underneath it. That's why so much of what this bill is designed to do is make sure that there's no one again in the financial services sector that can escape regulation.
EK: There are a lot of pieces to the bill, there's derivatives, there's resolution authority, and on and on and on. So is that the theory of the bill? Get the shadow banks into the regulatory structure? Is there a theory of the bill? Or is it just a lot of different things we should do?
CD: There are three main things. One is to fill in the regulatory gaps that clearly were the source of the problems that created this crisis. Secondly, to provide the kind of tools that didn't exist. In the world in which you and I live today, we have no radar system, really, that allows us to be able to look over the horizon, not just domestically but internationally to see what's happening. So what happened in England with Rock, what's the name of the bank…
EK: Northern Rock.
CD: Northern Rock, for instance. Or Greece. How do you get the ability to identify potentially systemic problems? So that's the second piece of this bill. The third piece is, in a way, is to say, "Look, be careful now." We're a global leader in financial services, so I want to make sure as we fill in the gaps, provide the tools and the radar for the future problems, you don't strangle the system. Some of these words have become pejoratives, and they're not, they're needed. Derivatives are needed for stability in the marketplace. So we want to make sure that in our ability to do this, we're not doing it in a way that causes us to lose our leadership in the world, one. So those are my three goals. It's not easy to manage all of them.
EK: You're saying we need to balance the need to help regulators more easily detect and respond to a crisis with the need to preserve Wall Street's basic functioning. But do you worry, and does anything in this bill address, the question of regulatory failure? You have Alan Greenspan coming before the FCIC saying, "We just didn't know. We didn't see it. We need this to be automatic because in the future we won't see it again." You have Robert Rubin, who comes in and he says, "I was on Citibank's board of director's but I just didn't know, I didn't realize this could happen." There was a fair amount of information out there already, there were people, as you say, before your committee who predicted it. But there were incentives, in the boom times, to ignore it. How do you handle that?
CD: Because they too narrowly defined the word "safety" and "soundness." Things are going up, money's being made, that's it! What could be not safe and sound about that? But "safety" and "soundness" ought not to be so narrowly defined as "people are making money." What are capital standards? Where are the leverage points in all this? How much liquidity is there? What's happening to consumers out there? The consumer protection idea is not just nice, to have something over here for consumers, it was the missing element in a lot of this in terms of what was actually going on in that marketplace.
In addition, I don't buy these, "Oh, we didn't see it," they didn't want to see it, things were going too well, they were too fat, too much money was being made, and smart people, when you look at 40, 50 to 1 leverage, who in their right mind would have thought that made any sense at all? And regulators were being told that every bank was going to go to London. The first thing I got when I came in, "Boy, it's a new chair of the committee, you better get with it, everybody's going to go to London." I haven't heard that comment lately. But that was the move in January of '07 even.
EK: But nothing in your bill says you can't have 40 to 1 or 50 to 1 leverage.
CD: It says regulators…
EK: It says regulators can decide that you can't.
CD: Barney put the number in there, in his bill.
EK: At 15 to 1, right?
CD: Yeah. And I don't disagree with it; obviously it makes sense to me, or 12 makes sense. I'm not opposed to it. But what's the competency of Congress? When we write this up, I'll guarantee you, before the ink is dry, some 22-year-old is going to come out and figure six different ways to get around what I've just written. Not that that can't happen with the regulators, but those are the people we ask to do this, these are supposed to be the talented, bright people who spend all day focusing on this and learning the subject. Maybe I'm wrong about it, but I honestly feel that I've got a better chance of getting better results in terms of what we're trying to achieve through that approach than the approach of, "Forget the regulators, we're just going to write it ourselves."
EK: It seems you're caught between a rock and a hard place here. On the one hand, you can't look at what happened and say, "The regulators will not fail us." The regulators will tell you themselves that they'll fail you. Then, on the other hand, Congress does not feel that it has the competency to write these rules, there's the fear that what you could write here will be gamed in five years. Which is why I think some of your colleagues, like Senator Kaufman and Brown, along with some in the expert community, have argued that as long as we're going at this "too big to fail" problem, it's just going to be unsolvable. They're too powerful, it's too complex, we don't have the expertise, and it's why we should do the simplest thing and just break up the large banks beyond some basic level of assets.
CD: I don't agree with Paul Krugman a whole hell of a lot of stuff, but I agree with him on this one..
What we've done here says that if you're going to become a certain size, that's fine. But you're going to have to meet different capital standards, you're going to have different criteria that are going to protect us against the possibility you can fail. And just in case you have any doubts about this, if you do fail, all your management's fired, all your shareholders lose, all your creditors lose, you can't go back into the business for years to come. So yeah, you can get bigger, but there are going to be a lot of things to insulate us and our economy from the kind of hazards you could pose by your size.
EK: A lot of what you say, when you say it's not size but interconnectedness, seems to be a critique located in the derivatives market. That's where the interconnectedness comes, that's where the complexity is. What are your bright lines on derivatives?
CD: Let the market work. I've had people tell me that had the market known about the financial products division of AIG, that that wouldn't have lasted 30 seconds. But they didn't. It was the shadow economy. So a lot of sunlight, a lot of transparency, ought to be the presumption as you're looking at this. I believe if people can see what's going on, then the markets will react to this stuff. Now I accept the notion that there are certain derivatives where there just isn't a volume in what you're dealing with here that it probably doesn't need to be on an exchange. But I like the idea of a presumption of an exchange, because the exchange is where I get the sunshine on this. And if markets are reacting as they ought to be, they'll have their own way of pricing these products or rejecting them because of their shortcomings or their weaknesses.
EK: The final question here, and I don't want this to sound like cheap populism because it isn't, but a lot of the current level profits in Wall Street come from this complexity, this over the counter, bilateral trading. There's just a lot more money in trading products that only you understand. We saw before the crisis that Wall Street profits were a bit below 40 percent of all domestic profits,and now they're back up there again. Should we worry about that systemically? Is a country where 40 percent of our profits are in the financial sector, is that a healthy economy and is it even possible to regulate a sector where there is such enormous reward for risk?
CD: I don't like the equation. I don't believe you ought to be giving up manufacturing and the kind of job creations that go on with producing things. Putting aside the debate on what should happen to the financial sector, I worry about a country that is innovative enough to produce plasma televisions, but not smart enough to figure out how to make them here. The other piece here is accountability afterwards. This becomes the responsibility of Congress, in every administration you've got to be overseeing what the regulators do. You've got to be bringing them up. The fact is, we put the Vice President of the Fed and tell him or her, "You're responsible for systemic risk. That's your job." So that person comes up for the vice chairmanship of the Federal Reserve Board, your job is, you're getting called up because you're the point person on the Fed board now for systemic risk. There's someone I can grab by the lapels in the future and say, "What are you doing? What's going on out there? What's happening out there?"
Now if Congress doesn't do it, and future chairs of the committee doesn't do it, I don't know how to regulate that. We had, basically, eight or 10 or 12 years here, members of Congress saying basically, "You guys are doing great." So the notion of getting back to an economy where, again, institutions are performing back to more of their core functions is something that I think is important. I don't restore Glass-Steagall in this bill. But we come pretty close to trying to at least push or cajole or lure institutions back to more core functions. Banks being banks. We've got to move this thing back, and I think we achieve a lot of that through this bill. That answers your question, we need to get back to the time before 40 percent of our economic success was just coming up with fancy instruments that allowed people to make a profit off of them without producing much.

Simply restoring Glass-Steagall might not be enough. There was other legislation prior to the repeal of G-S (e.g. the Monetary Control Act of 1980) that stripped other protections from the system. Repealing G-S was just the last step in Milton Friedman's acolytes' campaign to unleash the financial sector.
(And with the Bush administration as absentee dogcatcher, that newly unleashed pit bull proceeded to savage the economy.)
While I want at least the protection that prior Keynsian-based regulations provided, I can't fault Dodd for writing new regulations from scratch to try and take into account things that we didn't know when the original regulations were enacted.

Forgot one thing: I want a 15:1 leverage ratio in the final bill, but that should be a threshold for automatic public review, not necessarily specific action. That way, while you leave determining specific actions to the regulators, you don't give them any discretion about whether or not to drag that comapany's into the light. Given the stigma attached to public review of leverage risk, I'd bet most companies would not want their leverage ratios to rise above 15:1 and be publicly identified for being over-leveraged.

I've read the 10:19 AM comment from Gallenod above twice: "That way, while you leave determining specific actions to the regulators, you don't give them any discretion about whether or not to drag that company into the light."
That sounds practical -- so I'm left to wonder if such practices (and hard upper limits to regulatory discretion) have been considered. The presence of such limits on regulatory discretion, even if ultimately ineffective, might go a long way in restoring public confidence in the regulators, in congress, and in the system of regulation itself.

I don't blame him either, though it may not be necessary. The reality is, what we had in place before seemed to work pretty well over a long period of time. Extra stuff (which can have unintended consequences and costs not anticipated, and that perhaps cannot be anticipated until the new systems are in place) should, frankly, come after--perhaps well after--the effects of returning to what we knew worked before are observed and measured.
Also, frankly, they don't sound serious about re-instituting Glass-Steagall. They should brink it back, in it's full pre-1980s glory, and call it Glass-Steagall. Exactly the same.

Look the shadow banking - unregulated and part of regulated banks extended trading arms on leveraged derivatives - is what brought the meltdown. And if you can't separate them from traditional banks, there is no way you an oversee 24/7 trading houses.
Me thinks, from Aug'07, that first Investment Banks must be completely autonomus entities and Hedge Funds need to be suspended until we can find ways and means to regulate them....

Size does matter -- when you're too big to fail, you can also write your own rules.

Phil and Wendy Gramm are having a melancholy moment as the perfidy they did on behalf of the financial sector and the Republican Party is mitigated.
Dodd is correct to say that while size—as in too big too fail— is a problem it is risk —as in leveraged 40 to 1— that is the device threatening the world's economy with Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) as nuclear weapons were described during the cold war.
In 2000, Texan Republican Senator Phil Gramm slipped a thick, 262-page measure (the Commodity Futures Modernization Act: more on that below) into a $384 billion spending bill.
The act, said Gramm, (his wife Wendy was head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission from 1988 to 1993 after a lobbying campaign from Enron, the CFTC exempted it from regulation in trading of energy derivatives. Subsequently, Wendy Gramm resigned from the CFTC and took a seat on the Enron Board of Directors and served on its Audit Committee), [with credit default swaps] on the riskiest subprime mortgages than there were actual mortgages."
And lest we forget, Phil Gramm, in the role of Republican Presidential Candidate and "Not A Maverick" John McCain's chief financial advisor said, ""Some people look at subprime lending and see evil. I look at subprime lending and I see the American dream in action."
Of course Phil's idea of the "American Dream" is the nightmare we've lived through for two years and have yet to fully wake from with 20 percent unemployed—thank you Phil and Wendy and Republican teabaggers everywhere as you follow Sister Sarah at the wheel of the Tea Party express bus right off the cliff in November.

Kevin, that's right. It's easy to figure out why plasma TVs aren't produced here: we pay our workers more than in China, we provide government services to make the lives of workers better and safer, and we restrict the dangerous ways in which companies can do business. I happen to think those all good things, but if we allow business to then move their manufacturing somewhere that doesn't have those protections with no financial negatives to the company, then of course that's what happens.

The point being, "but not smart enough to figure out how to make them here" seems an odd thing to say. I would think Dodd knows why they aren't made here, and why they won't be. While we can impose financial penalties on companies that manufacturer overseas (and I think we should have higher tariffs generally, including on items manufactured overseas by American companies, but that's another discussion), it wouldn't take long for the increase in cost to be reflected at the retail level, which would hurt the American consumer.
Still, if we're going to raise taxes, going back to the tried-and-true--the estimable tariff--is a route I could approve of.

Most interesting. Dodd's answers, despite what some comments say, were clear, concise and even understandable to those who have taken a bit of time to learn about the financial system.
As I read it I was thinking how very fortunate we have been to have someone of Chris Dodd's caliber heading up this bill. He has gotten an awfully unfair rap by right-wingers, but I believe he has served us admirably and has all the right motives. So I say, thank God America had Chris Dodd at the head of this committee. Given the political climate, I think he did all that he could to protect us from future derailments. No one is perfect, but he has my thanks for doing a great job.
He is absolutely right about the years of NOTHING being done by a Republican Congress to monitor and oversee, which is their JOB. If you ever watched the few committee hearings held during the Bush administration's first six years you can recall the Republicans giving the financial industry a totally free ride, just pats on the head. They made it hard for Democrats to get anything done as well. But those were the old days. Now, with President Obama and a Democratic Congress the country can finally move again in the right direction, under laws, and in accord with the Constitution.
Some of the comments here by right-wingers show a lot of ignorance even as they assume they know history. Would that they actually avail themselves of a few facts before they take the time to write something.

There's basically two things that need to be done:
1) Separate banks from the derivatives trading and investment banking businesses. Entities for which the taxpayer is the ultimate guarantor should not be allowed to engage in these types of risky activities.
2) Significantly increase margin requirements for firms that take positions in these kids of highly-leveraged investments. If firms want to make these kids of risky bets, make sure that they have enough of their own money on deposit to where if they go bad, we don't need ti run to Washington to keep the financial system solvent.

In response to the first question, Dodd says:
!"
Here's the list of Senate Finance Committee meetings for 2007:
He is apparently talking about the 02/07/2007 hearings on "Preserving the American Dream: Predatory Lending Practices and Home Foreclosures."
The conclusion of the president of the National Association of Mortgage Brokers is a real hoot:
"We recommend Congress to put forth measures and explore those avenues that outreach to borrowers and provide meaningful education to them in a timely fashion rather than just at the time of application or at the closing table. Possessing a fundamental understanding of the mortgage lending marketplace and the loan product types available will empower borrowers to comparison shop, ask meaningful questions and make financial decisions that advance their personal life objectives. Again, NAMB strongly believes that because financial education is the key to choosing the right loan product and protecting oneself against fraud, the consumer education process should begin at a young age. To this end, NAMB supports any effort that calls for federal funding to support consumer financial literacy efforts and outreach programs during the school years."

There is something inherently sketchy about allowing someone like Dodd who has major ties to the financial services industry to be in charge of some of the seminal financial regulation of our era.

"I worry about a country that is innovative enough to produce plasma televisions, but not smart enough to figure out how to make them here."
Actually, they're smart enough to not make them here. Relatively high corporate taxes vs. relatively low tariffs, importation makes more sense than manufacturer (and, of course, lower wages in manufacturing countries play a role, as well).
Too bad you didn't touch on the potential of the VAT tax. One of the likely unintended consequences of a VAT is that it would move more manufacturing and even assembly out of America, leaving us with almost nothing but a service economy. So the share of US business profits that the financial sector represents would go up--way up. Although overall GDP would likely go down.
"I don't restore Glass-Steagall in this bill"
Of, course not. Instead of re-instituting a core set of time-tested regulations that we know worked, we want to do new stuff that may work or may have unintended (and negative) consequences. Cuz we're smarter than 200 years of American history.
Sigh.Borderlands 2 will have infinite level progression
Gearbox Software have announced Borderlands 2’s Badass system which is set to take levelling-up in a video game to whole new, er, levels.
Badass will be linked to your player profile and the more you play Boarderlands 2 the more you’ll level it up gaining tokens along the way that can be used to increase your characters stats. Gearbox head, Randy Pitchford, seems, quite rightly, very excited about the whole idea saying that, as far as he’s aware, it’s the first system in a game that allows both character and player profile growth at the same time without any sort of cap. He’s already predicting dedicated players with Badass levels reaching into the thousands as the company strive to make Borderlands 2 into a hobby that people will continue to indulge in for years.
Borderlands 2 is due out in September this year. For more on the game, visit it’s official site, here:

As with many TT riders, Donald’s career is a roller coaster of extraordinary accomplishments and tragic mishaps, but Norton came prepared. The British bike company has brought two ex-TT winners, Mick Grant and Steve Plater, on board to assist in development and help secure a winning combination over the next three years.
 Planter now involved, this is sure to be an exciting year,” said Donald. “Norton is synonymous with the Isle of Man TT and I can’t wait to ride the new SG3 round the Mountain Course and add to their Isle of Man history.”
Only time will tell if the gambles Norton has made will pay off but one thing is for certain, they are just as excited as Donald about the opportunities that lay ahead, as CEO of Norton Motorcycles, Stuart Garner noted.
“Cameron is a really great rider to have on board, not only as a racer but also as a brand ambassador for Norton. His support, feedback and endorsement will all be really important to us both as a company and as a race team as we look to and we are all relishing the challenge of developing a strong bike and team around him for the long-term.”
2014 is shaping up to be an exciting year for the TT, after all the rule changes and shuffling that has taken place, it will be interesting to see where the chips fall.

It can become clear quite quickly who really cares about their customers and who does it to see the betterment of society due to their product, and who simply is asleep at the wheel!
The two sites I noticed the big difference between are Flipgrid, a brand new and exciting resource I was introduced to through ECMP355, and WordPress, the blog I have been using semi-faithfully since 2nd year education. I also used WordPress when I was a kid and it was more of a journalism site for reading and writing fiction – so I have a long and rocky history with it!
I love WordPress as a site because of all that it has to offer for blogging, but it goes with its share of frustrations. I had two questions which I thought were fairly simple. I even repeated one once (the first time it was just a tweet of utter frustration).
No replies by WordPress. This is how I felt.
Other people like and retweet which is proof, to me, that these questions are valid to be asked and that, if WordPress answered these questions, they would be helping out more than one person. I also understand I can possibly get the answers through trial and error, reading FAQs on their site, or by Googling for others’ solutions – however, if you are on digital media, why not really be there to help a girl out quickly?
WordPress only tweets every few weeks, and if you look at their Twitter page it has no retweets to their followers’ pages. I think the site needs to hire a full time tweeter to get people more excited about what WordPress has to offer, and answer all of our questions!
Flipgrid, on the other hand, is the coolest organization around when it comes to social media presence. I follow them on Twitter and they are proactively sharing their resource as well as reacting instantaneously to people (customers) with answers or positive comments/likes/retweets. They help their customers get noticed, educated and connected on Twitter in the meantime. I got 25+ likes on one of my tweets and I am sure it is because they retweeted it! Just check out these tweets below. Here, they answer a great question:
They re-tweeted this, and a few other tweets I put out about them.
I even learned something new about Flipgrid while writing this post – people do face-to-face educational chats with other professionals!!! What!!! This could be a way to expand my professional development and PLN. I am using this as an example, showing that they retweet what other Tweeters have to say about them – they are interested in what is being done with their product.
They liked every tweet I made that had their handle in it – even one that didn’t (my blog post):
This is how Flipgrid makes me feel:
So, How Does This Apply As A Teacher?
From this, I reflect that, as an educator, I need to be available in diverse ways to my students. It is no longer acceptable to ONLY have a phone number and an office to meet face-to-face. Even an e-mail is starting to seem lacking. I think teachers should still have their down time (students shouldn’t expect e-mails back until next work day – although the reality is that many teachers will reply back before then out of the kindness of their hearts!) HOWEVER I realize now how it makes a difference, as a student, when you can just ask a simple question through writing (or a short video!) rather than bothering with a phone call or calling a meeting. Becoming connected in more technology won’t mean more of a hassle, it can mean LESS of a hassle (quick answers) for both teacher and student.
I think it is wonderful that students, staff, and parents can now reach me through my blog, Twitter, or e-mail.

Today, however, Motorola unveiled the Moto X. This one matters.
Why? Because it’s the first phone built entirely on Google’s watch. Google knows it has to move into making devices—its strategy of seeding Android into hardware for free has led to great mobile market share but not great mobile profits. Hardware equals hard currency, and no doubt Google is tired of seeing companies like Samsung (005930:KS) make a killing off work done in Mountain View.
Motorola introduced the Moto X at an event in New York on Thursday morning. The presentation departed from the standard playbook right from the beginning, as Rick Osterloh, Google’s senior vice president in charge of Moto X, jumped in by talking about Touchless Control, the phone’s hands-free, voice-activated interface. You can say to the phone, “OK, Google Now. Call so-and-so,” or “Find a sushi restaurant nearby,” or “Did the Mets win last night?” Since Google structures more and more of its search data, questions like the last one can be processed and answered via a synthetic voice. (“No. They lost 3-2 to the Marlins,” the phone replies.)
Unlike most new-product launches, the proceedings here did not start with the product, but with the services. There was no video showing off the beautiful curves or chamfered edges of the Moto X, which will come out at the end of August with a base price of $199 for the 16GB model ($249 for 32GB). We learned about the camera (it comes on when you twist the phone twice) and the Active Display (relevant info pops up on the lock screen when you move the phone), and then only at the end did we get into the hardware side of hardware.
Funny thing is, there’s actually something interesting happening with the Moto X as a device, not just a collection of services. The phone’s design is certainly attractive—its slim bezel and curved back fit right in with modern phone design—but it’s what buyers can do with the design that may help distinguish it from the rest of the smartphone pack.
Motorola will launch Motomaker, an online service that allows users to custom-order their phone in a combination of colors and materials, alongside the Moto X. The presentation referred to Nike’s (NKE) ID program, in which customers can personalize a pair of sneakers, and Mini’s endless combinations of accessories and finishes that prospective owners can sort through before buying a car.
The Motomaker site lets you select the back color, the front color (so long as it’s black or white), and the accent color on camera-lens surrounds and side-mounted buttons. Motorola also showed off prototypes of some woods it’s using to make a wood-based back cover. That material won’t be available on Day One but is expected soon after. There are also accessories like headsets from SOL Republic, which can be ordered in the same colors that are available for the phone.
Until now, phone customization was limited to cases and more-expensive refits. Motorola’s effort brings more individualization to more people. During the presentation, the company was also keen on pointing out the delivery-date estimator, which updates in real time. Ordering a phone to your own specs takes four days in most cases, but that time frame can shift by a day or two if, say, everyone wants an olive-green phone with orange accents.
Making this type of customization a reality is a smartphone assembly plant in Fort Worth, the only one of its kind in the U.S. Motorola purchased the facility (it had once been a Nokia (NOK) plant) and employs around 2,000 people there to put together phones based on specs coming out of Motomaker, as well as standard-issue devices in black or white. Motorola says it doesn’t know how much of the production will be taken up by custom orders, but its not taking any chances in case the idea takes off. “We’ve optimized [the plant in] Texas to assume that everyone will want a custom phone,” says Chief Executive Officer Dennis Woodside. “If we’re wrong, it’s a lot easier to go back to making black-and-white models than to go in the other direction.”
All in all, it was an impressive showing. Of course, we’ve seen impressive showings before. The Palm Pre looked good when it first came out. Nokia’s Lumia phones were well-received, too. The trick for Motorola is to convert “Hey, that’s a pretty cool phone” to “Man, I gotta get one of those.” Perhaps Motomaker will be the key to that.Blamed it on either my Nyonya heritage or my own disturbingly distinct palate, but I have a penchant for what other people would classify as stinky foods. Stinky as in salted fish, Chinese cheese, belacan, and yes, fermented shrimp. My neighbors go out to eat when I prepare this last dish.
Locally known as Cincaluk, it usually comes packaged in a small glass bottle and can be purchased at markets throughout Malaysia. This delicacy is particularly popular in the Peranakan states of. Cincalok is commonly used to make Cincaluk Sambal with slices of shallots, bird’s eye chilies, and lime juice. It’s also used as flavoring for certain stir-fried Nyonya dishes…
Personally, I love my Cincaluk with steamed eggs. Adding just a couple spoonful of Cincaluk turns a plain and boring steamed egg into a savory dish, plus it only takes just a few ingredients and less than 10 minutes to whip up.
Mmmmm. The one downside being the pungent smell lingering in your kitchen after the meal. So consider yourself warned, and perhaps you should warn the neighbors too!Herbal Remedy For Diabetes – Think First Before You Act

Herbal Remedy For Diabetes – Think First Before You Act
Article by Amy Harwell
When someone gets diagnosed with diabetes, they no longer feel helpless about the condition. Since medications are available and the illness is not automatically fatal, people tend to be a little complacent about their treatments. However, this assumption that the disease is unlikely to cause death is a total misconception. If people do not make medical consultations and treat it as lax as treating an ordinary cold, they will eventually experience complications and this time it would be fatal. Taking an herbal remedy for diabetes should also be subjected to careful consideration before you begin using it.
Apart from the proven medical treatments for this disease like insulin injections and blood sugar tests, there are other things that you can do to help these drugs achieve its full potential within your body system. Eating nutritious food and having a well planned diet according to the needs and prohibitions will give the body the necessary boosting effect that makes it stronger for further chemical treatment. Using natural help is also another
People are now giving importance to herbal remedy for diabetes because of their effectiveness. Like what Joe Barton says in his guide, Diabetes Reversal Report, they are cost efficient, natural and have no side effects. People do not need to fear that they would have adverse effects on their body since these are all natural herbs and well-tested principles.
Any herbal remedy for diabetes if backed up by studies will surely have no harmful side effects on your body unless you are taking these herbal treatments without the knowledge of your doctor who has a better idea of your body’s capacity to take on supplements, any allergies that you may not be completely aware of and your medical history that may also affect your current condition.

Thread: Fisher four Pillars
Fisher four Pillars
When ask what is you philosophy
The new four pillars
Run the the ball
Protect the QB
Play good defense
Get the ball back
Re: Fisher four Pillars
Those are oddly football-related.
Re: Fisher four Pillars
i like those 4 pillars.
also:
Cladwell fired, i wonder if Fisher regrets choosing and not waiting more. also seems a little odd they announce it right when they have a press conferance for Fisher.
Re: Fisher four Pillars
I'm only surprised it took this long. Probably had to clear it with Peyton.That's my story, and I'm sticking to it!!

Re: Fisher four Pillars
Let me recommend these four pillars:1. Kick ass2. Take names3. Play to win the game 4. Stop dropping the ball!!!
Re: Fisher four Pillars
While I am ready and glad we are at the next stage I will stand by this statement.
Devaney, Spags and the four pillars were needed at the time they arrived and they have left the team with a solid foundation for Fisher to build on.
It's easy to make fun of them now but if our locker room was riddled with bad characters and turmoil... there is a good chance today's press conference would have been held in Miami.
Re: Fisher four Pillars
Fisher did lay out what he feels is the basis to build his team on...
“The philosophy is very simple,” Fisher said. “We want to do whatever it takes to win football games. We want to be a tough, physical football team.”
As for the rest of the team, Fisher wants it to pass block, run the ball, play stout defense and get the ball back for the offense.

Re: Fisher four Pillars
Four pillars which actually correspond to the game of football. I think this is a much better concept than the original 4 pillars.?
Re: Fisher four Pillars
I thought Fisher chose the Rams because our owner was going to stay out of his way. I don't see where Spag's 4 pillars has anything to do with it at all. In fact if good character translated to good football then Spags wouldn't have been fired.
Re: Fisher four Pillars
Once again it just my belief but I think good characters in the locker room help to build a foundation and bad characters in the locker room are obstacles you have to over come.
Re: Fisher four Pillars
I wouldn't ever downplay the effect of having good character players on any team. The feasibility of finding players in the draft, who have the talent to match their good character, was always going to be very difficult for Spags. But fair play to him, he did try and do it the right way.?
Re: Fisher four Pillars
We had a GM who made getting high-character guys the highest priority. That philosophy took us from Super Bowl contenders to basement dwellers. That philosophy left us with a roster that needed to be completely blown up.
Apparently, it has done the same thing for you guys. When I read about the Rams, the topic is usually the dearth of talent, not the depth of talent. You have some key players that you can build a team around, but the only one that really figured into Fisher's decision was Bradford. I am as sure as I can be that the Rams' current talent and character in the locker room had very little to do with his decision to be the Rams head coach, because the majority of those guys are going to be gone soon.

They took my license and registration. They came back and said, "Ma'am we are going to have to take you to jail. Your license expired a month ago, and in SC we put people in jail for that sort of thing."
*In between all this I suddenly realized that I was with child and had not cried yet...
The thought of spending the night in this small town...and in JAIL sent me over the edge and I started bawling. I grabbed my stomach and leaned back, making it obvious I was pregnant.
All of a sudden the policemen started freaking out and begging me to calm down. They said things like:
"Please, we don't want you to have that baby here."
"Please calm down. Don't get worked up."
"Don't worry ma'am we wont make you go to jail."
And they let me off the HOOK with just a warning!
They also gave me precise directions and details like, "When you go through such and such a town, there are a lot of deer so be careful." (all in a thick southern drawl)
Oh my word! I was shaking with fear as I drove away, and I had to take the remain back roads UNDER the speed limit.
Then, when I was 15 minutes from home, on the highway, when I was nearly asleep, a HUGE, white wolf ran in front of my car and I had to swerve to avoid a major wreck.
It took me thirty minutes to unwind from that car ride. I cannot believe that IF I WASN'T PREGNANT, I would have spent the night in JAIL!
Talk about an adrenaline rush!! I'm SO glad you are pregnant!! :) Talk about a "get out of jail free" card, right? Plus, no one can resist a crying woman. Glad all turned out okay! Love ya!
Helen Joy, this is one of the best stories ever. HAahahahah I love it. Good job on working the pregnancy.
This is hilarious! Baby, or partner in crime (;?!
Must have been wonderful to see them start freaking out, oh the unanticipated pleasures of pregnancy ! Also, just to say i really love your blog and writing style. It's witty and classy, thoroughly enjoyable. thanks! :)

A good few years back The Brothers Strause (visual effects whizz kids) directed a little sc-fi film called Skyline that did fairly good business. Shot on a low budget it tells the tale of an alien invasion mainly seen through the eyes of a group of survivors holed up in an apartment block as the attack occurs outside. While not particularly favoured by the critical establishment the film has gained a cult following in part due to the creative alien design and impressive visual effects. One of the writers of the original, Liam O’Donnell, returns to pen the sequel and this time take up directorial reigns with The Brothers Strause on producing duty, delivering a sequel that is bigger, brasher and better.
Beyond sees LA cop Mark (Grillo) and his estranged son Trent (Weston) fending for their lives as the mysterious alien ships descend on Los Angeles sucking up humans by the thousands. Along with a selection of other plucky survivors, father and son first attempt to survive the incursion by navigating the streets of LA before then finding themselves in the bowels of an alien ship which after much fraught fighting they manage to crash in Southeast Asia. Here, they join up, after some initial resistance, with a local resistance force fronted by the tough no-nonsense Sua (Uwais) to take down the alien invaders once and for all.
Taking very much a throw-in-everything-but-the-kitchen-sink-approach to proceedings, O’Donnell and his crew up the ante in every possible way for this B-movie blast. The alien invasion goes global compared to the first film’s mainly one location setting; the creatures are bigger, badder and get much more screen time; thanks to Uwais and his team some fine martial arts action is introduced to combat the invaders; and come the finale there is even some awesome kaiju action that tops off a sequel that doesn’t know how to say no to adding more and more to its already full plate.
This both helps and hinders. There is a lot going on and a lot of character’s to juggle meaning certain sections of the film do suffer somewhat. The LA set opening nicely sets the stage but when the action switches to the intestines of the alien craft (well rendered through a combo of CGI and gooey practical effects) proceedings seem a bit rushed. Everything happens so fast on the ship, with characters fates met sooner than expected, the survivors of the first film referenced and the revelation of what the aliens are up to all flying by in a splurge of mushy alien FX and crunchy action. Before you know it, we’re in Southeast Asia.
Arguably this is where the film excels. With the LA survivors teaming with a local group of fighters the pace finds its footing and the action is ramped up to feature the likes of Iko Uwais and Yayan Ruhian (from The Raid films) dishing out silat infused alien slaying action which is a sight to behold. Grillo is on fine gruff form (and seems to be the new franchise Viagra!) and the likes of Bojana Novakovic and Jacob Vargas make their characters memorable even if they’re sometimes hampered with cringy dialogue.
It threatens to buckle under its own ambition on occasion but thanks to a game cast, some fantastic visuals and action and a few unexpected narrative detours means Beyond Skyline always remains on track as a relentlessly entertaining B-movie sci-fi actioner. Fun stuff.This deal has ended.

Review for Spirit Jump, Boynton Beach, FL, USA
I found Spirit Jump via Twitter. Being a "jumper" with Spirit Jump has been one of the most rewarding experiences I have ever had with a charity. I know who I am touching and I know their story so it is a much more personal experience than simply writing a check to a charity.
More Feedback
What I've enjoyed the most about my experience with this nonprofit is...
Knowing that I am making someone smile. I also enjoy the fact that there is no pressure or long term commitment. You send a jump as often as you like.
The kinds of staff and volunteers that I met were...
Everyone have have met is very passionate about Spirit Jump. The staff have their own cancer battles and are very invested in this cause and it shows.
If this organization had 10 million bucks, it could...
Greatly expand the number of people it is able to touch and probably expand the services that are offered.
Ways to make it better...
I can't think of anything that would improve my experience. I love Spirit Jump and being a Spirit Jumper.
In my opinion, the biggest challenges facing this organization are...
I think they face what would be typical challenges for a growing non-profit, but I have confidence they will overcome those challenges as they arise.
One thing I'd also say is that...
Spirit Jump is a truly wonderful organization and I plan to be involved for the foreseeable future.

2009The Hitler Gang (1944)
This film doesn't portray Hitler as crazy or as a raving lunatic and he is shown as being less downright evil than a cynical, manipulative and ruthless politician. For instance, the persecution of the Jews is shown to be not a product of his fanaticism but as a political calculation to search a scapegoat for Germany's defeat in the WWI. The movie consciously tries to mirror the gangster movie popular in its era (thus the title), instead of conspiring to rub off other gangsters, here Hitler conspire to do away with rival politicians, instead of fighting over the liquor market, here they fight over controlling Germany.
The movie didn't have all the information that came out after the war ended (Eva Braun doesn't appear, but his niece Geli Raubal, whom the movie accuses Hitler of murdering, does; nothing is said about the concentration camps) but it is nevertheless very well informed given the circumstances, especially about the beginnings of Nazism, showing for instance how Hitler join the National Socialist Party as an army spy, in order to infiltrate it.
Made with a tiny budget, and with no name actors, it is finally made interesting by its intelligent, literate script, sober directing and some of the acting. Bobby Watson is very good as Hitler, the supporting cast is a bit less (the actors playing Hess, Goebbels and Rohm look quite like the characters they are portraying, the actor playing Himmler very little, the one playing Goering, nothing at all). Recommended, especially if you are interested in the subject.

The latest money reports are in, and the cash is flowing like rainwater in the hottest legislative races in the state. In Northern Virginia, state Sen. Jeannemarie Devolites Davis (R-Fairfax), in one of the toughest contests of the year against Democratic challenger J. Chapman Petersen, accepted $183,000 from the congressional committee of her husband, U.S. Rep. Thomas M. Davis III. To date, Devolites Davis has accepted more than $400,000 from Davis, much of it directed toward network television advertising.
Devolites Davis is spending at least as much as she's receiving, the most recent reports show. From Oct. 1 through Oct. 24, she took in nearly $500,000, and spent nearly $800,000. At the end of the period she had just $82,000 on hand.
Petersen reported $417,000 raised and $429,000 on hand. His expenditures included $100,000 for a TV ad buy, and his contributions included $101,100 from the Virginia Senate Democratic Caucus and $117,750 from Moving Virginia Forward, the leadership PAC of Gov. Timothy M. Kaine (D).
In other Northern Virginia Senate races:
State Sen. Ken Cuccinelli II (R-Fairfax) raised $264,000 and had $385,000 on hand. His contributions included $100,000 from Citzens for the Commonwealth, a new PAC dedicated to "free enterprise," and $50,000 from the Virginia Senate Republican Leadership Trust.
Cuccinelli's opponent, School Board member Janet Oleszek, reported $336,000 raised and about $77,000 on hand; contributions included $82,000 from Moving Virginia Forward.
Sen. James K. "Jay" O'Brien (R-Fairfax) raised the least of the Northern Virginia Senate competitors; his report shows he raised $216,000 from Oct. 1 to Oct. 24 and had $147,000 on hand. His challenger, Democrat George Barker, reported $236,000 raised and $169,000 on hand.

Official title: Intravenous Immunoglobulins as Effective Treatment in Sydenham's Chorea
Study design: Allocation: Randomized, Endpoint Classification: Efficacy Study, Intervention Model: Parallel Assignment, Masking: Double Blind (Subject, Outcomes Assessor), Primary Purpose: Treatment
Primary outcome: improved scores on the sydenham chorea assessment charts
Secondary outcome: improved quality of life
Detailed description:
INTRODUCTION Acute Rheumatic Fever (ARF), chronic rheumatic heart disease (RHD) and
neuropsychiatric/ movement disorders related to group A beta haemolytic streptococcal
infections (GABAS) remain major public health problems in South Africa. RHD may require
repeated hospital admissions, invasive surgery and often results in premature death. In
Africa ARF has a mortality of 2-3%. 1 Likewise, neuropsychiatric disorders such as
Sydenham's Chorea (SC) resulting from GABAS result in school difficulties, frequent
absenteeism, behaviour problems such as obsessive compulsive disorder and may progress to
Tourette Syndrome (personal experience). Patients may suffer from disabling neurologic and
psychiatric symptoms many years after their initial episode of ARF (personal experience).
The morbidity from these conditions demands enormous resources from the state in terms of
medical and surgical treatment and we believe results in preventable stress and suffering to
the patient and his or her family. Whilst the ideal goal is primary prevention a measure of
secondary prevention has been attained by the use of monthly prophylactic penilente. In
cases where ARF has occurred, some further intervention is desirable, to prevent the above
complications.
At the Rheumatic Fever Clinic (RFC) at Red Cross Hospital patients with established RHD
and old cases of Sydenham's Chorea ( SC) are seen. There are 2-4 new cases of ARF seen per
month. ARF remains a notifiable disease but it appears that these new cases are often not
notified. (personal communication PAWC health officials) SC is a major manifestation of ARF
and following the 1992 update of the modified Jones Criteria, it is sufficient alone to make
a diagnosis of ARF. 2 The duration of SC ranges from a few weeks to 2 years. Recurrences
occur in one third of patients. 3 Current treatment of SC is purely symptomatic and whether
it resolves in 6 weeks or 2 years is dependent on innate healing mechanisms within the
individual. SC is postulated to be mediated through auto- antibodies that mis-recognise
neuronal cell components. These complexes then result in an inflammatory response in the
basal ganglia with the resultant clinical picture of SC. 3 We hypothesise, that the use of
intravenous immunoglobulins ( IVIG) will decrease the number of circulating antibodies
thereby decreasing symptom severity and shortening the course of the illness. Prophylactic
penicillin must be continued to prevent re-exposure and further formation of antibodies.
AIM We aim to determine whether treatment of SC with IVIG expedites recovery and thus cuts
down on morbidity and frequent follow up.
METHOD Our aim is to collect a minimum of 20 patients with acute SC, diagnosed according to
the revised Jones Criteria for ARF and with an absence of indicators of other causes of
chorea. (Table 1) The study would run for 4 years or until the minimum number are recruited.
Patients would be identified and the chorea would be rated as mild, moderate or severe and
all signs of chorea carefully documented as per attached format. (A) Special investigations
would be performed (Table 2). Patients with IgA deficiency would be excluded from the study.
Informed consent would be obtained. Patients would be randomly selected to receive IVIG and
or standard treatment. Each patient will be allocated a code number.
Patients will be admitted to a neurology bed, as usually occurs for the acute management of
moderate and severe SC. Patients will be notified.
Standard pharmacological treatment (Table 3) of haloperidol and or sodium valproate will be
administered, in addition the trial group will receive IVIG. All patients will commence
penicillin prophylaxis. On day two (once the administration of IVIG is complete) the
investigator (KW) and a blinded observer (WM) will examine the patient for signs of chorea
as per addendum A.
The patient will remain hospitalised until he or she can cope with activities of daily
living.
Patients will be reviewed at one month, 3 months, 6 months and 1 year and any other time if
necessary, this being consistent with current management. They will be assessed by a blinded
observer (WM) and by the chief investigator(KW). Follow up will be at the RFC.
IMI penicillin to be given at discharge, 1. 2 million units if over 30 KG and 600,000 units
if weight less than 30 KG NB. Improvement of symptoms with IVIG alone, can only be expected
after the third week post treatment. 5 The aim of this therapy is to shorten the overall
course of the illness and to prevent complications.
SAMPLE SIZE We aim to get a minimum of twenty cases, 10 will receive IVIG and 10 standard
treatment.
ANALYSIS Aim to get a minimum of 20 new cases. Statistical analysis of the outcome measures
will be undertaken.
ETHICS / CONSENT In recent years IVIG have been used successfully and safely in a number of
auto-immune conditions. 4 Informed consent will be obtained. Parent consent forms will be
available in English, Afrikaans and Xhosa COSTING Salaries. No contract staff or casual
assistants would be employed. Already salaried staff would look after the patients. Patients
with SC are usually admitted to hospital and all the above treatment is administered except
for the administration of IVIG, the assessment of serum gamma-globulins and brain
spectroscopy scans (single photon emission computed tomographic scanning). The department
of Nuclear Medicine has consented to perform these scans. It has been shown that in
hemichorea hypermetabolism occurs in the contralateral basal ganglion and this disappears
with resolution of symptoms. 8 Nursing duties would remain the same as for current admissions
of SC. The only additional nursing duty would be the monitoring of the IV infusion.
The registrars and senior house officers will assist in the management of these patients. As
stated earlier ARF is a public health problem in South Africa. It is important therefore
that health professionals are aware of the preventative and curative treatments available
for the treatment of SC.

It will be the most unit-tested release of KatePart ever I guess, but still a long way to go until we have a good test coverage. (we just scratch the surface)
Many thanks to the people contributing to this release (not only to the ones named above or below!), without that much helping hands, never such an amount of cool stuff would have happened
I guess one of the real kickoffs was the great Kate/KDevelop sprint in Berlin, handled by Milian and sponsored by the e.V., thanks a lot!
For the next release, with KDE 4.6, already new cool stuff is in production:
- vim-like swapfiles by Diana (see here and here)
- the awesome SQL plugin by Marco
If you think, you can help us, just join us and make Kate for KDE 4.6 even more awesome.

How hard it is to use the proper branding?
Adding SC between KDE and release number is not so difficult.
I feel comfortable with calling it KDE ;P
If only the day had more than mere 24h Christoph
I’ve many more ideas for Kate in the future, lets hope I find the time. And I’m of course looking forward to the next sprint, lets crash at Joseph’s place
Bye evil maintainer.
Wow, as a developer, I use Kate a lot. I am eager to try the new Kate out and see if the rewrite of all those parts solves those little things that were “not quite right”.
For next version it would be great if Kate got other syntax highlighting styles. A dark one is needed for sure. Coda (Mac) for example has an awesome dark background style which really improves readability.
Cheers!
Posts like this bgirthen up my day. Thanks for taking the time.
Is there any way to try that awesome SQL plugin without waiting till January?
Given you have KDE 4.4 dev packages installed, sure, compile just Kate yourself, some minutes work :=)
See
Beeing waiting for 4.5 for a lot of time, expect a lof from it and I’m anxious about it’s final release. =)
Does scripting offer the possibility to invoke external commands and insert there Output into kate (e.g. by replacing a selection)?
that was there for ages with the “external tools” plugin in kate
In 4.5.RC1 and 4.5.RC2 i can’t select encoding for files because auto-detect thinks that it is smarter than the user and overrides my choise.
The only way to solve this now is to turn auto-detect off.
Was it fixed in time for 4.5 release? Or will it be fixed only in 4.5.1?
I meant RC2 and RC3.
Read my comment in the bug. Whereas this is inconvenient for this one use case, that you have a file with multiple conflicting encodings, the current behavior rescues people from loosing data. You can*t open a file with a wrong encoding (at least not, if Kate is able to find a usable)
For your specific need: just copy out the second part in new file and change encoding there.
I posted a comment to the bug with use-cases.
In my Ubuntu system, I installed Kate and I found that the terminal tab is showing blank.
After google search I came to know that , Kate requires Konsole for it’s terminal window. After installing Konsole, it worked properly.

It’s like, “Hey dick, you’re not producing your free Internet content at a pace that is conducive of my unappreciative viewing experience, and that makes me hate you!” I actually like those types of trolls – those that call themselves “fans” – better than the “This thing you made sucks” crowd, because they feel like they actually deserve the right to criticize someone’s work.
That said, someone introduced me to the web comics of artist J.O. Applegate during the 2012 NBA Playoffs, and I write with completely aware irony today – HE DOES NOT POST HIS COMICS ENOUGH.
Applegate’s web comics, known collectively as Bounce Bounce Bounce or BounceX3, are mostly standalone jokes about certain players or the NBA experience in general, but his takes on fan and player behaviors are so dead on and hilarious, especially his latest work after the jump, that I almost consider them therapeutic to look at when I think about how insane most NBA fans are.
Most of all, I’m jealous of the awesome way that Applegate ties GIF animation into his comics, because I’m still trying to figure out how to do that and I should just probably realize that I’m a big ol’ dummy already. Alas, I digress. After the jump, I’ve included Applegate’s most recent efforts, dating from the start of this season to last season’s playoffs, and if you’re an NBA fan, you should absolutely follow him and complain like an impatient child like I do when a day goes by without a new comic.
Been staring at Andre touching his mustache (#13) for about 5mins now…it’s mesmerizing.

The New York Times reported that Detroit is proposing a plan aimed at “reducing” its $5.7 billion in outstanding retiree health costs, when in reality, the costs are simply being shifted elsewhere. The Times also reported Chicago and other economically unsound cities are also “contemplating shifting retirees onto the insurance exchanges.”
Fox points out that Detroit’s savvy plan is dependent upon Obamacare’s exchanges happening as scheduled at the beginning of 2014.
Comment with FacebookBy Jim GaramoneAmerican Forces Press Service
WASHINGTON, Oct. 27, 2003 Firefighting equipment California officials requested from the Defense Department soon will be battling the wildfires in the southern part of the state, Pentagon officials said.
The National Interagency Fire Center requested two modular airborne firefighting systems from DoD. The systems fit inside C-130 Hercules transport planes and can spread water or flame retardant over an area 60 feet wide by a quarter mile long.
Officials said each unit carries 2,750 to 3,000 gallons of water or fire retardant in five 500-gallon interconnected tanks.
The U.S. Forest Service owns the systems, but they are on extended loan to National Guard and Air Force Reserve units. Air Guard or Reserve units will fly the aircraft.
Military personnel stand ready to help fight the fires in Southern California, officials said. Firefighters at Miramar Marine Corps Air Station, Calif., have been helping the local communities. The fire did come onto Miramar, but officials said it did little damage to buildings. Officials said that the blaze on the base is 90 percent contained, with just a few hot spots remaining.
A neighboring community lost more than 150 homes. Many military families lived in that community, and the temporary lodging facilities at Miramar and at Camp Pendleton are ready to receive military families.
Camp Pendleton has had some range fires but no damage at that base, Pentagon officials said.
California Gov. Gray Davis declared emergencies in Los Angeles, San Bernardino, San Diego and Ventura counties. A total of 13 people have died as a result of the fires.
Six major wildfires and a number of smaller ones are burning. The region's hot, dry Santa Ana winds are driving the fires. More than 825 homes have been destroyed from the Mexican border to the southern Los Angeles suburbs.Food Service Sanitation Manager Course

These vaguely hippie-themed pizza restaurants are fixtures on college campuses throughout the Southeast. Nashville's franchise is clean and inviting, offering a tasty product at reasonable prices. The extensive menu includes calzones, salads, sandwiches and a choice of 10 "specialty" pizzas, or you can make your own pie from a list of 30 ingredients (including portobello mushrooms, pesto, jerk chicken and tempeh). The sandwiches are excellent, though Yankee diners will surely balk at what passes for a hoagie. Mellow Mushroom has 22 beers on tap, 40 different bottled varieties and a full bar.

Good luck, kid. That sounds (for the most part) like pretty heavy reading to accomplish in one week. You are planning on sleeping a few hours each night, right? :-)
Up to 80 so far, Suldawggydawg!
Yeah, I plan on sleeping. I also imagine that I won't read any books with more than 40 or 50 pages, other than the few that are almost finished. I'm most likely going to go through my shelf and pick out the little books, you know, the little books of poems or sayings or whatever that people give you for gifts that you (or at least I!) read the first couple pages and then stick on a shelf. If it gets to crunch time and I still need a few more, then I'll start hitting the picture books hardcore!
So yeah, it looks like I'll have to fade away in quality of literature at the end to get to the goal, but at least it got me to consistently seek out reading material. I just happened to pick a lot of really long, dense books.
Two words: comic books!
Comic books are SO HARD TO READ though! No, seriously. There's something about having to jump from blurb to blurb and keep track of the characters visually at the same time as linguistically. Takes me 10 minutes to get through a page. Too much gettins of deegrees must've made my brain only want to read one way. Blech.
Oh, that's too bad about the comic books. Maybe try matchbooks?- Location:
Top Ten Seasonal Scenic DrivesPage Overview
Everyone loves a good road trip, especially when there's gorgeous scenery to enjoy. Check out these ten seasonal scenic drives throughout America.
Winter
North Shore O'ahu, Hawaii, Route 83 : Most roads in Hawaii are worthy of must-see status, but this rises to the top for what it is not: touristy. It's a welcome relief from Honolulu's endless people press. The route winds through tiny surf villages like Waimea and Kawela, which are low on hype but big with character, allowing for a more honest look at island culture. The route's coastal hug furnishes endless ocean views and accesses empty beaches.
Florida's Highway 1 or Overseas Highway: This 133-mile stretch between Key Largo and Key West is one of the few roads that never disappoints, especially for winter-bored eyes. The entire route creases two stretching lips of turquoise water, providing an almost magical entrance ramp into the tropics. Lawton, Duck Key, Marathon and other small towns pocket the entire route, allowing for good stopping points. The route culminates in Key West, the most southern spot in the United States, making it the perfect exclamation point for the Overseas Highway.
Spring
Utah's Route 128 between Cisco and Moab: Start this drive in Cisco, a pebble of a town along Interstate 80, for it offers no hint of the awe you're about to witness. From Cisco there's nothing but sage, prairie dogs, and more sage. But once you catch up to the Colorado River, you plunge into a red rock valley that represents Mom Nature at her Salvador Dali best. Avant-garde rock and cliff formations, the color of brownie mix, wall the final 25 miles, rivaling most National Parks for mind-staggering scenery.
California's Highway 101 between Eureka and Crescent City: Often overlooked by California's more populous southern coastal routes, this 82-mile stretch of road makes disposable camera pictures look good. Views of northern California's moody north coast are many. But the giant redwoods dominate, both literally and figuratively, as the true visual headliners, especially in Redwood National Park.
Summer
Glacier National Park's Going-to-the-Sun Road: Open only in summer, this 53-mile wonder snakes through Montana's northernmost Rockies. Hairpin turns, narrow shoulders fronted by plummeting cliffs, and snow-dusted peaks jabbing high into the Montana sky make you feel like you're mountaineering in a car.
Alaska's Route 1 into Homer: This 169-mile wander between Anchorage and Homer creates the lofty sense of driving through a National Geographic special. Turquoise streams charge through thick forests. The Cook Inlet, to the west, often reveals beluga whales. And the Homer Spit provides an unexpected beach setting favored by bald eagles.
Colorado's Highway 550 between Ouray and Durango:This is the ultimate mountain road. Craggy mountain ranges, veined with cascading snow-melt fed streams, scaffold both sides of the winding route. Abandoned mines pock scree-filled slopes like tombstones to lost dreams. And at approximately half-way, the route recesses into a deep valley, accessing Silverton, a Victorian mining town with a heavy anchor to its past.
Fall
Vermont's Route 125 between East Middlebury and Hancock: This wander serves as the ultimate fall stereotype. The Green Mountain National Forest pageants a spectacle of primary colors. Middlebury College's Breadloaf Campus, a summertime writing colony, adds a scholarly touch. And just past the sleepy village of Ripton resides Robert Frost's summer cabin.
Montana's Route 191 between Bozeman and West Yellowstone: Golden aspens and stately pines hem the road as it mimics the curves and twists of the fast-moving Gallatin River. Casting fly fishermen serve as reminders to why the film "A River Runs Through It" was filmed in and around here. The route, towards the south, veers through Yellowstone's northwest corner, providing plenty of opportunities to spy moose, bison, and elk.
Vermont's Route 100 between Stockbridge and Stowe: Famed traveler and journalist Charles Kuralt championed this road as the prettiest in America. Impossibly quaint villages with steepled churches, covered bridges, and tiny vegetable stands advertising homemade pies line the entire route. Not even Stephen King could write anything frightful about this autumnal wonder-spot.

Mountain Perennials: Choosing
As a rule, plants for mountainous areas must be more rugged than plants for lower elevations. Mountain perennials, for example, must be able to withstand daily temperature fluctuations of 30 to 40 degrees Fahrenheit, high summer heat, intense sunlight, decomposed granite soils, shorter growing seasons, and cool nights. Then there’s water to consider, given that many mountain homes have wells with limited water supplies.
Here are several perennials that require little water and grow well in gardens above 8,000 feet in elevation. Keep in mind, however, that nearly all perennials need more water during their first season to become established.
Groundcovers include the sun-loving sea thrift, basket of gold, candytuft and dianthus, as well as the shade-loving lungwort, moneywort and dead nettle.
Taller water-wise perennials for sun include oriental poppy, yarrow, penstemon, columbine and blanketflower. Many shade perennials require a little more water than their sun-loving cousins. Some shade perennials requiring low to medium water are ligularia, meadow rue and bleeding heart.For striking color combinations, consider planting mauve-flowered beebalm with silver artemisia and lavender catmint. Another possibility is deep-blue-flowered mountain bluet with orange-yellow blanketflower, white snow-in-summer and light-green-leafed oregano.
Perennials are a sure-fire way to jump-start the high elevation gardening season -- and with careful selection, success is easy.
For more information, see the following Colorado State University Extension fact sheet(s).

The 2009 BMW Z4 roadster is available in two trims, sDrive30i and sDrive35i. The 30i comes with a 3.0L inline-6-cylinder engine that makes 255 hp and 220 lb-feet of torque, while the 35i comes with a twin-turbocharged version of the same engine, making 300 hp and 300 lb-feet of torque. Both engines are mated to a 6-speed manual transmission, and a 6-speed Steptronic dual-clutch transmission with steering wheel shift paddles is optional.
The entire Z4's proportions have been enlarged somewhat, providing more room and therefore, more comfort for passengers. The 2009 Z4 is about 5 inches longer than last year's model. The new folding hard top and increased size added weight too, with the 2009 Z4 weighing in approximately 500 lbs heavier as well.
Standard equipment on the 30i includes 17" run-flat performance tires, xenon HID headlights with adaptive light control, rain-sensing wipers, a 10-speaker stereo that can play MP3s and includes 2 subwoofers. Leatherette seat trim comes as the standard interior fabric, but can be upgraded to one of four colors of leather. iDrive is available on the Z4 for the first time, and it controls the audio system, telephone as well as many other vehicle systems. Dynamic cruise control, remote keyless entry and various anti-theft systems are also included.
Opt for the Premium package on the 30i, and a universal garage door opener, automatically dimming rearview mirrors, power seats, and automatic climate control can be added for $3,900. The Sport package adds 18" wheels, an adaptive suspension with adjustable dampers, and sportier seats.
The sDrive35i not only gets the upgraded twin-turbo engine, but leather seats are included, as are automatic climate control and a brushed aluminum interior trim package.
Additional optional equipment on the 35i includes a navigation system with 9" display, ivory leather interior treatments and a premium audio system..

|~|airport-test-1.gif|~||~|All eyes have been on the mobile sector in Lebanon recently, and the tortuous process of re-vitalising the country’s two troubled GSM networks. But 2005 should also see the long-awaited development of high-speed internet services moving up the country’s agenda. Broadband subscriptions via DSL have yet to be made available for Lebanese users while the capacity of the country’s public switched telephony network (PSTN) remains stretched. A public data network (PDN) that would take the pressure of the PSTN and support broadband has also yet to be pushed through, despite originally being scheduled for tender in 2001. Nevertheless, the Ministry of Telecoms (MoT) says the PDN, costing an estimated US$20million, will be tendered this month and could be up and running by the end of the year. “[The PDN] is no longer a project of the mind,” says Naji Andraos, director general for equipment and construction at the MoT. “This has been talked about for two years but it will be tendered in February. We hope that it will go into action by the end of 2005,” he adds. The PDN is expected to have numerous benefits for Lebanon’s telecoms sector, if and when it is launched. One will be to allow fixed line operator, Ogero, to offload data traffic from the PSTN and give it spare capacity to lease to ISPs. The MoT claims that IP traffic generated in Lebanon has been doubling annually in the last few years. It intends the PDN to have two internet gateways, an IP/MPLS core, eight remote access servers (RAS) and 20 digital subscriber line access multiplexers (DSLAMs), to initally support data being generated from up to 3000 DSL customers. To prepare for the move, a node to connect local ISPs has already been established. 90Mbits/s of international capacity has also already been sourced, with half linking Lebanon to Europe and half to the US. “The PSTN has had limited manufacture and maintenance support,” says Andraos. “There is big pressure [on] the MoT and Ogero to migrate the network to launch internet and IP services. We have a huge demand for broadband but we have not been able to satisfy [it],” he adds. The MoT also says that the network will allow service providers to offer enhanced internet protocol (IP) services, such IP virtual private networks (VPNs) and packet telephony. But observers expect it to have an impact on elemental broadband services first, considering the sector’s current under-development. “The PDN will mainly help the MoT introduce broadband services — it still hasn’t introduced DSL,” says Sami Sunna, senior research analyst at Arab Advisors. “Lebanon was expected to be a technological leader in the region but the situation in the telecoms sector has been chaotic, because of liberalisation and privatisation being slow. Many ISPs still get their connectivity through satellite as Ogero hasn’t had enough bandwidth. Also, many wireless providers have been operating without being regulated,” he adds. The government also intends to use the move to expand and develop its PSTN this year, which reportedly covered 95% of the country and had 750,000 subscribers at the end of 2004. According to Andraos, another project will see 40,000 payphones installed across Lebanon during 2005, while ISDN connections are expected to be in place in some rural areas by the middle of the year. Alcatel, Siemens and Ericsson have also been upgrading the country’s PSTN switches — which again will be finished by mid-2005, he adds. This, the MoT hopes, will stabilise the fixed network, which has been losing customers to the country’s two mobile networks. “The PSTN network was completely rebuilt after the civil war, and most of the lines are digital, but traffic has been going down for quite a while, as people are using their mobile phones instead of fixed lines,” says Sunna. On a wider scope, the development of broadband in Lebanon also represents one of the key goals set out by the Telecoms Regulatory Authority (TRA) which is due to be up and running in Lebanon in the first half of this year. As such, the following monhts is also likely to see the broadband market being restructured. Once it is formed, the regulator is set to issue new licences to Lebanon’s existing ISPs and datacomm operators, and oversee the restructuring of Ogero and its re-branding as Liban Telecom. Looking further down the line, it has also prepared a five year plan which could potentially see the creation of three, privately-owned national infrastructure operators competing to sell services across any technology to indirect service providers and end-users. Considering the country’s track record, though, the question is whether all the reforms and investments planned for this year will come to fruition. But Androas is optimistic. “The MoT is taking a major step in its life,” he points out. “We are moving from a state monopoly into a deregulated environment. We will see the TRA created — I hope — in the first months of 2005, [and] the creation of Liban Telecom. 2005 will be the year of the deregulation of Lebanese telecoms,” he adds.||**||
- JOIN THE DISCUSSION
- Add YoursAt our joint, O. Onions, we survive mostly with two bartenders. This is for a couple of reasons. The main reason is that Phil and I prefer to have the most tip money possible. The other reason is that, though the money is good, it’s hard to get anyone to work behind the stick here. After the Flipswitch, when some folks got some gifts, this joint became a hangout for local reanimators and that freaked out potential employees. I don’t know what the deal is, I mean we don’t allow reanimated cadavers into the establishment, but still, people don’t want to work here. O. Onions is just a place where folks who can bring back the dead can have a cool one, or a fine cocktail. (To be fair, if you want a cocktail, I would get it from Phil — I am all right, but he has the knack.) There is nothing creepy about the place, but you tell that to a booze slinger looking for a few side shifts.
It was only a few months back we got a good back-up bartender, a fella named Danny. He works weekends and when Phil and I need a day. The hours are uneven, but Danny is happy to do it. The funny thing is, this guy is amazing. He can do all those Cocktail bottle flip things and he can speak mixology, but he’s just pleased as peaches to be working here on the sly.
One Sunday, he was cashing out and I was taking over. Like most Sundays, it was a near-empty bar. Only Tommy was at his stool, drinking his screwdrivers like he does. Tommy was one of the more annoying regulars, but that’s bar life for you. With the place so dead, I just had to ask, “Danny, this is too easy a gig, for too few hours… why are you here? You on the run?”
Danny laughed and said, “Maybe, Liam. I was running toward a joint like this. I was running to the quiet.”
I looked toward the jukebox; it was blaring Steely Dan. There was nothing quiet about it.
“Different kind of quiet, Liam. Down the highway, there’s a joint for mindreaders. This place gets reanimators, because they got to be around folk who understand, mindreaders are the same way, and boy howdy, do they drink. I guess the more they drink, the less they can read other thoughts. Lushes, every one of ‘em. But they tipped and I was working weekends.
“Let me tell you, mindreaders like big blue drinks with fruit and paper umbrellas. It was madness. Each drink was a monument to some unearthly color. And they all tasted the same in the end, like Kool-Aid. But the rabble was happy and the money was nice.
“Course the thing about working a bar made up of mindreaders, was all the mindreaders. Couldn’t be annoyed at anyone for not tipping. Couldn’t think about how stupid the conversation at the back table was. Think about that this one dude doesn’t have a chance with that gal, though try he might — forget it, they will read you and give you hell. And heaven help you if a woman comes in a tight dress, because everyone in the joint will know your opinion on the way it fits her. Exhausting.
“This is why I can do all that mixology nonsense. I figured if I was focusing on making a cocktail with foam and bacon-infused zambuca, I would be too distracted to think of anything other than making the drink. It worked. I lasted longer than most bartenders. You’ve never seen such turnover, Liam. But I had my mix creations and that kept me sane and unreadable.
“But then I got word from my people that my grandmother died. I wasn’t close to her, but still, it was a sad day and I figured I could get rid of my grief by working, so I took an open shift at the joint. It was going fine until this one guy, who worked as political advisor to the mayor or something, got into me and said, “Danny, will you stop thinking about a little old lady and get me a beer already.”
“That was it. I couldn’t believe it. My mind opened and I thought everything I was keeping back. That one is rude. That one is fat. That one has bad breath and tips for hell. That they were all posers and useless drags. Liam, it was funny. Everyone in the bar turned their heads as one and looked at me. Which is when I thought they should all get stuffed, and left for good.”
I whistled. “Why didn’t you go to a regular bar, one without any Flipswitch folk in it?”
Danny said, “Are you kidding? This place is perfectly normal. And I don’t have to worry about anything but making drinks.”
At this point, Tommy shouted from his place at the bar, “Are you ladies going to stop trading recipes for tuna casseroles and get me a drink already?”
Danny said, “I got this.” He went over to Tommy and stared at him, no doubt thinking terrible things.
Tommy moved back in his seat, unsure of why Danny was just looking at him. “What?”
Danny smiled, “Nothing, Tommy. Nothing at all. You want another screwdriver?” Tommy nodded, relieved the staring match was over. Danny walked past me to get the orange juice and said, “Yeah, I love this place. The quiet is perfect.”

Frail
Frail is about those everyday moments when everything collapses. Little moments where our life changes, spins and breaks. Suspended moments in which something has just happened or is about to. Situations in which time, objects and places lose their physical nature. Tiny fragments of life which, when put together, redefine our idea of control of ourselves and the world around us.
We are vulnerable in the everyday.
Bio
Alberto Lizaralde was born in 1979 in Madrid (Spain). In 2002 he obtained a degree in Advertisement in Madrid. He worked as a film critic and directed two short films and some cultural live events. He currently lives in Madrid (Spain) and combines his work as creative supervisor at Contrapunto BBDO advertising agency with his projects in documentary photography.

Haven’t had time to digest the photos, but great captions. Seriously.
Fuzzy concept? Sorry, this does nothing for me at all.
#16..
Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!
i love it!
its straight to the point!
the Real Thing.. the “truth” if any, is all here…
just feel it…
this is photography u can feel, dance with, or surf on it, or skate on etc..its like a moving vehicle without fancy symbolism stays right to the point…
true , honest, simple, brilliant!
yes We Are Vulnerable in the every motherF%^&^%gDay!!!
bravo
Jim…
Try it again, take your time and breathe deeply and let things be and I’m convinced you’ll get it. Don’t underrate yourself so much :)!!
I can feel this essay, it’s my cup of tea. I just wish it was in BW, just that extra abstraction to shake my soul and whizz me off my feet. For me good photography makes me see everything for the first time.
“The question is not what you look at, but what you see”
Thoreau
@Paul, I actually really enjoy it in color. Reminds me of the stuff LPV puts out which I absolutely love. Solid work here Alberto, I really enjoy it.
Even though I can appreciate some of the images, individually, the essay, as a whole is far
from ready for prime time imho.
I don’t ‘feel’ the concept is illustrated at all with the exceptions,perhaps, of #1 and #16.
The little obscure vignettes of everyday details does nothing to push the theme of ‘frail’ forward
I totally agree with the concept, but my impression is that most of the shots lack the visual quality that can support such a bold research. Only the portraits are fully convincing, imo.
………………. ?
There is an interview on his site that is worth reading….it gives a bit more insight into this project.
#1 does it for me.
PAUL. What exactly do you FEEL???
Remembering that most ACTUAL emotions can be described in a single word.
Like….hopeful
or……trusting
or……disappointed
I like the pictures very much. The feeling of vacuum, of vulnerability comes out in several of the pictures. The portraits were just great. Well done!
John…
I see the commonplace seen, heard and felt which we usually pass by unaware of it’s power. Our habitually overworked switchboard just takes in the bangs and screams we feel everywhere. I am a stranger to many daily occurrences round me so I stop and feel. The ordinary will turn into the extraordinary and there is no need to label things just feel. And those that already have labels I rip them off and rediscover all of them once again. I make them mine; my song, my poem, my howl and my whisper.
Please don’t understand just feel.

Carlo..
Thanks for pointing out the interview.. as always, I tend to spend more time with essays that I don’t get, than with those that hit home right away.. I can understand, reading the interview, what drives the photographer here, but that still doesn’t help me to connect with the work, except for a few frames..
Congratulations Carlo
This essay resonates with me a great deal. Angst, evident in those blank stares, seems to be common to the human condition.
Paul, Are there your own words or a quote? In any case, appropriate.
Kinda reminds me of the Kellogs ad a few years ago “Kellogs corn flakes, taste them again for the very first time” :)
Gordon…
Thank you, those are my words. I felt particulary inspired this morning, I began writing everything with “We” but I generally hate preachers and as it also sounded so highly pretencious I decided to adjust it all to “I”.
A probable explanation as to why work like this does not say anything I an interested in hearing.
The current state of my walls.

I think eva’s picture looks great.
nice one John!!!! (who’s singing?)
I don’t know.. I get the concept, but the photos just don’t work for me. The artist statement is thin, and could be followed by just about any photograph. I’m thinking ‘decisive moment’ in other words. For it to work for me, I’d need some shots that are less metaphorical and more about those moments of collapse. To me the portraits look like people deep in thought, but not frail, not on the brink of something.. I don’t get 13.. and the only object shot that resonates for me is 6.. yet it doesn’t ring true to the artist statement, what is about to happen? what is impending, what is frail? Is it a statement on death and decay? loss of worth perhaps?
I’m guessing 16 horsepower. Great band somewhere between underrated and unknown, at least in the states. Had pretty much forgotten about them. Thanks for the reminder. Almost guessed John Mellencamp before he started singing. Still, similar to JM’s later work.
Don’t see how those pics exclude you liking this essay, but I have no problem with you, or anyone else, not liking this essay.
Panos. Michael is right, David Eugene Edwards. (16 horsepower, Woven hand ). Even a cynical atheist such as myself feels humble around his faith…..it resonates authenticity…and while I do not share his beliefs I feel very strongly that his is not a fashion position or a con trick as so much is these days.
A shame on America that his work is not better known there.
John…
Never heard that music before, it made me stop in my tracks, so did your walls. Paintings, photos and music all stir my sky, in fact I want to ride life or make photos like that guy sings.
Paul. make photos like YOU sing…fuck everyone else. be moved, be Inspired, be humnbled, be angered…but be true. Not a chance of a shot otherwise.
Paul; David Eugene Edwards from 16 Horsepower is in “Searching for the Wrong-eyed Jesus”
A shame on America that his work is not better known there.
——————-
nahhhhhh….just a shame on me, actually…not america (this time;)
John..
honored but intimidated to hang there, you got some great stuff up your walls.. not only the photos, but those paintings!! Thank you :)
John G, I have the same issues with overtly Christian work, yet some of my favorite artists are, or have gone through phases where they were, overtly Christian. Nick Cave, Dylan, and Tartovsky spring immediately to mind. Of course they are hardly typical in how they express their beliefs, unintelligible to normal religious people.
Nick Cave’s “No More Shall We Part” is one of my favorite albums (discs, records — what do we call them these days?) and I think it’s a bit representative of the ongoing conversation here regarding essays like this, and the differences between essays and singles for that matter. “No More Shall We Part” is a collection of excellent singles that form a whole that is greater than its parts. Taken together, these singles tell a larger story, but the story is so complex and open to interpretation that it is difficult for many to recognize it as a coherent story. Alberto’s essay, and others with similar approaches, are similar, I believe. For lack of a better word, I consider these types of things “literary” stories, though I’d like to find a better word since with photography we’re dealing with images and feelings much more, or even excluding words. Nevertheless, it’s a valid form and one I think has a lot of possibilities, though just as any art it’s not going to appeal to everyone.
Been drivin’ me crazy.. that’s not from ‘Woven Hand’, but from ‘Folklore’.. finally found it!
does “we are vulnerable everyday” the same as “we are vulnerable in the everyday”, but one is just plain simple english and the other heightened poetry? inquiring (simple) minds…..
Nice walls John…
John – I had to look at your walls video twice. I watched it silent the first time and thought silent was how supposed to be. I did not realize that my black, who has been lounging on or very near to my keyboard since I sat down, had muted the sound. It was quite effective silent.
Then I saw the references to the sound track, so I went back and watched it again.
It was effective with the sound track – and yes, I, an American living in the midst of ignorance, was unfamiliar with the piece, but taken by it.
Still – the silent version spoke loudest and most powerfully to me.
Sometimes it ain’t to bad to be underrated, unknown, forgotten. It usually keeps a sense of authenticity to the work and nice and out of the reach of the mediocre blood sucking fans and managers.
Eva,
I feel almost the same way as you. Just pointed out the interview because it gave me more insight than what its written here. I thought people will find it useful as well.
Gordon,
Congratulations for what?!?!?! :)
I found the artist statement interesting. Than I looked at the photo. But I did not see so much correlation with the statement. There are a few photos i like and can correlate somehow (1-2-7-11), a few I like but find difficult to correlate (4-6-10), others where I have doubts (frailty and doubts are correlated!) and a few one I do not understand in respect of the Artist statement (8-11-14). It is possible my limited knowledge of english language drove me in a wrong direction or my “visual understanding” is limited as well. It is anyway interesting to be confronted with something we, me in this case, do not fully understand.
robert
PD: @ john, beautiful walls, paintings and photos…
Hi Alberto, thanks for submitting these for us.
I definitely enjoyed some of these images, with no’s 2,8 and 16 grabbing my attention.
There seemed to be a quiet, considered poetry in there somewhere that I liked. Shades of Alec Soth perhaps? (gasp!)
Having said that, I found the thin captions and personal statement a bit frustrating. I wanted more information.. a denser, more rounded package. (Maybe that’s a bit old-school but hey.)
Either way, the project made me think.
BURN: Keep chucking in the curve-balls guys.. very good to see.

And not for the joy of having a new UI. But to get rid of the old buggs in ICS in Xperia P. Anyway after wasting my time thinking sony will deliver i found a thread where i saw a method to update to jelly bean. It involved flashing my phone. So fed up of waiting i said ill Flash it and get the update myself.
It was a simple procedure and for a guy like me who has never used flashing tools it was as simple as anything really. I did not have to Unlock bootloader ( whatever that is) or any other thing which would void warrenty and all that stuff. I just download the Jelly Bean Generic Firmware and Flashtool and Flashed it simply on my Stock Xperia P.
Its working like a charm. Everything working. The problems people have been reporting of the gallery issues and dialer lag, lock screen and so on, i have not found any of these things after updating. Its actually alot smoother than ICS and till now it does not seem there are no Buggs ( and by buggs i mean which are evident and annoy you in everyday use). Playstore is working and all is well. For people who are fed up use this link and enjoy Jelly Bean.;tstart=0

I love the idea, size and looks of the X-E1, it's almost perfect .... but.
Just tried out an OM5 with EVF, needless to say it has been returned.. Not my thing at all but quite sure it's fine for some.
Anyway EVF is just about useless in the studio using strobes. Reason being you have a viewfinder struggling with a 150w tungsten modeling lamp plus the WB will look so orange and grainy as you would have set WB to daylight for the strobes.
So the Xpro with OVF is the way to go if you plan on doing some studio shoots like me.
Looks like I may have to get both....... first the Xpro while they still have the discounted price.
"The X-pro1 has replaced all my other cameras (including full-frame DSLR) as my go-to-camera for work and play, without exception... I've sold everything else, and now shoot exclusively with the X-Pro1 whether it be in studio or on location, for magazine or campaign work... and am amazed by the quality of the images and ease of use every time... My clients love that I use such a small camera, and are more than confident in my abilities without the slightest concern, no more carrying tons of bulky equipment!!!"

Where to Eat
Guests are offered a complimentary on-the-go).Nutrition in schools
The problem I have with the school teaching nutrition is that they only teach one opinion. Usually, low fat. I happen to not believe in a low fat diet. We eat a higher fat, lower carb diet in my house. And what about vegetarians? Why not teach a variety of diets and how to follow them?
then, if a child is interested in being a vegetarian, they can do it it a healthy manner. Same for low carb, learn that it does not mean you eat bacon all day, lol.
kids learn about all the religions in school, why not also teach all the major diet plans?
Low fat foods tend to be unhealthier anyway because they have to replace all that fat with something.
I agree. I think nutrition in this country is very misguided in the first place. Don't get me started... :)
Good point. My kids' school (private) encourages healthy options like organic (though not mandatory) and non-processed foods. Parents take turns bringing in a snack for the week and they have recommended items for them to bring, as well as a guideline for what they can bring in their lunches. I like it because it gives me a good excuse to my kids (and mostly to my dh) on why they can't bring sugary treats or junk food for lunch. They can have the junk as a treat at home, but not a part of their regular meals.
And how about teaching things like gmos and the hormones in milk and meat these days....
I was a vegetarian in high school. I had to bring everything myself because they had absolutely no options. Even their salads all had chicken in them.
I guess the only thing that matters right now as far as school and nutrition is "cheap" and "healthy for most"
I have a child who has life threatening allergies to wheat, rye, barley and egg. He would get frustrated that the right answer was always whole wheat toast and eggs are considered a healthy breakfast.
I couldn't convince my other son to color the peanut butter because he is allergic. Ehhh.
I think education begins at home. Schools teach one thing but parents have a right to their input as well. Thank goodness for homeschooling.
Im all for schools making healthy choices... apples instead of cookies for snacks, allowing kids to keep water bottles at their desks while banning soda, but sometimes I wonder how they have time to teach any of the basic stuff like math and reading with all the extra shit they try to pack in. I can teach my kid about healthy food at home, algebra on the other hand is the schools job lol
I bet they don't know any better.

Today's young Europeans are the first generation to have come of age in a digital society. Computers, smartphones and global communications have shaped and educated them. And yet, there is great disparity in our schools and education systems. In fact, many schools struggle to provide the basics despite the dedicated efforts of teachers and families.
Besides, the social dimension is many times "divorced" from the main objectives guiding the developments in ICT, leading to a lack of equal access to technology and knowledge putting communities and populations of students at a disadvantage,especially minorities and sparsely-populated areas.
This workshop looked into the potential technology holds to transform education, overcome geographic disparities, improve access, personalise learning and make information widely available in digital form.
This note seeks to provide some reflections on the challenges, current policies and possible future prospects of 'historical memory' in a European context. Based on acknowledging the complex nature of collective memories in general and shared European historical remembrance in particular, including their susceptibility to political instrumentalisation, it is argued that a critical 'culture of remembering' needs to be developed. Such a culture requires increased efforts for nation states to come to terms with their own respective pasts in an unbiased way, yet at the same time embracing common European principles and values. In this context, the vital role of education as a tool to create an informed historical consciousness is emphasised, which provides the basis for dealing confidently not only with Europe's past, but also present and future.
The Committee held an exchange of views with Ms Dace Melbārde, Minister of Culture and Ms Mārīte Seile, Minister of Education and Science on 19 January pm.
Each year, the EU Institutions account to the Parliament for the use made of the resources at their disposal. On 20 January, the Committee voted on its opinion on signing-off the Commission's budget for 2013 ("discharge"). Rapporteur: Fernando Maura Barandiarán.
On 20 January, CULT organised a dialogue with young people in the context of the European Youth Event (EYE). These "EYE speed-hearings" allowed for an exchange between MEPs and a small number of EYE2014 participants, based on the ideas contained in the final report of the event.
Welcome.

Chair, Committee on Culture and EducationThe U.S. ambassador to Spain and former Vice President of HBO, James Costos, has confirmed that scenes for Game of Thrones Season 5 will be shot in Spain. This comes fast on the heels of confirmed rumors about scouting in the area.
To be exact, The Alcázar of Seville (pictured above) could serve as the Water Gardens of Dorne, where the late Prince Oberyn Martell’s older brother, Prince Doran, spends his time. It is also likely that the country will host the filming of scenes in Sunspear, the seat of House Martell.
The Alcázar is a Moorish-built castle whose construction dates back to the 1300s, so it would seem to be a perfect fit for a Dornish landmark.
Here’s the official word from HBO:
HBO is pleased to confirm that a portion of season five of GAME OF THRONES will be shot on several natural locations in the Province of Sevilla. Specifics on the locations will be announced closer to the time of production.
UPDATE: Here’s a video of Mr. Costos explaining how he encouraged filming to take place in Spain (Spanish dub):

WASHINGTON -- As Democratic leaders continue to pressure wavering lawmakers to throw their support behind health care legislation, Rep. Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio, announced Wednesday he will now vote yes for the bill.
The Ohio Democrat opposed the bill when the House voted on it last year, but has now switched sides on the issue.
"If we stay riveted on this health care debate and don't get out of it at all, we've actually created kind of a prison here of our own making," Kucinich said. "I don't want to be a party to that. And so I have taken a debate as far - farther - than anybody else who oppose this bill and who have held the positions that I have about single payer."
Meanwhile, Democrats are considering a controversial measure to pass the health care bill without actually voting on it.
In a health care debate that has introduced Americans into the world of "filibusters" and "reconciliation," there is now a new term: "deem and pass."
This rarely used procedure would allow House members to simply vote on a rule that would "deem" the unpopular Senate health care bill "passed."
Consequently, House members wouldn't technically have to vote on the Senate bill they really don't like in the first place. They would then pass their changes to the Senate measure and if that passed then - presto! They just passed the original Senate bill and the changes all in one. Click play for an updated report with CBN News Washington Correspondent John Jessup.
Also, Pat Robertson weighed in on the Democrats' "Slaughter Solution." Click here for his comments. Is this move constitutional? Click here more insight from David Brody.
GOP Lawmakers Cry Foul
The political maneuvering has some Republican lawmakers blowing a gasket.
"This is the vaunted transparency that the president promised?" Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis, questioned. "The arrogance, the paternalism, the condescension to the American people is just breathtaking."
But the White House says that's not so.
"I'm sure there are those that will want to make this about the legislative process," White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said. "I don't think there is any doubt that this will be a final vote on health care."
So how did matters reach this point?
It's simple. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. currently doesn't have enough votes to pass the Senate bill on its own, so she needs to employ more creative means.
She's now in a position of having to put out fires left and right - literally. One camp of liberal Democrats are against taxes on high-end health plans that will affect union members, moderate Democrats are against the price tag, and conservative pro-life Democrats are against the abortion language.
"We will do what is necessary to pass a health care bill to improve quality, lower cost, and make America healthier," Pelosi said.
A Violation of the Constitution?
However, some critics argue Pelosi's potential maneuver may prove unconstitutional.
The Supreme Court has ruled in the past that the House and Senate must pass the same text of the legislation. And according some scholars the Constitution supports the court's decision.
Article 1, section 7 of the U.S. Constitution states, "Every bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it becomes a law, be presented to the president of the United States."
With the House not voting on the original Senate legislation and subsequently making changes to the measure, the two bills would not be identical.
"We've heard of not reading bills," Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., said. "Not voting on bills, you would think, would be something that would violate the purpose for which the legislative branch was created in the first place."
"It is very likely that even now there are lawyers writing the briefs that will be filed to challenge the use of the slaughter rule if that is what Congress does," said Wendy Wright, president of Concerned Women for America.
The tactics also have some Americans angry and near ready to storm the beltway castle.

More than 500,000 tickets have already been sold for the tournament, a pointer as to just how keen fans are to be there at the Festival of Champions, which this time brings together Brazil, Spain, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Nigeria, Tahiti and Uruguay.
As preparations continue, the Management Board of the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil™ Local Organising Committee (LOC) met in Rio de Janeiro on Thursday and focused their attention on the operational changes that need to be made ahead of the competition, which runs from 15 to 30 June.
“Today is a symbolic date, and we have had a productive meeting about the final stages of preparations for the competition,” said FIFA Secretary General Jérôme Valcke. “The people of Brazil are very excited, as you can see by how well tickets are selling, and we are excited too.
“Between now and then, however, we have a series of test events at the stadiums, which are vital in ensuring that fans, team delegations and journalists will all enjoy a wonderful experience this June.”
A test event will be held at each of the six FIFA Confederations Cup venues from April, with the LOC playing a part in some operational areas. The aim of these tests is to anticipate problems and to make sure that an event of the scale and complexity of the FIFA Confederations Cup Brazil 2013 unfolds without a hitch.
With the objective of ensuring every Host City is in tune with the tournament organisers and ready to receive and run the stadiums from 24 May, the LOC set out the decentralisation process that will take place in the next few months. At the moment some 45 LOC-recruited officials are working on the ground at the six FIFA Host Cities. By June, this number will have risen to 202.
“It’s been hard work up to now, but we, the Host Cities, the Brazilian government, FIFA and the LOC know that the next few months are going to be even busier and even more challenging,” commented LOC Chairman Jose Maria Marin. “However, the level of commitment and willingness shown by everyone involved, including the Brazilian people, fuels our belief that we will be ready on time.”
Brazilian Minister of Sport Aldo Rebelo, who accompanied the joint FIFA/LOC delegation on their visits to Recife and Belo Horizonte earlier this week, explained that the Brazilian government will also be stepping up its preparations for the FIFA Confederations Cup.
He said: “Over the next few days we’ll be making another six visits with a large team of representatives from every government ministry, and we’ll be studying all the operational plans central to the success of the competition in conjunction with the states, city councils, FIFA and the LOC. That’s the best way to ensure proper organisation and anticipate the problems that can come up in an event like this, and to make sure that we overcome every obstacle on the way.”
LOC Management Board member Ronaldo spoke enthusiastically about the visits to Recife and Belo Horizonte, and said he can feel the sense of anticipation rising wherever he goes.
Ronaldo added: “It was amazing to see how fast they got back on schedule at the Arena Pernambuco, while the Estadio Mineirao, which is a historic stadium and one very special to me, has been totally renovated. There’s plenty of excitement among the people too, as we’ve seen with the ticket sales and the number of Brazilian people signing up for the volunteer programme, with 25,000 people attending group-dynamics sessions.”
Meanwhile, in a move designed to safeguard the health of fans, Valcke announced that all the stadiums to be used at the FIFA Confederations Cup and FIFA World Cup will be smoke-free.
“We’ve done this at other events because we recognise that smoking can cause people discomfort,” he explained. “Even so, there will still be designated smoking areas at the stadiums.”lastminute.com launches ‘inspire me’ platform powered by FusePump

Yea I can say it when I am done lmao! Okay I am done. No wait ha ha ho ho tee hee ha ha! Okay-yea he is a prissy sissy troll! Hung like a horse in pink panties oh g()d I am going to lol sum more!oh my lungs can't take it!
and who might u be, vixen? stirring up a little trouble yourself? got a bug up your azz about other gals posting on this blog? u had your day, and that day is done.
i think alecia is innocent. i think this troll just wants to be a girl. probably wears pink panties all the time, too. trolls on this blog can't man up. just not in them. can u say prissy, sissy trolls!
U mor ons u know its mr ed !
Or its someone out to get Alecia. Someone who Alecia trolled under her own name. Someones feelings got hurt and can't get over it perhaps? If that's not it its just a amatuer like you said.@troll-you going to let Alecia take your credit or you Alecia?
If this troll is not Alecia, y would the troll let her take the credit for its work? That is not how trolls work. Must be Alecia or the troll is a amateur.
No need 2 defend urself. This loser has no life. Ignore the a** hole. Troll wont go away but starve him or her. The reply is what 'it' feeds on. No food under the bridge just on blogs. The 'normal' ppl know ur kool. Hv a blessed day sly. @troll-i will pray for u. *u only hv until dec to redeem urself.Better get working on it before its to late*
LMAO!!! AGREED!
or should i say vixen? nice try. we all see through your attacks. better go hit the streets. i'm sure there's a guy just waiting to be with you for 10 minutes or so.
@9:08- thanks. @Dan- first off moron, I'm not on here 24/7. I come in, read the posts, comment, & leave. I may come back periodically during the day. Like I've said before, I work a full time job. I don't dance or stand on a corner, either. Yes, I talk to people who talk to me. I"m not a stuck up b!tch. Yes, I was on here talking to Coolbreeze about football. How trashy of me! As far as arguing with people, I only argue with the trolls, just like everyone else. I'm not going to roll over for a bunch of low class, low moral, people who are attacking me or anyone else. If I'm stealing your limelight, maybe you never had it to start with. Why can't you just post, be cordial, & act like an adult. I'll bet people would talk to you, too. As far as Alecia goes, I don't believe this is her for a minute. Alecia troll, maybe. Like I said before, you trolls aren't even a challenge. Your trolling is very lame, but I know, that's all you know. It's so much easier to be a jack azz, then try to be human. Also, to put threats on kids lives, how low can ya go? Why don't you examine your own life before you try to ruin other folk's lives. And again, I'm not Alecia, I'm not Starrfire. That's right, you are not going to try to switch attention from the facts. That is such a troll tactic. Do you really think the people who post can't see through your feeble attempts to throw blame. You just keep trying, though. We are all laughing at you, not with you! Now, go have yourself a good day, and leave the rest of us the heII alone!
Do poles come that sturdy and big ?lmao
Why would u say some1 would do that to their child ? What kind of sick mind do u hv ? By the way-if u read what cool breeze sayed he has visits with his child, must be divorced. If ur dum little brain cant understand-that means he's not married ! Get off ur pity pot and knock this sh yt off. Did some 'fit' girl steal ur old man away ? Think u need to go after any woman who gets flirted with ? Not what they were talking of was flirting. They talked about football. Work on ur own relationship. Stay off the blogs and work on ur pathetic life !
Is this Alecia again?
@Dan so worried or is it an obsession with Sly Sadie?You're here all of the time you crazy b**ch,why don't you go to a strip club get on a pole and make people throw up in their drinks.She's getting some attention and you can't stand it,and just keep bad mouthing kids,your gonna get yours.
Just cuz u use a boy name doesnt mean u r-VIXEN !
@ sly sadie- challenge for what ? You do realize that you are on a blog which you seem to be on 24/7 accussing and fighting with people? You really are not that sly are you? A retard would accomplish more in life than you from what some of us have been reading from your posts. Get a job at a strip club. You might pick up a few bucks to go back to school and get a job instead of being on the computer day and night. I think you are Starfire also.
I will buy you a drink.
I'm fine. Just lounging.
Hey Coolbreeze- can you imagine how said a life our gutless troll must live to have such a sick & nasty view of life to say crap like that. Just shows what a low life he is.
I know Sadie...I'm over it. How are you tonight? Hope you are well.
What the he!! is yer problem? There is only one attention ho3 here and 'she' dont use her name no more.
Hey gutless troll- If you think some random person could possibly make a tiny dent in my life with their childish rants, you are dumber than I thought. You just don't know how to fight fair, because you are afraid that a girl might kick your azz. Bring it.
See what I mean...horrible.
Don't be horoned pig. A wh-or-e is a who-r-e and iz not hornoed

Mr ed is out of jail.lol
Oh, I feel so honored. I have my very own troll. It sounds a lot like Eddie. What did you just get out of jail or something. It's been really quiet around here for a while. As far as messing around with married men, you got the wrong gal. Too many single guys out there for me to resort to that kind of behavior. You keep trying, though. I enjoy a challenge, not that I think I can get that from you!

Nice talking to you too, Coolbreeze. Stay warm! Have a good night!
Yep...much better to have intelligent conversations with people who can type. But it still hurts when it gets personal. I can handle the funny jabs but the personal death threats are over the top. Anyway, take care Sadie. I think I will sign off for the night. Thanks for the chat.
Troll will be trolls. Can't control those who want to cause mayhem. I can just see them typing their crap, just laughing at how nasty they can be. How sad is that?
Thanks Sadie and you are correct. I'm very lucky. Hope the wishes of some trolls on here never come true.
Hey Peace- how are you? Coolbreeze- glad to hear your kids are doing so well. Some parents are not so lucky.
No worries Sadie...she was a great pet. She was an outdoor dog but always got scared when it stormed so we would let her inside on those nights. The night she died, it stormed. My mom suffers worse than me.
Well good eve all! @ Bone Yard, Buuurrrr! We're at 18 degrees & over last 2 days, got 6 or 7 inches of snow. (Most of it today) @ starrfire, Tell sis I said hi! @ coolbreeze, How's your little girl? @ Sadie & coolbreeze, I'm not into sports. I do route for Lions & Tigers, tho! Of course, MI Wolverines, Red Wings, & Piston's, too! Not much into sports, tho! LOL! Well, you 2 enjoy your sports talk. Have good pm!
Hi Peace...thanks for asking. She's doing great and may get a story she wrote published. I'm very proud and she will be with me next weekend. Oldest is taking premed in College to become a pharmacist. Very proud of her too. Hope you are well.
Geeze Coolbreeze- sorry I remind you of that! I have lost a lot of animals in my life. I know the pain. Everybody says, when ya die, you want to come back as one of Sadie's pets. I take them all in & spoil them. I give them the happy lives they deserve.
Tebow is learning what it is like being a professional quarterback tonight! He'll be hurting tomorrow. lol
Sad story Sadie...my first dog was a toy collie I named Sadie. My mom came home one day and Sadie was excited but slipped on the pavement in the garage and my mom ran over her. Horrible time as a kid to witness that.
He won't be the starting quarterback next year because he's horrible. They should've stuck with Orten. Their defense is why they made the playoffs.
Well Coolbreeze- I have no idea what the weather in Detroit is like. Yes, Tebow does suck! I got so sick of the hype on that guy. Like there are no other good quarterbacks out there!
Sadie...I'm good with anything. Starting with how's the weather in Detroit? Or we can move on to topics like how Tebow sucks or other deeper topics like stocks, bonds or even world events. But let's stay away from politics.
So Coolbreeze- what would you like to talk about?
So Sadie...just you and me babe.
Oh, I'm sure the Steelers are thinking that should have been them! Too bad, too.
I'm gonna go chat with my sis on Skype... Y'all have a great nite and thx for the chat!
Goodnite starrfire...go Browns in 2012 lol. Oh...and Buckeyes under Urban Meyer too. Big Buckeye basketball game against Hoosiers tomorrow. Woohoo.
*imagine
I can imagie the Steelers players watching the game right now and cursing!
Yeah Ben's foot wasn't healed and he wasn't very mobile on the field like usual. Broncos got away with that – ref's fault? Can't go back....
Starr- wasn't Ben's foot injured, too. You know the play they scored on was illegal. They didn't have enough players on the line of scrimage. They got away with one!
I mean too many injured Steelers players... Duh!
Broncos were lucky they beat the Steelers – because they had too many injured and not because ok Tebow's praying!
I agree, sadie! They're not playing well tonite, how embarrassing...
Oh honey, you know it's snowing all across the north. I could be from anywhere! I do have family in Chicago, though.
Tebow best get on his knees & pray all halftime. I think he's on his own tonight! Frankly, I'm really glad he's getting his butt handed to him. Way too much hype on him.
Sadie, could've said Saints too but you seem concerned about snow in Chicago. Detroit next? lol
That should be Coolbreeze! Man, I need a proof reader! lol
Coolbreel- I will never tell...lol
Sadie- my kind of gal! Keep the guys guessing...
Catfisch- are you by lake Michigan? Is it snowing there, too?
Coolbreeze- because I like to stay a little mysterious, all I can say is, my team made it to the playoffs. They are out now. They gave us a good season!
Sadie...Bengals, Steelers (which would mean you bond with starrfire), Falcons, or Lions. I'm guessing Lions.
@catfisch...13 F in Milwaukee suburb.
It's 7.4F degrees here. Outside Chicago.
@coolbreeze We're buddies/rivals ok?
Absolutely starrfire.
@sadie Yeah guess we are! Playoffs and Super Bowl are always exciting, even if my team doesn't make it!
Hi Sadie...yep. Who's your team?
Sorry, I detest the BRowns! We're rivals! Too bad u think less of be because of that (shrug)
Teasing starrfire...great rivalry. Just wish my Browns would get their sh!t together and make it better.
Hey Starrfire & Coolbreeze- guess we are football fans! I go through withdrawal at the end of every football season.
Starrfire...you like the Stoolers...ugh. I'm a Browns fan unfortunately but I think less of you now lol.
My Steelers got "tebowed"! Boo hoo!!
I'm betting NE will win but it'll be a miricle if Denver wins. Tebow is praying hard! Lol
Hiya coolbreeze! If u change your name to hotbreeze, maybe you'll feel warmer!
Ha...nah, I'm warm. Watching football on my couch and very comfortable.
@bone Thanks!
Hey guys...great game. I'm sure it's cold here in Wisconsin but I didn't leave the condo today lol.
@starrfire all i'll say is'Patriot' country freakin'cold.
It's 36 here in NC and I'm freezing already! LOL
Oh what a game! Really exciting! Now for the next one.... @bone yard That's freaking cold! I'd freeze to death! Mind if I ask where u are located?
@Sly Sadie it's not that bad,we get along better when the temps drop you know the body heat thing and all.We're cool literally,I know oxymoron lol.
Wow! What a game. What an ending! Congrats to SF! Way to fight back!
@Bone Yard- my heart goes out to you! It's 19 here. It has been a crazy winter so far. Anyone watching the game? It's been a pretty good game. I had no favorite, but I was leaning towards SF, something about home field advantage. To our troll friends, if you want to play, come on out. Let the games begin.... lol!
Our temperature is 1.7F feels like 2F,tomorrow 11F and by Wednesday heat wave 2OF,we're not going to know how to act being able to shed one layer of clothing lol.

We always talk about how AD's game will take a step forward when he bulks up or when he develops a skill to that next level, but I'm also excited to see how his athleticism progresses. I think it's easy to forget how these young players come into the league and develop their athleticism. He is still so awkward, and I think it's partially because he hasn't grown into his body yet. I'm not expecting Blake Griffin explosiveness, but I cannot wait to see what he'll look like after he has some time to work with professional strength/speed guys for an offseason. You guys touched on both positive (assists) and non-negatives (no TOs), and Ryan mentioned the effect that Miller has on offense. And yeah, it's not like he's doing anything spectacular, but he's seeing things that basketball players should see, and that's my biggest beef with Aminu. It's easy to see guys reaching the stratosphere on dunks, or blowing by people, but there's something to be said about players who just know how to play basketball, and I'm tired of watching the Julian Wrights and Aminus on the court, because we're playing 4 on 5. I don't think Miller will ever be a starter, but largely, you can plug him in here and there and expect him not to do anything stupid. Also, something about the way he runs reminds me of a choo-choo train, and I like choo-choo trains, so that's another bonus.
I really want to see Davis and Anderson on the court together moving forward. In my opinion it doesn't matter if they struggle defensively this season. Give Davis the summer to add some size and in the meantime let them learn each others games on the court. Ryan Anderson is probably one of the best bench players in the league, but there's no reason why we should be limiting him to that role - he would start on most of the playoff teams in this league so why not let him do the same for us.
[…] week’s In the NO features Ryan and Michael discussing how good Davis really is and if some players have mentally checked […]Accomplished to blow your ever-loving mind.
The two electronic musicians launched Techne, a musical education project, in 2010. They’ve since been touring the country putting on concerts as companion pieces to three-hour workshops designed to teach young girls the art of electronica. Charlottesville will get its chance to give Thorpe and Jones a listen on July 11 and 12.
To prepare yourself for Friday’s concert at The Bridge PAI, clear your mind of any notions you may have about “electronic music.” This is completely different. While Thorpe plays something somewhat close to an instrument you might understand, the electroacoustic flute, Jones produces music through “circuit bending.” To put it in (somewhat) plain terms, she opens the back of digital delay pedals, which common bands use to make riff loops, and produces experimental sounds by manipulating the exposed circuit boards.
Thorpe and Jones don’t end the experimentation there. Not only does Jones make joyful noises using something that looks like it just came out of a busted smartphone, Thorpe jams with her.
“It is improvised, so we don’t know what will happen,” Thorpe said. “We have certain techniques that tend to be fairly consistent, and we are familiar with each other, but every space we perform in is different. We don’t know acoustically how that space will respond.”
Oh, so it’s like jazz, you might think. Don’t go there.
“It is problematic to use the term jazz. That is a loaded term with a lot of history,” Thorpe said. “The term creative improvisation is better applied.”
Fans of more mainstream electronica, not to mention music in general, won’t be completely left out when Techne takes the stage at the Bridge. Thorpe said she and Jones employ a lot of the same tools used by electro-poppers and their ilk, as well as “a shared approach to creativity.” Plus, UVA grad and classically trained guitarist Monika Khot will open the show with her own brand of electroacoustic songwriting.
The goal of Techne’s workshops, one of which C’ville will get a taste of on July 12, is similar to that of the duo’s music, according to Thorpe and Jones. Where their sonic experimentation seeks to throw off the trappings of what is traditionally thought of as music, the seminars are geared toward young girls because electronica and technology are male-dominated fields.
“Not only do we need more democracy in the field, we need better representation across the board,” Thorpe said. “I don’t think the white males that have been in charge have been doing such a good job, and we need more voices.”
While the stated goal of the workshops is to teach attendees how to make electronic tunes, Thorpe and Jones said girls can take more away from the proceedings than just the ability to make a noise more shocking than that coming from a novice violin player’s bedroom. They’ll learn the inner-workings of electronic music—circuitry and electric flow, voltage control, transducers—and they’ll be given the opportunity to break through the barriers that keep them from diving into technology and figuring it out themselves in the first place.
“One of our main goals is to introduce young women to technology in a space and place that has positive role modeling and is supportive,” Jones said. “We use electronic music as a vehicle.”
Girls 12 and up that grab one of the 10 available spots at the free seminar will learn how to make a contact microphone (basically a disc attached to a quarter inch cable that you plug into an amp) and build on that device to create a customized electronic instrument using a box and everyday items. At the end of the workshop, the girls get a chance to jam along with Techne using their homemade music-maker.
Thorpe and Jones said participants don’t need any prior knowledge of electronics to learn the types of skills they’ll teach them. All they need is the ability to keep their ears open.
“Listening is fundamental in any engagement,” Thorpe said.
Bridge executive director Matthew Slaats, who taught alongside Thorpe at an arts school in Manhattan, said the art Techne makes is important not only for its musicality but also for its application to engineering fields and other artistic disciplines.
“As an artist myself, I have used sound in a multitude of ways,” Slaats said. “Opening up the way sound and recording are used to create artwork is something I am interested in seeing happen more and more at the Bridge. This is not just concert-based; we’re thinking about how sound is a medium for creativity.”
Only 50 or so people will be able to crowd into the Bridge for the Techne show. If you don’t make the cut, take apart your smartphone.

The coupon is for $2/1 Paper Mate Profile Pens, 2 or 4pk or InkJoy Pens 2pk. The Papermate Profile Pens 2pk are regularly priced at $2.39! Note, reports are out that the coupon beeps even though it is a perfect match so if you tend to have problems at your stores, I am giving you a head’s up ahead of time!
At Walgreens:

Thanks Midwest Coupon Clippers and Hip2Save for the p!
Works on elite. Same deal I paid .29$ out of pocket! Walgreens is the most difficult store for coupons!
Thanks Coleen! Did the coupon beep on those pens as well?
No the manager tried the elite ones and they went thru finr
Wow! That’s crazy!
Just got back; coupon does not match the inexpensive, regular Profile ones as you have shown, only the elite and inkjoy ones. It beeped and would not go through.
The coupon specifically says Profile Pens on it. I believe that if you stood your ground that they would honor it.
I tried this deal at two of my local walgreens. In my area, the paper mate profile pens are regularly priced at $1.89.
One of the stores accepted the deal while the other did not (Even though ALL of the employees agreed the item matched the coupon).
The first store did not even bother ringing them up and just gave throw them in my bag for free while the second refused to allow the transaction to even take place. They said even though the coupon matches the product exactly, they can not mark an item up or mark the coupon down when it is a walgreens coupon.
I am not sure how far I can push this. I am thrilled I was able to get four packs from my first store free, but I feel guilty that I did not pay the sales tax. I do not want the stores to think I am a bad couponer. However, this coupon should entitle customers to a freebie. So I am torn.
It really depends on how far/hard you want to fight it. Here is the policy that says that they will reduce the coupon down to the selling price of the item. You may also want to contact corporate and get their take on this because I don’t think that they would have released a coupon that they didn’t intend for their stores to honor. It would be great to have something in writing from them if you decide to fight it.Talk:The Guardian
From Uncyclopedia, the content-free encyclopedia
edit To whoever wrote this article
You should be ashamed of yourself for slandering and besmirching the name and reputation of this most glorious of newspapers. Although some of your comments may be fair- ie. the stuff about Guardian readers being the guilt-ridden bourgeoisie- some others are disgusting and caused me to vomit copiously. There is no better national English newspaper than the Guardian. This has been, is now, and will always be the case. Please save your efforts for something more deserving. ie. the Daily Mail.
- Eh, it's not thaaaat bad, but the basic thrust, ie. The Guardian is for knee-jerk leftists who aren't half as well informed as they believe they are, was done to death some time in the early 1920s, and has since stopped being funny.
- I assume by Mail you mean Mirror. Goebbels would be proud of that arse wipe newspaper.
Also it should probably be noted that a fairly large % of the writters of this article are more than likely guardian readers themselves......--The Right Honourable Maj Sir Elvis UmP KUN FIC MDA VFH Bur. CM and bars UGM F@H (Petition) 13:17, 24 December 2006 (UTC)
- I think the first post above misses the point: The Guardian is, in its own way, frequently as ridiculous as the Daily Mail. Both are politically predictable, both are read by members of the middle class who are largely cut-off from what most of the country is actually like but think they know how to run the whole world, both promote a rather simple worldview that says a small clique ("Rightwing Americans" for the Graun, "The Liberal Elite" and the EU for the Mail) are responsible for everything that goes wrong in the world, and both are officially "moderate" in their politics ("Liberal" and "Conservative" respectively) but have in-house writers (and certainly readers, judging by their websites) who are rather more extreme. I think the Guardian's the better paper because it's far more intelligent, I personally tend to agree with it more (although that's more my politics than anything else) and it's "official" editorial stance is rather more balanced than the Mail's. But it's still, in many ways, a paper as ripe for satirical takedown as the Mail. --Zarbag 16:00, July 20, 2010 (UTC)
edit Pinched joke
The thing about Sun readers wanting to rule the world etc is a straight steal off Yes, Prime Minister -- I don't want to remove it cos it's moderately amusing and without it the opener would be boring, but replacing it with something actually original would be good.
- Congrats your the first person to notice where it was ripped from in almost a year and a half, I think there is nowt wrong from stealing this little bit from YM/TPM given that most readers are unlikely to have seen it--The Right Honourable Maj Sir Elvis UmP KUN FIC MDA VFH Bur. CM and bars UGM F@H (Petition) 13:15, 24 December 2006 (UTC)
Well the history of The Guardian is a variant on the Wikipedia article on The Sun. When whoever wrote much of the original finds this, he will doubtless both laugh and cry ;). Seriously, as the demographics are increasingly the main thing separating newspapers rather than content or treatment we should develop this. Mark Lawson as the cultural commentator for The Sun and the Five television channel perhaps. Finger 19:11, 13 June 2007 (UTC)
edit Improvements?
This article is starting to take shape but there are still, I think, some problems:
- The "communism" thing - I have the same problem with this as I have with stuff about Mail readers striding around in jackboots doing stiff-armed salutes all day, namely that it's misdirected satire. The average Graun reader in the popular imagination is more of a sandle-wearing,middle-class or upper-middle-class middlebrow who, like Mail readers, gets all "his" opinions from his favourite paper and its columnists. He's probably a "champagne socialist" who's vaguely supportive of the far-left but wouldn't want to mix with them socially. He's also obsessed with the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and can divert any kind of conversation towards it (this last one seems to be largely true, judging by the CiF messageboards).
- The "History" section needs a complete rewrite. I think a nice angle would be the fact that the Graun used to be a Manchester-based socialist newspaper and has become a very middle-class, very very London-centric "liberal" (in the American sense) newspaper. Perhaps show this happening slowly over time as the flat-cap "provincial" socialists are pushed aside by the metropolitan types.
- Some bits of it are still very weak and a bit lazy - like the "past editors" bit.
- It needs more stuff about the Graun's various sections. I've already done a wee section on the various cartoons found in the paper.
--Zarbag 14:27, May 21, 2011 (UTC)
- Will consider a rewrite on the History Section as it doesn't fit with the rest of the article. --
RomArtus*Imperator ® (Orate) 01:46, January 21, 2012 (UTC)
- Rewrite done. Still left a lot of the original paragraphs there but still needs more polish. --

Technical Abstract:
Male-sterile sorghum carrying the IS1112C cytoplasm represents an unusual example of aberrant microgametogenesis wherein microspores develop into inviable pollen that remain physically intact until anther exsertion. These inviable pollen are characterized by absence of starch deposition, yet fluoresce with the vital stain fluoroscein diacetate. cDNA-AFLP transcript profiling was utilized to examine differential gene expression in near-isogenic male-fertile and male-sterile plants at a late stage representing young-nearly mature pollen, spanning the terminal 96 hrs of pollen development, and an early stage representing early-mid microspores to early pollen, 7-11 days prior to anthesis. The transition from early to late stages is characterized by changes in abundance of nearly 33% of shared transcripts, and early- or late-specific expression of about 10% of transcripts. Male-sterile plants exhibit extensive changes in regulatory patterns characteristic of fertile plants, including premature expression of late-specific, and prolonged expression of early-specific, transcripts. Many late-specific transcripts in male-fertile plants are not expressed in male-sterile plants, which also express transcripts not detected in fertile plants. Genome-wide transcriptome patterns indicate the expression of an estimated 12,000 genes in early-mid microspores. The abundance of at least 15% of these transcripts is altered in male-sterile plants. A near-isogenic line restored to male fertility is characterized by apparent normalized expression of most of these transcripts. The development of the microgametophyte is thus characterized by dynamic programmed changes in gene expression, and the expression of male sterility compounds these changes in a complex manner.Otmane El Rhazi

The Daily Republic does not necessarily condone the comments here, nor does it review every post. Please read our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy before commenting.I guess the thing about my inner dialogue is I feel I’m the same person I was at five years old. Before then, I have a few memories that are more like snapshots, moments of happiness or fear. At five, I was talking to myself in the same tone of voice I have now, confirming what I like, urging myself to try something out, emphasizing when I should remember something. My conscious awareness has grown in understanding, my vocabulary has expanded, but my inner voice sounds the same.
Except that I think now that maybe there are two inner voices. If I really listen, my actual five year old voice is much fainter, much more raw than my daily inner voice. Isn’t that interesting? When I focus, yes, there are two. The supervising voice, the one that says when it’s time for bed or time to go to work, that grown up voice is more “front of house”, distracting me from the other, which doesn’t have the vocabulary. In fact, I think that other voice may not have words. An impulse, a feeling.
I go back to that time I was walking to school with the next door neighbour and I convinced her that we should speak French on the way so that no one would be able to comprehend our conversation. I didn’t know anyone who spoke French nor, I think, did she. My grandparents spoke Ukrainian and my chum was from a Polish background so those languages didn’t qualify.
I clearly remember speaking gibberish with her, gesticulating and modulating the tone of my voice, confident she understood whatever I was pointing out. For a short while I felt immune to outsiders and yes, superior. I don’t know how I learned that French exists. Perhaps it was one of the things that made school exciting. I clearly didn’t understand what language was. French sounded more foreign, more exciting than Ukrainian to my uncomprehending ears. For those moments walking to school, I really believed that if a French person walked by they would understand me. I really believed that by making appropriate sounds my words were transformed into invisible ink, secret and comprehensible only to the initiated.
At five years old, then, I already had a secret life that I wanted to protect from some and share with others. Much later, when I learned what speaking and understanding a language meant, I would squirm when I remembered this walk to school. How embarrassing if a French-speaker really had walked by. How ridiculous a thing to do, in public, no less.
But that memory remains vivid and my inner, inner voice reminds me that 50 years later, I still have a secret life I want to protect from some and share with others.

The Unexpected Tools You Need to Make the Perfect Cake
The first step to creating a beautifully decorated cake is having the right tools. Just like a painter or carpenter needs certain fundamental tools to get started, a cake decorator is often lost without them.
The first step to creating a beautifully decorated cake is having the right tools. Just like a painter or carpenter needs certain fundamental tools to get started, a cake decorator is often lost without them.
To decorate like the pros, it often involves searching beyond the decorating aisle at Michael's. Here, the cake decorators at Teaspoon Bake Shop give you a look at what's inside their bags – and why you should make these tools a part of your baking arsenal if you want to make the perfect cake.
Some of these instruments we are about to recommend are things you would expect to find in a kitchen, but others are more surprising. All of them will make a big difference when you're attempting to wow friends and family with your edible masterpieces – so don’t scoff at the less expected devices!
Here's a look at the unconventional tools that will help with buttercream and fondant decorating:
The serious decorator will need a box that's large enough to hold all her tools, some of them being rather large, like our first recommended tool, a PVC pipe. While most decorating aficionados know that PVC piping is a helpful way to build 3D cake sculptures, we also love to use the strong sturdy pipe to roll out fondant and lift it over the cakes we cover.
Another unusual instrument in our tool box is a large spackling knife. This common fixture in any painter’s arsenal can be found at any hardware store and should measure at least 4 or 5”. While many decorators use spatulas and bench scrapers to ice their cakes to a perfect buttercream finish, spackle knives can cover more surface area and the contoured handles make them easy to hold and maneuver. Just make sure you keep your spackling knife reserved for baking!
For multi-tiered cakes, dowels are crucial to support the stacked structure of the cake. Everyone has their own method for cutting dowels (some cut before putting them in the cake, some do so after). Whenever you do cut them, we recommend using heavy duty gardening shears. Shears will cut through wood or plastic and give a nice, clean cut.
Small figures with tiny features and cupcakes with carefully placed dragees require steady hands and precision. The use of eyebrow tweezers is especially helpful for small tasks where clumsy fingers fail.
Here's a list of more common (but no less essential!) tools that we always keep in our decorating tool kit:
Set of decorating pastry bag tips
Piping bags
Knives
Level
Ruler
Cutters (numbers, alphabet, circles and flowers are musts!)
Pastry wheel
Extruder
Dowels
Fondant smothers
Measuring tape
Xacto knife
Impression mats
Edible markers
Pins
Small rolling pin
Cross off all of the tools in this more traditional checklist, as well as those in the less expected list, and you’ve got yourself a pro decorating kit to create a masterpiece cake out with!

Parental Courage: How Being With My Kids Has Given Me Courage
Being a parent has given me superpowers. I noticed early on in Addie’s life that having her around me changed everything about me in ways I never thought were possible. Kids, they have a tendency to do that to people.
I’m an introvert through and through. I hate the thought of gathering together with a group of people I don’t know and participating in some kind of group discussion. I hate the thought of walking into a room and being paired off with someone who I’ve never met before. I am also terrified of going into a social situation where people who I’ve never met before are gathered to have some kind of social gathering as entertainment. That part doesn’t come fully from the introvert in me, a good chunk of that fear comes from the social idiot that lives inside me.
All of those fears that I just wrote about disappear when I have my kids around me. Give me Vivi’s hand as I walk into a social situation and all my fear is gone. Have Addie by my side as I walk into a group of people for a group discussion and I’ll be fine. These kids, they give me superpowers.
I noticed when Addie was just a couple weeks old and we were at the grocery store that there was something special about her that allowed me to do things I didn’t think I could. As I pushed Addie in the grocery cart I could play little games with her like peek-a-boo and not care that people were watching what I was doing.
The same thing has happened with Vivi. I can put Vivi in the grocery cart and as I follow Casey around the grocery store I lose myself in my surroundings as I talk and play games with Vivi.

mirror exactly as described
Used this seller a few times, will continue to do so. Quick delivery
Great product, good price, swift delivery - perfect!
This was a gift so I don't know how easy it is to use. As the giver I was very disappointed in the size of the mirror which was only about 10cms across. Very small for the price.
the image that the mirror reflects is upside down so could not be used for the purpose that i purchased it for,which is for my sister who is losing her sight.
I find that the light is no help, if fact it is better to use the mirror without the light.
This was my first order and I was pleased it went so smoomthly, I received my item promptly, and the free post and packaging has encouraged me to revisit and place further orders.
very disappointed in product not easy to use
see point 1
Marvellous magnification but would be better free standing as the first one I had fell off the wall and broke!
Fabulous mirror -with eyesight not too good these days (age!) I needed 15x to tackle all those hard to see stray hairs. This fits the bill and is small enough to take on holiday. Was dubious about spending this amount as had seen cheaper makes, but this is a superior product and worth the money- especially with the light, which makes everything crystal clear when natural light not available.
Excellent
5*
Very good product
Came Quick,well packed,
Great mirror. Excellent light. Perfect for tweezing
Excellent mirror, takes a little time to get used to the strong magnification.
Looks just what was wanted, but will be given as a present

Jelly bean nail art is sweet and simple, especially for springtime and Easter. To give this nail look a try, you will need a base and top coat, white nail polish and 5 nail polishes in various jelly bean colors. Additionally, you will also need a dotting tool to create little jelly bean shapes.
- Start off by applying your clear base coat and allow it to dry completely. Next, polish all of your nails in one or two coats of white nail polish.
- Once the white polish dries completely, use your dotting tool and the first jelly bean color of your choice to create a jelly bean shape on a random location of each fingernail.
- Repeat this process with the four remaining nail polish colors. You can also fill in any empty spaces with additional jelly bean designs.
- After you use all 5 of your nail polish colors, apply a small bit of white nail polish to your dotting tool and create one very small streak towards a corner of each jelly bean. These streaks will represent reflections and add realistic interest to your designs.Searching for

(WTVR)–Authorities say a bear cub was last seen running towards the Swift Creek Reservoir.CHESTERFIELD, Va. (WTVR)–Authorities say a bear cub was last seen running towards the Swift Creek Reservoir.
Without a confirmed capture and no other sightings since Thursday afternoon around three, some living in Woodlake are taking precautions. Even the normal nuisances nature provides can cause alarm when a bear is reported to be around.
“It’s just a bug,” said Kathy Smith, sounding relieved.
And that’s far better than a bear. Smith says her kids will be under tight supervision the next few days, waiting for word on where the black bear cub may be.
“I have little kids and to think a bear could come by makes me nervous,” said Smith.
Smith’s backyard bumps up against Ken Tiller’s.
“I’m a little bit leery,” said Tiller. “I’m also a little bit in awe. I’ve never seen one in 25 years here.”
Tiller lives in the Candlewick community in Woodlake. Police sources tell CBS 6 that’s where the cub was seen making a run for it earlier, before darting into Beechwood Point.
Tiller believes there’s evidence in his yard. “The last couple of days there’s been large prints, paw prints,” he said. “And at first I thought maybe it was a gopher or raccoon, but it’s too big for that.”
What worries Woodlake residents is the presence of a bear cub may mean momma bear isn’t too far behind. Game and Inland Fisheries officials say keep your distance and call in all sightings.
Also, they add it’s a good idea to keep your small pets and anything that can be food inside.
“We usually eat out on the deck,” said Smith. “So we got to make sure there’s no food out there and kids will stay inside until they figure this out.”
Wildlife officials are urging folks not to approach the bear or do anything to make the bear feel as if it has to defend itself.So, you guys know that NSFW flash I mentioned I needed voice actors for? Well, everything's pretty much recorded and the sketchimation is coming along nicely, but there is another problem.
See, I want this to be a really nice project in the end. Like, for realsies. But, I'm limited in my knowledge of Flash (I'm using CS3, by the way). I don't know how to do any of the ActionScript stuff, and as much as I try to follow tutorials and all that, I can't seem to get it down. *shrug* can't do it all, I guess.
So! I was hoping maybe someone out there would be willing and able to help me with the programming for this. I would like the flash to have a loading screen and a menu that includes buttons to play the main animation, a subtitled version of the main animation, the sketchimation, the credits, and the bloopers. If anyone knows how to go about doing that, I would REALLY appreciate their help. Anyone involved with the project will be credited for their work (unless they want to remain anonymous, which is understandable given the content).…ade....

Let's make that clear up front. The programming on C-Spans 1 and 2 is testament to that. But just like some off-Broadway shows are worth the trip downtown, so too does small-time politics have its charms.
It's the beauty of democracy, really: Every day, puffed-up, self-important citizens are invited to participate in local government, and every day, these mentally imbalanced people accept the challenge. Whether playing the role of maniacal elected official or just answering the call of duty as an unreasonably concerned citizen, there is a place where you can leave your unique footprint in the annals of "things that won't make much of a difference in the long run anyway."
But if it's simply entertainment you're after, you could do a lot worse than kicking back with a bucket of popcorn at your next city council meeting. With any luck, someone there will be as certifiable as the folks below.
Racist School Board Meeting
Wow, that was a quick fall from grace. One minute the guy's being applauded, the next he's unleashing a stream of racist slurs from here to China (literally). From the context of the video you can't quite pin down exactly what it is he's angry about, but if I had to guess I would say it has something to do about the food in the cafeteria. Apparently, the tandoori chicken served during "Indian Food Day" didn't go over well with this man.
Steve Rocco on Drug Reform
Proof that even in real life the O.C. is a black hole of competency: In 2004, two people ran for the elected office of trustee of the Orange Unified School District Board -- and this guy won. (Presumably, the other guy was either a vampire or, worse, a fiscal liberal.) Somehow, my never having heard about this guy's "death attempts" by the son of Albertson's CEO ("he's dead") is a result of "the drug situation trying to protect their...whatever." Well played, Orange County citizens!
City Council Attack
There's more overacting in this video than in a Spanish soap opera -- from the bloodcurdling screams to the tumble to the floor to the judge's order to "stop that woman from leaving the courtroom!" to the random woman at the bottom of the screen shaking her head for an entire twenty seconds in either extreme disapproval or approval with extreme attitude. How can they get any work done with all this awesome action going on?!
Detroit Shouting Match
If you like your city council meetings tense and rife with the constant threat of physical violence, then Detroit is for you! Featuring verbal gems like "You're not my Daddy!" and "Be respectful -- you may not do that at home, but you're gonna do that up in hea" (along with several not-at-all-veiled references to the giant cartoon monster Shrek), this meeting is like one of those movie scenes that escalates from a simple misunderstanding into an all-out bar fight with random cowboys throwing each other over tables.
Crazy Man at City Council Meeting
Any video that starts off with a rogue helicopter pilot gets my seal of approval. Here are some things we learn: There's no ice in the arena because someone had their hand in the pie, boy scouts get scared easily, this guy may be harboring a "wife" in his basement against her will, the helicopter was right near the magnolia tree, "lemon-headed" is a surprisingly effective curse word when shouted with irrational rage, and you can say the word "pussy" in a North Carolina City Council meeting and they will still politely thank you for coming.What does it mean for an action or gesture to be site-specific? Reflecting on her time at Headlands, Flora Wiegmann (AIR '09) will consider this question through performance and discussion. The notion of site-specificity runs deep in her work– both its potential and its impossibility. These conflicting ideas are illustrated through her experimentation with the fleeting activities of choreography and dance, on the one hand, and the permanence of video and filmmaking, on the other. This rare, first-hand experience will begin to illuminate Wiegmann’s immersive practice as a performer and image-maker. We ask that you kindly RSVP to public programs by emailing info@headlands.org.

You can call him six-time, I call him “Big Money,” because when it’s all on the line, the 48 team gets it done. That they did as Johnson wins his 67th Sprint Cup victory. His streak of winning at least one race in every season he’s raced full-time (since 2002) remains intact.
Those who have a hard time accepting the dominance, have all kinds of reasoning, from a cheating crew chief, a palm greasing owner, a complicit governing body, and other similar explanations. It’s not hard to understand, Chad Knaus has been caught in the act. Owner Rick Hendrick’s reputation was soiled when he crossed the Internal Revenue Service. Perpetual tweaking with the rules and the perception that NASCAR looks the other way when a violation occurs has not helped its own reputation in a time where its credibility has taken a hit with the fans.
Maybe there’s a simpler reason, the same reason other “hated” teams- the Miami Heat, the New York Yankees and the New England Patriots dominate: for them, winning is obsessive. Johnson, Knaus and all involved overturn every rock when it comes to finding a way. At the post-race news conference, Knaus thanked the 5 team of Kasey Kahne and Kenny Francis for notes that he says helped the 48 with their set-up. Of course, fans know Kahne has been no stranger to success at Charlotte. Johnson’s crew chief joked about “stealing” the notes. That’s just being resourceful, and you can be sure Francis was more than happy to share.
It’s more than just money; three other NASCAR Sprint Cup teams also belong to Hendrick. As far as that goes, how many times do you see a more talented driver take over a ride that has struggled and suddenly with that new driver, they find success. The classic example is when Kyle Busch took over the 18 at Joe Gibbs Racing. They went from being an o.k. team under J.J. Yeley to a car that was at times, dominant in 2008. Look what Kurt Busch did in his short stint at Furniture Row, a lesser funded team. All this to say that Jimmie Johnson has to have talent to win races and championships year after year.
This is not to discount the part Rick Hendrick and his resources play in all this. A hand on, engaged owner, who is willing to put the right pieces in place and let his people do what they do well is sports ownership genius. Patriots owner Bob Craft gets it, Seahawks owner Paul Allen understands it, and Cowboy fans hope Jerry Jones gets it someday. It’s hard to make chicken salad out of chicken droppings. Hendrick makes his organization’s lot in life much either.
As the father of a pre-teen son who competes in youth sports, I see it all the time: parents and coaches look for that secret ingredient to success. They look for that one thing. Talent is at the base of it all, you can’t win without it, but talent isn’t enough. Money helps tremendously, but at least in the context of motorsports, all the money in the world can’t make a marginally talented driver great. You can work like a dog to make it all happen, but look how many very talented drivers struggle with rides that just can’t run with the best.
It takes it all: talent, hard work and a commitment of resources. You can get by without the money if there’s an extra commitment of time or ingenuity. In Johnson’s case, however, he’s got it all. He may not win the Cup this year, but he has served notice he’s in the running, and he will push the field. The top teams know it, winning is no accident with six-time champion Jimmie Johnson.The recently released development draft for SHared Access Research Ecosystem (SHARE), authored by the Association of American Universities (AAU), the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities (APLU) and the Association of Research Libraries (ARL) in response to the OSTP memo […] ↓ Read the rest of this entry…

Help me! ebay CD auction.
I'm selling 3 AIO's on ebay for 6 bucks. THis morning I got an email telling me 2 of the diapers look like pockets, am I sure? I want to block her from bidding. I know they are AIO's. Pockets are pretty easy to tell apart. :banghead: I'm risking my 100% feedback over her. I've sold diapers before with no issue!:banghead: :banghead:

Re: Help me! ebay CD auction.
I am sure you can block somebody if you don't want to sell to her. And I wonder how she is so sure that you are misrepresenting your dipes? That would irk me. Don't worry about it, some people just like to causes trouble or perhaps she is a newbie and just really doesn't know what she is talking about. :giggle:

Re: Help me! ebay CD auction.
I don't want to be the odd one out but here is my take..
I have been REALLY RIPPED OFF on ebay SEVERAL times (I now longer buy on there unless it is from 4 sellers I trust)
I have actually bought diapers that were listed as AIO's and then they were fitteds..Have bought AIO's that ended up being pockets and have bought diapers that were listed as EUC and then were anything but that :banghead: (I wouldn't even think about re-selling!)
Is she asking about them in a mean way are maybe from the perspective of a woman that has been ripped off before?
Perhaps she is new to CD'ing OR perhaps she thinks you are new and may not actually know what you have?? Maybe she thought she was being helpful??
Anyway, I don't see how if what you are selling is AIO's and she bids and gets AIO's she could leave bad feedback? I would Just let her know how long you have CD and that you are sure these are AIO's and not pockets :goodvibes:

Re: Help me! ebay CD auction.
She could easily get them and say she is dissatisfied. I don't refund on ebay anymore, unless I misrepresent the item. And she could easily get them and say they aren't AIO's. I have no way, except for my pictures, to prove myself. If she decides they are pocketshe could want her money back. I won't refund it. She could leave me a negitive. She could go to paypal and file a complaint. I'd be out everything, plus have a negitive. I refuse to risk it. Buyers aren't always honest either.
And I know what I have. They are AIO's. I bought them as AIO's.

Re: Help me! ebay CD auction.
no i guess buyers probably aren't always honest but...
you could take pictures of the insides and all the seams so it would be clear for "your proof"
but what about her feedback? if its good i'd give her the benefit of the doubt :)
well honestly i probably would either way but....

Re: Help me! ebay CD auction.
I already blocked her. In general I am distrusting of people. (For some reason I come across as rude, and people in general just take me as a cold person.) I'd rather not risk anything. Anymore I'd rather sell here.

Neodigital – art for the 21st century
I’ve been promoting Neodigital Art for a few years now. If you search for the word Neodigital with Google, you should find all my stuff! Neodigital Art is art for the 21st century and I want it to be as inclusive as possible. Not just for the rich with their galleries and open cheque books.
Wednesbury
I have used Photoscape, a freeware editing program to edit this photo.
The lake where I took the the photo is on the South side of Wednesbury (the town I live in) and this was my first edit, in colour. Notice that the first picture isn’t colour, it’s monochrome! This was the original picture:
It’s dull and dark, but a nice picture. This isn’t about capturing what was there, there wasn’t enough light for that. It is the end of Autumn. It is about creating art, something unique that no one else can create. I started by compensating for the light and making the picture lighter and adding contrast.
It looks better doesn’t it? It also looks more like what I saw, looking through the viewfinder. One of the reasons it looks so dark in the previous picture is I had a narrow aperture, for depth of field; but that allows less light into the camera. Now I have a lighter picture and depth of field. My next step was to crop the ducks off at the bottom of the picture.
Then I got creative! I used Photoscape to put a lens flare into the picture. That created an illusion, because the sun was actually behind me. My final trick was to choose a colour and make the whole picture monochrome.
Do you think a large framed print of the picture belongs in Wednesbury art gallery or should we stick with paintings from little known artists from previous eras? I think it’s highly unlikely that local talent will ever be recognised in the Black Country, let alone Wednesbury, but we can keep trying until people wake up. Most people in Wednesbury have never even stood and looked at that lake when the sun shines. They haven’t seen the bluebells of Spring or the golden leaves of Autumn. How can they judge or appreciate beauty, when all they see is a TV screen? My picture is unique, I think it is art and it is creative photography.

Smilla Toothies are tooth-shaped snacks that can help with dental care for cats.
I'm always looking for different snack and treats for my cats to keep their life interesting.
Each kibble piece of these Smilla Dental Care Snack Toothies is quite big for a cat treat, we are used to much smaller ones, but I can see that this means the cat has no choice but to chew them rather than just swallow which some cats can have a habit of doing. Each piece is also shaped like a little tooth.
One of the best things is about this treat is that they come in a solid plastic tub rather than a soft package so they stay really nice and fresh between openings and If you have a cat that likes to get into things like treats it's a bit harder for them to tear the package open.
These treats have been popular with our cats. They're not as popular as things like Dreamies but they'll happily eat them.
The ingredients are Poultry meal, rice, barley, animal fats, liver meal, greaves meal, hydrolysed protein, cellulose (dried), fish meal, powdered egg, linseed, fish oils, yeast (dried), sodium phosphate, potassium chloride, dried lingonberries, dried blueberries, mussel meal, chicory (dried), marigold flowers (dried), yucca (dried).
They contain vitamin A (24,750 IU/kg), vitamin D3 (1,500 IU/kg), vitamin E (590mg/kg), copper as copper-(II) sulphate, pentahydrat (10mg/kg), taurine (1,950mg/kg).
The treats have a greasy feel which is a bit unusual as most treats like this are dry and they do make your fingers greasy.
They cost about £1.49 for a 125g pack and they seem good value as there is plenty in a pack.

In case you missed it Monday, President Obama laid out an ambitious agenda as he began his second term and delivered his second inaugural address. Besides mentioning these turning points in the nation's march to equality, he also carried the torch for a strong response to climate change. The President did not mince words:
We will respond to the threat of climate change, knowing that the failure to do so would betray our children and future generations. Some may still deny the overwhelming judgment of science, but none can avoid the devastating impact of raging fires and crippling drought and more powerful storms.
Critics will immediately and correctly point out that there is no evidence that climate change caused a specific wildfire or hurricane. (We are not so sure droughts cannot be attributed.)
But the critics don’t get a free pass either. This is from the editorial page of Monday’s on-line Wall Street Journal:.
By our dictionary, a “modern liberal catechism” would entail a set of questions and answers; hence, referring to commandments seems to be mixing Mosaic and Jesuitical metaphors. And castigating Mr. Obama for stigmatizing his opposition, is "the pot calling the kettle black" when the editorial spits out “liberal” as if it is a synonym for “demonic.”
But we try to avoid getting embroiled in the politics of climate change and seek to stay focused on the facts. Here is the catechism we use in assessing climate change: How do we know climate change exists? Follow the money.
We gave a talk last week, Climate Change: Uncovering Risks in a Warming World. To introduce the subject and demonstrate it is real, and that it is now, we gave two examples. As reported in the Wall Street Journal, last November a Russian LNG tanker made the trip from Norway to Japan for the first time using the Northern Sea Route, that is, across the Arctic Ocean north of Russia. An LNG tanker costs in the vicinity of $200 million, which apparently the ship’s owner and its insurers felt safe in risking. They are not alone, traffic along the Northern Sea Route has risen steadily in the past few years. Why? Money. The estimated savings in sailing the much shorter route could be $3 million. The other example concerned winegrowing. Denmark, to our amazement, makes a world-class sparkling wine. How can this be? Wine-growing regions are migrating. According to a study by the National Academy of Sciences, current winegrowing regions will shrink by 80% by 2100; the UN estimates viticulture will migrate north by over 100 miles as certain areas become too hot and too dry. So what are viticulturists doing? They are buying properties further north, on north-facing slopes and at higher altitudes. Again, people are making investment decisions based on the changing climate. Is climate change real? Follow the money.
Which takes us back to the contents of the second inaugural address, or, rather, what was not in the contents. There was no thoughtful alliteration of turning points in the nation’s march to mitigating and adapting to climate change for the simple reason that Copenhagen, Cancun and Qatar haven’t turned us at all. If the President is going to deliver on his promise, he is going to have to change that.

Climate Change Blog.Roger Goodell and the NFL have another concussion lawsuit to deal with. This time it comes courtesy of former Lions and Cal running back Jahvid Best.
Concussions forced the once-promising Best, a 2010 first-round pick by the Lions, to retire from the NFL last year, and on Tuesday he took legal action against the NFL, as well as helmet manufacturer Riddell, because of them. From the Detroit Free Press:.
A Lions spokesperson did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
According to the Free Press, the amount of damages Best is seeking is still uncertain at this point. Best’s lawyer said it’s “premature” to come up with an exact figure right now because the long-term effects of Best’s multiple concussions are still to be determined.
Best reportedly suffered five (FIVE!) total concussions during his pro and college career—three with the Lions and two while at Cal, including one from this terrifying fall that knocked him out cold in 2009:
Best reportedly will be part of Cal’s coaching staff this upcoming season.On 03/29, anfei wrote:>> On Sun, Mar 28, 2010 at 06:28:21PM +0200, Oleg Nesterov wrote:> > On 03/28, anfei wrote:> > >> > >.> >> > I see.

It also is striking in the way that it uses dialogue and silence to create the relationship between the man and the girl, rather than description.

Does
George Osborne have any comprehension about, what the word SIMPLIFICATION, really means!
it's a bad joke
Before Osborne who was the last Chancellor who came to office with a massive fanfare about tax simplification?
Step forward Gordy Brown - who went on to treble or quadruple the UK tax code depending on which measure you use.
Osborne is on track to match this even if the rest of his budget was a total mess!
50% rate HOW CAN THEY POSSIBLY KNOW
.....how much income was accelerated into 09-10 ? Agree the argument was rubbish.
Worse still they are also
depending on those 'honest' 1% of the highest paid to stop avoiding tax as a result of the lower tax rate.
Even my lowly basic rate taxpaying clients don't want to pay more tax if they can help it....so what hope those who spend £1,000s on tax specialists to reduce their tax....
Lower tax rates don't end tax avoidance
I've seen enough clients willing to undertake schemes to avoid 10% CGT to know that there is no positive rate of tax that people won't seek to avoid.
It amuses me that a 50% rate is spoken of by some as though it were apocalyptically high when 60% was the top rate for many years only a generation ago. And that was a welcome reduction from the still higher rates that prevailed not long before that!
Mendacious is a precisely chosen word by Simon to describe some of these arguments.
Taxation rates and evasion
I've seen enough clients willing to undertake schemes to avoid 10% CGT to know that there is no positive rate of tax that people won't seek to avoid.
Firsly, let us all remember that avoidance is perfectly legal and legitimate, so we are really talking about evasion here.
While this is of course true, one only has to look carefully at those eastern european states who introduced flat rate taxation of around 18% (from marginal rates not too dissimilar to that of the UK) and notice that they are reporting a much improved total tax take as a result. What one can't know is just how widespread wholesale evasion was, prior to the flat rate introduction. What is also clear is that telling people accurately and honestly where their tax money is being spent, also seems to reduce evasion.
No, I'm talking about avoidance
I certainly wasn't suggesting there was any evasion - I was helping those clients with their tax avoidance! My point was that, human nature sadly being what it is (greedy), I don't believe a reduction in tax rates necessarily makes people less inclined to avoid tax if they can. The new, lower rate becomes settled and, before long (or when the tax bill is looming), many will still seek to avoid it. That will be so for a 45% rate and would be at lower rates still.
Arguments for flat rate tax are not entirely dissimilar to flat earth arguments for me - backwards. I believe progressive taxation is just and equitable in a civilised society. I'm sure a low, flat rate does raise the tax take in jurisdictions where tax evasion is widespread and the enforcement of tax collection is lax. That doesn't make it a model for advanced western economies to follow.
I agree wholeheartedly that we in the west are crying out for a mature debate about tax and public spending, neither of which is inherently bad as the frothier commentators on the right would have us believe.

Cance are some phrases you can use to break plans politely:
Be sure to start any statement with an apology like "I'm sorry." Then, a simple way to inform someone you have to cancel is to say, "I have to cancel." Though be aware this phrasing may sound abrupt to a friend or business associate. It's best to use when you're canceling something like a doctor's appointment through a secretary: "I'm sorry, I have to cancel my appointment tomorrow."
"I can't make it" has the same meaning as "I have to cancel," but it's more informal. It's a better choice when you're breaking plans directly with a friend or colleague. For example, if you and a friend had planned to meet for dinner you could say, "I'm sorry, I can't make it tonight." But be prepared with a reason why you can't make it - many people will naturally ask, "Really? Why not?"
If you don't want someone asking "why" you have to cancel, then follow, "I'm sorry, I can't make it" with "Something has come up." This phrase means something has happened to make it impossible for you to be there. Most native English speakers understand when you say this, they shouldn't ask questions about what has "come up."
This is a very conversational way to inform someone you can't be there. Saying "I was really looking forward to our meeting" indicates you took the plans very seriously. No one wants to feel like you didn't care! You can finish the sentence with any of the above statements: "I was really looking forward to seeing you, but something has come up."!

February Focus: African-American Citizenship
February 12, 2009
WASHINGTON (Army News Service, Feb. 3, 2009) -- The national theme of this year's African American History Month observance running through February is "Quest for Black Citizenship in the Americas."
In keeping with this theme, the Equal Employment Opportunity Web site for Department of the Army headquarters features a quiz "Paving the Way to the Presidency."
EEO Officer Beatrice Bernfeld said employees can test their knowledge of African Americans within the electoral system by taking the quiz at <a href=""target=_blank></a>.
In addition to citizenship, the Department of Defense will emphasize quality education during the month-long observance, according to Jay D. Aronowitz, the acting deputy assistant secretary of the Army for EEO and Civil Rights.
In a memorandum to Army commands, Aronowitz said the DOD theme for African American History month supports Presidential Executive Order 13256, aimed at advancing equal opportunity in higher education. The special DOD theme for the month is "Reaching Out to Youth: A Strategy for Excellence."
A DOD outreach event is scheduled to take place Feb. 25-26 at Alabama Agriculture and Mechanical University in Normal, Ala. As part of the ceremonies, DOD will present African-American History Month Recognition Awards to selected service members.
The awards will be presented by the Department of Defense Office of Diversity Management and Equal Opportunity to service members who have supported the Global War on Terrorism between February 2006 and January of this year. Nominees must demonstrate role-model qualities and the core values of their service, according to Aronowitz. His memorandum states per diem and travel costs must be paid by the recipients' units. Award nominations must be submitted through each unit's chain of command and submitted to the Army's G-1 EO office.
The EEO Directorate for Army headquarters is sponsoring a special Pentagon tour Feb. 19 focusing on African-American contributions to the Army, both by civilians and Soldiers. The morning tour will feature the "African Americans in the Defense of Our Nation" Corridor display located in the Pentagon's second floor A-Ring, near corridor 7.
The roots of African American History Month stem back to Harvard-trained historian, Carter G. Woodson. He founded the "Association for the Study of Negro Life and History," which began a week-long observance honoring Black History in February 1926.
By the time of Woodson's death in 1950, the History Week had become a significant observance. Mayors of cities nationwide issued proclamations. The celebration was expanded to a month in 1976, the nation's bicentennial, with a proclamation by President Gerald R. Ford. Since then each American president has issued proclamations for the month-long observance.Rational

Overview
During the final weeks of class, students will work in teams of 3-5 people, helping a campus organization, academic department, or area business write documents. In consultation with the course instructors, each team will solicit a local organization or business for various writing tasks that will serve as the team's final course project. The nature of these projects vary from group to group because the project will be greatly controlled by the client each group chooses, as well as that client's needs.
Projects may include proposals or executive summaries, marketing reports, public relations pieces, policy guidelines, grant proposals, training manuals, brochures, and so forth.
If you would like more information about any of these client projects, or would like to become a client and work with future professional writing students, please email the instructor at:

Portrait retouching can be a complex and time-consuming task, but in this quick Photoshop tutorial you’ll learn how to streamline the process and greatly enhance your results.
Francisco Hernandez is a Texas photographer who doesn’t like spending too much time behind the computer, and in the 10-minute video below he explains the system he uses for editing portrait photographs.
Hernandez relies on three basic Photoshop tools to accomplish the tasks in the video—the Spot Healing Brush, Clone Stamp, and Patch tool. He demonstrates how to remove blemishes, get rid of distractions like unruly stands of hair, and make a few simple exposure adjustments.
You’ll also learn how to even out out skin tones with simple dodging and burning techniques. Check the FJH YouTube channel for more tips from Hernandez, and be sure to look at the Photoshop tutorial we posted yesterday, explaining how to create dramatic backlighting effects.

[Famed EDM DJ Steve Aoki has found himself in some hot water and is facing a lawsuit from a young girl who broke her neck at one of his shows. The girl, Brittany Hickman, attended one of Aoki's shows in San Diego a few years ago where Aoki did his usual routine of jumping off of the stage onto a life raft in the crowd. During this particular show, Hickman found herself underneath the life raft in the crowd and was violently struck when Aoki jumped onto the raft from the elevated stage. Footage of the incident, which resulted in an injured ankle and broken neck for Hickman, can be seen below via surveillance cameras at the hotel where the concert took place.

2 regular shaped heart cakes (8), cooled and filled.
Then carve to look more anatomical; ice with Buttercream.
For the valves, I cut out holes in the cake, ice the holes then airbrush black on that BC.
I then covered the cake with fondant, and then I rolled fondant valves and put them into the holes, and smoothed them to look like they were all one piece.
I put some smashed paper towels into each valve and let it set until the fondant set up hard.
I rolled out fondant worms to make all the veining in 2 different sizes (arteries/veins) and applied to the heart.
Once the valves set up, I airbrushed the whole heart (I did airbrush the insides of the valves black to give it more depth).
Once the airbrushed dried, I applied confectioner glaze to it all. I colored piping gel dark crimson and dripped it as needed (to make it more realistic)

Interstellar Detectives is a Disney Fan webcomic. It's often mistaken as an Epic Mickey fan webcomic simply because a few characters from the game star in the comic. It made its debut on January 14, 2011 on ComicFury [1]
and still runs. Artwork, Character Designs, and Sketch versions of pages can be seen on the creator's DeviantArt account [2]
The story is about Horace Horsecollar and Oswald the Lucky Rabbit responding to a summons notice that came from a disc, this however results in a confrontation with a space bounty hunter, Clarabelle Cow getting involved and Horace injured. Oswald makes his own discovery that his ex-girlfriend Fanny Cottontail is a intergalactic officer and Horace was a galactic vigilante and detective. This leads Fanny no choice but registering Clarabelle and Oswald as investigators and unlocking Horace's memories of his detective work.The rest of the series revolves around solving cases around the universe, uncovering supernatural secrets, and preventing the hellish downfall of the universe.
This Series Features Examples of:
- Amnesiac Lover: In The Forgotten Memories Of the Lost Hero, Horace temporary loses his memories about Clarabelle. But either way is in love with her.
- Amusing Alien: Lots of them...
- Atonement Detective: Horace
- Astral Projection: Clarabelle is able to in later stories but not just traveling in the world of the dead but able to travel in time without interfering or altering anything.
- Backstory: There's lots of them, mainly meant for explanation.
- Bad Cop/Incompetent Cop: Fanny is obviously one, mainly just not obeying orders and reckless driving.
- BFG: Oswald's guns, one that's the size of those party favor water guns but is powerful like the Noisy Cricket from Men In Black and the other normal sized in the form of a 50's style gun.
- Bounty Hunter
- Clueless Detective: Oswald and Horace
- Divine Comedy: The third story
- Hero-Worshipper: Dalv
- How We Got Here: Abducted and The Forgotten Memories Of the Lost Hero
- Humanoid Aliens
- Inspired By: An unmade series for The Disney Afternoon called Maximum Horsepower (here's
more info on it and other TDA shows that didn't make the cut).
- Laser-Guided Amnesia: Horace in the beginning of the series
- Muppet: Uncle Deadly appears in an upcoming story
- No Doubt The Years Have Changed Me: Fanny is no longer a damsel in distress but a smart alec feminist
- Old Friend, New Gender: Apparently Fanny's hair over the years she was gone had grown to be a curly bob haircut. Oswald admits he couldn't even tell it was her until he heard Fanny's voice
- Plausible Deniability: Fanny reminds Oswald of this when he asks her why she lied to him about living in a temple on Mt. Everest. She even reveals that by neuralyzing Horace of his intergalactic work, they were able to prevent the endangerment of Earth.
- Please Don't Leave Me: Clarabelle in Abducted and part of The Forgotten Memories Of the Lost Hero is hoping Horace wasn't killed by the shot.
- Plucky Comic Relief: Dalv and "Space Madness" Oswald
- Screw the Rules, I'm Doing What's Right: Pretty much the main four in the entire series.
- Space Madness: Oswald develops this in The Forgotten Memories Of the Lost Hero, but is shown to slip in and out of it. Usually as a running gag throughout the rest of the series.
- Taking the Bullet: Horace does in the first story
- This Is Unforgivable!: In The Forgotten Memories Of the Lost Hero Oswald is pretty angry that Fanny had lied to him about living in a temple on Mt.EverestPeople on welfare should pass test too

To The Editor: I have a question for Henderson County and the state of North Carolina as a whole.
A lot of folks in this county have a job. They work, they get paid, they pay taxes, and the government distributes their taxes as it sees fit. In order for them to get paid, a lot are required to pass a urine test, which most don't have a problem with.
What I do have a problem with is the distribution of taxes to people who don't have to pass a urine test to get a welfare check, after most have taken the test to earn it for them!
Please understand, I have nothing against helping people get back on their feet. I do, on the other hand, have a problem with people sitting on their butts.
Could you imagine how much money the county and/or state would save if people had to pass a urine test every month to get a public assistance check?

BUENOS AIRES, ARGENTINA: When it comes to a Davis Cup by BNP Paribas tie being played in Argentina, passion runs high and the three days will have an atmosphere that is almost unequalled anywhere. This weekend in the semifinals at the Parque Roca, Argentina has assembled its best team to take on the finest from the Czech Republic.
The draw for the tie was conducted at a beautiful auditorium in a new concert venue, Uzine del Arte, in Buenos Aires and it highlighted that Juan Martin del Potro, Argentina’s most recent Grand Slam champion, would take on the tenacious play of Radek Stepanek in the opening rubber. That would be followed by US Open semifinalist Tomas Berdych against Juan Monaco.
The doubles rubber on Saturday has Lukas Rosol and Ivo Minar squaring off against Carlos Berlocq and Eduardo Schwank. The doubles teams can be changed up to an hour before play and depending on how the first day goes the gut feeling is that Stepanek and Berdych might just step in.
In the reverse singles the two No.1’s will start play on the final day. Berdych plays del Potro and then Stepanek plays Monaco.
For both nations the Davis Cup has been elusive; the Czech’s have won it just once back in 1980 while under the Czechoslovakian flag, while the Argentines have lost four finals and never won the title. And should the Argentines get through to the final who must wonder if the home team can take encouragement from what Andy Murray just did? The British star lost his first four Grand Slam finals before claiming the US Open, his fifth final.
.
“We expect everything to stay in fair play and the crowd is only going to be loud. Every match in Davis Cup is completely different to all the others. I am expecting a very hard opponent with the home crowd and playing for his home country. I will try my best, I will try to bring something from my form from New York and try to build on that. I am there to bring a point for us and I hope I am successful.”
Berdych added that for him everything is fine even though the schedule is quite packed and quite tough but he’s prepared and ready for the weekend. He said the match court is in a very good condition which makes it easier when transferring from the North American hard courts.
Del Potro has been struggling with a wrist problem and there were concerns about his fitness but he has made it very clear that it was not going to stop him representing his nation.
“I hope my wrist is okay,” he said. “Still I am feeling little pain but I will still try to manage the painful and play my best tennis here is Buenos Aires.”
He has not been in a position to test the wrist out completely. He makes it clear that it is not 100%, but his passion for representing his nation just as he did at the Olympics where he won the bronze medal will not be overcome by anything.
Del Potro added: “I am playing Davis Cup and sometimes you get more energy to play these kinds of matches and the crowd will be fantastic for me and that will help me to fight.’
For the Czech team having someone like Stepanek on their side is such a bonus. His years and years of experience have made him tough both physically and mentally. He could almost be likened to a war horse and a work horse.
“I have had a great year in doubles so far and always when it came to Davis Cup, I won in tournament before, like I won in Australian Open and then in Miami and then we won in Davis Cup,” Stepanek said. “Now, before this tie, I have been in the finals of the US Open, so looking to Davis Cup it is always bringing some magic out of me and I will definitely try to use that confidence from the matches I played there to my advantage in Argentina.”
Monaco meanwhile has been enjoying the best year of his career and, even though he had a disappointing US Open, there is a positive that can be taken away from that as he looks to this semifinal.
“It gave me more time to practice here and be ready for the matches because it will be very difficult to play against all the guys from the Czech Republic,” Monaco said. “I feeling great here, playing at home and on clay and with all the Argentine supporters, so it will be nice to play back here and at home.”
This is going to be a loud, frenetic and very passionate weekend. Tennis will be a winner.

Parque Roca, Buenos Aires, ArgentinaThis October, Batman: Arkham City hits store shelves and digital download services across North America, following soon thereafter in Europe and Australia. It's to be the latest in a long line of Batman-themed videogames that stretches back to classic (and nigh-forgotten) home computers such as the Amstrad CPC/PCW and ZX Spectrum, though it's likely that most gamers' memories of the franchise kick off with the movie-licensed Batman on the NES, from 1989. The game was a difficult and hectic side-scrolling action-platformer that was certainly enjoyable at the time.
The rest of the franchise's history doesn't treat it so well, from the ho-hum Batman: Vengeance to the execrable Batman Forever, based on what was, for years, the last passable Batman movie. That's the thing, isn't it? Even when the movies got a much needed shot in the arm with 2005's Batman Begins, the resulting game was forgettable at best. It wasn't until Batmania hit fever-pitch in the wake of 2008's seminal superhero piece, The Dark Knight, that we saw the release of a similarly transcendent Batman videogame. I speak, of course, of Batman: Arkham Asylum, which launched in August, 2009.
Literally the second game out of Rocksteady Studios (the first was Urban Chaos: Riot Response, and it's not bad if you're curious), Arkham Asylum succeeded not only financially, but critically. In fact, it's the only comic-based videogame I can think of that received Game of the Year accolades from major media outlets. It wasn't just a good superhero game; it was simply an unqualified success.
And that is because it used the fact that it was a Batman game to its advantage. Rather than using an existing videogame framework and attempting to shoehorn Batman into it as previous titles had done, Arkham Asylum was entirely about the experience of being Batman. His combat prowess, his keen intellect and forensic ability, his acrobatics, and his stealthy movement were all blended together in a seamless and enjoyable manner. Amazingly, Rocksteady managed to capture his fragility.
As one of the few normal, human members of the Justice League, Batman has to rely on outsmarting his opponents and avoiding them more often than combating them head-on. Knives are trouble, stun batons are frustrating, and guns are absolutely lethal—they to be taken out of the equation immediately. Building the game around this understanding of Batman's character drew on his appeal and made players feel like they were, if only for a few hours, the Dark Knight himself. The story contributed to this by making his opponents, the named and familiar inmates of Arkham Asylum, insane and monstrous, powerful beyond Batman's measure. And here is where I'm a bit concerned about the upcoming sequel.
Arkham Asylum was a tight experience, with a small selection of Batman's expansive rogues gallery. The core, immediately recognizable characters were present, with references to a few of the more esoteric members. Arkham City is all about bigger, better, and maybe more explodey. The list of only the most recognizable names from the villains side? The Joker, The Riddler, Poison Ivy, Harley Quinn, Hugo Strange, Two-Face, The Penguin, Mr. Freeze, Talia al Ghul, and Solomon Grundy.
That's a very long list, and it worries me. The biggest mistake superhero media can make when dealing with iconic, established characters is to try to do too much at once, throw too much together in the name of fan-service. The larger the cast, the grander the story has to be, and the more tightly wound it has to be to make sure that the viewers (or players, in the case of a video game) stay interested and aware of what is happening. The fans need to feel that their favorite characters aren't simply there to fill out the ranks, but to actually contribute in some meaningful ways to the action. Spider-Man 3, besides effectively absolving Peter of responsibility for his uncle's death, fell flat because it simply had too much going on. Venom, the return of the Green Goblin, and Sandman (in addition to the whole sub-plot necessary to justify the Venom symbiote) all together in a two-hour-long movie? It's an overload, and the potential impact of each individual story is lost.
This isn't a problem limited to movies and videogames. Whenever a comic company has a major crossover event between its flagship titles, a universe-spanning conflict such as DC's various Crises or Marvel's Civil War, major characters often show up without obvious plot significance, simply because they're iconic and it seems like they should be there. Worse, they can become absolutely central to the plot to the exclusion of the other major characters that others might love. 52 managed to avoid this because it was focused on second-tier heroes, who are more malleable due to the simple fact that people don't care about them as much, allowing for a huge ensemble cast to tell an effective story. Blackest Night worked, to a degree, because it threw out the notion that major, iconic characters were untouchable. Will Arkham City be able to do this with its increased character bloat?
As a more gamer-centric worry, I present Catwoman's appearance. Adding a second playable character takes attention away from the primary reason that people are playing a Batman game in the first place. I doubt the response will be as vehement as it was to the infamous Raiden switcheroo from Metal Gear Solid 2, but I remember playing Ninja Gaiden Sigma and groaning at the additional little levels that had me play as Rachel. I play the game to pretend I'm badass ninja Ryu Hayabusa, not the woman with the war axe.
That said, I'm excited for Arkham City. Apprehensive, yes, but that's at least fifty percent excitement. Arkham Asylum was able to redefine Batman games entirely and this sequel certainly looks to take at least those core gameplay tenets to heart (save the fact that one plays as Catwoman for a portion of the campaign, but even that may be done well. Who knows?) Will it fall victim to the pratfalls of comic-based media in the past? Will it be a new Batman Forever or, heavens forbid, a Batman & Robin? I doubt it, but it's certainly something I hope Rocksteady is keeping a watchful eye out against.

Statistics on food and agriculture have a critical role in designing and targeting policies to reduce hunger, malnutrition and rural poverty. They provide the foundation for evidence-based decision making for governments and the international community, and play an essential role in measuring and monitoring progress towards national and international development goals and targets.
In order to ensure that FAO produces the best possible quality statistics, the International Advisory Group on FAO Statistics (IAGFS) was recently formed and the first meeting took place at headquarters on 19-20 September. The establishment of this Advisory Group marks the beginning of a new dialogue and partnership to improve food security and agricultural statistics at the national, regional and global levels.
The mandate of the IAGFS is to advise FAO on statistical priorities, best practices in data compilation, analysis and dissemination, and on the design and implementation of major FAO statistical projects and capacity development programmes. It follows recent changes made by the Director-General to strengthen internal statistics governance, namely the creation of the role of Chief Statistician and the Inter-Departmental Working Group on Statistics.
The two-day meeting attended by international organizations, Regional Statistical Commissions and FAO Technical Committee Chairs provided a valuable opportunity for gathering input on the FAO statistical programme of work from stakeholders, and represented a significant step towards increasing country engagement and voice in statistical matters.
Opened by the Director-General, the meeting also provided an opportunity to demonstrate a few of the instruments being developed and used to strengthen FAO statistics, such as the implementation of a corporate quality assurance framework, the corporate Statistical Programme of Work 2014-15, and the new Statistical Data Warehouse.
At the IAGFS, FAO reiterated its dedication to developing and strengthening partnerships with international organizations, and the statistics community. Pietro Gennari, Chief Statistician explained how, ‘working together with partners, existing gaps can be transformed into opportunities for collaboration, and the efforts of key stakeholders can be better coordinated and harmonized’.
FAO also committed to continuing to improve the quality of the global public goods that it produces. High profile products such as the undernourishment indicators, the Agricultural Market Information System (AMIS), the FAO Food Price Index, the FAOSTAT corporate database and the State of Food Insecurity publication are some examples of products which are employed worldwide by a variety of external users for information, decision-making and policy development in the fight against hunger.
The changes being made to FAO statistics are key in moving towards a more effective and streamlined statistical system. The Director-General highlighted that these changes ‘will guarantee that more reliable and higher quality data are produced and disseminated by FAO’, and also noted that ‘improved statistics will help FAO to better monitor and understand the impact of its work, at the global and country levels’.
These improvements will also ensure that FAO continues to meet its commitments to member countries, governments and international organizations as an independent and authoritative facilitator and supplier of food security and agricultural statistics.Clubs and Organizations

The former uses the ICP 2005 base estimate of China’s GDP and the national growth rates; version 2 modifies both.
The most important adjustment of China’s PPP for consumption will be of interest to a small group of users and is treated in Part C of the Detailed Documentation. In the end, the PPPs of the basic headings of consumption for household consumption were adjusted upward by 20%.
The modifications of China’s growth rate are based upon earlier work of Angus Maddison and his collaborator Harry Wu; Wu has since updated their work to 2008. Their adjustments also called for an increase in GDP estimates for the sectors of non-material services and agriculture above the official estimates. In 1990, the reference year of Wu’s update, the revision would call for a 5% increase in GDP. Because of the declining importance of agriculture the total adjustment would be about 2% in 2005. This adjustment has not been incorporated into PWT 7.0 in part because it is not clear how it should be distributed on the expenditure side of the accounts. Wu offers a rationale for some additional adjustment of the level of China’s national accounts.
Regional price differences in China are as great or greater than rural-urban differences. Even excluding Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin and Guangdong, where prices are highest, the range across regions is substantial. For rural areas, Guizhou is 60.6% higher than Chongqing; for urban areas, Hainan is 49.8% higher than Chongqing; and for all areas Hainan is 48.9% higher than Chongqing. The differences make clear why it is difficult to move from urban to national prices in a large country like China.
The average prices in the 11 cities in 2000 in the Brandt-Holz study were 20.5% above national urban prices, both sets of prices weighted by urban populations.
One argument against any adjustment is that many other countries only provide urban prices, so why do something special for China. If one wants to compare China with similar countries in its region that only collect urban prices, say Pakistan, then it may make sense to do no adjustment. But even within Asia-Pacific, India does try to cover the whole country including rural areas and the major regional difference between the South and the North. So making no adjustment for China within Asia-Pacific does not provide the best comparison with India or for that matter, most of the very small countries or larger more affluent countries. Nor the best comparison with countries with higher per capita GDPs and more urbanization, like Brazil.
If the interest is getting the best reading of China’s economy against the G-20, then some adjustment seems appropriate. From the standpoint of PWT 7.0, where we are already offering 2 Chinas, with official and adjusted growth rates, it is simple to also offer users a choice of initial 2005 levels.
Our modification of ICP 2005 for China is to make a downward adjustment of 20% to the price level of C that enters into the PWT estimate for 2005. We arrive at 20% by considering a range of estimates and making what we judge to be a conservative adjustment
PPP estimates for 2009 for the largest countries
China is estimated at 11.3 to 11.6 trillion.
India is estimated at 4.15 trillion.

Comment PreferencesUPDATE – – for use throughout flights including take-offs and landings but it may not be put into practice immediately. Note: Devices must remain in ‘airplane mode’.
Listen: Travel expert Rick Seaney on how this will work (and how it won’t).
Ban Expected to Lift by Year’s End
These ‘time-outs’ have long been the bane of passengers who complained about having to stop reading or playing games, and it’s long been the bane of flight attendants who took the heat for enforcing these regulations. However, before anyone attempts to use a device, they must first check with the airline. According to the FAA’s press release, permission will likely be given very soon as, “many carriers will prove to the FAA that their planes allow passengers to safely use their devices in airplane mode, gate-to-gate, by the end of the year.”
Take-offs, Landings
Clarification: As the Wall Street Journal reports, “many airlines’ Wi-Fi systems don’t function at [low] altitude, and if they do, it is up to the airlines to make the connectivity available.” The WSJ has an excellent Q&A on what is or is not permissible and you can see it here.
Still “No” to Phone Calls Anytime
Most passengers won’t have an issue with this: phone calls are still prohibited on all flights.As I've reported here over the last two or three weeks, the hummingbird activity in my yard has been frantic. There have been several Ruby-throated Hummingbirds passing through, but I really had not had much of a chance to get out and observe the action. Until today.
Guess what I found? It's not just RTHs. I've got Rufous Hummingbirds, too!
I'd had a couple of the little birds spend the season with me last winter and I was certainly hoping they would return, but I never expected them this early. As soon as I realized they were here, I went and grabbed my camera and tried to record their presence.
I took my nectar feeders down and scrubbed them and refilled them and a little later I was rewarded by seeing one of the adult males visiting one of them.
Hmmm...I wonder if there might be other hummer species in my yard that I haven't seen yet?
I was getting divebombed by hummers in the garden today. I assume they were RTH's but now I see your photos, I wonder if I had a rufous.
Until recent years, we could pretty much assume that any hummer we saw around here was an RTH, but with the changing climate, more and more different species are turning up in this area. I was surprised not only to see the Rufouses this early but also to see them in numbers. There were at least three or four in my yard today.
Wonderful photos. Amazing detail. It is so hard to get a picture of these guys because they are so fast. Love the pics with the tail feathers fanned out. Great job!
Thanks, Steph. I'm showing you some of the best shots that I took. There were a LOT of others that were just a blur!
Nice!

Development and Training
If gospel workers are to survive and thrive in mission, they need to engage in thorough cross-cultural training. CMS takes training seriously, because we’re about long-term ministry! The Development and Training Team is based at St Andrew’s Hall in Melbourne. They lead CMS’s residential mission training course, as well promoting mission education around Australia. Here are some of the initiatives that CMS are developing:
Mission training for local churches
CMS is partnering with Ridley College in Melbourne to promote a video-based training course in cross-cultural mission. The course is aimed at Christians in local churches who would like to know more about mission and be better equipped to share the gospel with their neighbours. Visit this page if you’d like to find out more.
Training for short-term mission
Missions Interlink Short-Term Training (MIST) is a national training program for people into short-term mission. CMS has played a leading role in developing MIST and helping to run MIST courses around Australia. MIST courses are run regularly in each State around Australia – click here for details.
Cross-cultural Apprenticeships
We have developed an apprenticeship program called Mentac, aimed at helping people explore whether long-term mission is right for them. Mentac apprentices can choose whether to be based in Australia or overseas. See the Mentac page for more details.
Training for long-term mission
Long-term gospel workers serving with CMS come to St Andrew’s Hall in Melbourne for a five month residential training program. The course helps you to prepare for long-term mission, with a focus on practical missiology and anthropology, language learning skills and much more besides. Listen to Mike and Tania reflect on how useful St Andrew’s Hall was in their own preparation:

seriously disrupt a person's life. Many people arrested for DUI are
done so at a police or highway patrol checkpoint. A court case based on
a checkpoint arrest can be far different from one based on a traffic stop,
and the chances of conviction can be affected by the nature of the accusation.
A traffic stop involves probable cause and the officer pulling the driver
over because that officer noticed some sort of driving behavior. In the
case of a DUI, the officer may have noticed that the driver was weaving
across the lane. Once this happens, the officer can detain the driver
to investigate whether or not the driver is under the influence of alcohol
or intoxicated. The officer can smell inside the vehicle for signs of
alcohol or drug use. The officer will make an arrest if he or she determines
that the driver is under the influence of alcohol or drugs. If this case
is brought to court, the prosecution will likely admit the police officer's
testimony, police records of the incident, and any camera footage showing
evidence of intoxication, which will can increase the likelihood of a
conviction.
A DUI checkpoint stop differs from a traffic stop in that the officer does
not have probable cause to stop the vehicle. Because of this fact, the
officer may be limited on what is legally and constitutionally acceptable.
A motorist should NEVER admit to having consumed alcohol. Upon being stopped,
the officers will likely ask the motorist “How much have you had
to drink this evening?” Motorists should understand that there is
only one right answer to that question, “I have not been drinking,
officer.” Admitting to have consumed any alcohol, even two beers,
is an admission by the motorist of having broken the law. In many states,
a motorist has a right to not answer any questions when being stopped
without probable cause.
Legal experts in New York have contested the notion that motorists have the right to
remain silent when questioned at a DUI checkpoint. The police officers
at the checkpoint will not discuss these rights because they would prefer
the DUI suspect self-incriminate and make the prosecution's case solid.
If you find yourself at a checkpoint after consuming any amount of alcohol
or drugs, your best defense is avoiding self-incrimination. Don’t
refuse to answer the officer’s questions. However, there is no need
to assist the officer in his or her investigation against you. Be courteous
and do not argue with the officers. The officer may repeat these questions
and use a bit of intimidation to get the evidence needed, so you must
stay firm, calm, and respectful.
The logic in this case is simple; once the officer notices that you have
any indication of having consumed an intoxicating substance, you will
be arrested, and the prosecution will begin to build a case against you.
After your arrest for suspicion of driving under the influence, you should
find a knowledgeable and skilled
NYC DUI lawyer with whom to discuss your case. Let your lawyer know if you have admitted
to any consumption of alcohol. With all the facts, your lawyer may gain
an acquittal or even get your case dismissed before trial.
Please do not hesitate to
contact us with any further questions on the law and your rights concerning DUI checkpoint
traffic stops.Motorized Rolling Shades

The BUSD board’s 5-0 vote April 15 authorized an agreement with the County of San Diego for a County Library kiosk on the property which also includes Bonsall Elementary School.
“I just think it’s a great use for the community center,” said BUSD superintendent Justin Cunningham.
The lease is for a five-year period. The county will pay the Bonsall school district $1 rent for the entire 60-month term, and the county will also pay $100 monthly to cover the cost of electrical usage at the site.
In September 2012, the Board of Supervisors approved the sole-source procurement of a kiosk and associated software for a 24/7 Library-To-Go pilot project at the County Operations Center. County Library director Jose Aponte expects a total of between four and 10 kiosks throughout the county within the next decade based on community input and feasibility studies. In addition to being in small communities where a staffed library would not be financially feasible, the kiosks may also be placed at commuter rail or light rail hubs.
“The 24/7 is like the library’s counterpart to the Redbox. We afford people access 24 hours a day, seven days a week to the library’s variety of resources,” Aponte said.
The County Library system has approximately 1.5 million books, compact discs, digital video discs, and other materials. Approximately 400 items will be available in each kiosk, although a library patron making reservations from home, either by telephone or over the Internet, can reserve material either at a branch library or at a 24/7 Library-To-Go kiosk and the material would be placed at the branch library or in the kiosk for pickup a few days later.
“People will be able to reserve materials,” Aponte said. “It’s part of this whole amazonization of the library world. You look for a resource online.”
Patrons can also check circulation materials and make reservations from the kiosks. The kiosks will also have library program information, and patrons can register for a library card at the kiosks. Materials checked out from a branch library may be returned to a kiosk while materials checked out from a kiosk can be returned to a branch library. Users may also pay fines for overdue material at the kiosks, which will accept payment by credit card.
“I think it’s a great application of technology,” Cunningham said. “It’s great to have technology be able to bring the libraries out to the rural communities.”
The County Operations Center kiosk has been serving library patrons for approximately six months. The Bonsall Community Center kiosk will be the County Library system’s second 24/7 Library-To-Go.
“It’s important for us to find library services outside of our current parameters,” Aponte said.
“I thought it was a good opportunity to serve the community,” Cunningham said.
The passage of the Bonsall unification measure in the November 2012 election will turn the K-8 Bonsall Union School District into the K-12 Bonsall Unified School District as of July 1, 2014, although a transitional unified district with the same board as the elementary school district was created in February 2013 to handle transitional matters. Because Bonsall Elementary School is on the same premises as the Bonsall Community Center, the approval occurred during the Bonsall Union School District meeting although the Bonsall Unified School District will take over the lease arrangements.
County Library will be responsible for the kiosk’s day-to-day operations; staff from the Fallbrook branch will handle shelving functions twice each weekday. County Library will also be responsible for ongoing maintenance and any
needed repairs.
“We invite the community to be part of this next step in library services,” Aponte said.
The 24/7 Library-To-Go kiosk in Bonsall is expected to be operational in May. “Look forward to the ribbon cutting,” Aponte said.
Great idea! Thank you!

AbstractWe used waveform data from the 1999 SHIPS (Seismic Hazard Investigation of Puget Sound) seismic refraction experiment to constrain the attenuation structure of the Seattle basin, Washington State. We inverted the spectral amplitudes of compressional- and shear-wave arrivals for source spectra, site responses, and one- and two-dimensional Q-1 models at frequencies between 1 and 40 Hz for P waves and 1 and 10 Hz for S waves. We also obtained Q-1 models from t* values calculated from the spectral slopes of P waves between 10 and 40 Hz. One-dimensional inversions show that Qp at the surface is 22 at 1 Hz, 130 at 5 Hz, and 390 at 20 Hz. The corresponding values at 18 km depth are 100, 440, and 1900. Qs at the surface is 16 and 160 at 1 Hz and 8 Hz, respectively, increasing to 80 and 500 at 18 km depth. The t* inversion yields a Qp model that is consistent with the amplitude inversions at 20 and 30 Hz. The basin geometry is clearly resolved in the t* inversion, but the amplitude inversions only imaged the basin structure after removing anomalously high-amplitude shots near Seattle. When these shots are removed, we infer that Q-1 values may be ???30% higher in the center of the basin than the one-dimensional models predict. We infer that seismic attenuation in the Seattle basin will significantly reduce ground motions at frequencies at and above 1 Hz, partially countering amplification effects within the basin.

The Jagged ResumeWashington Governor Proposes Taxes For Schools.
Gregoire, a Democrat, also wants the legislature to enact a new wholesale excise tax on gasoline and diesel that would ratchet up over the next six years in order to "fully fund" Washington's new obligations to pick up more of the tab for school bus transportation.
The tax proposals are part of the Governor's final budget blueprint before leaving office.
Her successor did not embrace the plan. In a statement, Governor-elect Jay Inslee thanked Gregoire for her “thoughtful effort” and said he will “lay out his own budget priorities that reflect his vision for state government.”
Gregoire also proposes to close a $900 million shortfall in the next two year budget with a combination of cuts and revenues. On the revenue side of the ledger, Gregoire would repeal a fuel use tax exemption that she says primarily benefits oil refiners. That would raise $63 million in the next budget. Gregoire would also extend the Hospital Safety Net Assessment, also known as a "bed tax," to raise $276 million over the next two years. Hospitals have traditionally lobbied for the Assessment because it triggers additional Medicaid match dollars from the federal government.
In a press release announcing the budget, Gregoire says without these additional revenues the state would have to:
- Eliminate the state-only funded Food Assistance program for legal immigrants who do not qualify for the federal food stamp program
- Reduce levy equalization money, which goes to property-tax-poor school districts, by $100 million
- Cut higher education by $52 million across-the-board
In response, State Senator Andy Hill, R-Redmond, the apparent new chair of the budget-writing Ways and Means committee, put out a statement that says in part, "we are moving forward under the assumption that additional taxes are not an option."
In her final budget, Gregoire also proposes to increase funding for some of her signature programs.
- $50 million for additional early learning/pre-school enrollment slots
- $20 million to expand science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) at public colleges and universities
- $19 million for cash-starved state parks
In recent weeks, Gregoire has lamented that she was unable to dedicate more money toward the clean up of Puget Sound. However, her proposed operating, transportation and capital budgets, taken together, fund $500 million worth of projects aimed at protecting Puget Sound.
Gregoire's last budget could serve as a roadmap for Governor-elect Jay Inslee, also a Democrat. However, he campaigned on a no-new-taxes platform. Additionally, the coalition of Republicans and two Democrats who recently announced they will form a majority to lead the state Senate have said taxes will not be part of their solution to the state's ongoing budget woes.

2013-15 Budget & Policy Highlights
9(MDAyNTQ1NzQ1MDEyMjk0OTcxNTI4MzljZQ001))Horoscope 25 July 2017
ARIES (March 21 – April 20):
You need to give both your mind and your body time to recover from recent exertions. With Mercury moving into the well-being area of your chart today you must realize that you don’t have to work twice as hard as everyone else to get ahead.
TAURUS (April 21 – May 21):
If you want something passionately enough you can find a way to bring it into your life. You mind is a powerful tool and if you can learn to control and direct it then all things will be possible over the next few days. Try it and see.
GEMINI (May 22 – June 21):
You may be reluctant to change your way of thinking but even you can see that the way you have been approaching the world in recent weeks has been holding you back. Gemini is known as a flexible sign, so move with the times.
CANCER (June 22 – July 23):
Be careful that in your haste to put across your point of view you don’t say hurtful things. It may not matter now but it will matter later on when you need help from the people you have criticized so harshly. Do you think you will get it?
LEO (July 24 – Aug. 23):
The more someone tries to convince you that they can be trusted the more determined you must be not to let them get their hands on your cash. You may be the trusting sort but you are not so gullible as to fall for their sales patter. Are you?
VIRGO (Aug. 24 – Sept. 23):
As Mercury, your ruler and planet of communication, moves into your sign today you will feel the need to express yourself loudly and forcefully. That’s good. Make sure everyone knows that you mean business and that your opinions count for something.
LIBRA (Sept. 24 – Oct. 23):
You may be reluctant to come down hard on someone who has been taking liberties but you must. If you let them get away with this kind of anti-social behaviour they will take it as a sign that they can do as they please. Don’t let that happen.
SCORPIO (Oct. 24 – Nov. 22):
It may seem as if you are out of step with friends and family at the moment but that’s okay. In fact it’s better than okay, it’s very good indeed. If you want to get on in life you have to take chances, and risk making a few enemies.
SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 23 – Dec. 21):
If you come in for criticism from someone today you must take heed of what they say. You could, of course, dismiss their remarks as sour grapes but they are nothing of the kind. They just don’t want to see you make a fool of yourself.
CAPRICORN (Dec. 22 – Jan. 20):
Your mind will start operating on a much higher level over the next few days. What seemed so hard to understand yesterday will suddenly be perfectly clear to you and you will wonder how on earth you did not “get it” before.
AQUARIUS (Jan. 21 – Feb. 19):
A financial issue that seemed so problematical earlier in the month will now reveal itself to be ridiculously simple and you will kick yourself mentally for wasting so many precious hours worrying yourself sick about it. Get over it and move on.
PISCES (Feb. 20 – Mar. 20):
A relationship problem that has been causing you sleepless nights can and must be resolved. With mind planet Mercury moving into your opposite sign you will find it easier to stand back from the situation and see the solution. See it and act.5 Reviews

I scaled back for 1 muffin (I used a wholegrain English muffin) and loved the hint of the Madras curry powder, I used the green onion but omitted the olives and thoroughly enjoyed, thank you Sharon123, made for Name That Ingredient.
These were awesome! I used Thomas 100 calorie wheat English muffins,low fat mayo and fat free cheese. I used the green onion but not curry powder(I've never had that). I replaced it with garlic powder. I really,REALLY enjoyed these for lunch! I liked the tang that the green olive gave. I will be making these again. Thanks so much for posting!! :)
Easy to make, liked the olives and green onions in this, but did not quite hit the spot. Not sure why, as we like all the components. I might try again with less mayonnaise. Still, something I would make again to accompany soup as a light lunch.
Made these as a snack last night and everyone (including 3 picky children) enjoyed them.
This was great Sharon. I made just one, for myself for lunch today, and I really enjoyed it. I think this would be a terrific last minute cocktail snack for guests. It's so easy and uses ingredients that I always have on hand. I LOVED the flavor of the green olives - YUM!

"Wonderfully Grim, Austere, Beautiful Beowulf"..The word “relationship” is defined as; the way in which two or more concepts, objects, or people are connected, or the state of being connected. Basically meaning the way in which two or more people, or organizations, regard and behave toward each other. In the band world it is detrimental, to the future of a music organization, that its band leaders create and build upon relationships throughout their profession. Few relationships are more important than that of the high school band director and the college band director.
On February, 3 2017 we initiated a mass survey of high school band directors in the states of North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. This survey was apart of a broader study on the relationships between High School and HBCU band programs within NC, SC, and GA. Our hope is that the data collected will give some incite on the relationships, which will either expose a broken system that is in need of repair or highlight the benefits of a successful working relationship.

Marc Robinson got the Buccaneers on the board at the 23:06 mark off an assist from Tony Racine. Jackson Wilkins gave Beloit some insurance nine minutes later with a penalty kick score to make it 2-0 into the half.
The insurance goal paid off when the Blueboys scored with under six minutes remaining to cut the deficit in half. But the Bucs held on for the key Midwest Conference win.
BJ Kiser made four saves in net.
The Buccaneers have a week off before continuing their drive for a spot in the MWC Tournament in the regular-season finale at Monmouth College. Kickoff is set for 2:30 p.m.Fundamentals Course 25 Oct - 15 Nov

But this one does so much more. And the good thing, us adults can certainly use a brush-up on our knowledge of the American Presidents.
* The 2nd president of the United States was John Adams. The 16th President was none other than Abraham Lincoln. And the state that can claim the most presidents...is either Virginia, Ohio or a tie, depending on how you count where William Henry Harrison was from.

but Cole's manager tweeted a quote from Never Let Me Down
Never Let Me Down being revived would be amazin.
do we really need to remake songs from 6 years ago?
u know how hard it is to make a hot track without a sample and im being dead serious
your a idiot we know
Remaking the sampling, that'd be dope. Technology for sound has advanced a lot since then..
flashing lights aint a sample neither and its one of his best workkanye a genius
I don't believe paranoid was sampled either and it was hot
Paranoid is a sample from Alan Parsons Project's song "Standing On Higher Ground"
No disrespect... But you are in Nuclear War with a Swiss army knife trying to defend Kanye West as a non sampling creative producer... He falls in the category of a great beat maker...
Just because dude is getting "A's" in Algebra doesn't mean he should go around telling everyone he knows Quantum Physics and Calculus.
Not a good look.. Especially when you run up on someone with a PhD... Hence the Quincy Jones and Kanye West exchange that happen not to long ago...
Dude is good at what he does... I listen with that in mind... and I think everyone else should simply do the same...
Name a few of his hits that are not based around a sample
What if its all falls down
No wonder it was his worst recieved album, that pretty much rubber stamps my point emphatically. The album where he tried to be original the most was the album his fans hate most.
He definitely learned his lesson for his next album cause he went to town sampling again having realized his own beats didnt cut the mustard
It has nothing to do with the fact that it's his darkest album or the fact that it features him singing not rapping, or maybe because he deliberately didn't make music for the sake of sales (which no doubt, is why you listen to music, because it sells well)? No, you're going to take your idiotic argument of Kanye's original music being garbage so he has to sample or "steal" music.
My question is, why are you even here? Nobody with any sense agrees with your thoughts and you've contradicted your own self several times. You've pointed out how Kanye has five writers, but multiple Em songs have as many as four writers.
Your problem with Kanye is he's black and he interrupted Taylor Swift. Let's be honest here. You're tired of the black man Kanye being liked better or critically lauded more than your God Eminem. That's your problem. I don't see you running your little Euro self into DJ Premiere threads, Nas threads, or any other rappers threads talking this sample bullsh*t. You have a personal beef with Kanye. Just let it out and you'll be free.SAN JOSE, Calif., Dec. 6 (UPI) —
The man who has been leaving "Tips for Jesus" in the thousands for restaurant servers across the United States has been revealed as a former PayPal executive.
Tech gossip blog Valleywag said it has confirmed Jack Selby — a former PayPal vice president and part of a group dubbed the "PayPal Mafia" when they left the company with massive payouts — is behind the tips, made in college towns on football game days, and the @tipsforjesus Instagram account that chronicled the generous payments.
Selby’s massive tips include a $10,000 gratuity on a $3,000 booze tab he and his friends racked up and a $1,000 tip left for a server who brought him tacos.
Valleywag said friends revealed Selby, who has not publicly acknowledged his deeds, dubbed his project "Tips for Jesus" as a joke, and the tips really have no religious purpose.Maria Henry (Nee Hardy) (born 1851)

DECADE from Bath, England comprises of Alex Sears, Connor Fathers, Dan Clarke, Harry Norton & Joe Marrine.
The guys have hit the road with Hey Vanity and Light You Up and have just released a video ‘Coffin’.
Our very own Scriba Pontificus had a listen:
Reminiscent of the early Foo Fighters – this has the same sort of melodic jangle and completeness of soul.
It bounces, when necessary – with joy and uncontrolled lust – yet the song is full of insight and feeling.
It is filled with introspection and sentiment. The creativity and musicianship is outstanding – and it’s all gone in a flash … much like life itself.

Tonya J | December 20, 21:34 CET
daedreams | December 20, 23:42 CETBy now you’re probably aware of Twitter. If you haven’t it’s a very difficult service to explain to the newbie. You can try Wikipedia’s article but I’m not going to spend any time explaining the service here. Today I’m going to explain a few things about Twitter and their ability to pay salaries. We will start with the most basic for the non-business minded and expand into the business models.
Basic Twitter
The shortest answer to the question “How Does Twitter Make Money?” is they don’t make money. That’s right, for three years, Twitter has basically been in a money pit. Someone has been pumping money into Twitter though to keep it afloat. After all they have bills to pay and a few dozen employees who have need to eat. For a company to not make money and stay alive they must have investors. Investors give Twitter money in exchange for partial ownership and the rights to a cut of future profits (if there are any).
These investors are called “venture capitalists” or VCs. VCs are companies where wealthy individuals or organizations can bring their money together to help fund companies just getting their feet wet with a promising future. Facebook, Google, and YouTube are all companies that received VC funding to help get launched. According to Crunchbase Twitter has gone through three rounds of raising money from VCs. The link includes a list of companies that have invested, you likely have not heard of any of them.
Advertising Business Models
Internet companies have limited options with business models. You go to their website, read whatever is there, and move on. With Weakonomics I make money by putting advertisements up around the blog. Twitter could easily do the same thing on the Twitter homepage and next week be giving out Teslas as business cards. They could also place ads in your Twitter stream where it would look like a Tweet, perhaps with a link. But Twitter has shied away from this model. I don’t blame them because dealing with advertisers can be a pain rear and perhaps ruin the look of the site or service.
Paid Content
Perhaps then Twitter will seek an income by charging users to access their service. Maybe they bill you $1 per month to use Twitter. I could charge my readers $1 per month to access my site but I would likely end up with one reader, my mom. Twitter wo
uld encounter a similar problem with a similar (percentage) reduction in users.
A more appropriate model would be to offer a basic service for free and then charge for premium content or features. Xbox Live has had success with this, bloggers see it with Sitemeter, you see this with TV too (over the air is free and you pay for cable or satellite). Features would be beneficial for companies or people willing to pay anywhere from $1 to $500 a month for access to them. This could be link tracking, extended character length, embedded media, or priority access to their API.
Other Options
Twitter could take a page from Yammer. Yammer is a service very similar to Twitter that offers the same system for business users. This allows for internal twittering at companies. Yammer charges companies a fee in order to obtain the administrative rights to their company’s Yammer account. Twitter could do the exact same thing, or perhaps offer dedicated software to companies/departments that want to host a twitter-like service on their own servers. This would be a great way for the company to diversify a bit in the future.
Wrap-Up
I’ll remind you again that at this time Twitter has no official business model. They’ve played with advertising on their Japanese Twitter site to some degree of success and there are rumblings of a premium account option for businesses. We are certain that Twitter is planning on making some money this year . If you enjoy Twitter as much as I do, then you’ll be anxious to see what they roll out. Good luck Twitter, we wish you the best.

Hey reader! This post is very popular among Googlers looking for how Twitter makes money. Some of you may have noticed this post is almost a year old, and a lot can happen in a year. I wanted to let you know that their situation hasn’t changed, but once it does, I’ll be sure to update this post. Thanks for reading!

when we believed in the Lord Jesus Christ,
who was I that I could hinder, God?”
-Acts 11: 17
God’s door is open. Who are we to stand in the way? Anyone who participated in last week’s National Multicultural Conference in Charlotte, NC still has those words ringing in our ears.
From the theme song written by Bruce Harding especially for the event, to our preachers, our tracks, and our celebrations, this open door is more than a slogan to us. It is a place we crossed into anew in the days we spent together.
Multicultural conferences are my favorite denominational events to attend. They are like a booster shot of Holy Spirit power and vision. We catch a glimpse of the redemptive possibilities for us as Church in all its joy and in all its pain.
The Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) at large says lots of things these days about growing the church deep and wide, about being inclusive, multicultural, and cross-cultural and all the other current buzz words we want to use to describe ourselves. Despite this rhetoric, the worshipping communities that have the PCUSA symbol out in front of their church buildings tend to be almost totally filled with white middle to upper class professionals who listen exclusively to organ music, sing from the blue hymnal, and read from a bulletin written only in English.
This disconnect between rhetoric and reality is where we encounter most potently God’s open door. The sharp edge at that threshold is not about rhetoric—it is about relationships. The open door is a dangerous place: we can’t cross through it without being changed in the most intimate ways. And this transformative power of the open door is something so many of us felt last week.
If any came to the Multicultural Conference last week and didn’t have a good time, they must have slept through it. And if any came and were not confronted in some way by their own blind spots then they were not paying attention. Multicultural ministry is really about coming to know ourselves with more clarity, with the veil lifted, with the doors open not just to the church, but to our very hearts.
Where are you vulnerable? Where are you afraid? Where are you holding on for dear life? Encountering an open door in those places may be something we brace ourselves for or avoid for a long, long time. But one thing is for sure; you walk through when you’ve arrived there and no sooner. No one can pull you through. There are no short cuts.
I am always thankful to witness the different places where people are on their journeys at these events. And I marvel at how much I learn about myself and my own limitations and possibilities.
Some people come who still have a lot of resistance and apprehension. Others are fully present and feast on the abundance of inspiration and generosity of the event. Others are restless to think of returning home to churches where this open door vision is not only foreign to their community, but it is undesirable and avoided at all cost. Still others come and wake up in a new way to what’s waiting for them back at home—perhaps a nesting fellowship they had held at arms length or a subtle gathering of new ideas they had previously seen as problematic.
As the co-chair of the planning team I have participated in this event during the last two years from conception to gestation to birth. The blessings are more than I can innumerate. The most startling thing is how generous God was in the teaching moments, in the struggles, and in how challenges and triumphs poetically made their way through the work and the relationships.
Two years ago I thought about quitting this effort almost before it got started because of a string of disappointments and conflicts and then the sting of being misunderstood in a profound way by another member of the planning team. I felt like there was no way he was going to ever see me for who I really am. I worried that working together was going to be impossible and I just wasn’t up for impossible.
I took a risk to keep serving on as the co-chair of this committee. I was making myself vulnerable to more disappointment, frustration, and misunderstanding. And there was a part of me that really didn’t want to keep going.
God’s call seems to work this way sometimes—you know it is a call because you would not have chosen it yourself. The generosity of God’s step-by-step power kept me grafted into this effort. The authenticity of it is what made it such a blessing, and that authenticity can only be God-given.
Getting out of God’s way for me meant not taking things personally and at the same time not being afraid to take personal risks in building relationships. All along the way these opportunities kept coming our way as a planning team—to connect as real people even as we saw our efforts as much bigger than ourselves. It is rare to experience a team who accomplishes so much together at the same time that it deals with as many disappointments, stressors, roadblocks, and unknowns as we did.
If there is one thing I can say without a doubt it is that this conference was in no way superficial or built on empty rhetoric. This conference was the unfolding of God-given vision and messy relationships. It is the child of high and dashed hopes. And the music we made, the dances we danced, the lessons we learned, and the stories we told were truth: spontaneous, idiosyncratic, and beautiful truth.
In the homestretch of our preparations we experienced the seemingly obligatory staff turnover from Louisville. And we were grieved by the dismissal of almost the entire presbytery staff in Charlotte just a few days before the event. God’s open door does not come without the intermittent attempts of others to slam it shut in your face. It is inspiring to see how so many of my colleagues on the design team continued to give their all to this effort even after they lost their jobs.
Each morning of the conference we began our design team meetings with silence and a candle lit as an emblem of our trust in God. We were not doing this work for any institution, but for God and to be more faithful in our walk as Jesus followers.
That clarity of purpose makes encountering challenges not a personal affront. Instead we recognize it as par for the course when we follow Jesus. He kept us going because his love gives us a way to feel the freedom of God’s open door.
I will always remember this team and this conference for its clarity of purpose and its joy. When all was said and done, God cleared a space for us to laugh, dance, sing, and fall in love again with what Church can be.
I will also remember another person, not on the team, who confronted me during the conference with some difficult feelings, some things that were hard to hear. Again, I felt misunderstood just like I had when my work on this event had barely gotten started. And I felt the hard barriers between this person and me because of my whiteness, because of her experience with white people who I do not even know, and because even with the best intentions I can still mess up.
Intermingled with all the delight of our multi-lingual, multi-generational, multi-ethnic together-in-one-place experience was the pain and sadness of this conversation. She may never be able to see me for who I really am. I unintentionally hurt her because of my race, an accident of my birth, and an undeniable part of my identity. That is a deeply painful truth.
At the same time her feelings were hard to hear, she gave me a great, great gift. Hearing and receiving difficult feelings from people is painful but it is connection and relationships. And it is not just about my connection with this person who told me honestly about her feelings. It is much deeper than that.
The pain we both felt is not just ours, but it taps into a deep aquifer of connection to the tears and wounds of generations of human beings who have misunderstood each other, hurt each other, and struggled to see the finger prints of God in their troubled connections. The tears I cried were for all of us—for all the ways we fail to meet each other where we really are in our heart of hearts.
Multicultural ministry is open door ministry—and that means hearts open to the collective pain in which we share both culpability and victimization. And this kind of ministry is impossible without a constantly evolving sense of our selves in that ambiguous and conflicted identity.
My work in the multicultural movement comes from my heart—and it keeps it beating at the same time that it continues to break.
Robust life and grief.
Disappointment and delight.
Any multicultural conference worth its salt has it all. God knows we need it that way in order to get out of the way of the multitude who seek a new world, and to get out of the way of ourselves so we can truly find the person God created us to be.
Being present in those open door moments helps me to remember that I move back and forth through that door all the time. Sometimes I am on the side inviting others through to an expansive life-giving place. And sometimes I am waiting for an invitation to walk through to an even more generous space.
Sometimes the gifts God gives us at this open door are not simply open arms and celebrations, but truth and a chance to go even deeper into the healing power that resides in each of us, the flame of Christ that flickers there.
God’s door is open. Who are we to stand in the way? May we all find the grace to answer that question with more than just words, but with our broken and beating hearts.

Multicultural conferences are my favorite. I find being in the midst of a Pentecost experience profoundly moving. During those few days when cultures and gender, ethnicities and languages, generations and backgrounds are celebrated, we are able to see and hear from heaven’s perspective the world as God intended.
We grapple with those things that we say are no longer issues in our society, yet we know in our hearts that the “not in my back yard” mentality has yet to be abolished. We converge with one common purpose: to stand at God’s door willing to invite all of God’s children in and willing to cross the threshold when invited.
The conversations we have and the sermons we hear during the conference can be uncomfortable. They can be revealing. They allow us an opportunity to celebrate our successes. They inspire us to new heights. Sometimes they bring us face to face with a fellow child of God who steps on our toes. It is during each of those moments that we have the opportunity and the privilege to embrace who we are; the wonderful work that God created us to be. It is our imperfections after all, that give us character and make us stronger.
I had the honor and the privilege of serving on the planning team for this year’s 2012 conference. After two long years of meetings and more meetings, hour-long conference calls, 12 drafts of the schedule, registration confusion and the heart breaking news of the Charlotte Presbytery staff losing their jobs (which made up 40% of our planning team) we birthed an amazing conference last week. The friendships that we made, the stumbling blocks that were conquered and laughter that was shared happened because God’s grace is sufficient. Not because any one member has special powers, a magic wand tucked away in their closet or because everything was perfect along the way. We learned to make sacrifices for the betterment of the group. We accepted each other differences. We were able to weave together a relationship that was strong enough to withstand the difficult times and because when things got difficult, we stopped and we prayed with each other.
If you asked me two months ago, would I be on a planning team again I would have told you “NO WAY. It’s too much work”. But go ahead and ask me now. Nothing would stop me from saying yes. I have made some incredible, unexpected friendship in some unexpected ways that I will treasure forever. Friendship where we must be intentional about staying in contact with each other. I have drawn closer to my “Road Dogs” (my friends who have travelled across the country from conference to conference together).
My passion for multicultural ministry is something in which I am fully vested. Some people don’t understand the depth of my passion but sit down with me for a little while and I’ll tell you about a man I know and his vision, he’s a good God.

Thank you for taking the time to share these reflections, Kate. I especially appreciate that feeling of “NO WAY” that turned into “Nothing can stop me.” God is good! I also like how you say that it wasn’t any one person. Amen to that. That was the beauty of the effort–how each of us simply needed to be ourselves and do what we do well. When we gave each other room to do that, wonderful things happened–just like 1 Corinthians describes about the one body, many parts. It was so good to have an experience of that in full flourish. I will be ever thankful for the way you blessed this effort with your gifts and your loving, prophetic heart. So glad to think of future work and friendship together, too! Thanks for reading and commenting.

I so often feel isolated in my ways of understanding my privilege as a white person as so many feel that privilege is only defined by rich white men. I feel such a lack of comprehension when trying to explain why it pains me so when my race unintentionally causes pain in my relationships with people of color…as always you remind me I am not the only one who sees this painful reality in our world!! Love you!

Thank you, Andrea. You are right, because our culture hasn’t given us a lot of healthy ways to look critically and honestly at white privilege, trying to articulate it, trying to notice it and find healing can be very isolating and very painful. It is slow work and it takes being vulnerable to some difficult realizations. This work also creates opportunities for us to find more generous spaces for authentic relationships and profound growth and change. I know you have given a lot of yourself to this kind of work. Keep telling the truth and and honoring the beautiful potential in your own hopes and dreams within it all. So good to hear from you!
Peace,

My Father's family moved to a new house and found a sword with the markings Parson & Co. It said it was made in St. Louis, Mo. I'm am trying to trace the history of the sword. Did anyone in your family ever know a D.W. Heath? That was the name on the sword. There was no date but it appears fairly old. It has an ivory handle with knights on it. It had the latin words IN HOC SIGNO VINCES. On the blade there is an Arabian Nights scene. If you have any info please e~mail me at angelglam@hotmail.com. Thank you.

Watch Paul Allen's report on the meeting between the two Korean leaders Roh's spokesman said: "We estimate that the talks were sufficient and candid and have achieved good results. President Roh himself said he was satisfied with the outcome."
Watch Paul Allen's report on the meeting between the two Korean leaders
Roh had said he wanted the summit to mark the start of a genuine peace process. He has suggested he is ready to increase aid to the impoverished North Korean economy.
More than 50 years after a ceasefire halted the Korean War, North and South remain officially at war and there are hopes that this summit might finally pave the way to a formal peace treaty.

At Tuesday's welcoming ceremony, the North Korean leader barely smiled and exchanged only a few words with his guest.
Later Kim also failed to show up at an evening banquet thrown by the North Koreans, instead sending his deputy, Kim Yong-nam, to play host.
The body language was in stark contrast to the enthusiastic reception given to Kim Dae-jung, the then South Korean president, during the first inter-Korean summit in 2000.
A tale of two welcomes... Kim Jong-il on Tuesday, left; and, right, in 2000 [GALLO/GETTY]
Seven years ago the North Korean leader spent over two hours with the South Korean on the day he arrived, compared with barely 12 minutes given to Roh.
But at their meeting on Wednesday the frost appeared to have thawed somewhat, with Kim repeatedly smiling and noticeably more animated as he welcomed Roh to their first formal round of talks.

The meeting began with an exchange of gifts, with Roh giving his host a bookcase containing DVDs of South Korean soap operas and films starring Lee Young-ae, believed to be Kim's favourite actress.
The North Korean leader is known to be a film fan and is said to have a vast personal movie library.
According to South Korean pool reports, the talks at the Paekhwawon state guest house in Pyongyang included Roh speaking of his concern about the summer floods in North Korea that left some 600 dead or missing.
The floods, which also left tens of thousands homeless, had caused the summit to be pushed back from its originally scheduled date in late August.
No agenda
Later the South Korean president is scheduled to attend an evening performance of the North Korean propaganda spectacle known as the "mass games".
It was not known if Kim would also attend.
Roh, who is in the final five months of an unpopular presidency, is under heavy pressure to bring with him concrete results when he heads back to Seoul on Thursday.
Critics in the South have said the summit is aimed at boosting domestic political support and unlikely to achieve much.
Roh has given few specifics about what he will propose or seek from the North Koreans during the summit.
Before travelling to Pyongyang, a senior aide to Roh described the summit objectives as "peace, prosperity and reconciliation, and otherwise open-ended".
Many want Roh to raise the issue of the North's nuclear weapons programme and human rights during the summit.
But sceptics say he is unlikely to touch on sensitive subjects for fear of offending his host.

How the hell is a website supposed to pay for expenses on a not-for-profit website if they don't have ads. I. - Ad-Block Plus, Peerblock, AVG Safe Search with Link Scanner, and more can block it, for example, I am on here and all I see is what I type and above, I don't even have to see that stupid Justin Bieber sidebar thing with the hidden link that extends three inches to the left of it.

September 13, 2012 at 9:28 am
Christian... Larry specifically stated "video" ads. Thus, obviously he has no problem with the other ads. Another factor is Adblock (Plus) only works on Firefox. Maybe he's not using Firefox or prefers not to when navigating DYAC.
Thaddeus Warner:
September 14, 2012 at 2:06 am
Brian Joslyn Adblock Plus is available for Chrome (I'm using it right now).
I've never seen a video ad on this site with ABP. I recommend it to everyone
September 14, 2012 at 4:23 pm
Brian, before getting all "Hey, I'm smarter than you!" why don't you take a look at the Chrome apps. There IS AdBlock for Chrome. I'm using Chrome right now, and hey, guess what, I have AdBlock running.
Maybe do a bit of research before you start telling people that they're wrong.
September 15, 2012 at 1:32 am
Good rebuttal there, Brian. Considering I was commenting on the fact that you said, and I quote, "Chrome doesn't offer any such thing... it's offered for use on Firefox" your response to me means absolutely nothing. AdBlock Plus IS available for Chrome, even though you sit there and say it is not.
Now, would you like to respond to what I actually said to you, and not come up with some garbage about how it is junk, which has nothing to do with what I said to you?
September 15, 2012 at 1:40 am
Boyd, Brian just doesn't understand. And his comment of "if you have a problem with ads online then you shouldn't be online" is a garbage argument. It's one where the person has absolutely nothing of relevance to say, so they say something that makes themselves feel better.
I'm all for no ads online. I don't need to see ads online. I will never see any ad online that will make me want to buy something. I know all I need to know by my own research. No ad will push me in one direction or another.
September 15, 2012 at 1:47 am
Aww, you're kinda touchy, aren't you? And no, you did NOT respond to my "meaningless nonsense." You mentioned me in your post, but then responded about something completely different. I called you out about Adblock Plus being available for Chrome. Your response to me wasn't even close to mentioning anything about it being available for Chrome.
Again, next time you want to tell someone that something is or is not a certain way, you should research before saying anything. Don't want to look like an idiot now, do you?
September 15, 2012 at 2:01 am
Ok, last time I try to explain this to you. I said NOTHING about ads. Not a thing. I mentioned one thing, that Adblock is available for Chrome, countering what you said, that it was NOT available for Chrome. When you responded to me, you didn't say, "Yes, you were right" or "No, you're wrong," you started in about how it is junk. I never said anything about whether it was junk or not. I never said anything about if ads should be blocked or not. I just said, "You're wrong, it is available on Chrome." Seriously, look back up, and see what I said, then look at what you said! You didn't say anything back to me about it being available, not until a few comments later!
Wow man, I think I'm done with you. You really do NOT understand.
September 15, 2012 at 2:08 am
You need explain ANYTHING to me. I need not read back. You didn't need to specifically mention ads, you implied them by mentioning AB(P). I know I stated it's junk, because it is... and it's a valid factor in such a discussion as this.
The fact remains... I DO understand.
September 15, 2012 at 2:17 am
Understandable Boyd... and I thank you for having the respect to not only state but imply more specifically that it's time for this to end. However, there's technically no debate. I realize that advertising is simply part of life. It's everywhere. As far as online advertising, I know PLENTY about how it works and don't appreciate my true and factual knowledge, although stated in my own words, being disrespected (especially with harassment as a result).
I've not done nor said anything wrong... thus, it's not my responsibility to cease this nonsense. That is, despite the fact that I have PLENTY better (and more important) things to do.
September 15, 2012 at 2:28 am
So now you've harassed me again, Boyd. If only you were right on ANY of the disrespectful assumptions you made. Despite the fact that it's none of your business what all I have to do, I will say that one thing just happens to involve.With just three episodes remaining in the entire series, ‘Dexter’ is racing towards its finish line.

I originally reached out to her for website design a few years ago, when I saw a write up about her Classic Creole cookbook. My Dad is a huge New Orleans food lover and I love to cook, so this cookbook sounded amazing. She kept me in mind as she developed this new website idea that focuses on everyone being able to share their own unique family recipes. Do you have a hilarious family recipe? This website allows you to upload your own story, family photos and recipe and then gives you a unique URL to share with your friends. Check out the website now: Family Classics: Every Family has a favorite recipe. What’s yours?
Here is a breakdown of the key features of the new website:
- Defined goals: Family Classics had one main goal: to get people to share their recipes, stories and photos. They also had 2 secondary goals: get people to sign up for their email updates and sell the Classic Creole cookbook.
- It’s responsive: No matter what device you use – smartphone, tablet or desktop – to view the website, the website will adjust to the size of your browser. No more pinching and zooming to try and figure out what that tiny text says. How does your own site look on a mobile phone?
- Easy to update website: The website is built in the Content Management System (CMS), WordPress, which is super easy to update. There is even a mobile app, where you can type in blog posts from anywhere. Turn those unproductive times like waiting to get your oil change, into blog time.
- Custom add recipe, story and photo upload section: This recipe website design also needed a place where users could enter their recipes, stories and photos. This section is also completely editable in the Admin section. See how we created this section here: Share your recipe
- Custom WordPress theme design: Each website I create, I present 2-3 website design options. For this site, I created a custom background that loads fast, along with a custom color scheme and header design.
- Tagline: Originally Ann just had a logo, but I came up with a few tagline ideas while designing the site to better explain what the website was all about. Her final choice: Every Family has a favorite recipe. What’s yours?
- Fonts: The fonts I picked out for this website are specifically picked to compliment the fonts of their existing Family Classics logo.
- Color Scheme: The color scheme that I chose was to compliment the logo colors and create the feeling of a cozy, warm family room.
- PDF instructions: I provided Family Classics with a PDF on how to update their WordPress website.
Does your website need a re-design, so its responsive and easier to update? Contact me at becca@bauerhaus.comBy C.L. Phillips
We sat in the living room, I at my grandmother's knee. We each held a mess of green beans plucked straight from the garden. Grandma said, "Let's clean up these beans while my story's on."
Over the course of ten summer visits to Grandma's house, I learned to care deeply about fictional characters. I shared their hopes, dreams, and despair. Every day, Grandma and I would do some type of chore that could be completed in front of the television while we peered into a world of rich business people, doctors, lawyers, heroes and villains. First for thirty minutes, and then later for a full hour, we rooted for our favorites.
Afterward, Grandma would editorialize about the day's show. "Lisa should know she can't trust that sneaky John Dixon. When will she learn?" And then she'd go off on a story from her life, drawing parallels between the real and fictional worlds. She told me, "Honey, you don't have to make every mistake in the world to learn from it, you just have to watch other people." Every day, she could take the main conflict and relate it directly to her life. You see, in our world, there were no rich business people, no lawyers or doctors. In our world, you didn't get dressed up to dig coal or potash. But we watched and I learned.
The first time I had to write a book report in elementary school, I didn't know what to do. Then I remembered how Grandma could always explain her story. She'd dig into the conflict immediately. She could always distill a show down into one simple sentence. It always started the same way. "Honey, the problem is somebody wants something they can't have." Is life really that simple? Sure worked for book reports.
One day, I squeezed into the middle seat on a crowded flight from St. Louis to Newark. The guy seated next to me asked, "What do you do?" I gave him a polite, yet evasive answer. "And what do you do?" I asked. "I'm a writer for a television show." Now I'm interested. "Which one?" I asked. Yep, you guessed it. As the World Turns. Can you see the look on the guy's face when he realized I was a certifiable fifteen year fan? Over the next several hours he shared how the show came together every day, every week, every month, and every season. Teams of people working together. A common goal. Shared accomplishment. "Boy, you must really love your job". His eyes traveled to some far away place. "It pays the bills," he said.
One of the great mysteries of being a writer, an author, is the knowledge you will touch lives you will never know personally. You will change the way people think, what they imagine, who they become. May you have the courage to create a world where you start a conversation with the quiet voice inside your reader.
======================:
C.L., are we related? I could swear you were talking about my grandma, right down to the mess of green beans.
I had lost touch with As the World Turns in recent years, but if felt like hearing a long lost friend had died to learn of its cancellation.
Remember when Lisa ran a book store?
Lovely post, C.L. My grandma was a Guiding Light fan.
No green beans, though--she had the ironing board set up in front of the TV.
When I talked about this subject on facebook I couldn't believe the response. Like yours, so many of us grew up watching ATWT with our grandmothers or our mothers, helping fold laundry, eating PBJs, and getting caught up in the Hughes family and life in Oakdale. It's sad that it had to come to an end.
My grandmother and GRANDFATHER watched As the World Turns. He would come home for dinner (that's what they called the noon meal). My grandfather owned an auto body shop and could set his own hours. My grandmother would time dinner so that they would finish just as "her story" was coming on. Then she would leave the dishes until afterward. My grandfather would take a nap on the sofa while As the World Turns aired. But - I don't think he really napped. He could tell you the plot just as well as my grandmother. We were watching As the World Turns when it was interrupted for the announcment that John F. Kennedy had been shot in Dallas. I was only five then, but I remember it very clearly. I knew it had to be a horrible event since it was interrupting my grandmother's show.
Very sad to see the end of this soap. Another thing from my childhood gone.

My inspriation was the movie and TV show M*A*S*H. I watched it every week. I even scheduled my evening college classes around it.
These days, even though it's on sporatically as a rerun, I bought the entire 11 year series on DVD. Now I can watch it when I feel like it. Back then I felt, and still feel, like any writer that could make me laugh and cry within the confines of a program was a success. That's been my guideline in my writing.
Sisters! So glad to meet women who know my life from 'mess of green beans' to 'ATWT.' I was born and raised in Atlanta, but spent Sundays and part of the summer with my grandmother in my mom's home town of Porterdale, GA. It was a cotton mill town, and my grandmother's house was next door to my great grandmother, whose never-wed son and daughter lived with her. Everyday Mae Mae, Forris, and Robbie came home from the mill for lunch and watched Guiding Light and As The World Turns. I'll always remember my mother talking about Lisa "If i was to see that hussy on the street, I believe I'd just slap her."
Now that's powerful writing.
It still amazes me how soaps bring folks together. My mom, too, called ATWT one of "her stories". In fact, she named me after a soap character! Hey, remember Meg Ryan as Betsy???
We also watched Guiding Light (hmmm... maybe that's when my love of lighthouses began?) and to some extent, The Young and the Restless.
I mourned when GL left the airwaves. Thanks for the memories!
PamSometimes old demons become new again. Dallas star Ken Kercheval found this out the hard way on December 27th. The 77-year old actor showed up for a chat on London’s morning Breakfast show and with just a few minutes to go before air time, producers realized that Ken was most definitely sloshed. The actor was slurring and unsteady on his feet. He was in great spirits according to the latest GLOBE print edition. The problem was that he was so drunk that nothing that he said even remotely resembled the English language and eventually producers convinced the star to go and sleep it off.
Apparently Breakfast had been anxious to have him live because Ken was starring in a Christmas stage show over the Christmas holiday in Manchester. Instead they got an aging actor that was just a little too spirited for morning television audience.
Ken has had a long running battle with alcoholism with various tumbles off the wagon here and there. He appears to be one of those people that gets it together but simply can’t keep it that way. His character, Cliff Barnes, has been an integral part of the rebooted Dallas. His character has always been closely connected to Larry Hangman’s JR Ewing so you have to wonder what the shows powers-that-be have in store for him. Plus if the actor isn’t sober and can’t show up and do his job as a professional then it’ll be interesting to see if Cliff Barnes is simply phased out, at least for awhile.
Do you think this was just a stupid slip on Ken’s part or is he drinking heavily again? Is another rehab trip in the actors future? Tell us your thoughts in the comments below! Is Dallas one of your fave shows? What should be done to stop all this Ken Kercheval drunk behavior?

Quoting daughteroftruth:
How long does storms like this usually shut things down? Do they shut roads down for ice?
Quoting FoxFire363:
Well, for one, there are the people who don't know how to drive in it. Then there is the issue that in some cases even major metropolitan areas aren't prepared to properly sand and salt the roads, much less all the small towns and smaller cities. A few years ago we got 13 inches of snow and it shut the city down because they simply didn't have enough plows. Yesterday we had ice and there were tons of wrecks between the drivers and lack of salt/sand. This year our supplies of those items were depleted due to vandalism which added to the issue.
Quoting daughteroftruth:
What kind of problems does it cause? Its just something that we are so used to that really we don't even blink an eye when we get ice storms or snow. Is it that just most people down there don't know how to drive in the conditions?
Quoting Okie-chick:
For Texas and that area,yes lol

This isn't meant to be rude.. but 2 inches of ice and snow is a big deal?Advances in Joint Surgery Anesthesia Provide Preemptive Pain Control
New techniques help stop joint surgery pain before it starts.
Not too many years ago, having joint replacement usually meant general anesthesia for surgery followed by grogginess and the need for strong narcotic pain-relievers afterwards. But now many surgeons are turning to newer regional and local anesthesia techniques when performing joint replacements, as research and experience are showing their benefits both during surgery and in recovery and rehabilitation afterwards., vice president of business development and former chief of staff at Norwalk Hospital in Norwalk, Conn.
In a spinal block, the doctor injects an analgesic into the fluid surrounding the spinal cord in the lower back to produce an effect that can last for up to several hours. In an epidural block, the anesthetic is delivered to the epidural space – the outermost part of the spinal canal – through a catheter, which is left in place during surgery for the administration of pain medication.
Newer methods of anesthesia, often used along with spinal or epidural blocks – or in some cases with general anesthesia – include regional nerve blocks, which involve applying an anesthetic directly to the nerves (most commonly the femoral nerve for the knee and the brachial plexus for the shoulder) that supply the joint, and local infiltration, the administration of an anesthetic to the soft issues of the joint itself, are able to see under the skin and see the arteries, veins, nerves, muscle and tissue,“ he says. “While we were doing it with other techniques prior to that, to actually visualize and see the nerve and put the medication right there where you can see it gives you a much higher success rate.”
When longer relief is needed, the surgeon may place a tiny catheter next to the nerve and connect it to a pump to administer an anesthetic for up to three days after surgery. “What you get is a way to extend the anesthesia or the numbing effect of the local anesthetic longer than the chemistry of just doing a single shot, making people more comfortable in the first painful days after surgery,” he says.
Some research suggests that people who have regional and local anesthesia experience less pain than those who have general anesthesia only, because they provide preemptive pain control – in essence, they stop pain before it starts, says Dr. Konowitz. “There is all sorts, such as that newer techniques may also offer these other direct or indirect benefits over general anesthesia:
Less need for narcotic analgesics. For people, who have had joint surgery, the use of narcotics for post-surgical pain relief can cause a number of unwanted side effects, including grogginess, nausea and vomiting. In a recent review of 10 studies of femoral nerve blocks for total knee replacement published in the journal Anesthesiology, use of the blocks was found to reduce narcotic consumption and get up and walk earlier that alone reduces lung problems and breathing issues and the development of other problems, because they can get up and get around and get vertical and start moving,” says Dr. Hopkinson. “The quicker you walk the less likely you are to get a blood clot.”
Quicker recovery time. When a joint is painful after surgery, it’s natural to resist moving it, particularly if using epidural blocks, regional nerve blocks and local analgesics together,.
Researchers are continuing to study the benefits or regional and local analgesia as well as ways to improve upon it. This includes improving the regional nerve blocks for hips, which have been less successful than those for the shoulder and knee, as well as finding the doses and placement of anesthetics to provide optimal pain relief while still enabling patients to move.
“The pain fibers are small land the motor fibers are bigger, so theoretically you could [adjust anesthetic levels] to block the pain fibers and keep the motor fibers working,” says Dr. Hopkinson. “There is research on better ways to do that.”
For now, doctors recommend joint replacement patients speak with their surgeon before surgery to discuss pain-relief options, including whether their anesthesiologists use regional nerve blocks and/or local infiltration as well as their experience with those newer methods.
The goal, Dr. Konowitz, is not only to improve joint outcome, but to make the process of getting there easier. “When you look at how you can help someone have a better surgical experience, aside from giving you a good joint replacement, x-rays and pictures, it’s how you get that result.”XY Manga.

The deal gave the Saints the seventh pick in the ’68 draft. They had lost their first round choice as compensation to the Packers for signing FB Jim Taylor as a free agent in ‘67. Meanwhile, Minnesota still held the first overall pick thanks to their trade with New York the previous year involving QB Fran Tarkenton. It was widely speculated that they would take a lineman with that first choice, and so they did, choosing USC tackle Ron Yary, who would go on to a Hall of Fame career.
Cuozzo was 27 years old and had played collegiately at the University of Virginia, where he had also been a Phi Beta Kappa student. He signed with the Baltimore Colts as an undrafted free agent in 1963 and backed up all-time great QB Johnny Unitas for four years, drawing attention when Unitas was injured during the ’65 season. Cuozzo performed capably in relief – in particular, a five-TD passing performance against the Vikings – before he also went down with a shoulder separation.
So highly was he regarded that the expansion Saints acquired him from the Colts in 1967 for first and third draft choices plus C Bill Curry. However, he proved to be a poor fit as an immobile quarterback on a weak first-year club and was unable to hold on to the starting job. He completed 51.5 percent of his passes for 1562 yards, averaging just 6.0 yards per attempt, with seven touchdowns against 12 interceptions.
“We feel Gary will upgrade our offensive team,” said Minnesota GM Jim Finks. “If he can execute the forward pass like he has done in the past, he will help our offensive team considerably.”
“Gary has been in the league for five years. It’s time for him to assert himself,” was the challenge put forth by second-year Head Coach Bud Grant.
Finks declined comment on how the trade would affect the status of the three quarterbacks already on the roster, including starter Joe Kapp plus Ron VanderKelen and Bob Berry. The position had been at issue since Tarkenton was traded away. VanderKelen, the long-time apprentice, failed in the early going in 1967 and 29-year-old Joe Kapp, an eight-year veteran of the CFL, was signed to take over the starting job. With his fiery leadership to compensate for a lack of pure passing skill, Kapp did a creditable job – especially considering he had not had the benefit of a training camp with his new team. Minnesota scored just 11 touchdowns through the air in ’67.
With some good running backs and a promising group of receivers – not to mention an up-and-coming defense – it was widely believed that obtaining a solid quarterback could make the Vikings a contender in the NFL Central, and that Cuozzo would most likely land the starting job.
In fact, it was Kapp starting for the Vikings in 1968 and ’69 as they won the first two division titles in franchise history and the NFL Championship in the second year – although they fell short against the Chiefs in the last pre-merger Super Bowl. But the 1969 season proved to be the last for Kapp in a Minnesota uniform – a contract dispute led to his holding out in ’70 and he was dealt to the Patriots.
Cuozzo was finally the starting quarterback for the Vikings in his third season with the club. The team went 12-2 to again top its division (now the NFC Central) but it was the strong defense, not the offense, leading the way. Cuozzo was the conference’s tenth-ranked passer, completing 128 of his 257 throws (49.8 %) for 1720 yards with just seven touchdowns against 10 interceptions, averaging 6.7 yards per attempt and 13.4 yards per completion - only the last number ranked in the league’s top 10. Moreover, Minnesota lost in the Divisional playoff round to the 49ers in a home game in which he performed poorly.
In the offseason, the Vikings swung a trade with the Eagles for ten-year veteran QB Norm Snead. Cuozzo ended up starting most of Minnesota’s games in 1971, with young Bob Lee also in the mix along with Snead. Once again the Vikings topped their division with a fine 11-3 tally, and once again they were quickly dispatched in the postseason.
The Vikings dealt both Cuozzo and Snead in the offseason. Snead went to the Giants for Fran Tarkenton, the quarterback whose departure following the 1966 season had first set off the process of finding a capable replacement. Cuozzo was traded to the St. Louis Cardinals for WR John Gilliam and a second-round draft choice. Competing with Jim Hart and Tim Van Galder in St. Louis, Cuozzo started six games in his final year in the NFL.
An intelligent player and accurate passer, he had neither the arm strength nor leadership ability to succeed consistently as a starting quarterback in the NFL despite being highly sought after. He started a total of 40 games and had a record of 21-19 while completing just under half of his passes (49.4 %) for 7402 yards and 43 touchdowns along with 55 interceptions. His postseason performances were no better.
As a footnote, the two first-round draft choices that the Saints received for Cuozzo were used to take Kevin Hardy, a defensive end out of Notre Dame, in 1968 and Xavier guard John Shinners in ’69. Hardy never played for New Orleans, being awarded during the summer to the 49ers along with a 1969 first-round pick as compensation for the signing of free agent WR Dave Parks. He lasted one season in San Francisco and played as a backup for the Packers and Chargers before his disappointing career ended in 1972. Shinners did play with New Orleans for three years before moving on to the Colts for a year and then Cincinnati for five undistinguished seasons.- _mean (Welcome to twitter follow:>)

The first-ever JunqueFest was held at Wilson Brewer Historic Park in Webster City. More than 50 vendors of antiques and repurposed items set up shop on the lawn of the Depot Museum at the intersection of Superior and Ohio Streets.
"We had well over 500 people Friday night which is good for the first night of any new event. Today (Saturday), there have been well over a thousand people here and it's only two and half hours into it," said Mike Constant, who created the Iowa Antique Network and is one of several JunqueFest organizers. According to social media posts, organizers estimated more than 3,000 attended the event throughout the weekend.
Trudy Anderson, left, who operates TADA with her husband, Don, writes up sales ticket for a customer on Saturday. The Andersons took part in JunqueFest in Webster City, a three-day event.
Constant said there will likely be a JunqueFest next year as well.
Vendors for the event came from as far as Omaha and as near as Webster City, Fort Dodge and Stratford.
Don and Trudy Anderson of rural Webster City, were among the local enterprises to set up a booth for JunqueFest. Their business, TADA, offered customers a diverse selection of wooden pieces, metal and vintage items.
"Unfortunately, I love to go to auctions. If you go to auctions, you have to have a way to get rid of some of it because you always acquire too much," Don Anderson said.
Anderson said he and his wife for years have been interested in repurposing materials. When the couple built their home, they used items salvaged from the old Webster City Middle School and the Stratford School. The retired music teacher said their interests and business seem to mesh well with current junk decorating trend.
"With this craze of chipping paint, it just seemed sort natural for us," he said.
Holly Mortenson was among the shoppers on Saturday morning. She said she was enjoying the nice weather and interesting items on display.
"The organizers really deserve a pat on the back for this event. Having this many vendors is really great," Mortenson said.
She admitted that she had found a few treasures as she browsed the booths.
"Not that my husband needs to know, but I found a few bargains," she said.
Artist Michael Drake of Fort Dodge demonstrated his unique style of painting during JunqueFest. Drake creates free-style spray cant art.
He discovered spray can art videos on YouTube and decided to try his hand at it.
"This is my third season doing this," he said. Drake drew crowds as he designed and created landscapes and abstract pieces throughout the weekend.
In addition to the junk and antiques vendors, visitors had the chance to sample food from local restaurants and to sample wine from two Iowa wineries.

Pitchfork has praised Lianne La Havas' new album Blood, giving it a 7.7 review in advance of its release last week. In her review, Hannah Georgis writes, "La Havas may be young, but her voice marries youthful lightness with a gravitas most often ascribed to artists well beyond her 25 years." According to Georgis, "La Havas is always in motion," as evidenced by the genre switching on an album that nonetheless has an "almost seamless" flow. Check out the review here to find out how Blood updates the sound of her 2012 iTunes UK Album of the Year debut, Is Your Love Big Enough?
La Havas' rise, which began with that Mercury Prize-nominated record, gained momentum through collaborations with the likes of Prince and Alt-J, and continues with the early praise heaped upon Blood, seems "Unstoppable." That's the name of Blood's lead track, the video for which Stereogum premiered in May. "Lianne La Havas is so mesmerizing that she can dance alone in a room for four minutes and still leave you feeling spellbound," writes the site's Caitlin White about the clip, which can be viewed here.MarQ Spekt Songs

Just heard this fantastic news on the radio. After so long with no news this is brilliant. Small steps. :)Juna Babb and Michael Babb confessed to holding an African cook hostage for two years.
Slavery was not over in the home of Michael and Juna Babb.
On Friday the Ellenwood, Georgia, couple pleaded guilty in federal court to felony charges related to a labor scheme involving a young woman from the Kingdom of Swaziland in Southern Africa that was in fact human trafficking.
The victim, in her 20s, was asked to cook at Juna Gwendolyn Babb’s wedding by Babb during a visit to Swaziland. Accepting the offer, the two headed to the United States. Upon arrival, however, the unnamed victim was in for a surprise. There was no wedding. Instead, the Swaziland cook was forced to work as a housekeeper for almost two years for little to no pay.
“Few crimes are more shocking than the trafficking of human beings in this country,” said Brock Nicholson, a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement special agent. “No one should have to live in a world of isolation and forced servitude.”
Babb’s husband, Michael Babb, a minister, knew of the wrongdoing taking place in his home, but failed to notify authorities. He even lied to FBI special agents when asked if the victim worked as the housekeeper.
“This young woman believed that she was only traveling to the United States for a brief visit to help with a wedding,” said U.S. Attorney Sally Quillian Yates. “Instead, she was compelled to labor for the defendants for more than two years. It is especially disturbing that the victim was exploited by a minister and his wife.”
Juna Babb pleaded guilty to harboring an alien for financial gain and Michael Babb pleaded guilty to misprision of “a felony for concealing his wife’s criminal conduct and for lying to federal agents,” reports the Department of Justice.
Both defendants will pay $25,000 in restitution for the victim’s unpaid labor. Juna Babb could spend up to 10 years in prison and Michael Babb up to three.

Janet Sheridan: 40 years later
A shadow hovered over the United States in the early '60s. Its darkness lurked in the background as I married and graduated from college; it fell across the school where I taught fourth-grade children the intricacies of long division, comprehension skills of reading, and correct fingering for their flute-o-phones. Busy with my life, I didn’t notice the shadow blacken, move closer, threaten. I didn’t know it would envelope me.
Janet Sheridan: A reluctant fan
First, my older brothers brainwashed me, then the speed and athleticism of the players and the changing rhythms of the game hooked me. I became a college basketball fan. Football caught my attention when I attended Utah State shortly after the glory days of Merlin Olsen. A knowledgeable guide in the person of my college boyfriend cemented my enjoyment of a game played by strong, quick athletes who mix it up, emerge battered and dirty, and come back the next week to do it again.

That was true last week when the Giants started center Jim Cordle and right guard James Brewer, who made their first and second career starts, respectively. Possibly in line for another start on Sunday against the Philadelphia Eagles, Cordle knew the expectations going into the Week 4 loss on the road to the Kansas City Chiefs.
“We didn’t hold up to how we expected,” Cordle said Thursday. “But as players, sometimes we read some things, and it seemed like the expectation was very low. So we could only beat expectations…but [Tom] Coughlin said it was ‘OK.’ But we’ll get better.”
>> INFORGRAPHIC: GIANTS VS. EAGLES
The head coach echoed those sentiments the day after the game.
“Those two guys [Cordle and Brewer] that everybody speculated about, they did OK,” OK.”
But “OK” has to be “better” in order for the Giants to get their first win.
They will attempt to do so without veterans David Baas (neck) and Chris Snee (hip), whom Cordle and Brewer filled in for. Baas and Snee have yet to return to the practice field. But longtime Giant David Diehl returned to practice and is slotted at right guard.
None of this is set in stone as Coughlin gave his usual “we’ll see” response today, but if the rest remains the same, Cordle will be at center again on Sunday.
This time it will be in front of an offense-friendly home crowd at MetLife Stadium.
“I wasn’t nervous, but I knew it was going to be a challenge,” Cordle said of making his first career start last week. “I knew it was going to be such a challenge that I think I just kind of focused in and -- ‘This is what we have to do.’ Arrowhead [Stadium] was loud. There were a lot of things, but I was just, hey, I’ve been here a long time, I’m ready to play and help. The result wasn’t what we wanted, but I did feel comfortable with everything going on.”
>> LATEST GIANTS-EAGLES INJURY REPORT
But it wasn’t as boisterous as the man now to his right.
“[Diehl is] a loud guy, so he’s always talking, which is good,” Cordle said. “He’s always communicating before the play, during the play, after the play. So I think it’s going to help us…We can pick it up, and he knows what he’s doing and he knows what I’m supposed to do. So he’ll help us with his vocals.”Simplicity 2.0

Again, to avoid misunderstandigs, I am in full favour of networks. We use them heavily ourselves. But, as long as we stay local/campus/national, we don't need to go _inter_national.

Richard Farnell has made the proposals that are in the early stages
On-the-spot fines or simply removing those deemed guilty of foul and abusive language from the town centre has been proposed in a wide-ranging crackdown on anti-social behaviour by Rochdale Borough Council.
The proposal has been called a “staggering misuse of power” that would “unjustifiably curb the rights and freedoms of Rochdale residents” according to the human rights group, Liberty.
Council chiefs want a Public Space Protection Order which could see anyone caught “using foul and abusive language” being fined or moved on, to create a family environment.
Richard Farnell, the council leader, said: “There have been instances, particularly with people who have been drinking, who have been shouting and swearing aggressively at shoppers.

Audio interview by GAO staff with A. Nikki Clowers, Director, Financial Markets and Community InvestmentNorwegian national team goalkeeper Katrine Lunde Haraldsen will be leaving reigning Champions League winners Viborg HK after this season.
The 29 year old keeper, who played an important part in Viborg winning the Champions League last year, will be joining Viborg’s opponents in the CL finals last season, Hungarian champions Györi AUDI ETO KC.
For some time it has been known that Viborg and Lunde Haraldsen could not reach an agreement on an extension of her contract with the Danes, and ever since those negotiations ended without a result, has she been looking for a new club. Now she has succeeded.
"I was visiting the club and I got a very good impression of the club, the coach and the leaders in the club. They really had the passion and I appreciate that. I look forward to play for one of the best teams in the world. It’s rather exiting for me and my husband to go to Györ, including and a big challenge with a new culture - but it will be nice. I also look forward to play together with the world class keeper - Katalin Palinger," Katrine Lunde Haraldsen said.
Attila Vanyus, the President of Györi Audi ETO, said: "That we can have her is a huge result that symbolizes the standing of our club in the handball world. I really hope that her mentality brings in a brand new dimension, and thatour young players can learn a lot from her attitude."
Lunde Haraldsen has been with Viborg since the summer of 2007. The club is still looking for a successor.

The call came in to officers at 10:15 a.m. from people using the park’s jogging path, according to Capt. Martin Baeza Los Angeles Police Department.
“There is in fact a body floating in the lake here at Hollenbeck Park,” Baeza said. “It’s an ongoing investigation. We haven’t been able to determine at this point what the circumstances are as to the body.”
The body’s gender was not initially known, Baeza said. Homicide detectives were on scene and were treating the discovery as a crime, he said.
The victim was a female Hispanic, LAPD Officer Nuria Vanegas said on Thursday afternoon. She said the case was “ruled” a homicide.
An LAPD underwater dive unit was on scene, Baeza said, and divers could be seen working in the water and later pulling the body ashore under a yellow tarp.
The park is just east of downtown Los Angeles, at Fourth and St. Louis streets (map) in a largely residential area.
There have been homeless encampments at the park from time to time but there had not been “issues of note” in the area recently, Baeza said.

Euan has been an immense help in motivating me to a new exercise regime. His approach was one of great understanding and encouragement and I would thoroughly recommend his services.

With my wedding just around the corner I decided to hit the gym to get into shape. Having always started at the gym and never following through I thought I'd give personal training a try. Euan was the first call I made and after a very friendly meeting we hit the gym. Our first session was brilliant; we assessed my fitness and did some crcuits.
Over the next 3 months I did two blocks of 12 sessions and am currently in the best shape of my life. As well as very enjoyable PT sessions Euan also gave me a programme to do on my own which progressed as the weeks passed. As well as cardio we als did free weight work (which I was a complete novice at) and high impact sessions.
Euan's laid back and friendly approach has given me the confidence to go to the gym and enjoy it. I highly recommend Euan.

I have had a Personal Trainer for several weeks now and do it with Focus Personal training. I do my training every Wednesday at Drumbrae Leisure Centre.
A typical day will consist of using the cross trainer, treadmill, weights and floor exercises. Starting with the treadmill I do 10 minutes warm up before we start. My current speed is 5kph. before i started with my Personal Trainer I was doing between 3-4kph. I also do step exercises now, something that i didn't really bother with before I had my own Personal Trainer. I exercise using balls of various weights, swiss ball, wall press ups, squats and squeezing the swiss ball as hard as I can.
I have also used the power plate for the first time, something that I would not have done on my own. Ok, getting a Personal trainer isn't cheap but they are patient and if I have an off day I can just tell him. My personal trainer makes exercising fun and it is now the highlight of my week. I have a personal programme that he helped me come up with. Working with a personal trainer is both challenging and work, but to date I have lost a large amount of weight and I feel much better and healthier for it. In between the times with my personal trainer, I also go swimming.
So if you find yourself anywhere near the gym at the Drumbrae Leisure centre come on in and say hi. It's the best decision I Made.

Geosynthetic structures of the invention are ideal for providing subsurface drainage for roadways and other large structures such as parking lots, retaining walls and buildings.
The building of large structures such as roadways, buildings, parking lots, retaining walls, embankments and the like often involves the excavation, re-contouring and other movement of large quantities of earthen materials such as soil, rock, earth, gravel, sand and the like. Most large structures have underlying foundations of some sort to support the weight of the structure and thereby stabilize the structure in its desired position with respect to the earth and with respect to other parts of the same structure. For example, roadways and parking lots usually have foundations comprising a base aggregate immediately under the paved surface, and a subgrade layer under the base aggregate which supports the weight of both of the overlying structures. Commonly, both the base and subgrade are formed of stones, soil and other earthen materials and subjected repeatedly to grading, tamping or other compaction operations and thereby formed into a foundation of desired density, elevation, inclination and direction. Buildings commonly have concrete foundations or concrete slabs that support the weight of the overlying structure.
The presence of water or other fluids near, within or under such foundations can be quite disadvantageous. For example, water or other fluids in the foundation materials underlying such structures can cause hydraulic pore pressure buildup and reduction in the effective stress in the soil materials. These conditions can directly or indirectly contribute to failure of the underlying materials that support the overlying foundation and can thereby also cause a failure of the overlying structure. It is thus important to positively control the water or other fluids and dissipate pore pressure underlying large structures and in the vicinity of and underlying the foundations of such large structures.
The movement of soil particles around and underlying structures is not limited to that caused by the presence of fluids. Movement can occur from repeated or repetitive dynamic loads, as well as static loads that cause destabilizing stresses within the soil structure. One way of controlling such movement is to provide reinforcing products such as frameworks which are integral to the materials underlying the foundation, or within it, to thereby prevent or impede such undesired movement. Geosynthetics are materials often used to provide such a framework. The use of geosynthetics contributes to controlling movement of soil particles and structural fill materials in four primary ways:
1) By creating higher degrees of friction between the natural materials and the surface of the geosynthetic when compared to the frictional characteristics of the soil itself in order to minimize soil movement in horizontal, vertical and diagonal directions.
2) By confining soil fill material within the geosynthetic structure in an attempt to control lateral movement of soil particles.
3) By providing a nonporous, impermeable membrane type barrier that minimizes vertical migration of soil particles and fluids. At times, horizontal and diagonal movement of soil particles is impeded by roughening or texturing the geosynthetic in order to increase the friction between the soil and the geosynthetic.
4) By providing a semiporous, porous, or permeable barrier that minimizes vertical migration of soil particles by not allowing soil particles to move through openings in the geosynthetic that are effectively smaller than the diameter of the soil particles themselves, while also allowing fluids to migrate vertically, diagonally and horizontally irrespective of gravity through one or more layers of a single or multi-ply geosynthetic.
These porous, semiporporous or permeable geosynthetics allow fluids to pass vertically and horizontally through their structures. Capillary connections sometimes occur and are one aspect that allow fluids to migrate vertically and diagonally irrespective of gravity through multi-ply geosynthetics. Capillary connections are created by the contacting of two or more plys of geosynthetics and provide continuous vertical or diagonal capillary paths through which fluids may travel. Typically, capillary connections may appear in a semi-continuous pattern across the horizontal plane of a geosynthetic comprising more than one ply. These connections, which are formed when the polymer strands of one ply of a geosynthetic contact the polymer strands of another ply often occur when layers of geosynthetics are arranged or constructed to allow one ply to be placed directly on top of another ply. Polymer strands of individual geosynthetic plys assist fluid migration in the horizontal plane of the specific geosynthetic ply. This horizontal transmission of fluid can be expressed as a rate of flow per unit width within the plane of a geosynthetic and is typically called “transmissivity.” On the other hand, the vertical transmission rate of fluid, or “permittivity” of a geosynthetic is typically expressed by measuring the rate of flow per unit area per unit thickness. Permitivity is a quantifiable property that can be controlled during the maufacturering process.
Vertical and diagonal capillary connections can be created even when two or more plys of geosynthetic are arranged in substantially but parallel planes when polymer strands of one ply become in contact with the polymer strands of another ply. This can occur under the normal pressures that are placed upon the geosynthetic from the overlying soil burden which forces polymeric strands of the separate plys together thereby allowing fluids to migrate against gravity at the sites of the continuous capillary connections. The flow of fluids through a geosynthetic against gravity is often referred to as “wicking,” and is distinguished from permitivity. Wicking occurs after field installation of the product and is not a predictably quantifiable characteristic of the system but is dependent on a number of different factors. Wicking, the fluid transmission against gravity resulting from capillary connections created by the deformation and intercontact of geosynethic plys, is a property that is sometimes advantageous and other times disadvantageous.For example, in applications where the user desires water to be transmitted against gravity these, capillary connections may provide a benefit. In contrast, using geosynthetics in applications where the user does not want fluid to pass via the mechanism provided by the capillary connection can be a detriment to the particular structure.
In general, geosynthetics are manufactured as substantially planar, or sheetlike, products from polymeric materials. Geosynthetics are usually made in large scale, for example, several meters in width and many meters in length so that they are easily adaptable to large scale construction and landscaping uses. Some geosynthetics are flexible or fabric-like and therefore conform easily to uneven or rolling surfaces. Some geosynthetics are manufactured to be less flexible but to possess great tensile strength and resistance to stretching or great resistance to compression. Certain types of geosynthetic materials are used to reinforce large man-made structures, particularly those made of earthen materials such as gravel, sand and soil. In such uses, one purpose of using the geosynthetic is that of holding the earthen components together by providing a latticework or meshwork whose elements have a high resistence to stretching. By positioning the geosynthetic integral to the gravel, sand and soil, that is, with the gravel, sand and soil within the interstices of the geosynthetic, unwanted movement of the earthen components is minimized or eliminated. Most geosynthetic materials, whether of the latticework type or of the fabric type, allow water to pass through them to some extent and into the material within which the geosynthetic is integrally positioned. Thus, geosynthetic materials and related geotechnical engineering materials are used as integral parts of man-made structures or systems in order to stabilize their salient dimensions.
A particular problem faced by the FHWA, the DOT and many highway and transportation agencies across the United States and elsewhere is the high-cost and difficult maintenance of state and interstate roadways. A significant cause of this high cost and these difficulties is the entrapment and retention of water and other fluids which damage roadways and greatly reduce their useful life. This is the case even on those projects where conventional geosynthetics are used. Water in pavement systems that are inclusive or exclusive of geosynthetic is one of the principal causes of pavement distress. Fluid such as water enters the subsurface either from the subgrade soil, that is, the native ground upon which the roadway is constructed, or from rainwater or floodwater penetrating open spaces such as cracks and pits within the road surface. Under common usage, vehicular traffic across the roadway produces a dynamic or repetitious loading force on the road that creates a “pumping action” that draws fluid through the subgrade into the subbase or base coarse of the road. When this fluid is retained within the subbase or road base, damage to the roadway occurs. As indicated in the AASHTO design methodology (1993), drainage performance can range from excellent (water is removed from the roadway systems within two hours) to poor drainage (water is removed within one month). The corresponding drainage coefficient (direct design parameter) for an excellent drainage is 3.0 times greater then the corresponding drainage coefficient for poor drainage. The higher drainage coefficient increases the structural number. Therefore, the service life of the structures can be extended or the overall structural cross-section can be reduced. When there is a high fluid content within the soil supporting the traffic lanes, reduced bearing capacity can occur, resulting in deformation of the contour of the road, wheel rutting, and premature collapse or failure of the roadway.
Another drainage issue particular to construction of roadways and other large structures in regions with cold climates relates to frost damage to pavements due to frost heaving and subsequent thawing. Frost heaving, the raising of the pavement surface occurs due to the formation of ice lenses, which can grow up to several centimeters in the thickness, in the underlying soil. Differential frost heaving leads to adverse pavement roughness and hazardous driving conditions. Thawing or frozen pavements in frost-melting periods causes a supersaturated soil condition. If the drainage provisions are inadequate, the bearing capacity of the pavement is substantially reduced, which in turn causes bearing capacity failure or surface cracking. Traffic loading during the thaw season can also pump fine-grained subgrade soils into the subbase or base course. Among the economic losses by frost damage are costs of repair and maintenance, possible restrictions of vehicle weight-limits or even complete closure of the traffic. All of these conditions can be extremely costly. To reduce damage caused by frost heaving, in 1963 the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers suggested two strategies: 1)the control of surface deformation resulting from frost action by limiting the amount of frost-susceptible soil subjected to freezing temperatures; and 2) employing designs of adequately large bearing capacities sufficient to withstand stresses experienced during the most critical climatic period. This means a significant increase in aggregate thickness and the concomitant increase in cost and time required to construct a given structure.
Design methods based on the above two concepts call for the use of clean, nonfrost-susceptible base material. Such material is becoming more and more expensive to obtain and transport. Due to the required serviceability that an engineer must account for in the design for their clients, these types of expensive soils are often forced to be considered in civil engineering projects, thus making demand for them higher and, consequently, an increase in their prices.
Frost damage can be reduced by introducing a capillary break, or water barrier, to reduce water migration into the freezing front. Various methods are known to deal with this problem. For example, Finland and Sweden have used a layer or sand to break the capillary connection between frost-susceptible soils (Rengmark, 1963; Taivenen, 1963). This insulating layer of sand was found to help reduce and smooth frost heave, and also to increase the bearing capacity during the spring thaw.
Before the present invention, previous drainage systems using geosynthetic structures are exclusively limited to providing drainage at the edge or shoulder of a roadway. These edge-drain systems are commonly located within a covered trench originally dug along the shoulder of the roadway, in an area which receives little or no dynamic load from the roadway. Usually serving a dual purpose, the edge-drain relies upon natural drainage from directly beneath the road surface within the subbase or subgrade to carry fluid to the edge-drains for collection and further distribution, for example, by way of a shoulder pipe. The material of the subbase or subgrade acts also as a filter to prevent adjacent soil from clogging the drainage system. The drainage system directly beneath the surface of a roadway is often made of unstabilized granular, asphalt stabilized granular, or cement stabilized aggregate material. Such “natural material” drainage systems, if installed properly, can be used to carry large amounts of fluid from the subbase to the edge-drain.
There are many disadvantages to natural material drainage systems, however. Such systems require the subsurface aggregate to possess a uniform size gradation to provide void spaces, that is, interconnecting holes within the drainable base to carry fluid. Disadvantageously, the requirement for interconnecting void spaces to afford good drainage conflicts with road pavement systems designed for long-term use. This is so because roadways designed for long-term use require minimal void spaces in order to reduce the movement of particles, sand and aggregate. Free-draining aggregate usually require an asphaltic or cement stabilize binder to facilitate construction. Additionally, a well-graded granular or geotextile filter layer is needed to prevent contamination of the open graded base through the migration of subgrade fines. This extra filter layer further increases the cost of the roadway construction. Furthermore, high construction costs are incurred for a complete drainage layer of natural stone or sand that must be installed with precision, and extensive on-site quality control must be exercised, in order to produce a high-flow draining system which lasts for the life of the overlying paved surface.
When positioned directly beneath the road surface, conventional geosynthetic structures are primarily used to provide reinforcement of the base, subgrade stabilization, subgrade restraint, separation of the base course from the subgrade, or as a thermal break to provide insulation from temperature changes. Until the present invention, however, geosynthetic materials had not been designed or implemented to provide a positive drainage system effective enough to provide adequate drainage for an entire roadway or for an entire roadway portion. Similarly, until the present invention, no geosynthetic material had ever been designed to break the capillary connection that can occur as a result of the repeated dynamic traffic loads that can cause a capillary connection between different plys of geosynthetics, nor has a geosynthetic ever been used to provide a void maintaining system for the entire design life of a roadway and thereby serve as an effective capillary break to prevent moisture migration into the base course layer or into the frost susceptible soil layer, or underneath an entire roadway.
There is therefore a need for a drainage system that can be positioned within a large structure and provide efficient and cost-effective drainage for the structure while also providing a capillary break by utilizing components which can be engineered and manufactured offsite.
The present invention overcomes the previously mentioned disadvantages by providing a drainage system which provides interconnected drainage voids and also functions as a capillary break under substantial portions of the ground underlying roadways, parking lots, retaining walls, buildings and other large structures. Structures of the present invention are unitary void-maintaining geocomposite structures (to be sold under the trademark “UVMG”) UVMG's according to the invention can be constructed and positioned within one or more of the subsurface levels at predetermined locations under a large structure such as a roadway or building. The present UVMG's typically comprise a void-maintaining core such as a geonet adjacent to one or more layers of fluid-transmissable geotextile fabric. The structures are unitary in that the core element is preferably manufactured simultaneously with its filtration medium to form a unitary geocomposite. Another method of manufacture is for the core element and geotextile elements to be formed separately and then adhered to one another by heat, laser or electron beam welding, or by means of adhesives applied to one or more of the components to thereby form a unitary structure in advance of installation of the UVMG at a desired site.
The permittivity of a material relates to its ability to permit gases, water and other fluids to pass vertically, or substantially vertically, through the material. The fluid-transmissible layers of the present invention provide high permittivity of subsurface fluids such as water into the core element. Geotextiles are preferred as the fluid-transmissible layers of the invention. Other materials possessing high permittivity and high occlusiveness to solids are also suitable for the present invention. Structures of the present invention also possess high transmissivity. The transmissivity of a material relates to its ability to transmit gases, water or other fluids horizontally, or substantially horizontally, in a particular or desired direction. Typically, permittivity is measured as the rate of flow per unit area per unit width while transmissivity is measured in terms of rate of flow per unit width. Core elements of the present invention possess high transmissivity because of their interconnecting openings, which permit fluids to flow substantially horizontally away from the overlying or underlying structure. Thus, UVMG's eliminate many of the problems presented by the presence or movement of fluids such as water in the areas underlying large structures. By eliminating these problems, the useful life of the subject structure is extended.
The present invention relates generally to unitary void-maintaining geocomposite structures and systems for water drainage, and more particularly to such geocomposite structures combined with additional drainage elements such as pipes, conduits, edge drains, culverts and ditches for the subsurface drainage of roadways and other large structures such as parking lots, retaining walls and buildings.
A principal object of the present UVMG invention is to provide a subsurface drainage system that, among other things, provides a capillary break to thereby prevent unwanted movement of the structure, such as frost heaving, to thereby extend the useful life of a roadway or other large structure.
It is another object of the present invention to provide cost-effective alternatives to previous large-structure subsurface drainage systems.
An additional object of the invention is to provide unitary geocomposite materials which include both void-maintaining elements and geotextile or other filtration elements having high permitivity for fluids while preventing solid particles that are larger than openings in the filtration element from entering the void-maintaining system.
It is a further object of the present invention to transfer certain quality control aspects of road construction and reconstruction from the construction site to a manufacturing facility for roadway drainage products.
It is yet another object of the present invention to provide subsurface drainage unitary void-maintaining geocomposites as part of a greater road subsurface geosysthentic system to thereby enable efficient reinforcement, separation, filtration, gas transmission and egress, and drainage for a large structure such as a roadway, retaining wall, parking lot or building.
In accordance with this and other objects, the present invention provides a drainage system for draining fluids away from a roadway or other large structure, comprising a unitary void-maintaining geocomposite, the geocomposite comprising a geocomposite core element having a plurality of interconnected voids, the core element having an upper surface and a lower surface, and at least one fluid-transmissible layer of high permittivity adjacent the upper surface, wherein the layers.
The unitary void maintaining geocomposite may further comprise at least one fluid-transmissible layer, for example, a geotextile, adjacent the lower surface of the void-maintaining geocomposite, and may also further comprise drain means adjacent the void-maintaining geocomposite and communicating therewith such that the fluid can move from the void-maintaining geocomposite to the drain means, wherein the drain means is sloped preferably downwardly from the void-maintaining geocomposite. In accordance with advantageous drainage aspects of the invention the void-maintaining geocomposite is sloped downwardly away from a portion of the roadway or the large structure such that the fluid is directed away from the roadway or the large structure and the void-maintaining geocomposite communicates with the drain means under the roadway or at a margin of the roadway or the large structure.
In accordance with additional objects of the invention, the drain means may further comprise a ditch or culvert adjacent a margin of the roadway or the large structure, and the drainage means may comprise perforated piping such as is commonly found in civil engineering applications.
In some preferred embodiments of the present invention, the void-maintaining geocomposite wraps around the circumference of the perforated piping and the perforated piping is connected to further drains means wherein the further drain means is one or more selected from the group consisting of non-perforated pipes, drainage ditches, sumps, canals, streams and rivers. Preferably one or both of the geotextile layers are attached to the geocomposite core element by heat or fusion welding, by laser welding, or by adhesives known in the geotextile arts. Of course, as one of skill in the art can appreciate, in certain applications, it may be most efficacious to position the geotextile layers adjacent the geocomposite core element without attaching them to one another. This may be preferable in situations where separate portions of geocomposite core element are overlapped or butt joined to one another and where it is desirable that no similar joint exists in the corresponding geotextile layer.
In other preferred embodiments of the invention the geocomposite core element comprises a geonet such as that found in U.S. Pat. No. 5,891,549 to Beretta et al. In other preferred embodiments, the geocomposite core element is tri-planar such as shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5,255,998 and comprises polyethlene, polypropylene or other polymer derivatives, and both fluid-transmissible layers are geotextiles that are nonwoven and needle punched. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,891,549 and 5,255,998 are incorporated herein by reference.
In accordance with additional advantageous aspects of the invention, the void-maintaining geocomposite structure is constructed and arranged to form a wrapping adjacent to and around the circumference of the perforated piping such that a portion of one of the upper or lower fluid-transmissible geotextile layers is removed along the length of the wrapping so that the geocomposite core contacts the piping and the removed portion of the one of the upper or lower fluid-transmissible geotextile layers is overlapping and connected to the other surface fluid-transmissible geotextile layer. As one of skill in the art will recognize, it is advantageous to provide piping or other drain means which has a capacity to carry away a sufficient volume of fluid collected through the relatively large surface area of the present geocomposite core element.
Moreover, by interconnecting the various portions of the present invention such that the various interconnecting voids maintain flow paths for fluid such as water entering the system, large areas under highways, buildings, parking lots, and other large structures can be effectively drained without the necessity of complex and expensive structures. In order to maintain the interconnections preferred in the present invention, the overlapping portions of the fluid-transmissible geotextile layers are connected by ties, welding or by sewing, and the portions of the fluid-transmissible geotextile layers and the geocomposite core element of the void-maintaining geocomposite are held adjacent to the piping by circumferential ties around the geocomposite. Of course, as one of skill will recognize, the present invention is particularly advantageous for draining water-containing fluids or other geologic fluids such as petroleum or natural gas from roadways and other large structures.
In accordance with other aspects of the present invention, a drainage system disposed at a level below the top surface of a roadway for draining fluids such as water away from the roadway is provided, wherein the system comprises a unitary void-maintaining geocomposite comprising a geocomposite core element having a plurality of interconnected voids, the core element having an upper surface and a lower surface, and at least one fluid-transmissible geotextile layer of high permittivity attached adjacent the upper surface, wherein the layers are constructed and arranged so that the unitary void-maintaining geocomposite structure maintains voids of sufficient dimension that the water from the roadway can move freely through the geocomposite, and wherein the geocomposite is sloped downwardly from the top surface of the roadway.
Unitary void maintaining composites further comprise at least one fluid-transmissible layer, preferably a geotextile, attached adjacent the lower surface of the core element and, preferably, drain means adjacent the geocomposites and communicating therewith such that the fluid can move from the geocomposites to the drain means, wherein the drain means is sloped downwardly from the geocomposites such that the fluid is directed away from the roadway, wherein the geocomposite is constructed and arranged to provide a capillary break between the roadway pavement system and the earthen materials under the geocomposite.
In accordance with still other aspects of the present invention, the unitary void-maintaining geocomposites of the present invention can be positioned in a roadway to maximize their effectiveness. For example, in order to provide positive drainage functions, as needed, the geocomposite can be positioned intermittently or continuously below the top Portland Cement Concrete (“PCC”) or asphalt layer of the roadway. To provide a capillary break in frost-prone regions, the geocomposite can be placed between the underground water table and frost-penetration depth, or freezing front. The present geocomposites can also be used to provide a capillary break function in non-frost-prone regions where the base layer contains fine grained soil with the potential for vented moisture migration through capillary rising. In order to maximize other advantages of the present invention, the void-maintaining geocomposites may be positioned in multiple layers, and at various levels below the roadway surface in order to maximize drainage efficiency as desired.
The void-maintaining geocomposites of the present invention can be made in large pieces, for example, in pieces several meters wide and many meters long. For convenience and installation, however, the geocomposites of the present invention, or their components can be installed in portions which are interconnected such that the interconnecting voids are of sufficient dimension that the water from the roadway can move freely through the geocomposite and can be connected to drain means such as a ditch or culvert adjacent a margin of the roadway or the large structure or perforated piping.
Moreover, the void-maintaining geocomposites of the present invention can be constructed and arranged to prevent wicking upward, to provide continuous or discontinuous capillary breaks across the area of the geocomposite, or to prevent wicking substantially altogether by the provision of void spaces.
Other advantages of the present invention are found in the methods which it provides. The present invention includes methods for providing drainage systems for roadways or other large structures. For example, the present invention provides a method for constructing a drainage system for draining fluids away from a roadway or other large structure, the method comprising providing a void-maintaining geocomposite including at least one geocomposite core element having a plurality of interconnected voids, the core element having an upper surface and a lower surface, and at least one fluid-transmissible geotextile layer adjacent the upper surface, wherein the components.
Preferably, the void-maintaining geocomposite further comprises at least one fluid-transmissible geotextile layer of high transmissivity adjacent the lower surface of the geocomposite and drain means adjacent the geocomposite and communicating therewith such that the fluid can move from the geocomposite to the drain means, wherein the drain means is sloped downwardly from geocomposite.
The high transmissivity layers and core elements of the void-maintaining geocomposites of the invention can be positioned at junctions between pieces such that high transmissivity between the void spaces maintained within the geocomposite and those of the drain means is maintained. With respect to the joining of large pieces of the geocomposites, this can be accomplished, for example, by providing geotextile layers which extend beyond the margins of the core composite layer, or by positioning additional pieces of geotextile over the joint areas. With respect to the junctions between the drain means and the geocomposites, portions of the geotextiles can be positioned around the drain means to thereby decrease the likelihood of the intrusion of clogging materials and to maintain the connection between voids of the geocomposites and those of the drain means.
The means and methods of the present invention include the positioning of the geocomposites and drain means in many permutations depending on the particular needs of the structure to be drained. For example, geocomposites of the invention can be positioned below the roadway or large structure and above an aggregate layer if desired. Moreover, the present methods include combinations wherein the geocomposite is positioned below the roadway or large structure in portions which are interconnected such that the interconnecting voids are of sufficient dimension that the water from the roadway can move freely through the connecting portions and thereby through the geocomposite. The present methods include wherein the drain means further comprises a ditch or culvert adjacent a margin of the roadway or the large structure.
As a further advantage, the combinations and methods of the invention comprise wherein the roadway base course comprises materials which have been excavated from the subgrade of the roadway and wherein the roadway base course comprises materials which have been excavated from the subgrade of the roadway and mixed with imported materials.

I asked the question a couple of days ago both on Twitter and in G+ and the responses where evenly split among the first two. The third was a suggestion voted in by the community on G+, namely being the inside scoop.
Most of us have an immediate gut reaction to dualistic kinds of questions -- yes and no, either/or, this or that, fight or flight.
Once we start defining the question in more specific terms, our likely choice crystallizes:
- giving news about gifts to children for Christmas
- getting new information about a deep tissue massage
- giving very bad news to a person you care about
- getting a controversial review in a prominent publication
When it comes to reviews, for example, is giving one easier than getting one? Does it depend on its nature? Maybe, partly on the nature of the person doing the giving? How about the one who's getting it? Does your answer change if we're talking about the review of your book vs. the review of your work?
If your answer was / is "it depends", you're thinking in more modern and contemporary terms: It's a choice we're called to make in different situations, at different times, with varying degrees of information at our fingertips.
The answer depends on your focus.
For example, this week, we talked about:
- best bang for the buck -- where an undefined question made me think about another question that is usually asked without definition
- top business trends -- where I pointed out that the other side of the trend coin is case studies. Which are trends seen in the rear view mirror
- trick or trade? -- where the things that scare business people the most are the same that hold the most opportunity for them
- 34 ways to spread your ideas with a blog -- where I concluded that with all its promise, blogging is no substitute for doing. It is a complement to it
- commerce and creativity -- where I said when you cannot make your social media programs work it means you don't know (yet) what the business trades
- Google draws content and sharing together -- where I pointed out that it's not just the seller's strategy we need to examine. We also need to question the buyer's strategy to do good trade
I'm fascinated by these kinds of questions because, more often than not, we live in a both/and world. It's the big ideas and the small gestures, vision and leadership and working in the background as supporting actor, moments of joy years in the making.
That's how you get to be the inside scoop.
Chocolate and pistachio for me. Who can tell me what those two towers mean?

Without being too arty - the towers are the most visible part, but only an afterthought to the "foundation" into which they are stuck.
In this case, the "scoops" ironically enough are the substance. Without that substance, you'll never BE the "inside scoop" and relegated to giving or getting them!
(On the other hand, as you point out in the end, both elements are necessary for a more pleasing overall package.)
Posted by: Mike Marn | November 09, 2011 at 11:13 AM
Well, first of all, I am a sucker for line weight and brush stroke, so it's not uncommon for me to become fascinated with art consisting of a few strokes. "Great art" is subjective and personal - that's where the real greatness lies.
As for the binary/logocentric being nothing new, I wonder how the internet has contributed and if small groups of new-thinking people might tap that power to affect a fundamental change.
Our current economic problems stem from reliance upon industrial revolution, semi-feudal principles. There is a movement to shift that thinking, but how might our view of "others" be psychologically ingrained over the last 1,500 years?
If we have made the environment, after all...

The conservatives on the panel - syndicated columnist Pat Buchanan and the Washington Examiner's Tim Carney - were quick to say "Yes" as their liberal colleagues - Newsweek's Eleanor Clift and the Chicago Tribune's Clarence Page - both equivocated (video follows with transcript and commentary):
JOHN MCLAUGHLIN, HOST: Exit question: Has America done more to spread peace and prosperity than any other power in human history, yes or no?
PAT BUCHANAN: Undeniably. It’s the greatest country in history.

MCLAUGHLIN: The answer is yes, through freedom, capitalism and global trade. We did it more than anybody.
It's quite telling that McLaughlin and the two conservatives were extremely definite with their affirmatives while Clift and Page needed to qualify their answers.
Isn't that the difference between liberals and conservatives?
The latter have no problem talking about American exceptionalism while the former get all tongue-tied when asked to say something positive about the land they live in.

GenèveDavid Didau’s book “What if everything you knew about education was wrong”, has a chapter entitled “Why lesson observation doesn’t work”, which is a fantastic response to members of SLT who think observation is the key to school improvement. However, the one thing he omitted to mention was that observations at secondary level become even more pointless if the observer does not have the specialist subject knowledge.
I remember observing an A level physics class and having to grade it and comment on the teacher’s subject knowledge. I felt a complete fraud. Of course, I could see whether the students seemed engaged, knew what they were doing, were receiving feedback and having their written work marked, but beyond that I didn’t have a clue what the teacher was going on about. She could have been teaching them absolute rubbish, but I wouldn’t have known.
Now that I am a head of department, I have had many observations by people who do not speak or understand a word of the language I have been teaching. I have even had some “outstandings” from them. When you think about it, it is quite frightening to think how easy it could be for me to go on for years peddling misconceptions. Equally, when being criticised, I resent comments from non specialists wondering why the children were noting down vocabulary in the lesson ( surely it was all in their textbook or couldn’t I have given them a sheet), or telling me that it was too teacher centred.
This leads into another issue – we all have our own prejudices as to what constitutes a good lesson and we will look for things that confirm those prejudices and disparage things that don’t. We are all human beings and we are not as objective as we like to think. I have to observe my colleagues teaching and I do not always agree with everyone’s approach. I find it difficult to keep my own prejudices out. Nevertheless, at least my colleagues are aware that I have specialist subject knowledge and know what it is like to teach it, day in and day out.
That being said, Didau has now convinced me that observations as we currently carry them out are largely pointless. He does have some useful ideas as to how to make them better and I recommend his book to anyone who works in education. For myself, the only value of observations is picking up new teaching ideas which I could use.
P.S. I think head teachers might take a different view on observations if they were required to be observed, say twice a year, by a member of the governing body. This person could shadow the head teacher all day and take time at the end to dissect what could have gone better (“that assembly was well handled, but really the phone call to the parent required improvement and you didn’t chair that SLT meeting properly!”). They, too, might then appreciate the need for observers with specialist knowledge!
Reblogged this on The Echo Chamber.
I like the idea of lessons observations to pick up helpful practices from others.
Where I work, performance management hinges on your results and on your lesson ob gradings. I am quite worried because my line manager is the complete opposite to me in terms of teaching style!
Fantastic idea.
They should teach AND be observed, and not just by their ‘friends’ who they’ve just promoted.
They need to have a class for 1 yr or 2 so that they have some personal VA to defend.
They should show us sets of books so that we can all see how well they are following their own marking policies.
Also I have come to the conclusion that I am ‘pissing in the wind’ regarding appraisal as a recent lesson was downgraded because of what I consider to be subjective contradictory opinions.
I teach in an open spaced modern learning environment. I have to say that I learn far more in terms of observations teaching next to people teaching different subjects across a year then I can merely going into one-off sessions. To make any meaningful conclusion or discussion it must be a prolonged period of observing & conversations.We already knew they were good but now we know they have guts. Down to 10 men for most of the second half, Rudi Garcia’s Roma kept their 100 per cent record intact on a tricky trip to Udine. A single Michael Bradley strike was enough to make it nine wins out of nine.
The doubters had the Stadio Friuli pegged as a potential venue for the table-toppers to trip up. It was not so much the quality of the opposition as questions about how they might cope with adversity which raised such suggestions. With the ever-influential Francesco Totti and something-of-a-revelation Gervinho both ruled out with injury, it would have been easy for the Giallorossi to drop their first points. But this team has replaced the comic collapses of last season with a real ruthless streak.
“This is a tough place to come to,” said Garcia post-match. “We knew that they had not lost at home for more than a year and then we went down to 10 men. In the first half we struggled with their counter-attacks and left them too much space, but in the second half we made some changes and things went better.”
Injured skipper Totti was more colourful in his praise. He reckoned his team had shown the physical attributes most often associated with courage. “It doesn’t matter who plays,” he added. “We are all Roma.”
The capital club can banish all doubt over who holds the record for the best start to a Serie A season with a midweek win over Chievo. Fabio Capello’s Juventus also managed nine wins out of nine but that was a campaign which ultimately saw them stripped of their Scudetto. Garcia’s side can put that debate to bed with one more victory.
Their closest pursuers both needed penalties to help keep the five-point gap unaltered at the top of the table. Napoli converted two spot-kicks through Gonzalo Higuain to down an off-colour Torino side. The referee could easily have given neither of them, but Giampiero Ventura was honest enough to admit his team was off the pace for most of the match.
Meanwhile, in Turin, a was-it-in-the-box-or-not decision helped Juve bounce back with Arturo Vidal breaking the deadlock against Genoa from the spot and Carlos Tevez adding another. The machine-gun celebration stayed in its holster this Sunday.
In his post-match interviews Antonio Conte did, however, take a potshot at journalists who he claimed were trying to destabilise the club. He dismissed reports of a rift between himself and director Beppe Marotta as “nonsense”. “Stick to talking about football and how the team plays,” he thundered. “Don’t go inventing things about the relationship between myself and the club.”
A little further down the table, Inter and Fiorentina kept themselves in European contention with wins over the two halves of Verona. The Nerazzurri saw off Hellas in a six-goal Saturday night battle which left their boss Walter Mazzarri raging about their lapses in concentration. Last season those kind of blackouts cost the Milanese giants dearly, but this term it seems they have a little more focus. No doubt, however, their Coach has work to do to eliminate them entirely.
As for the Viola, they have clearly acquired a taste for winning matches from a losing position. In the opening weeks of the season they threw away a number of matches they were leading, but on Sunday they came from one goal behind to see off Chievo. It was the Juan Cuadrado show with the Colombian netting a double to turn the game around. Little wonder the flying wide-man has half of Europe tracking him now.
There was a morale-boosting win for Lazio who were jeered off at half-time during their Sunday night clash with Cagliari before Miro Klose helped bring them to life. After last week’s rumours that Vlad Petkovic might be on his way out, it was a vital three points. The feel-good factor from the Coppa Italia win over Roma has vanished quicker than the snacks at Antonio Cassano’s birthday party.
Talking of FantAntonio, he had a part to play in plunging Milan’s Serie A season into further misery. He scored one of the goals in a 3-2 Parma triumph over Massimiliano Allegri’s side. If you wanted an emblem of their campaign thus far it was the way a defensive wall fell apart to allow Marco Parolo to thump home the winner after the Rossoneri had fought back from two goals down.
Elsewhere, Sampdoria and Bologna both got wins which gave their League position a more healthy look, but there would be no such tonic for Catania at home to Sassuolo. Despite dumping boss Rolando Maran last weekend, the Sicilians could do no better than a goalless draw. Only time will tell whether appointing Gigi De Canio was really the answer to the problems at the Massimino but it looked like a typically Italian panic measure at the time and that impression remains. Hats off to the likes of Chievo, Bologna and Sassuolo who have – at the time of writing at least – resisted the temptation to follow a similar course of action.

With next to no deterioration on the Warner Park driveway, South Africa’s batting out the day was a formality – the side losing just three wickets till the final hour after tea, when the captains expectedly decided to call it off.
Earlier, Graeme Smith looked solid before falling for 46 to Shane Shillingford, cutting one time too many tto a delivery turning away. Conversely Alviro Petersen was watchful – he had a slip, silly point and silly mid-off but negated their influence with steady, mature play.
Hashim Amla, however, was circumspect against the turn and bounce. Given a life on 21 by Dwayne Bravo (who dropped him at slip) Amla illustrated his worth – 5 impressive boundaries around the wicket against the slower bowlers tempering his previous edginess. But Shillingford again derailed him in the forties (41 to the first innings’ 44). Dwayne Bravo then ended both the innings and Petersen’s contribution; his yorker castling the opener for 39.
Kallis and AB de Villiers (31*) ensured the draw with their unbeaten 104-run stand, the match crawling to a close as the pair worked on their averages. Kallis was solid as ever against the seamers, and with Shillingford adopting a defensive line, was asked few questions by the spinners. He reached his fifty-third half-century just before the tea break.
South Africa declared an hour in to the tea break to bring about the Test’s premature but warranted end. The Proteas still hold a 1-0 series lead with one Test to play, but the match signals the end of a nine match Caribbean winning streak for the tourists. (second innings) 235-3 declared
Jacques Kallis 62*, Graeme Smith 46, Shane Shillingford 2-80

I could be wrong, but I don't think anyone is arguing that Pandas isn't incredibly powerful and useful. Pandas DataFrames simply aren't suitable as the built-in "table" implementation in Astropy--on some level it's overkill, and on other levels it's insufficient for some required use cases.

Just in case you haven’t heard it yet, WE WON! Damn right we nailed it!
College of Arts and Sciences (CAS) placed 2nd in this year’s Cheerdance Competition. The College of Engineering (COE) still reigns as the champion, while the College of International Tourism and Hospitality Management (CITHM) went home as 1st runner-up.
Technically, they won. But I’m just so attached with this college that I still count myself in even if I had already graduated. I know, so clingy. Once a CAS student, always a CAS student. HAHAHA.
This is just another congratulatory post for them. One among the many. They did great they deserve to know how amazing they were. J
What can I say, their performance was really something. It’s unexplainable how we, the audience, were able to feel their spirit oozing with confidence and passion. We had goosebumps not just once, but every time they perfected a stunt. One could actually see in their performance how badly they wanted to win. I guess that was what truly brought them to victory - their strong desire to bring home the bacon. J
Frankly speaking, the trainers, the alumni and other third party people weren't really sure whether or not they’d make it. Not because they thought the kids were incapable, but maybe because they could feel that the kids still lack the drive to give their all. Also, all the other colleges were just as intense and competitive! Super! So to boost their energy, everyone who loves CAS decided to give them the push they needed. There was this overflowing support in different ways – money, presence, prayers.
So come Feb. 15, they all did what they had to do. They owned their performance! Yeehaaa! There were very few flaws. There weren't any stunt failures. They didn’t have poker faces. Their execution wasn’t lame. It was something to be proud of, truly. If you actually saw how they were during practice, the effect on you would be even greater. Those who helped during the training cried buckets of tears while watching because they knew all their efforts weren’t put to waste. To the CAS Pep members, it was a glorious moment. None of it would be possible without them. It was the members who have redeemed their place in the competition. Now that we once again claimed our spot, the only thing left to do is to never lose it again. J
Congratulations, CAS Pep!
Why are we doing this?
ALL FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!

July 22, 2013 at 12:35am by Scott • 11 Comments »
A couple weeks ago, Eric Wright was arrested in Los Angeles for DUI. And this past week he was told he can just stay out West since Mark Dominik traded him to the 49ers for a conditional draft pick in 2014. The draft pick is actually a bonus since Dominik was perfectly fine with releasing Wright outright. He should have used the same cannon he shot Tanard Jackson off to Washington with.
“I can assure you the decisions we make as an organization are in the best interest of the team, and therefore we decided to trade Eric Wight, and we’re looking forward to the start of training camp and the players we have here,” Buccaneers general manager Mark Dominik said.
I really wasn’t counting on Wright anyway, so this doesn’t disappoint me in the least. Johnthan Banks won’t have any safety net in camp — he’s the guy now. Assuming Darrelle Revis is ready to go, that’s a good cornerback tandem. And the starting safeties are both proven playmakers. I’m feeling pretty good about the starters. Now if any of them tear, rip, break or smoke anything, we have a problem.
The Bucs also have cornerbacks Leonard Johnson, Danny Gorrer, Anthony Gaitor and Michael Adams, a free agent who played six seasons in Arizona.
Adams has the most experience, but even though he has played in a bunch of games in six years, he only started seven. He has three total picks and looks like a career nickel. Which isn’t a bad thing to have on the roster — but does it qualify as quality depth?
General manager Mark Dominik essentially turned up his nose at one of the largest free agent cornerback classes in recent years. Every team evaluates players differently. But none of those players were cost prohibitive and many took one-year deals: the Dolphins’ Sean Smith (three years, $16.5 million with Chiefs); the Falcons’ Brent Grimes (one year, $5.5 million with Dolphins); the Jags’ Derek Cox (four years, $20 million with Chargers); the Eagles’ Nnamdi Asomugha (one year, up to $3 million with 49ers); the Eagles’ Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie (one year, $5 million with Broncos); the Falcons’ Dunta Robinson (three years with Chiefs), to name a few.
We talked about this during the beginning of free agency and one of them is looking pretty good as real competition for Banks right about now. The pickins are pretty slim out there now. Anyone want Elbert Mack back? I’m not seeing anyone out there any better than what the Bucs have on the roster now, so I don’t think they’re going to dip back into free agency for a corner unless someone gets hurt in camp. But cornerbacks are known to stay pretty healthy, right?

LULZ, he failed his physical.
jampersands (July 24, 2013 at 09:44pm) :
Either Nnamdi or Brent Grimes should be a Buccaneer right now. No reason we couldn’t have offered them equal contract, if not more.
SGBuc (July 25, 2013 at 11:23am) :
I think despite his own legal troubles Talib saw the field and was more productive than this fool. Bucs have a weakness at CB depth but at least our starters should be legit.
A topic that I think hasn’t been discussed much is our LBs, will they be elite this year? The only one I can name is Dakota Watson and that is only because I’m a big FSU fan
manbearpig (July 26, 2013 at 06:45pm) :
You can only name Watson?! Did you watch any games last year? Lavonte David. Haven’t seen that kind of speed from a wslb since mr. 55.
jampersands (July 26, 2013 at 09:51pm) :
David and Mason Foster are both very solid. Watson might not even be a starter. But Watson, Casillas, and Hayward aren’t exactly an embarrassment of riches at the strong side position.
BucNole (July 27, 2013 at 08:13am) :
Well shoot, I can’t believe I forgot about Lavonte David and Mason Foster

I’m working on an entry that will hopefully explain myself a little. But I’m long-winded and boring, so it’s taking a while to put together.
manbearpig (August 02, 2013 at 06:40pm) :
Hey Scott. Got a question and maybe you can dig up an answer. I could google but google wont spin the answer in a smart ass way. I read that the GM of the niners has been seen with Eric Wright. The niners just failed him on a physical negating the trade with the bucs therefore not giving us a draft pick. If they sign him do the bucs get any compensation? Is this “legal”? Seems kinda f-ed up. Can the bucs file a grievance? So many questions.
Enjoy your weekend dude.
BamBamBuc (August 04, 2013 at 01:58am) :
Yeah, I think Scott’s got a serious girl. Only thing that can keep him away from the Bucs for long AND not put clickies up when he writes… lol. When’s the wedding?

Posted: June 21, 2012|
A LINCOLNSHIRE firm that won big in a major competition run by one of the world's biggest banks has urged other businesses to get involved, as it looks to India for new markets.
Luxus, the Louth-based plastics recycler headed by managing director Peter Atterby, was named regional winner of HSBC's Business Thinking challenge last year.
The company is now heading to the national final, with further financial incentives up for grabs, having already launched an academy and significantly expanded research and development facilities with the last prize.
Mr Atterby, who was also flown to Hong Kong with other regional winners as part of the event, told an audience of his peers at a regional launch for 2012's Global Connections competition, that Luxus now sells 24,000 tonnes of compound for use in sectors including the automotive market, employs 140 people on Fairfield Industrial Estate and generates a £21-million turnover.
It is currently working with companies in India to set up operations there too, as it looks to win supply contracts with car manufacturers on a global basis.
And he underlined the Business Thinking competition's role in giving the firm the confidence to strive. He said: "The opportunity to benchmark our thinking in a global market was excellent for us. It is incredible and through it, I have met a lot of people – some brash, some studious, some techy, all of them had something to offer. As long as you enter for the experience, rather than competing, there is a lot to be gained.
"It has increased our confidence and every one of our employees now goes out there and sells our products with pride."
Telling how he was reluctant at first, Mr Atterby pulled down the obvious barriers for those looking to be one of the top 30 firms involved this year.
He said: "'Are we good enough?' was one question I first posed. We all go through the same process, thinking we are not very big. The challenge is not about size and what you do, it is about how you think and what you think about the future.
"The time it would take was another consideration. Time is extremely valuable and it took me away from the day-to-day, but I think it is some of the best time I ever invested in terms of looking at the business and presenting it in another way."
It has also led to a closer relationship with the bank, which has helped with recent global growth aspirations.
Mr Atterby said: "We have formulated a well thought out plan for the market of India with UKTI and HSBC. We did a tremendous amount of planning before we went, and it was time well invested as we hit the ground ruining. We now have the ability to sell products in the Indian market, we have appointed an agent and we are validating six companies to supply to us there.
"We have moved forward with pride and confidence. India and global markets are the answer. However, you look at it, Europe is in a mess."

The 24-year-old innocent victim was a newlywed and father-to-be. The tragedy happened between 5:45 and 6 a.m.. that morning when police believe two people were involved in the murder.
An Apr. 3 report by CBS News explained that Trapuzzano was followed by two suspects. One "acted as a lookout" and the other was a gunman. In surveillance video footage obtained by police, they saw one suspect trying to catch up with Trapuzzano walking and another person showing up a short time later. Nathan Trapuzzano was gunned down right after that.
Police say the man was killed for "absolutely no reason" and that's what makes this murder "particularly troubling." Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Dept. is urging anyone who may know something about this to come forward. They said they would do everything in their power to protect their identity in an effort to find the two suspects. They believe they live in the area.
Trapuzzano leaves behind his wife, Jennifer Trapuzzano, and their unborn child due next month.
What a senseless act of violence. Was it someone who knew the victim or just a random act of violence? Nathan Trapuzzano was killed during the best time of his life and his wife must deal with that unthinkable reality in addition to having a baby soon. Hopefully police will capture these two criminals soon!

FIG. 6 shows an alternative configuration to the communication system environment for an embodiment of the present invention.
FIG. 7 shows the operational flow of the network and transport layers of the stack of FIG. 3 for the repeater of FIG. 6 when providing communications FIG. 1. A patient 100 has an implantable pulse generator 104 that provides therapy and/or monitoring for the heart 102 of the patient 100. The implantable pulse generator 104 transmits wireless signals 108 containing data packets typically subdivided into data frames to external devices to transfer data to the external devices for review, such as trending data or real-time electrogram data. The wireless signals 108 may be magnetic signals that are exchanged via inductive coupling between the implantable pulse generator 104 and an external device. Alternatively, the wireless signals 108 may be radio frequency electromagnetic signals that are exchanged between an RF transceiver of the implantable pulse generator 104 and an external device..
FIG. 2 illustrates the components of an implantable pulse generator 104. The implantable pulse generator 104 includes one or more processing devices 202 that perform various processing functions. The processing device 202 typically executes some form of operating system providing basic services to exchange data with memory 204 when executing application programs to provide therapy, monitoring, and/or communication functions. FIG. 3. Another header layer may be included outside of the transport control header to provide network routing information, such as the network address of the intended recipient device and/or additional instruction as discussed below with reference to FIG. 3..
FIG. 3 illustrates a communication stack implemented by the implantable pulse generator 104 according to an embodiment of the present invention. An operating system 302 is executed by the processor 202 from memory 204 to provide a platform upon which the subsequent layers of the communication stack may be performed and provides basic services that layers of the stack utilize to function and to interface to the other layers. Such basic services include access to buffer space and code in memory 204 and access to the physical layer aspects of the network interface 210. The operating system 302 provides additional basic services as well such as timer services and event notifications..
FIG. 4 illustrates the basic logical operations performed by the information exchange instructions being executed by the processor 202 to handle the transport layer 308 functions, and network layer 310 functions where necessary, for outgoing data packets. Initially, the application data to send is obtained at the transport layer 308 from the application program 304 through a standard interface such as TAPI 306 at data operation 402. Upon obtaining the data, the transport layer 308 divides the data into packets for transmission at packet operation 404. FIG. 5 for receiving packets, discussed below. If the transport layer does not detect that an acknowledgement has been received, then operational flow returns to packet operation 404 where the packet is passed down the layers to receive the transport, network, and data link header information and is sent again to the recipient. Typically, this re-send occurs after a timeout period maintained by the transport layer. If query operation 412 detects that an acknowledge message has been received, then the packet that has been sent is discarded at packet operation 414. Operational flow then returns to data operation 402.
FIG. 5 illustrates the complementary basic logical operations performed by the information exchange instructions being executed by the processor 202 to handle the transport layer 308, and network layer 310 functions where necessary, for incoming data packets. Initially, the received data packets are obtained from the data link layer at data link operation 502. Then, the network routing information is extracted from the header of each packet at network operation 504. Upon extracting the information, the network layer 310 may simply discard this information and proceed to transport operation 510 or may perform an additional verification that the packet was intended for the implantable pulse generator 104 at query operation 506. If query operation 506 detects that the network address contained in the network routing information does not match the network address of the implantable pulse generator 104, then the packet is discarded at packet operation 508. If the network address matches, then operational flow proceeds to transport operation 510. FIG. 4 for sending packets as discussed above. As also discussed above, the transport layer of a sender checks for receipt of this acknowledge packet, such as at query operation 412 of FIG. 4, to determine whether to re-send the data packet to the recipient.
FIG. 6 illustrates an alternative system of transferring information between an implantable pulse generator 604 and a data network 612. As with FIG. 1, the pulse generator of patient 600 is linked to the patient's heart 602 and transmits wireless signals 606. Furthermore, a repeater 610 receives the signals 606 and transmits wireless signals 608 back to the pulse generator 604. The repeater 610 has a wired connection to a data network 612.
The system of FIG. 6 addresses issues caused by utilizing certain standard transport protocols such as TCP when transmitting data over a wireless link between a data network and a pulse generator, such as through a repeater. While the lower layers of the stack may deal with re-tries of communication without causing a breakdown in the communication system, the transport layer of the pulse generator 604 or data network 612 may see the delay as indicating lost packets and then begin to increase the retransmission of packets exponentially up to a predefined maximum value. There is a re-transmission timeout for each time a packet is retransmitted, and this timeout also increases exponentially. After several consecutive re-transmission timeouts for sending packets, the transport layer may consider the link broken such that the sending side drops the connection entirely. Furthermore, because the transport layer does not reset the re-transmission timeout value upon a link being re-established, this value can grow to a large value that causes lengthy delays before a packet can be re-sent even though the link to send over may be available during the lengthy delay.
As shown in FIG. 6, this system addresses these issues by providing two transport layer connections, one for each subnetwork that is present. The first transport layer connection is established between the pulse generator 604 and the repeater 610 for the wireless subnetwork. Additionally, the second transport layer connection is established between the repeater 610 and the data network 612 for the wired subnetwork. Because the repeater 610 acts as the bridge between the two subnetworks, the repeater 610 must perform bridging operations, discussed below with reference to FIG. 7, between the two transport layer connections rather than perform simple router functions like the repeater 114 of FIG..
FIG. 7 illustrates the bridging operations of the repeater 610. The repeater includes standard components for implementing the communication stack of FIG. 3, including a processor, memory, and network interface. The bridging operations begin by the repeater 610 receiving a packet from a network endpoint A (either the data network 612 or pulse generator 604) over a subnetwork via the data link layer at data link operation 702. Then, the repeater 610 extracts the network routing data from the packet header at network operation 704. The network layer then detects whether the packet is addressed to the repeater 610 at query operation 706. FIG. 4, to determine whether to re-send the data packet to the repeater 610.
As discussed in relation to FIG. 7, the transport operations 710 and 716 operate according to different configurations of the two transport layers in use by the repeater 610 so that the transport layer connections are optimized, one for wired transfer and one for wireless transfer. These bridging operations of FIG. 7 for the repeater 610 thereby facilitate the transfer of data packets between the data network 612 and the pulse generator 604..

Kids had their lines whispered to them, wiggled in their costumes and cried on stage as they performed the traditional Christmas play.Parents smiled, snapped photos and applauded at the adorable nativity play that tells the story of the holy night of Jesus’ birth.True to the “one night that changed the world,” as Pastor Tim Holland said, the children at Grace Baptist Church put together and performed the show in just one night.Holland’s wife, Alice, came up with the idea as a way to serve the community by offering a chance to participate in a Christmas play “without making the holidays crazier.”“It will be just as sweet with an afternoon and evening of practicing as it would be if we’d met over and over again,” she said. “And they’ll have a memory they can take into adulthood with them. “One evening to practice, sing, love Jesus and everybody has a good time and goes home.”Mother Shanan Stevens said she was “blown away” with the play, which started three hours after she dropped off her children to prepare.The photos and smiles she got from seeing her children perform the story of Christmas were every bit as memorable.“They’re all so cute,” Stevens said. “It’s such a blessing to all of us.”Her son, Jay, played the part of Joseph, which Stevens didn’t know until she saw him on stage.The children were assigned parts and began learning lines at 4 p.m. on Wednesday.For the most part, they would be able to repeat something the narrator had said to keep the memorization to a minimum.At 5:45 p.m., the children found their costumes on a chair by their names, and they used sheets and props to transform into shepherds, sheep and angels.A member of the church’s acting group for teens, Autumn Musgrave, helped get the kids dressed and quizzed them on their lines.Ariana Henderson, portraying Mary, said she had just one line, which momentarily escaped her memory.Musgrave cued her, “It’s when you get mad, you say … ”“He was not leaving me at home,” Henderson said, crossing her arms.She was ready for the stage.About 6 p.m. the first run-through began.Tim Holland, the narrator, read his opening line.“Many, many years ago, the prophets of Israel promised a coming savior,” he said, meeting silence.He then whispered: “Micah’s supposed to go to center stage.”The kids got up and down from the stage, changed places as the director moved them and repeated their lines as they forgot them.The lone dress rehearsal began immediately afterward. It was about 6:30 p.m.Parents started to filter in as the kids rushed off to eat a snack and the adults tried to calm the nerves created by the fast pace of the night.“It’s time to do this,” said Jay Stevens, as Joseph high-fived Mary in the line-up to go on stage.As they walked out singing “Jingle Bells,” no one gave any thought to the time spent creating the children’s Christmas tradition.Musgrave said the church has done Christmas plays in the past, for which she attended several rehearsals and did a lot of work.“I think it was rough,” she said of the one night concept, “but it’s good because people who don’t know about the Lord can come and learn.”Alice Holland said the play was a “tremendous outreach.”The open role call for a Christmas play experience in a single evening drew in more than two dozen kids who had attended Grace Baptist frequently, occasionally and never.Enjoying cookies after the show, Henderson said she had fun playing Mary and telling the story to the audience.“It’s the most important thing about Christmas that we showed them,” she said.

Important Advances in the Management of Advanced Colorectal Cancer
Colorectal cancer is a worldwide public health problem, with nearly 800,000 new cases diagnosed each year resulting in approximately 500,000 deaths. In the United States, it is the second leading cause of cancer mortality, and nearly 60,000 deaths will be attributed to this disease in 2005. in the 21- to 24-month range in patients with metastatic disease. Chemotherapy has been the mainstay approach for patients with advanced colorectal cancer. United States biologic agents were approved by the FDA: the anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) bevacizumab (Avastin) and the anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibody cetuximab (Erbitux). In this supplement to ONCOLOGY, Paulo Hoff and Scott Kopetz present a timely overview of the recent treatment advances in cytotoxic chemotherapy strategies for metastatic disease. The availability of several front-line combination regimens now makes it possible to consider tailoring therapies for individual patients based on preferences relating to oral vs intravenous medication, on patient preferences for toxicity profile, as well as on results from pharmacogenomic analyses. There are growing clinical data that the oral fluoropyrimidine capecitabine can replace infusional schedules of 5-FU/leucovorin as the backbone of combination regimens with oxaliplatin or irinotecan, leading to a marked reduction in toxicity with no compromise in clinical efficacy. In addition, there is growing evidence that the elderly patient population can be treated with the same combination therapies as younger patients with the same degree of clinical benefit and toxicity. John Marshall and Jimmy Hwang provide a nice review on the key advances that were presented at this year's annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology relating to the integration of biologic targeted agents into the routine management of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. They discuss the role of bevacizumab in combination with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy in the first- and second-line settings and show that the addition of bevacizumab confers significant clinical benefit to cytotoxic chemotherapy without exacerbating toxicity. They review the role of EGFR as a potential target for chemotherapy and review the different anti-EGFR inhibitor compounds, including monoclonal antibodies and small molecules, that are being developed clinically for the treatment of advanced colorectal cancer. While the anti-EGFR chimeric monoclonal antibody cetuximab was initially approved for refractory disease, there is now growing focus on combining this agent with either oxaliplatin- or irinotecan-based regimens in the first- and second-line settings; the results generated thus far suggest promising clinical activity. Finally, while the incorporation of biologic agents into cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens has certainly resulted in improved clinical benefit for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, the goal is to extend these combination regimens to the neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant setting to begin to effect real, substantive cure of patients with colorectal cancer.

(The Six O’Clock Triple Shot is a daily feature of three songs that share a common theme, heard weeknights on 94.9 WMMQ)
Tonight, we pay homage to Alan Parsons, leader of British Prog-Rockers The Alan Parsons Project, and Grammy nominated Engineer of Pink Floyd’s Dark Side of the Moon. Parsons celebrates his 65th birthday today. Despite not having new studio material since 1987, and a breakup with the late co-founder Eric Woolfson (1945-2009, The Project continues to tour to this day, though under the moniker The Alan Parsons Live Project. The Project just wrapped up a couple of European Dates this week. In September, to mark the 35th Anniversary of the I Robot LP, Arista/Legacy Records released I Robot: The Legacy Edition. The two-disc set features the original track listing, as well as previously unreleased material, and Project memorabilia.
Tonight, we feature three from the original 1977 I Robot LP…”I Robot”, “Breakdown”, and “I Wouldn’t Want To Be Like You”…The Six O’Clock Triple Shot, only on 94.9 WMMQ!!! Happy birthday, Alan!September 20, 2011-September 21, 2011 – I was watching the season premiere of SNL. It started with an announcement of the cast members, instead of the cold open. This opening montage featured a still photo of each cast member in the middle of the screen against a background of lights that looked like sped-up traffic. Kenan was the first one announced. Then there was a short opening sketch, which was barely an opening sketch. Alec Baldwin, the night’s host, was in the opening. At the end of the opening, nobody said, “Live from New York…” – it instead cut to the montage. Kenan was again the first cast member announced. After the montage, Amy Poehler introduced Maroon 5, who then performed. Amy remained on the main stage during the performance. It turned out that Amy was romantically involved with Adam Levine. This didn’t make sense to me, because, last I heard, she was still married to Will Arnett. I was wondering why Maroon 5 were performing, since Radiohead were the musical guest. Then I saw some indication that Amy wasn’t actually involved with Adam Levine and that she was still married to Will Arnett. But, ultimately it wasn’t clear either way.

80 Going on 82
With oil prices and subsequently the cost of electricity at a historic high, enthusiasts with a decked out system may be aghast at their increasing electricity bill. That's when modern energy efficient technologies earn their pay. One of the more significant energy efficient initiatives in recent years is the 80 PLUS program, which gives the 80 PLUS certification to power supplies (PSU) that meet the minimum 80% power efficiency rating. Obviously such a scheme is another way for PSU manufacturers to differentiate and market their premium products and here to raise this standard today, we have the Enermax MODU82+.
Raising the Power Stakes
Our review unit from Enermax is its flagship 625W model, which along with its higher power output, also has additional power sockets for its modular cables compared to the other models (425W and 525W). Hence, one can connect more devices to the more powerful 625W model, which only makes sense. As mentioned earlier, Enermax has raised the bar with a PSU that exceeds the 80 PLUS standard. The MODU82+ is rated between 82 - 88% efficient and has an active PFC rating of more than 0.97 (part of the 80 PLUS certification includes Active PFC > 0.9).
Preparing for the Future
Besides supporting the latest processors from both AMD and Intel, the Enermax MODU82+ is also suitable for SLI and CrossFireX. To accommodate the newer graphics cards, the PCIe power connectors are all version 2.0 ready, meaning that they can fit both 6-pins and 8-pins (6 + 2 pins) connectors. As its name suggest, this PSU has modular power cables so you can only choose the cables that your system requires. Enermax did include four PCIe power cables, which are connected to the PSU end via custom 12-pin connectors. This is Enermax's idea of future-proofing its PSU to meet the growing number of pins used on graphics cards. If (or when) the day comes for a move to a 10 or even 12-pin PCIe connector, Enermax simply releases the appropriate cables for sale, with minimal disruption to consumers.
Then there are also the proprietary technologies like SpeedGuard, which is Enermax's fancy way of saying the two-ball bearing 120mm fan comes with intelligent speed control, with a mild RPM of between 450 and 2000. SafeGuard is the umbrella term for all the protection circuitry found on the PSU while AirGuard refers to the air intake design around the fan opening that supposedly leads to lower fan noise.
We did have some reservations however. Firstly, while it's commendable that Enermax can support up to four graphics cards, the relatively mid-range power rating (625W for the flagship model) may not be sufficient for high-end multi GPU setups. For example, a pair of NVIDIA's latest GeForce 9800 GTX requires a PSU of at least 750W. Perhaps Enermax should consider having a model of at least 800W output for the enthusiasts.
Final Thoughts
With its attractive feature list, it's no surprise that the MOD82+ 625W is one of the more expensive models for its power output at around US$199. However, for a relatively modest 625W PSU, the price tag may deter some consumers, while power users may find 625W insufficient for today's high-end system. If you have no such reservations, then this is a quiet, energy efficient performer with features that should stay relevant for the next three years at least.Description

But no nap, or too little nap, and, well, it's ugly from about 4:30 onwards. U-G-L-Y you ain't got no alibi UGLY. Every step is agony, every word is whined, she can't follow directions, and she can't self-direct. There's yelling and tears. She has me looking up boarding Montessori preschools on the no-nap days. So
I've been experimenting with shortening her nap: yesterday was one-and-a-half hours, but I heard her chatting away in her bed as I brushed my own teeth around 11:00. That's a problem because she didn't want to get up for preschool. She buried under the covers when I opened the shades, and I felt like I was trying to pry a teenager out of bed (albeit one with purple pacifier. Please God, may she not still have the pacifier in high school). Today, I woke her up after an hour and 15 minutes, and she exhibited the worst of both scenarios: a train wreck who refused to go to sleep.
I hear her up there now moaning, "Mooom-my. I'm having trouble!" And I think I'm going to forego trying to craft a conclusion to this post (because there clearly isn't one, yet), and pour myself a glass of wine, and go to bed myself. Maybe leading by example is the way to go here?
Smart Mommy; wine is definitely the way to go.
I could have written that exactly about Little Mouse! Today she's napping (we're going out tonight.) Yesterday she did not (and we most certainly stayed in.)
I hope they both give up the paci before middle school.
Maybe she is a night owl. Once a night owl, always a night owl.
she'll grow out of it . . . eventually. Although by that time you may have consumed quite a few bottles of wine! Hang in there!
I know Nathan is younger, so I am actually less experienced as a mom so maybe I am way off base -- but what about waking her up earlier in the mornings, so that you can start her nap earlier in the afternoon? Then when you wake her after say 1.5 hours, the end of the nap will be earlier than it had been, with a longer waking interval before bedtime, which might make bedtime faster and easier.
Hang in there.
does that mean the next time she comes down requesting something to drink, you'll pour her a glass too?
I agree, the nap is a sacred thing in the mommy world, without which, most mommies cannot survive. When our daughter was about Buzzy's age, we began the great conversion from nap to quiet time. This is when you establish that between 45 minutes - 1 hour of "room time" where shades are drawn low, lights turned off and noisy toys removed. You lay down the ground rules and drill it like Patton over a 4 week period: 1. talking only in whispers, 2. all activities occur on the bed 3. book "reading" permitted (refer back to 1 & 2), 4. playing with toys OK, 5. staying on bed, lying down if you feel drowsy encouraged, 6. ABSOLUTELY NO coming out of the room [except for potty] until Mommy comes to get you. keep us posted and Bon Chance!This site works best with JavaScript enabled.

lol at noob who said have you ever seen barbs duel wield mighty weapons
i've never had a worthwhile sickle drop.... or the carver weapon either. They are always whites so i ignore them.
But as far as logic goes I think they are 1 handers that deal slightly more damage than normal 1 handers, hence being "mighty".
Does anyone know anything about this?
There wont be any best spec... If you wanna go ''pure dps'' well this is your choice to die quick and have no MF + GF...
Stop thinking about build and shit, you see a frozen minion, swap one two spell, play with that, you see an arcane minion, put some interrupt spells.
please don't think d3 is an mmo lol
lol owned. On topic though you cant possibly expect a barb to play like wizard, or any other class. So why expect that from the monk? I suspect the monk will be played defensively for maximum effectiveness. To not take breath of heaven in pvp is foolish.
I'm going for the latter, a couple of defensive abilites, Dashing Strike for that incredible mobility and then the most destructive spirit gen and spender.
either they did a good job and monk is decent, being able to solo inferno without spending 10 hours every monster (would mean bad dps but heals) or monk sucks.
But really... it's the same for almost everybody. Monk are no healers, they heal a bit while fighting but it has nothing to do with an mmo. If game is well balanced, either monk heals are equal to other classes defensives, or monk heals are superior and he does a little bit less damage like 90%. Doing 90% but having better survivability is not a bad trade-off.
This is assuming the game is well made hence having faith or not.
Also... PvP is like not before 6months imo, you may have enough time to get 2-3 classes by then.

The circus surrounding Jade Goody was mind boggling, what is it about the Brits and their need to connect with a celebrity-any celebrity? Are their lives that empty?
Bill Leith’s attitude to the Stern Gang is shared by many Britons. Yet less than ten years later in 1956 Britain and France became Israel’s first overt allies.
what is it about the Brits and their need to connect with a celebrity-any celebrity? Are their lives that empty?
Another brain-dead Brit-bashing fest. Have you read the National Enquirer lately? The celebrity culture started in America, and you don’t get much trashier than Hollywood.
Nobody I know gives a sh*t about Jade Goody. Carol Gould is giving her the “oxygen of publicity” here. In six months’ time she’ll be forgotten.
Bill Leith was indeed a remarkable man. Talking of which, Britain’s oldest man, WW1 veteran Henry Allingham is 112 years 295 days old. He is the sole survivor of the Battle of Jutland. More <a href=””here.
A RAF veteran tells how when his squadron was told to be transformed to Spitfires, pilots had for days an idiotic smile and about the rude blow to their egos when the first Spitfire landed and a diminutive ATA emerged from her looking like it wasn’t harder than a Tiger Moth (a very easy to fly plane for basic training)
I don’t think anyone has the celebrity culture cornered like America does. But I think celebs fill the vacuum not having any real royalty creates. Of course, now that The One has ascended to office, he is starting to fill that void in many of my friends’ lives. I wish they would go back to worshiping Will Smith.
Thanks for telling this story. These people should be remembered, and no, it has nothing to do with celebrity. It is simply part of a great country’s history, and should be remembered.
Speaking as an American, I say there is much to be admired in the history of our oldest ally, and examples great and small support Churchill’s claim, for this was one of Britain’s finest hours.
For those Brits reading this, my apologies for our neophyte President’s tacky handling of the visit of your Prime Minister.
I think that anyone dying so young is a tradegy, so even though Jade Goody was not my type I cannot help but feel sorry for her and her kids, even though as a celeb she was an example of everyuthing that is wrong with Britain, to have kind words from Gordan Brown said it all…
Bill Leith sounds like a true Brit and in that I salute him, my father recently lost a friend who was on the Eagle when it was sunk on the famous convoy to Malta, which kept the island going at a critical time, he died in late 2008 and my father was devestated, the Royal Navy put the boat out at his funeral.
Bill and this man are heros and people we should be paying respects to. So Carol sorry for your loss, but also be glad that like my father your life was enriched by meeting a man like this.
Robert F, Gordan Brown deserved the tacky handling…
my apologies for our neophyte President’s tacky handling of the visit of your Prime Minister.
No need. Gordon Brown is a loathesome creature, dishonest, profligate, cowardly, dictatorial and desperately dull.
BRAVO! Find the producer at the history channel, Americans have our “fly Girls” we need a TV program on those “Spitfire Girls”. Apparently the BBC can’t find its character as its currently chock full of idiots.

As the diminishing number of real heroes of troubled times pass into the night, with our grateful thanks for what they did, they may be sadly forgotten by some but were always unknown to many. It is inevitable therefore that the media casts round for any old flash-and-bash “star” to moon over – or moan over.
Fifteen minutes of fame indeed, but thanks to the likes of Bill Leith we are relatively free to allow our media whores to chase these fifteen-minuters.
Sadly we are facing yet more troubled times, and it might not be so easy to find the heroes who will stand up to the islamists and the squanderers and the eco-wingnuts. But let’s hope they emerge soon.
At least, Bill Leith will not be forgotten at the NATO Tiger meet”, having his peers reconaissance is more rewardful.

I knew that the Brits had a spine of steel. First was the British MP representative to the EU and now Mr. Leith. Maybe the rest of Great Britain will wake up to the realization of the trouble they and the rest of the world are in.
#12 “I am looking for the French and German governments to rescue us” Daniel Hannan
got to think that not all the Brits are lucid
Jane Goody was no hero, on any level. Name one thing she did because it was the right thing to do when there were no cameras around.
Bill Leith, on the other hand, is the absolute definition of a hero. He was selfless, he worked hard and sacrificed for something larger than himself. He realized it was not all about him.
David H. and Mary Jackson: I don’t feel bad about the One’s treatment of your PM, but the “presents” he gave to Queen Elizabeth (junk from the airport duty-free shop)- now that’s embarrassing, especially since she treated him much more generously than he deserves. It’s like getting a Mercedes from your uncle for Christmas and giving him a gift-wrapped Kit-Kat bar in return, when you both know you could have done a bit better than that.

Hi, Corbin.
No, Ms. Goody wasn’t always an ideal role model, but toward the end of her life, she did use her celebrity to help her fellow countrywomen, and to help look after her children. I think she handled her circumstances to the best of her ability, and there is something to be said for that.
That being said, Mr. Leith lived one hell of a life, and deserves to be recognized for it.
May both Ms. Goody and Mr. Leith rest in peace.: $139 -

As part of a plan to re-invest over £50m on relocations and property enhancements in 2017, work recently began on one of the biggest projects that we have ever undertaken – the relocation of BMW and MINI Sheffield.
Currently situated in the heart of the city, Sytner Sheffield BMW is one of our oldest and smallest dealerships but, early in 2017, the business shall relocate to a new facility which will not only be the largest within the Sytner group but also the largest BMW dealership in the UK. Located just one mile from the fantastic Meadowhall shopping centre, the new facility will allow us to offer customers an incredibly special experience each and every time that they visit the dealership.
Boasting over 200,000sq ft of indoor space, the vast 3-storey dealership will become the new home of both BMW and MINI in Sheffield. Within the building, customers will be able to explore the stunning range of cars on offer within the 150 car BMW showroom and the 50 car MINI showroom.
Whilst exploring the incredible showroom spaces on offer, our friendly and knowledgeable Sales & Genius teams will be around to help provide customers with all of the information and advice that you could ever need when discovering the fantastic cars available from both brands.
For those customers who are visiting for aftersales services, a personal welcome, out of the weather, in the new 4-lane Drive-in Service Reception area is just the beginning. With their car quickly signed in, customers shall be guided into a stunning service waiting area in which they will be able to take advantage of free WiFi, delicious hot beverages and freshly made snack from the 'Isetta Bar' cafe - all of which will be provided by the dedicated hospitality team.
As well as a 30 bay workshop with three MOT test bays, Sytner Sheffield will also benefit a state-of-the-art bodyshop; all of which will be fitted with all of the latest tools and equipment to ensure that our highly skilled BMW and MINI technicians can offer not only the best service possible but also a large increase in the number of booking slots available to our customers.
In addition to our continuous efforts in delivering the very best customer service available, we at Sytner Group are also incredibly passionate about the people that work for us – managing to achieve ‘Sunday Times Best Company to Work For’ status for seven years in a row. To help us to continue to maintain and improve this performance, facilities for our team members have been carefully planned to create an outstanding working environment. This new Sytner development allows us to not only retain over 170 careers within BMW and MINI but also creates an opportunity to increase the number of staff at the dealership dramatically, with a further 20 jobs and a host of graduate and trainee opportunities expected to be created in the coming months after opening.

Be sure to stay at Pete's place…you will not be disappointed. Counting down the days to our return!
Truly, Jim & Elene
A very spacious home situated with unparalleled views of the Santa Rosa mountains and Borrego Badlands. Very peaceful location while allowing access to the amenities of Rams Hill (swimming and golf).
Beautiful grounds and a shaded walkway with a well placed table for breakfast or dinner to the sounds of the birds. Most of all it is a very comfortable house to live in. The owners are very responsive.
The home is beautiful and spacious as are the grounds and views. My only suggestion would be that certain items should be listed as NOT PROVIDED: wash cloths, bath mats, kitchen towels (only paper), and kleenex. Also the dish soap container was almost empty.
The single bed listed in the master bedroom is really a blow-up mattress. The "pullout couch" in one of the other bedrooms is not a pullout, just a couch.
We only used the jacuzzi one time and enjoyed it even though the temp rose to only 95.
The beds are very comfortable; the bathrooms are spacious; the dining areas are great: kitchen, diningroom and outdoors! Lots and lots of space. Would return again with family.
Our stay in Boreego Springs was amazing! The home was so much more than I could have dreamed. The area breathtaking. Totally LOVED it! Everything needed was supplied and then some! Highly recommend this home and location.
We really enjoyed our time at this rental property. The pictures on the web are good, but in reality, it is even more beautiful! The house was clean, and the garden well manicured. The kitchen is well stocked with dishes pots and pans of every size, spices, and condiments in the fridge, and plenty of counter space to work on to prepare Thanksgiving Dinner. The home is very roomy, all the bedrooms were large, and having 3.5 bathrooms was a plus too. We had lots of fun playing bocce ball, ping-pong, tennis and golf, and water basketball in the pool. Even playing the piano was a treat. Relaxing in the hot tub was a big deal too. We especially enjoyed sitting out on the patio at night, and just star-gazing. So Peaceful! This was a wonderful mini-vacation for us, and daughter, son-in-law, and 6 yr. old granddaughter. There was something fun for everyone! We would definitely recommend this rental property. Thanks Peter for sharing your lovely home.
A beautiful house in the Rams Hill development in Borrego Springs was the setting for a gathering of old friends who like to hike, play golf, play board games, and laugh loads. There were 6 of us who stayed 3 nights. Although we slept comfortably and there were 4 bathrooms, there were only 3 bedrooms, and that should have been disclosed more prominently in the listing. There was a nice pool, but, unfortunately, it was not heated. The kitchen was nice sized and more than adequate for our needs. It worked out fine and we had a great time. The house was clean and well-maintained. No hesitation in recommending.

Hi John, a beautiful image for the season. I keep forgetting to say that I bought your book a few months back and I am thoroughly enjoying all those magnificent photos. Thank you!
Awesome image John!

An amazing shot John. Although we are around 0 degrees celsius the rivers are still running OK from what I have seen.
brrrrr
Beautiful photo and I hope it melts soon too John!Nova is a Marvel character. That’s all I know about the fellow.
Phoenix Wright? He’s a lawyer from a series of awesome adventure games. The Ace Attorney franchise is on one of my all time favorite franchises, so it’s awesome to see him in a game like Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3. He may not be the usual fighter, but Capcom made it work.
Nova seems alright in his own way. Like I said, I have no idea who he is so I don’t know how faithful he is to his comic book origins. But knowing Capcom, I’m going to say he turned out fine.BY: Nicholas Malofy
First and foremost, I am proudly Canadian and I fully expect the gold medal to be coming home to Canada. The reason I chose to write up about Team Finland is simple: Former Habs captain Saku Koivu has long been my favorite NHL player.
Finland has been a force in the past two Olympics, ending up with a silver medal in 2006 and a bronze in 2010. The strength of the Finnish program is goaltending. While Canada is trying to figure out who will be more consistent between Carey Price and Corey Crawford, Finland is trying to figure out which all-star to leave OFF the roster. Good goaltending can help a bad team win games. This is good because Finland has an aging roster that is short on top-level talent, especially on defense.
Goaltending
Pekka Rinne (starter)
Tuukka Rask
Anti Niemi (3rd)
With incumbent starter Mikka Kiprusoff retiring, the reins have been passed to All-Star and two-time (arguably should have been three-time) Vezina trophy candidate Pekka Rinne. Tuukka Rask is coming off a defining playoff run and Antti Niemi has won a Stanley Cup in Chicago and was a Vezina nominee for his play this year in San Jose. Kari Lehtonen is a former 2nd overall draft pick and star for the Dallas Stars, but does not boast the talent and resume to make this squad. Barring injury to one of the top three, Lehtonen is watching from home, along with Minnesota Wild standout Niklas Backstrom.
Grade: A+
Defense
Kimmo Timonen — Sami Salo
Joni Pitkanen — Toni Lydman
Sami Lepisto — Sami Vatanen
Ossi Väänänen (scratch)
This group is old. Timonen and Salo are both 38 years old, but both still posess puck-moving skills to lead the power-play (Timonen) and a cannon point shot accessorize it (Salo). Lydman is an elite shutdown defender, but is also 35 years old. Sami Lepisto makes the team based on his past experience, but is currently playing in the KHL. Sami Vatanen (Anaheim Ducks prospect) is an up-and-coming NHL player who should break camp with the Ducks this upcoming season and will be a part of Finlands future. Olli Maata (Pittsburgh Penguins prospect) has a bright future, but at 19 will not be a part of this team. OssiVäänänen is a well-regarded veteran and will be on the squad to provide depth.
Grade: C
Forwards
Valterri Filppula — Mikko Koivu — Mikael Granlund
Tuomo Ruutu — Saku Koivu — Teemu Selanne
Lori Korpikoski — Olli Jokinen — Ville Leino
Antti Miettinen — Sean Bergenheim — Jussi Jokinen
Teemu Hartikainen, Jori Lehtera (scratches)
Up-front, this squad is led by the brothers Koivu (Mikko is my choice for captain, Saku an assistant), the ageless TeemuSelanne and Detroit Red Wings stalwart ValterriFilppula. After that, the talent level thins out considerably. This is a veteran group through and through, as Saku is 38 years old, Selanne is 42 and Olli Jokinen is 34. Most of the core players are at or around 30 years of age. Granlund and Hartikainen (20 and 22 respectively) will provide the youth.
The top line of Filppula/Koivu/Granlund boasts two potential line-mates from Minnesota playing together. If they develop a chemistry together during the regular season, that should theoretically carry over to the Olympics. Saku Koivu and Teemu Selanne have played together in Olympics past and currently play together with the Anaheim Ducks. Tuomo Ruutu provides a physical presence on that line. The third line consists of veteran sniper Olli Jokinen, with two-way Phoenix Coyote Lori Korpikoski and the gritty Ville Leino. The checking line should be able to shut down teams on the penalty kill, with proven grinders Miettinen and Jussi Jokinen paired up with Florida Panther Sean Bergenheim. This line can also put the puck in the net. Teemu Hartikainen is a top-prospect with the Edmonton Oilers and pairs up with top KHL player Jori Lehtera (52 games, 17 goals, 48 pts) to provide depth. While Sasha Barkov is expected to be drafted in the top 5 of the 2013 NHL draft, I do not see him making the team this year barring a Sidney Crosby-esque start to his NHL career.
Grade: C
Prediction
Finland has the goaltending depth to steal another medal. While they lack the firepower to compete with power-houses Canada, Russia and the United States, this has always been the case for them. Finland has enough two-way forwards to make up for the lack of depth on defence. Age will be a factor, as will health. Sami Salo, Joni Pitkanen, Saku and Mikko Koivu and Tuomo Ruutu have been injury prone in the past and losing any of these players to injury around Olympic time will be a hard blow to overcome.
Group B consists of Finland, Canada, Austria and Norway. Canada and Finland advance.
Finland rides hot goaltending to make another appearance in the medal round but lacks the offensive firepower to upset the United States. Canada and Russia meet for the gold.

The date? A mere six days’ time: December 21. Time to stock up on the baked beans, then? Not quite. To worry that the world will end next Friday would be to misunderstand these ancient people. The Maya, unlike their contemporaries in Christian Europe, did not live under the shadow of apocalypse.
Their conception of the immensity of time was precocious: an inscription on a temple in the great city of Palenque discusses events that are scheduled to take place in the year AD 4772. The cycles of the Maya calendar, far from ending in 2012, are destined instead to revolve for eons.
Why, then, the current hysteria? In part it springs from the cosmological context. Bad news was being veiled behind a recitation of numerals. British Chancellor of the Exchequer would surely have approved.
The attempt to make sense of the vanished civilisation of the Maya, and to give back to it its silenced voice, has been one of the great projects of Mesoamerican scholarship, and offers one further clue to the roots of the 2012 panic.
When European archaeologists were first venturing into the Yucatan in the 19th century, many of them found it impossible to accept that the monumental architecture they were finding could possibly have been built by indigenous people.
The existence of pyramids and hieroglyphs seemed to suggest settlers from Egypt — or perhaps from Atlantis. Erich von Daniken argued from their own fears, desires and aspirations.
By arrangement with the GuardianThe Tennessean first reported the decision Wednesday evening and ESPN.com confirmed with sources Thursday.
The decision means Locker, who missed 25 games in three seasons because of injuries, will be playing for his future in Tennessee this season
The price tag to pick up the option was about $14.6 million, according to The Tennessean. Locker, who was the eighth overall pick of the 2011 NFL Draft, is scheduled to make $2.091 million this season.
The deadline for teams to pick up the fifth-year option for players from the 2011 draft is Saturday.
Locker is still expected to be the starter for the Titans in their first season under head coach Ken Whisenhunt.
Locker is recovering from surgery on his foot that ended his 2013 season in November. He has an 8-10 record in his career as a starter. He threw for 1,256 yards with eight touchdowns and four interceptions in seven games last season.About the Book.

environmental justice = Racism!
More out of control government. Why does DHS need to open an “environmental justice” unit?
Fundamental Change is here.
Thought Police.
Department of Pre Crime ?
And Being Green is a national security issue under the Dept. of Homeland Security because...???
Now we’re gonna have “Green Shirts” instead of “Brown Shirts” like the Nazis to enforce Party policy and quell dissent?
Be afraid, be very afraid.
Moreover how do they do this without Congressional approval.
We need to aboliash this department ASAP.
What kind of environmental justice is it to jack up prices for energy for the poor?
This is where you can see that Obama does not need Congress.
So far, he is getting away with using executive orders, czars, and regulators.
No one will stop him. If he wins again, we will have a full blown dictatorship.
He is actually getting away with eliminating the middlemen.
He is also trying to eliminate the powers of the Supreme Court.

I love these satire pieces.
Yeah... and get rid of them as well..
Wow, could their actions been any more contrary to their law? I guess burning human bodies wasn’t air pollution. And experimenting on humans wasn’t as bad as experimenting on animals. Of course they had a different definition of “human”.
Rhetorical question, I hope.
Control & intimidation. Make the people fearful in every aspect of their lives and you get a docile and subservient populace.

While arrogance in any form or measure is equal parts narcicism and ignorance, Prezzadint Barrio Bummer has redefined just how venally consumed with it any one person can be. The chance exists, despite the mountain empirical evidence to the contrary, that our "president" [sic] actually believes that he is the smartest person in the room at any given moment. But when any churlish, petulant, self-absorbed navel-gazer needs a podium, mirophone, and two teleprompters to address a small classroom of 5th-grade school children, even the least observant or insightful among us has to wonder if they aren't watching a moron of rare and crippling philistinism.
This jigging rump-clown will go down in history as the single-most ridiculous imbecile ever to hold the highest office in the land. The brazenly pandemic media complicity needed to escort this ignoramus past the public and its gatekeeprs into the Oval Office is a badge of shame that will take decades for the Fourth Estate to be scrubbed of the stain from, if ever.
The next President and Congress are going to spend the first year in office undoing all the Anti-American garbage this putz has left in his putrid wake.
From the DHS website:
It’s getting uglier by the day.
Someone please tell me this is satire.

Globalization results in connecting people all around the world. The increasing access to and continuous use of technology has radically impacted the way in which people communicate and conduct their daily lives. The internet connects people and companies from opposite sides of the world fast, easily, and relatively economically. Nevertheless, the internet and computer can pose some threats which can have disparaging impact on civilisations. Cybercrime is a hazard against different organisations and people whose computers are connected to the internet and particularly mobile technology.
Cybercrime is a dangerous crime involving computers or digital devices, in which a computer can be either a target of the crime, a tool of the crime or contain evidence of the crime. Cybercrime basically defined as any criminal activity that occurs over the Internet. There are many examples such as fraud, malware such as viruses, identity theft and cyber stalking. In present environment, since most information processing depends on the use of information technology, the control, prevention and investigation of cyber activities is vital to the success of the Organizations, Government's agencies and individuals. The procurement and maintenance of highly skill cybercrime expert by Government and Business Enterprises cannot be exaggerated.
Earlier, cybercrime was committed mainly by individuals or small groups. Presently, it is observed that there is highly complex cybercriminal networks bring together individuals at global level in real time to commit crimes.
Today, criminals that indulge in cybercrimes are not motivated by ego or expertise. Instead, they want to use their knowledge to gain profits promptly. They are using their capability to snip, deceive and exploit people as they find it easy to generate money without having to do an honest work. Cybercrimes have become major threat today.
Cybercrimes are broadly categorized into three groups such as crime against
This type of cybercrime can be in the form of cyber stalking, distributing pornography, trafficking and "grooming". In present situation, law enforcement agencies are considering such cybercrime very serious and are joining forces worldwide to reach and arrest the committers.
Same as in the real world where a criminal can steal and pickpocket, even in the cyber world, offenders resort to stealing and robbing. In this case, they can steal a person's bank details and drain off money; misuse the credit card to make frequent purchases online; run a scam to get naive people to part with their hard earned money; use malicious software to gain access to an organization's website or disrupt the systems of the organization. The malicious software can also damage software and hardware, just like vandals damage property in the offline world.
Crimes against a government are denoted to as cyber terrorism. If criminals are successful, it can cause devastation and panic amongst the citizen. In this class, criminals hack government websites, military websites or circulate propaganda. The committers can be terrorist outfits or unfriendly governments of other nations.
In this category, a person's computer is broken into so that his personal or sensitive information can be accessed. In the United States, hacking is categorized as a wrongdoing. Many crackers also try to gain access to resources through the use of password cracking soft wares. Hackers can also monitor what users do on their computer and can also import files on their computer. A hacker could install several programs on to their system without their knowledge. Such programs could also be used to steal personal information such as passwords and credit card information.
This type of cybercrime occurs when a person violates copyrights and downloads music, movies, games and software. There are even peer sharing websites which encourage software piracy and many of these websites are now being targeted by the FBI. Nowadays, the justice system is addressing this cybercrime and there are laws that avert people from unlawful downloading.
This is a type of online harassment wherein the victim is endangered to a barrage of online messages and emails. Normally, these stalkers know their victims and instead of resorting to offline stalking, they use the Internet to stalk. However, if they notice that cyber stalking is not having the desired effect, they begin offline stalking along with cyber stalking to make the victims' lives more dejected.
This is a major problem with people using the Internet for cash transactions and banking services. In this cybercrime, a criminal accesses data about a person's bank account, credit cards, Social Security, debit card, full name and other sensitive information to drain off money or to buy things online in the victim's name. The identity thief can use person's information to fraudulently apply for credit, file taxes, or get medical services. It can result in major financial losses for the victim and even spoil the victim's credit history.
This software, also called computer virus is Internet-based software or programs that are used to disrupt a network. The software is used to gain access to a system to gather sensitive information or data or causing damage to software present in the system.
This is also a type of cybercrime in which criminals solicit minors via chat rooms for the purpose of child pornography. The FBI has been spending a lot of time monitoring chat rooms visited by children in order to reduce and prevent child abuse and soliciting.
Virus dissemination: Malicious software that attaches itself to other software. (virus, worms, Trojan Horse, web jacking, e-mail bombing etc.).
It is a type of cybercrime that Damages or destroys data rather than stealing. It transmits virus.
Cyber terrorism: It is a use of Internet based attacks in terrorist activities. Technology savvy terrorists are using 512-bit encryption, which is impossible to decrypt.
Software piracy: It is a theft of software through the illegal copying of genuine programs. Distribution of products intended to pass for the original.. Software piracy is often labelled as soft lifting, counterfeiting, Internet piracy, hard-disk loading, OEM unbundling, and unauthorized renting.
Denial of service attacks: This crime is committed by the criminal, who floods the bandwidth of the victim's network or fills his e-mail box with spam mail depriving him of the services he is entitled to access.
Figure: Elements to protect from cyber crime
Computer users can adopt various techniques to prevent cybercrime.
- Computer users must use a firewall to protect their computer from hackers. Most security software comes with a firewall. Turn on the firewall that comes with their router as well.
- Computer users are recommended to purchase and install anti-virus software such as McAfee or Norton Anti-Virus. AVG offers free anti-virus protection if they do not want to purchase software.
- It is advised by cyber experts that users must shop only at secure websites. Look for a Truste or VeriSign seal when checking out. They should never give their credit card information to a website that looks suspicious or to strangers.
- Users must develop strong passwords on their accounts that are difficult to guess. Include both letters and numerals in their passwords. They must continuously update passwords and login details. By changing login details, at least once or twice a month, there are less chances of being a target of cybercrime.
- It is suggested to monitor children and how they use the Internet. Install parental control software to limit where they can surf.
- Make sure that social networking profiles such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, MSN are set to private. Check their security settings and be careful what information users post online. Once it is on the Internet, it is extremely difficult to remove.
- Secure mobile devices. More often than not, people leave their mobile devices unattended. By activating the built-in security features, they can avoid any access to personal details. Never store passwords, pin numbers and even own address on any mobile device.
- Protect Data to avoid criminals to hack. Use encryption for most sensitive files such as tax returns or financial records, make regular back-ups of all important data, and store it in a different location.
- Users must be alert while using public Wi-Fi Hotspots. While these access points are convenient, they are far from secure. Avoid conducting financial or corporate transactions on these networks.
- Protect e-identity. Users must be careful when giving out personal information such as name, address, phone number or financial information on the Internet. Make sure that websites are secure.
- Avoid being scammed: It is suggested that users must assess and think before they click on a link or file of unknown origin. Do not open any emails in inbox. Check the source of the message. If there is a doubt, verify the source. Never reply to emails that ask them to verify information or confirm their user ID or password.
In brief, Cybercrime is evolving as a serious threat. A cyber-attack is an attack originated from a computer against a website, computer system or individual computer that compromises the confidentiality, integrity or availability of the computer or information stored on it. It is major and perhaps the most complicated problem in the cyber domain. Worldwide governments, police departments and intelligence units have begun to react against cybercrime. Many efforts are being taken at international level to curb cross border cyber threats. Indian police has started special cyber cells across the country and have started educating the peoples so that they gain knowledge and protect themselves from such crime.Kansas City Computer Repair at a New Prestigious Location
When we think of Briarcliff Village we think of an exclusive shopping and dining destination, with a reputation for quality and service. The Shopping center has a variety of tenants, Right now you can find a fabulous organic grocer, a stylish salon, chic day spa, scrumptious restaurants, delicious coffee, some of the most exclusive boutiques for women, and opening in 2014 a savvy computer retail store. Kansas City computer repair shops can be a bit of a bore, they all look the same, and there isn’t much to do when your repair will only take a minute besides flip through old tech magazines. Now that KC Computer Support is opening their retail/computer drop off store in the fabulous tuscan style Briarcliff Village, Computer services will be taken to whole new level.
With this new convenient location just 5 minutes from downtown & Parkville and two from Riverside, KC Computer Support will be able to better serve their clients with an easy to find location and a retail store to satisfy all needs for new computers, accessories, and continue to provide the same quality service that has earned this company its loyal customer base and reputable name.
KC Computer Support has specialized in technology services for the home, home office and small businesses since its start in 2008.

The company’s service area covers eleven counties and extends from St. Joseph to Spring Hill, and Blue Springs to Leavenworth. Recognized by Kansas City Mayor Mark Funkhouser as a “Small Business Success” and winning Angie’s List Super Service Award two years in a row has given them great pride, but pushed them to further develop their services, customer service, and knowledge and stay ahead of the competition and themselves. With only eight members, this company has been able to truly specialize on Small Business Tech, with five of its employees being certified as Microsoft Small Business Specialists.
Their services will continue to be the same, they will now have a location at which you can drop off your computer for service, or shop for a new one at a prestigious shopping center with exclusive shops and products.
The new location will be right beside Green Acres Market on Mulberry Dr. and will be open after the 1st of the new year.
We look forward to the grand opening, and now KC Computer tech is even closer to home with new products and convenient service location for all of us in the Northland.

Robin Hood Radio Tries To Save Local Community Radio

You can get away with yellow/red highlights (i.e. setting sun sky) at +2 2/3 stops because the yellow layer seems to go on and on...
On the negative film side you can't go wrong with Portra 160 or 400... they scan beautifully and you won't need any grads. Just expose the darkest shadow you need to be non-black at -2 stops.
I've only just started liking Ektar but do not underexpose - I would place shadows at -1 if possible.

Abstract
Identifying materials with intrinsically high thermoelectric performance remains a challenge even with the aid of a high-throughput search. Here, using a chemically intuitive approach based on the bond-orbital theory, three anisotropic 2D group-V materials (monolayer black phosphorus, α-arsenene, and aW-antimonene) are identified as candidates for high thermoelectric energy conversion efficiency. Concepts, such as bond length, bond angle, and bond strength, are used to explain the trends in their electronic properties, such as the band gap and the effective mass. Our first principles calculations confirm that high carrier mobilities and large Seebeck coefficients can be obtained at the same time in these materials, due to complex Fermi surfaces originating from the anisotropic structures. An intuitive understanding of how the bonding character affects phonon transport is also provided with emphasis on the importance of bonding strength and bond anharmonicity. High thermoelectric performance is observed in these materials. Our approach provides a powerful tool to identify new thermoelectric materials and evaluate their transport properties.This Classified is Closed

Be on the lookout for his collaborative album, Unit 6, with JMSN to drop later this year. Watch the full interview above.
Watch NowSometimes it is needed to change an image into another image, if possible with a smooth transiction. There are a lot of solution to the problem, but one of the simpliest approach is using the background of a containing div. Here is a possible and really raw solution
(function($) { $.fn.transictionto = function(options) { var settings = $.extend({ }, options || {}); //wrap into div if no div is present. $(this).each(function() { if ($(this).parent('div').size() == 0) { $(this).wrap('<div></div>') } //now swap with background trick $(this) .parent() .css('background-image', 'url(' + settings.destinationImage + ')') .css('background-repeat', 'no-repeat') .end() .fadeOut(1000, function() { this.src = settings.destinationImage; $(this).show(); }); }); }; })(jQuery);
the code is really simple, first of all if the image is not contained in a div I wrap it into a div. This can change a little the layout of the page, so I suggest for every image that need to be swapped with another image to be originally enclosed in a div to make the transition happens. Next I set the new image as the div background, set the background-repeat to â€œno repeatâ€, then fade out the original image. When the original image fades out it slowly merge with the new image into the background. Finally when the fading out is completed I change the source of the image and finally show the image again.
You can use this plugin with great easy.
<script type="text/javascript"> $(function() { $('input').click(function() { $('img').transictionto({ destinationImage: '/Images/photo2.jpg' }); }); }); </script> </head> <body> <img src="../Images/photo1.jpg" /> <div style="float: left;"> <img src="../Images/photo3.jpg" /></div> <input type="button" value="PressMe" /> </body> </html>
This page contains only two images, the first is not enclosed in a div. It contains a simple button and thanks to jQuery I make a call to trasictionto plugin for each image in the page. The result is that both images gracefully transiction to destination image :D. It is amazing how jQuery can accomplish such a beautiful task in few lines of code.

Welcome to part four of our discussion about courage, inspired by Gus Lee’s wonderful book titled Courage: The Backbone Of Leadership.
I’ve been thinking about Gus’s analysis of courageous leadership in light of Jesus’ model for us. Entire books have been written about Jesus’ leadership. My goal is to list a few attributes of courageous leadership that are apparent in His life.
* Courageous leaders act for what’s right, regardless of risk.
* Courageous leaders resist short-term temptation. They make decisions from a long-term perspective.
* Courageous leaders demonstrate integrity. Their actions and decisions match their words.
* Courageous leaders confront problems. They don’t take the easy path.
* Courageous leaders stand firm in their principles under pressure.
* Courageous leaders motivate “by ethically modeling, and inspiring others to be, their best selves and to act courageously for what is right.” (Gus Lee)
As a follower of Jesus, I want to lead in my circles of influence according to His example. These seem like a good start.
What did I miss? What other attributes of courageous leadership do you see in Jesus?
Leadership is character and competence. If you can have only one, opt for character. H. Norman Schwarzkopf

Sorry there are no upcoming showtimes for The Night Is Young (Mauvais sang)Even with the lackluster play of my favorite team last night, I decided to try and think positively.
What could I do?
Well, this particular game where nothing was falling in for the Cubs, nobody could get past second base, the pitching was sub-par, and the fielding and baserunning were pretty shoddy, I realized that the Cubs had given me gas.
Actually, a whole wonderful body full of gas.
And I thought “if only the Cubs were at Wrigley tonight, I could help with some timely wind.”
Because you know, that’s one of the main reasons the Cubs can’t seem to hit homers this year, the no-wind thing.
And I thought, perhaps you’re feeling a little gassy yourself, Cub Fan, with this recent play.
Perhaps there are 41,000 Cub Fans out there with the exact same condition – why we could all go to Wrigley and get that flag blowing straight out and just watch the homers land on Waveland and Sheffield!
Just a thought.
Okay, the Cubs lose 6-1 and have dropped 6 of their last 10, yet remain impossibly tied for first place.
Tonight Carlos Zambrano can redeem himself and hopefully get back to being Carlos, and maybe the Cubs can beat the 62 and 79 Pirates.
Go Cubs.
Please do not make me follow through on my plan, guys.The latest edition of GP Update features stories on water restrictions, upcoming Homeownership Fair, "Red, White and Blue" animal adoption special, Guns and Hoses charity baseball game, the new Waggin' Wagon mobile adoption trailer, and mosquito spraying.

USGS, Reston VA
USGS, Denver CO
USGS, Menlo Park CA
The National Research Program (NRP) conducts basic and long-term research that integrates hydrological, geological, chemical, climatological, and biological information related to water resources and environmental problems. Relevant hydrologic information provided by the USGS is available today to assist the Nation in solving its water problems because of a conscious decision made in years past to invest in research. Researchers in the National Research Program focus both on (1) the study and application of hydrologic principles to particular geographic settings or water-resources problems, and (2) on fundamental research addressing hydrologic processes and principles that are related to broad geographic areas or problems. The combination of approaches is essential to the development of scientific understanding and the application of results to problems related to the use and preservation of the Nation's water resources, both of which help the USGS and the U.S. Department of the Interior perform their public missions.
Results of hydrologic research by scientists in this program have provided much of the scientific basis that has enabled the USGS to tackle and resolve complex hydrologic problems. The new information, theories, techniques, and tools developed within the program are used not only by USGS scientists and managers, but also by the members of the hydrologic community outside the USGS, both nationally and internationally, and by the public. The NRP makes a deliberate effort to anticipate research needs that will be pertinent to hydrologic science issues of the future. Thus, the emphasis of NRP research activities changes through time, reflecting the emergence of needed new areas of inquiry and the demand for new tools and techniques with which to address water-resources issues and problems. Through the years, many of the Geological Survey's major research and resource assessment initiatives related to existing and emerging national water-resources problems had their origins in the NRP.
In addition to the generally long-term research studies conducted as part of the centrally-coordinated NRP, the USGS conducts other hydrologic research studies throughout the United States. Information related to these research studies and other water resources activities of the USGS is arranged by state. USGS also provides partial support for the State Water Resources Research Institutes, including management of a competitive grants program as authorized under the Water Resources Research Act.
The National Research Program had its beginnings in the late 1950s. Since that time the program has grown to encompass a broad spectrum of scientific research. The sciences of hydrology, mathematics, chemistry, physics, ecology, biology and engineering are used to gain a fundamental understanding of the processes that affect the availability, movement, and quality of the Nation's water resources. Results of the NRP's long-term research investigations often lead to the development of new concepts, techniques, and approaches that are applicable not only to the solution of current water problems, but also future issues that may affect the Nations's water resources. Basic tools that have been developed by the NRP include groundwater modeling, geochemical modeling, watershed modeling, and regional flood frequency analysis. Additional information about the NRP is provided by a fact sheet published in 2005: The National Research Program in the Hydrological Sciences

Last Modified: Thursday, November 29, 2012 4:22 PM
By Scooter Hobbs / American PressBATON ROUGE — LSU’s Les Miles isn’t going anywhere.
But he is getting a raise and a contract extension to stay with the Tigers.
The LSU head football coach said Wednesday that the extension was for seven years, and that the school will release financial details at a later date after they are finalized.
“This Miles family is very comfortable in south Louisiana,” Miles said.
The new contract came after 24 hours of speculation that Arkansas was offering Miles a substantial raise — reportedly $27.5 million for five years.
Miles’ current contract pays him $3.75 million per year.
LSU Athletic Director Joe Alleva said the Arkansas rumors were not a factor in the extension and raise, except maybe for the timing.
“It has been my plan all along to give coach a raise and an extension, and that’s what we’re doing,” Alleva said, adding that he had planned to get the new contract done after LSU’s bowl game.
Miles said the Arkansas offer was “a sincere one,” but that “the view of five years and $27 million is not true.”
“Our conversations were very preliminary and fell short of any major interest,” he said.
Miles said he did not speak with Jerry Jones, the Dallas Cowboys’ owner and Arkansas alum who was reportedly involved in Arkansas’ wooing of him.
Miles spent three years as an assistant coach with the Cowboys and knows Jones well. But he said whatever interest he had in Arkansas involved Razorbacks’ Athletic Director Jeff Long, a longtime friend from when both began their careers at Michigan.
Miles also would not comment on the financial aspects of the new contract, although it will eventually be public record.
“It’s embarrassing to me to talk about money, so I don’t,” Miles said. “I’m just thankful that I’m fortunate enough to have an occupation that pays a tremendous market value.
“Four (teenage) children headed to college, I needed a raise.”
Alleva said Miles has not received a raise since his contract was reworked after the 2007 national championship season. His contract was also renegotiated after the 2010 season, when Miles had an offer to return to his alma mater at Michigan, but that did not involve a monetary increase in salary.
Miles is 85-20 in his eighth year at LSU, the fifth-best winning percentage (.810) in Southeastern Conference history. He has led LSU to four top-five national finishes, including the 2007 national championship, along with SEC championships in 2007 and 2011.
For the last two years, LSU has also finished second in the SEC to Vanderbilt in the NCAA’s Graduation Success Rate formula.
“What I want to do is win championships here and do it again, and then do it again,” Miles said.
He said he looked forward to the four-team playoff college football will go to for 2014 season.
‘Somebody makes their way through that gauntlet to the end, that would be a great challenge,” he said. “That challenge can be met right here.”

And, don't forget the price of LSU football tickets was increased the last time Miles got a raise in order to fund it.

Title: A Raise
I agree with Claude...........if he is willing to leave a job that all ready pays him almost 4 million a year..........they should have let him go.............I bet that doesn't figure to be the 1% raise that I and most of America got this year and will get next year, if we get that..................complete crap............I won't watch LSU anymore.

Title: miles is a clown and a manipulator
he has best talent in nation and cannot get it done.......he won a national championship in a year when his team lost 2 regular season games so what is so special about this loser............why did he not recruit johnny football manziel but instead recruited tyran Mathieu and Jordan Jefferson.........let him go to arkansas

Title: A raise?!
They should have let him go to Arkansas. I do understand about him needing a raise. How can anyone support 4 children on only $3.75 million per year?

AbstractMethiocarb [4-(methylthio)-3,-5-xylyl N-methylcarbamate] was tested as a seed treatment for repelling blackbirds and crows (Corvus sp.) from sprouting corn in South Carolina. The test was conducted on eight fields within a 0.25-square-mile area. Marked repellency occurred; sprout damage averaged 44 percent in the control fields and 0.3 percent in the fields treated with methiocarb.

Tweaking the name to Q’Viva! The Choice, the show seeks out the best Latin America music performers “from remote villages to major cities.” (Truly, if you know how to sing, no matter where you are, a reality show is going to find you!). The ambitious project will be shot in three languages and “broadcast simultaneously across 21 countries.” BlackBerry has signed on to sponsor the show.
Of course, anybody can announce a TV series; it’s not real until there’s a network on board. Sources tell EW the Q’Viva! team already has a couple foreign distributors, but still needs to find a domestic partner.

Just south of Long Island in New York lies a popular vacation spot called Fire Island. Though it's not an exclusive resort, it's popular getaway for members of the gay and lesbian communities (though certainly not exclusive). It's about as close to paradise as one can imagine, and a virtual safe haven for individuals that may not always be accepted by society. Much like gathering areas for other groups with similar interests and backgrounds, Fire Island provides a very unique atmosphere that brings in thousands of guests each year.
Shot on location, the aptly named Fire Island was a reality-based documentary/reality show created by John Cadwell and Tim Curran. Originally appearing on the Bravo Network, four episodes of the show aired back in 1999. Basically, the show follows several groups of gay and lesbian "tourists" during their stays at the popular vacation spot---including all the ups and downs that occur in every relationship. In the spirit of earlier shows like MTV's The Real World, it tries hard to capture these relationships through a unique vantage point, and largely succeeds. These are real people, who go through both wonderful and painful experiences, and the viewer is invited along for the ride. While love and respect are shown prominently, many terrible aspects of life are also present: the threat of HIV and AIDS, the fear of being rejected by family, and the occasional fight with a significant other. At its very core, Fire Island shows that relationships have their ups and downs, no matter who you're in love with. For that, it's a unique and interesting viewing experience.
Still, this show has its faults, the most obvious being that it shows its age more than you'd think. That's not to say that Fire Island no longer has impact, but the primary intent of the show was to shed light on homosexual lifestyles and relationships. Any way you look at it, that's simply not as "new" as it once was, even since 1999. While I still think America has a long way to go before gays and lesbians are given equal rights, this show is no longer as unique as it once was.
Moving on, there's another problem here that has absoloutely nothing to do with political hot buttons: the style in which the story is told. On occasion, it ventures into "travel brochure" territory, and seems more like a commercial for Fire Island itself than a look at it's visitors (even though some of the situations are more terrifying than enticing). Additionally, I would have liked to see more variety to the stories: although we get a good mix of couples and groups, it could have shown a much wider range of people and scenarios. There are thousands of visitors to Fire Island every year, so there have got to be many more stories.
Although I didn't want to make this a prominent point of the review, I'm not gay. However, this is not meant as a homophobic declaration, but rather an assurance that anyone can enjoy the show, regardless of your sexual preference. Sure, Fire Island is no masterpiece of modern television, but it's a well-intentioned look at an extremely significant part of our culture.
This DVD comes to us from Win Media, and collects all four episodes of Fire Island in their entirety. Although the techincal presentation isn't anything to write home about (and the extras are quite scarce), it's surprising that this show made it to DVD at all. Let's see how this one stacks up:
Fire Island is presented in its original 4:3 fullscreen format. In general, most of the outdoor scenes looked good, and exhibited a sharp image and strong colors. However, a portion of the footage wasn't up to the same level; specifically, some of the colors and textures looked a little muddy overall. While I'm sure this presentation was identical to (or slightly above) the original broadcast quality, Fire Island could have looked a little better.
Typically, not being in a show's target market can have a significant impact on your viewing enjoyment, but I found Fire Island to be a reasonably interesting look into a very unique environment. Unfortunately, the show occasionally plays out more like a travel brochure than an honest look at these couples, and this can really take the viewer out of the story. Still, if Fire Island sounds like your scene---or if you enjoyed the show on the Bravo Network---this show might be worth a look on DVD. Unfortunately, this release features an average technical presentation and minimal bonus features, so it's not really worth a blind buy.

Pozdrav :)Spectacular water fountains and rows of Azalea and Rhododendron bushes line the walkways. Just ahead is the glorious circa 1882 Linnean House, a glass, brick, and slate orangery used to overwinter citrus trees. Everything appears just as one would expect from the oldest and most prestigious botanical garden in the United States. However, science fiction movies cannot prepare first time visitors for what they are about to witness inside the gates of the Missouri Botanical Garden.
Peaking through the conifers is an enormous dome-like structure that defies description. Have aliens landed here? Is this a prototype for a lunar space station? It’s the CLIMATRON - a seven story tall geodesic greenhouse that houses a lowland tropical rainforest. This architectural marvel opened in 1960 to much fanfare including a speech by the President of the National Academy of Science.
Inside the Climatron are 1400 species of plants – palms, ferns, cycads, pineapples, mangos, figs, avocados, bananas, and orchids – all within this half acre jungle. Insect control is naturally provided by Gecko lizards, Nepenthes pitcher plants, and tropical birds. The orchids that reside in this futuristic greenhouse are primarily the smaller, overlooked species that are typically found in rainforests: Ludisia discolor with its deep maroon velvety foliage, many types of Vanilla (not just the popular edible Vanilla planifolia), diminutive bulbophyllums whose blossoms are sometimes no larger than a dime, and Prosthechea cochleata aka the &Cockleshell& orchid.
The showy orchid hybrids are reserved for the Education Building which has its own exhibit in the lobby. The vast majority of the collection is ‘timed’ for the annual orchid show which is held every February/March. Much of the garden’s 7000 plant orchid collection has been donated over many decades and is of great historic significance. Not long ago, the greenhouses and facilities were so impressive that the American Orchid Society was considering relocating their headquarters there.
Philanthropist Henry Shaw created the Missouri Botanical Garden in the mid-19th century. Shaw got the idea after visiting the grounds of Chatsworth, the formal estate of the Duke of Devonshire in England. For many years, Shaw lived on the property in a villa called Tower Grove House. Orchid hobbyists, today, are familiar with the Tower Grove variety name from many heirloom plants including the famous
albescens form of
Cattleya bowringiana ‘Tower Grove’.
The local orchid society in St Louis has a warm relationship with the garden which serves as a model for other horticultural institutions around the country. As overgrown orchid plants from the collection are periodically divided and re-potted, the extra pieces are given to the society members who ‘win’ them as raffle prizes. Not only are the members thrilled to be owning historic plants, but the garden is ensuring that these rarities live on for generations.
In 1960, the Climatron must have been quite a sensation. The garden was already over 100 years old and home to an impressive orchid collection. The new space-age structure was the perfect venue to experience the tropics. Another half century later, visitors are as awe-struck as ever.Equality
Congressman Pallone continues to fight for policies that reflect our American ideals of equality, fairness and justice, and works to ensure all Americans, regardless of race, gender, religion, sexual orientation or gender identity, are entitled to the same protections under the law.
Ending workpace discrimination
- Congressman Pallone led a letter along with 71 Members of Congress calling on President Obama to sign an executive order that would prohibit LGBT workplace discrimination by federal contractors by requiring that all contractors include sexual orientation and gender identity provisions in their non-discrimination statements.
- Congressman Pallone co-sponsored the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA), which would provide basic protections against workplace discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. ENDA extends federal employment discrimination protections already in place for race, religion, sex, national origin, age and disability to include sexual orientation and gender identity.
- Congressman Pallone co-sponsored the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act in 2009, which provides a remedy for women and men who have been victims of pay discrimination. Today women still earn only 77 cents to the dollar of a man’s wages for the same job. This was signed into law by President Obama in 2010.
Marriage equality
- Congressman Pallone was one of 67 Members to vote against the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) when it was first considered in 1996.
- Congressman Pallone co-sponsored the Respect for Marriage Act which would repeal the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) and restore the rights of all lawfully married couples, including same-sex couples, to receive the benefits of marriage under federal law.Home Buying Advice Needed!!
What is the difference when buying a home that is being sold by owner and by broker?
Is having a cosigner on a home loan the same as one on a car loan?
My hubby's credit is better then it use to be, we have been working on it the last few years to get to the point that we can get approved for a home loan. It is finally in the low 600s, not sure if we can get approved yet or not, so I thought we could have my dad co sign who has excellent credit.
Yes, a co-signor works the same way...if you can't pay the loan, your father will be responsible for paying it.

I've been gluten free since March, and got glutened by Rice Dream a bit ago which gave me headaches, made me really tired, nauseous and bloated. My main symptoms before going gluten free were bloating and constipation.
Fast forward to this week, and I'm positive I got glutened again but really can't figure out what from. Either it was from cross contamination while visiting at my parents house or something I ate that I cannot figure out. It started on Wednesday, and the only thing I can think of is that I had a few cookies from two new companies, Zena's Cookies and Ginny Bakes, but both are supposed to be gluten free.
I was visiting family out of town this week, and as I was making my 2.5 hour drive back Wednesday, I kept yawning over and over. I thought I was a little tired from helping my brother move the previous day, but as my drive back home continued, not only did I keep yawning but I started feeling really nauseous. I stopped along the side of the road and just sat for a few minutes, and was just hoping I could make it back home without getting really sick in the car. Thankfully I made it back home, but when I got upstairs I went to the bathroom and had massive D. It was completely liquefied, and that NEVER happens. Thursday and Friday I continued to feel nauseous and my stool was still loose, but not completely liquid. My stomach was also quite rumbly, and I'm still a bit bloated and my intestine area is really tender.
I didn't put two and two together until last night because I thought maybe I got food poisoning, but then I started getting bone pain last evening. I had some times of intense bone pain before gluten-free.
So I've determined I got glutened somehow, but I'm not quite sure how it happened. I've read that symptoms can change after going gluten free. I can't tell you the last time I had liquefied D because I always had C. Maybe because Rice Dream was a liquid it didn't give me as intense a reaction, but I think feeling nauseous is an indicator that I've been glutened because I never get nauseous.
It bothers me that I can't figure out what caused it, but I'll have to just let that go and hopefully the lingering effects will go away soon!
Diagnosed with celiac disease, but my fat malabsoption, EPI and Vitamin K deficiency have finally cleared themselves up do to the help from Creon!
Thankful for all the help I've received from members on this board!
Happy to have answers
It needs to be about 20% cooler.

My first thought would be that you got glutened while home. My second thought is that if you don't do oats, you probably shouldn't be eating the Ginny Bakes cookies, even if they aren't the ones that have oats in them. The reaction would likely be the same in either case (if you react to oats), but only you know when you started eating the cookies.

you say maby " cross contamination while visiting at my parents house or something" are you sure? Your parents may have accidentally cross contaminated something. Are they knowledgable at Gluten free cooking? If not I would be a lil worried about that. Hopefully you figure it out soon .. Good luck!! Hope you feel better!

Sorry that you're feeling lousy.
Those poor bacteria, getting blamed for causing food poisoning when its those darned gluten brats doing the dirty work.
I'd put those cookies on the do-not-buy list for the future, but I suppose you'll have to keep the parents.

thanks everyone! I prepared everything at my parents house that I ate with one exception, cut up watermelon. It's possible that it could have been that if the cutting board, it is a glass one, wasn't properly cleaned or if the countertop wasn't cleaned thoroughly, I got a hit from that, but honestly I think it might have been the cookies.
When I had the Rice Dream, I know for sure I got a hit from that because it was the only thing I had eaten out of the ordinary that day and I felt nauseous within 1-2 hours. I think I ate the watermelon Monday so that's what makes me skeptical about that, but I had the cookies before I made the 2.5 drive back to my house and then during the drive started to feel terrible, which makes me lean more toward the cookies. However, Zena's cookies are made in a dedicated gluten free facility and Ginny's cookies are certified gluten free, so that's what makes me skeptical saying that it was those. Adalaide, the oats are definitely another possibility.
I'm thinking not purchasing those cookies and continuing to cut up my own fruit at my parents would be a better choice from now on...
Posted 17 August 2013 - 11:36 AM 17 August 2013 - 11:58 AM
hmmm i'm not sure I do oats ok or not. I ate oatmeal at breakfast all the time before going gluten free, but after reading that oats, even certified gluten free oats weren't good to have at the beginning of the diet, I just stopped eating them.
Adalaide, am I understanding correctly that even if they are certified gluten-free oats, and even if the particular type of cookie didn't have oats in them, but were made on the same lines as a type that did, that could create a problem?
Here are the two specific types I ate:
honestly I really should just go back to eating whole foods again because that's when I felt best, and it would save me money... 18 August 2013 - 04:59 AM 18 August 2013 - 04:27 PM
thanks, Adalaide. that does make sense. I'll give the certified gluten free oats a try in the future by themselves, but I'm in no rush to test that possibility right now. my intestine area is still a little sore and bloated. Everything else seems to be getting back to normal which is good because tomorrow is the first day of a new school year. I've already got my outfit picked out that gives me some extra room in the stomach 25 August 2013 - 05:11 AM
Yay!! Hope you figured it out!!

There are many films released focusing on the topic of leadership. Movies today demonstrate arts of leadership in many aspects, such as how to motivate employees and how to become an inspirational leader. A more recent Movie that was produced is Wonder Woman, a story about how a woman with magical power defeated the evil god of war. This paper will discuss Wonder Woman and how it relates to elements of leadership.
Wonder Woman was released in 2017, and directed by Patty Jenkins, (IMDB 2017). This film mainly illustrates a story about how Princess Diana, with mysterious power, defeats evil Ares, the god of war and saves the world. Diana was born in the hidden island of Themyscira, which is completely isolated from the outside world. There, she met Steve Trevor, a spy of an American intelligence agency working with Britain. He was on a mission to find the German bioweapon. After learning Trevor’s tory, Diana decided to go with him because she was sure that the person that started the war was Ares. Then Steve, Diana, and three other men formed a team to destroy the bioweapon. At the end of the film, Diana successfully killed Ares, who was in disguise of Sir Patrick, a high-level German military officer, and saved the world from the misery of the First World War.
After watching the film, elements of leadership can be easily found in it. The main character, Princess Diana, shows a number of leadership traits. First of all, she has great charisma. This actually is a very important trait to a leader. “Successful leaders are magnetizing and charming which inspires devotion in their followers” (B. Downard, 2017). In this film, Diana has a very likable image, with great body shape, beautiful face as well as good personality. Compared to others, such a person could persuade people to follow her more easily. A great first impression can increase the chances of people being willing to listen to her and follow her lead. A second leadership trait that can be found on Diana is integrity. Diana could have chosen to stay in the isolated island, but for the sake of human race, she comes out to fight for the people who could not fight for themselves. She knows what the right thing to do is and she is not afraid to do it. A great sense of integrity persuades others to follow a leader, (Downard). So, when Diana exemplifies integrity in herself, people are more likely to follow her lead. Another trait found in Princess Diana is confidence. There is a line from the movie can best demonstrate her confidence. When they were near the No Man’s land, which refers to trenches occupied by German soldiers, Steve told Diana that no one could cross the land and asked her to leave. However, Diana replied, “I am the man who can” with great confidence (K. Cleary, 2017). Not everyone has such great confidence, so when Diana showed this kind of confidence, she impressed many soldiers around her, If Diana was not confident enough, she could not persuade Steve to trust her and she could not have managed to cross the land. Thus, this confidence makes Diana a better leader. In addition, according to John Boitnott, “Inspiration is a leadership skill” and Diana is an extremely inspiring person (2017). In the movie, Diana shows great power and energy. One of the most inspiring things she did was to push back the trenches that were occupied by German soldiers for years as mentioned. That scene demonstrates two things: First, Diana is very brave; Second, Diana has great power. Both of those things can inspire people and let them to follow her lead. As a result, the British soldiers were all encouraged and became braver to move forward to fight. When thinking about real world, such traits can be seen from many great leaders. Furthermore, Diana also possesses a very crucial characteristic of leader: excellent personal abilities in a specialized field. In this movie, it refers to her ability to win a battle. As she has great energy and magical power, Diana performs extremely well in the battlefield. She can even break the trenches which a group of soldiers cannot break for almost a year. This fairly demonstrates her excellent ability and thus made other soldiers more convinced by her. Therefore, it became more likely that the soldiers would be willing to follow her lead.
In conclusion, Wonder Woman is a movie which displays many elements of leadership. The main character, Princess Diana possesses a number of essential leadership traits, such as charisma, confidence, integrity, inspiration, excellent personal abilities. Those traits made her an excellent leader in their team. In addition, all of those traits can be found in real life and they should also be something that leaders try to obtain. Therefore, the film shows a great deal of leadership.

Remember when Director of National Intelligence James Clapper was asked by Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) during a March 12, 2012 hearing, “Does the NSA collect any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans?” Mr. Clapper answered, “No sir … not wittingly.”
After Edward Snowden spilled the National Security Agency’s beans three months later, Clapper retreated to his Ministry of Truth persona when asked by NBC’s Andrea Mitchell on June 10, 2013 why he lied to Mr. Wyden: “I responded in what I thought was the most truthful, or least untruthful, manner by saying, ‘No.’ ”
Mr. Clapper in February 2011 told a Capitol Hill hearing, whose audience Mr. Clapper apparently assessed had fallen off a turnip truck, that Egypt’s Muslim Brotherhood was “a very heterogeneous group, largely secular.” His office released a clarification of that one even before the day ended.
On Dec. 22, 2013, National Security Adviser Susan E. Rice insisted in a “60 Minutes” interview that NSA officials “inadvertently made false representations.” (Nov. 5, 2009) and the Boston Marathon (April 15, 2013).
Ms. Rice is getting good at this. She was U.N. Ambassador when the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, was assaulted on Sept. 11, 2012, resulting in the deaths of U.S. Ambassador to Libya J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. On four Sunday talk shows and for days afterward she, along with other administration officials including Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, insisted that it was not a terrorist attack but a spontaneous riot inflamed by an anti-Muhammad video on the Internet. Ms. Rice was later promoted to her current post.
The video story eventually fell apart. So the administration switched to blaming the CIA for giving Ms. Rice bad talking points. Maybe Mr. Clapper got some, too, for his NSA fib.
Incredibly, the New York Times on Dec. 28, 2013, tried to resurrect the video ploy with a 7,000-word article. Written by David D. Kirkpatrick, “A Deadly Mix in Benghazi” dismisses the claim that al-Qaeda played any role in the attack. Instead, the Times reports, local Islamic militants cased the consulate and engineered the.OK so I was reading a forum on a website called Cafemom.com and there was this women that posted about how she was a Work At Home Mom (WAHM) not a Stay At Home Mom (SAHM) was and that she thinks because she is working at home makez her not lazy and that SAHM are lazy well how is working at home not lazy? Seriously? What not driving to work everyday and not dealing with co workers is not being lazy? COME ON PEOPLE me being a stay at home mom I really am offeneded about this… ok so I get it you want to spend more time at home with the kids so instead of going to work you brought it home, but you don’t have to judge other mothers because they get to have the opportunity to stay home with their kids. some mothers are much lazier, how about those rich mothers who never see their kids and hire someone else to take care of them? so how dare you call us SAHM lazy there are much lazier mother and people out there!

My wife is also a stay at home mom and I am so thankful. I’m so glad she is there for our kiddos. I have nothing but respect for stay at home moms!
How annoying! I don’t understand why some women are so quick to judge and make assumptions. Although having said that, I’ve already judged her by assuming she’s a total harriden who I would never want to be friends with.Cap 3: Civil War

THIS BABY IS SO FUCKING CUTE
I'm an only child so I will never know that feel.
It came from your sister's vagina opening covered in her placenta.
...and you touched it.
you got any close friends that you consider siblings though? I feel like that's a similar feeling.
UNCLE MASTER RACE REPORTING
Actually that's a big pet peeve of mine - people who claim to be an uncle or aunt of a child they have no biological relation to.
I was an uncle at 12. I was like, "wat is babby whur is from"
i was 10 years old when i became an uncle.. didn't like holding the baby back then.
but since then i've got a ton of nephews and nieces and they're super cute.
lol nvm then. Sucks being uncle-less then.
how do i know if im an uncle?
i dont have any siblings and am not getting married
will never know that feel
I have 2 nieces and a 3rd niece/nephew is on the way
I was an uncle at 7 (really though I'm not trying to one up vesper and myvesti) and I have 3 nieces now but I don't really think I'm very "uncley" I'm more like a big brother to them
It is great until birthdays and Christmas, and you just beg your siblings to stop procreating so damn much, atleast until you get a raise. Fuck.
I was 9 when my niece was born so I was kinda "eh" about the whole thing. Lol. I mean, I was excited and all but it's just different when you're still a kid. I'm 22 now and my sister is due in May. I'm looking forward to being an uncle all over again.
Congrats mate!!!
I have known that feel 6 times.
Feels good.
I just learned that feel because my brother is a fuck up, his problem though not mine.
Dat feel when your only sibling is disabled and can't have kids
I became an uncle at the age of 11. I now have a total of 3 nieces. I don't really feel like an uncle though.Pacejet is pleased to announce integrated support for DHL eCommerce as the latest shipping carrier option in the Pacejet Carrier Network.

JONATHAN DIENER OF THE SWELLERS
INTERVIEWED BY WILLIAM BECKETT
The Swellers' album "Good For Me" is available now on Fueled By Ramen
I grew up on bands that I hear influences in your music like Millencolin and Strike Anywhere. Who helped sharpen your musical tastes growing up?
Those are definitely two very big influences on our band. The 90s and early 2000s Epitaph and Fat Wreck Chords were HUGE influences on us as a band. Most bands in our genre these days were influenced from hardcore, but we were always the punk guys. Millencolin's "Pennybridge Pioneers" is probably my favorite record and the one I share most memories with. Other bands like Nada Surf, Get Up Kids, Saves The Day, Weezer, Foo Fighters and Jimmy Eat World helped changed my life for the better as well. I think Nada Surf was the first band Nick and I really got into that wasn't a punk rock band.
You have a very keen sense of melody and focused, story based lyric in your songwriting, which I love. From one lyricist to another, what comes first for you: the lyric or the melody?
Originally we used to always do melody first. We think it's important to have a song that can emotionally move someone before they even hear what we're saying, then when we throw fitting lyrics on subjects that mean a lot to us (based on the vibe of the song) it becomes more of an experience. That's how we've always liked music. Lately the more I've been writing and contributing full songs ("Parkview", "Prime Meridian", etc.) I've been adding lyrics as I create the melody so it's all at once kind of thing. More bands need to focus on melody because that's what gets stuck in our heads.
One of the first things that caught my attention on your new record, secondary to the black dog about to devour the helpless little kid, was how awesome the record SOUNDS. What was it like working with the legendary Bill Stevenson, and did you fanboy much?
Haha! We have always been huge fans of Bill's bands like Descendents, Black Flag, Only Crime and even The Lemonheads record he played on and produced. He has this magical touch he puts on all of his records. Most of my favorite records were recorded at his studio The Blasting Room and it was a dream come true being able to not only record there, but sleep there and even experience half of the Descendents having band practice for their upcoming shows. That's something you don't see everyday. Bill was very cool with us picking his brain and I think he knows how awesome he is.
In 2011, you've toured with such bands as Bayside, Polar Bear Club, Fake Problems and Four Year Strong. What bands would be a part of your dream tour?
We've done a LOT of touring, not only in the states but in Asia, Europe, UK, Australia and some Canada... and we still have a few months til the end of the year. It's crazy. I think my dream tour would be something like Foo Fighters, Millencolin, Nada Surf and A Wilhelm Scream. I love each band's full discography, would sing every word and probably get weirdly emotional while watching them each night. I still haven't seen Nada Surf live so even though we probably wouldn't fit in too well with them, it's a selfish move on my part just to see them 30 or so nights in a row.
Your video for "Best I Ever Had" chronicles the transformation of youth into young adulthood, paying homage to the times that helped shape you into who you are today. But let's cut to the chase... Who or what IS the best you ever had?
You are really good at asking questions, I'm jealous. Now people are gonna judge me even more. So....
You guys work hard. You tour constantly and have put out 5 records since you began. How do you think the expansion of technology and the internet will effect work ethic of bands forming in the 2010's, if at all?
Right now everything in the music industry is completely chaotic. There used to be a semi-formula that skeptics and suits could put together and guess the next big thing. Right now, CD sales are plummeting but downloading is making MORE people like music... but then fewer people are going to shows because of competition and the "recession". I think people just expect more bang for their buck and its up to bands like us to pave the way to new creative, cost-effective ideas that will change things. If you live on the model of albums selling from 10 years ago... even 5 years ago... it's totally bogus. Adapt or die. Give the people what they want.
2012 is around the corner. Mayan calendar ends... Does the world end with it? And if so, what will you be doing on the eve of December 21st?
I don't think the world will end. Maybe there will be some screwed up global things going on if whatever they predicted happening would happen, but if you look in the past these things are usually B.S. I do admire the Mayan culture and the fact that their jobs were staring at the stars, studying them their whole lives. I think they knew more than we know today due to all of our distractions. I'm sure there will be an "end of the world party" somewhere I'll be attending.. or I'll hopefully be laying on a couch with my girlfriend watching Netflix. That sounds like a better plan.
If the 4 Swellers boys all individually entered Royal Rumble, who'd be first in the ring, who'd illegally interfere, who would last longest and who'd hide under the ring until the end to claim victory?
This is an amazing question, yet again. Anto is probably the cockiest of us all when it comes to claiming his wrestling ability. I think Ryan would jump in first to start things off, and probably last the longest. Nick would illegally interfere with a steel chair or do a cheap shot after distracting the referee. Anto would be the most charismatic and run around like a crazy guy because that's what he is. I think I'd be the guy under the ring who would toss the last guy over and win. It's all about strategy, and that's one thing I'm good at. Strength? Not so much.
Marry/Kiss/Kill? Scarlett Johansen, Kim Karashian, and Condeleeza Rice. Keep in mind, ScarJo can not be tamed...
Oh man. Probably kill Mrs. Rice, just because she's affiliated with things I don't dig. She's also a subject of a cool Against Me! song. I think marrying Scarlett would work out, she seems like the type that would actually settle down later in life. Kim Kardashian would probably want me to go to annoying dance clubs and meet terrible people. But I'd be ok with playing 7 minutes in heaven with her and keeping it to that haha! unit 50 of the service required. It may for example do this by sending the first logic unit the name of a remote procedure along with a list of input and output parameters. The first logic unit unit unit 80, and the subsequent sending of a request to the second logic unit 90.
The second logic unit unit 90 during the performance of the requested tasks and when results are to be sent back to the first computer 10. The second logic unit (ORB) has been defined, which provides the object-oriented bridge between the client and the server machines. The ORB decouples the client and server applications from the object oriented implementation details, performing at least part of the work of the first and second logic unit 50 and 90 as well as the connection unit 80. So, there is usually an ORB software component running on both the client and the server computers so that the client and server can communicate with each other in order to make use of each other's local objects.
It is often desirable to provide so-called “thin”(or light-weight) clients which contain a minimum amount of software functionality so that the client machine can be made easily portable (e.g., a set-top box, personal digital assistant (PDA), laptop computer, or computerized cellular telephone with display screen). However, the thinner the client the less functionality the client is capable of supporting. Thus, it has been difficult to use “thin” clients in situations where the client must be available to serve requests which could involve a wide variety of functionality.
According to one aspect, the present invention provides a data processing apparatus in communication with a network for allowing the apparatus to communicate with a second data processing apparatus via the network, the data processing apparatus comprising: a receiving unit for receiving a request on a target object; an activating unit for activating the target object if the target object is inactive; and a dispatching unit for dispatching the request to the target object for execution thereby; wherein the activating unit determines whether software components which it needs to activate the target object are stored locally and if it determines that the software components are not stored locally the activating unit downloads such software components over the network from the second data processing apparatus; and wherein the activating unit selects candidate software components from the locally stored software components based on predetermined criteria and deletes the candidate software components from local storage.
According to a second aspect, the present invention provides a method of carrying out the functionality of the first aspect of the invention.
According to a third aspect, the present invention provides a computer program product, stored on a computer readable storage medium, for, when run on a computer, instructing the computer to carry out the functionality of the first aspect of the invention.
Thus, with the present invention, a client machine's working set of software code is allowed to dynamically “grow” and “shrink” depending on demand. This makes a thin client much better able to participate in a distributed computing environment (such as an ORB setting) where the client can be called upon to perform a wide variety of tasks yet still remain “thin” (or lightweight in terms of the amount of active software code in the client's working set). Specifically, if the client is called upon to do a particular task at one point in time, the client makes sure that it has the appropriate software components in its working set by, if necessary, downloading such software components into its working set from a server machine over the network (if the software components are already in the working set, then there is no need for such downloading). At a later point in time, for example, if such downloaded components have not been used for awhile, they can be deleted from the working set to keep the client's working set small. The invention thus enables a thin client to participate fully in a distributed processing environment (such as an ORB setting).
A preferred embodiment of the present invention will now be described by drawing reference to the following drawing figures.
FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a well-known heterogeneous client/server architecture using object technology, in the context of which the present invention can be applied;
FIG. 2 is another block diagram showing a heterogeneous client/server architecture using object technology, in the context of which the present invention can be applied;
FIG. 3 is a flowchart showing the steps involved when a request is received by a client computer, according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention; and
FIG. 4 is a flowchart showing the steps involved when a client periodically removes software components which are not often used, according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention.
An object adaptor 11 (OA) (see FIG. 2) is a piece of software defined in the OMG's ORB standard. The OA 11 receives requests issued by the server computer 20's ORB 22, such requests being passed over a network from ORB 22 in server computer 20 to ORB 12 in client computer 10. The OA determines how a target object 13 (which has been requested access to) is to be activated in response to the request. The OA 11 links a request to a particular implementation mechanism, prepares the target object, and dispatches (delivers) the request to the target object 13. The early versions of the published OMG standard did not specify much detail about how the OA 11 should be implemented.
The OMG has recently published a new standard (CORBA/IIOP Version 2.2 February 1998) which describes a Portable Object Adaptor (POA), thus giving more detail as to the implementation of an OA. Specifically, the POA described in the OMG standard provides a “servant manager” interface with the ability to activate an object on demand when a POA receives a request on a target object which is inactive. Thus, according to the new POA standard, a request on a target object 13 is held in the OA (i.e., POA) 11 and the OA 11 determines whether the target object 13 is active (ready to serve a request) and if the target object 13 is inactive the POA activates the target object to ready the target object to serve the request. This is all well known and specified in the published OMG POA standard in conjunction with other published OMG standards.
If the client computer 10 is a light-weight (or “thin”) client, it is desirable that the working set of active implementation classes maintained in the client be as small as possible (in order to keep the client “thin”). Thus, the object adaptor 11, according to the present invention, is programmed to carry out the following functionality as described by the steps of the flowchart of FIG. 3.
In FIG. 3, at step 31 a request is received by the OA 11, the request being a request for access to a target object 13. At step 32, the OA 11 determines whether the target object is active, that is, whether the implementation class(es) necessary for the target object to carry out the necessary processing to execute the request are loaded and ready. If the YES branch is taken at step 32, control flows to step 36 where the request is dispatched from the OA 11 to the target object 13. If the NO branch is taken at step 32, then control flows to step 33 where it is determined whether the necessary software components (i.e., implementation classes) for the target object to carry out the processing to execute the request are present locally to the client computer 10. That is, it is determined whether such software components stored or maintained locally within the client machine's memory 14. If the YES branch is taken at step 33, control flows to step 35, where the target object 13 is activated.
If the NO branch is taken at step 33, control flows to step 34 where the necessary software components for the target object to carry out the processing to execute the request are downloaded from a server computer (e.g., 20) which stores such software components. After this step is carried out, control flows to step 35 where the target object is activated. Then, control flows to step 36 where, as stated above, the request is dispatched to the activated target object.
The above functionality allows a client computer 10 to be light-weight (thin) because the client does not need to come pre-loaded with many software components, any components which are later found to be necessary can be downloaded from a server. However, over time, the usefulness of such a technique would be limited because the client would soon collect many software components which it may not use very often and thus it is very difficult or impossible for the client to remain “thin” in terms of the amount of software functionality it contains at any one time. Thus, the first embodiment of the invention periodically checks to determine how often software components contained within the client are used with respect to received requests. Only software components which are heavily used are maintained in the client 10. Others are discarded and if they are needed again, they can be downloaded again, on demand, from the server 20. This maintains the client 10 as a “thin” client. FIG. 4 shows the steps involved in implementing this functionality in the preferred embodiment of the present invention.
At step 41, the client 10 stores (in memory 14) statistics on the usage of each of the locally maintained software components in the client's working set of such components. That is, for each software component that is maintained locally (e.g., that is stored in storage 14), statistics are kept of how often each software component is actually used by the client in executing requests. At step 42, the client 10 periodically checks the stored statistical data to determine which software components have not been used very often and deletes those software components from local storage 14. For example, a threshold amount of use could be checked for, such as “has each software component been used at least 10 times since the last periodic check”. The frequency of the periodic check is set depending on how often the client is expected to be called upon to execute requests. For a heavily active client, the periodic check is carried out once every minute, but for a client that is not called very often, once a day would be sufficient. The threshold amount of times a software component has been used is also set based on the particular needs of the client involved, such as how “thin” the particular client must be.
In a second embodiment, the check of stored statistics and subsequent deletion is done not on a periodic basis but instead is done during the execution of the flowchart of FIG. 3 (e.g. immediately before the downloading step 34). Thus, adequate storage space for a download is provided immediately prior to the download.
In addition to the amount of use, many other factors can also be taken into account in determining which software components should be deleted. For example, if some software components are part of a group (and all components of the group must be present in the client in order for the client to be able to carry out the function represented by the group) and other components of the group have already been deleted, then the remaining components of the group are likely candidates for next deletion. The size of the files of the locally stored software components can also be taken into account in deciding which components to delete. Further, software components that have travelled a long distance to get to the client machine (e.g. they were previously downloaded from a server in another country) might be less likely candidates for deletion because it may take a while to download them again if they are needed again after deletion.
Thus, emerging ORB standards make possible the dynamic management of a ‘working set’ of application class implementation code on a user's machine. Class implementations are downloaded and deleted on demand from a user's client machine using a mechanism where this is automatic and transparent to the user.
This is analogous to recent trends in on-line help implementation whereby help text is formatted using html and viewed with a browser. Most help material is delivered with the application CD-ROM. However, when accessing this help some topics actually pull seldom accessed or frequently updated material from the vendor's website with the boundary between the installed help text and the downloaded help text not being obvious to the user. (An example of this is the IBM DB2 UDB V5.0 online help material.) The invention achieves a system whereby something similar can be done transparently for software.
A core set of application classes is installed as a base package. This base contains as a minimum the same top level user interface as a fully featured ‘traditional’ application with, for example, menu options for features that are currently installed and the menu options for the features not currently downloaded to the client machine. When the features that are not currently installed are accessed from the user interface the mechanism of the preferred embodiment of the present invention comes into play.
The mechanism relies on a novel use of the newly published OMG standard for ORB Portable Object Adapters(POAs) that replaces the previous Object Adapter OMG specification material. The first beta implementations of this POA standard are being delivered currently. As described above, Object adaptors (OA) are passed requests that are brokered by an ORB. The OA determines how an object(request) is activated. It has a means to link a request to a particular implementation mechanism, the means to prepare the receiver (target) object and to deliver the request to it.
The OA is usually shared between many instances and classes of objects. More specific to the target class of the object is a generated skeleton/servant object for that particular class which is responsible for delivering the request in the specific form expected by the objects implementation code. Using current ORB and OA architectures the mechanism of a problem that is encountered is the management of the ‘holes’ left by the missing class skeletons and implementations which are nonetheless having requests brokered against them. These skeletons could either be
1) missing entirely—in which case the OA would have to deal specifically with missing stubs by downloading them
OR
2) be a form of ‘skeleton-skeleton’ that first downloaded the real skeleton before forwarding the request
In order to keep OAs fairly class neutral, choice 2) is preferable, however, it is preferable to replace the ‘skeleton-skeleton’ that does the downloading with the downloaded one.
A much more elegant solution is made possible by the new POA specification. The new POA specification introduces a new layer between the object adapter and the skeleton/servant (termed servant in the POA spec). This layer is the ‘Servant Manager Interface’, these are introduced with: “A servant manager supplies a POA with the ability to activate objects on demand when a POA receives a request targeted at an inactive object”. The operations envisaged here are retrieving persistent data and activating the object's instance. However, it is now quite feasible for the servant manager to recognise that the objects implementation CLASS CODE is not present on the local machine and download the necessary class across the network. Subsequently behaving as normal, the operation would not be detectable from the calling object apart from the additional processing time.
A further part of the preferred embodiment of the present invention is to get the Servant Manager to also delete implementation class files that are no longer being used. The algorithms used in other ‘paging’ type systems can immediately be seen to apply and we have a mechanism for maintaining a dynamic ‘working set’ of class implementation files that grows and shrinks with use and within the capacity of the client's resources over time.
Thus, provided is a mechanism for the automatic and dynamic management of the installed portion of an object orientated application on a network connected computer system, that application using the facilities of an object request broker. The mechanism preferably involves:
1) Utilisation of the facilities of the ORB intended for the activation for object instances from backing storage as a means for activating the mechanism (the mechanism being shipped as part of the application code) and registering with the ORB using standard architectured means.
2) Providing only a subset of the available application's feature implementation to be installed initially in the computer. This subset having the facility to request of the ORB functions from both the locally available features and requests targeted at object classes not currently downloaded on the computer in the normal manner.
3) The mechanism will be registered as the ORB using the architectured means for the activation of instances of ‘persistent’ classes within the application and will have available the network server location of all class' implementation code. Furthermore, the mechanism will download missing class implementations across the network when necessary transparently as part of instance activation processing.
4) The mechanism will maintain sufficient data to enable the deletion of the implementation code of the classes of the application it is managing. Furthermore, this facility will be available during the loading of such other classes, or at ORB or application start-up or shut-down as desired.
5) The mechanism will couple a suitable ‘paging’ type algorithm together with the maintenance of sufficient statistics on the loading/deletion of the classes it is managing with features above to enable a dynamic ‘working set’ of classes within the application to be maintained. This set being influenced by the pattern of loading requests received, the capacity of the local system or some other configurable mechanism.
The preferred embodiment is based on the new OMG portable object adapter (POA) specification and ORBs which implement it such as the Sun/Javasoft POA orb. Please see OMG document “Orb Portability Joint Submission (Final) orbos/97-05-15” for well known background material on the POA.
An example embodiment of the invention provides an application such as a word processor as a set of user interface classes together with a core set of classes that all users would be expected to use - say open, saving and simple editing of files.
Together with this set of classes an implementation of this mechanism is shipped. It is an object which registers itself with the ORBS POA as a subclass of org.omg.PortableServer.POA (as a ‘child POA’ to the root POA). This is necessary as the child POA will have the USE_SERVANT_MANAGER policy set on it. Also provided is an instance of the org.omg.PortableServer.ServantManager class that is the servant manager for the child POA. It is this ServantManager which is the preferred embodiment of the present invention.
All object references issued by the application's object factories or any ‘flattened’ object references shipped with the application will identify the child POA. All requests to objects not already active in the system and thereby not already having an entry in the ‘active object map’ will use the callback mechanism of the servant manager to identify an appropriate servant for that newly created object. Our servant manager will therefore be given visibility of all initial calls to object instances.
The servant manager, being particular to this application, maintains a table with one row for each class (or downloadable chunk) of the application. Each row would typically have the following elements:
the class(or chunk) name
eg DocTableColSorter
if the class currently downloaded
TRUE
the name of the local file
C:/progs/myapp/classes/DOCTSRT.DLL
or
c: /apps/myapp/classes/DocTableCOlSorter.class
the size of the implementation file
234696 bytes
the number or active requests on object of this class
5
the date/time when class was last used
14/05/98-12:01.02.232312
the location of the code server version of the class T.DLL
When scheduling requests on objects for the first time the Servant Manager (during the ServantManager::incarnate or preinvoke methods) consults the table and retrieves the required implementation class if required. It then activates the instance of the object and returns the servant in the normal manner. It can be seen that this is analogous to a ‘page break’ in a virtual memory system and similar algorithms could be applied.
If the client does not have sufficient space within the area allotted for use by this application the ServantManager can use the information in the table to select a class implementation to discard from the local system.
This is a form of ‘garbage collection’ at the class implementation level. Though it is envisaged that in most applications of this technique the set of downloaded classes will stabilise to fit in with the well trodden paths of the user, it would be possible to use this approach to allow a single user session to make use of more classes than could fit into the client machine at any one time. As the working set evolved each user would download only the classes they used, lightweight users would have small client footprints, power users would have full functionality available locally and users of machines too small to install the whole application could still access all it's features—just not all at the same time.
In summary, the preferred embodiment of the present invention exploits the features of OMG compliant ORBs intended for object instance activation to enable automatic download on demand of class implementation code across the network to a client machine. This is coupled with stored information on such downloaded classes to enable them to be deleted again from the client system. Also store simple statistics on usage of such classes to enable algorithmic management of a ‘working set’ of implementation classes tailored to the functions that are actually used by the user of that particular client machine thereby providing an object-oriented application with a much smaller ‘client footprint’. The mechanism allows client footprints to adapt to how the application is used and to the capacity of the client machine. It is feasible that in very constrained client environments (such as phones, set top boxes etc) the ‘working set’ of the application can evolve over the course of a single session providing a mechanism akin to automatic code overlays for classes and allowing larger applications to be used in such machines.Market data as of 12:00AM 05/21/15.

Just to expand a bit on Matthias's statement above. [The following does NOT imply that you have any malicious reasons, it merely explains the situation a bit more fully.] We thought long and hard about this when it first came up. The problem is that binary packages have to be added by root, and so there's a possibility of "problems". We decided early on that the best way to get around these"problems" was by having a trusted user create packages. Whilst this does not preclude you from putting up binary packages on your own web site, and announcing this fact on port-vax, in lieu of digital signatures on binary packages a la RPM, I'm afraid that's the situation.

###Facebook pays for security loopholes
- 30 August 2011
- From the section Technology
Facebook has spent $40,000 (£25,000) in the first 21 days of a program that rewards the discovery of security bugs.
The bug bounty program aims to encourage security researchers to help harden Facebook against attack.
One security researcher has been rewarded with more than $7,000 for finding six serious bugs in the social networking site.
The program runs alongside Facebook's efforts to police the code it creates that keeps the social site running.
A blog post by Facebook chief security officer Joe Sullivan revealed some information about the early days of the bug bounty program.
He said the program had made Facebook more secure by introducing the networking site to "novel attack vectors, and helping us improve lots of corners in our code".
The minimum amount paid for a bug is $500, said Mr Sullivan, up to a maximum of $5000 for the most serious loopholes. The maximum bounty has already been paid once, he said.
Many cyber criminals and vandals have targeted Facebook in many different ways to extract useful information from people, promote spam or fake goods.
Mr Sullivan said Facebook had internal bug-hunting teams, used external auditors to vet its code and ran "bug-a-thons" to hunt out mistakes but it regularly received reports about glitches from independent security researchers.
Facebook set up a system to handle these reports in 2010 which promised not to take legal action against those that find bugs and gave it chance to assess them.
Paying those that report problems was the logical next step for the disclosure system, he said.
Graham Cluley, senior technology consultant at Sophos, said many other firms, including Google and Mozilla, run similar schemes that have proved useful in rooting out bugs.
However, he said, many criminally-minded bug spotters might get more for what they find if they sell the knowledge on an underground market.
He added that the bug bounty scheme might be missing the biggest source of security problems on Facebook.
"They're specifically not going to reward people for identifying rogue third party Facebook apps, clickjacking scams and the like," he said. "It's those sorts of problems which are much more commonly encountered by Facebook users and have arguably impacted more people."
Facebook should consider setting up a "walled garden" that only allowed vetted applications from approved developers to connect to the social networking site, he said.
"Facebook claims there are over one million developers on the Facebook platform, so it's hardly surprising that the service is riddled with rogue apps and viral scams," he said.“The Real Housewives of Atlanta” star Kenya Moore’s friend showed up at her house after the fight on last night's episode with a black eye, a cracked rib and a swollen face. He admitted that he had created a police report and was considering pressing charges, but revealed that he probably wasn't going to do so. According to a new Wetpaint Entertainment report published on Feb. 9, “The Real Housewives of Atlanta” star Kenya Moore would have pressed charges against Apollo if she was the one with a cracked rib.
"This is what I do know. I hold all the cards. All of the cards," he tells Kenya. "If this was just him and Phaedra, trust me. But what I keep thinking about is Aiden and their newborn. Do you know what I mean?" He doesn’t want to press charges against Apollo, because of the children. Kenya doesn’t necessarily agree with his decision, but she respects his wishes. "If it had been my decision," she says, "Apollo would be behind bars because that's where gorillas belong."
Oddly enough, Apollo has a completely different side of the story. When he was sharing his story with Phaedra, he claims he was trying to stop the fighting. "I was having a good time actually, until the madness came," he recounts. "And then Brandon fell down on the bean bag. So when he fell on the bean bag, that's when I put my shoes on. When he was getting up off the bean bag, I just saw a lot of rage in his eyes so I tried to run over there and do this number but apparently whatever I tried to do wasn't appropriate. I was just trying to hold him back and then I know I got hit and I just got carried away."

Compare Prices on Pacific Pearl South Pacific Cruises
Family Friendly Cruise
Pacific Pearl cruise P131 Sydney October 9 - 20. 'Pacific Sunsets' - 5 Ports: Vanuatu - Luganville, Wala, Champagne Bay, Port Vila; New Caledonia - Lifou.
Travel to Sydney was easy via private vehicle and the parking arrangements at Darling Harbour for the cruises are easy to deal with, with no cost.
Embarkation process was fairly easy and painless, and seemed to go smoothly. Given that our cabin was on deck 5 midships near the Atrium we also easily located it, and subsequently had a smooth trip (mostly). The first three 'sea days' were quite smooth, as were the subsequent sailings to the ports. There was then about a day and a half of rough swell, I estimated at times up to about 8 metres, with what I would describe as about a constant 5 metre swell, thankfully not too many actual waves. The sick bags were put out and at times many people appeared to be in their cabins (based on the lack of people seen). This being my families second cruise we prepared for it this More time, by taking medication as a preventative measure, and no doubt the fact our cabin was in a fairly central location helped as well. Our precautions and cabin selection certainly seemed to save us the hassle and pain experienced two years ago (granted, first cruise) of our son getting a needle. No such problems this time. I definitely recommend going for a mid level and midship type window cabin as a minimum.
The 'stateroom' for the three of us (Mum, dad, child) seemed spacious enough and there was loads of drawer space for the too many clothes we took with us. I would say however, that in regard to being 'refitted' the extent of that in the cabins is likely only the flat screen Tv's. Further evidence of this was discovered on a search one day when we thought we had misplaced a piece of clothing, and subsequent pulling out of a drawer found items of clothing not belonging to us, along with photographs of people from a 2008 cruise on Ocean Village (Pearl's previous name). We have decided to try and find the people ourselves (perhaps with this websites help) through the internet. Our cabin steward was friendly and kept the cabin clean and tidy, with a good supply of towels and had the uncanny knack of hardly being seen, but tidying up as needed (even when we had the occasional sleep in).
Others had some issues with their cabins, and there appeared to be more than one location on the ship where toilets had overflowed in cabins, with blowers seen in halls and from what was heard carpets replaced, but no major gripes heard in regard to this.
The placement of public access toilets seems to need some work, or at least some co-ordination of the cleaning schedules, with many occasions finding a toilet being cleaned, directed to another level and that one also being cleaned (for us being midship, often quicker and easier to go to our own cabin). Not too many breakdowns of the public toilet system, though most are probably caused by persons putting items down them that they shouldn't, of course depending on where a breakdown happens it can affect cabins as well (obviously a system that needs some work). For us personally though, no real dramas with access to facilities.
Kids club. Our son was in Turtle Cove, with friends also having children in Turtle Cove and Shark Shack. All of the kids known to us (7 in all) always wanted to go, and were by no means 'dumped' by the parents involved. With the ability to be able to authorise friends to drop off and pick up, along with older kids (8 and over) being able to be given sign in/out privileges (up to a certain time) the process wasn't too painful. Though the entrance to/from is fairly narrow and bottle necks occurred at times when group 'non sign in' activities had finished and the club was re-opened with the subsequent rush creating a bottleneck. Though there seemed to be no issues with a laid back bunch on this cruise. The kids seemed to like the activities, and for those that didn't want to do them, there were PlayStation's and the like. There were activities advertised for shark shack to play playstation up on the big screen on Deck 12, but apparently only a few were selected for this, which no doubt may cause dramas for some parents with certain types of children, though no major issues were heard on this cruise.
Activities/Entertainment. Activities generally seemed okay, particularly for those of us into trivia (apart from the 65 cruise 'veterans' who new all of the recycled questions, but were beaten a few times). Though given the presence of children and teenagers many 'adult' type comedy shows and the like were on late, which for those of us with children meant at times missing out. I did hear some complaints of others about the lack of activities, and perhaps for those that don't like trivia, bingo or a lecture on quilling, activities would be lacking. The entertainment such as the singer/dancers put on a good show, as did the comedian. The magician/illusionist was excellent, but unfortunately was only on for one show. The 'Marquee' where shows are held has seating and sight issues that should probably be addressed. The cruise director Zoltina-J (apparently the only Australian crew member on board) was vivacious and outgoing, with an exceptional assistant director Willie, ably assisted by Gareth. The 'entertainment team' was apparently down on two members but still managed to run the activities with assistance of dance crew members. Outside activities may have suffered due to the missing two members.
Dining. Plantation. The plantation is the buffet and we used it at all times for breakfast, sometimes for lunch, and never at dinner time. The breakfast selection seemed to leave very little for anyone to complain about and we had no complaints in regard to the variety on offer, with Soy milk available on request, and full cream and skim always on hand in jugs. The cutlery, trays and plates were always initially issued by a crew member and all people entering Plantation and Waterfront had to use sanitizer (a good thing upon seeing some not washing hands in rest rooms).
The lunch service generally had a good selection, but the drink service left a lot to be desired. On more than one occasion it was quicker to go out onto deck 12 to the bar or a cart to order a drink and bring it back in, than wait for the at times non existent waiter to come and take drink orders.
We took a few lunches in the Waterfront Restaurant and the drink service was bordering on appalling. At times, it would take 20 minutes or more just to place an initial order, and if you had managed to order and receive an initially drink, you could just about forget on ordering a second one later. There seemed to be a distinct lack of drink waiters on the lunch service, luckily they always filled up the glasses on the table with water, or you would have gone thirsty.
At dinner service, ourselves and friends had the same table each night and our waiter did an admirable job along with his assistant. I say admirable as when he was with us he was very attentive, particularly to the children, but appeared rushed. A cake was also organised by him for one of the children in our group who had a birthday on board. I believe they may have been down on wait staff as well. The meals seemed generally good, but temperature was at times an issue, as was timing of entrees and mains, and I found the dessert selection disappointing. My wife requested in advance lactose free meals and this was accommodated, even on an evening when she indicated that the menu the next day had nothing to appeal, our waiter had the food and beverage supervisor approach us and organised for specific meals for my wife. We were quite happy just to go to the buffet, and certainly made no fuss about it, but they went above and beyond in providing a special meal the next night, with the supervisor coming by to check. That was exceptional service. The drink service again suffered in the Waterfront, but was not quite as bad as the lunch service. The staff and supervisors all seemed to do good jobs, and likely just a bit of tweaking is needed to improve drink service. I suspect that staff numbers is likely an issue.
Other. Photographs. Overpriced. The photographs taken by the onboard photographers were overpriced, and at times poorly taken (eyes closed, come on!!). Worse still, even after people had gathered all of their photos behind one (thus saving space) and were considering possible purchase, they were all thrown out without warning, signs were then put up after the fact requesting that unwanted photos be handed in. Personally didn't do shopping on board, but I was reliably informed that everything is overpriced. Better to shop at ports (Vila) for genuine duty free.
.
Ports. The tender service to Wala, Champagne bay and the like was well run, a vast improvement on our Pacific Dawn experience two years ago. I would caution the value of P & O run shore excursions. Took one in Luganville, and the van was un air conditioned with vinyl seats (advertised as A/C), luckily being from a hot weather area not too much of a concern for us, but others would have issues. The 'free' walking tour (donations requested) we took on wala seemed like better value than the paid trip at luganville, with more tribes people involved and more activities shown. The water at all ports was beautifuly clear, but unfortunately a few of us got some rashes from the Champagne Bay visit, which was likely down to sea lice of sorts, not too bad though and lasted only a day or so. Vila is the place (in Vanuatu) to save any duty free shopping for. All ports on the cruise accepted Australian currency, and given we were in Vila on a Sunday we still had quite a few shops to look at, a long with self organised tours. Some may find the touting of the local taxi drivers at the port confronting, but our group of seven managed to get a good air conditioned van with a good driver for the day for a good price. Vila is a place my family and I intend to return to.
Disembarkation was well organised and painless.
In summary, I would say that as long as someone isn't expecting a 5 star experience, then P & O offer value for money. If someone goes on board ready to pick nits, they'll find issues, but if you go on in holiday mode and go with the flow, it's a good experience. Even those of us laid back and relaxed, notice things like poor drink service, but even then you generally manage to live with it. The ship had some creaks and groans when in the rough seas, and the cabins certainly haven't been refurbished, but I would say that for a family after a value for money experience, you can't go much wrong with P & O Australia.

The Legendary Pink Dots are one of those bands that defies any coherent explanation; they are the purest in surreal psychedelia. Lyrically the comparisons to early Pink Floyd are apt, as Edward Ka-Spel travels a plane of existence perhaps only tread byUncle Syd himself. Together the pink man (Ka Spel), and the Silver Man (Phil Knight) compose music than mixes and transcends genres unlike anything you have or may ever hear.
So needless to say, I was in awe while at Death # Disco—before the sold out Berlin Pink Dots show, when I had sat down backstage with Mr. Ka-Spel to discuss the new record 10 to the Power of 9, and the many other releases and reissues being released an unbelievably kinetic pace…
Post-Punk: So with 10 to the Power of 9, as per your summation of the record, I have become stuck upon thinking about the oligarchies, and those who control the world lately…
Edward Ka-Spel: When you start thinking about it, there it is. Especially distortions in the media. I have access to the Western news, and the Russian news. My wife is Russian, so I see the picture quite fully; most of the aggression is coming from America.
Post-Punk: I agree somewhat. Although I am not the biggest supporter of Putin (I had a Russian girlfriend for 3 years, and we would argue back and forth about him), look at what we are now dealing with in the US. The country has elected those who want to go back to the 50’s, who want to go back to the Coldwar…they want to go back to that common enemy.
Edward Ka-Spel: I know…! It’s Orwellian…the enemy that is far away and the war that is far away but perpetual. Some people find comfort in that.
Post-Punk: I suppose the best way is to unite people through fear, and if you can do that, it is easy to placate them with all the toys they can be placated with. Unite people through the fear of Ebola or the fear of Arabs…
Edward Ka-Spel: They will find an enemy where ever they can find one. I am living in London at the moment, so I have to deal with the British…
Post-Punk: It’s amazing the resurgence of conservatism there as well. Seems like people want to go back to the Thatcher years.
Edward Ka-Spel: I think it’s actually worse. At least under Thatcher you kind of knew what she was all about. It’s very clear, disgusting, vulgar, and crude. But Cameron is a very weak man, who will say whatever it takes to get the vote, usually the bigot vote.
Post-Punk: The bigot vote is the big ticket! I think we live in the year of the bigot. Also a time where there is too much anger and taking offence towards everything
Edward Ka-Spel: Yes. I hate fundamentalism. Whether it be Christian Fundamentalism…Muslim Fundamentalism, it disgusts me. I feel like it’s base stupidity. It’s going back, It’s regressing.
Post-Punk: I think people focus too much on religion and not the culture, which is often confused for being one and the same with the Religion. I think Arab culture is very beautiful when it is separated from all the religious Dogma, This is the same with all cultures, and when you throw the Dogma on top of everything, you really miss the way people truly live.
Edward Ka-Spel: But there are people in influential positions, who like nothing more than to spew out Dogma, and whip up all that hate.
Post-Punk: We could probably do the whole interview talking about politics, dogma, and bigotry. However, this is just what I was getting from 10 to the Power of 9. Sometimes it can be difficult for me to trace a coherent narrative based upon the surreal nature of your work. And it’s a lot of work that has be put out there. You just released something on Halloween, and you have a new solo record… The Victoria Dimension
Edward Ka-Spel: The Victoria Dimension…
Post-Punk: But…wait…going back for a second to all the hate and political turmoil…do you think there is still “hope”?
Edward Ka-Spel: Sure. If you give up hope, you might as well…you know. You have to have hope. I also have a 5 year old daughter, I foresee a future for that little girl, which means I have to believe in the future. There are a lot of good people, good things, there is a lot of beauty in the world still. It may be a bit hard to see it sometimes, but it doesn’t mean that it’s not there.
Post-Punk: Maybe it’s our emotional states clouding our vision.
Edward Ka-Spel: Maybe it’s just a stage the world has to go through. People need to learn; you can’t lean on a man in the sky, or some sort of politician and ultimately you it comes down to yourself—you are the governor of your own soul. You can’t hide in any thing, or any body, or behind any Dogma. Ulimately it always comes down to yourself. believe the purest state is a kind of Anarchy.
Post-Punk: Yes. But it is amazing that those who live outside the imposed society, especially creative people—they find each other and build their own communities. It intrigues me that for someone who has had such a long career, you have fully embraced bandcamp and use it to reach out directly to your fans.
Edward Ka-Spel: I really love Bandcamp, I must admit it. With it you are able to present yourself as you really are. On a whim—I can create something over a couple o days and post it, fresh as a daisy, like the Halloween Special—a then take it down a few days later, because it’s not Halloween anymore.
Post-Punk: I love this limited edition culture, where the music is appreciated more, and a band puts something on sale, only sells a set number of copies, then It’s gone. “It’s at his house”, reminds me of a recent interview with Henry Rollins about the state of the music industry.
Edward Ka-Spel: Things like that are like “Let’s celebrate this moment” and the moment is gone, it can’t return—and it WILL NOT return. It’s free—so why not? But the actual back catalog, I want to try to get it all on there.
Post-Punk: I saw that Asylum has been reissued, I am really excited about that.
Edward Ka-Spel: That’s really beautiful—It’s wonderful how that was done. I was knocked out, I could not believe when I saw that CD.
Post-Punk: The first time I heard The Legendary Pink Dots, I was working at Tower Records on South Street in Philadelphia. One of my managers would often play Scott Walker (a few years afterTilt came out), Bowie’s Low, and Pink Dots records on the store sound system. As a gift he then made me a mix tape withCurse, The Tower, and Asylum on it—I’ve been a fan ever since! I get the sense that many people were introduced to Pink Dots in a similar fashion.
Edward Ka Spel: Word of mouth…
Post-Punk: I was looking at a journal entry that Amanda Palmer wrote on her website on how she became a fan of The Legendary Pink Dots
through this older friend of hers…and now she is now this icon—and you were one of her biggest inspirations!
Edward Ka Spel: Yeah, I know Amanda well. We will possibly be recording soon. We were meant to earlier this year, but she couldn’t make it. She’s been very busy, new book and all, but I talk to her every couple of weeks.
Post-Punk: I don’t know Amanda well, but I do know Brian Viglione, we have hung out a few times back in New York when he moved there. He is a wonderful person.
So, what else do you have coming out down the line, anything else exciting?
Edward Ka Spel: There’s A Star Too Far with Randall, it’s called The Service. That’s due out in December. There’s The Maria Dimension Vinyl boxset, that’s almost there. Yes, for a small band the rules have changed in a way. Not many people buy anything anymore. That’s the sad reality of it. So you have to have the special editions, and sell a little bit here and a little bit there, and hopefully, at the end of the day, it’s enough to make ends meet. And it does, and I never expected to be able to to that, 35 years into the band. I’m grateful for that to be honest.
Post-Punk: I am trying to find a good analogy for this, but I suppose you just simply have had an intimate relationship with your fans…
Edward Ka Spel: I consider them friends, I never call them fans!
Post-Punk: And there you have it, and most people had to scramble to do now. Not take people for granted and really connect with them. You’ve never had to make that transition, especially with Bandcamp.
Edward Ka Spel: That’s the good side of the world, especially with the internet age—it’s indeed a global community. There are a lot of good people out there, and they are connecting. It might be through the “evil” Facebook, or something like that, but that’s the good side of it. I am not on there very often, but with the Bandcamp, that is very personal, and I take it very seriously and have a lot of pride in it.
Post-Punk: It’s really amazing what you are doing. Putting out so much new material, and reissuing so much of your body of work. One last thing before I let you go. Do you still keep in touch with cEvin Key? I think last Tear Garden record, “Have a Nice Trip” was a couple of years ago.
Edward Ka Spel: I think the last time we recorded something was in 2008. There needs to be something more. With cEvin, we were having lots of contact recently, when the whole Netwerk thing came up.
Post-Punk: Will we be hearing from Lisa again?
Edward Ka Spel: That’s just basically my alter ego, which will be appearing again I’m sure. I mean—these things always do…

"A little too convoluted, but fun"
A fun story, but a bit too much going on. Also, the plot seemed to defy logic at.Although we don't believe in timing the market or panicking over market movements, we do like to keep an eye on big changes -- just in case they're material to our investing thesis.
What: Royal Caribbean Cruises (NYSE: RCL ) shares jumped 13% in early trading after the company released earnings.
So what: The company reported net income of $356.8 million, or $1.64 per share, up from $1.07 per share a year ago. It also increased guidance and said it would likely set an earnings record in 2011.
Now what: The high seas have been good to Royal Caribbean, and conditions look positive for the foreseeable future. Given the increased guidance, a forward price/earnings ratio of 14.3 is making this stock look relatively cheap. I always like to see an earnings beat followed by increased guidance, so I'm buying today's move higher.

Doug Garfieldwrote a review of Salomon X-ADV 6 Backcountry Boot on January 7, 2012
Salomon gets BC boot right
All the standard Salomon features here: cushy comfort, warm, well made, easy in and out. But the killer feature in my opinion is the easy, forefoot flex as you roll off the ski. There's no restriction as there is in the NNN BC set-ups. In combination with Salomon's robust Raid binding, it's a superb boot for off-track skiing. Mind you, it's not a turning machine (no system boot is); you'll need three-pin bindings and Garmont Excursions or something similar if this is your objective. But the binding is very secure for two-footed parallel turns on tame snow assuming a fairly narrow ski like a Madshus Eon or similar model (skis wider than 60-65 mm are tough to get on edge with system boots). I wouldn't hesitate to use this boot with the Raid binding on a traditional-length touring ski (something with a 50mm waist) for all-day comfort that will take you far from the parking lot.In a two-part series called “PS3 Fab-to-lab” on IBM’s awesome developerWorks website, [Lewin] explains how to use the Cell Broadband Engine in a PS3 to create an audio-bandwidth spectrum analyzer and function generator. The set up consists of Yellow Dog Linux, an NTSC television, and an external USB sound card to provide the inputs of the spectrum analyzer and the outputs of the function generator. The sound card driver is written to simply capture or send the info in question (audio range only) and the NTSC television as the graphical interface. This hack involves a lot of coding with hardly any example code provided. The article is more of a guide than anything. If anyone gets this working, let us know!

During the last PAX Prime, I was offered my dream job at the Behemoth, so it’s hard to top that. But still! Every PAX, I have even more amazing experience than the previous PAX. It just keeps getting better and better, it’s super scary even!
I’d like to thank whomever said “a picture is worth a thousand words” because that’s exactly what I’m doing, with a little notes for the event.
PAX Prime DAY 0: August 30, Thursday
We wanted to have the maximum amount of fun in Seattle before PAX so we left the San Diego Airport at 6:30 am and arrived in Seattle around 9:30 am. Fortunately we were able to check in at the hotel when we got there, so we dropped our stuff off and headed down to the Pike Place Market.
The weather couldn’t be better. It was sunny and gorgeous! I think it’s almost always sunny when we go to Seattle for PAX. Lucky us!
At night, we headed to the Triple Door to see Scott & Kris / Kris & Scott show by Scott Kurtz and Kris Straub. The place was pretty awesome. I loved the way people can sit anywhere & enjoy the show comfortably.
The show was absolutely hilarious. It was talk-show style, they had guests like LoadingReadyRun, Stephen “Stepto” Toulouse, Cards Against Humanity and Paul & Storm. Between each guest, they promoted fictional products by Card Kingdom, which is an actual card games store in Seattle and a sponsor of the show.
I got a new point & shoot camera pretty much for PAX because my old camera had dust in the lens causing the photos to have black spots. One of the cool features of this new camera is slow-motion video. I never thought I’d ever need it, but I used the feature during one of the “product commercials” just to see what it’d look like.
Here are some still shots.
It’s hard to show how funny it was with a still photo. But how about slow-motion?
Well, um, okay. The video was really dark, so I had Derek color-correct the footage and added some music, which made the entire thing a bit eerie.
After the show, we went back to the hotel, relaxed and went to bed for the first day of PAX Prime!
Day 1: August 31, Friday
We got up early and bought breakfast at Specialty’s CafÃ© & Bakery. Ever since our first PAX Prime, this place has been our favorite quick breakfast place. It’s right around the corner from the hotel and they have freshly baked stuff and soup. We usually buy food there and bring it back to the room, and eat it while getting ready.
After breakfast, we headed to the Keynote.
We spotted Robert Khoo checking the line for the Keynote. Right when he greeted us with a smile, a Penny Arcade fan asked him if he could sign his DreamCast. He gladly accepted and continued having a small talk with us while signing the DreamCast. Talk about multi-tasking. Or I’ll just call it “Khooing.”
We wished him luck for PAX, got in the line and soon we were inside the main theater.
Keynote with Ted Price
We left the hotel to get in the line for the Keynote by Ted Price, the CEO of Insomniac Games. I haven’t played too many of their games (Spyro the Dragon, Ratchet & Clank, etc…) but in this Keynote, he talked about developing a game, Â what kind of mistakes they made, and what they need to focus on/stick to when developing a game.
What I like about the Keynotes at PAX is that each keynote is very different from the other. Jane McGonigal’s keynote was more like a lecture (in a very good way) with slides and statisticsÂ on gaming and its positive affect on people’s emotions and life. Warren Spector talked about the gaming culture and how “casual gamers” would play an important role. Many people disagreed by loudly moaning at the theater back then but two years later, he was proven correct. David Jaffe talked passionately about his personal life and the legal issues he had to go through for his game.
That’s why we always go to the Keynote. It’s always something different and we learn interesting stuff about gaming culture, the process of game development & developers, etc.
We almost always stayed for the Q & A with Mike and Jerry right after the Keynote, but this time, we decided to go to Double Fine’s panel. I feel this year, PA put a lot of the big panels in the same timeslot…
We still had a little bit of time so we walked around the Exhibitor’s hall for a while.
Yes, I work for this company! And yes, I still visit their (our) booth and take photos like a fan girl.
While we were sitting and waiting for the panel to begin, I saw a tweet, saying that during Q & A, they made an announcement about another PAX and that it’d be in Australia.
O_O < AUSTRALIA?!?!?!
Many Penny Arcade fans knew that there’d be a new PAX. In fact at the past SDCC during the panel with Mike and Jerry, two people (one from Texas and one from Australia) asked about the possibility of new PAX. I was not at the panel but Derek was, and he told me that Mike put Robert on the spot by saying “Can I say anything?” Then he saidÂ something along the lines of “Yes, there’ll be another PAX and it’ll be somewhere near you”, so we totally thought the new PAX would be Austin. Never thought it’d be in Australia.
Anyway, as while we searched for more information about PAX Australia on our phones, the next panel started.
Double Fine Adventure Panel featuring Tim Schafer & Greg Rice (Double Fine), Paul Levering (2 Player Productions), and Cindy Au (Kickstarter)
After Double Fine raised more than 3 million dollars in Kickstarter to create a point and click adventure game, they’ve been updating the project with 2 Player Productions. Derek and I are both backers and could not miss this chance to see this panel. They showed footage from the series so far and part of a new episode of from the documentary for their Kickstarter, then had a Q & A.
There were some interesting questions about how the money is being spent, etc… You can watch the entire panel thanks to Twitch.tv.
PAX Prime 2012 – The Double Fine Adventure Adventure! Part 1
PAX Prime 2012 – The Double Fine Adventure Adventure! Part 2
PAX Prime 2012 – The Double Fine Adventure Adventure! Part 3
After the panel, we went back to the exhibitor’s floor and walked around some more. Derek played a lot of new games at SDCC (DMC, Okami HD, Tomb Raider, Resident Evil 6, Transformers: Fall of Cybertron, Sleeping Dogs, Halo 4, etc…), so we didn’t have to line up for those which saved us a lot of time. We still checked which booths we want to come back to, so here are more photos!!
Derek refused to check out to the Last of Us booth. He wants to see NOTHING until he plays the game.
And we headed to the next panel.
Afternoon with Kris and Scott
Unfortunately, Kris Straub and Scott Kurtz did not have a late night panel during this PAX. At their past late night panels at PAX, there was some alcohol, alcoholic whipped cream, tears and laughter. Maybe even punching and slapping. But this time, it was a good clean fun time. Well, Scott did re-tell the bathroom story, which is our favorite, but it didn’t go on until 2 in the morning. It was still hilarious though!
After our last panel for the day, we headed to the exhibit hall and walked quickly around the floor before they closed it off for an evening mixer.
The Warner Bros. Booth had this strange screens hanging from the ceiling. I felt like they'd come down and chop us up like blades.
"Octodad" was probably our most favorite indie game at PAX Prime 2012 - "Only a real human would wear an awesome shirt." I bought it, because I'm a real human and awesome.
After attendees were gone, many exhibitors stopped by at the Behemoth booth to play BattleBlock Theater and Castle Crashers during the mixer!
Even Enforcers were lining up to play the awesome arcade cabinet! (after their work hours, of course)
We hung out there for a bit and the it was already the time for us to go to the VGO (Video Game Orchestra) concert!
Friday night concert by V.G.O (Video Game Orchestra)
We’ve been huge fans of VGO since the first time we saw them at the very first PAX East in 2010. We love them because they don’t just play the video game music but they really put a lot of time and effort into arranging each piece. You really can feel the love and respect that Shota, the founder of VGO, puts into his orchestra.
The concert was a blast and it was over before we knew it… We had no idea what the VGO was planning back then. But I’ll write about that after finishing PAX Prime posts.
We came back to the hotel, and relaxed for a while. We went to sleep fairly early to prepare for the two more days at PAX Prime.
To be continued to PAX Prime 2012 : Day 2 ~ 3!!

If I just get the springs and leave the rest as it is, I will not need to do anything else to the car. That is according to them now. Any thoughts about that?
I am so very tempted to start saving for a set of springs and maybe even better shocks. Lenny where did you get your springs from and how much were they shipped if you don't mind me asking? Any suggestions for shocks and where to get them? My only issue is whether the car will be too low to the ground and would scrape going over speed bumps. I reckon the car would look quite good as well sitting a bit lower.
Hi mate,
i purchased my eibach kit from ford on ebay. Finis1358918 (for 1.6TDCi, 1.8TDCi and 2.0TDCi)
Buying from ford doesnt effect your warrenty if ford fit them or you have an invoice to say you bought from ford. Which you will have if you buy like i did, or from your local dealership. Ive void all my warrentys at this stage but its good to know ford stand by the product and supply it.
Here is where i bought mine.
Deliverd by GLS but their not blue when they arrive their gloss black so will match your car even better.
I doubt your car will scrape since ford offer the kit as an optional extra but it will sit 40mm from centre wheel cap to centre tip of fender.
Their also selling ford focus 18" rims set of four 400 pounds in both silver or chrome finish, would match in well
But your existing alloys look good enough to me, and like you said the extra profile helps,
Id also recommend fitting the eibach camber adjustment kit, from Performance3000
Cheaper than a tyre and will keep all four wearing evenly after lowering.
Also regarding shocks/Dampers
The bilstein B4 kit also from Performance3000 looks like a fantastic offer,
But im not sure if the B4 kit is a stock spec kit or an upgrade from stock spec
Great price though,
A great video regarding lowering the car is this one lolLeeds sex tonight, nude pussy area, wanting sex in springhill, pusy in klerksdorp, lesbian their clothes massage canter on images, fighting in cape town, girls in canada massage canter to go to adult club lesbian in mcallen texas.

Professor DeeAnn Reeder, left in Bucknell T-shirt, and senior Megan Vodzak this summer in Sudan.

Posted May 12, 2008
Updated July 22, 2008
LEWISBURG, Pa. -- Undergraduate summer research projects will take Bucknell University students around the globe -- from Central Pennsylvania and a remote mountain base camp in Alaska to the north African country of Sudan.
The undergraduate research crosses the breadth of the University's academic disciplines -- from biology and English to biomedical engineering and animal behavior.
Megan Vodzak, a senior neuroscience major from Dallas, Pa., may well be traveling the greatest distance from campus to reach her summer research post.
Documenting populations
She'll be in southern Sudan, near the Ugandan border, with DeeAnn Reeder, assistant professor of biology, to document mammal populations. A particular focus of their research will be native bats. || Audio: Megan Vodzak in her own words
The animal population of southern Sudan "hasn't been surveyed in more than 50 years due to civil war," said Vodzak. "It's interesting to be able to go there now and see what species are there and maybe describe new species as well as see what species have left the area and what species have come to the area."
As part of her preparation for the three-week trip, Vodzak, who will sleep in a hut draped with mosquito netting, will prepare a picture book of known local species that will be used to help the local population identify area wildlife. Information obtained from this field trip may be used as part of an application for a research grant from National Geographic for additional study.
Bat research lab
Working with bats is nothing new for the neuroscience major. Since her sophomore year, she has worked in Bucknell's bat research lab. "My training with trapping and handling the bats will be applicable, though I'm sure I'll be handling some larger species than just a little brown bat," said Vodzak.
While Sudan remains in the news headlines, she said much of the country's strife is centered in Darfur in the north and the area she will be visiting has been relatively stable since factional fighting ended several years ago.
Vodzak's research project, which she calls "an opportunity of a lifetime," is just one aspect of Bucknell undergraduate research taking place this summer. A sampling of summer research projects includes:
Bucknell's Program for Undergraduate Research provides up to 20 summer stipends of $2,500 and campus housing to students to conduct eight-week research projects with faculty mentors..Tags: self storage, central self storage, morningstsr minisorage, pegasus group, self storage industry

Les Kurbas street is a small street near the city center. The most important stakeholders on it are Les Kurbas theatre, trade center, restaurants, hostels, shops and apartments.
Before the renovation street was completely occupied by parked cars and there was no public activity.
After the renovation street was made pedestrian with one level surface and splited into three main functional zones - restaurant zone, public zone with benches and bicycle parking and parking zone for the local inhabitants.
Six catalpa trees were planted into the concrete tubes to protect commucations from the roots and with drainage system which made to bring air and water into the soil.
All works were made in financial cooperation of city administration with local business and tenants.

AbstractHeat capacities of K2Mg2(SO4)3 (langbeinite) and CaSO4 (anhydrite) were measured from approximately 8 to 1000 K by combined adiabatic shield calorimetry (8-365 K) and differential scanning calorimetry (350-1000 K). Heat capacities were also measured on natural crystals of gypsum (CaSO4 ?? 2H2O) between 8.1 and 323.5 K. The molar entropies at 298.15 K, Smo(298.15 K), are 378.8 ?? 0.6, 107.4 ?? 0.2 and 193.8 ?? 0.3 J K-1 mol-1 for langbeinite, anhydrite and gypsum, respectively. The heat capacity in J K-1 mol-1 of langbeinite can be represented by the equation Cp,mo(K2Mg2(SO4 )3T) = 535.9 + 0.11011T-1.0200 ?? 106/T2-4.909 ?? 10-5T2 -4040.2/T0.5 between 300 and 1000 K with an average deviation of ?? 0.4%. For anhydrite the heat capacity between 300 and 1000 K is given by Cp,mo(CaSO4,T) = 372.8 - 0.1574 T +1.695 ?? 106/T2 + 7.993 ?? 10-5T2 - 4330.8/T0.5 with an average deviation of ??0.4%. Combining our heat-capacity and entropy data with the solution calorimetric results of Kelley et al. (U.S. Bur. Mines Tech. Paper, 625, 1941) yields an equilibrium temperature for the reaction gypsum ??? anhydrite + 2 water of 314.7 K (41.5 ?? C). Our observations are in agreement with the conclusions of Speer and Salje (Phys. Chem. Miner., 13 (1986) 17); we see no evidence in our heat capacity measurements for the transformation of cubic langbeinite (P213) to a low temperature orthorhombic (P212121) form as is seen in the isostructural Co, Zn, Ca, Mn and Cd langbeinites. Although Bond (Bell Sys. Tech. J., 22 (1943) 145) reported that langbeinite was piezoelectric at room temperature, we found no evidence in our Cpo measurements for a Curie temperature above which langbeinite would no longer be piezoelectric. ?? 1989.

I love books.
"Magnificient!"
I'm sure I'll listen to The Scorpio Races again. I loved it when I read it, and I loved it again when I heard it told to me via audiobook.
I love all the relationships and characters in this story. The island of Thisby is a character all its own and has very different relationships with all who live on it. Sean Kendrick and Puck Connolly are wonderful protagonists who I came to care deeply about along with the other Connolly children, George Holley, and of course, Dove and Corr.
I thought both narrators were perfectly cast. Since I read the book before I listened to it, I already had an idea of what the characters sounded like. I felt that the voices in my head were just more realistically expressed when I listed to the book.
There were several lines in this story that made me tear up as I read them and again as I listened to them. Some just because they were beautiful expressions of a concept. Stiefvater's exquisite use of language expresses the character's emotions so well, that I would find it impossible not to feel along with them.
"A lovely story, well narrated"
Another enjoyable book by Maggie Stiefvater. She paints a detailed picture of life on the fantasy island of Thisby where men race unpredictable, and often deadly, capaill uisce ( waterhorses) at the annual Scorpio Races. The book has elements of fantasy without going too far, so you can still relate to the characters in the story. Overall, a fun "read", well narrated, a good love story, and a well written, strong, female lead character.
"Unexpected"
I didn't read the book, just listened to the audio.
This was better than I expected! As a mid-30's mom, I love the gentle fantasy style of stories, such as Twilight. I like the fantasy, a touch of romance, humor...but nothing that would be disturbing! As this generally falls into the category of young adult fiction, often the plot can be a little on the thin side.Therefore, I was pleasantly surprised at the Scorpio Races. It kept me guessing, right up until the end of the book. There wasn't predictable romance, on every page.....the characters were nicely human (believable), but charming. I wondered how they would really solve all of their problems, and liked the fact that not every little issue had a tidy ending. Some were actually left, for us to ponder over, but not in a disturbing way. We were left, feeling like maybe the big brother was a bit flaky, if understandably so. The younger brother had a mental illness, which was accurately depicted. (I have O.C.D., and can attest to this.) No one ever came out and mentioned it; it was just a part of their lives, and despite his flaws, this character was sweet and charming! So we are left with the idea that, while the family members were imperfect, they could all still be a family, and love one another. This was refreshing.Also, I am so impressed by the author's musical talents! I was left, wanting a c.d., after listening to the music, that introduced and ended the story.:)This was a nice listen, that I would recommend! I should offer a warning, that there are some not-so-gentle, bloody parts...I am very sensitive, but I did survive~ and it didn't outweight the nice parts of the story.
"Great narration strategy"
The story is interesting, mysterious and compelling. I also thought the narration approach was very clever (alternating between the male and female protagonists in the novel and in the audio). The narrators were spot-on and I enjoyed this audio book immensely.
"Wonderful storytelling!"
deep. romantic. wonderfully terrible.
Loved the development of the relationship between Shawn and Puck. Their inability to recognize it in themselves made it even that more endearing.
First time, but look forward to more!
Totally cried at the end, not gonna lie.
I wasn't a huge fan of Stiefvater's Shiver trilogy. I liked that she took a different route w/ the mythology but some of the behaviors of the heroine got old after three books. There was none of that in this book. Both characters, heck, all characters have their strengths and their flaws but they're real, and true to themselves. No room for wishy-washy. I'm glad this was a single title, not sure I could have waited for a conclusion. I wouldn't mind revising these characters and the Island in the future though. Keeping my fingers crossed.
Coffee and a Book Chick
"Awesome Irish Mythology w/ Fantastic Narrators!"
Fantasy and/or dystopian novels are just  YA. Additionally, Maggie Stiefvater plays the instruments throughout the audio which was wonderful, and her Afterword was a delight to listen to, particularly as she trails off with laughter in the end...
reads for teens
"Even if you hate fairy stories, read this!"
I was determined to not read this story. I don't like fairy stories and I'm not keen on animal tales either, but so many good things had been written about this book I gave it a chance. I fell in love with the written story, so I had to listen to it as well. It is now an all time favorite of mine and I am always pointing people in the direction or this wonderful novel.The story follows Puck (Kate) and Sean, and is told in their alternating points of view. They are both competing in the annual Scorpio Races; a dangerous, free for all race involving captured fairy horses. Puck is not only the first girl to ever compete in the races, but she plans on riding her non-magical island pony. Puck is trying to save her family home and Sean hopes to win the ownership of Corr, the sea horse he has won the race with in the past. Instead of becoming adversaries, they begin training together and learning from one another. The contrast in their personalities is sharply drawn. Puck is brash, irrepressible, and always willing to pick a fight; whereas Sean is a quiet but strong presence at all times. My favorite scene that shows the contrast is when they wish each other luck before the race.The rest of the novel works as well, from the setting (an island with a distinctly Irish feel), to the supporting characters. You feel as though Ms. Stiefvater just took up residence there, sat around the pub and listened to local folklore. The actors who read the parts did a wonderful job. They never tried to take over or overact the roles. They just let the story flow in it's own elegant manner.This kept me surprised up to the very last line and had me thinking about it for days. It is Ms. Stiefvater's best work yet.
I am a book junkie...I read and enjoy a variety of stories, so please don't "define me" by one book or review! :)
"This Author Returns With Her A-Game!"
This is a wonderful story that really represents Ms. Siefvater at her very best. The narrative is very vivid and picturesque, accomplishing the author's goal of making you feel like you are there. It is very artful and lyrical, reading almost like poetry. There are some more dramatic scenes that stand out as they are meant to, but the overall style of this story is very, very subtle, and is all the more powerful and compelling for it. The characters say very little out loud but their actions tell us volumes about them, and the relationship(s) developing between the characters are understated but certainly not to be under-rated as the story conveys the growing strength of those bonds. The narration is excellent, portraying both the reticence of the characters and the emotion and excitement of the more dramatic scenes. The accents and narration overall seemed pretty much perfect for the characters. I'm not even a horse-enthusiast, and if I fell in love with this story in which horses play such a large part, you know it must be great!
"Fascinating from the very first word"
I absolutely loved this story! The narrators, Steve West and Fiona Hardingham, did a fantastic job drawing you into the story. I'll definitely be listen this story.BLOG: What if Steve Jobs is right?
No Surrender
There is some additional evidence to support the quotes from the Steve Jobs biography. Intellectual property and patent analyst Florian Mueller recently uncovered information from legal filings in the case between Apple and Samsung in Australia that demonstrate that Apple is not interested in collecting a licensing fee. It wants the infringing products banned, and its intellectual property protected, and it has no intention of selling it to Samsung, HTC, or anyone else for a few dollars per unit.
A blog post from Mueller outlines in detail some of the passages from testimony that show Apple's commitment to defending its patents. Mueller sums up with, "Apple is prepared to give Android device makers a license to "some lower level patents" but it wants to reserve various design elements and functionalities exclusively for iOS."
What If?
I am not a lawyer, nor am I a patent attorney. I am admittedly speculating.
In general, I agree that patent litigation is getting out of hand. It has become a standard operating procedure and part of the normal business model for hardware and software makers.
I don't agree with patent trolling, or using patent litigation as a strategic weapon to stifle competition. However, I do support the defense of patents and intellectual property that are legitimately being infringed upon. What if the Android OS and the devices it runs on actually infringe on patents held by Apple?
There is no denying that Android has been a tremendous success in smartphones. It has stumbled (repeatedly) out of the starting gate in tablets, but I imagine it will eventually make up ground and one day surpass Apple's iOS in that arena as well. But, it is possible that Android owes its success to concepts and technologies it does not have a legal right to make use of.
If a company came out with a new cola beverage that tasted just like Coca Cola, and its sales surpassed those of the iconic beverage giant we might put that company on a pedestal as a shining example of American ingenuity and commitment to excellence. But, if we later found out that the new cola only exists because its founders served on the board of Coca Cola and literally stole the secret formula for Coke, our opinion of that beverage and the success of that company would change dramatically.
The fact that Android is successful should not have any weight on determining whether it achieved that success by violating Apple patents. The impact an injunction against Android devices might have on the smartphone market should not be sufficient to excuse profiting from the theft of intellectual property.

Maximilian Schell: The Actor of the Millenium
By Karen Melissa Graham
The best actors are the ones whose names always seem to escape us. Even when, from character to character, there is little or no variation in make-up or costume we never stop and think "Oh look! It's that actor," or even, "Now what have I seen this person in before?" Instead, you "meet" the character.
Maximilian Schell is such an actor. Only after viewing a few dozen of his films do you finally make the connection that the name "Maximilian Schell" seems to keep showing up in the credits. Even if you have chosen to view a film because it "stars Maximilian Schell," the actor steps aside so that the character may live a life of his own.
A Brief Look at the Ensemble Actor in Two Films
Ensemble Acting: An approach to acting that aims for a unified effect achieved by all members of a cast working together on behalf of the play, rather than emphasizing individual performances (infoplease.com dictionary)
This ability to completely understand the character and work as part of the ensemble is what makes the audience empathize with the character and believe the story.
The crime comedy Topkapi, directed by Jules Dassin in 1964, is a fun example of how an ensemble cast should interact in harmony with each other in even the most unexpected and ridiculous situations. In comedy it is tempting to sit back and let the script do all the work, but the Topkapi cast of misfits each give their character depth and a subconscious view into personal history. This is most important during the long scenes without dialogue. Simple, subtle glances and gestures are all that is needed for the hilarity to flow and keep the audience holding their breath and resisting the urge to blink.
As the charming criminal mastermind Walter Harper, Maximilian Schell shares the screen with legends Peter Ustinov, Robert Morely, and Greek siren Melina Mercouri. Each character has their own individual role to play in the theft at Istanbul's Topkapi Museum. Each character is played with their own distinctive personality, each character played by a brilliant actor, each actor taking their role beyond what is written and humanizing what would otherwise be cartoon characters and thereby reacting naturally with each other as the situations dictate. Maximilian Schell, and Melina Mercouri as Elizabeth Lipp, certainly have the more difficult roles to play. As both actors provide the obvious sex appeal their characters could have easily become shallow and dominate the film. However, both actors have their characters so finely tuned they easily accomplish the more difficult task of applying the method in the madness.
Though the film Judgment at Nuremberg, directed by Stanely Kramer in 1961, is yet another obvious example of an ensemble and even "All Star" cast, Maximilian Schell demonstrates another aspect of an ensemble actor. Even in this earlier stage of Maximilian Schell's film career you see where he has a real sense for the script, the message, the direction, even the lights, and camera. When the ensemble of writer, director, photographer, sound, set, editor, costume, make-up, and actor have such an understanding of not just their jobs, but each other's as well, the results are so seamless and natural you have no idea who to give credit to. Even more, you are no longer an audience member watching a film, but you have become a fly on the wall of an intense drama unfolding before your eyes. Judgment at Nuremberg, written by Abby Mann and based on Mann's original script for television's Playhouse 90, is a serious courtroom drama based on the actual war crime trials in Nuremberg after the fall of the Nazi regime. One of the difficulties of filming such a drama would be the language barrier between the American prosecutors and the German defendants. From the beginning several points are made to establish the role played by the translators. I appreciate the fact that this language barrier was not ignored. Hollywood loves to pretend that everyone speaks English. However, 1960's film audiences would not have had the attention span to sit through a film that is 50% subtitles. Here is where our ensemble first truly begins to shine. As Col. Tad Lawson, Prosecuting Attorney, Richard Widmark gives the prosecutor's opening statements with just the right amount of All American Justice. As the Lead Defense Attorney Hans Rolfe, played by Maximilian Schell, steps up to make his opening statements the initial reaction is "what could this baby faced German lawyer possibly have to say in defense of these four former judges now on trial." Once again Maximilian Schell, before saying a word, uses his own private thoughts to telepathically convey to the audience his character's emotions and intentions. Rather than automatically declare a personal verdict of "guilty," the audience is on the edge of their seats waiting to hear the other side of the story. Now with the actor in place the rest of the ensemble moves in. As Hans Rolfe begins his statements in his native German, the audience's point of view is sitting with the translator in his box as he repeats, in English, line by line the German words spoken by Rolfe. The feeling is very tense as the meaning behind the German words are revealed to the audience just as the words are revealed to the Americans in the courtroom. However, you already know that to continue at this pace is impractical. Your point of view, as Hans Rolfe continues in German, has you slowly rising out of the translator's box with your sight never straying from the young attorney. Suddenly the camera zooms in closely on Maximilian Schell's face as he, without missing a beat, flawlessly switches from speaking German to English. The effect is impressive, yet subtle enough so that you are not distracted from what is being said.
Beyond Nuremberg
Topkapi and Judgment at Nuremberg are only two examples of Maximilian Schell's lifetime of performing on the stage and screen. His amazing talent and range as an actor has led to a spectacular variety of roles in over 80 feature films and television films and countless live theatre performances. Maximilian Schell not only played Hans Rolfe in Stanley Kramer's Judgment at Nuremberg, but also played the same role in Abby Mann's original production for television's Playhouse 90. In 2001, Maximilian Schell once again performed in Abby Mann's Judgment at Nuremberg. This time on Broadway in the role of Ernst Janning. Maximilian Schell was also three times lucky in the title role of William Shakespeare's Hamlet. In 1960, Maximilian Schell played the troubled Dane in Franz Peter Wirth's adaptation of Hamlet for German television. Maximilian Schell would again play the same role in two separate productions for live theatre. It was in one of these productions that Maximilian Schell not only starred as Hamlet, but directed the production as well. He is deservedly considered one of the greatest Hamlets ever.
Film has seen Maximilian Schell in every role imaginable, and his status as an attractive leading man can not be denied. Even in later years, Maximilian Schell still possesses the charming warm smile, dark features and sparkling eyes that have singled him out as one of the sexiest men to ever grace the silver screen. However, it is always the intelligence and dignity that Maximilian Schell brings to every character that has established one of the longest and most successful careers of any other actor. It has also helped that Maximilian Schell realizes the world stretches beyond Hollywood, California. This multi-lingual actor has performed in as many English speaking films as he has performed in his native German language. His German language films include: Ein Mädchen aus Flandern (1956), Die Letzten werden die Ersten sein (1957), Taxichauffer Bänz (1957), Die Bernauerin (1958), Der Seiden Schuh (1965), Justiz (1993), Zwishen Rosen (1997), Fisimatenten (2000), Liebe, Lügen, Leiderschaft (2002).
English language films include: The Young Lions (1958), Five Finger Exercise (1962), Return From the Ashes (1965), The Man in the Glass Booth (1975), Julia (1977), The Black Hole (1979), The Chosen (1981), Stalin (1992), Coast to Coast (2003). Other foreign language films include French and Italian. (For more titles featuring Maximilian Schell, see our Amazon.com ads to the left)
Unfortunately, I have never had the honor of seeing Maximilian Schell perform in live theatre. Therefore, I can not offer personal insight into this aspect of the actor's career. Based on reviews I have read, it is clear that Maximilian Schell has mastered the skill required to conquer both stage and screen. A much more difficult task than some would imagine, as there is quite a difference between the two mediums.
Behind the Camera
Perhaps it is only natural that such a multi-talented man would inevitably excel at all aspects of the arts and entertainment. In 1968 Maximilian Schell co-produced and starred in Franz Kafka's Das Schloß. In 1970 he produced, wrote, directed, and starred in the critically acclaimed Erst Liebe. The award winning drama Der Fußgänger, in 1973, would also see Maximilian Schell as actor, writer, director, and producer.
Unlike most actors who attempt technical as well as acting careers, Maximilian Schell has never allowed multi-tasking to stretch his talents too thin. Instead, having more control over projects has allowed him to grow as a performer and artist. After other fictional dramas such as Der Richter und sein Henker (1975), and Geschichter aus dem Wienerwald (1979) Maximilian Schell ventured into documentaries. His award winning and immensely popular Marlene (1984), on the life of Marlene Dietrich, proved his talent as a documentary filmaker, but it is the more recent documentary Meine Schwester Maria (2002) that has earned him the most praise, not just praise as an outstanding filmmaker, but praise from a much more important critic, Maximilian Schell's older sister, Maria Schell. Meine Schwester Maria is the touching and personal tribute to the beautiful Maria Schell, an acting legend in her own right.
Extending himself even farther, Maximilian Schell continued to stay close to his roots in the theatre, not just by continuing to act on stage, but also directing, spending five years with the Salzberg Festival. It would be Maximilian Schell's critically acclaimed musical talents as a pianist that would see him to direct and produce live operas like Lohengrim for the Los Angeles Opera. Most recently, Maximilian Schell worked on the film project Beethovens Fidelio with Placido Domingo and Kent Nagamo.
Whether he is at the piano, in front of or behind the camera, on stage or in the director's chair, or all of the above, Maximilian Schell has never experienced a lull in his career, and fortunately for audiences he has no intentions of slowing down.
Dr. Maximilian Schell
Born in Vienna, Austria to Swiss writer Hermann Ferdinand Schell and the Austrian actress Margarethe Noe von Nordberg, Maximilian Schell began acting at an early age with brother Carl and sisters Immy and Maria. Although the talented siblings were all born in their mother's homeland Austria, their parents hatred for Hitler would force Hermann Ferdinand Schell to escape with his family back to his native Switzerland. Attending three different universities, Maximilian Schell excelled in his studies of art, language and music. These skills would follow him on to the stage, screen and throughout all of his legendary achievements. The multi-talented musician, artist, writer, producer, director, actor received an Honorary Doctorate from Spertus College of Judaica in Chicago, and has been a guest professor at the University of Southern California.
Applauding Maximilian Schell
Even though Maximilian Schell can actually be overshadowed by his own talent, making audiences perhaps take the man himself for granted, his peers have taken notice.
Maximilian Schell has quite possibly won every award created and has had every possible honor bestowed upon him, and deservedly so. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has nominated Maximilian Schell for several awards. In 1961, Maximilian Schell won the Academy's award for Best Actor in a Leading Role for his work in Judgment at Nuremberg. For this same role Maximilian Schell would also win the BAFTA film award and the Golden Globe. In 1993 he would again win the Golden Globe, this time for Best Supporting Actor for his role as Vladimir Lenin in the television movie Stalin. Maximilian Schell would also twice win the New York Film Critic's Circle Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role in Julia (1977), and again for Best Actor in Judgment at Nuremberg. Maximilian Schell's films Der Richter und sein Henker and Erst Liebe would each win the Silver Seashell at the San Sebastian International Film Festival. In 2000, Mikhail Gorbachev awarded Maximilian Schell the Men's World Award for World Achievements. In 2002, at the BAMBI Awards, Maximilian Schell stood on stage next to his lovely sister Maria as they were both honored for lifetime achievements and in recognition for the film Meine Schwester Maria.
The awards mentioned here are just a few of the many honors bestowed upon Maximilian Schell, who somehow manages to stay humble through it all.
At the Baltic Pearl Film Festival in 2000, Maximilian Schell was declared The Actor of the Millennium. No other actor desrves this title more, and with a career that shows no signs of slowing down, and with so many more stories to tell, no doubt at the turn of the next millennia Maximilian Schell will again be so honored.

I recently visited the Portland Mini Maker Faire with my family on Sunday, September 11, 2016. We had been to the Portland Mini Maker Faire in 2014 as well and it was a lot of fun. This one was equally inspiring for my maker spirit, and there were a lot of fun activities for my kids to do as well.
It was held on the grounds of the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry (OMSI) right beside the Willamette River.
Visitors entering the Faire-grounds were greeted by the fabulous vision of a steampunk R2-D2 pulling a stagecoach that oscillated like a bucking bronco. One person could ride inside the R2-D2 device as it rolled around. It looked like the stagecoach was offering rides to some visitors as well.
And now, without further ado, let's enter together this photo blog together - the marvelous world of the Portland Mini Maker Faire. (Find out more about Maker Faires in your area at.)
Robot Critters
Homage to Babbage
You can almost hear the click-clack of turning cogs and gears inside these gorgeous steampunk computers, complete with real working keyboards and mice.
Steampunk Hovercraft
With a leather air skirt, wooden hull, and gorgeous copper and brass adornments, the Nemotoad is part Captain Nemo and part amphibious vehicle. If only there had been a video of it in action!
Compressed Air Vehicles
The presenter at this booth has chosen bicycles as a simple test vehicle for compressed air propulsion. If it works out, it may be possible to scale up to larger vehicles.
3, 2, 1, Blast off!
This booth invited kids to make their own paper rockets. A team member pumped up the air pressure and the kids got to count down and push the button that launched their paper rocket high into the air. Some of them even reached the freeway overpass up above.
Giant Drone
Race your own CNC car
This booth by CNC Router Parts had a couple of CNC routers set up turning wood blanks into various styles of cars. The team members then helped kids color and decorate their cars and hammer on the plastic wheels with metal nail axels.
After that they invited the kids over to the race track to watch them shoot down the ramp and past the finish line which recorded whose car came in first.
Millenium Falcnc
This booth featured the Millenium Falcon and lots of other models, art, and trinkets all cut out with laser cutters.
Whiteboard drawing robot
Groovy Ride
Goal!
The soccer robot was a great hit with the kids. It could stop and grab the ball, maneuver, spin in crazy circles, and spit the ball back out to an excited child. There were also robots that could shoot balls into holes in a tall tower structure.
Camper Time
After looking at these beautiful campers, you might be inspired to build your own!
Pegboard Marble Run
With a pegboard, some pipe insulation, and a few marbles, your kids can have hours of fun, as demonstrated by this marble run.
Pirates... ahem... Privateers, Ahoy!
These piratey cosplayers were serving up information about seafaring and cannons, as well as testing players perceptiveness with a shell game.
Honey Makers
Beekeepers from BeeThinking gave a talk on beekeeping as well as giving tastes of various kinds of honey. If you're in the Portland area you can sign up for classes on beekeeping.
Make a difference with InStove
The Art of Maker Faire
Metalwork
Things weren't only high-tech at the Mini Maker Faire. There were also lots of booths presenting traditional arts and crafts, including blacksmithing and jewelry making.
Pottery
There was a pottery booth where kids were encouraged to try their hand at making their own vessels and sculptures.
Scribbling Machines
This booth let visitors construct their own scribbling bots. When put down on the provided paper, they began to create a kind of semi-random artwork. Check out the instruction pages and build your own!
Shoemaker
Making Machines
Various booths had their making machines on display, including CNC machines, 3D printers, and even the Sphere Bot which does a great job decorating eggs.
Other Maker Projects
Other maker projects from one makerspace included a water pump, a canoe, and terrain for tabletop RPG gaming.
Bifurcating Penny Mosaic
This machine uses a scanner to separate light from dark pennies. It then uses switches to send them down a bifurcating path to a series of columns below where they form monochrome pictures like Abraham Lincoln's iconic face.
Perfect Ratio Guitar Fretting
Lots of applied mathematics to the science of music here, plus some beautiful craftsmanship. Check out the write-up of designing Just Intonation and Fretted Instruments.
Robot Art
Zenpressions
These beautiful ceramic balls each have different patterns embossed on their surfaces. When you roll them around in the sand, you can create beautiful tracks and trails. They had a sand box set up for kids to use too. Check out Olander Earthworks for more info.
LED Throwies
This booth was set up to let kids make their own LED throwies, or LED badges that they could wear on their shirts. It's a fun activity for the kids to see that they can make a basic electronic gadget with a colorful LED, a button battery, and a magnet.
Spare Parts Store
Some people were selling their creations, and there was this store selling surplus parts, with some examples of what you can create.
Geometric Building Kit
Ancestral Technologies
Trackers, Anvil Academy, and a few other groups were demonstrating ancestral technologies such as archery, firemaking, foraging, blacksmithing, barrel making, and so on.
Cardboard Costumes
This booth let visitors create their own costumes and props out of cardboard, as well as exhibiting some of their master-craft creation.
Velcro LED Throwie Wall
This giant black fabric wall was covered with LED throwies. Instead of the normal magnet, these had velcro attached. Visitors could arrange them in patterns to make pictures and words, as well as stand back and toss them for target practice.
Twisty Tubes and Tunnels
The Portland Children's Museum set up this space where visitors could construct their own ball tunnel contraptions and then run wooden balls and ping pong balls down through them. Loads of fun for the kids.
Faire Well!
We spent about 3 hours at the Mini Maker Faire and had a great time with a 5-year-old, 3-year-old, and 5-week-old in tow. The older kids had a great time with all the activities and we adults marveled at people's creativity and the beautiful things they'd made.
I highly recommend checking out a Maker Faire or Makerspace in your area. Get inspired and get making!Narrow your search

Old mail from the week, newspapers, dust bunnies, dishes and other stuff can accumulate pretty fast. The weekend is a good time to clean up -- and make some space for some new speakers.
Thankfully, Amazon is kicking off the week with a speaker deal that won't take up too much of that newfound space, all without taking too much of the cash in your wallet! We found the Mirage MX 5.1 Channel Miniature High-Performance Speaker System listed on Amazon through Electronics Expo for just $449. This is one of Amazon's third-party merchants, but Amazon actually fulfills the order. Order through them and you'll save over 60% ($750!) off the list price of this full speaker set. The purchase price even includes free shipping. Find out more about this set as well as the deal on Amazon's product page:
This set makes it easy to add Mirage into any area of the house. It has five small satellite speakers, all of which are about the size of your palm. That compact size makes it easy to stuff the speakers into almost any corner or shelf. That said, you're probably going to want to put them out on display. Not only are they cool looking, but the sound will (literally) blow you away.
Each one of the speakers features Mirage's own Omnipolar Technology, which is designed to deliver wide sound in a variety of listening spaces. Rounding out the set is Mirage's MM-6 subwoofer, which includes an 800-watt integrated amplifier, dual 6.5-inch black anodized aluminum passive radiators, and a 6.5-inch black anodized aluminum cone woofer. And all this bass goodness is packed into an 8-inch cube!
Don't forget that you'll need to order the Mirage set through Electronics Expo or one of the other Marketplace sellers to get the discount as well as the free shipping. There's no word on when this deal will end, but it's a good one, so you'd better act fast before the retailer sells out of stock!

The single, easiest way to keep track of all the stocks that matter...
Your own personalized stock watchlist!
It's a 100% FREE Motley Fool service...
With all the crazy moves the market has made lately, it's no wonder that so many people are confused about where stocks will go next. But rather than spending a lot of time and effort trying to guess the market's next zig, you're far better off following a plan that will work no matter where stocks go in the coming weeks and months.
No timing beats bad timing
The last two years have brought market moves that have left many investors completely shellshocked. Even though people thought they understood the risks involved with investing in stocks, the reality of the plunge that lopped off more than half of the S&P 500's value between late 2007 and early 2009 scared a lot of investors completely out of the market.
Since then, the market has caromed wildly between awe-inspiring rallies and stomach-churning drops that brought back memories of the worst days of the financial crisis. On the whole, though, stocks have earned back a big chunk of what they lost. Yet unfortunately, it's only now, after such huge gains have already been made, that many investors are starting to feel comfortable getting back into the stock market again. Although stocks may yet continue to rise from here, there are no guarantees -- and all too often in the past, the general public has piled back into an investment at exactly the wrong time.
Stop guessing and invest!
The worst thing about the dilemma that those who are still on the sidelines face is that they've gotten themselves sidetracked from a winning strategy. It's true that the market averages over the past 10 years haven't performed well, leaving many to conclude that long-term investing is only for suckers. But if you followed these three steps, you still made money over the long haul -- even in the lousiest period for stocks in generations.
1. Keep investing, no matter what the market does.
When stocks fall, your gut tells you to stop putting more money into the market. After all, throwing good money after bad feels like exactly the wrong move.
But your experience back in early 2009 should show you just how wrong your gut is when it comes to investing at market bottoms. For instance, Sirius XM Radio (Nasdaq: SIRI ) and JDS Uniphase (Nasdaq: JDSU ) both looked like they might turn into complete losses for investors, as Sirius looked bankruptcy-bound and JDS saw its free cash flow evaporate. Yet those who not only held on but also added new money to pick up shares on the cheap benefited the most from the huge rebounds that followed. Even less aggressive investors who simply bought index funds reaped the rewards of buying stock at the lows.
2. Stick with a solid core.
You don't have to be a daredevil to be a winning stock investor. Even though the bankruptcy-defying exploits of Ford Motor (NYSE: F ) have turned the carmaker's stock into a stellar performer since early 2009, lower-risk stocks didn't fall so far in the first place.
For instance, it's been a very long time since anyone could say that Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT ) or McDonald's (NYSE: MCD ) were high-growth powerhouse stocks. In their maturity, some would say that their best days are behind them, and they're unlikely to post the triple-digit gains that smaller stocks often sport.
Yet those two stocks were among the few to hold their ground in 2008. And even though they didn't rise as far as the big rebounders did in 2009, their aggregate return over those two years would make many investors jealous. Having a core of solid stocks like these won't always protect you from losses, but they will make the market's big bumps a little less scary.
3. Add some spice to your life.
Another thing that a solid core does is give you latitude to take some risk with a portion of your portfolio. One idea is to take 10% or so of your money and use it for risky individual stock ideas that you wouldn't want to make a bigger bet on.
What those ideas are depends a lot on your own inclination and expertise. Those who believe that the recent rise in precious metals is just the tip of the coming iceberg might put money into silver-streamer Silver Wheaton (NYSE: SLW ) , which has acted as a leveraged play on the price of the white metal. Those who instead prefer the binary results of biotech stocks could look at Orexigen Therapeutics (Nasdaq: OREX ) , whose Contrave obesity drug goes before the FDA in December.
Stay smart
No matter what you choose to invest in, having a long-term strategy is essential to avoid costly trading mistakes. Having the discipline to keep investing even during rocky periods can mean the difference between making money and treading water.

Which legislation governs elementary and secondary education?
In Canada, education is a provincial responsibility. Elementary and secondary education in Ontario is governed by the Education Act and any amendments made to that Act. Ontario Statutes and Regulations are now available online..
Back to Top
What are the roles of the ministers, school boards, and teachers? And what about parents and students?
See Who's Responsible for Your Child's Education? for a description of the responsibilities of the various participants in Ontario's elementary and secondary school system.
Can a student from outside Canada attend school in Ontario?
Yes, but in order to study here, an international student requires a valid student visa. Contact the Canadian embassy, consulate, or high commission in your country to apply for one. You will also need a letter from the school in Ontario, stating that a space is available. To find out which schools have openings for foreign students, you should contact district school boards and school authorities (for publicly funded schools) or the School Authorities (for publicly funded schools) or the private schools that interest you.
Who determines the school curriculum?.
As an adult, how can I complete the requirements for the Ontario Secondary School Diploma (OSSD)?
There are several ways to complete your secondary school diploma. For example, secondary school courses leading to diploma credits are offered by correspondence through the Ministry of Education's Independent Learning Centre. More information on this program is provided in the ILC Course Guide. If you would prefer to take courses in a classroom with other adults, contact your local school board to discuss adult credit programs. Evening classes, as well as English as a Second Language courses for those who would like to improve their English skills, are also available through most Ontario school boards.
Can I take my General Educational Development (GED) test in Ontario?
The General Educational Development test is an international secondary school equivalency examination program for adults. The GED tests cover what secondary school graduates are expected to know in mathematics, writing, science, literature, and the arts. Candidates who successfully complete the tests can earn the Ontario High School Equivalency Certificate. The GED tests are offered in English and French, and testing sites are located in Toronto, Mississauga, Sudbury, Ottawa, Thunder Bay, and Windsor. For detailed information, visit the General Educational Development page of the Independent Learning Centre.
How do I get an official transcript from the secondary school I attended?
If you left a publicly funded school within the past five years, you will most likely be able to obtain your secondary school transcript (the Ontario Student Transcript) from the last school you attended. However, some school boards maintain records in a central office, so you may be referred to the board to obtain your transcript. If you left a publicly funded school more than five years ago, or if the school you attended is no longer in operation, you should contact the school board, rather than the school.
Contact information for publicly funded schools can be found through the School Information Finder. Refer to the School Board Finder to find the contact information of your local school board or school authority. If you are looking for the contact information of a private school refer to the directory.
If a private secondary school you attended is no longer in operation, you should contact:
Ontario Ministry of Education
Education Research and Evaluation Strategy Branch
900 Bay Street
Toronto, Ontario M7A 1L2
student.records@ontario.ca
How do I get an evaluation of elementary or secondary education documents from outside Ontario?
In Ontario, individual elementary and secondary schools evaluate the academic records of all new students. If you or your children are new to Ontario, please take your education documents (translated into English or French) directly to the school you or your children will be attending. The records will be used by the school to determine grade-level placement and the number of graduation credits still required..

910-575-3100MINNEAPOLIS -- On Sunday, Nick Markakis has to make a hard decision. Should he use a pink bat manufactured by Louisville Slugger? Or should he use his own bats?
For Mother’s Day, players use pink bats and wear pink shoes. They’ll be auctioned off to benefit cancer research.
Markakis’ mother is a breast cancer survivor, and he wanted to use a bat with a pink logo, but it’s not sanctioned by Major League Baseball. Originally, MLB banned use of all pink bats on Mother’s Day which weren’t manufactured by Louisville Slugger, but relented and said players could use pink bats as long as they didn’t have a logo and they made a small contribution to the Susan G. Komen Fund for the Cure.
The Orioles’ rightfielder’s bats have logos for MaxBats, and he has said he’s not happy about it, but won’t use bats other than his own.
On Friday, there was a flurry of tweets about the controversy because Markakis and the Minnesota Twins third baseman Trevor Plouffe both wanted to use their own pink bats to honor their mothers. MLB issued the statement allowing non-Louisville Slugger pink bats.
For next month’s Father’s Day, blue wristbands are used to symbolize the fight against prostate cancer.2011 NFL Draft

WATKINS GLEN, N.Y. – Landon Cassill is ready to go road racing again.
As Cassill and the JD Motorsports with Gary Keller team prepare for Saturday’s Nationwide Series race at the Watkins Glen International road course, he looks back on a fine performance earlier this year on the road course at Road America.
Cassill finished eighth in that race, matching his best performance of the season.
“Not everybody likes road courses, but they work for me,” Cassill said. “We ran really well at Road America in June, and there’s no reason we can’t have a nice finish this weekend at the Glen. We’re taking a good car up there.”
The Zippo 200 at The Glen is the first of two straight road-course races for the series. Next on the list is Mid-Ohio.
Nationwide practice is scheduled at the Glen Friday at 9:30 a.m. and 2:10 p.m. Qualifying runs will begin at 9:40 a.m. Saturday, with the race to follow at 2:15 p.m.Drying Vegetables
by P. Kendall, P. DiPersio and J. Sofos* (11/12)
Quick Facts...
- Successful drying depends on heat, air dryness and air circulation.
- Select vegetables to be dried at peak flavor and quality.
- Blanch vegetables before drying to stop enzyme action and enhance destruction of microorganisms.
- Package dried foods in tightly sealed containers and store in a cool, dry place.
Drying is one of the oldest methods of food preservation. Drying preserves foods by removing enough moisture from food to prevent decay and spoilage. Water content of properly dried food varies from 5 to 25 percent depending on the food. Successful drying depends on:
- enough heat to draw out moisture, without cooking the food;
- dry air to absorb the released moisture; and
- adequate air circulation to carry off the moisture.
When drying foods, the key is to remove moisture as quickly as possible at a temperature that does not seriously affect the flavor, texture and color of the food. If the temperature is too low in the beginning, microorganisms may survive and even grow before the food is adequately dried. If the temperature is too high and the humidity too low, the food may harden on the surface. This makes it more difficult for moisture to escape and the food does not dry properly.
Although drying is a relatively simple method of food preservation, the procedure is not exact. A “trial and error” approach often is needed to decide which techniques work best.
Nutritional Value of Dried Foods
Drying, like all methods of preservation, can result in loss of some nutrients. Nutritional.
For best retention of nutrients in dried foods, store in a cool, dark, dry place and use within a heat resistant.
Selecting Vegetables
Select vegetables at peak flavor and eating quality. This usually is just as they reach maturity. Sweet corn and green peas, however, should be slightly immature so they retain their sweet flavor before their sugars change to starch. Refer to Table 1 for fresh-to-dried ratios for a variety of produce.
Picking activates enzymes that cause color, flavor, texture, sugar content and nutrient changes in vegetables. To control such changes, prepare the produce immediately after gathering and begin processing at once. Thoroughly wash or clean produce to remove any dirt or spray. Drain thoroughly. Shake leafy vegetables well. Sort and discard any food with decay, bruises or mold. Such defects may affect all pieces being dried.
Pretreating Vegetables to Enhance Quality and Safety
Pretreating vegetables by blanching in boiling water or citric acid solution is recommended to enhance the quality and safety of the dried vegetables (see Table 2). Blanching helps slow or stop the enzyme activity that can cause undesirable changes in flavor and texture during storage. Blanching also relaxes tissues so pieces dry faster, helps protect the vitamins and color and reduces the time needed to refresh vegetables before cooking. In addition, research studies have shown that pretreating vegetables by blanching in water or citric acid solution enhances the destruction of potentially harmful bacteria during drying, including Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella species and Listeria monocytogenes.
Blanching
Water blanching is recommended over steam blanching or blanching in a microwave because water blanching achieves a more even heat penetration than the other two methods. Plain water or water with added citric acid may be used. Citric acid acts as an anti-darkening and anti-microbial agent. Prepare the citric acid water by stirring 1/4 teaspoon (1 gram) of citric acid into one quart (approximately one liter) of water.
Work with small amounts so plain or citric acid water doesn’t stop boiling. Watch closely and precook as follows:
- Fill large kettle half full with plain or citric acid water and bring to a boil.
- Put no more than one quart of the vegetable pieces in a cheesecloth or other mesh bag. A 36-inch cloth square gathered at the corners works well. Secure ends.
- Drop vegetable bag in boiling water, making sure water covers the vegetables. Shake bag so hot water reaches all pieces.
- Start timing as soon as vegetables are in boiling water. Adjust heat to ensure continuous boiling.
- Heat for length of time shown in Table 2.
- Drop bag in very cold water to cool (same time as blanched).
- Drain on paper towel or cloth.
Drying Methods
Arrange pretreated vegetables on drying trays in single or thin layers, 1/2 inch deep or less. Dry in dehydrator or oven as described below.
Dehydrator Drying.
Electric dehydrators with thermostatic controls are recommended for home food drying. They are relatively inexpensive, convenient for drying large or small batches of food, and easy to use. The best dehydrators have thermostatically controlled heat settings and fans that blow warm air over the foods. Some models have a heat source at the bottom and removable, perforated trays (for air circulation) stacked above the heat source. Dehydrators should be used indoors in a dry, well-ventilated room. Food on lower trays near the heat source will often dry more rapidly than food on higher trays and, therefore, trays should be rotated throughout drying.
Oven Drying.
If you do not have access to a food dehydrator, either a gas or electric oven may be used to dry vegetables. Both require careful watching to prevent scorching. Proper temperature and ventilation are most important in oven drying. To oven dry, preheat oven at lowest setting (140 to 150 degrees F), then adjust the thermostat and prop the oven door open to achieve a consistent oven temperature of 140 degrees F, and to allow moist air to escape.
Conventional ovens may not maintain consistent temperatures at low settings. To ensure maintenance of 140 to 150 degrees F, monitor oven temperature using a calibrated oven thermometer. Place the oven thermometer directly on the oven rack or tray and check it every two hours throughout drying.
Place trays of prepared food in oven. Stack trays so there is at least 3 inches of clearance at the top and bottom of the oven and 2 1/2 inches between trays. Shift trays, top to bottom and front to back, every half hour. Stir food often if it is 1/2-inch deep or more. Single layers need no stirring. Food scorches easily toward the end of drying time; therefore, turn the heat off when drying is almost complete and open the door wide for an additional hour or so.
Post-Drying Treatment.
When drying is complete, some pieces will be moister than others due to size and location during drying. Conditioning distributes residual moisture evenly in dried food so there is less chance of spoilage. To condition, place the cooled, dried vegetables in large plastic or glass containers to about two-thirds full. Cover lightly and store in a warm, dry, well-ventilated place for four to 10 days. Stir or shake containers daily to separate pieces. If beads of moisture form inside, return the food to the dehydrator for further drying, then repeat the conditioning step. Because vegetables dry to a nearly waterless state, conditioning them is not always necessary.
Packaging and Storing
Pack cooled, dried foods in small amounts in dry, scalded glass jars (preferable dark) or in moisture- and vapor-proof freezer containers, boxes or bags. Metal cans may be used if food is first placed in a freezer bag.
To protect from insects and reabsorption. Store in a cool, dry, dark place. Properly stored, dried vegetables keep well for six to 12 months. Discard all foods that develop off smells or flavors or show signs of mold.
Using Dried Vegetables
One cup of dried vegetables reconstitutes to about 2 cups. To rehydrate and cook leafy or tender vegetables (spinach, kale, cabbage, chard, tomatoes), cover with hot water and simmer to desired tenderness..

The Left - (Liberalism/ Socialism/ Political Correctness) has, of course, triumphed in the West - colonizing the elite intellectuals of government, public administration, law, the churches, education and so on.
But what is the essence of its triumph - what precisely has the Left actually conquered?
The answer is simple and single. The answer is the mass media.
The core triumph is the mass media - but a further element was necessary: the expansion of the mass media to fill the attention of most of the people, most of the time.
So, now, the mass media is reality.
(Reality itself has become merely a matter of opinion: individual anecdote. Worthless, indeed wicked, unless validated by the media.)
So that is the triumph of the West - to conquer the mass media in a situation where the mass media dominates the minds of the mass of people.

The wedding, held at the Ojai Valley Spa and Inn, was attended by famous guests including Jennifer Aniston and her fiancé Justin Theroux, Ben Affleck and wife Jennifer Garner and Matt Damon and his wife Luciana.
New mum Kristen Bell and Dax Shepard, who welcomed their first child in March, comedienne Ellen DeGeneres and wife Portia De Rossi, and Emily Blunt and husband John Krasinski were also in attendance.

Jimmy, 45, was dapper in a tuxedo while his 35-year-old bride looked stunning in a white lace wedding gown with sweetheart neckline.
Molly was watched by around 300 guests as she walked down the aisle alongside her father.
At the end of the ceremony, the newlyweds, who began dating in 2009, exited to George Harrison's My Sweet Lord.
"They are a really great couple," a source told Us Weekly. "Everyone is very happy for them."
The couple got engaged last year when the TV show host proposed to the Jimmy Kimmel Live's co-head writer while the two were on holiday in South Africa.
Guests gathered the night before the wedding for the rehearsal dinner, according to Us Weekly, where "guests were taken via trolley to a big barn near the inn, where the bride and groom – both dressed in all white – waited to greet them."
Invitations to the romantic ceremony – which took place in the idyllic setting of 220 acres of steeped mountains just 90 minutes away from Las Angeles – requested that guests make a charitable donation instead of wedding gifts for the newlywed couple.

World-Class Cycling Returns to Prince Edward Island with Tour de PEIPress releasePrince Edward Island's seaside villages and idyllic countryside will be transformed into Canada's most exciting new cycling destination with the return of Tour de PEI from June 8-12.The inaugural race was named Road Event Organizer of the Year by the Canadian Cycling Association in 2007. The event is now attracting a growing amount of interest from athletes around the world.One hundred female cyclists are expected to participate in the five-day, five-stage race. The new route highlights the Island's scenic countryside and coastline for thousands of spectators and 600,000 television viewers who are expected to tune into a feature presentation of the race. Media coverage reached one million households during last year's event."Tour de PEI is a perfect fit for Prince Edward Island because it showcases before the world everything the province has to offer," said the Honourable Valerie Docherty, Minister of Tourism and Honourary President of Tour de PEI. "This event is more than a bike race as it presents Prince Edward Island to the world."The participating athletes will cross scenic but challenging terrain covering a total of 403 kilometres, including a 120 kilometre-long race across the hilliest regions in central PEI.A highlight of the race will take place on Monday, June 9, when cyclists will race in a time trial across the 12.9-kilometre-long Confederation Bridge. The bridge will be closed between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. on that day."The Government of Canada continues to work with its partners to build a strong and sustainable tourism industry here in Atlantic Canada," said the Honourable Peter MacKay, Minister of National Defence and Minister of the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency (ACOA).

Despite the multitude of amazing local restaurants in the city, which I adore, my friends and I have been known to make a yearly trip to the Times Square Olive Garden for unlimited pasta season, or to get really excited to eat Panera on a road trip. What, you guys? Did you not read the part about unlimited pasta??
"Seriously, this is your favorite restaurant you just had to take me to?",
But a chain restaurant on a date? Years ago, a reader complained that guys always seemed to suggest that, and it bummed her out. Although we told her to go easy on the guys, most of us agreed that a chain restaurant is kind of the worst for a date. I agree, but to try to defend my secret shame, and also, to stand up for the folks that live in an area where chains are the main option, I decided to awaken my inner lawyer and argue both sides of the case. There have to be some legitimate reasons to go, right? Let's see....
Pro: Familiarity. In case you’re hesitant to try a new place—ugh, what if you can’t even pronounce any of the fancy French wines? — you can rest assured that you know exactly what you’ll get at every pretty much every Applebee's or Red Lobster across the country. A comfort date, of sorts.
Con: A little too comfortable, maybe. People in sweatpants, a basketball game flashing on five TVs at the bar, and perky waitstaff with 32 different slogan buttons don’t set exactly the mood you might be going for.
Pro: Lots of food for relatively reasonable prices. You can go all out, with a plate of nachos to start and a shared brownie sundae for dessert, without going completely bankrupt. Nom.
Con: All-you-can-eat-breadstick belly (and garlic breath). Um, sexy?
Pro: Casual atmosphere, no reservation needed.
Con: Too-bright lighting, getting interrupted by 14 rounds of the restaurant’s special “Happy Birthday” song to all the people celebrating birthdays there.
Pro: The cocktails, like the entrees, tend to be oversized at chain restaurants. One giant Long Island Iced Tea for liquid courage, please!
Con: Barfing up sour mix isn't going to get you a goodnight kiss.
Pro: Chain restaurants might be so out they're in. Everybody else won't shut up about that new vegan, organic, gluten-free place with the chalkboard menus and home-brewed mead. Which makes you the real original, going to T.G.I.Friday's. You're so retro.
Con: Wait, is this just the date equivalent of “ironically” wearing a T-shirt and drinking PBR? Ugh, never mind.
OK, OK, I admit it. I tried my hardest to make their case, but I still think chain restaurants are a pretty bad idea for a date. I'll never give up my secret love of a fried appetizer sampler plate, but I'm still suggesting the romantic hole in the wall for my next dinner for two.
Are you vehemently anti-chain restaurant, or do you like them? Does your opinion change for dates? Do you find guys often suggest chain restaurants for dates with you?

There are many different types of Dementia, however Alzheimer’s is the most common form. It affects more than half a million people in the UK alone. Alzheimer’s is a progressive condition, with time leaving people affected by it needing support. At Helping Hands’, we believe there are many benefits to allowing someone with Alzheimer’s to remain in their own home. That’s why we offer person-centred Alzheimer’s care at home.
Our trained Alzheimer’s carers move into the homes of their customers to provide medical support and personal care that’s specially tailored to the needs of the individual.
Alzheimer’s Care at Home
People affected by Alzheimer’s experience a range of symptoms. These symptoms include a decline in memory, disorientation and confusion surrounding places and times, difficulty in completing tasks and changes in behaviour. Therefore, an Alzheimer’s care plan tailored to the individual is a necessity. We work with individuals, their families, their GPs and professionals from other healthcare organisations to deliver a package of Alzheimer’s support that meets the needs of the person.
Through our Alzheimer’s care, we provide support tailored to help people with many of the typical symptoms experienced by someone with the condition. These include:
Decline in Memory: Our Alzheimer’s support workers work with their customers to create memory boxes and scrapbooks, featuring photographs and other sentimental tokens to help stimulate memories. You and your loved one can also rest assured that they’re always around to reassure, prompt and assist – for example, reminding them to feed the dog, put the washing machine on or take their medication.
Confusion with Time and Place: People affected by Alzheimer’s often find themselves unsure about time, place, where they should be or what they need to do. We can provide help with calendar management, assist them get to where they need to go and reassure any fears they might be feeling.
Help around the Home: Although our Alzheimer’s support services are primarily focussed around the medical needs of our customers, our carers are also on hand to provide help round the home. They can help people with basic tasks they might struggle with – from making a sandwich or vacuuming to filling out prescriptions or putting the dustbin out. However, they never look to exclude the people they care for from getting involved in these tasks.
Social Interaction: A Helping Hands’ Alzheimer’s carer is warm, friendly and full of enthusiasm. They want to make a positive difference to the lives of their customers. As well as always being around for a chat over a cup of tea, our carers will also provide support with social activities when caring for someone with Alzheimer’s through gentle encouragement.
Changes in Behaviour: With time, the condition impacts the functions carried out by the brain resulting in behavioural changes. Our one-to-one Alzheimer’s support enables both carer and customer to develop a relationship, meaning there’s never any display of shock or anger at sudden changes in behaviour. Trained and experienced, they understand and will provide the level of assistance required.
The importance of Alzheimer’s support in the Home
Consistency is a massive part of any type of care, but especially when caring for someone with Alzheimer’s. Moving an individual affected by this illness into an environment they’re unfamiliar with, such as a residential care home, can have a negative impact. It can cause distress, confusion and discomfort.
With Alzheimer’s home care, an individual can get the medical support they need in the place they know and love best – their own home. Homes aren’t just buildings – they hold lots memories, items with lots of sentimental value and photographs. They can also be around the ones they love more frequently. And all of this can help to stimulate the memory.
When they deliver care for Alzheimer’s patients, our carers always look to maintain existing routines and lifestyles, so you or your loved one never have to worry about adapting to major change.
Our Alzheimer’s Support Workers
Before going into the homes of their customers, our Alzheimer’s support workers go through intensive training at our Centre of Excellence, based in Alcester. Here, they learn about the complexities of the illness and its symptoms. This process gives them the preparation they need to deal with the challenges they’ll face when caring for someone with Alzheimer’s on a daily basis.
We ensure that consistency is at the core of our Alzheimer’s care plans. Our Alzheimer’s carers usually work in blocks of six to eight weeks before taking a respite break. This allows them to build up a strong bond with the person they’re caring for. We’ll then provide a temporary carer to go into the home to take over for a short period of time, enabling the person receiving care to develop relationships with others.
If yours or your loved one’s carer happens to fall ill or have a family emergency, we’ll always ensure that a replacement carer is there and ready to deliver support – at short notice.
Find out More About Alzheimer’s Help from Helping Hands
Making a decision on whether or not to take on Alzheimer’s care for you or a loved one is one of the toughest decisions you’re likely to face in life. But you’re never alone. Our team of Alzheimer’s support advisors are there to talk you through the steps involved in our care services. They’re more than happy to answer any questions or queries you might have too.1 item from 2015

Indian desserts are very appealing and tempting. They come from different regions, many of which were developed for festivals. No matter what time of day it is, there is always room for these mouthwatering Indian Sweets (Indian Mithai).
A delicious meal is incomplete without sweet dishes such as gulab jamun, kulfi, gajjar or suji ka halwa. These all time favorites are also used during pooja and festivals. Indian sweets and desserts are garnished with raisins, almond and pistachio, all normally served after a meal.

David Singer’s foray into the used furniture business was supposed to be temporary. After graduating college in 2004, Singer was looking to make extra cash for law school and decided to sell off the remaining merchandise from his grandfather’s furniture company, which had shuttered three years earlier. By the end of the summer, he decided to forgo a legal career and to restart Warehouse of Fixtures TNG (The New Generation).
Singer’s learning curve was steep, and included figuring out the difference between margin and markup. Six months in, he made his first major decision, spending $14,500 to buy furniture from 321 Studios, a company that sold DVD burning software. “I had to decide if I wanted to stay in business or not,” said Singer, who borrowed money from his father and never looked back.
Today, Warehouse of Fixtures has $4 million in revenue and sells $1 million of used furniture and $3 million of new or refurbished furniture a year. Its headquarters, at 2720 Market St., spans 170,000 square feet, including a 28,000-square-foot showroom. Singer said selling refurbished furniture has been a growing category for the business.
“I’ve never seen anybody (who’s) been able to buy so much furniture from companies for nothing, as only he can,” said Doug Schukar, president and CEO of USA Mortgage and a customer for the past 10 years. “He’s probably the toughest negotiator on the buy side I’ve ever come across.”

Benefit Corporations
A dozen companies committed to maximizing social good while turning a profit have filed papers with the state to become California's first "benefit corporations." It was the first business day they could register under a recently approved state law that gives companies a way to legally structure their businesses to consider social and environmental efforts as part of their missions.The Rise of Benefit Corporations. Entrepreneurs who wanted to incorporate green initiatives or social causes into their businesses were often forced to become nonprofits, limiting their ability to raise venture capital.
California's new category allows corporations to officially adopt policies "that create a material positive impact on society and the environment" as an integral part their legal charter. The Huffman legislation also expands the fiduciary duty of executives and board members to include the interests of workers and the community.
When America began, the states chartered corporations for public purposes, like building bridges. They could earn profits, but their legitimacy flowed from their delegated mission.
Today, corporations are chartered without any public purposes at all. They are legally bound to pursue a single private purpose: profit maximization. Thus, far from advancing the common good, many for-profit corporations have come to defy the law, corrupt the officials charged with enforcing it and inflict harm on the public with impunity.. [...]
This is an important shift in law. The fear of shareholder litigation has driven many public-spirited businesses, most famously Ben & Jerry's, to take the high bid rather than the high road in a corporate takeover fight. Becoming a Benefit Corporation declares legal independence from the profits-ber-alles model. [...].

More particularly, the present invention relates to a personal computer operating in a communication network where the workstation includes an operating system and an executable application and/or operating system and the workstation can recover from a crash resulting from corruption of the application and/or operating system by the operating system without using the communications network to download another copy of the executable application and operating system.
One application of a personal computer is as a workstation where an executable application is loaded into the workstation, operating on top of an operating system like Microsoft's Windows. The operator uses the combination of the executable application and the operating system to enter data, such as orders, in response to customer requests, for example, by telephone calls received at a call center. Once the data is entered and verified, the data is typically forwarded from the workstation computer over a communications network to a host computer or server for storage and further processing (e.g., for order fulfillment, billing, service, etc.) driven by the host computer. Typically, a large number of workstations are coupled to a single host or server.
The executable application (and operating system, if desired) in the personal computer may be initially obtained from the server (in a download operation) or copied from transportable media (like a CD ROM or other storage devices such as floppy diskettes). The executable application (and operating system) randomly and, often without warning, at times become corrupted (and “crash”) due to the numerous temporary files which are cached or written during “normal” operation of the executable application and operating system. In such cases, then, the personal computer or client must be turned off, rebooted and another copy of the application program obtained.
Obtaining another copy of the application program (and/or the operating system) from the server after the application or the operating system has become corrupted and crashed takes communication resources, bandwidth which otherwise might be used to communicate data from the other workstations also attached to the server through the network. Frequently, a large number of workstations are all connected to the same server through the communications network and, in the order entry application described above, the primary purpose of the communication network would be for communicating order entry data from each of the workstations up to the server as each order is entered. In its peak operation, the communications from the workstations might take most, if not all, of the capacity of the communication channel, so it would be desirable to avoid extra communications that would be involved in downloading another copy of the executable application (and operating system) if a workstation crashed from a corrupted executable application or operating system.
Alternatively, each workstation might be brought back up (or restarted and reloaded with an uncorrupted copy of the executable application and operating system) after a crash from a separate physical media available at each individual workstation. Two undesirable features relate to having media at each workstation: the cost of distributing and locating the physical media with the executable application and operating system at each of the plurality of workstations and the security of the media from some user removing the media with the executable applications, either inadvertently or as a theft.
Accordingly, the prior art systems for using an executable application and operating system at a workstation in a client-server environment have significant disadvantages and limitations.
The present invention overcomes the disadvantages and limitations of the prior art systems by providing a personal computer system and method for recovering from a corrupted executable application and/or operating system (and a resulting crash) without having to download a new copy of the executable application and operating system using some of the limited communication channel capacity in the process.
The present system also has the advantage that a media copy of the executable application program and operating system need not be provided for each workstation so that the workstation client can be rebooted and resume operation after a crash without the necessity of a local media copy of the application and operating system.
The present system and method are characterized by a plurality of partitioned storage areas (preferably regions on the hard drive) on the personal computer, with each including a copy of the executable application and operating system copied at the time of initial loading of the application, sometimes called the “image”, whether from media or from the network. One of the copies of the executable application and operating system then becomes a “working” copy of the application (which the user employs in processing his data such as the order entry application discussed above) and a second copy becomes a “back-up” (or archive) copy (which is not used normally, but becomes visible and used only after the working copy becomes corrupted and crashes). Then, when the back-up or archive copy becomes visible and becomes used as the working copy, a further copy of the executable application is prepared to serve as a new back-up copy, so that a back-up copy remains available even after the first copy is corrupted and the archive or back-up copy is used as the working copy. Since the back-up or archive copy may be in a partition which is hidden, the operating system does not “see” that part of the storage and does not use that part of the storage for writing temporary files which may cause the back-up or archive copy to be corrupted.
The system of the present invention also has the advantageous feature that it is self-renewing. That is, after the system crashes and before the back-up copy of the application is taken as the working copy, the system and method of the present invention envision that a new archive copy would be made, before the copy that was the back-up copy has a chance to become corrupted.
Another advantage of the present invention is that a stored backup copy can be updated periodically, if desired, and that updating may occur either from the server (in case the executable application needs to be updated for revisions to the executable application) or from the working copy (in case, for example, that data is stored locally and it is desired to have a backup of the stored data). In the case that the updating is from the server downloading a copy of the image, Such updating may be scheduled so as to occur when the data traffic on the communications channel is at a low level, for example, in the middle of the night, or may be available for those times when the traffic is at a reduced level. Thus, for example, a copy of the executable application could be downloaded once a week at 4:00 a.m. on Sunday morning. Alternatively, the system could be programmed to back itself up every evening or once a week, as desired, and then, if the system crashes, the content of the backup copy is no more out-of-date than the time since the last backup. In some applications, it may be desirable to retain backup copies of different period, so you might backup the application with one copy from this past weekend and a second copy from the previous weekend, and then when each backup occurs, to keep the most recent two versions.
Accordingly, the present invention overcomes the disadvantages and limitations of the prior art by providing a workstation system which allows recovery of an executable application and/or operating system after the executable application and/or operating system has been corrupted. This recovery is effected without having to download a replacement copy and without requiring a copy of the application and the operating system in removable media at the workstation.
FIG. 1 is a view of a computer network of the type which is useful for using the present invention.
FIG. 2 is a logical flow chart showing the operation of the present invention allow a workstation to recover from system crashes.
FIG. 3 is a schematic view of the memory of a personal computer in the computer network of FIG. 1, using the present invention.
FIG. 1 shows a workstation or personal computer 10 operating as a client computer in a client/server data processing environment. The personal computer 10 is shown with a monitor 11, a keyboard 12, a mouse 14, a floppy drive 27 and a power switch 21. The personal computer 10 also includes within the case a hard drive or storage device (not shown) for storing executable applications (programs), operating system and/or data. This hard drive is of conventional design and is commercially available from any one of a variety of manufacturers and usually would include the capability to partition the storage into a plurality of segments in a conventional and well-known manner. Many hard drives also have indicators to indicate which partitions or areas of the storage are “active” or available for use, and which are “hidden” or not currently available for use.
The personal computer 10 is connected to a host computer or server computer 38 through a communication channel 36. The communications channel would also connect the host computer or server 38 to a plurality of other client computers, shown here by blocks 40, 41, 42. The number of client computers depends on the application and the data processing involved, but could include a large number of clients operatively connected to the host computer 38 through the communications channel 36. The communications channel 36 used in the present invention could be either a local-area-network (LAN), a wide-area-network (WAN) or a radio frequency (RF) communications system of any of a variety of known and conventional designs. In any case, the communications channel may be the limiting factor in how much data is communicated from the client computers to the host and, if the communications channel were also used to bring back up client computers after the images have been corrupted, that additional communications channel traffic could limit the amount of data being sent from the client computers to the host computer.
FIG. 2 illustrates the logical flow of the present invention in flowchart form. The first step in this process is that the storage (the hard drive discussed with respect to FIG. 1, in its preferred embodiment) is partitioned to be divided into a plurality of different segments at block 51. The executable application (and operating system, if desired) is then obtained at block 52, either by downloading the application from the host or loading it from removable media.
At block 53, a first copy (also referred to as a “working” copy) of the executable application (and, optionally, the operating system) is stored in a first partition and at block 54 a second copy (sometimes referred to as an archive or backup copy) of the executable application and the operating system is stored into a second partition of the storage. At block 55 is a test as to whether the working copy of the application and operating system is corrupted: this test is simple, since current versions of the operating system typically simply “hang” or “crash” and require that the user turn the entire workstation off, then restart the machine, but designs could easily evolve to allow the application and/or operating system to test themselves as to whether either is “corrupted” or not. In any event, if the working copy is not corrupted, then the working copy of the executable application (and operating system) is used, see block 56, for the data processing (i.e. the application might be order entry or word processing or other application, as desired). In block 57, the system tests whether it is time to update the backup copy, a updating which may occur after a predetermined amount of time has passed or after a predetermined amount of data has been accumulated, or because it is a predetermined time (like 4:00 a.m. on Sunday morning when the system usage might be expected to be low, allowing the use of the communications channel for updating). If the backup copy of the application is to be updated, it is updated at block 58, then returns to block 55 to resume the cycle.
If the working copy of the executable application (and operating system) has been determined to be corrupted at the block 55, then at block 59 the backup copy is copied (a third copy), the backup copy becomes the working copy and the third copy becomes the backup copy at block 60, and the data processing resumes at the block 55.
FIG. 3 illustrates the organization of the workstation storage 100 (the hard drive of the personal computer) as used in practicing the present invention. The storage 100 is partitioned or divided into segments or partitions in a conventional manner, and shown here with four segments or partitions, 101, 102, 103 and 104. When the personal computer is turned on, or boots up, the program always goes to “image 0” segment which is reference number 101. Stored within this image 0 segment is an address of the “working” copy of the application (and operating system, if desired), in this case “address 1”, in location 101 a. As the executable application is loaded, a copy is put into segment 102 and segment 103 as image 1 and image 2, respectively, located at address 1 and address 2, respectively. Each of the segments 101, 102, 103 also includes an indicator 102 b, 103 b, 104 b, respectively, designating whether the segment is active and visible (by the code OE) or whether the segment is inactive and hidden (indicator “FF”).
The current workstation operating systems infrequently, but at randomly and unpredictable occasions, cause the working files on the active segments to become corrupted, causing the system to “crash”. Today's applications and operating systems then cease to operate and abort with some kind of message to the user that the system has failed. Once the system crashes, then it is necessary for the operator to turn the workstation off and restart the workstation. When the image 0 is executed, it can prompt the user either to indicate that a crash has occurred or that the backup system is to be used, a function which may require a supervisory password. Once this has been indicated, then the address of the working copy of the executable application (in location 101 a) is changed from “address1” to “address2” and the indicator of active or inactive segments is changed, with the indicator 102 b for image1 in segment 102 changing from OE (indicating active) to FF (indicating hidden) and with the indicator 103 b for image2 in segment 103 b changing from FF (indicating hidden or inactive) to 0E (indicating active). Before processing occurs, however, a copy of the backup copy of the executable application (and operating system, if desired) (image2 in segment 103) is copied as image3 in segment 104 to provide a new backup copy of the executable application (and operating system, if desired), now that the backup copy is to be used as the working copy. The process can continue with new backup copies being made each time that the working copy crashes and the backup copy is to be used as the working copy.
The image from which to boot the workstation after a crash could be indicated by the operator, as described above, with or without a supervisory password. Alternatively, it may be that the host computer (through the network connection) will indicate the copy of the application to use on boot up, based upon the network knowing which copy of the workstation's program has been used and whether the system “crashed” and needs to be started from a different copy of the application and the operating system.
It may be desirable to periodically backup the executable application (and operating system) on the workstation by copying it to replace the existing backup copy, particularly if the working copy changes in response to user input. In some applications, the workstation retains information as it is entered and stores it in the local workstation storage rather than immediately forwarding it to the host computer or server; in these cases, it would be desirable to have a backup copy of that changing data in case the working copy crashes. In other cases, the workstation is used primarily as a data entry device and input data, once entered and verified, is directly moved to the host computer where, as a more substantial processor and a better operating system, presumably, it is subject to better systems for backup and recovery in case of failure.
Some systems are subject to periodic maintenance and updating, either after so many transactions or some much processing or at a fixed time each week. In those cases, then, the executable application (and operating system, if desired) and the backup copy may be refreshed through normal maintenance.
Of course, many modifications can be made to the preferred embodiment without departing from the spirit of the present invention. Those skilled in the art will recognize many changes and adaptations to the present invention based on their knowledge of the capabilities of data processing systems and alternatives, taken together with the foregoing teachings, the appended claims and the accompanying drawings. It is also possible to use some features of the present invention without the corresponding use of other features that were disclosed. For example, a periodic updating of the backup image may be scheduled, either by download from the host computer (preferably at a time when the communication channel is less active with other communications) or from copying the working copy of the application (and operating system, if desired), if the working copy of the application includes data which is updated and stored at the workstation. Accordingly the foregoing description of the preferred embodiment should be considered as merely illustrative of the principles of the present invention and not in limitation thereof, since the present invention is defined solely by the claims which follow.[Full-disclosure] bigwebmaster guestbook multiply XSS

There is a big difference between being approached by someone about buying your business and actually selling it.
Consider the Riverside Company's acquisition activity in 2009. Riverside is a large, successful private equity outfit that specializes in buying companies, streamlining their operations, jamming them together with other complementary companies and selling them for a profit.
In its 2009 annual report, Riverside claims it considered buying 4,228 companies during the year. Of those, it walked away from 2,913 and sent a screening memo to the other 1,315.
Of course, when you get a letter from a big, international private equity company saying it's interested in buying your business, you might be tempted to break out the bubbly and head down to the Ferrari dealership. But don't be too hasty. Of the 1,315 companies that got a letter, 968 were eliminated before Riverside even set foot in their office or plant. In fact, Riverside went only so far as to visit 347 companies.
Of the 347 companies it met with, Riverside provided just 63 with a formal letter of intent (LOI) to buy their business; the other 284 were left asking what they said wrong in the meeting.
Now, surely an LOI is worth celebrating. At the LOI stage, the acquirer has spelled out the purchase price it is willing to pay, the working capital that needs to be left in the business at closing, the operating covenants, the due diligence check list and so on. Surely it wouldn't go to that level of detail if it wasn't planning to follow through on its offer to buy the business. Or would it? Well, of the 63 companies that got an LOI from Riverside last year, only 15 actually got acquired, leaving the other 48 either turning down an offer or standing at the altar.
In my experience, selling a business is a little bit like an elimination-round tennis tournament. A lot of people make it to the tournament, but as you advance from one round to the next, the challenges get tougher, and at each stage, a lot of good players get eliminated.

Herzl Year, the year of the commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the death of Theodor Herzl, founder of modern Zionism, was ushered in here last night at a ceremony in front of the Herzl Tomb.
Present at the ceremony were the President and Premier of Israel, members of the government and Parliament and a host of others including two lone survivors among the band of pioneers who organized the first Zionist Congress with Dr. Herzl in Basle in 1897. The two surviving colleagues of Dr. Herzl are Prof. Joseph Klausner and Meyer Ebner.
The short ceremony featured prayers for the dead, the reading of selected psalms and selections from Dr. Herzl’s diary and representative addresses. Afterwards, the President of Israel, Itzhak Ben Zvi, led a processional past the tomb. He was followed by members of the Cabinet, deputies of Parliament and members of the Jewish Agency and of the Zionist Actions Committee.
Platoons representing various arms of the Israel defense forces presented arms as the national and Zionist flags were hoisted over the tomb. The grave site was covered with a veritable forest of Zionist flags carried by representatives of youth organizations and youth groups played band selections and choirs sang throughout an hour-long musical program.Idamycin PFS

Innichen/San Candido podium celebrating -GEPA Pictures
INNICHEN/SAN CANDIDO, ITA – The second of back-to-back races in the Italian Dolomites and the last FIS Freestyle World Cup event of the 2013 calender year closed out a massive week for the Freestyle tour.
For the second day in a row the athletes of the Audi ski cross World Cup tour stared down the challenging Innichen/San Candido course – a track that, for what it lacks in physically imposing features, makes up for in tricky technical sections and an emphasis on cagey line selection.
The biggest story on the day was the performance of Dave Duncan (CAN), a seven year tour vet who scored the first victory of his career in the weekend's first race on Saturday, and then carried that momentum right through to Sunday's qualification, heats, and finals to stage a remarkable repeat performance and win both the weekend's races.
He didn't take an easy road to do so, either, facing down his teammate Brady Leman (who finished 3rd in Saturday's race), slick Daniel Bohnacker (GER), and the resurgent Andreas Matt (AUT), who just last week scored his first victory in nearly two years in Val Thorens (FRA).
Duncan fell behind out of the gate in the final, with lanky German Bohnacker grabbing the lead. However, a slick pass on a double-up jump in the just a few turns into the race gave him a lead he would hold on to for the rest of the race.
For a while it looked like it was going to be a Canadian 1-2, as Leman got past Bohnacker just after Duncan. Just a few turns later Leman then got caught up with Andy Matt, allowing the big Austrian to pass him. On the second-to-last jump, trying to reclaim 2nd place, Leman got off line and missed the last gate of the race. Matt held on to 2nd and Bohnacker was essentially handed 3rd.
In the ladies final it was Marielle Thompson (CAN) who seemed out for a little revenge after losing a ski and crashing in Saturday's semi-finals after looking like the favourite up until that point. She was on fire again on Sunday, this time making it through to the finals easily, and then grabbing the lead in those finals out of the start.
Stacked up against Katrin Mueller (SUI), Anna Woerner (SUI), and Heidi Zacher (GER), Thompson looked to be in control through the middle portion of the race. However, Mueller was steadily making up time behind her, biding time, before rocketing inside around Thompson on one of the race's final turns to steal the victory. Thompson held on to 2nd while Zacher was able to fend teammate Woerner for 3rd.
With their performances, Duncan and Thompson now head into the holiday break in possession of the their respective men's and ladies' red ski cross overall leader bibs.

Earlier this week, it was reported that Masina was under investigation in both California and his home state of Utah amidst allegations of sexual assault. TMZ.com has obtained a copy of the search warrant used by police in Los Angeles to search Masina’s Los Angeles apartment as well as the linebacker’s phone. A DNA sample was also obtained from Masina..
One of Masina’s Trojan teammates, fellow linebacker Don Hill, is also mentioned in the warrant, although it’s unclear if he’s the subject of a police investigation as well.
From TMZ‘s report on the first alleged rape, which the woman claims took place July 14 in Los Angeles….
… and the second alleged rape, this one July 26 in Utah:
The woman claims she passed out and awoke to see him on top of her, engaging in anal sex with her. She also says he forced oral sex.
The woman says she woke up the next morning in pain and went to police, and a rape kit was administered.
Head coach Clay Helton confirmed earlier this week that Masina had been indefinitely suspended for USC’s opener against Alabama, even as the true sophomore is, for whatever reason, still permitted to practice with the team. Helton’s explanation for that is the university, not the football program, that’s handling the player’s discipline.
According to the Los Angeles Times, the Cottonwood Heights (Utah) Police Department is investigating Masina on allegations of forcible rape, forcible sodomy, fondling and exploitation via a telecommunication device.
At this point, no charges have been filed against either Masina or Hill..- NicaraguaRetail

Internet/Mail Bids: 9I hate networking…
No, that’s not strictly true. Networking makes me feel uncomfortable and to be honest until recently I never understood why. On every instrument, test or diagnostic I have ever completed I come out as an extravert (and if you’ve met me this is unlikely to surprise you) but it wasn’t until I went on the qualifying course for the MBTI Stage 2 that all became clear. Most of you will be familiar with MBTI Stage 1 – self perception, compare with your reported scores, come up with a 4 letter personality type (mine is ENTP). What Stage 2 does is break each of the preferences down into 5 facets and this is where, for me, it got really interesting, as when it came to extraversion I scored as an extravert except the facet “initiating/receiving” where I scored as an introvert. The mists cleared, the fog lifted and all became clear – I don’t like initiating conversation/interaction with people I don’t know (or as @Thinkingfox has put it “Jonesy, you can close but you can’t open” – the context of the remark I’ll allow you to decide for yourself)
About a year ago I decided, for various reasons, that I needed to get over myself and start networking more proactively and it was through a blog (My hell is other people) and Twitter discussions about music that I started to network with an informal group called ConnectingHR. A year ago they held their first “Unconference” and yesterday was the second. I had watched the first from the Twitter sidelines but yesterday I moxied up, paid my dues and attended.
If you don’t know what an unconference is, Google it. But the fag packet answer is like a conference but with content driven by the attendees, not structured “push” but more owner operated “pull”. So at 9.30am we started and (through some great facilitation from @dougshaw1) we finished with a grid of topics for discussion. I don’t intend to try and summarise any of them here (I will post a follow up which will summarise one of the topics I was part of….but that’s for another time). If you are interested in the content search the #chru hashtag on Twitter and there are several great blogs already out there. If you can’t do that – sign up to Twitter STAT….
I was asked by several people on several different occasions what I thought of it….and my response on every occasion was the same “interesting”. Which can be, and was, taken in different ways. The caveat I added was that I needed time to reflect and digest.
I have reflected and digested and will offer another caveat – what follows is positive if at times constructive BUT completely subjective – this is from MY point of view and isn’t intended as commentary on how it was for others.
An aside before proceeding. Being an extravert is a double edged sword. You are by type more comfortable to take part in a “live fire” environment, to process in the moment, to be able to respond and challenge. The double edged sword is with the energy of all those people and all that discussion how far do you go? I, by nature, cope with feeling uncomfortable by extroverting, I talk, ask questions, discuss etc and have noticed on several occasions recently that it is assumed by others as hogging, grand standing, over two-pennething. In contrast it appears that introverts cope with the same situation by watching, listening and digesting and the response is very different, no one appears to feel threatened by their response and in fact usually are very supportive in making them feel comfortable to contribute. All that by way of saying if at any point I trampled your point, hogged or appeared to grandstand it was largely (with a few exceptions) me coping with my own discomfort…
So, 24 hours later what has “interesting” become?
- What a fabulous group of people, whose intention is to learn, help, support, contribute, challenge and share
- As much as at times I adore chaos, the lack of structure in the unconference format was uncomfortable and left me wanting
- That said I think the unconference format has real legs and have come away excited about how it could be further applied in a corporate environment
- Visual minutes are awesome (check out creativeconnection.co.uk, Tim and his team do something incredible by turning the dialogue and emerging themes into artwork)
- Facilitation is good. With the aforementioned struggle between the extraverts and the introverts, having someone to ensure contribution from all and that the conversation doesn’t spiral off into freeform oblivion is good.
- There are lots of questions and with so many interested parties; the answers can be elusive especially without structure
- I would have liked a little (not a lot) bit of input, to hear what others are doing, not big scary case studies and by the numbers presentations, but someone saying “we do this and it works/doesn’t work”
- Live tweeting during an event is great especially if it’s viewable from “the floor” although it did take me a while to get used to people whopping their phones out and tapping away
- There was a lot of “stuff” out there yesterday and I felt like a missed loads.
- It is incredible what a group of people with common intent can achieve without permission, accreditation, incentive or financing
- However much you caveat it, an elephant in the room is still an elephant in the room
- Unconferencing is tiring but rewarding
If you work with people (and not just those with an HR job title or as I put it yesterday, in the HR cost centre) you should check out connectinghr.org or on Twitter check out the hashtags #chru & #connectinghr, whether you have a similar fear of networking to me or are a seasoned pro, it’s a really good group and will only get better.
I don’t feel this needs wrapping up as the points all stand on their own but there would be too many to thank for yesterday (both organisers and participants) but if one person should be singled out it’s Gareth Jones (@garelaos) () who’s networking activity keeps Starbucks going, has for me been the driving force to me engaging and remaining engaged with ConnectingHR and took the incessant piss taking yesterday with good grace and very few rebuttals!

Rob. Rarely has anyone been able to pull off taking the micheal so much out of me yet build me up too as you! You do it with aplomb! This is a well written and very well balanced review. I think your personality analysis is actually a really important part as it puts your feedback into context. Are you doing an MBA? XD
I have done a lot of thinking about the event, and will share my views separately over the weekend probably, but the structure and format is one that i am beginning to see as precious. Anyway, more on that later!
For now, thank you for the very kinds words. But without people like you, taking the step, particularly when its facing into a fear, it wouldn’t happen.
Hats off to you…
Pingback: Unconference: Less is more… « Inside My Head…
Nice post Rob.
As to some of your doubts and concerns I think Unconference can only make you tired if you expect from it the same you expect from conference. I have attended 2nd unconference this year and both left me more energetic rather than tired. ConnectingHR unconference has also worked for me as a charger rather than other way around. Running number of tracks simultaneously where topics are born as discussions flow has indeed lack of structure in it, yet I don’t think that it matters so much. It is the general feeling of contributing to discussion where nothing matters more than the mission to make HR better while having fun doing it. Maybe I am wrong and my perception does nothing than glorifying the unconference format with lack of evidence however as I contemplate on this idea of experimental learning (not the Kolb’s Experiential learning) something tells me to wait and see. So far I feel that the results of our learning that day in London have more to do with what has been happening to all of us, as we have tried and reflect on the whole experience while traveling home or even few days after that. Hence while unconference is over, the resonance of that event is still alive and kicking.
Thanks for sharing and looking forward for your part 2.

Ex Gratia Recordings is the brainchild of Emma and Paul Blackwood AKA Punkvert. It's a family business done for the love of music in the tradition of doing it for yrself. It also keeps us out of trouble.
The label was started in 2008 to release "Blessed are the cracked, for they let in the light" the debut LP by prank rockers – anarchistwood. An accompanying 7" single by Rude Mechanicals EXGRATIA/RUDE MECHANICALS "Irritating Fly" was also released at the same time. Rather share glory than covet it.
Sexton Ming exhibition & live performance THIS Friday 3 October in Deptford
No - that is his foot - not a Dummies. Dummie. Sexton is making a pilgrimage to London to play at the Deptford hang out The Bird's Nest on Friday 3rd October . He has a show there running from 3rd October - 26th November in the Undercurrents Gallery with Daniel Roch for a RARE chance to see Sexton in Person in London!!
UNDERCURRENTS GALLERY - DANIEL ROCH and SEXTON MING
Live music - new collaborative project 'Crafty'. Sexton teams up with Tom Bartlett of 'House of Fix'. An experiment in the endurance of the human body to certain frequencies.
Doors open 7 pm, gig at 9 pm sharp.
And not only that - there are newly bagged up limited edition cassettes from Sexton Ming now available around the corner at Vinyl - with a piece of art and a large jiffy bag to put your hair clips in too.....
Ex Gratia Recordings to be included in The British Library Archives
No - that is actually true... despite Prank Rock and all that shennanigans this story is bonafide 100% gold stamped real. Ex Gratia Recordings have been asked to contribute their work to the British Library Sound Archive ,formerly the National Sound Archive and be part of the Sound and Moving Image Archive. Naturually we are chuffed to bits that the likes of Miss Roberts & Rude Mechanicals, Handsum Pete, Sexton Ming, anarchistwood, Wonk Unit and Jesus Hooligan and all the other people who have appeared on our compilations work since 2008 will be represented in history of the music of our time - The late Noughties and beyond! Rejoice! and buy a piece of history right now so we can make some more wild recordings to pass down to future generations!
Sexton Ming - New Vinyl Album available now!
It's been a lonely three years for the cult of Sexton Ming. Whilst devotees waited patiently in the shadows for the next collection of psalms from their beloved pariah, the United Kingdom has fallen deeper into the clutches of malefic deceivers and empirical assholes.
Ming spent his time wisely, capturing the message in audio-format, avoiding the clever dicks, moving mountain and molehill alike, all whilst battling with the demons of negativity. The journey marks our biker sage leaving London for greener pastures. The parting gift to the proletariat? A potent collection of ear candy to help us all find the essence of our libertarian redemption.
After careful philosophical and spiritual consideration, a brush up with some rather dashing silver nail polish, experiments with 'witchypoo' and a run in with a dodgy fuck from Merseyside using the name “Luther Blisset”, Ming decided it is high-time to turn on our mojo, tune into Len and listen carefully...
True psyche ain't dead, the seas of change will crash down upon the magnates of greed and their administrators of credit-card doom are for the high jump into a rancid, bottomless pit. Retribution and an antidote to Generation Apathetic is here.
We urge to you to partake in the ritual of Ming and decipher this fifteen piece smorgasbord of outsider revelation. For you will find some comfort from the austere affliction bestowed upon yr soul, when you learn how to Protect and Survive. Don't think 1984 any more, think 2084! For the freaks shall inherit the Earth.
This latest transmission from Ex Gratia Recordings comes in memetic virus download and sacred vinyl picture disc format, limited to supply 300 Mingers.

"The Devil Wants To Be / Irritating Fly"
7” vinyl / 45rpm / full colour artwork / 500 copies / EXGr8 7.1 04/04/08
A pan-Dimensional Creature manifesting itself in your reality as an Absurd Rock Band consisting of Miss Roberts and her symbiotic slaves. In March 2001, after a performance of her surreal and absurd poetry, Miss Roberts joined with Guy Avern and Cos Chapman (Savage Earthworm Collective) and together formed the band. The performances are very theatrical and include such things as lessons in toe sucking, the mythology of Derek: the man who lives in the loft, and instructions on DIY flying.
"Blessed are the Cracked for They Let in the Light"
12” double vinyl / 33.3rpm / full colour artwork / 333 copies / EXGr8 LP 04/04/08
The flagship band for Ex Gratia, have been together since mid 2006. Early vocal contributions from the notorious gob$au$age's Mark and Susie led to dirty versions of Vagrant that can be heard on the album. Andro Ortiz added percussion to the early 'Wood line up and drums on several tracks on 'Blessed'. Singer/songwriter Marianne Hyatt added a melodic entity to the 'Wood between July 06 and March 08, much of which can be heard on the debut double album.

It was just a 90 minute flight from London's Gatwick Airport to Nice Airport where a quiet young man was waiting with a nice car to whisk us to our hotel. Gatwick which we reached in 35 minutes on the Gatwick Express train was a much quieter and less crowded airport than Heathrow. In Nice we were greeted by brilliant blue skies and a comfortable temperature of 19 degrees.
Already we have met some of our fellow cruisers and all are enthusiastically looking forward to being collected at 12:15 pm tomorrow for delivery to our ship that is moored just near our hotel.

Jan Brewer is claiming once more that she might try to challenge Arizona's laws which forbid her from running for a third term. This notion is based on some alleged ambiguity over whether the rules apply to her, since was first elevated to her current post in 2009 when then-Gov. Janet Napolitano left to become head of the Department of Homeland Security and has only been elected governor once. But mostly it seems like a way for Brewer to stave off lame-duck-ness, if legislators think she might actually serve another term.
Assuming, though, that this fever-dream won't become reality, a lot of names are already surfacing for possible 2014 bids. For Republicans, the Arizona Republic's early list includes Mesa Mayor Scott Smith, Secretary of State Ken Bennett, state Treasurer Doug Ducey, Attorney General Tom Horne, state Sen. Steve Pierce, and Mesa businessman Wil Cardon (who got whomped in the GOP Senate primary earlier this year by Jeff Flake).
For Democrats, some top possibilities are state Rep. Chad Campbell, Phoenix Mayor Greg Stanton, former Arizona Board of Regents Chairman Fred Duval, and attorney Felecia Rotellini (who ran against Horne for AG in 2010). One other longshot possibility for Team Blue: Rich Carmona, who just lost the Senate race. Everyone except Ducey and Duval is quoted in some manner, either not ruling out a run or saying they're "considering," though a Carmona spokesman says he wants to wait until all ballots are counted in this election before considering the next.
Senate:
• AK-Sen: It's hard not to feel like freshman Sen. Mark Begich is the Democrat with the biggest target painted on his back as we head into the 2014 election cycle: He won office in 2008 against an incredibly damaged incumbent in a very red state, which means his reelection chances probably start off at Tossup at best. So of course, Republicans are already lining up to run against him, and one GOP consultant even said to Roll Call that "it might be easier to ask which Republicans aren't considering taking on Begich." Indeed, at Netroots Nation in 2011, I asked Begich whom he might face and the list of names he rattled off was so long that I can scarcely remember a single one!
But fortunately, Kyle Trygstad's got a new list handy. He reports that Lt. Gov. Mead Treadwell and 2010 Senate nominee Joe Miller are already trying to line up support for potential bids, and adds that former Lt. Gov. Loren Leman, Anchorage Mayor Dan Sullivan, and even Gov. Sean Parnell might be interested. All that said, Begich is an excellent campaigner who, like Montana's Jon Tester, appears to have done a good job carving out a distinct profile for himself back home. What's more, Begich won't face the pressure of the presidential race bearing down on him from the top of the ticket; indeed, in 2008, he had to deal with Sarah Palin. And one positive note is that Barack Obama appears to have taken a higher share of the vote in Alaska last week than any Democrat since Hubert Humphrey. This will definitely be a hard-fought race.
• MA-Sen: I'm not really going to get into it at this point, since it's all too speculative, but Aaron Blake runs down what would happen if Sen. John Kerry were tapped as the next Secretary of Defense (or perhaps, Secretary of State). Massachusetts is one of the few states which requires special elections to fill Senate vacancies (as you'll recall from the original Scott Brown debacle), and the law also allows the governor to appoint a temporary replacement pending such an election. Blake has a list of possible candidates, if you're interested.
• ME-Sen: Even Angus will have to finally make a decision: The Senate's leadership elections for the 113th Congress will be held on Wednesday, and independent Angus King—who has steadfastly refused to say which party he'll caucus with—now says he wants to be able to participate. (Previously he'd said he wouldn't make up his mind until after Thanksgiving, which makes me wonder if he wasn't even aware of when the leadership vote was scheduled for.) Anyhow, if Angus somehow wants to join the demoralized and deep-in-the-minority Republicans, he's welcome to do so: 54 is still greater than 46.
Gubernatorial:
• NE-Gov: As expected, state Sen. Mike Flood has formally declared his candidacy for the Nebraska governor's mansion, which will be open in 2014 because current Gov. Dave Heineman is term-limited. Flood, the Speaker in the state's unicameral legislature, will face (at the very least) Lt. Gov. Rick Sheehy—who has Heineman's backing—in the GOP primary, but there are a number of other potential candidates. On the Republican side, the Great Mentioner cites state Sen. Charlie Janssen, Attorney General Jon Bruning, and state Treasurer Don Stenberg. And while this would be an exceptionally tough race for Democrats, a few names are circulating as well, including state Sen. Steve Lathrop, who says he's considering a run; University of Nebraska Regent Chuck Hassebrook and Lincoln Mayor Chris Beutler are also possibilities.
House:
• AZ-01: Republican Jonathan Paton, whose race was called last week, has now finally conceded to Democrat Ann Kirkpatrick.
• AZ-02: There's still one uncalled race in Arizona, in the state's 2nd District, where Dem Rep. Ron Barber's lead over Republican Martha McSally now stands at 829 votes as of Tuesday evening, up from 512 the day before. Unlike almost all other overtime races, where one side's lead has steadily grown, Barber's edge has bounced around, and indeed, on election night, he was even trailing. Still, as the total number of outstanding ballots shrinks, you'd always rather be the guy in the lead.
But here's a dispiriting development: Republican attorneys in AZ-02 are going to court to try to prevent 130 provisional ballots cast in a heavily Latino precinct in Cochise County from being counted.
• CA-07: Awesome! It's freshman orientation, Capitol Hill-style, which means all newly-elected soon-to-be members of the House are down in DC, learning the ins and outs of Congress, from an insider's perspective. And just which insider is leading these 80 or so bright-eyed newcomers through their orientation program? None other than GOP Rep. Dan Lungren, chair of the House Administration Committee, who is currently trailing Democrat Ami Bera by 1,779 votes in a race that still hasn't been called. Somehow I'm guessing Lungren might be a little distracted these next few days ...
Speaking of which, Bera continues to expand his lead over Lungen in suburban Sacramento. As of Tuesday evening, Bera's more than doubled his edge—now 3,824 votes—from the previous update. Approximately 80,000 votes remain to be counted across the county, slightly more than half of which should be in CA-07. Assuming there are roughly 50,000 votes left to be split between Bera and Lungren, Lungren's magic number is now 53.8 percent. The same math that is hurting GOP Rep. Brian Bilbray in San Diego is affecting Lungren, too. The number of votes left to be counted continues to drop, and the newly counted votes seem to be more Bera-friendly: The last batch of votes broke for Bera 54-46! Given this, we can all turn our attention to a new race: Who will concede first, Lungren or Bilbray?
• FL-18: Jesus. So now the state of Florida is getting involved in the Patrick Murphy-Allen West race. The Florida Department of State, which oversees statewide elections, is sending three officials to St. Lucie County, which just conducted an unorthodox partial recount that saw 799 total votes disappear compared to earlier tallies. (Apparently, the proper term for this effort was a "retabulation," not a recount, which is an entirely different matter under state law.) In a statement, a DoS spokesperson said: "We are concerned whenever there is a question about the accuracy of results." Great.
And on top of that, a hundred West supporters have taken to protesting outside the St. Lucie elections board offices, carrying signs accusing god-knows-whom of "voter fraud" and berating elections chief Gertrude Walker as "Dirty Gertie." The Brooks Brothers riot this is not, though (video here).
Fortunately, though, an end might be in sight. On Nov. 20, the state's formal Election Canvassing Commission will meet to certify all election returns. If the election is certified for Murphy, that will narrow West's options. And Politico's Alex Isenstadt reports that some unnamed and unquoted "Republican officials" "privately acknowledge that West has few legal avenues to pursue and that, absent a major shift in the trajectory of the vote count, will soon come under pressure to concede." We need to get clarity on the actual vote, for sure. But there really doesn't seem to be any shot for West, though if anyone will drag this out needlessly, it's him.
• LA-02: Here's another one of those "closer than expected" House elections, but with a twist. Freshman Dem Rep. Cedric Richmond won reelection with "only" 55 percent of the vote in Louisiana's dark blue 2nd Congressional District... but his nearest opponent took just 25 percent, so it's not like he was in any danger. For one thing, as you know, Louisiana conducts "jungle"-style elections that are very similar to the top-two primaries used in California and Washington: All candidates compete in a single general election (there's no primary), and if no one gets over 50 percent, the two top candidate, regardless of party, proceed to a December runoff. So Richmond was running in a field of five, and indeed, the second-place finisher, Gary Landrieu (a cousin of Sen. Mary Landrieu and NOLA Mayor Mitch Landrieu) is also a Democrat. (Mary and Mitch both endorsed the incumbent.)
The other issue, though, is redistricting. Louisiana lost a seat in reapportionment, and Republicans (who by-and-large controlled the line-drawing process, though LA politics is very weird) sought to pack as many Democrats as possible into a single district, the 2nd. The led them to create a district which stretched 100 miles from New Orleans all the way to Baton Rouge. (The old 2nd used to be entirely NOLA-centric.) It also left Richmond, who after all had served just a single term, with a seat where almost 40% of the constituents were new to him. That kind of phenomenon has played out in many races across the country, leading to lots of incumbents pulling in lower vote shares than you'd otherwise anticipate. I expect, though, that things will "get back to normal" next cycle.
• MI-08: This could lead to a potentially interesting special election: The Great Mentioner is, of course, already talking about possible replacements for now-former CIA Director David Petraeus, and one name that's come up is Michigan GOP Rep. Mike Rogers. Rogers is chair of the House Intelligence Committee and is also a former FBI agent himself. If Rogers were to be tapped, that would open up a district which actually went for Barack Obama by a 52-46 margin over John McCain in 2008. (2012 numbers are not yet available.) Any thoughts on possible candidates on both sides who could succeed Rogers?
• MI-11: Here's a neat little story on Dave Curson, the Democratic union official who defeated Republican Kerry Bentivolio in the special election for the final two months of ex-Rep. Thad McCotter's term, even as Bentivolio was beating another Democrat, Syed Taj, in the race for the full term that starts in January. One detail I liked: For his seven-week sojourn, Curson will occupy McCotter's "palatial suite in the Rayburn building," and fellow Michigan Rep. John Dingell will lend him some staff members for the duration. Curson also says he "doubts very much" that he'd run against Bentivolio in 2014, but isn't ruling it out.
Incidentally, Curson was sworn in on Tuesday, along with two other special election winners: Democrat Suzan DelBene in WA-01 and Republican Thomas Massie in KY-04. One other special election winner, Democrat Donald Payne, Jr. of NJ-10, will be sworn in later this week.
• NH-01: Reid Wilson reports that Republican state Sen. Sharon Carson, who was just re-elected last week, is already interested in taking on Dem Rep.-elect Carol Shea-Porter in 2014.
Grab Bag:
• Demographics: There's quite a lot of agreement that Texas is on a trajectory toward being a swing state, simply given the high rate of non-white growth there... we know it's a long-term project, though, but how long? Well, the Houston Chronicle set their numbers-crunchers to figuring that out, and the answer is: not as quickly as we'd like, but there is a light at the end of the tunnel, somewhere around 2024.
That's when their straight-line extrapolation finds that Democratic presidential votes will reach parity with Republican ones, based on expecting current population and political participation trends to continue unimpeded; they see the Democrats getting 5% closer in 2016 and 2020, closing the current 15% gap by 2024. (Of course, any number of variables could change that, such as the GOP making better inroads among Latino voters, or the Dems getting better participation rates out of Latino voters.) (David Jarman)
• DSCC: While Republicans seem to already know who's going to lead their Senate campaign committee (see NRSC item below), Democrats are still casting about for a successor to Washington Sen. Patty Murray, who led the DSCC during its victorious 2012 cycle. Of course, 2014 will be an utter bear: With Democrats almost entirely on defense, it'll make 2012 look like Super Mario Bros. hacked to give you unlimited lives and permanent fireballs. So yeah, there probably aren't a lot of eager takers for the job, though Politico's Maggie Haberman reports that Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet "was offered the post" and is apparently considering it. (Bennet turned down the same opportunity last cycle, though.)
Other possibles include Sens. Amy Klobuchar (MN), Kirsten Gillibrand (NY), and Sheldon Whitehouse (RI), all of whom just won their second elections by resounding margins. Whoever gets the gig will mostly have to focus on fundraising, though recruiting may be important depending on whether certain members retire, like West Virginia's Jay Rockefeller and South Dakota's Tim Johnson. The good news is that expectations have to be very low for whomever takes the job, so a tough showing next cycle probably won't damage anyone's career.
• Governors: PPP is out with a helpful summary of where incumbent governors facing reelection stand, in terms of approval and matchups against generic opponents. This isn't new data, but it's from their last round of 2012 pre-election polling (where it got little attention in the face of the 2012 races), so it isn't stale either.
They break them down into three categories: the ones in a whole lot of trouble (four GOPers: Pennsylvania's Tom Corbett, Maine's Paul LePage, Florida's Rick Scott, and Ohio's John Kasich), those looking favored for now (Michigan's Rick Snyder, Wisconsin's Scott Walker, and Iowa's Terry Branstad, plus Connecticut Dem Dan Malloy), and those looking pretty safe (Minnesota Dem Mark Dayton, Colorado Dem John Hickenlooper, and Nevada GOPer Brian Sandoval). And if you're jonesing for your next poll injection, they say they'll resume 2013/14 cycle polling after Thanksgiving. (David Jarman)
• NRCC, NRSC: Looks like the GOP is just about done figuring out who will lead its two federal campaign committees next cycle. Oregon Rep. Greg Walden has circulated a letter asking his colleagues to support him as NRCC chair, which seems like a done deal. The only person who might have thwarted him was current chair Pete Sessions of Texas, who said back in September he might seek a third term on the job. But Sessions and Walden are apparently tight, and so it looks like bossman is clearing the way for his deputy to succeed him.
Meanwhile, on the NRSC front, Ohio Sen. Rob Portman is reportedly pulling his name from consideration. That pretty much leaves freshman Kansas Sen. Jerry Moran as the only Republican who has expressed interest in the job, so he looks like a safe bet to succeed Texas Sen. John Cornyn.
• Pres-by-CD: It's that time again! Soon we're going to start crunching the 2012 presidential election results for all 435 congressional districts. But, as always, this is a huge task, and we're going to need your help, which is why we're crowdsourcing the effort once again. So click on over and see how you can get involved. Your assistance is greatly appreciated, and it'll help us produce an important data set for political analysts as quickly as possible.

If you believe that you are entitled to success, that you were smart enough to make it through med school and therefore this will be a breeze, and that your medical pedigree is enough to get you results, you may be headed for disappointment.

The mobile game is raking in the dollars, not because its content is good, but because every second tap brings up a purchase pop-up — most of them $99.
The mobile game is raking in the dollars, not because its content is good, but because every second tap brings up a purchase pop-up — most of them $99.
We thought My Little Pony 's in-app price gouging was bad — but that was until we met a little iOS game called Super Monster Bros by Adventure Time Pocket Free Games from Mario Games Casas Team. We stumbled across it using the search term "Adventure Time" (looking to see if Fionna Fights was available here yet. Good news: it is).
The game itself looks like something of a Mario clone, even including Mario sounds in the gameplay, but with Pokémon instead of Mario (you start with a Charmander). Unfortunately, that's just par for the course in certain parts of the iTunes app store. It's also par for the course for developers who just don't get how to entice gamers with good rewards and stellar gameplay to try and wring as many cents as they can out of unsuspecting players.
However, Super Monster Bros by Adventure Time Pocket Free Games might possibly be in a league of its own. Almost every action leads to a pop-up requesting that the player pay large sums of money to unlock parts of a not even well designed game. IGN filmed the gameplay here. While it might be a relatively easy matter to just dismiss the pop-up, something is clearly working. We've never seen an iTunes "Top In-App Purchases" list quite like this:
What makes it worse is that we strongly suspect that the game is aimed at children. The bright colours, the Pokémon, the fact that it shows up in a search for Adventure Time all point to the seller relying on kids not knowing what it means when they tap "OK". And to make it even worse, there's a paid version.
Unfortunately, there are always going to be games like this in iTunes, but there are a number of ways you can protect yourself. Firstly, always check a game's star rating. If it has a lot of low ratings, it's probably not very good, even if it just means that it's a bad game. However, this isn't necessarily a guarantee.
If you have kids who regularly play games on your iOS device, or just don't trust yourself not to absentmindedly make a purchase you don't intend to, your best bet is to put purchases on full password protection. By default, iOS devices are shipped requiring a password in order to authorise a purchase, but there's a 15-minute window wherein you can make as many purchases as you like without entering the password. Here's how you can set it so that it requests a password every single time.
Go to Settings and scroll down to "General"
Inside the General menu, scroll down until you see Restrictions
Once in, tap "Enable Restrictions" at the top of the screen. It will ask you to enter a four-digit code. This is for the restrictions only; no one can change the restrictions settings without the code
Scroll down until you see "In-App Purchases". Make sure it is set to the On position
Go into the option below and change it from "15 Minutes" to "Immediate". Your iDevice will now ask for your password any time you, or your child, try to make a purchase.Battery MINDer 12 Volt 2 Amp Charger Maintainer Conditioner BM2012

Executive Overview
Following in the footsteps of the already well-established Olympus Camedia C-series of digicams, the C-720 Ultra Zoom combines all the best exposure features of the series with a true, 8x zoom lens. In addition to the long-ratio zoom lens, the C-720's advanced features include ISO settings ranging from 100 to 400,-720. It sports the same compact SLR-style design as the C-3020 and C-4040 -- Olympus' recently updated 3x zoom Camedia models -- with nearly identical dimensions except for a slightly longer lens assembly. In fact, compared to other 8x zoom digicams currently on the market (June 2000), the C-720 is remarkably compact, measuring only 4.2 x 3.0 x 3.1 inches (107.5 x 76.0 x 77.5 mm) with the lens retracted, and only an inch added with the lens fully extended. It weighs just 11.0 ounces (315 grams) without batteries, light enough to fit into a large purse or waist pack, but its classic silver and metallic grey color combination, enhanced by a satin finish, makes it deserving of its own protective camera bag or pouch.
The C-720 features an "electronic" optical viewfinder, which is essentially a miniaturized version of the larger, 1.5-inch, TFT color LCD monitor. The C-720's EVF is bright and clear, with a good, high eyepoint that makes it comfortable to use by eyeglass wearers. Both the LCD and EVF have detailed information displays and provide access to the LCD menu system. The EVF remains active at all times, but with surprisingly little negative impact on battery life. The 6.4-51.2mm 8x zoom lens is equivalent to a 40-320mm lens on a 35mm camera, with a maximum aperture of f/2.8-f/3.4 (wide angle to telephoto). In addition to the C-720's 8x optical zoom, images can be enlarged up to an additional 3x with the "digital zoom," effectively increasing the camera's zoom capabilities to 24x. (Keep in mind though, that digital zoom directly trades off image quality for magnification, because it simply crops out and enlarges the central pixels of the CCD.) The C-720's default image resolution is 1,984 x 1,488 pixels, but lower resolutions of 1,600 x 1,200, 1,280 x 960, 1,024 x 768, and 640 x 480 are also available. Image quality options include two JPEG compression ratios, plus an uncompressed mode that produces full-resolution TIFF images.
The C-720 offers a great deal of exposure control, including Program, Aperture Priority, Shutter Speed Priority, and Manual exposure modes. Program mode controls both aperture and shutter speed, with exposure times as long as one second. Aperture and Shutter Priority modes give you control over aperture or shutter speed, while the camera chooses the best corresponding settings. When used in AP or SP modes, apertures range from f/2.8 to f/7.1 and shutter speeds from 1/1,000 to 1/2 seconds. The Manual exposure mode provides the same aperture range, but permits shutter speeds as long as eight seconds. You can also put the camera into full Auto mode, or select between Portrait, Sports, and Landscape / Portrait scene modes for easy capture of what might otherwise be tricky subjects.
The C-720 provides four ISO options (Auto, 100, 200, and 400), automatic exposure bracketing, Digital ESP Multi-patterned and spot metering modes, plus exposure compensation from +2 to -2 exposure values (EV) in one-third-step increments. White balance options include Auto, Daylight, Overcast, Tungsten, or Fluorescent, to accommodate a variety of lighting conditions. Image contrast and sharpness adjustments are available through the LCD menu, and a Playback menu option lets you make copies of images in black and white or sepia tones. An adjustable Automatic Exposure Lock (AEL) function locks an exposure reading, without having to hold down the Shutter button halfway while you reframe the image. There's also a 12-second self-timer option for self-portraits, and a "2 in 1" capture mode that records two half-sized images and saves them side-by-side as one full resolution image.
The C-720's Movie mode records QuickTime movies without sound, in either SQ (160 x 120 pixels) or HQ (320 x 240 pixels) modes. Provided of course that the memory card has sufficient space to store the files, SQ movies may be as long as 70 seconds apiece, while HQ mode movies can be up to 16 seconds long. Two Sequence modes capture multiple images as fast as 1.2 frames per second (depending on file size), with an AF Sequence mode that adjusts the focus between each shot. Finally, Panorama mode lets you take up to 10 specially "tagged" shots for merging with Camedia's Panorama Stitch software on your computer. The camera's internal, pop-up flash unit offers six operating modes (Auto, Red-Eye Reduction, Fill-in Flash, Flash Off, Night Scene, and Night Scene with Red-Eye Reduction modes), with adjustable flash intensity.
The Olympus C-720 Ultra Zoom ships with a 16MB SmartMedia memory card for image storage. Larger capacity cards are available separately, up to the current (June, 2002) limit of 128 MB. 4.0 utility package, a capable all-in-one image management program that provides basic organization and editing tools, in addition to a panorama "stitching" application. Apple QuickTime and USB drivers for Mac and Windows are also supplied.
I've always been pleased with Olympus' C-series of digicams and the flexibility they provide, and immediately liked the C-720 UltraZoom. Though some of the more in-depth manual controls of the C-3020 and C-4040 have been left out, the C-720 offers a nice array of exposure options and can still handle a wide range of shooting conditions. The availability of full manual exposure control, as well as a range of preset scene modes gives the camera wide appeal to novices and more experienced amateurs alike. The benefit of 8x optical zoom practically goes without saying, and the EVF viewfinder provides much more accurate framing than a standard optical viewfinder. Overall, the C-720 Ultra Zoom is a nice addition to the Camedia line.
Design than I do.)
Viewfinder
The
C-720 Zoom offers both a 0.5-inch electronic viewfinder and a rear panel, 1.5-inch,
TFT color LCD screen, each with approximately 114,000 pixels. (This looks fine
on the rear panel display, but the EVF display seems pretty coarse: I really
have to question whether there's actually the same number of pixels in both,
the rear-panel LCD clearly seems much sharper.) The EVF display also behaves
a little oddly (IMHO) with moving objects or during rapid panning of the camera:
I don't think it's a refresh rate issue, but the image blurs noticeably when
you move the camera, or when an object moves across the field of view quickly.
When things become more or less stationary again, the display seems to sharpen.
The electronic viewfinder (EVF) accommodates eyeglass wearers with a diopter
correction adjustment and a comfortably high eyepoint, leaving enough room between
your eye and the finder for most eyeglass lenses to fit in. The tiny display
is identical to that of the larger LCD monitor, complete with menus and exposure
information. The EVF remains active at all times, which would usually result
in rather short battery life. On the 720 though, battery life is over 200 minutes
in capture mode with the EVF active, a commendable figure.
My regular readers will already know that I'm no fan of electronic viewfinders. They seem to be a necessary evil with long-zoom cameras, as it'd be prohibitively expensive and bulky to include an optical viewfinder with an 8x zoom to match the lens. EVFs do have the dual advantages of providing true "through the lens" (TTL) viewing, as well as a the same information display as on rear-panel LCDs, but to my mind the negatives outweigh the positives. My biggest objection to them is that they are generally useless for low light shooting, and the EVF on the C-720 UltraZoom is no exception. In my testing, it proved to be barely usable at light levels of 1/2 foot-candle (5.5 lux), while the camera was capable of recording usable images at light levels 8x lower. (Although the autofocus only worked reliably down to levels of about 1 foot-candle.)
The C-720's LCD monitor is controlled by the Display button located just off its lower right corner. Pressing the button simply turns the main LCD display on or off, but doesn't affect the information display or the EVF display. A detailed information readout on both monitors subject or lighting. The Manual mode displays the selected f/stop and shutter speed values together, while the exposure compensation value reports when a setting is over- or underexposed by glowing red. In my testing, I found the viewfinder display to be very accurate, showing only about 99 percent of the final image area. (Excellent performance, since I generally expect LCD monitors to be as close to 100 percent accuracy as possible.)
When using the LCD monitor to review captured images, you can zoom in.
Optics). The Macro / Spot button on the back
panel adjusts the focus range for closeup subjects, and includes an option for
spot metering in Macro mode. Autofocus is determined through the lens, using
a contrast detection method. This means that the autofocus will work properly
with auxiliary lenses,.
Exposure
The C-720 Zoom offers fairly extensive turning the Mode dial on top of the camera, which also accesses the My Mode, Movie, and Playback modes. (My Mode lets you create a custom setup for the camera, including virtually every exposure and operating parameter, that can then be selected simply by rotating the Mode Dial to the "My" position. See below for more information.)
In Auto mode, the camera has complete control over the exposure parameters. You have control over options like zoom, drive mode, image size, etc., but no exposure adjustments at all (not even exposure compensation or white balance - this is truly a "point & 2 EV units, in steps of 0.3 EV. Aperture Priority lets you set the aperture from f/2.8 to f/7.1  8 when everything is OK. If it disagrees with your choice, the exposure differential shows in red how much under- or overexposed the image will be, based on the camera's own calculations. The exposure differential shows up as an exposure equivalent (EV) value, with the difference shown within a range of +3 to -3 EV. This is a very handy feature that I'd like to see implemented in the manual exposure modes of more cameras.
Three scene modes include Portrait, Sports, and Landscape-Portrait modes, which optimize the camera for specific shooting situations. In Portrait mode, the camera uses a larger lens aperture, which captures the subject in sharp focus in front of a slightly soft-focused background. Sports mode biases the exposure system toward faster shutter speeds, to help freeze fast-moving subjects. Finally, Landscape-Portrait mode uses a smaller lens aperture, to help keep both the foreground and background in sharp focus. Limited menu options are available in the scene modes, as their purpose is to simplify camera setup for novices. (A multitude of menu choices would only add complication to what are intended to be easy-to-use camera settings.)
The C-720 features a variable ISO setting, which lets you set the camera's light sensitivity to 100, 200, or 400 ISO equivalents, or to an Auto mode. The higher sensitivity settings, combined with the camera's maximum eight-second shutter speed, provide good low-light shooting capabilities. In my tests, the C-720 performed well at low light levels, capturing clear images with great color (see the test results section below). The higher ISO settings are also helpful when you want faster shutter speeds in normal lighting, to help freeze fast action. Of course, as with all digicams, the higher ISO settings produce photos with more image noise, much as higher-ISO film shows more film grain.
Two metering systems are available on the C-720: that.)
A Record View function can be enabled through the Record menu, which displays the most recently captured image on the LCD screen while the image is being recorded to the memory card. You can set the Record View to display the image only, or to display the image with a confirmation screen, letting you delete the image before it's saved to the card. This is a nice way to check your shots and not waste time switching back and forth between Playback and Record modes. There's also a Quick View function that lets you check the previously captured image, by pressing the Monitor button twice in quick succession. The most recent. Or, you can use the Auto Exposure Bracketing (AEB) function to automatically bracket an exposure as much as +/- 2 EV in either three or five step increments of 0.3, 0.6, or 1.0 EV units each. (NOTE that the number of shots you can take in AEB mode can be limited by your image resolution/quality setting. In SHQ mode, the bracketing series is limited to 3 shots. In HQ and lower size/quality settings, the full 5 shot series is available. Bracketing is not available at all when you're recording uncompressed TIFF images.), and need to do so quickly.
White balance can be set to Auto, Daylight, Overcast, Tungsten, or Fluorescent, through the Record menu, to accommodate a variety of lighting situations. (Given the other advanced capabilities of the C-720, I'd really like to have seen a manual white balance option as well.) The C-720 UltraZoom and contrast. This last option is one that I personally find particularly appealing: I find that I often want to decrease a camera's default contrast somewhat, to help preserve highlight detail on contrasty subjects. The "Low" contrast option provided by the C-720 is just right for that purpose.
Flash
The
C-720 offers a built-in, pop-up flash, with six operating modes: Auto, Red-Eye
Reduction, Fill-in Flash, Flash Off, Night Scene, and Night Scene, which reduces the occurrence of the Red-Eye Effect. Night Scene
allows more ambient light into the background, producing more natural lighting
behind a flash-illuminated subject. A button on top of the camera releases the
flash from its compartment, while the Flash / Protect button on the back panel
controls the flash operating mode. You can also adjust the overall flash intensity
from +/-2 EV through the Record menu.
The C-720's flash has an unusually long operating range, rated by Olympus for up to 18 feet with the lens set to wide angle, and up to 14.8 feet in telephoto. This agrees well with my own tests, as the flash showed good brightness up to the 14 foot limit of my flash range test.
One of the features of the original C-700 UltraZoom that's most regrettably missing on the C-720 is the external flash sync terminal. The C-700 had one, the C-720 doesn't. :-(
Special Exposure Modes
Movie Mode
The C-720's Movie mode is accessible via the Mode dial on top of the camera (marked with a small movie camera symbol). Once in Movie mode, you can record QuickTime movies (without sound). The length of movie clips depends on the resolution setting and the amount of memory card space. At the 320 x 240-pixel size, movie clips can last as long as 15 seconds. You can record much longer clips at the 160 x 120-pixel resolution setting (up to 70 seconds). A number indicating the available seconds of movie storage on the SmartMedia card appears on the LCD and EVF monitors. You can use the digital zoom while recording movies, but the zoom action is slower than usual. (Most cameras I've tested don't permit any zoom during movie capture.) I was really surprised though, to see that Movie Mode forces the optical zoom lens to its wide angle setting. - What's the point of an amazing zoom lens, if you don't get to use it. Most cameras don't permit zooming during recording, but most will let you adjust the zoom before you start recording. (Olympus: How about it? Give us zoom in movie mode on the next model?) Spot metering, exposure compensation, focus lock, self-timer, ISO, and white balance are also available in Movie mode, all of which are likewise unusual features to find available during Movie recording. Both resolutions record at approximately 15 frames per second.
Panorama Mode
Like most Olympus digicams, the C-720 offers a Panorama exposure mode when using an Olympus brand panorama-enabled SmartMedia memory the built-in panorama firmware found only on Olympus brand memory cards. Images are saved individually and then assembled on a computer using the (included) Olympus Mode
The C-720 also offers a Sequence mode that mimics the motor drive on a film camera, continually recording images for as long as the Shutter button is held down or until the memory runs out (this varies with the image quality setting and available SmartMedia space). The maximum frame rate is rated to be1.2 frames per second, although my own testing showed rates as high as 1.47 fps when recording in small/basic mode. As is usually the case though, the number of frames you can capture quickly is limited by the camera's buffer memory capacity. At maximum size and JPEG quality, you're limited to three or four rapid-fire shots. Sequence mode isn't available at all for the TIFF (uncompressed) image format. The AF Sequence mode also captures a rapid series of images, but adjusts focus between each shot, resulting in much slower shot to shot times (about 3 seconds). 1 millisecond.)
The C-720 is an average to somewhat slow camera overall. Startup and shutdown are a little leisurely, as the telescoping lens mechanism is rather deliberate in its motions. Shot to shot time is 3.3 seconds or so, despite a fairly good-sized buffer memory. (This isn't a terrible time, but it isn't an industry-leading one either.) Autofocus speed is also a little slow, even when compared to other long-zoom cameras. - This results in a shutter lag that ranges from 1.29 to 1.45 seconds. Continuous shooting mode does pretty well, with a frame rate of 1.47 frames/second, up to the limit of the 4-frame buffer. All in all, not terribly slow, but a faster shutter response could have made this an excellent camera for sports shooting. As it is, unless you can prefocus the camera in advance of the action, you'd have a hard time capturing critical moments. (On the other hand, if you're dealing with subjects where shutter lag isn't that important, the C-720 gives great long-zoom performance at a bargain price.)
Operation and User Interface
The C-720's user interface is similar to that of other recent Olympus C-series digicams, so it didn't take long for me to get familiar with the camera. Even for users new to the interface, the menu layouts are quite straightforward. Because the EVF is active at all times, and displays the same information as the larger LCD monitor, you can quickly verify basic camera settings while aligning a shot, without having to activate the larger LCD display. A handful of external control buttons change the camera's basic settings, and a Mode dial on top of the changes capture modes quickly. The AE Lock button can be customized to activate a number of settings, another potential time saver during shooting. When you do have to call up the LCD menu, a shortcut screen appears first, with quick links to the image quality, white balance, and ISO settings. (You can also edit the shortcuts through the Setup menu.) Once you get into the actual Record menu, options are organized by subject,, control layout is quite intuitive and efficient.
Control Enumeration
Mode Dial: On the top of the camera is the Mode Dial, which controls the camera's operating mode. Choices are Playback, Auto, Landscape/Portrait, Sports, Portrait, Program / Aperture / Shutter Speed / Manual (P/A/S/M), My Mode, and Movie modes.
Zoom Lever: On top of the camera, in front of the Mode Dial, the Zoom Lever controls the optical zoom in all exposure modes, and the Digital Zoom when enabled through the Record menu.
In Playback mode, the lever switches between Index view, normal image display, and playback zoom., Night Scene, and Night Scene with Red-Eye Reduction modes.
In Playback mode, this button marks the displayed image for write-protection, or removes protection. Once protected, files cannot be erased or manipulated in any way, except through card formatting.
Spot / Macro / Print Button: Directly to the left of the Flash / Erase the image is selected, you can set the number of copies, whether or not to print the date and time stamp on the photo, and print a cropped area of the image.
Drive / Erase Button: Adjacent to the viewfinder eyepiece, on the right side, this button controls the camera's drive setting in all still capture modes (that is, all capture modes except Movie), cycling through Single-Frame Shooting, Sequential Shooting, AF Sequential Shooting, Self-Timer, and Auto Exposure Bracketing modes.
In Playback mode, this button lets you erase the current image.
Diopter Adjustment Dial: To the right of the viewfinder eyepiece, this dial adjusts the electronic viewfinder (EVF) to accommodate eyeglass wearers. any other menu function.
In Playback mode, this button rotates the image display clockwise in increments of 90 degrees.
Four-Way Arrow Pad and OK / Menu Button: Made up of four buttons arranged in a circle around a single "OK" button,.
Display Button: Diagonal from the lower left corner of the LCD monitor, this button turns the LCD monitor on or off. If pressed twice in quick succession, it displays the Quick View function, which calls up the previously captured image on the screen. A third press returns the LCD to its normal display.
Camera Modes and Menus
Movie
Mode: Accessed by turning the Mode dial to the movie camera symbol, Movie
mode lets you capture movies (without sound) for as long as the SmartMedia
puts the camera in charge of aperture and shutter speed, while Aperture and
Shutter Priority modes give the user control over one exposure variable and
the camera control over the other. Manual mode offers full user control over
both aperture and shutter speed. Apertures range from f/2.8 to f/7.1, depending
on the zoom setting. Shutter speeds range from 1/1,000 to 1/30 second in Program
and Aperture Priority modes, extend to 1/2 second in Shutter Priority mode,
and to eight seconds in Manual mode.
Portrait
Mode: Optimizes the camera for capturing portraits. A larger aperture is
used, so that the subject is sharply focused in front of a slightly soft background.
Sports
Mode: The camera's exposure system is biased toward faster shutter speeds
to freeze action with moving subjects.
Landscape
/ Portrait Mode: This mode is best for capturing wide views of scenery or
portraits in front of landscapes. The camera uses a smaller aperture setting,
which increases the depth of field to capture both the foreground and background
in sharp focus.
Auto
Mode: The final capture mode on the Mode dial, this mode puts the camera
in charge of everything, except for zoom, flash mode, image size, and drive
mode. This is a true "point & shoot" mode, requiring almost no
input from the user apart from a press of the shutter button..
Still Picture Shooting Menu: (Note that available menu options will change depending on capture mode.)

Image Storage and Interface
The
C-720 uses 3V (3.3V) SmartMedia memory cards and comes equipped with a 16MB
card. Currently (June, 2002), SmartMedia cards are available in sizes as large
as 128MB.
The C-720 can store images in both uncompressed TIFF and compressed JPEG file formats. JPEG compression levels include Super High Quality (SHQ), High Quality (HQ), and Standard Quality (SQ). Both SHQ and HQ settings record files at the 1,984 x 1,488 pixel size, while the SQ compression level has several options. SQ1 records files at 1,600 x 1,200 pixels, and SQ2 records files at either 1,280 x 960, 1,024 x 768, or 640 x 480 pixel sizes.
The C-720 C-720 comes with interface software and cables for both Mac and Windows computers. It employs a USB interface for high-speed computer connection. I clocked the C-720's download speed at 540 KBytes/second when connected to my G4 PowerMac. This is at the upper end of the speed range for digicams I've tested, with only a few models coming in faster. Like most (all?) other current Olympus digicams, the C-720 is a USB storage-class device. Olympus refers to this as "USB Auto-Connect," and it means that you can connect it to computers running Windows Me, XP, or 2000 or Mac OS8.6 or later, without the need to load separate driver software. (Very nice if you're traveling and want to offload images on a computer in an internet cafe or other computer-for-hire venue.)-720 has a Video Out port which supports the NTSC timing format. (I.)
Power
The
C-720. As usual, I measured the C-720's power consumption
in various operating modes, and translated the results into estimated minutes
of runtime for each. (Based on a set of true 1600 mAh capacity NiMH batteries.)
The C-720's battery life is pretty good, better than many compact cameras, but not as good as larger models using hefty LiIon battery packs. Ultimate battery life is limited somewhat by the need to keep the EVF display running in order to aim the camera and compose your shots. I was surprised by how good runtime was in capture mode with only the EVF active though: Over 3 1/2 hours of continuous operation, much better than average among EVF-equipped cameras I've tested. Overall, battery life is pretty good, although I still-720 comes with a nice complement of software on the supplied CD. Direct camera control and image downloading are provided by Olympus' Camedia Master software package (Version 4.0) for both Mac and Windows platforms (Macintosh OS 8.6-9.2/OS X, Windows 98/98SE/Me/2000 Pro/XP). USB drivers for both platforms and an Apple QuickTime reader are also included.

As with all Imaging Resource product tests, we encourage you to let your own eyes be the judge of how well the camera performed. Explore the images on the pictures page, to see how C-720 images compare to other cameras you may be considering.
Overall, the C-720 Ultra Zoom performed well, producing pretty accurate color in most cases. For the most part, the camera's white balance system handled my testing well, with the Auto option typically providing the best results. However, I often noticed a slight warm cast with the Auto setting, particularly under our studio lights. The camera had a little trouble with the difficult incandescent lighting of the Indoor Portrait (without flash), producing a slightly warm color balance under both the Auto and Incandescent white balance settings. - Far from the worst I've seen, but more than I'd personally prefer. Despite the slight warm cast, the C-720 did a good job with the large color blocks of the Davebox target, with good saturation as well. The camera had some trouble with the awkward blues in the flower bouquet in the outdoor test shot, darkening the tone and shifting the color into violet (a common failing among many cameras I've tested). I also noticed slightly reduced saturation in the red tones in the outdoor house shot. Though its color performance falls a little short compared to previous C-series cameras I've tested, the C-720 still does a good job. I'd like to see a manual white balance adjustment however, which might eliminate the slight warm cast, and would almost certainly help it with incandescent lighting.
The C-720 performed well on the "laboratory" resolution test chart. It started showing artifacts in the test patterns at resolutions as low as 600 lines per picture height, but I found "strong detail" out to at least 1,000 lines. "Extinction" of the target patterns occurred at about 1,300 lines. There is a fair bit of softness in the extreme corners of the images though, which can combine with the modest chromatic aberration to produce very visible purple fringes around the edges of dark objects appearing against bright backgrounds in the corners of the frame.
The C-720's electronic viewfinder (EVF) proved very accurate at both wide angle and telephoto lens settings. At wide angle, I measured an approximate 99 percent frame accuracy.At telephoto, the viewfinder was very slightly loose, but very close to 100 percent frame accuracy. (Frankly, the coverage was probably exactly 100% for both zoom settings, the minor differences reflecting the margin of error in my measurements.) Given that I generally prefer LCD monitors to be as close to 100 percent accuracy as possible, the C-720 does an excellent job here. .
The C-720's full manual exposure control and maximum exposure time of eight seconds gives the camera great low-light shooting capabilities. At ISO 100, the camera captured bright, clear images with good color at light levels as low as 1/4 foot-candle (2.7 lux), though the target remained visible as low as 1/16 foot-candle (0.67 lux). At ISO 200, images were usable as low as1/8 foot-candle (1.3 lux), and as low as 1/16 foot-candle at ISO 400. I noticed that images still appeared slightly dim, even at the brightest light levels, but were still good enough for use.The camera's Noise Reduction system did a fairly good job of eliminating image noise, however, a few bright pixels of noise made it into all of the images (with the highest level at ISO 400). Typical city street lighting equates to about one foot-candle (11 lux), so the C-720 ought to do a good job with much darker shots.
The C-720 was about average in the macro category, capturing a slightly large minimum area of 3.93 x 2.95 inches (100 x 75 millimeters). Resolution was very high, with sharp, well-defined details in the dollar bill, coins, and brooch. Exposure was a little bright, however, and there was some barrel distortion from the wide-angle lens position. (There's also a little corner softness present.) The C-720's long lens barrel blocks the flash in the lower left corner of the frame when you're at the closest macro shooting distance, and flash power is much too bright overall. Bottom line, an average macro performer, and plan on using an external light source when you're really close.
Despite the slightly warm color cast in some images, the C-720 Ultra Zoom did pretty well during my testing. Given the extensive range of manual controls it offers, a manual white balance option would have made a lot of sense as well. Still, overall color and saturation was good, and the camera's low-light shooting abilities should be ample for most uses.
Conclusion
If you need to routinely deal with distant subjects, there's simply no substitute for a long-ratio zoom lens. With an 8x zoom and three megapixels of resolution, the aptly-named C-720 UltraZoom offers a very affordable and functional entry into the realm of long-telephoto digital photography. It snaps good pictures, with good color and tone, but it has a few limitations too, including greater than average "purple fringing" of dark objects against bright backgrounds, in the corners of the frame (a common long-zoom problem), and a somewhat sluggish shutter response. As my regular readers will know, I'm also no big fan of electronic viewfinders, because they're generally next to useless in dim lighting. Still, looking at the camera as a total package, it offers really excellent value in a long-zoom camera. There's plenty of resolution for sharp 8x10 prints, color and exposure are very good, and there's plenty of manual control available. With the focusing set to "landscape", it'll snap good pictures down to very low light levels, with very little image noise. All in all, a good buy in a long-zoom camera, particularly if you're on a limited budget. The predecessor C-700 UltraZoom was a very popular model, and I expect the C-720 UltraZoom will be as well.

Advanced praise for Steve Tompkins' Clay County Pastoral, forthcoming from Word Press:
"In his debut collection, Steve Tompkins assembles a vivid map of family legacy, war, PTSD, and childhood woven together with a zen wisdom that dots the poetic landscape. This amazing collection is filled with ferocious and tender moments that invite readers to get their hands dirty fishing the muddy rivers, to wander the pastoral fields of Missouri, and to sample the food toiled from the land. A powerful debut from a talented, emerging American poet."
Juan J. Morales
“Steve Tompkins begins his debut collection with a question for the heart: Are you willing to put your hand into the mouth of the unknown, ready and able to face the consequences of a vulnerable life? In this accomplished volume of poetry, Tompkins says yes to the ‘whiskerfish’ lurking in the dark pools of consciousness, a treasure that is ours to claim. With immense tenderness and intelligence, Tompkins crafts a collection within the poetic lineage of Robert Frost, Richard Hugo, and William Stafford – this is hard, stark, even haunting work, nevertheless suffused with musicality and pathos. His dialogues with the figure of Clayton Parker, notably his final elegy sequence, deserve to be set beside some of the best narrative poetry being written today.”
—David Keplinger
“What a first collection! With a richly descriptive eye and colloquial tone full of intensity and intellect, Steve Tompkins shows his empathy, both tough and tender, for the farming and working families in the South and Midwest by taking us to Clay County, a place where one finds ‘no ordinary living and dying going on around here.’ His poems are as consistent as moonlit nights following hard days, both fully thought-out and fully experienced, a smooth volume that moves with humor and sorrow over its landscape where ‘some dreams…just take a while to die.’ One can’t help but finish this book feeling a deeper connection to a much larger state of mind.”
—Robert King
“Like a Johnny Cash song, Steve Tompkins’ Clay County Pastoral is a piece of Americana that is rooted in the people and in the land. This amazing collection of poetry manages to transcend the philosophical through an everyday language—the language of real life. To experience these poems is to come away with a completely different perspective of the world in which we live, a perspective gained with help from the character of Clayton Parker, whose colloquial language and tremendous life-force help drive the energy of this incredible work. In this book the stories are magnificent, the images brilliant, the rhythms superb.”
—Tony Moffeit
“The poems in Steve Tompkins’ Clay County Pastoral know how to catch a reader's attention and keep it. In this accomplished collection, we find a fully-present poet at the height of his powers. I am grateful for this earthy, spirited work, unafraid to go ‘down deep in the muck’ and demonstrating that paying attention is a means of transcendence.”

The way i interpret what I think we are proposing with respect to GET and SOAP is an MEP that we might call a "message-poll" that uses a binding specific mechanism for a SOAP node to solicit a (SOAP?) message from another SOAP node (referenced by URI). I'm not at-all sure where the "non-SOAP" message comes in - but I think that probably just a difference in the way we (you and I) try to explain essentially the same thing. It's also plausible that the result of such a poll is not a SOAP message, but some 'ordinary' HTTP GET response with something else in it. In those circumstances, I don't think we have anything to say other than... it means whatever it would mean as an HTTP GET response. > >>. Ok...

That's Ok... my point (which is the one that follows) is that in such circumstances we cannot be describing the behaviour of the HTTP client - that already been done (elsewhere). It also not clear that the responding SOAP node can even tell that the client is *not* a SOAP node. >  Cheers, StuartReceived on Thursday, 30 May 2002 12:35:02 UTC

- 15 August 2013
- From the section Tayside and Central Scotland
A 15-year-old boy is in a critical condition after being hit by a car.
Police said the teenager was crossing the A977 at Balado, near Kinross, at about 18:45 on Wednesday when he was hit by a grey Volvo S40 travelling west, towards the Crook of Devon.
He was taken to the Royal Victoria Hospital, Kirkcaldy, where he was in a critical but stable condition.
Police have appealed for witnesses to contact them.In Naples, stumbling on to La Stanza del Gusto restaurant
I’ve largely considered Naples a necessary evil, a stop along the way to more desirable destinations. The city felt especially grimy on my most recent visit; the scene outside the central train station resembled a doomsday movie set, with people weaving shopping carts among stalled traffic and mountains of trash. I kept expecting Tom Cruise to zip by our taxi on a motorcycle.
Stuck overnight because of flight scheduling, we dutifully headed to the Archaeological Museum whose treasures of antiquity sadly get overshadowed by their derelict surroundings. From there, we wandered Old Town’s narrow streets past stalls selling religious tchotchkes and crumbling buildings so beautiful their neglect seems criminal.
Admittedly, Naples has a certain energy, a kind of living decay that both puts me on high alert and gives me a traveler’s high. The countless churches certainly leave a lasting impression, as do those famous Neopolitan pies. But it wasn’t prayer or pizza that saved the day. It was La Stanza del Gusto (Via Constantinopoli 100; 081401578), a cheese bar and restaurant not listed in our guidebook. Looking to change our son’s diaper, we stumbled upon this gem and had the meal of the trip.
Seated at a communal table in the colorful, ground-floor space, we devoured small plates of fried artichokes and homemade pasta — it was the kind of culinary epiphany tourists in Italy expect but don't always find. We didn’t make it upstairs but plan to return for the tasting menu next time. The Campanian cuisine is reason enough to book that cheaper ticket with a lay.Mother. Father. Always you wrestle inside me.
A truth that releases a waterfall of emotion. It is this energy that propels us through The Tree of Life. A voluptuous, bulging energy shaped and encouraged by sweeping camera movement, ultra wide lenses, lyrical blocking, the safe-harbor of Jessica Chastain’s face, and the vacillation in Hunter McCracken’s. These combine to create scenes that perfectly capture the rapturous feelings of childhood. Sensations evoked when light & dark entwine, and our instinctual knowledge that these things are the same.
And on how to approach the film:
A moment long enough for me to relax, and I was suddenly taken by a feeling of great tenderness and calm. I don’t completely understand why I felt this, but the inclusion of these CGI dinosaurs struck me as an particularly affectionate and loving decision. Terrence Malick believes in his audiences, and has faith that we also can believe. It’s the feeling of your mother brushing the hair off your forehead as she tells you a bedtime story. You protest because she’s changed a part of the usual tale, or it’s not the way you want it to be, but smiling, she says “Shhh shhh. Just listen.”
From the brilliant Kartina Richardson.Demoyn Nancy Negri

Home School (Age 5-8): Maple Syruping
March 21, 2017 @ 1:00 pm - 3:00 pm| $10/child (members save 10%)
Event Navigation
Join us for a seasonal favorite! Learn basic tree identification, try tools used by pioneers to “tap a tree,” taste the sap from maples and cook it down to syrup. Discover the science of sap flow in the tree and the boiling process. Through stories and historic artifacts, we will teach the history of maple syrup making from past to the present—and taste the final product!%)Is your offspring's educational experience a tale of frustration, struggle and criticism? Is it a story of meetings with teachers and trips to the principal's office? Do you cringe when the phone rings, praying it's not your child's teacher? Is your son on the verge of losing his motivation? Does your daughter engage in inappropriate behaviors to attract attention?
Frequently our children are locked into an educational system designed for a particular way of thinking with a very specific structure of learning. And this may be terrific for the majority of the class. But what about the children who are floundering - daydreaming or restless, failing or acting out? Each person has different intellectual attributes, scholastic abilities and different struggles. Perhaps your son or daughter has a different kind of mind, with skills and strengths that aren't rewarded in the traditional classroom.
Classroom learning requires sustained concentration, a sharp memory, comprehension of visual and audio stimuli, coherent expression of thoughts and ideas, problem solving, creative thinking and tremendous effort. And that's just for starters. None of these are uniformly and evenly distributed skills.
We must demonstrate our acceptance and love for our child at every available moment.
As parents, we need to begin by recognizing the prevalence of learning differences, accepting our children for who they are, focusing on their very real strengths, and understanding that it has NOTHING to do with intelligence, kindness or moral behavior.
We must demonstrate our acceptance and love for our child at every available moment. If they're struggling at school, then they're probably feeling discouraged and downhearted. They may feel inferior and worthless. Running away can sound very tempting. Home must be a place of refuge and understanding with no pressure or exhortations to change.
And we must be clear that this challenge is about our child's unique mission in the world and not us.
A friend of mine who has a severely handicapped son shared this idea with me. "What really got me past the pain", she suggested, "was to recognize that my son is not in the world to accomplish for me, or to carry out my dreams and wishes. He's just a child who deserves all the joy and happiness I can provide."
Proverbs teaches that we should "educate the child according to his ways" -- his (or her) ways -- not mine, not yours, not his friends, not their teachers. Sensitivity to individuality is the foundation of good teaching and good parenting. Since there are so many possible types of learning issues, not all get equal attention. But all equally indicate a need.
One of the most widely recognized learning challenges is ADD, Attention Deficit Disorder. Children who are unable to sit still, very easily distracted, restless and jumpy, and have poor impulse control may have ADD. These may be the adults on every community committee making enormous contributions to society, but in a classroom that requires silence and obedience…
Try this simple assignment. The next time you are at a family celebration or function take a good look at the other people sitting at your table during the second or third speech. Most of them will be sitting with their hands folded, looking respectfully at the speaker. Several will be fidgeting slightly. One person at your table, or the table next to you, will drive you to distraction if you watch him for any extended period. He will play with the silverware, fiddle with a pen, shift around in the chair, or simply walk out of the room. That adult was his teacher's nightmare 20 or 30 years ago.
Carefully observe the entire room and chances are you'll find several people with these tendencies. These restless people are very often the ones who contribute the most to our society. He may be the president of his shul, she may be the coordinator of an important communal organization. If you did not grow up with them, you would be shocked at what poor students they were in their youth. Of course, not all restless children have ADD. Educational testing is a crucial prerequisite. But recognizing the issue at stake and not blaming the child is the only road to progress. Look at your High School yearbook. In all likelihood, many of those who would have been voted "least likely to succeed" are today outstanding individuals - some in the spiritual realm, some in the business world, and others in their communal activities. They are successful today, not in spite of their difficulty in school, but rather, because of it. The qualities that we cherish in adults -- creativity, boldness, imagination, and boundless energy -- make for very poor students. Although not every restless child becomes a success story, it is helpful to be aware that despite the present difficulty, your child may very well have a reservoir of talent and ability that properly channeled, will produce an outstanding adult.

THANKS FOR THE CHIZUK
I read this article a while back in the American Jewish Monitor, clipped it then and read it many times since. It has given me much chizuk; my child is a normal, albeit very lively, child and the article made me feel that if I could just have the strength to make it through the child/teen years, we will be"h see much nachas as our child uses her abundant energy for great things. Thank you again.

Thank-you, & Help!!
Dear Rabbi,
How refreshing it was to read your article.
I've been saying the same things for the past 12 years!!!
And here I am again, in search for a school for my son.
My son has been in 5/6 schools for the past ten years.
His name is Jeremiah and he will be 17 on the 19th of Adar.
Doctor's have claimed that he is boarder-line Asperger's. He is very bright, intutive, and loves to 'tinker' with mechanical toys/objects (ie broken radios, anything with a motor!). He can sit and read for hours or tinker. He is on meds - which help him stay focused.
The reason why he's gone to so many schools is because I'm keen on him getting a Jewish education as well as a secular education. It is very hard to find a school fit for him.
He is determined to get his science highschool credits, for he hopes to go to med-school. Considering how bright he is, it is not impossible.
He does like to organize and re-organize. At times he can spend the whole morning just doing one task - to it's perfection!
Please, Rabbi if you have any ideas or need more information in order to assist me, please write back. If there is a school in Israel that may be suited for my son, all the better!!
Thank-you, and be well, Milcah

Very near and dear to my heart!
That restless dreamer, distracted, off in fantasy land, that was me, 11 years ago. How hard I struggled in school, just to get passing grades. But I'm a freelance writer and artist now, and I'm doing good. Educators and parents need to remember that imagination and distractedness aren't always signs of a bad student, they're signs of a creative individual who is trying to find ways to express themself. What a great article to share with us! I applaud you're topic, how very close to my heart!

Views: 231. Field of Invention
This invention relates to collision avoidance in a communication layer two protocol, and more specifically, to a collision avoidance mechanism suitable to networking, low processing power devices, connected through an Ethernet hub.
2. Discussion of Prior Art
In modern systems it is very common to find a set of individual devices, each one with its own functions, capable of sharing information with each other through some kind of communication media. A clear example of such systems comes from a computer network. A local computer network is defined as a group of personal computers geographically located in a house or building. It is called Local Area Network (LAN) and comprises a group of personal computers sharing information, such as files, services, etc. The most cost-effective solution to such shared network is the utilization of only one physical media for all nodes present on the network. In this scheme, every device has the same right to use the unique channel to communicate with other device(s). A mechanism included in every device must be responsible for sharing the communication channel in an efficient manner.
The most popular type of computer network uses the Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) algorithm. A group of standards called 802, published by the IEEE, use this algorithm on different types of physical media.
The CSMA/CD algorithm senses first the communication media to determine if any other device is using it to transmit its information. If the channel is free, transmission starts but the channel is still sensed. If corrupt data is detected (sent information is different from actual channel content), transmission is aborted and each device involved in such collision backs off for a random time before sending the information again. Even when useful channel time is wasted on a collision, this mechanism has proved to satisfy the needs of a network that must be scalable to a great number of devices, in the order of hundreds of personal computers.
One of the most used CSMA/CD network is the 10BaseT Ethernet standard, which is very similar to the IEEE 802.3 standard. The Ethernet standard defines the type of physical media along with its electrical and timing characteristics. It works at 10 Mbps with Manchester bit encoding. It also defines the Media Access Control (MAC) with the CSMA/CD algorithm. When a device wants to transmit information to another device, the MAC layer of each device handles the recognition of the destination address in order to accept or refuse such packet. Such address is called MAC address, because it identifies the device accessing the communication channel. The MAC address is a 6-bytes unique identification number present on each device compatible with the Ethernet standard.
All devices connected to a 10BaseT Ethernet network use a twisted pair cable called UTP (Unshielded Twisted Pair) cable. A segment of UTP cable comes from each personal computer and is attached to a central device, which is responsible to connect all computers with each other. Initially, such device was called Ethernet hub. As said earlier, the hub takes any information coming from one of its connections and sends it to all other computers attached to it. It works as a repeater. Another device, called Ethernet switch, takes a step further and each connected computer is treated as an independent port, so information sent from one port to another doesn't have to be repeated to every other computer. It is directly sent from origin to destination port. Switches increase the performance, allowing a greater number of connected devices, but the cost is higher compared to a hub.
Due to its extended use, Ethernet LANs have not been limited to personal computers. Several devices used in industrial control and automation use this standard as the basis of communication network. It is also used in building and home automation, facilitating the merging of data computer networks and control networks. Having control devices attached to Ethernet networks makes it possible to perform remote configuration from a personal computer, reducing operational costs. It also allows the use of the personal computer as the monitoring station for the automation control network.
In order to make such control device interoperable with a personal computer, the communication protocol used by the computer must be present into the control device also. The most common protocol used by personal computers is the TCP/IP (Transfer Control Protocol/Internet Protocol). The IP protocol works at a lower level and is responsible for defining the logic address of each computer. That address is called the IP address, and each computer present on the same LAN must have different IP addresses. TCP protocol handles the integrity of the information and establishment of connections to transfer information between two devices present on the network in a reliable context. It is capable of fragmenting the information to make it more suitable for transmission over Ethernet networks. It also handles reordering of all pieces of incoming data and guarantees the correct arrival of all sent information. The TCP protocol is connection-oriented. A connection-oriented protocol has to ask for a connection to be opened. After the destination device accepts the connection petition, data transfer takes place, and finally the connection is closed by either of the two devices.
Another common protocol is the UDP/IP (User Datagram Protocol/Internet Protocol). Contrary to TCP, UDP protocol doesn't provide any reliability and it doesn't use any connection mechanism. It is called a message-oriented protocol, since each data packet goes from source to destination without any open-accept-transfer-close process.
As was stated before, the merging of a data network with a control network can be made only if both the personal computer and the control device handle the same communication protocol. In home automation specifically, low cost is one of the primary requirements for control devices. Such devices must be simple enough to keep cost down. That simplicity is achieved by using low processing power microcomputers, or most often, low processing power microcontrollers. This invention considers a low processing power microcontroller working at 8-bits, with 512 bytes (or less) of RAM registers and 8 k bytes (or less) of effective program memory. From this point and on the term microcontroller alone will be used as a reference to low processing power microcontrollers.
The TCP protocol is a very memory-demanding protocol, making difficult its implementation in a microcontroller. The UDP protocol instead requires much less memory resources, so its implementation in a microcontroller is easier.
Since home automation devices share the same Ethernet network with personal computers, they should behave as another connected computer in order to be recognized by them. The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), defined on the public document RFC2131 and published by the Network Working Group, was created for a personal computer attached to a network to obtain automatically its IP address. Even when this protocol works with the UDP protocol, it requires sending and receiving UDP packets more than 100 bytes long. Some microcontrollers don't contain enough RAM registers to cover this requirement.
With such limitations, control devices can't be considered as personal computers also, even when they are attached to the same LAN.
Thus, there is the need for a specialized and simple mechanism with low memory and protocol requirements (UDP protocol, with data packets from 16 up to 64 bytes long), capable of handling network management functions, as IP address assignment, presence detection or any other function involving all connected control devices.
In accordance to these characteristics, a control network manager installed on a computer could use UDP broadcasting messaging to communicate with every control device. If a given broadcast message generates a response from each control device, a problem arises since all of them would try to respond at the same time. As was stated before, the Ethernet standard considers a back-off algorithm to handle network collisions, but in case of having 32 (which could be real numbers for a home automation systems) control devices, collisions would still occur on every retry, and the back-off algorithm would fail.
This multiple collision condition only occurs when Ethernet hubs are used, because they work as repeaters. Ethernet switches can handle such situation avoiding multiple collisions.
However, home automation is very likely to see hubs instead of switches, since their cost is considerably lower and the number of devices attached would rarely be more than 32 or 64. This invention to provides a simple mechanism to avoid multiple collisions occurring in an Ethernet network using hubs, in accordance to home automation control devices with limited processing power.
This invention discloses a method for collision avoidance in Ethernet networks, such as home automation networks, with both personal computers and control devices attached to it. Ethernet hubs are considered as the type of device used to create the Ethernet network.
When a network management message is sent as a broadcast information from one personal computer to all control devices, they will generate a delayed response to the sender computer. Such delay is generated on each control device in accordance to its own MAC address. It will guarantee different delay times on all attached control devices.
The minimal time interval between two consecutive MAC addresses and the maximum possible delay time are estimated from the maximum number of expected devices attached to the hub(s).
Accordingly, several objects and advantages of the present invention are:
Other objects and advantages of this invention will become apparent from a consideration of the ensuing description and drawings.
FIG. 1 Ethernet network connecting a personal computer and control devices.
Let there be an Ethernet installed in a residential infrastructure or a small building. Hubs are used to connect all Ethernet-compliant devices. The Ethernet network is used at the same time as a data network for personal computers and as a control network for home automation devices.
Control devices are considered as low cost, low processing power equipment, capable of handling the 10BaseT Ethernet standard for UTP cable, along with the connectionless UDP/IP protocol to communicate with both personal computers and other control devices.
A computer attached to the network executes all control network management functions applicable to all control devices. Management functions can be sent either as a point-to-point UDP message or as a broadcast UDP message. Broadcast messaging will be the point of discussion for this invention.
Given a set of broadcast messages sent by a computer and a group of control devices capable of receiving and decoding such messages. All control devices finally generate back a response to the origin computer. Due to the use of Ethernet hub(s), multiple initial collisions of response messages are avoided by including unique, deterministic delays generated in each control device. FIG. 1 represents an Ethernet network comprising a hub 110 connecting a personal computer 112 with control devices 114 a, 114 b and 114 n. The suffix n is an indication that a generic number of control devices can be connected on the hub.
A hypothetical broadcast UDP/IP message 116, called Look-for-nodes is sent by the computer. As its name suggests, this network management message is sent to detect the presence of any control device. The corresponding response must include, for example, the actual IP address. All control devices 114 a, 114 b and 114 n receive the UDP/IP message and must send back their response.
As was said before, every Ethernet-compliant device contains a 6-byte unique identification number called MAC address. The MAC can be separated in two parts: The three least significant bytes are called Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI) and they identify the manufacturer of the device; the upper three bytes are used by the manufacturer to produce any kinds of 802-compliant devices. In the preferred embodiment of the invention, each control device must use the fourth byte (least significant byte of manufacturer's set of numbers) of its own MAC address to start a decreasing counter called TOUT_CTR. When the TOUT_CTR reaches zero, the response is sent to the origin computer. For a 10BaseT network, and considering up to 256 nodes, each count for de TOUT_CTR must last between 600 microseconds and 1 millisecond. It keeps an adequate minimum time spacing between consecutive MAC addresses (on the LSByte only) and also maintain a low maximum-worst case delay (256 milliseconds for the 1 millisecond spacing). Using one byte as the initial counter value allows 256 different delays, allowing a maximum of 256 control devices sharing the same Ethernet network. This number is enough for home automation solutions. Even more, Ethernet networks connected through hubs usually don't have more than 64 nodes connected to it.
In our example, if the least significant byte of the MAC address in control device 114 a is lower than 114 b's, and this last lower than 114 n's, a response 118 a will come first, followed by a response 118 b, and this one followed by a response 118 n. In another embodiment, not only the fourth byte of the MAC address is used, but up to all three upper bytes could be considered for a bigger TOUT_CTR. The preferred embodiment considers just one byte to keep a low resource-demanding profile. As was said before, using one byte would allow 256 different delays, so the chances to have two control devices with the same TOUT_CTR (equal fourth byte in the MAC address) are higher than having a TOUT_CTR represented by two or three bytes. It must be noticed that all three bytes would be an extreme case (there would exist more than 16 million of different TOUT_COUNTERS), because the worst wait case would be then in the order dozens of minutes! Using up to two bytes allows a maximum of 65536 different counts (chances of equal TOUT_CTR are almost zero), with a bearable one-minute delay for the worst wait case.
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, each broadcast message sent from computer 112 contains an adjustment parameter called CTR_ADJ. The CTR_ADJ can vary from 0 up to 255 and contains an exact or approximate number of actual nodes connected to the network. This information is considered to create a more or less accurate decreasing count to the TOUT_CTR. For Example, if the CTR_ADJ has a value of 10, then the full eight bit counter in TOUT_CTR is not necessary, and the four least significant bits are enough (four bits would allow 16 control nodes). This mechanism would increase the total response time. This procedure can be used as long as the control devices contain consecutive MAC addresses adjusted to the binary value contained in CTR_ADJ. If that is not the case, another simpler embodiment ignores the CTR_ADJ parameter and the full 8-bit counter TOUT_CTR is always used, regardless of the number of estimated nodes.
As the reader can see, the collision avoidance mechanism shown here represents a simple solution for low processing power control devices, specific to in home automation systems.
Creating unique, delayed responses on each control device in response to a broadcast network management message, the occurrence of initial multiple collisions in an Ethernet hub is avoided. Since the unique MAC address contained on each Ethernet-compliant device is used as the initial timeout count, each delay will be different in a block of 256 devices (sufficient for home automation systems). With this mechanism, simple network management functions can be created to handle low cost control devices attached to an Ethernet network. A low computation time and low memory resource demanding protocol, like the UDP/IP protocol, along with short messages (16, 32 or 64 bytes long), will be enough to establish a communication between control devices and a personal computer.
While our above description contains many specificities, these should not be construed as limitations to the scope of the invention, but rather as an exemplification of one preferred embodiment thereof. Obviously, modifications and alterations will occur to others upon a reading and understanding of this specification such as, for example, creating a parameter that could control the time duration of each TOUT_CTR count.
The description above is intended, however, to include all such modifications and alterations insofar as they come within the scope of the appended claims or the equivalents thereof.Every year towards the end of May, there is a certain excitement that fills the air of American culture. We know it as... the end of school for the summer. It is highlighted by the Memorial Day weekend. (Never mind it's not what the weekend is about, but we'll get to that in another post, on Monday)
Even in the face of this newly rediscovered annual freedom festival, there were always a few unlucky or foolish souls who made piss poor decisions that cost them their lives. I knew of a few people in my younger days that fit this bill. Just I am sure others know of some more recently.
In the grand scope of things, let's just say there will always be those select few who will feel invincible. This song called, Then Came The Last Days Of May tells the story of three such folly-laden young men:
Invincibility is overrated, immortality in this world is non-existent. The graveyards hold many who miscalculated and the world has many among us today, who skated a visit from the Grim Reaper.
If nothing else we can use both kinds of people as examples, bad and good. The rock world is no exception and is full of late musicians and singers who failed to recognize the folly of walking a tight rope without a balance beam.
I sense that Morrison might have sensed his own mortality in this all-time classic:
Be careful out there this weekend. Be Safe.
Relax and celebrate with passion. But please do it responsibly.

I'm so naive I never thought of the meaning of RIDERS ON THE STORM as you've portrayed it but I see your point. While living in Paris, there were two graves I knew I particularly wanted to see...Chopin and Morrison. Morrison's been very badly vandalized (I guess it's more about wanting a piece of him than wanting the grave site to look bad)..Chopin ALWAYS has fresh flowers people still bring..
that has to be one of the best intros of any song...always wonderful keyboard from the DOORS..LIGHT MY FIRE's is dynamite, isn't it? In my band, I had to play that and I always felt deficient, though I usually got the notes.
Memorial Day isn't only about soldiers, is it......memories are memories and too many kids in our memories lost their lives to drugs...
Thanks, LA.

As a fan of music, I have always thought so too. It's nice to hear someone in the business validate what I have always felt to be true.
The song always had an eerie feel to it, probably because I first heard it after his death. But I will say that if anyone had the opportunity and ability to fake his own death, it would have been him.By CS ON February 11, 2009 Paramount Pictures announced today that a third trailer for J.J.

To compile the graph drawing application, type make dg in the SYMPHONY root directory. The user routines in the file user_dg.c can be filled in, but it is not necessary to fill anything in for basic applications.
After compiling dg, the user must write some subroutines that communicate with dg and cause the graph to be drawn. Regrettably, this is currently a little more complicated than it needs to be and is not well documented. However, by looking at the sample application, it should be possible to see how it is done. To enable graph drawing, put the line do_draw_graph 1 into the parameter file or use the -d command line option. It can be difficult to get IGD to work. If you are interested in using it and cannot get it to work, feel free to contact me.
Ted RalphsTed RalphsHand quilting
This was my first handquilting project
I don't know the name of it but it was a pillow that was the project for a beginner's class my aunt was teaching at the quilting store. I went on to start a blanket for my son that I have to finish piecing together. I just finished the top a few days ago.
My first hand knitting project was a baby quilt many years ago on a frame. Now, I use a different method where you don't have to frame the quilt. Sharon Schamber has videos that show how to hand quilt and how to just baste the quilt before working on it. I haven't tried a full size quilt since I learned this new method, but I love how the one I posted on your other post turned out. BTW, the best thing I learned was to use a wool bat (they actually have them where they are washable now and don't shrink a ton). I also use a smaller size (finer) needle so it allows me to do the rocking motion and load stitches better.
Hand quilting is fun.It gives you the freedom to take it around.I would start with a crazey quilt.I made a number of them.You can be very creative with material and colors. Good luck.
A quillow or lap quilt, and using a large embroidery hoop as a lap frame. And don't worry about the stitch to inch ratio, just work on getting the stitches even. I was always told the Amish get 12 stitches to the inch, and always leave a mistake in their work, to show respect for knowing that only God does perfect work. Happy stitching,
ps. I got 3-4 stitches/inch when I tried hand quilting, so I am a happy machine quilter. :-)

Some have dealt with practice-threatening litigation, organisational restructure and personnel changes, following very good times.
But few have done it under the radar quite like Top 30 firm Chantrey Vellacott DFK.
Further reading
Thankfully, managing partner Mike Tovey is open and reflective as he takes Accountancy Age through his 11-year tenure.
"Over the years we've been a quiet, rather introspective, firm," he states in a clear, but definite, London lilt.
The firm faced a hiatus from its low-key offering, when a dispute with a client spilled out onto the business pages in 2006.
Client Convergence Group sued the firm for what it alleged was bad advice that led to the telco provider losing a $100m (£58.4m) contract. The claim against Chantrey Vellacott spiralled up to £150m. A court case, scheduled for five months, was ended after four weeks when the judge threw the case out.
It was a "crazy thing" that dragged on, in total, for six years, says Tovey. The firm had allowed the client to build up unpaid fees and, when chased, Convergence counter-claimed for "an astronomical number".
"Thank goodness our PI cover and insurers were very robust in our defence," he adds.
With a proverbial sword hanging over the practice, a people-based business can fold very quickly. But it was confident it would win out, explains Tovey, and the firm was ready to stand up to the claim. But financially it was a limited victory, with the firm's insurers picking up the tab after Convergence entered administration.
View from the outside
While moving towards an LLP structure had also been on Tovey's mind - a move that limits individual members' liability - that was a mere step towards much bigger changes. An interview with a potential new member of the firm raised his eyebrows. They were surprised at his description of what a good firm he worked in.
"We had some pretty interesting clients, doing high-quality work, but it wasn't in the big public world - it was private client, low-profile. As a long-established firm we accrued those type of clients...we never really felt the need to mix it up out in the market."
This, alongside the culture of the firm, was going to lead it on a bad path. "We traded on our past glories for rather too long. The firm was described to me as a ‘sleeping giant' - an insult and a compliment at the same time but it resonated with me".
With client attrition and replacement previously a platform of strength, it was now a weakness. The practice couldn't rely on word of mouth and referrals to make up the lost ground.
"We've always done high quality work but were placing too much reliance on what we already had, we weren't going into the market to find new opportunities."
Results during the early noughties weren't up to scratch, and "a few dramatic things" needed to be done.
Mandate for change
While his election process in 2003 was "nerve-wracking", he came out the other side with much confidence, as he had huge support for his change agenda.
"There was that spirit, ‘let's really show ourselves what we can achieve'."
The practice went back to basics. Its financing was put on a much more stable footing, and profit was put to the fore. New profit-sharing arrangements were agreed, while the management of the firm was made more transparent.
Subsequently, some people fitted with the new regime, and some didn't. "You can't let anyone hold the business back and if they can't or won't adapt to the new plans, they really have to move on and some did."
But Tovey is confident that not only did people leave in in the "right way", but that these decisions were the correct ones, "that we'd made the right decisions for the future of the firm". "As far as we could we dealt with difficult personnel issues as generously and with as much humanity as we could. The most value in any business dealing is being fair."
And did the firm shrink as a result? Yes, says Tovey, but profits climbed between 2003 and 2008, with new business driving the bottom line.
Crucially, Chantrey Vellacott looked to redefine its key markets.
Where its longstanding institutional clients and not-for-profits had been a key tranche of its work, they were in a routine of audit tendering, and the firm wasn't winning clients of an equivalent quality. Instead it was having more success in the owner-managed business space.
This served the practice well during that period, until the financial crisis. "Then the world changed," says Tovey.
Dissipating fees
At first the firm ticked along fine, but Tovey holds his hands up to admitting that it didn't foresee the funding and finance crisis the owner-managed-business (OMB) market would suffer. The one-off consulting and corporate finance fees disappeared. "That cost us pretty dear in 2009 and 2010. It became a matter of hunkering down and supporting each other."
Partner profits fell, but it managed to hold onto its top performers. "You really get to understand, under pressure, the real quality of the people you've got."
Cost-cutting, and taking on any work put in front of them, saw them muddle on. But a strategic plan was borne during a partner conference in late 2011. Tovey set out that, unless the firm was growing, it would fail to attract key people, lose the ones it had and then lose its independence.
"You either grow, or get out of the game - that's all there is. You can reduce costs and kid yourself, but then you cut into muscle."
Another meeting was organised, this time with key personnel who understood and would implement a business development plan.
The ‘special meeting' was a watershed for Chantrey Vellacott, outlining the introduction of a sales culture into the business although, crucially, only for those that could sell. "Some firms try and force everybody to be the same - unless you play to people's strengths you'll never get the best out of them," Tovey explains.
The practice also set out to be more scientific about sales. More than 50% of fee income came from OMBs and their owners, while another huge chunk came from member organisations, alongside the small-listed company market.
The firm then set out to broaden the services provided to each client, to "break down the silos".
"We challenge partners to have more than one partner engaged with a client...three with bigger clients."
The firm then combined its service line and sector knowledge with its geographical spread, to really understand its offering and fill gaps where required.
Achieving best growth through acquisition is to bolt on, Tovey points out, rather than enter into a completely new location. "If you've got a location you can bolster that makes much more sense [financially] than a new location, as you'd enter a market you don't necessarily understand."
Better defined
So Chantrey Vellacott now focuses on fewer areas - the things it's good at, where it makes money, and has critical mass. Following a more corporate model, work is allocated where it's best equipped to be undertaken, so payroll will be served through its Thames Valley office, for example. "We're one profit-sharing firm," he points out.
The way in which the firm projects itself to the world has also moved on in the last ten years - for a start, it has a much smarter and professional website than most of its peers, and has incorporated its new branding in the process.
"We need to offer our best face, the positives."
And so the firm, which can trace its roots back to 1788, is set up better for the future.
"Going through those bad times has really helped us focus on what we're good at and where we need to focus our resources...it's been cleansing in a way," says Tovey. "I look at our business and people and say, it's probably as good as it's ever been."

SANDY RELIEF: Students at Northampton High School will kick off school relief efforts for survivors of Superstorm Sandy with a blood drive Friday from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. at the high school on Elm Street.
Participants can donate blood for those in need in the New York City area and other parts of the East Coast affected by the massive storm that hit late last month.
Senior Alex Rifken, who is this year’s student representative on the Northampton School Committee, reported last week that students will be meeting in their regular small group advisories Friday to come up with other ways to assist storm victims. Ideas include a collection drive for food, batteries, clothing and other supplies.
“We see what’s happening on the news and a lot of us want to help,” said Rifken, who shares a seat on the school board with NHS classmate Sarah Moss-Horwitz.
“We don’t want this to just be an NHS thing,” he added. “We want the community involved.”
For details about Friday’s blood drive, call the high school at 587-1344.

I'm not sure why my first version never made it to the list, so here it
goes again:
I want the first new version of the website to be as it was when the
reported missing docs were there, i.e. the old navigation structure but
with the small changes I've done in the portal block and of course the
updated content of the pages currently in Daisy.
So, if you can run the Daisy-to-Forrest export, can you use the old
navigation structure documents or should I be rewriting these in Daisy?
Note: I have left files that haven't been changed in SVN since Bruno's
import in Daisy, in the "legacydocs" collection. Only after
reviewing/updating them do I move the to the "documentation" collection,
so the export should include the "legacydocs" collection as well as the
"documentation" collection, at least for now.
Bye, Helmatag:blogger.com,1999:blog-44088428305905289312015-05-22T01:39:35.718+05:30The Last Word (Beta)Blogger nerdery!Aditya applications aren't that social, or useful<p>It’s been just about more than a year (if I’m correct) since the release of F8, Facebook’s platform for developers to create ‘social’ applications which Facebook users can add to their profiles and make merry. Just about more than a year later, a browse through the top 10 applications (ranked by use) shows the problem. Well, not so much of a problem; considering there is nothing wrong, but more of a worry. Atleast for me.</p> <p><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href=""><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5142023698883891042" /></a></p> <p>You see it? No?</p> <h4>Utterly useless</h4> <p>Not more than 2% of the applications have any ‘use’ value. The only part of Facebook ‘from’ Facebook they use is the userbase. Not their details. Them. These applications are trying to come up with any little excuse to make people invite more people to use them. Take ‘SuperWall’ or ‘FunWall’ for example.</p> <p>These two applications do ‘nothing’ more than what the native Facebook Wall does not. The only difference? There is no difference! It’s just that people don’t know that their wall can do all those things, and more. And yet, they are top of the list, ranks one and two respectively.</p> <h4>What makes them tick</h4> <p>It seems people flock towards applications that are ‘fun’. Not necessarily useful. Application makers<span class='note'>I’ll not call them developers, since they’re just coding; not really developing anything</span> seem to understand this, and are resorting to making their applications dumber, and dumber so that it appeals to the common person. I can give you proof with my very own applications here.</p> <p>I have three:</p> <ol> <li><strong>So much to do!</strong>: This is a simple to-do list tracking application, which allows you to make lists, and show it those lists on your profile.</li> <li><strong>Photos2RSS</strong>: This allows you to get photos from anywhere in Facebook as feed (RSS/JSON), which can be further used anywhere feeds can be used.</li> <li><strong>Thought for the day</strong>: Another simple application to show a ‘thought’ or a quote on your profile. It also lets you tag quotes as favourites, and share them with friends.</li> </ol> <p>Take a quick guess as to the order of ranks based on number of users of those applications. Answer’s at the end of the post.</p> <p>So, to come back to the point I was making. I don’t know what Zuckerberg’s main motive was to creating the platform, and allowing people to develop applications on it. Maybe this ‘was’ what he wanted. Maybe it isn’t. But on thing is for sure. This defininitely undermines the genius behind the technical proficiency of F8. I can only begin to imagine the kind of work that has gone into it, and the amount of effort that goes into it everyday for maintainence and cleanup. The use it has been put to till date, doesn’t even begin to do justice to it.</p> <p>Sure, it got more users to Facebook. It added value to your profile, and increased the worth of every user. But from a broader perspective, it hasn’t added ‘anything’ at all to Facebook in itself. There is no application which will make people join Facebook, because it’s true potential is only visible when you use it on the social level.</p> <p>I’m currently making another application. I’ll be all hush hush about it until I’m ready to release it. It only grazes the ideas I’ve touched here, because honestly, it ‘will’ take some serious brain racking to be able to come up with a concept like that. If someone can, it should be worthy of a job at Facebook itself.</p> <p>Eitherways, valued at $15 billion plus, Facebook will make him a rich guy ;)</p> <h4>The answer</h4> <p>As far as the answer to the question in the post goes, it’s:</p> <ol> <li>Thought for the day</li> <li>So much to-do!</li> <li>Photos2RSS</li> </ol> <p>What did you think? The geek app will have most users? Phsshh… You obviously didn’t read the post properly :P</p>Aditya: A new look for Google<p>All those who are getting a little tired of the lack of things on Google’s pages raise your hands! Now now, c’mon! I know you want to, don’t be shy.</p> <p>I am quite tired of it to be very honest. Seeing pages like <a href="">Yahoo</a>'s new homepage, or <a href="">Live.com<<span class="note">In all fairness, I got sick of Bloglines’ look as well. I opted for the tons better looking, and modestly functional Netvibes over an obvious superior, but downright ugly Bloglines and GReader</span>, and Google.com for my searches after Firefox got it’s own version of the Google.com search page.</p> <h4>A little overdone</h4>  <a href="">Digg</a>). I think this signature Google look has kind of outlived it’s glory.</p> <p>A look which got 3001 (including mine) <a href="">diggs</a> is this one, by <a href="">Andy Rutledge</a>:</p> <p><a href=""><img src=</a></p> <p.</p> <h4>Not enough</h4> <p>There have been silent touches being added to different services, to make them a little more aesthetically pleasing. Like the recent new look of <a href="">Google Groups</a>, and gentle additions to the Google Homepage<span class="note">They added (wow!) tabs</span>. But this is not enough. They really need to get their pants up and start to make some serious design decisions. Blogger is the only Google service which looks good. I thought the <a href="">hiring of Douglas Bowman</a> would open the doors to some much needed visual changes, but it’s been almost a year, and I’m still waiting.</p> <p>It would be a valid argument if one asked ‘Why fix something which is not broken?’. I’d answer that with the fact that a redesign <em>will</em>.</p> <p>It <em>is</em> about time, don’t you think?</p>Aditya doesn't suck! Not with time atleast...<p>I’m sure everyone by now has read the infamous <a href="">Vista sucks…</a> article. I don’t know if it was a deliberate attempt at trying to catch information, or they really believe what they wrote<span class='note'>By the looks of the explanations, looks like the latter is true</span>, but I really don’t think putting Vista 10th on the list of worst things —- and not even of 2007, but all time —- is the right thing. We know Microsoft got <em>a lot</em> of things wrong, but Vista surely deserve’s better.</p> <h4>Personal experience</h4> <p <em>are</em> <em>very<.</p> <p.</p> <h4>So why doesn’t it suck?</h4> <p<span class='note'>Which I think is because it has understood over a month the applications I use the most, and loads them up in the cache everytime it finds the space.</span>.

And once you do, you’ll see it isn’t ‘all’ that bad :)</p>Aditya to work for Facebook?<p>Justin Rosenstein had this to say when he was leaving Google for Facebook (June 8th, 2007)</p> <blockquote> <p>A couple of months ago, after three years as a Google product manager, I decided to leave for Facebook. I am writing this note to spread Good News to all the friends I haven't already overwhelmed with my enthusiasm: Facebook really is That company.</p> <p.</p> <p.</p> </blockquote> <p>It wasn't very long back that Google was voted the <a href="">best place to work for</a>, and I wouldn't argue with that. Google has been coming up with innovative new ideas, products and things that us geeks will be able to appreciate. Their stock prices have been rising (valued at $750+ at last check), and according to <a href="">this video</a>, it's a "really" nice place! Putting all those things together, it's not really rocket science to see how amazing it would be work for the company.</p> <p>Or would it?</p> <p><a href="">Techcrunch</a> <em>new</em>.</p> <p>But by the by, I won't mind a job at Facebook <em>or</em> Google ;)</p>Aditya whole 'online office' thing<p>Sometime between yesterday and today, Sabeer Bhatia (creator of Hotmail) released <a href="">Live Documents</a>; a service exclusively for Microsoft Office, which allows you to do all the things you can with Google’s and Zoho’s applications, but now with Office. Personally, I feel like this is the tagging thing all over again!</p> <p<span class="note">Or by the looks of it, Office 2008 for the Mac</span>. In both cases, you’re offline because it’s faster and you have many more features than a web counterpart.</p> <p>But most importantly, there is nothing new that these services have to offer, except for the technology they use, which only increases their speed and to a very small degree, what they can do. Google brought in AJAX, and Live Documents is bringing in Flex.</p> <p ...</p> <p>It'd do us all good if we got more consumable services which have scope to grow. But as of now, I’m not even bothering applying for an invitation. Let’s see if I’m wrong on this ....</p>Aditya Elements I like, and one's I don't<p>GUI (Graphical User Interface) is such an integral part of our computing lives, I really doubt we stop and analyze the separate elements that make it what it is –– easy and intuitive to use. It has evolved over years, suggestions and loads of empty coffee cups. It’s one problem designers try to solve always, but no matter what they do, there is a part of it which can always be improved. So here’s my little list of the things I like, and don’t like in user interfaces.</p> <h4>One's I like</h4> <ul> <li><p><strong>Check/Radio box</strong>: The simplest element. I think it was a natural decider to use this for lists, which would let you select multiple options, or only one<span class="note">Not many people know, but the difference between the two ‘is’ how they allow you to handle options marking.</span>. I’d really like to see them make checking off more intuitive (shift+first+last to select all in between).</p> </li> <li><p><strong>Tooltips</strong>: Help without asking for it. I feel very disoriented whenever I don’t know what a button does, and even moreso when the little help box doesn’t popup telling me what it does. This is partly the reason I love Office 2007, where every button on the Ribbon has a briefly detailed explanation of what it does.</p> </li> <li><p><strong>Ribbon</strong>: This is one of the newest elements, present in Microsoft Office ‘07. It’s probably the perfect and complete alternative to the menu bar. Every option is categorized under one tab, and similar options are grouped into sections. Every button has explanatory tooltips, and they do a very nice glowy thing when you mouse over, highlighting the selected section as well as button. Looks like Microsoft got something right :P</p> </li> <li><p><strong>Pie Menu</strong>: Last, but my most favourite. This one takes some getting used to, but once you do, it gets annoying when you don’t have it somewhere. The perfect example of this is mouse gestures in Firefox. All it takes it a click, and movement; but movement which is very intuitive (like left for back). I’d love to see this in operating systems, because it’ll be a huge navigation boost! </p></li> </ul> <h4>One's I don't!</h4> <ul> <li><p><strong>Menu bar</strong>: I won’t complain about this too much. With the onset of ‘Ribbon’, we can now start to do without the menu bar. Although, this is a better option when conserving screen estate. A retractable Ribbon seems the way to go :)</p> </li> <li><p><strong>Heads Up Display (HUD)</strong>: This is more of a ‘focus on few things’ kinda thing. An HUD is supposed to be unobtrusive to the ‘bigger’ picture, but the moment all those extra stuff start popping up, you can’t not be distracted by them. That’s one of the reasons research is on to come up with a better way of relaying information to pilots through their visors.</p> </li> <li><p><strong>Sidebar</strong>: This my most unliked element. Having something on the edge of your screen constantly is irritating. Dashboard is a ‘much’ better implementation, although it’d be nice if you could keep ‘some’ widgets always visible. Retractable drawers are also a type of Sidebar, but atleast they’re retractable :) </p></li> </ul> <p>So, there you have it! These elements are a part of our OS, and now with the onset of Web 2.0, most of them are being adapted for use on the web to make things snappy and more OS like. I’d love to see an alternative to sidebars, especially on blogs. It’d just make things a little more interesting ;)</p> <p>I haven’t touched on UI elements like modal dialogues, throbbers etc., but they are more of symbolic and rare use elements –– used to signify something or alert people of something. They’re important, no matter how irritating they might get. There’s a nice article from Alex Faaborg about his tussle with going modal or using normal dialogue boxes for Firefox, but it kinda answers the basic question (<a href=")">Would you Like to Redesign ...</a>)</p> <p>What elements do you like? And what do you don't?</p>Aditya return!<p>I know my dear and beloved blog has been neglected for a ‘very’ long time, but that has mostly been because of college, and me being a little lazy :P I got caught up in a lot of different things at the same time, and I couldn’t do them all :P But now another semester is coming to an end, so I see some free times, and I plan to make the most of it. </p> <p>There ‘are’ a lot of things that I’ve been wanting to share with all you guys, and going by my latest feed readership, most of you have hung around! Thanks a lot :) I hope to not disappoint ;)</p> <p>So a quick update about my <a href="" rel="ext">Blogger keep current date/time on post</a> script; I’ve fixed it. I think Improbulus sent me a mail a long time back, but thanks to the reasons I’ve mentioned above, I wasn’t able to reply or respond. I got around fixing it this time, and it’s working wonderfully again :)</p> <p>So, here’s to another return! :)</p>Aditya downtime, iPhone and my stinkin' exams<p>Facebook went down today for a couple of hours, citing ‘maintainence’ as the reason. They were down for a couple of ours for ‘me’. I don’t know about the others, since it said ‘your account is not available’.</p> <p.</p> <p>Platform has been hugely successful, and you can begin to see a visionary in Zuckerberg. Even though any data regarding the application itself (users, referrals, how many adds per hour etc.) aren’t available<span class='note'>There are some applications which scrape this data out of Facebook, but that’s against Facebook TOS (scraping), so I don’t think they’ll be around for too long.</span>, the data and integration options make up for it pretty well :)</p> <h4>iPhone!!</h4>  <a href="">increased activity</a> thanks to the people waiting in line busy micro–blogging to get their experience out. The <a href="">iLoser</a> reached celebrity stardom for all the wrong reasons … with people howling for him to thrown out. But he <a href="">maintained his place</a>.</p> <p.</p> <p <a href="">not complaining</a>! :)</p> <h4>Exams, exams! :(</h4> <p.</p> <p>So! Here’s to a great iPhone for all those who have it, and who’re going to buy it! And I shall be back to blogging full time very, ‘very’ soon! :D</p>Aditya shout out to Search Suggest users<p>It’s been quite a while since I released my <a href="">Search Suggestions</a> hack. Since then, I’ve seen the number of hashes being created for authorization increase steadily, which means people “are” using it. What I haven’t seen increase, is the number of search “terms” being added to my database.</p> <p>This can mean one of two things:</p> <ol> <li><p>You have implemented the hack, but have botched up something in the implementation which is preventing search terms from being added to your account.</p> </li> <li><p>You have “not” implemented my hack, and are just sitting pretty with a hash code in my database. </p></li> </ol> <p>For the first case, if you need help implementing the hack properly, please let me know. I’ll be more than willing to have a look at your code and see where things are being messed up. We all want the suggestions to come up nice and pretty now, don’t we? :)</p> <p>For the second case, well … if you don’t want to use it, fair enough. Just let me know your passcodes (which you used to get your hashes) so that I can remove them from the database, to prevent them from eating up space :)</p> <p>Chow!</p>Aditya small success!<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href=""><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5075908884909891394" /></a> <p>Checking today (‘today’ being the second day of this <a href="" rel="ext">application</a> :)</p> <p>So, now I’m going to have a look at the whole Facebook development scenario:</p> <h4>F8 Platform</h4> <p.</p> <p>Facebook is one of the first APIs (that I’ve seen in my short stint with webdev) that offers direct access to their SQL tables. Ofcourse, they call it <abbr title="Facebook Query Language">FQL</abbr>, but the outcome is the same. You select columns, where certain conditions are matched and validated, from some tables. This not only saves time, but reduces server load, since you’re going to the heart of the data instead of being proxy–ed around.</p> <p>Finally, there’s <abbr title="Facebook Markup Language">FBML</abbr>,! :)</p> <p.</p> <h4>The development</h4> <p.</p> <p …</p> <p<span class="note">Like the “X Me” application, which didn’t deal with tables in the beginning, but used to constantly read the current markup in the profile box, alter it using regular expressions, and then put it back. For example, if someone would hide an action, it would set it to <code>display:none</code> instead of actually removing it. I got my info from the maker himself :)</span>, but I’d suggest you do it the right way.</p> <p>The documentation is grossly incomplete, but then which documentation isn’t. If you want help, the Developer’s Discussion Group is always there, and people like me who can help you out. There’s also an unofficial IRC room at <code>#facebook</code> on <code>irc.freenode.org</code>. That’s a fabulous place to get info, “if” the people are in a good mood :P</p> <h4>Final thoughts</h4> <p … ;)</p> <p>So, I hope I’ve cleared things out, and hope to see someone from my readers come up with a great application for Facebook :) Let me know if you do!</p> <p>(P.S. — My <a href="" rel="ext">app</a> users count went up to 403 while writing this article! :P That’s how quickly apps can catch on :) )</p>Aditya photos! Who needs Flickr?<p>People not on Facebook probably use Flickr as their main image host, because it’s easier to share it with people, tag them, and store them safely knowing you won’t lose them. Flickr, backed by Yahoo!, has surely become an essential part of the netizen’s arsenal of web–services, no doubt that. But, as with everything, there are alternatives which though not as good, are good enough substitutes.</p> <h4>Facebook Photos</h4> <p>Facebook Photos is one of the best “organised” photo collection tool available on the Internet today in my opinion. Sure, it lacks features which people have gotten used to because of Picasa Web Albums and Flickr, but if you’re looking for a simple photo storage service, with decent sharing and commenting features, this one is for you.</p> <p>The best part is, you’re not bound by features being rolled out by the provider. Applications can enhance your experience, and act as plug–ins, which brings me to the main point of this post. Let me present to you, <a href="">Photos2Rss</a>!</p> <h4>Photos2RSS</h4> <p>This was an application I wrote initially to take away my dependence on Flickr, especially since I found out the 200 image limit on the free account. The one feature which doesn’t come natively with the Photos application of Facebook is a way to get them <em>out</em> of Facebook. Your photos are sitting nicely in your album, but that way they’re only for your friends to see and enjoy. What if you want to share them on your blog, or some other place? Well, now there is a way …</p> <p>If you’re on Facebook, add the <a href="">application</a> to your profile. The application doesn’t add a profile box or anything. It just sits pretty in your list of applications in the sidebar, and you can push it down in the ‘hide’ zone if you don’t want to see the link all the time.</p> <p>Once you have it installed, it’ll take you to the album selection page. There you can select who’s albums you want to pull out as a feed. If you want a friend’s, you’ll need their UID<span class='note'>That's the 9 digit number at the end of the URL on the profile page of your friend.</span>. Fill that in, and you’ll be presented with a list of their albums. Along with that, there are options for randomising the pictures, and a total count. You can specify these for further control on how your photos are pulled. After filling in the details, you’ll have to submit once, before choosing the feed format.</p> <p>There are two feed formats available currently—RSS and JSON(P). RSS is for subscribing to someone’s albums to track it for changes. Say, your friend’s birthday pictures. Whereas JSON(P) is more for use with codes and hacks on blogs and pages. Add in the callback function name at the end and the data will be enclosed nicely in your function :)</p> <h4>Drawbacks and limitations</h4> <p>As I said, this is a little hacky, hence there are some pre–requirements, assumptions and limitations in place for this to work like it’s supposed to. To start with, the photos you want to pull out have to be part of <em>one</em> album, and one album alone. You can pull in photos from different albums, but not using the same feed. Well, not <em>yet</em> atleast. If there are enough adopters of this, I’ll add it in<span class='note'>I’ll add it in anyways sometime in the future to find the easiest way to do it, but more users will speed up the process :P</span>.</p> <p>The second thing is, the application needs to be a part of your list, because that’s the way I’ll get an infinite session key from Facebook for the feed. If you don’t add it, the feed will fail because it’ll need to log in to get your photos out. Like I said, it doesn’t ‘add’ anything to your profile like most of the applications, so there is no clutter :) I don’t like clutter myself :P Once you add it, you can get as many feeds as you want, for as many albums as you want.</p> <p>These are the only ones for now :) With more complexities, some more might creep in, but I'll try and keep them at a minimum :)</p> <p>So, I hope you find it useful, and bugs and feature suggestions as usual can be <a href="">messaged</a>, posted on the application’s wall, my wall, or in the comments here :) Enjoy!</p>Aditya said that?<p>This seems to have been broken for a while. Blogger changed the structure of the comment form page, hence it wasn’t getting the comment author’s name properly. I’ve fixed it now. A quick re–install will do :)</p> <hr/> <p>There isn’t really much history behind this one, except that it was an idea originally put into my head by Avatar, for the old Blogger. Since back then we had the form as part of the post page, and not a Blogger page, a comment quoting system was the ideal thing for a blog like Bloggeratto which needed Avatar answering tons of questions. Back then when I wrote the script, it was so badly broken that I feel ashamed now of it :P</p> <p>With the new Blogger, that system broke since the form disappeared. Although, the idea is still a good one, and the necessity of having a comment quoting system became very glaringly obvious to me right after my <a href="">Blogger Smilies</a> post, where I had to answer tons of comments, and reply to a lot of suggestions. So, I wrote this script a <i>long</i> time back, and it’s been through a _very_ long testing phase. I’m going to finally release it for everyone to use :)</p> <img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5035052176606767570" /><p>It's a really simple script, which adds a ‘Reply’ link to all the comments on the comments page, which you can use to add the body of the comment to the form’s input, with all <code><BR></code> tags converted to line breaks for ease of use, and the text itself enclosed in a <code>i[rel=”cquote”]</code> element for easy styling. It also wraps the quote in nice curly comments for you :)</p> <p>Also, when you click the quote link, a link is created back to that quote, and shown right above the input area. That’s for the unusually large number of comments that you might have to reply to all at once :)</p> <p>Inputs are always welcome!

Enjoy!</p>Aditya has the lead!<p>I’ve been obsessing with Facebook for the past week because of the revelation of the new <a href="" title="Facebook Platform" rel="ext">Facebook Platform</a>. What that has in turn done is show me the intricate ways in which Facebook works. How different components come together to integrate themselves to the central goal of Facebook—to keep people connected to each other.</p> <p>I think Facebook in itself is <em>way</em> ahead of the competition because of their goal. They aim not to have tons of users. Their userbase is a result of constant innovation. They aim to improve the networks that exist, and improve the interactions between the users of the networks. They are probably the only network which emphasizes on innovating, and I think that focus is what keeps them ahead.</p> <h4>Facebook Platform</h4> <p>Some see the platform as going against Facebook’s goal. I felt the same way when it first came out, but as time has passed, and I’ve seen the applications that have popped up, I can guess where Facebook is coming from. They’re not trying to foray into any foreign territory (even if they’ve inadvertently done so). They are trying to make Facebook the one stop destination for all it’s members to find info (about everything) about their friends and the people they know. Applications to track someone’s music, <a href="" rel="ext">activities</a> and calendar are some of the one’s which have popped up, with some of them becoming very popular. The popularity of applications is thanks to Facebook’s social graph, and what I like to call, the Wavefront effect<span class='note'>Huygen's principle states that every wavefront acts as the source of another wavelet. Applying that logic to how news feeds work, when someone adds an application, it shows up in their news–feed, bringing it to the attention to their friends. Their friends then add it, hence starting a new wavefront.</span>. The beauty of this is that the one thing that developers spend most amount of time doing is trying to get their applications to the public. Facebook does that for them, so they can concentrate on building killer apps.</p> <p>This is very tempting to someone like me, developers, who don’t have resources to consolidate data. Facebook provides the data. All we have to do is use our creativity to use that in ways we think people would want to use them. I don’t see Facebook platform as a detachment from their primary goal. I see it as a natural evolution.</p> <h4>Facebook bloat</h4> <p>Many complain about many of the features as ‘bloat’ and unnecessary, wanting to revert back to the old Facebook. Mark Zuckerberg once said:</p> <blockquote> <p>Change can be disorienting, but we do it because we’re sure it makes the site better. It may have felt different at first, but things like photos, events, groups and the wall have all made Facebook a more useful and interesting site.</p> <p>It’s our goal to provide a tool that helps people understand what’s going on with the people around them; all of our additions and changes contribute towards this goal. The new things we’re going to launch will do the same.</p> </blockquote> <p>And all the current features achieve all this in perfect harmony with each other. I can’t imagine a Facebook without the news/mini–feed. That is truly the major thing that sets it apart. The first thing I <em>want</em> to see when I log in is what my friends have been upto since I last logged in. Who their new friends are, what events they’re attending, what pictures they’ve added, what groups they joined … all those things. If I have to go to each and every profile to check what they’ve been doing, it beats the whole purpose of being part of a network … the information should come to you automatically<span class='note'>There was an internal joke here in my hostel, that you remove the feeds, and all the information that Facebook gives you, and you have an <a href="">Orkut</a>!</span>!</p> <p>The reason I see the competition <em>not</em> being able to catch up with <abbr titl="Facebook">Fb</abbr> anymore, is simply because of the path Fb chose and the path the others took. Fb declined the offer by Yahoo! simply to preserve what they had in their own vision. Networks like Orkut have become stagnant, or interfaces to integrations of different services by the parent company, which almost borders on advertisement of those services. Sure, the users are getting all the features that they’d normally want from a network, but they are not getting the ‘integrated’ experience. The different services don’t come together to <em>work together</em>. They are just there working in their own separate modules and cubicles. You’ll never get to know when someone (on Orkut, say) adds a new video or new photo about the party they attended last night. Fb can achieve this by putting two and two together (photos being uploaded after an event the previous day, follows a nice pattern) because the different applications are part of the mothership, and all data finally goes back to a central server, not different parts of the world. That is the key difference between in–house productions and acquisitions. But that is not the point to this…</p> <p>The point becomes (or remains) that Facebook got a lot of things right, at the perfect time. It helped that the brain behind the concepts was a college kid himself, being able to get into the head of other college kids. And if Facebook continues the same way, there is no–way their getting dethroned as the best social network to be a part of (because it’s just plain and simple <em>cool</em>!)! </p>Aditya bubble burst!<p>The past few days have been rather amazing. If you’re not a ‘geek’, then you probably won’t know of all the things happening, but if you are, then I hope you share the same excitement as me! After a rather considerable lean stint in the blogosphere, the general development sphere, things are back to kicking into top gear. I’ll just list out a couple of things that have got me excited and busy the past few days:</p> <h4>Facebook Platform</h4> <p>The biggest and the best announcement :D They opened up their API completely (it existed, but not with so much power) to developers to sit and make applications that interact with Facebook directly, and it’s different components (alerts, groups, etc.). The great thing is that, as a developer, you get to tap into the the best resource which you might need. People!</p> <p>Facebook’s insanely large user–base opens up to every developer, and all his applications that moment they hit the Application Directory<span class='note'>I'm glad they screen the applications that are added to this directory, and are avoiding another Firefox extension–type fiasco!</span>.</p> <p>This afternoon I finished developing my first application for it. It was meant as more of a test than a full fledged commando application like ‘iLike’ or ‘Photos’. You can check it out <a href="" title="So much to do! -- Facebook Application">here</a>, and if you’re on Facebook (why haven’t you added me yet?), add the application and take it on a quick beta spin :) I want to understand the API and all it’s crannies properly before I <em>actually</em> get down to serious app–ing!</p> <h4>Google Gears!</h4> <p>This happened just today, but I think it’s a very good step. From my end, it seems more like a reflex action to all the hype towards making applications for the desktops and frameworks being released to help developers do so. Whatever it is, it is good! The ability for Google services to go offline with you, and then re–sync when you come back online is something that people will appreciate the more that they use, and realise how much they needed this only once they get used to it. Ofcourse, they have a long way to go with this.</p> <p>What I am thinking about now is that how is this move going to affect Mozilla’s plans to add ‘Offline Web App’ integration and functionalities into Firefox. If Google directly allows people to take things offline, an added functionality in Firefox seems like overkill, and will add to the ‘bloat’ that many people (and in a tiny voice, me) are complaining of everyday.</p> <hr /> <p>There are other great things out there now, sure. But these are the one’s that are of immediate ‘Wow’ to me, being a coder and a developer :P Somethings that you might find interesting are things like the new <a href="" title="Microsoft Surface">Microsoft Surface</a>, Microsoft’s <a href="" title="Microsoft Live Suite Beta">Live suite</a> (kind of) in Beta, and others doing the rounds!</p> <p>Great times :)</p>Aditya!<p>‘The Last Word’ has officially hit the 300 subscribers mark :) This is extremely heartening, considering I have not been posting as frequently as I used to. I’d like to apologise for that, and shift the blame a little on a very stagnant blogosphere <em>and</em> my internal examinations (starting tomorrow :( )</p> <a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href=""><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5068462333304354066" /></a> <p>The good news is, that I haven’t lost track of things happening (whatever little is happening), and I will begin posting regularly again after these set of exams get over. Thanks for all the reads! You make my day guys! :)</p> <p>Cheers!</p>Aditya punctuations look good!<p><strong>Oops!</strong> Comments got disabled by mistake. Re-enabled them ... let me know what you think! :)</p> <hr/> <p>Recently, I’ve been rather taken in with smart punctions, rather than the dumb normal ASCII ones. You know, the straight <i>dumb</i><span class='note'>Opposite of ‘smart’ is? ;)</span> quote marks (" and '), or the normal ellipsis made up of full stops (...) ? HTML has predefined special entities to draw these rather nicely, but we don’t use them normally because most of us don’t know about them, and Blogger natively doesn’t convert the characters. Typing them out manually can be such a pain, and you need to remember so much more stuff.</p> <p>So, I worked up a quick Greasemonkey <a href="" title="Pseudo–SmartyPants for Blogger" rel="ext">userscript</a> that adds a nice little link in your row of buttons (in the post editor), which you can use to quickly convert all your punctuations to what they should be. Since there is no way of creating a “plug–in” for Blogger, anything which needs to affect a post directly needs to be tackled at the post editor level.</p> <p>The script is ‘smart’, as in it understands when to use a left curly quote and a right curly quote. It also changes hyphens to what you want them to be. A single or a double ‘–’ generates an en–dash (–), whereas a triple ‘–’ generates an em–dash (—). To know which one to use where, and other punctuation marks, look up the <a href="" title="A List Apart: Articles: The Trouble With EM ’n EN (and Other Shady Characters)" rel="ext">A List Apart</a> article. I referred to it while making this.</p> <h4>Known Bugs and License</h4> <p>Since this went through an extended testing period, and some live testing (I guess you could call it that) on Userscripts, and there hasn’t been a complaint or a request, I’ll assume there to be no bugs :) Except for some weird behaviour when it comes to apostrophes and quotation marks :P And like everything else, this script is licensed under an NC–ND Creative Commons License.</p> <p>The name for the script is taken from the excellent <a href="" rel="ext">SmartyPants</a> project, by the oh–so–creative <a href="" rel="ext">John Gruber</a>. So a big thanks goes out to him for coming up with the idea. I had sent him a mail regarding using of the name and the basic concept. I never got a reply (it’s been about 2 months now), so I took it as a yes and published this :)</p> <h4>Get the script!</h4> <p><a href="" title="Pseudo–SmartyPants for Blogger" rel="ext">Pseudo–SmartyPants for Blogger</a><br/> <a href=";scripts" title="Userscripts repository" rel="ext">All my Userscripts</a></p>Aditya reason behind the action: Your motive<p>I’ve been looking at various sites the past few days. Sites that keep people like Arrington and Om Malik busy. Sites that keep PostBubble up and running. Sites that we hear about all the time, and just go around to have a look because of all the hype created. There have been quite a lot of these since the ‘startup’ times, but how many do you see still being counted among the ‘big guys’? I think the reason can’t be bottled down to sustainability measures…</p> <h4>Stick to your basics</h4> <p>This whole topic came to mind as I was reading about Facebook’s rise up the ladder these past few years. Out of all the network’s, Facebook is the one which has really caught on. There were networks before Facebook, and there have been attempts after it, but you don’t see mention of them as regularly, do you?</p> <p>I think one of the reasons for this is that unlike other networks, Facebook is always looking to grow. Not just in it’s user base, or number of page views/hits. They want to grow technologically as well. They want to enter forays others haven’t. For example, the whole concept of a mini–feed is something “extremely” new, and it’s worked so well. <span class='note'>Of course, it didn’t start off initially the way it was supposed to, but after a few refinements, it’s something that almost defines Facebook.</span></p> <p>An API! When was the last time you saw a social network allow piping out of the data from your account? It’s like the perfect way to build applications that works with the greatest resource — people, based on an established platform which does the hard work of getting you the data. Keeping people together was the only thing Facebook started with, and went on building around that, implementing whatever they thought sounded good. And look at where they are now.</p> <h4>In all facets of development</h4> <p>Whenever you create and develop a project, you always have “something” in mind. It’s that something which you shouldn’t lose focus of no matter what stage of development you are at. Everything you add, implement, should have a purpose, a reason. That purpose or reason should complement your initial “something”. Wonton features won’t help your application, or your time, because just like you, people expect features <em>related</em> to the core reasoning of an application.</p> <p>So, keeping all those things in mind, next time you come up with a game plan, or are asked to join in the development of the “killer–new–app”, look for one word that probably doesn’t get as much attention as it should — focus!</p>Aditya for sale!<p>Seeing as how I have been putting this off for quite a while now, due to various apprehensions, I’m now going ahead with a plan I <a href="">announced</a> a while back. I’m going to start dedicating more time and energy to something that I love doing. Designing web pages! But not just any web page :) Starting now, I am going to start making some beautiful templates for the new Blogger, which will immediately go on sale (the moment they are through testing) for anyone who wants to use them. This will be ‘almost’ freelancing, and the earnings will go into buying myself a hosting, and get down to some serious web–app’ing! :)</p> <p>The price for the template will be decided by the amount of effort I have to put to get the template out the door. They will not be high at all, something in–between the range of $10 to $25. You’re gonna simply love the $25 ones, because those will take the longest and come out the prettiest! Now, I am no professional, but I am sure you’ve seen my works in the past. So I’ll let them talk for me :)</p> <p>Ofcourse, hacks will be included with the templates :) <em>And</em> you get to pick which ones you want! But hacks as much time and effort (if not more) as the actual designing of a template, so if it goes beyond a certain point where I’m having to go out of my way to add something in, I’ll let you know. If you really do want it, a little extra charge will get it for you. The prices will be negotiable for these, so you don’t need to worry about hidden costs anywhere. </p> <p>I’d like to clear out a few things before you begin mailing me about this.</p> <ul> <li><p>Every new owner of a template will have his/her blog listed on an exclusive page linked to from my blogs, with a short description about the blog. Perfect way to get your blog ‘out there’.</p> </li> <li><p>I am a busy person, so if I can’t get back to you immediately about a template modification, don’t think I have ditched you. Wait for a few days, and I will surely get back to you. If you can do the necessary changes on your own, nothing like it!</p> </li> <li><p>My templates will work like they are supposed to only in Opera and Firefox. I have never bothered with Internet Explorer, and never will, so please don’t ask me to fix it for that. As far as Safari goes, I can’t do anything because I don’t own a Apple, so can’t test it on that. If someone is willing to help me port them, however, or buy me an Apple (preferably the latter :P), contact me and we’ll negotiate something. I will also try and make them as resolution independant as possible, but results may vary from template to template.</p> </li> <li><p>These templates are not going to be ‘lightning fast’, and they’ll depend quite heavily on pictures/images and scripts (because of my hacks). Which means, they might be a little slow for <56Kbps speeds. Broadband users won’t see any change however. I’ll remove anything which you might not need however, to increase the speed. There will be no reduction in cost for this however.</p> </li> <li><p>I can’t offer a lifelong maintainance promise for my templates. I will probably quit with this after a certain point of time. Whenever this happens, I will let my users know well in advance.</p> </li> <li><p>None of the templates will have any built in ads, or any pre–decided place for them. We all hate ads, don’t we? But something can be cooked up for you (no extra cost :) ) Also, except for a small design credit at the end of the page, there will no other mention of my name or my blogs prefit anywhere in the template. All the rights will be transferred to you, with a clause of ‘no re–sale’ of the template or any part of it.</p> </li> <li><p>All templates will be microformat and CSS standards compliant. I can’t make them XHTML compliant for the reasons I have stated <a href="">in this post</a>. Nonetheless, I will try my best.</p> </li> <li><p>Request for clones of templates from other blogs can be shot off to my inbox. I will have a look, and discuss with you the pricing and the other formalities. I leave it to you to get the permission from the owner of the other blog to use (or clone) his/her template.</p> </li> <li><p>I will try and entertain requests for custom templates, depending on the time and effort again required to come up with it. Throw in a mail with an attached image of what you have in mind, and I will get back to you if I need furthur clarifications. </p></li> </ul> <p>So, I hope all the terms are agreed upon? I will edit the terms whenever necessary, so keep this post bookmarked for future reference! Cool? Great! So, let’s reveal the first template up for grabs. I call this <a href="" title="Dark Cherry Demo" rel="ext">Dark Cherry</a>. It’s got a mysterious and dark red and black colour combination, with hints of other colours thrown in for a truly amazing contrast effect. It’s got a sidebar, and is divided into a 5 panel layout. The header, the posts (top–left), the main sidebar (top–right), comments / other info (bottom–left) and secondary sidebar (bottom–right). For more info, check out the linked blog for a live demo!</p>Aditya 'em while they're young<p>It’s truly rare to see a young coder/hacker. While I started when I was 16, not everyone is ‘geek’ enough to do so. Partly to do with this is the whole <em>not cool</em> factor, but a good part is to do with the fact that languages are many, most of them not being easy to learn. If you target a learning group of say 13–15 years old, try and find me a tutorial on the web which caters to this group, and can get them programming quickly, even basic programs un–helped.</p> <h4>Not rocket science</h4> <p>It’s a known fact that kids learn the fastest when they’re young. So, not aiming for these young kids is making everyone lose out on so many potential coders, we probably cannot imagine. Given the right language, training and a friendly push, everything falls into place. Even if it means starting out with BASIC, or LOGO. It’s not particularly rocket science, and doesn’t take much to understand when someone starts getting interested. Advanced concepts like pure Object oriented programming can be kept for a later date. Don’t tell me they won’t understand <code>int i = 5;</code> …</p> <p><a href="" rel='ext'>Hackety.org</a> has released a version o.4 of a Ruby starter’s guide. It’s basically a friendly way for kids to learn the basics of programming, using Ruby. Ruby has pretty straightforward reading–English type syntax, so it makes the learning curve flatter. I downloaded the guide for myself, and am mighty impressed by the sheer simplicity (while not compromising power) of Ruby. I’ll surely be looking more into that, later … :)</p> <h4>Get it rolling</h4> <p>We need more efforts like Hackety Hack, which aim to help out and start early with the teaching thing. Once the concepts are in place, other languages become easy to understand<span class='note'>Not learn though. I think Ruby is a good language to get started on since the syntax is simple, but not to continue using if you want to progress with learning concepts</span>. Acquiring the knowledge of a language and the basic concept just needs a bit of time and practice. </p> <p>Kids have more time than grown ups do … sadly!</p>Aditya fight for desktop superiority<p>Unless you’ve been living under a frozen rock in Antarctica, you’d know about <a href="" rel="ext">Adobe Apollo</a>. Now, welcome <a href="" rel="ext">Silverlight</a>! Microsoft’s answer to Adobe, but in the other direction. Silverlight is to the Internet, was Apollo is to the desktop. While initially it didn’t seem cut out, features being revealed slowly but steadily are hinting at a pretty decent enough framework for developers to work with to get people moving towards the Internet. The question I ask here is, “Why are Microsoft and Adobe headed in two different directions?”, and “Is it really worth all the trouble?”</p> <h4>Living in a browser</h4> <p>Weren’t we hailing Web OS, rich Internet applications, stable and asynchronous data flows just a few weeks (or months) back? There were talks of how the only application a person may need on his/her PC would be a decent enough browser<span class='note'>My constant advocation of Firefox might get a little annoying, but in this case, it is necessary because if people argue that Internet Explorer is a decent browser, they will not be half wrong. But IE is a very good <abbr title="Rich Internet Applications">RIA</abbr> killer if you ask me.</span>, and Internet applications will help perform the daily things that people presently depend on desktop applications for. <a href="" title="Google Documents and Spreadsheets" rel="ext">Google Office</a>, aims to provide a useful and feature–full online office suite as an alternative (a.k.a replacement) to Microsoft Office. There are countless online image editors (with Adobe’s Photoshop for the web on the way), and many other applications which we have been so used to using on our comfortable desktops. So then why going back to desktop applications, and why not push the Internet application scene further? I’ll try and answer why …</p> <p>To say the least, the Internet still offers many restrictions when it comes to privacy concerns. When people start <a href="" rel="ext">bellowing down the doors</a> to a bot scanning one’s mail for ‘contextual’ advertising purposes, you know you’re close to seeing everything. How can these people then trust services with really sensitive documents that may contain goodness knows what from their personal or official lives. The moment you put something up on the Internet, you’ve given away a good part of the privacy away. That is a well known fact. What depends is how is that loss being put to use. But that is not the point here. The point is that people will probably never be able to trust a web service (even with the name Google) enough to let it handle their data. The name ‘Microsoft’ will not help reduce their concerns.</p> <p>The online storage scene is only <em>now</em> beginning to gain widespread acceptance with services like DivShare coming up which offer a lot of leash when it comes to uploading and storing/sharing files. Google’s rather liberal storage spaces for their different services shows exactly how cheap it has become to save large volumes of data. This will still take some time. There were forecasts of a time when the online copy of your file is the one which is under regular use, and local copy (on your hard–drive) is actually your backup, instead of the other way around. That prediction is a little far away as of now.</p> <p>Apart from privacy restrictions, the Internet as a platform is in quite a tough spot. There are too many people trying to standardise it in their own way, and failing miserably. The whole XHTML concept is the best example of this. The everyday user wants something that works, and doesn’t care (usually) about <em>how</em> it works. Also, development for the web has only recently hit a peak (as the aftermath of the Web 2.0 boom), as small time desktop developers, seeing the easy and forgiving nature of Internet development languages decided to try their hand at it. If you bring that same ease to the desktop, which is what people are ‘used’ to develop for, why won’t they come back? With that, give them the option of keeping their applications (desktop <em>and</em> online) in sync with each other, and you have a sure winner. That said, Microsoft’s move might tilt the scale, because like it or not, Microsoft happens to define standards wherever it goes. However, the Internet is not really Microsoft domain, so who knows …</p> <h4>That doesn’t mean …</h4> <p>I’m not saying that no–one should develop for the web. Heck no! Without Internet applications, we are all pretty much doomed as the Internet is. What I ‘am’ trying to say is that people<span class='note'>'People' here are not alpha–geeks, but everyday users, who use Outlook to check mails and a browser to just search and surf</span> much rather work with their desktop applications rather than try and make a shift to their online counterparts. It takes the local geek to introduce them to that world, and show them the advantages of getting used to it. Everyone has their preferences and their individual comfort levels. Companies like Adobe and Microsoft understand this, but they are trying to go two different ways because they both see this differently.</p> <p>Internet companies should try and bridge the gap between online apps and local ones, so that whenever someone tries to shift, they aren’t disappointed by the lack of features and shift back. When Google’s Spreadsheets came out, complaints of severe disappointment were ringing loud and clear through the corridors of the web, with people saying that Google was losing their touch and (…wait for it!) … they were out of creativity! If Google has made the first impression, things would have been on a different peak today. They are recovering though, and more and more people are beginning to use Docs and Spreadsheets as collaboration tools, and easy access to their files from anywhere I’m glad they are :)</p> <p>What’ll be interesting to see is if Adobe can actually beat Microsoft at it’s own game, and get a definite upperhand on it’s operating system by having the majority of the applications being developed using their framework, and having them running on Windows. Or will Microsoft gain Internet dominance as well as desktop superiority, and truly change things to a true monopoly. I’d just love that! :)</p>Aditya feeds make blog pages useless?<p>Around the time of <a href="">this</a> post, I saw an unusual rise in the number of visits to my home page. Now, being the home page, it usually gets the highest number of visits, but recently before I wrote that, number began to drop. When that post went up, it again rose significantly (more than a 200% increase to be exact) which surprised me. Further inspection revealed it as the work of a single link to the home page I had put there to show a demo of the TOC.</p> <a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href=""><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5057369041020186450" /></a> <p>This little detail shows how many people actually visit the post ‘on the blog’, rather than read it in their feeds and let it go. The problem doesn’t lie with the blog, I’m sure. Just the convenience of having to see just the post content in a way you’ve become accustomed to, surely lies heavier than having to click over to a blog page to read the post. It’s understandable, but that does put a question mark on the result of the effort authors put into making their blogs look good and adding functionality, amongst other things.</p> <p>There are many blogs out there which look absolutely amazing, have a reasonably high readership and viewership, and impressive subscriber counts. Then there are blogs which have great content, stunning subscriber counts, but look terrible and have moderate to low viewership. I believe <a href="" rel='ext'>TechCrunch</a> might face this problem<span class='note'>This is absolute 100% speculation. If there are statistics that are against and which disprove what I think, please let me know.</span>, because its looks are nothing compared to its content, so people might prefer to stick to reading it in their feed readers rather than come to the page itself. This might also be the reason why TechCrunch posts’ number of comments are not even significant in comparison to the number of readers.</p> <p>So, does it really make sense to sit and design your blog to perfection, only to be defeated by the one thing that you cannot afford to stop?</p> <h4>The point</h4> <p>The biggest reason I think people take time to work on the looks and functionality of their blogs is to attract more viewers and people to come, have a look, stay for a while, leave a comment or two, and then if they’re up to it, subscribe to the blog. A subscribers count is something that gives a much more accurate idea of how popular a blog actually is, and a high number usually impresses people more than the look. So how important really is the design of the blog?</p> <p>Quite a bit I’ll say. The first impression of any page you visit is generally summed up in your brain within a 20<sup>th</sup> of a second of seeing it<span class='note'><a href="" rel='ext'>BBC news article</a></span>, and that is a very small number. So, within that much time, you (very) obviously cannot gain anything of the content of the page. So the only logical deciding factor is the ‘look’! But we also know that looks don’t make a reader–base. It is the content which ultimately decides how many people keep coming back.</p> <h4>The verdict</h4> <p>Looks and functionality are important. Definitely. Without good looks and effective features, your pages have a handicap. And it probably won’t reach it’s full potential of readers. That’s why designers experiment so much with innovative ideas, and new layouts. Who knows what might click<span class='note'>There was a brief period where the 3 column template was a rage, and everybody ran to get one. It’s on the outset I think, but I can still see a lot of blogs sticking to it.</span>?</p> <p>Very recently, Rick from FeedBurner <a href="" rel="ext">wrote about</a> the implications of partial–feeds on click–through’s to your blog. He said that it doesn’t make “any significant difference” to provide summaries. The number of page–views will remain the same. He speaks from factual statistics<span class='note'>FeedBurner handles more than 660,000 feeds! You can be sure he knows what he’s talking about.</span>, but I’d still like to know why that is the case. Why don’t people participate in discussions, or provide their views and outlooks on topics? Isn’t that why you subscribe to blogs in the first place? To get and give opinions?</p> <p>As a blogger and designer, I’d like you to speak up and raise your points. Do you prefer a bad looking blog with good content to a good looking blog with decent content? Do looks even matter, or is it content all the way? I’m sure there’s a balance lying somewhere just out of sight…</p>Aditya perfect!<p>Alright! If there are people going ‘What? Again?’, then it’s completely justified … but I was beginning to get a teensy–weensy bit sick of all the gold all over the place. I realised I can never settle for anything which doesn’t have my basic colours (the ones here) for too long. I anyway cannot settle with one look beyond a few months! :P</p> <p>So, <em>this</em> is what I aiming at initially when I set out to make Golden Summer way back in December–January, but got severely sidetracked and went nuts with it. A simple, minimalistic template which really pushes attention to the post, while not making the whole place look too drab. I switched over to using simple and plain colours, ones which you’re probably used to seeing on pretty much every blog these days. The layout in itself breaks away from my previous two layouts, to go back to the header, post left and sidebar right normal that Blogger has gotten us so used to.</p> <p>This is (as usual) not the final product, but a work in progress. I’ll be moving around widgets here and there to see which one fits the best where. I also might take this whole thing out because I have a couple of more templates in the bunk, so if I begin to like them, you might get to see them as well :P</p> <p>Some of you might notice that this bears a lot of resemblance to basic Wordpress theme layouts. The truth is, I have begun to like the simplicity of those templates, and their ability to be simple, and yet strikingly concise. You can really throw anything at them, and they’ll hold up pretty well, while still looking nice and simple. I wanted to capture that essence in a Blogger blog. I had to hack my way into a couple of things to do that though, and you’ll see them turn up slowly in the next few weeks as I tinker around further.</p> <p>A few things might still be ‘gold’ around here. That’s because I’ve reused them to keep things not looking out of sync. They’ll be fixed soon enough. Let me know what you think! :)</p>Aditya: 3.0 and future plans<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href=""><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5036488935298724706" /></a> <p>It just so happens to be our favourite browser. With <a href="" title="Slashdot" rel="ext">more</a> and <a href="" title="The Inquirer" rel="ext">more</a> vulnerabilities showing up in IE7, it’s pretty much a no brainer selection. Coders love it, designers love it even more! With such a strong past backing them up, Mozilla plans to make some serious headway with Firefox 3.0, and in a way, redefine browsing 'again'!</p> <p><a href="" title="Firefox 3.0 opens door to web apps" rel="ext">InforWorld</a> reports that there are hosts of new features planned for Firefox 3.0. You can read the whole list on the article there, but I want to take up just two of the features which sound extremely promising, and as these things go, open up a whole new door of possibilities for geeks! :)</p> <h4>Databases and offline web app-ing</h4> <p>The article says that Fx 3.0 will <q>likely</q> contain a feature which makes working with web applications offline, possible. Scratching your head? Ok, I’ll take the example from the article, since it’s something people can relate to. Imagine having GMail functionality, offline. You can write a mail, and save it. When you next go online, Fx 3.0 and GMail will work together to automatically send that mail. Pretty much what your desktop e–mail client does at the moment. Now isn’t that <em>cool</em>!</p> <p>What this effectively does is take away an active Internet connection as the restriction to a lot of things. Maybe Blogger will work with this as well, with you being able to store posts offline while on the move, and transfer them to your blog (published/drafts) the moment Firefox discovers an active connection. This feature is almost an answer from Firefox to features like the in–built e–mail client in Opera, the blogging and photo–uploading tools in Flock and any other feature which integrates a web service application natively into a browser. Personally, I think Mozilla has been freagin’ brilliant at coming up with this! It sure makes me want to add <q>sexy</q> to the browser’s name ;)</p> <p>The next feature, will appeal mostly to people who know how to use it. That, for the record, does not include me for the most part. They plan to integrate <a href="" title="SQL" rel="ext">SQL Lite</a> into the browser, albeit in a rather small form. It is going to be used to query content from the browser’s content cache. The immediate use Mozilla sees for this is a vastly improved ‘history’ and bookmarking system. However, there is a good chance this might ‘not’ make it into 3.0. That is not really a problem. Just the fact that such a feature is being developed, is pretty much enough at this point. I can see a lot of load–from–cache and history–extend extensions coming up to use and beat this feature black and blue. This also moves Firefox closer to what Mozilla ultimately plans for the browser, to turn it into an <q><a href="" title="Web browser as information broker" rel="ext">information broker</a></q>. Maybe they could change the way existing variables are handled in Firefox, allowing Greasemonkey scripts to become a little more robust and share data between scripts? (Hey! Just saying!)</p> <h4>Looking good indeed!</h4> <p>The next version is slated for a ‘07 second half release. Ideas and features such as this make the next release one of the bigger ones yet. I didn’t see anything about the <a href="" title="Firefox Places" rel="ext">much spoken about</a> Places, and am guessing they are going to chuck that idea, and make everything searchable (the latest toy of the application world) using the embedded SQL database. It’ll surely much more user–friendly, since the first attempt at using Places didn’t go so well, and people still complain whenever they have to use it.</p> <p>So the next thing to do is keep fiddling through their nightly builds and see which one of them show hints of these features. Or else, wait and watch how the news unfolds. Something tells me this is going to create a wave as big as the lull we see at the moment! :)</p>AdityaStats & Rankings for Isa Moutella

After a week off Andrew Spivey and Nick de la Torre return from vacation to bring you another Gator Country podcast.
While they were away, Jeremy Foley and the Florida Gators were rather busy. Foley was tasked with finding replacements for two of the most influential coaches in the University of Florida’s history in Billy Donovan and Rhonda Faehn. Foley did just that when he found 38-year old Michael White to take over the men’s basketball program and Jenny Rowland to guide the gymnastics program. Two gigantic, program shaping hires in the span of a week.
Also, over on the diamonds, the Florida Gators softball team won their regional and will begin play in the Gainesville Super Regional this weekend against Kentucky — a team they swept earlier in the year.
Kevin O’Sullivan’s ball club will take on Arkansas on Wednesday night for their first game of the SEC Tournament. The Florida Gators are in line to earn a National Seed in the NCAA Tournament with two wins this week — allowing them to play the remainder of the post season at McKethan Stadium.

Soldier with Auburn family ties killed in Afghanistan

A U.S. Army carry team transfers the remains of Army Sgt. Vincent Ashlock at Dover Air Force Base, Del. on Sunday after their return from Afghanistan, a day after he was killed in the Khost province.
A month ago, Sgt. Vincent Ashlock was one of the soldiers honored by North Auburn’s Rock Creek Elementary School for service to our country. With the memory of a standing ovation from his 6-year-old daughter’s school assembly for Veterans Day still fresh in his mind, he was on his way two days later to Afghanistan to serve with the 890th Engineer Battalion, 168th Engineer Brigade. The U.S. Department of Defense announced today that Ashlock, 45, was killed Saturday in the Khost province. No details of his death were released, other than a defense department statement that it took place in a “non-combat related incident.” Ashlock’s hometown was listed as Seaside but Rock Creek school officials said his daughter had been attending first-grade classes in Auburn since the start of the school year. Principal Suzanne Flint said today that Ashlock visited the school for the Nov. 10 ceremony to commemorate Veterans Day and received a standing ovation when he was announced. “He was a really nice dad and also visited his daughter’s first-grade classroom,” Flint said. “He was an active dad and certainly a presence.” The family had lived in Auburn since at least the beginning of the school year. Ashlock’s roots were in Seaside, a community near both Monterey and Fort Ord. The Monterey County Board of Supervisors adjourned its meeting this week in memory of Ashlock, who was the son of Supervisor Dave Potter’s aide Margot Stengle. Flint said the Rock Creek school has sent a letter home with its 305 students to let parents know about the death of a soldier the students would remember from the assembly. There’s also the possibility of a memorial assembly after the winter break, if the family wishes, she said. Ashlock’s niece, Janette, said the family was asking for privacy at this time but did say that the soldier had developed an attachment with the school. “Rock Creek was so supportive and caring and he formed an attachment,” Janette said. While Auburn family couldn’t be reached for comment, his wife, Angela told the Monterey County’s The Californian newspaper that Ashlock also served in the Gulf War and was a longtime soldier with the National Guard. Ashlock told The Californian that her husband wad deployed for a year in Iraq before being stationed in Afghanistan starting in July. He had been back in the U.S. for two weeks for training around the time he visited the assembly at Rock Creek School, she said.Demons ‘disappoint’ in home opener
Steve Lewis/Durango Herald
DHS senior Augusta Brockus was good with the bat and good in the circle, but the Demons weren’t great defensively in an 11-9 loss to the Montezuma-Cortez Panthers on Tuesday night at Aspen Field.
After a 2-0 start to the Chelsea Rodriguez era at Durango High School, the only way to describe the head coach’s home debut was “disappointing.”
“It was a really, really, really disappointing loss,” Rodriguez said in a phone message to The Durango Herald on Tuesday night. “We let that one slip through our fingers.”
Montezuma-Cortez beat the Durango Demons 11-9 on Tuesday night at Aspen Field, the same diamond where Rodriguez just finished her stellar playing career at Fort Lewis College.
Durango brought its bats to its home opener, but the Demons forgot to bring their gloves.
“We didn’t have it with our defense,” said the Demons’ first-year head coach, who played third base for the Skyhawks. “And we made some really timely mistakes. (Alexys) Vidunas did a great job in the circle, and (Augusta) Brockus threw well, but we just didn’t have the defense to back it up.”
Durango will have a couple of days to bring its defense back up to speed. DHS (1-2) will host Delta in a doubleheader at 3 p.m. Friday at Aspen Field, then Palisade at 10 a.m. Saturday.
“I plan on turning it around at practice this week, now that we know what to address to be successful this year,” Rodriguez said.
Steve Lewis/Durango Herald
DHS junior Kelly Perry and the Demons’ softball team ran into nine runs in their home opener Tuesday night at Aspen Field, but they lost 11-9 to Montezuma-Cortez, a game they let “slip through their fingers,” according to first-year head coach Chelsea Rodriguez.
Steve Lewis/Durango Herald
DHS senior Katelyn DeLuche and the Demons had little trouble scoring runs, but their defense let them down in their home opener. “We didn’t have it with our defense,” said Demons’ first-year head coach Chelsea Rodriguez, who played third base for the Skyhawks. “And we made some really timely mistakes.”

People Directory > Phil IrwinA campaign by some southeast Nebraska teenagers has propelled their teacher into the White House.
The Lincoln Journal Star reports that the Crete High School students sent letters, emails and worked social media so civics teacher Bernie Ludvik could get to meet President Barack Obama.
Ludvik intended to attend Obama's inauguration in January but was severely injured in a traffic accident on Nov. 26. As Ludvik recovered in a hospital, students began their campaign, appealing to several politicians. They also raised money to cover Ludvik's trip to Washington, D.C.
Nebraska's Sen. Mike Johanns finally wrote a letter to the White House, requesting a presidential visit for Ludvik. The newspaper says a White House staffer called Ludvik on Thursday, telling him he could meet the president on April 23.Home → News Watch live as Obama delivers remarks on the economy The president is speaking Wednesday about the economy.

Advertisement More More coverage:New Delhi, Nov 29: Subordinate legislation should be easy to understand, have limited scope of discretion by the executive and framed without delay and with wider involvement of people, members of parliament (MPs) from different parties said here Wednesday.
They also suggested that regulatory authorities should be subjected to parliament’s scrutiny.
Speaking at PRS Legislative Research’s first annual conference on effective legislatures, the MPs expressed concern over frequent disruptions of both houses.
Participating in a session on ‘Parliament’s Scrutiny of Executive Rule-making’, Jharkhand Vikas Morcha-Prajatantrik MP Ajay Kumar said subordinate legislations should be formulated in stipulated time.
Kumar said people should be involved in the process of finalising subordinate legislation.
Subordinate legislation deals with detailed rule-making of the law passed by legislatures. In most cases, legislature enacts a law covering the general principles and policies and leaves detailed rule-making to the government to allow for expediency and flexibility.
The government is required to frame the rules in accordance with the policy laid down by the legislature. Such rules are called subordinate legislation and may be referred as rules, regulations, bye-laws, orders and notification.
BJP MP Uday Singh said successive governments have not been keen on extending the number of days parliament meets in a year.
“Faster they get over session, the happier (they are).”
He said the question of orderly functioning of parliament “is germane to whether it is having proper oversight (of executive rule-making)”.
Congress MP Hamdullah Sayeed said there was need for giving publicity to subordinate legislation for wider participation of people.
“There should be wide consultation so that any anomaly is removed,” he said.
Rashtriya Janata Dal MP Jayant Chaudhary said the government should have flexibility in rule-making but the rules should not supersede the act.
“It is a question of balance: how much you put in the act and leave it to the executive,” he said.
M.R. Madhavan of PRS Legislative Research said ministries could give draft rules when legislations go to the standing committees for scrutiny.
Director of Public Interest Foundation Nripendra Mishra, who moderated the discussion, said guidelines for rule-making should be laid down strictly.
Both houses of parliament have standing committee on subordinate legislation.
Speaking at a session on ‘Parliamentary Oversight of Regulators’, Congress MP Shantaram Naik said ministers have to take responsibility for actions of regulators.
“Has anybody blamed a regulatory body? (A) Minister becomes responsible as he comes on TV,” Naik said.
Congress MP G. Vivekanand said parliamentary scrutiny of regulators will be healthy way to judge them.
BJP MP Piyush Goyal said people who become regulators should be good enough to occupy the post and guidelines should be framed for the purpose.
He suggested framing a charter of duties for regulators.
Biju Janata Dal MP Bhartruhari Mahtab said regulators came into existence after the government started delegating responsibilities to private sector.
He said a minister was not responsible for regulator’s decision but was answerable.
“Should there be a single oversight committee or standing committees should look into work of regulators? My opinion is there should be one oversight committee,” he said.
Senior journalist B.G. Verghese said oversight was good but there was a need to be cautious about politicisation of the committees.
Dhirendra Swarup, member-convenor, Financial Sector Legislative Reforms Commission, moderated the discussion.

GLASGOW, Missouri — Water levels are expected to begin falling soon along several Missouri waterways after a recent round of heavy rain caused flooding.
The heaviest flooding occurred Sunday in the northwestern town of Mosby after the Fishing River overran its banks. Nearly three dozen homes took on water.
Along the Missouri River, water levels mostly crested Monday and Tuesday in the state. The National Weather Service is reporting minor flooding in several towns along the river, including Waverly, Sibley and Napoleon. Moderate flooding was reported near the town of Glasgow after the Missouri River crested Tuesday morning at 3 feet above flood stage.
Minor to moderate flooding also was reported along the Grand and Platte rivers.
Meteorologists say Western Missouri received up to 6 inches of rain late Saturday and early Sunday.

crisis is vital because of the impact it has on New Zealand.
Today, John Key was welcomed to trade talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin with full military honours, including troops and a marching band.
The main focus of the talks between the two leaders was the
crisis in the eurozone, and the looming bailout of the Spanish
banks.
The Chancellor has been put on the spot by world leaders who think Germany needs to guarantee the debts of struggling European countries to forestall another crisis.
"It is quite important to talk to leading politicians from all over the world and also explain Europe staying the course, wishing to pursue a course which takes it out of this crisis," Merkel said.
When she was asked if she would support a direct bailout of Spain's banks she gives no ground, despite Spain's sovereign credit rating having just fallen closer to junk status.
Historical turnarounds
Both Merkel and Key could be called historical turnarounds. She
started life behind the Berlin wall, while Key's mother was one of
many who fled Austria and the aggression of an earlier age.
"There are a number of memories I have of my mother," said Key. "But one is obviously her being extremely traumatised.
"She lost her own family members herself in the concentration
camps."
Key had intended to visit Berlin's Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe in the memory of his mother.
"I think the Germans have gone to extraordinary lengths to ensure their people never forget what happened," he said. "I don't feel bitter about that, but I also want to pay my respects for what's taken place."

HCA Safety
Prior to taking the supplement, people may wonder if HCA is safe. Precautions and warnings to be aware of include the possibility of drug interactions and that what you see on the label may not accurately reflect what is in the product. HCA safety precautions also apply to people with liver or kidney disease or diabetes and women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.
Is HCA Safe?Hydroxycitric acid (HCA) is an ingredient often used in weight loss supplements (see Weight Loss Pills). In order to use HCA safely, you should talk with your healthcare provider prior to taking it if you have:
- Diabetes
- Liver disease, such as liver failure, cirrhosis, or hepatitis
- Kidney disease, including kidney failure (renal failure)
- Any other chronic disease or health problem.
Also, let your healthcare provider know if you are:
- Pregnant or thinking of becoming pregnant
- Breastfeeding.
You should also be sure to tell your healthcare provider about all of the medicines you take, including prescription and non-prescription medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements.
Specific HCA Warnings and PrecautionsWarnings and precautions to be aware of concerning HCA safety include the following:
- Supplements (including HCA) are not regulated as closely as drugs. In fact, supplements can be sold in the United States without ever having been shown to be safe or effective.
- HCA may affect blood sugar levels. If you have diabetes, check with your healthcare provider before taking HCA. You may need to monitor your blood sugar more often, and your healthcare provider may need to adjust the dose of your diabetes medications.
- Drugs and supplements are often cleared from the body through the liver and kidneys. Therefore, if you have liver or kidney disease, your body may not handle HCA as well as it should.
- HCA supplements may interact with medications (see HCA Drug Interactions).
- It is not known if HCA is safe for pregnant or breastfeeding women (see HCA and Pregnancy and HCA HCA.

THIS THEORY MAY MAKE SENSE OF COLD FUSION
When Ronald A. Brightsen was a graduate student in nuclear chemistry at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the 1940s, he discovered an isotope called arsenic-78, a short-lived product of uranium fission. His experiments set the stage for a radically new theory of nuclear physics that took shape in the mid-1980s and finally leapt into the spotlight on Aug. 10, when Brightsen unveiled it. He contends that his vision of the structure of the atomic nucleus cracks the riddle of cold fusion, at last describing the mechanism by which hydrogen atoms fuse to produce the energy cold fusion advocates claim to detect. If he's right, fusion in a jar of water may yet be possible.
Brightsen's theory was already laid down by the time the first widely controversial experiment in cold fusion was announced at the University of Utah in 1989. As a safety expert at Westinghouse Electric Corp. and other nuclear power producers, and then as a senior staffer on the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Brightsen was never comfortable with the "fudge factors" used to reconcile theoretical physics with actual results. He wanted a theory that would more accurately predict how much energy would be produced in any nuclear reaction. He got it when he conceived a model of the atom's nucleus with neutrons and protons clustered together not randomly, but in certain precise ways. The energy bound up in these clusters can be released several different ways, which may explain why cold fusion experimenters report forms of energy that conventional physics doesn't account for.
In 1985, Brightsen founded Nuclear Science Research Corp. (NSR) in Reston, Va., to test his theory, partly with computer simulations. Most of the few scientists who knew of the effort were underwhelmed. "I wasn't very impressed," recalls Manson Benedict, the retired head of MIT's Nuclear Engineering Dept. Not so the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), the utility industry think tank in Palo Alto, Calif., which helped fund Brightsen's work. "What he's got is very difficult to argue with," adds consultant Walter Loewenstein, past president of the American Nuclear Society. "Whether it conforms to reality is the question." To find out, Brightsen is spinning NSR into Clustron Sciences Corp., which will be based in Vienna, Va. The company expects to begin work on a cold-fusion power system this fall.EDITED BY EMILY T. SMITHAthletes and go right for it.
Sports are not always this simple. Game play is usually chaotic, unpredictable, and out of one’s control.
This means that we must move side to side and rotate. Respectively, athletes must know how to move in the frontal and transverse planes of movement.
Some other situations of when athletes will need good frontal plane development are as follows.
- Changing direction to go in the opposite way
- Playing defense
- Goalie in just about any sport
- Making moves on defenders, like outside and in.
As you can see the above qualities happen in every sport and about a hundred times in every game.
Injuries also occur in the frontal and transverse plane. Any kind of ankle roll or MCL issue usually occurs when there is some kind of side to side force overloading the body.
Being better prepared for those movements are going to help reduce the risk of injury. We actually had a soccer player have another girl fall into her knee in a game this weekend. The doctor told her that if she hadn’t done the training in the past, she probably would’ve torn something in her knee.
Those are the scary stories that we hear about all the time because in the blink of an eye, an athlete could be out for a year.
When it comes to weight room exercises, athletes need to be strong in the saggital (forward and back) plane first. When doing speed work, they have all mastered moving in a straight line. They have been doing it for years.
Athletes do not have the type of experience in the weight room that they have with speed work and need to master the basics first. Once they have some time under their belt, they can work on developing strength in the frontal planes as well.
There are a number of different exercises and drills that we can use to build strength in the frontal plane.
- Lateral Broad Jump
By starting on both legs there is more support to work with. This feels weird for most athletes at first because it breaks the habit of always jumping up or forward.
- Lateral Bound
We can progress that jump by making in unilateral, or one leg at time. This is one of the more underated movements that athletes should learn how to master. They end up pushing side to side on one leg more often than it seems.
Put it together:
- Lateral Lunge
When training for strength the lateral lunge is one of the best exercises to train the frontal plane. A lot of athletes also struggle with it. They must push their hips back and avoid pushing the knee forward. This is another one that feels weird for most of them.
- Add a pulse
Take that same lateral lunge and add a pulse to it. Now the athlete must come to a complete stop, hold it, and then push back out of the lunge. This happens when we change direction, just much quicker.
This is an idea that makes sense to a lot of hockey players. They send less time pushing forward and back, because skating is more at an angle from the body. For that reason I wrote Slideboard Training for Hockey. The truth is, there is nothing contained in the book that a soccer, basketball, or football would not benefit from.

If citing, please kindly acknowledge copyright © Penelope J. Corfield (2013)
The answer is unequivocally No. (Obvious really but worth saying still?)
History as a subject is far, far too important to become a political football. It teaches about conflict as well as compromise; but that’s not the same as being turned into a source of conflict in its own right. Direct intervention by individual politicians in framing the History syllabus is actively dangerous.
There are several different issues at stake. For a start, many people believe that the Schools curriculum, or prescriptive framework, currently allots too little time to the study of History. There should be more classes per week. And the subject should be compulsory to the age of sixteen.1 Those changes would in themselves greatly enhance children’s historical knowledge, reducing their recourse to a mixture of prevalent myths and cheerful ignorance.
A second issue relates to the balance of topics within the current History syllabus, which specifies the course contents. I personally do favour some constructive changes. There is a good case for greater attention to long-term narrative frameworks,2 alongside high-quality in-depth studies.
But the point here is: who should actually write the detailed syllabus? Not individual historians and, above all, not individual politicians. However well-intentioned such power-brokers may or may not be, writing the Schools History syllabus should be ultra-vires: beyond their legal and political competence.
The need for wide consultation would seem obvious; and such a process was indeed launched. However, things have just moved into new territory. It is reported that Education Secretary has unilaterally aborted the public discussions. Instead, the final version of the Schools History syllabus, revealed on 7 February 2013, bears little relation to previous drafts and discussions.3 It has appeared out of the (political) blue.
Either the current Education Secretary acted alone, or perhaps had some unnamed advisers, working behind the scenes. Where is the accountability in this mode of procedure? Even some initial supporters of syllabus revision have expressed their dismay and alarm.
Imagine what Conservative MPs would have said in 2002 if David Blunkett (to take the best known of Blair’s over-many Education Ministers) had not only inserted the teaching of Civics into the Schools curriculum as a separate subject;4 but had written the Civics syllabus as well. Or if Blunkett had chosen to rewrite the History syllabus at the same time?
Or imagine what Edmund Burke, the apostle of moderate Toryism, would have said. This eighteenth-century politician-cum-political theorist, who was reportedly identified in 2008 as ‘the greatest conservative ever’ by the current Education Secretary,5 was happy to accept the positive role of the state. Yet he consistently warned of the dangers of high-handed executive power. The authority of central government should not be untrammelled. It should not be used to smash through policies in an arbitrary manner. Instead Burke specifically praised the art of compromise or – a better word – of mutuality:
All government, indeed every human benefit and enjoyment, every virtue, and every prudent act, is founded on compromise and barter.6
An arbitrary determination of the Schools History syllabus further seems to imply that the subject not only can but ought to be moulded by political fiat. Such an approach puts knowledge itself onto a slippery slope. ‘Fixing’ subjects by political will (plus the backing of the state) leads to intellectual atrophy.
To take a notoriously extreme example, Soviet biology was frozen for at least two generations by Stalin’s doctrinaire endorsement of Lysenko’s environmental genetics.7 A dramatic rise in agrarian productivity was promised, without the need for fertilisers (or more scientific research). Stalin was delighted. Down with the egg-heads and their slow research. Lysenko’s critics were dismissed or imprisoned. But Lysenkoism did not work. And, after unduly long delays, his pseudo-science was finally discredited.
In this case, the Education Secretary is seeking to improve schoolchildren’s minds rather than to improve crop yields. But declaring the ‘right’ answer from the centre is no way to achieve enlightenment. Without the support of the ‘little platoons’ (to borrow another key phrase from Burke), the proposed changes may well prove counter-productive in the class-room. Many teachers, who have to teach the syllabus, are already alienated. And, given that History as a subject lends itself to debate and disagreement, pupils will often learn different lessons from those intended.
Intellectual interests in an Education Secretary are admirable. The anti-intellectualism of numerous past ministers (including too many Labour ones) has been horribly depressing. But intellectual confidence, tipped into arrogance, can be taken too far. Another quotation to that effect is often web-attributed to Edmund Burke, though it seems to come from Albert Einstein. He warned that powerful people should wisely appreciate the limits of their power:
Whoever undertakes to set himself up as a judge of Truth and Knowledge is shipwrecked by the laughter of the gods.8

WP: Jake SpencerIf you're thinking about SEO, you're thinking about keywords. And FYI, you should be thinking about SEO. Search engine optimization is critical to getting your local business discovered on the web. A survey from BrightLocal shows that Google organic traffic drives one-quarter of all traffic to local businesses.
For good SEO performance, one of the first things marketers need to consider is finding the right keywords. Remember, competitive keywords aren't always going to be the common phrases. The old saying, “Reach for the moon and you'll land among the stars,” does not necessarily apply to keywords – reach for the competitive but attainable phrases instead in order to make your brand a superstar in its own right.
Going for more specific, “long tail” keywords can help marketers find highly relevant audiences and enjoy higher rankings. Plus, a study from Optify.net indicates that long tail keywords that appear anywhere on the first page of search engines see relatively high CTRs. So maybe instead of “home insurance,” you go for a phrase such as “competitive home insurance quotes.” Focused searchers who look for the longer phrase are generally more likely to convert.
So how can you determine which niche keywords might drive the most traffic to your site? You want to stand a chance at high rankings and still keep your keywords relevant to your audiences, and there are plenty of online tools you can use to see which phrases are a fit for your business.
Here are four (free!) SEO keyword tools that ContentLEAD recommends.
1. Google Keywords Tool
The Google Keywords Tool is a commonly used and highly effective service from Google. Even though the tool is aimed at helping marketers with their PPC strategies, it offers useful insight on the competitiveness of different keywords.
You can enter keywords related to your businesses and see their corresponding search volumes, as well as search volumes for phrases that Google deems “related.”
If you check out this tool, you should note that the “competition” tab indicates how many PPC advertisers bid on a phrase – not how many organic listings contain it. Nonetheless, a keyword's paid search competitiveness is probably an indication of its organic search competitiveness.
2. Free Keyword Niche Finder from Wordstream
This service has a free offering and paid components. With the free version of the Keyword Niche Finder, you won't get to see the actual monthly search volume for specific phrases. Nonetheless, it's a quick and easy way to generate niche keyword suggestions related to head terms that might be harder to rank for according to their “relative frequency.”
For instance, when our go-to phrase “home insurance” is entered, the Niche Finder recommends 50 related keywords, including “home insurance mobile owner quote.” A chart indicates each term's frequency, and you can click on niche key phrases that are relevant to your offerings to see other similar suggestions.
3. SEO Book's Keyword List Generator
The Keyword List Generator allows you to input a variety of key phrases, and then returns new combinations and variations on these terms that may help you boost rankings and catch clicks. The free version doesn't offer as much insight as other tools in terms of search volumes and competitiveness, but it is a good way to get some new ideas about search phrases that may draw relevant audiences.
SEO Book claims its service offers a special advantage because consumers tend to search for permutations of the same terms, and the company says paid search marketers see 10 to 20 percent traffic lifts using its keyword variations.
4. KeywordDiscovery
In the past, marketers have ranked KeywordDiscovery as their favorite SEO keyword research source, according to a survey from Lee Odden. It's easy to see why – the (free!) tool collects data across the major search engines, so it offers insight to help boost rankings across portals.
Simply enter a key phrase and KeywordDiscovery offers a list of related terms, complete with their search frequency for the past year.
Once marketers have the right keywords in mind, it's time to put these phrases to work in the context of high-quality content strategies that will attract search engines – and online consumers!Egyptian President
The 82-year-old leader met his new-look cabinet for the first time on Monday as the regime battled to get the economy moving despite pro-democracy activists occupying a Cairo square since January 25.
According to the official MENA news agency, the cabinet approved a plan to increase state sector salaries by 15 per cent from April and to spend another 6.5 billion Egyptian pounds ($930 million) boosting pensions.
Mr Mubarak pledged to launch an “independent" investigation into violence between his supporters and demonstrators on Wednesday at Tahrir Square that left 11 dead and nearly 1000 injured, according to official estimates.
The commission will investigate “the terrible and unacceptable violations that made some protesters innocent victims", it said.
The pay rise might reassure Mr Mubarak’s partisans in Egypt’s large bureaucracy and security forces but there was no sign the demonstrators were ready to retire.

Switching From ABC/3TC to TDF/FTC Cuts Lipids in Randomized Trial
Tenth International Congress on Drug Therapy in HIV Infection, November 7-11, 2010, Glasgow
Mark Mascolini
Trading coformulated abacavir/lamivudine (ABC/3TC) plus efavirenz for coformulated tenofovir, emtricitabine, and efavirenz (Atripla) swiftly lowered lipids in people with high cholesterol in the 24-week randomized ASSERT trial [1]. Graeme Moyle (Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, London) and colleagues believe the lipid improvements after the switch "may have a positive impact on calculated coronary heart disease risk" in these people.
ASSERT's primary objective was to see whether switching from ABC/3TC plus efavirenz to Atripla would reduce fasting total cholesterol in 12 weeks. This open-label study enrolled 157 people taking coformulated ABC/3TC plus efavirenz for at least 6 months with a viral load below 50 copies for at least 12 weeks and total cholesterol at or above 5.2 mmol/L (about 200 mg/dL). At study week 12 the 78 people who had continued ABC/3TC plus efavirenz to that point switched to Atripla and follow-up in everyone continued to week 24.
Median age in the two study groups was 42 to 44 years, about 60% were white, and about 80% were men. Median fasting total cholesterol stood at 6.19 mmol/L in the ABC/3TC group and 6.62 mmol/L in the Atripla group (about 240 and 256 mg/dL). More than 90% in both treatment arms completed week 24.
In the first 12 weeks of the study, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides remained stable in the ABC/3TC group while falling significantly in people who switched to Atripla. Twelve weeks later, people originally randomized to Atripla maintained these improvements, while people who switched to Atripla at week 12 had declines equivalent to those of the original switch group. In the week-12 analysis, all lipid improvements in the switch group were statistically significant (-0.87 versus +0.01 mmol/L for total cholesterol, -6.57 versus -0.02 mmol/L for LDL cholesterol, and -6.28 versus -0.63 mmol/L for triglycerides, all P < 0.001). The total-to-high-density lipoprotein ratio improved moderately throughout the study.
In the group originally randomized to Atripla, the proportion with high fasting cholesterol by NCEP guidelines (above 200 mg/dL) fell from 64% at study entry to 30% at week 24. In the group that switched to Atripla at week 12, the proportion with high cholesterol sank from 48% at study entry to 13% at week 24.
No one in either study arm met trial criteria for virologic failure--two consecutive viral loads above 400 copies. CD4 counts remained stable throughout the study. No one in either group had a grade 3 or 4 renal abnormality during the trial, and no one dropped out because or renal side effects.
Moyle and colleagues concluded that the switch from coformulated ABC/3TC plus efavirenz to Atripla "leads to a significant, rapid decline in lipid parameters towards desirable levels (per NCEP guidelines)." They rated this switch strategy "appropriate in the management of hypercholesterolemic patients."
A double-blind placebo-controlled AIDS Clinical Trials Group study found that adding tenofovir to a stable regimen significantly improved nonhigh-density lipoprotein cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and total cholesterol HIV-infected people with abnormal lipids [2].

“Regional magazines capitalize on the fascination with ‘things local’ and also benefit from strong local advertising,” according to Trish Hagood, president of Oxbridge Communications, publisher of the directory. “Many regional magazines are also pitched to an upscale audience making them doubly attractive to readers and advertisers.”
Over the five year period from 2003 to 2008, the number of news magazines saw the greatest decline, dropping 39 percent from 75 to 45 publications, according to the directory. Shelter magazines saw the biggest spike, jumping from 83 to 241 titles.
With its advertising in a precipitous decline, U.S. News & World Report in June announced that it would move to biweekly frequency in 2009—effectively ending its status as a “newsweekly”—and shifting its focus from news to its “Best of” franchises, health, business and education coverage and daily content on its Web site.Veg-Table.net Vegetarian Restaurant and Travel Guide

TribLIVE Sports Videos
The Western Pennsylvania Soccer Coaches Association's ninth annual all-star games will be Saturday at Moon High School, and Plum senior forwards Shane Rings and Matt Baleno and Gateway senior goalkeeper Nate Kleya will take part in the contest for Class AAA/all-state players.
The AAA/all-state game is at 2 p.m. and caps off a tripleheader of soccer action involving 90 top WPIAL senior players from each of the three classifications.
The Class A game will be at 10 a.m., and the AA game will follow at noon.
Kleya, Baleno and Rings earned recognition on the Finest 17 All-Section 3 team released a couple of weeks ago.
Baleno and Rings then were voted to the All-WPIAL squad.
“(The all-star game) is a great honor for any player,” Gateway head coach Chris Duda said.
“It's some of the best players in all of western Pennsylvania, so the soccer is going to be great.”
Kleya was the full-time starter in goal for the Gators this season after splitting time in 2011.
He helped Gateway go 6-11-1 overall and 4-8 in Section 3-AAA play, a two-game win improvement in both categories from 2011.
The Gators produced five shutouts this fall, including a 1-0 triumph over North Hills in the season finale.
Baleno and Rings will play on the same team in the AAA all-star game, but players from the same section could find themselves on opposite teams, Plum head coach Mike Baleno said.
“I think they try to divide the players into teams as evenly as possible,” he said.
Rings and Baleno helped lead the Mustangs to a second straight WPIAL playoff appearance in 2012.
Plum finished 9-5-3 overall and was 6-3-3 in Section 3, including a 2-0-2 mark down the stretch in section play.
“This game is a great thing for Matt and Shane,” coach Baleno said.
“I've seen them continue to develop into great players the past four years. This is a great finish to their high school careers to be able to play with the best. It says a lot to what they've done to get to where they are today.”
A number of the participating players already have made their college choices final, but others in the three games who still are undecided on where or if to play at the next level will have a chance to impress a number of college coaches who will.News Release

Hawk Edwards pleaded guilty Thursday to criminal vehicle homicide in the death of 65-year-old Paula Bergren. The former Duluth man also pleaded guilty to criminal vehicular operation for the injuries suffered by 13-year-old Edward Everett Bergren.
Edwards, who had been living and working in the Williston, N.D., area, admitted in court he was driving drunk the morning of the Jan. 19 crash in Duluth.
The Duluth News Tribune reports Edwards agreed to serve a four-year prison sentence for each crime. As part of a plea agreement, he'll be eligible to have his prison time reduced if the injured boy substantially recovers.
Sentencing is set for March 30.

Newark, NJ – Jun 6, 2010 – Photo: Evan Bindelglass / WCBS 880
NEWARK, N.J. (CBSNewYork) —.”
But lifelong resident Angel Reynas was quick to defend his brick city.
“Travel Magazine — they don’t know what they’re talking about, because they don’t live here,” he said.
Over 38 years, Reynas said he has seen the shining stars of the people of Newark.
“They help old ladies – like me, you know, they give people passes and stuff like that. They treat people well,” he said.
Melissa Marie, who has lived all around the world, likewise told 1010 WINS’ Gary Baumgarten that Newark had received a bum rap.
“You’ve got a lot of people who will speak to you – even the people who are homeless. There are a lot of colleges as well. I think people pretty much bump into each other and they have to say hello, goodbye, or deal with each other – but they’re usually friendly, I think, in general,” she said.
She added that there is gentrification going on in Newark, with art galleries and great restaurants in the business district.
But some newer residents such as Julianna told Smith they definitely see a nasty side.
“Maybe at the bus stops a lot, they just, like, push you out of the way so that they can get on the bus — like that kind of stuff,” she said.
One woman said she has lived in Newark for just three years and is ready to leave.
Cork, Ireland ranked as the friendliest city in the worldwide survey. Readers of the magazine called it a “very accommodating place” where residents are “friendly and helpful” on a consistent basis.
Newark also ranked at the bottom of a separate list of the friendliest and unfriendliest cities in the U.S. Branson, Mo., was ranked as the friendliest city on that list.
Being ranked at the bottom of a list compiled by a magazine has sparked protests in at least one city in the past.
In 1987, Money Magazine ranked Flint the worst place to live in America, placing that city at rock bottom among 300 municipalities nationwide. In a scene famously shown in Michael Moore’s documentary “Roger and Me,” Flint residents responded by burning Money Magazine at a public rally.

By Chris Gotz, Creative Circle Chairman and ECD Ogilvy CT
The annual, traditional, tremendously accurate, never biased, ever-so-wise Cannes predictors have gathered again. They have selected the pieces of local work that might, just might, cause their creators to spend all their per diems in a single round of drinks at the Gutter Bar celebrating their Lions. Although chances are they won’t be at Cannes, so their ECD’s, who of course will be there, will buy the drinks and celebrate like they did the ad – after a quick, shouty, side-huggy telephone call on the steps of the Palais to tell the team how amazing they all are and just how generally awesome everything is, and how it would be so cool if they were able to be here too (if the ECD hadn’t flown Business Class and spent all the money). Apologies, that was a long sentence. Ad people don’t normally write like that. Generally they write like this. You know – lucid, short, intelligent, crisp sentences. Everyone tries to sound like David Abbott’s body copy for Sainsburys. And (ad people can start sentences with and – because we’re, like, f#ck grammar, we’re ad people) the point is (because there is a point, really, there is) that you will only win in Cannes if we don’t behave like ad people. We will win at Cannes by doing stuff no-one expects us to do.
These are the Cannes predictions, so there better be some soon. I also need to make up for my ludicrously tangental intro paragraph. So here are a few wild predictions:
1. Next monday morning, also known as Shortlist Monday, will probably be depressing for most of us. We will trawl the raft of Cannes shortlists looking for our work. While doing so we will come across amazingly well-crafted print ideas from China (hand drawn for months, possibly years, by carefully selected teams of juniors with small hands). There will also be incredible Brazilian activations using hand-reared Unicorns combined with large football crowds to promote gene therapy programmes for, say, a new children’s hospital. And, of course, there will be Swedish digital pieces (created by perfectly groomed men with beards and women who dress like a Vogue version of Pippie Langkous) using drones, sensors and polo bear migration habits to market a new 4×4. What we are not likely to find, unless we work for Wiedens, are vast amounts of our own work.
2. To compound the inadequacy of those of us who don’t have heaps of shortlists, there will be the air-punching few who do. The rest of us will say “wow, that’s awesome, good luck.” Although many of us (the mean –spirited ones) will secretly harbour hopes that the shortlisted work will Stuka-dive spectacularly out of the show as the famous “Hispanic judging bloc” goes about their dastardly work.
3. There will be a shit Thai television execution featuring a life size locust and an insurance salesman. It will win something. There will be low tuneless whistling when it does.
4. Rob McLennan will lose his luggage, or be rerouted to Vladivostok, or both.
5. Marketing blogger Herman Manson will not be at Cannes, because (his words not mine) “Awards do not equal creativity and excellence.” Fortunately the CEO’s and CMO’s of some of the world’s largest corporations (who clearly disagree with Herman) will be there. In addition so will musician Jack Black, Formula 1 Driver Jenson Button, Conan O‘ Brien, Director Sir Alan Parker, Editor par excellence Tina Brown, Annie Leibowitz, Anderson Cooper of CNN and many more.
6. Japanese tourists will take photos of ad people on the red carpet outside the Palais des Festivales, thinking they might be minor celebrities. The ad people being photographed may also consider themselves minor celebrities. They will all be wrong.
7. People, perhaps people you know, will win. This will lead to much enthusiastic neck grabbing, fist bumping and feigned modesty. This will be followed by rounds of drinks more expensive than a small townhouse in Honeydew.
8. One of the Juries will pick a Grand Prix that makes a “statement”. This could be a film that’s not really a film (a really overhyped, boring activation with a guy jumping from deep space for instance). It may be a radio spot that’s actually a channel emitting a virtually inaudible throbbing hum in an attempt to talk to the aliens. There have been many of these over the years, all as awful as they are mystifying.
9. There will be incredible, gasp-inducing work, lots of it. It will inspire us and crack us up and makes us hate Swedish web people and anyone who works at Wiedens or BBH or Ogilvy Sao Paulo more than ever. Best of all, it will make us desperate to do work that is equally as good, equally as category breaking, equally as inspiring – which, if you think about it, is why Cannes and everything associated with it, is there in the first place.
Good luck everyone, if some of the truly lovely work that’s been selected here is anything to go by, it’s going to be extremely tough to win this year.

therefore, only slightly better in prediction. MATH SCORES are an excellent

And now it's been confirmed three times over.
But let me back up.
We're officially moved out of our house. We had the final inspection yesterday. I'll be thankful if I never see a bottle of 409 or Windex for a long long time. You never realize how filthy your home is until all the furniture is gone.
So there was a lot of scrubbing after the movers left.
Speaking of the movers, they were nice enough but reeked of smoke.
And they broke our couch.
Not all the way but one of the attached cushions snapped off when they were pushing it into the van.
I was not pleased.
So that's something we get to claim in Wyoming and let me tell you, the claiming process is a pain in the butt.
The final inspection went well. The inspector made me nervous, he was actually opening cupboards and, well, everything...I had it in my head that he'd just walk around the house and make sure there weren't any big stains. It made me so nervous that I had to leave the room and sit in the living room with Tommy. Each time he'd open a cupboard I'd suck in my breath and I'm sure I paled slightly.
We passed, obviously.
And now, the house is no longer ours.
As for our hotel room..
See, in the military, when you leave a base they usually give you what's known as TLF or Temporary Living Facilities. It's a like a mini (MINI) apartment. Something you'd find in New York City, I imagine.
We thought we'd be getting that.
We got our keys, no problem. Found the building we were in, no problem. Stuck the key in the door, opened it and..
Walked straight into the one room that would be ours until November 1st.
It's a regular hotel room!
No living space.
Just a bed. A rollaway bed for Tommy. A TV, bathroom and several dressers. The kitchen is tiny tiny, you have to share with the person in the attached room so that means no quick dart to the kitchen for water in your underwear.
(This morning I think I scared our kitchen mates, I had just woken up, got dressed [thank goodness I got dressed] but had not brushed my hair yet. My hair, when I wake up, goes everywhere and I was busy preparing Tommy's waffles when the neighbor walked in. I made her jump and she went, "Oh my..")
Also, there is no stove!
Which means we've had to eat out a lot, which means more money spent.
We have sandwiches for lunch.
But there are only so many sandwiches a person can take!
So we usually go out for dinner.
In TLF you get a stove so I was planning on preparing meals.
But we can't.
Do you know how difficult it is being in a confined space with two boys?
Tommy usually goes to bed at 830 but obviously he won't since Tom and I are still up. We can't exactly roll him in the bathroom (not enough space) or the kitchen (the neighbors would call social services I'm sure.) So he's usually up until we go to bed, running all over the place. I mean there is NO place to send the kid.
And Tom..
UGH.
I love him to pieces but he gets bored fast. He's been playing his PSP but then he'll grow tired of that and be all, "I'm bored.." And I'm sitting there reading, because I'm quite capable of entertaining myself and he's suddenly all over me, resting his head on my shoulder, my lap and I'm all,
"STOP TOUCHING ME FOR THE LOVE OF GOD."
Yes I finally snapped today and said that.
I mean crap, we've been in that tiny room since Wednesday.
I've had it.
I'm an only child, I'm used to SPACE.
Of course Tom got all insulted.
But where could he stalk off?
So he huffed and puffed on the bed, muttered out, "You don't love me," and then grumbled under his breath.
Then he started playing PSP again.
We have been watching quite a bit of TV..like I watched America's Next Top Model and Tom took it all seriously.
"Oh my gosh they can't vote her off, it's her GRADUATION DAY!" he kept saying over and over.
(I guess when you're confined to a tiny space small things become very very important.)
So yes.
I feel like I'm going insane.
I keep calling the front desk, asking for a bigger space.
"Ma'am I don't think you understand. I'm pregnant, I need to rest, I can't rest because my four year old won't sit still, my husband zones out on his PSP and snores like a bear..I need space!"

Oz is always talking about the importance of being able to read food labels and how companies actually use deceptive terms to make us thin we are getting healthy products that are just as bad as regular products. He has devoted two shows this season to exposing the facts about food labels and deceptive advertising.
Today’s show focuses on a variety of areas. Jeff Rossen goes undercover to expose misleading diet products and actually does a segment on the contaminated air inside and Ice Hockey Rink that may be putting your kids in danger. Dr. Elizabeth Cohen is known for exposing problem areas in the medical industry. Her no nonsense approach works to empower the health consumer as to what you can demand and expect from your health care providers. Anthony Melchiorri is known for his exposure of the hotel and travel industries worst secrets. He will be showing us the hidden dangers we need to look for in our Hotel rooms and air travel.
Oz says 1 in 10 of us will be a victim of a health scam or some type of fraud this year. He says this gives honest companies problems when people tend to blame a whole industry for the malpractice of just one entity. This will be an interesting show so please make sure you check back here on CMR for our full recap of all the latest news Doctor Oz is talking about today.

© TC Media File Photo
The contract, issued by New Brunswick Power Distribution and Customer Service Corporation, calls for installation of the fixtures over a five-year period, with deliveries starting later this year.
LED Roadway Lighting Ltd. (LRL) has signed a contract with NB Power to supply approximately 72,000 Satellite™ series fixtures for deployment across the province. The contract, issued by New Brunswick Power Distribution and Customer Service Corporation, calls for installation of the fixtures over a five-year period, with deliveries commencing in the fourth quarter of 2012.
The new light fixtures will replace existing 100-400 watt high-pressure sodium (HPS) fixtures. The installation of the new energy efficient fixtures will provide energy savings of approximately 60 per cent (or a total of 27,000,000 kwH per year).
"We're very excited to be working with NB Power on this project, which we believe is the world's largest single order for LED street lighting," says LRL President and CEO Charles Cartmill. "We began working with NB Power in 2010 on a number of pilot installations. After an exhaustive product and technical evaluation, and a competitive bidding process, the client selected LRL's technology. A contract of this magnitude by an end-user such as NB Power is a major validation of our technology."
The LRL fixtures, which have a design life that's significantly longer than conventional HPS technology, will also provide significant savings in maintenance costs.
In addition to the economic benefits and improved lighting conditions, the retrofit will yield greenhouse gas reductions of approximately 324,000 tonnes over 20 years, an amount equivalent to removing approximately 3,000 cars from the road.
This announcement is the latest in a series of project awards announced by the company. Last month, two other major contract awards were announced, one in Salford, UK consisting of 24,000 fixtures and one in the Dominican Republic consisting of 8,000 fixtures.<<

Since food trucks came to town, people who work in downtown Minneapolis have many more options for lunch. But some skyway businesses say that's hurting their bottom line and they've had to close, Edward Moody reports (2:03). <br><br><em>WCCO This Morning – July 24, 2013</em>
Hola all. Massawyrm here.
Here’s something I just had a hard time wrapping my mind around. An Al Gore movie. Seriously, an hour and a half lecture by, and a documentary about, ex-Vice President and Presidential Candidate Al Gore and his views on global warming. How can a guy known as wooden at best, and positively robotic at worst, make a film that doesn’t make Lars Von Trier movies look like action packed, tightly paced, thrill rides?
Well, because the Gore-bot 2000 is dead. A relic. A thing of the past. Al Gore is far from what he used to be. An Inconvenient Truth not only proves to make a compelling call to action about global warming, but also makes Al Gore seem like something he hasn’t before to many people. Human.
Now, I typically try to keep my religion and politics out of my reviews, knowing just how incendiary such subjects can be. Especially on the Internet. And frankly, film is incendiary enough stuff that I don’t feel I need to throw gas on the fire. But here, with An Inconvenient Truth, I feel it is almost inescapable. For me, at least.
Those of you who know me well or read my blog know that I am an incredibly politically minded guy, and even more importantly, a Republican. A lifelong, old school, traditionally conservative (which doesn’t mean what many of you think it means), Republican. And I have SERIOUS ISSUES with Al Gore. Have for nearly two decades now. Granted, most of my fervor stems from his support of his wife Tipper, who founded the PMRC (the guys who put labels on records and CDs) and crusaded to ban offensive albums, films and television shows.
And for a traditionally conservative Republican pop culture junkie – the idea of censoring ANYTHING is a cardinal sin – especially at the federal level. Throw onto that his views on using the military as a peacekeeping force in other countries and his part in the Clinton Administration and you start to paint a picture of exactly the kind of politician I have problems with. So as you can probably guess, I voted against him in 2000 (you know, back when Bush still talked like a Republican) and hoped that would be the last I heard of him.
Needless to say, the idea of waking up early on a Friday morning to listen to Al Gore talk for 100 minutes was not exactly my idea of fun. But like I said, I just couldn’t wrap my mind around it. I mean, this sort of thing just isn’t done. This isn’t a Documentary about a politician who was followed around by a docu-crew. Gore plays a large part in the making of and the structure of this film – both as a subject and creatively. And Ex-Politicians, especially Ex-Vice Presidents, are supposed to fade into obscurity. They take cush jobs at large firms that do world wide business, or sit on the board of large corporations. They don’t continue the crusades they failed at when in power. Not unless they’re Jimmy Carter. But Carter’s a whole different kind of cat – the only President in modern history to be a better man after his presidency than he was during it. Vice-Presidents don’t make films. Not like this. It was something so insane I HAD to watch. I couldn’t pass it up. It was like one of those links your buddies post that reads: Click here to see something so vile it will scrape out your soul. You can’t help yourself. And neither could I.
Now, understandably, this film has stirred up a lot of controversy. Unfortunately, the controversy is far less scientific than it is political. You see, somewhere along the line my party stopped being the party that quoted the founding fathers. Somewhere along the line we stopped being the party of a sound, cohesive philosophy that virtually every republican held, despite our personal, issue-based beliefs. Somewhere along the line “Ditto Rush” stopped meaning, “Wow, Rush said exactly what I’ve been saying for years” and became “Well, if that’s what Rush said, that’s what I think too.”
And already the smear campaign has started, encouraging Republicans to boycott this movie. Because apparently, we aren’t allowed to make up our minds for ourselves anymore. The party line is what we’re told to believe, not what we actually believe. And the party line on Global Warming is “We don’t have enough evidence to support a position either way, so why risk hurting industry for something that’s just a theory?”
Well, with An Inconvenient Truth, Al Gore sets out to challenge that way of thinking and manages to turn what could easily be a 100 minute episode-of-Nova snoozefest into a riveting conversation and argument on the need to reduce our CO2 emissions. This is effectively a filmed version of the lecture he’s been giving over the last six years, inter-cut with a series of personal anecdotes shot at locations pivotal in Gore’s life. Using stories of his past as metaphors, Gore manages to introduce us to himself in a whole new light, while simultaneously laying the groundwork for arguments made later in the film. And those arguments are incredibly simple – elegantly simple in fact.
While not entirely unassailable (as arguments go), what seemed like a “Save the Spotted Owl” plea for environmental consciousness rapidly became a wrecking ball of rhetoric that tore down common myths and hit every point in the argument, from personal cost, industry and the technology needed. This isn’t some crazy, left wing, bleeding heart, tree hugger plea – this is an honest to god, very well thought out evaluation of facts, figures and concepts. And its an argument, valid or not, that is so good, it should be heard by members of all political slants and bents.
This film, this lecture, comes across as very personal; a passionate argument in the old school sense of the word. This isn’t the stodgy, stiff shirt Al Gore we all remember – this is an Al Gore who jokes openly, is warm and entertaining and speaks with pain about his loss in 2000. You can easily tell that he’s a changed man, someone who while on the track to the White House gave us what he thought we wanted, and now, with nothing to lose, can let it all hang out and just be himself.
And the man before us in the film, well, he’s one I quite like now. He’s been moved from the category of people I never hope to meet into the realm of “Man, I’d really love to pick this guys brain over a cup of coffee.” And believe me, that’s a BIG deal. This is a guy I believed stood against most everything I believe, and while he still may, I no longer think it’s because of anything but that we want different things and have different priorities.
And man, can I understand why he’s getting the BIG QUESTION in every interview he does. Because if there was ever a way to make a HUGE comeback, this movie would be it. If Gore was able to take a dyed in wool conservative who practically spit when he said the guys name and not only earned his respect, but endeared him to him, I can only imagine what this film would do to the independents in this country – let alone the liberal base that feels let down by him.
If enough people saw this film, and he kept up this kind of attitude, he could probably win the nomination in a walk. But personally, I hope he stays true to his word and chooses not to run. This crusade seems to be a much better fit, and it strikes me that he can accomplish more good outside the system than he ever did within it.
The film is simply great. It changed my opinion on a great number of things, educated me with an argument that properly debunks a lot of misconceptions, and turns some really dry material into something that never for one second bored me. Gore really seems to know his stuff, but more importantly, really knows how to explain it. That doesn’t mean Gore’s argument is by any means unassailable.
There’s plenty to be said to counter both the science and the rhetoric. But it’s a good argument, and its one worth hearing. (Please note that as I am in no way, shape or form a scientist of any kind, I make no claims to the validity or truth of global warming. But, as a film critic, I am afforded the ability to say that Global Warming lends itself to pretty good filmmaking. Except for Waterworld…and the more ridiculous parts of The Day After Tomorrow. And anything by Paul W.S. Anderson, whether he’s done a global warming film yet or not.)
Now, if I have one complaint about this film, it’s one of my usual gripes. The marketing. Sometimes I feel like I’m beating a dead horse, but this really has to be addressed. If you look at the poster for the film, or it’s unbelievably dramatic trailer…well, it’s certainly jarring. It has this immediacy to it. It uses the work ‘Shock’ about a billion and six times. The tagline is “By far, the most terrifying movie you will ever see.” And yet, it’s not. The marketing is scary, and probably will do more to scare people away than anything else.
In truth, this movie isn’t very shocking (except in regards to the aforementioned personality graft Gore received post election.) Instead, rather than sending you out of the film thinking “Oh, God we’re so fucked” it manages to end on a very positive note that leaves you thinking, “Man, I really need to change my light bulbs and get my car tuned up.” It makes you want to write your congressman, because, it can be done. Gore ultimately reminds us that it is a number of small changes - not big ones - that can really have a lasting effect, if performed by enough people. I kinda wish they’d go back to the ‘penguins in the desert’ poster, as much as I thought it was silly, because it is much closer in theme to what this movie is trying to say.
This isn’t a scare piece; it’s a motivational piece and a rational argument. I just wish they’d start treating it like one (because nothing says rational like penguins. In a desert.)
I highly recommend this film to anyone old enough to understand it. It is probably one of the sanest, most coherent, and from the heart pieces of rhetoric you’re bound to hear or see in an election year. Is it propaganda? Of course it is. It’s a persuasive argument made with images and style. But that by no means makes it something worth ignoring.
If anyone sees this, I think it most important for those of my own party, if for any reason other than hearing this argument from this point of view, that we begin to once again – as a party – think for ourselves and argue from our own knowledge of the opposing opinion rather than what we’re told it is. If we continue to let Coulter, O’Reilly and Savage do our thinking and speaking for us, then it will be left to the Al Gore’s of the world to make the only sane, informed arguments – and we’ll be left with few who can actually argue against them.
And I’d like to take this time to personally thank Al Gore for inventing the internet, without which I would be unemployed ;)
Until next time friends, smoke ‘em if ya got ‘em. I know I will.

Jim Ruffalo: High-flying government pension costs scrutinized
By: Jim Ruffalo
Looking Behind the Scenes
File
Jim Ruffalo
Jim Ruffalo
Looking for a good online auction site while telling Meg Whitman if she’s going to spend that much personal money on running for elective office, then she really ought to try for a Bell City Council seat ... Big bucks — or perhaps lack of same — will be on the collective minds of the Placer County Board of Supervisors as it begins work on the next budget. Compounding the problem will be an upcoming announcement that Placer County’s property assessment levels are falling at about the same rate as the president’s popularity poll numbers. I’m told by a very reliable source that assessment figures for the county are off close to another 6 percent. And just for the record, the City of Auburn’s are about another percentage point lower than that. What does this mean? Well, let’s put it this way; when was the last time the county laid off a department head? One thing for sure is that the next round of contract talks with county workers will spend an inordinate amount of time when it comes to the issue of benefits, especially pensions. Talk among supervisors’ staffers is that while at least one supe would like to see “zero” as the starting figure for how much taxpayers’ money should be spent on providing pensions, there will be some money allotted for that expenditure. Recently, former U.S. Secretary of Labor Robert Reich addressed a gathering of county supervisors and the like at Reno. Among his remarks was, “Today we have a license to do things that haven’t been done before.” In case you haven’t figured it out, he was referring to government-funded pensions and — what he sees — as the need to get control of those costs. Placer County Supervisor Jim Holmes was in attendance, and according to his remarks to the Meddlers, “I wouldn’t doubt that (the board is) looking for more cost-recovery.” Holmes was making a specific reference to the cost of providing medical coverage for current and former county workers. After the meeting, he told me that “the current rate (of taxpayers costs) is unsustainable.” He’s right, of course, and being an elected official possessing a lengthy business background, he knows what happens when anybody finds out there’s too much month left after the money. Holmes added that he doubted there’s to be a wholesale ending of such benefits, but drastic cuts probably aren’t out of the question. Yes, something has to be cut. It would just be a welcome change if this time the cuts were made on the largest paychecks instead of the smallest ... Getting hosed? I run the following not so much because I’m painfully bothered by the deal. Rather, I do it because the numbers are so interesting and intriguing. These numbers are culled from the latest commercial lease proposal between the Newcastle Fire Protection District and CloudBase LLC (owners of the firehouse at 9111 Highway 193). It calls for the district to pay a collective $400,000 for the next five years (beginning on Sept 15), with an annual cost of living adjustment after the fifth year. The district also makes a $10,000 security deposit, and the district has the option of purchasing the building for $1.5 million any time during the first five years. The district is also on the hook (and ladder?) for insurance, service and utility fees and must “maintain all landscaping and irrigation including on CalTrans easement.” And after all that, the district doesn’t even get reserved parking rights, but must play catch-as-catch-can with the other nearby tenants ... Sergeants Four: No this is not the sequel, which would be tough seeing as how the Rat Pack has left the building. Instead. I refer to the four sergeants’ positions inside the Auburn Police Department. If everything goes right starting with the City Council meeting, those four positions will soon make up the newest labor-bargaining unit. Before, those spots belonged to the Auburn Police Officers Association (APOA), but because of an overly officious effort at the lowest level, the sergeants decided to get out of Dodge. No surprise here, seeing as how at least one current sergeant was made to feel extremely unwelcome by a few members of the APOA during the last contractual go-round. And it’s a good move organization-wise because those sergeants are sometimes called upon to assume functions normally handled by lieutenants, of which APD has none at present. Good move, especially considering that little by little, the APOA is becoming a cartoon of its former self. Jim Ruffalo’s column runs Sundays in the Journal.

As one particular of at least four corporations applying for the license, Century Casinos is managing a consortium of Austrian folks, entrepreneurs and investors. A 26% share in as well as a management agreement with all the newly established “Century Betriebs AG” tends to make Century the leader from the group. A decision to grant the 15-year license is anticipated in Q4 of this year. There is absolutely no assurance that the enterprise will probably be granted the concession by the Austrian Minister of Finance.
The enterprise expects “Century Betriebs AG” to invest approx. $18 million in the event the casino concession will probably be granted. The casino will be developed in an elegant retro 1960’s style in the 450-room Hotel InterContinental, Vienna and target domestic and international tourists, enterprise travellers, congress and convention guests too as affluent domestic and European casino visitors. Soon after a nine months construction period, the casino would offer you approx. 300 slot machines and 25 gaming tables on a 16,000 square feet gaming floor.

well, i think Ima do a little house cleanin. we have this purdy ornamental rug in the trailer before the cats tore it to shreds, and covered it with offal. some years back, Daddy (RIP) had polished off a bottle and a half of Windex, and he got a hankerin for some Sesame Street Chickens? So he went into town to the fancy Chinamin eatery for to pick some up? but when the waiter came out to give him his order, daddy up and had a vietnam flashback, and yanked the rug out from under him. That poor chinamin suffered 2nd degree burns on his face from the eggdrop soup what spilled on him? well, daddy decided to keep that ornamental rug to help ward off roving bands of chinamin and puerto ricans. Its all scratched up and tattered now, and covered in feline leavins, but I think it's workin, on account a I aint never seen no ornamental folks round these parts. So maybe I'll keep it around, ya think?
well, them American Pickers came by the trailer to sift through all my treasures I keep piled in my yard? at first I was reluctant to let them strangers on my property, but that skinny one was real persistent like. I had Daddy's (RIP) sawed-off scatter gun just outta sight, ifn one of them boys tried any funny business -- the fat one with the beard had a lustful look in his eye, when I caught him staring at my front butt? Trouble is, I'm fresh outta buckshot since I went raccoon huntin, but I kept it handy nonetheless. well, them boys got right to pickin. At first, the fat one had an especial interest in my old oil cans I like to store my toenail clippings and urine in? Hoowee, he lost interest after he opened the first one! The skinny geek kept askin me about what was in my shed what mama (RIP) used to chain me up in when I got ornery. I screeched and squeeled at him not ta open it! But he did anyways, and as soon as he did, an avalanche of old kitty litter came a crashin down on him. what a dumb dumb, he was covered in old sick cat leavings what was getting in his mouth and eyes? and he was dry heaving and yellin at his camera man to, "cut! cut!" well, I had about enough of them two pickers at that point, so I started huckin my used adult diapers at them sos they would vacate my property! I splashed the fat one right in the face, Praise God! It was a fresh loaf still steaming toboot! And his beard was all covered with my back butt leavings. Boy Howdy, was he cussin something rabid! That'll learn those History Channel eggheads to quit poking they noses where they aint welcome! __________________

Apple Modifies iOS Developer Terms to Allow Limited Analytics Data Collection
Back in mid-April, Apple updated its developer agreement for iPhone OS (now known as iOS) to ban analytics companies from gathering data from iOS devices being used on their ad networks. The result of the change initially appeared to be a crippling of third-party networks in favor of the company's own iAds platform, as advertisers rely heavily on analytics to assist them in their advertising efforts.
As last week's interview at the D8 conference, Apple CEO Steve Jobs forcefully noted that the change was sparked by analytics company Flurry's publication of data showing devices in use on the Apple campus. Jobs was apparently referring to was January report from Flurry showing approximately 50 tablet-style iPhone devices being used at Apple. Acknowledging the value of analytics data for a number legitimate uses, however, Jobs said that Apple would be willing to revisit the topic of data collection with those companies once Apple had cooled down over the issue, "but it's not today."
MediaMemo now reports that Apple's has again modified the relevant portion of its developer agreement, Section 3.3.9, to at least partially open the door to limited data collection for analytics purposes.
If you compare and contrast with Apple's earlier version, you'll see the message is clear: It's OK to collect user data to help sell ads -- though you will need to get their permission to do so.There is a catch, however, as Apple's new wording requires that any analytics company receiving data be an "independent advertising service provider whose primary business is serving mobile ads (for example, an advertising service provider owned by or affiliated with a developer or distributor of mobile devices, mobile operating systems or development environments other than Apple would not qualify as independent)".
The "independent" qualifier would would seem to prohibit AdMob from receiving such analytics data due to its status as a subsidiary of Google, which is clearly a developer of mobile operating systems. Smaller competitors such as Greystripe and Medialets, however, should be free to obtain analytics data upon receiving appropriate permission.This).
The reverse confirms that the front is a real photograph for the area where a stamp could have been adfixed is a space surrounded by a printed 'KODAK/AUSTRAL/KODAK/AUSTRAL with a '+' in all fourcorners. There is no evidence that the postcard passed through the mail (Figure 2).
My research of this postcard was totally unrewarding. A long distance call and several emails to Allan Tompkins, President of the Barham, N.S.W./ Kondrook, Victoria, Historical Society led to a deluge of valuable information about this event. In one of his emails Allan Tompkins stated that "I can confirm that the ‘play’ was actually a fund raiser for the war effort (WWI) - more of a pageant to honour the various Queens and to crown the top money maker."
The local Barham paper had a comprehensive entry headed ‘BARHAM CORONATION CEREMONY’ followed by the request: ‘(We have been requested by the ladies of the Barham Red Cross Society, to insert the following).’ What follows has been extracted from a much longer paper, as follows:
"This Royal celebration was produced with great spectacular effect, in the Barham School of Arts on Wednesday evening July 19th, to a crowded house, and one of the most appreciative and interested audiences , that has ever occupied the large and commodious building....As the time drew near for the ceremony to begin, hundreds of expectant eyes eagerly watched the raising of the curtain... to witness the grand ceremony...The Barham orchestra with its well organised players opened with the National Anthem. This orchestra proved a most agreeable surprise as many had not known of its existence, and great credit is due to the success of the various selections played, and the able assistance given by the many artists during the evening...The orchestra played its first selection (as) the curtain rose on a scene which ever will remain a gratifying pleasure in the memory of those who were fortunate enough to witness it".
"The scenic effects were produced by our local artist (Joe Bruscha) was grandly descriptive of the royal throne room, with its massive pillars, and beautiful ruby plush curtains fringed with heavy gold fringe, and held in position by gold cord and tassels. To a slow march played very softly by the orchestra, entered two handsome pages clad in ruby velvet wearing white hats with beautiful plumes to match. Slowly and solemnly they approached the centre of the stage, separating to allow the Queens and retinue to pass between them".
"To the same strain came the two trumpeters in costumes in brown and gold tunics, with brown tights, caps of purple velvet with plumes at side, who marched to the front of the stage blowing fanfare of trumpets, during which the Herald advanced, in a rich costume of green satin, lacings of red silk cord, white gauntlet gloves, hat with plume, and announced the first Queen (Mrs. McConnell) Queen of the Golden Fleece. The approach of this matronly dame, who carries her years with such dignity and grace, and of whom her supporters were truly proud, was the cause of a great ovation."
This was followed by a long description of her costume: she had a train of gold plush held by two youthful train bearers, a girl and a boy both having the McConnell surname, whose costumes were also described, and following the pages were two maids of honour. All walked to the front of the stage where the Queen made a courtly bow to the audience, and she retired to one of the thrones, where she sat in state.
"Then followed a recital of ‘Kitchener’ by Miss E. Dalton of Koondrook, also a second selection by the orchestra, and a tableaux "The Gleaner" with lime light effect represented by six little girls". There was a concealed chorus of girls who sang the ‘gleaners song’ which proved a most suitable tableaux for the Queen of the Golden Fleece.
"The Herald then announced the Queen of Public Service and Oddfellows Lodge (Miss R. Chanter)" and this young and enchanting Queen’s extravagant gown was extensively described.
The Herald then announced the third Queen, Miss G. McPherson, Queen of Commerce, and the whole procedure was repeated, and was followed by a song by Miss O’Donnell ‘The Rosary’, and the performance of this talented artist received loud applause. This was followed by selections from the orchestra as tableaux, including those of patriotic appeal, ‘Britannia Rules the Waves’, ‘Man of War’ and ‘Britannia’. A miniature "Man of War’ ship, also an engine and trucks made by one of our boys (J. Elliott) completed the effect. ‘The Heroes of Anzac’ tableaux with lime light effect was most appropriate to the present war time and appealed to public sympathy. Then followed the crowning ceremony with announcement of the votes by Mr. Scobie M.L.A. (acting as mayor of Barham), as follows:
Queen of the Golden Fleece 44,607
Queen of the Public Service and Oddfellows Lodge 26,994
Queen of Commerce 12,399
Total number 84,000
Proceeds of the competition £350
Amid loud applause the winning Queen rose from her throne and bowed her acknowledgment and she was arrayed in her royal robes by her maids of honour. The Archbishop Rev. Stowards performed the crowning ceremony, and read the proclamation.
"The noble and fitting climax to the evening’s entertainment" was a complete surprise to me for Miss O’Donnell sang the Russian Anthem.
Prior to the conclusion, a Miss V. O’Donnell of Bendigo, one of Melba’s pupils sang and gave a beautiful rendering of ‘Theres a Land’, which was encored.
A map of a small segment of the mighty Murray River shows Barham, New South Wales and Koondrook, its smaller sister town in Victoria, is seen in Figure 3.
This border area between the two States is believed to have been occupied by the indigenous Wemba-Wemba people prior to white settlement. The 114,656 acre ‘Barham’ station ws taken up in 1843 by Edward B. Green, who named it after the maiden name of his wife. The Barham Koondrook Bridge opened in October 1904, and this landmark lift-bridge is still in use (Figure 4).
Barham is now the Wakool Shire’s largest centre and has a current population of around 1200 residents. Barham and its twin, Koondrook, to-day obtain their main industries from cattle, fat lamb, dairying, timber and tourism. Barham is 860 kilometer south-west of Sydney.Hoke was top notch at this aspect of his job.
Zen And The Science Of Third Down Conversions
Part II
Yesterday I muttered about math and explained some stuff. Today I try to convince you this is interesting.
The Strange Case of Florida State
Florida State was a team with a bear of a defense and an intoxicated duck of an offense, right? Well... not on third down. Check the Castor and Pollux act:
That's a significant amount of green in each graph--unsurprising from the defense, palpitation-causing from the offense. Despite the doublemint action directly above, I do not mean to suggest that the Florida State defense (generally regarded to kick seven kinds of ass) is hardly distinguishable from the Florida State offense (a unit that actually could have used the services of Wyatt Sexton this year). No sir, I object. What we're missing here is the second component of third-down efficiency: your tendency to get in manageable distances. It's here that two additional graphs bring the difference between the two Seminole units into stark relief:
Yow! Jeff Bowden's criminal misuse of Booker and Washington is illuminated for all to see: so many passes clunked uselessly to the ground on early downs that that approximately 20% of the Florida State offense's third downs were full third-and-tens, more than double the national average. They only got in third and one half as much as a Hypothetical Totally Average Team (HTAT).
Conversely, the Florida State defense's pedestrian performance on third down is okay in the overall scheme of things, since there is evidently a significant amount (seven kinds, even) of ass-kicking going on on first and second down. Look at all that red on third and five or less. Look at all that green from third and ten to fifteen.
My thinking has suddenly become very clear on this case, man.
Conventional Wisdom Isn't Always Unwise
These days, it's hard to tell whether the spread is more popular in college football or the San Fernando Valley. As a result, much is adone about it from the dredges of the blogsphere to the vulcanized-rubber towers of the people who actually get paid to write. Invariably much is made of the spread's strengths and weaknesses. Continually cited is the spread's difficulty in short yardage and goal-line situations, but one would figure this goes hand in hand with increased efficiency in the middle distances the classic dink-and-dunk spread offense is designed to get on every play. So a hypothetical spread team's efficiency graph would look considerably flatter than the nationwide average, starting out subpar from 1-3 yards but then beating the average in the middle distance.
What's the quintessential spread team? Hyyyaaaarrr!!! Texas Tech, matey! Well, check it out:
Avast! The conventional wisdom... is right on? There's a first time for everything, I guess. Similar results can be seen in the offenses of Illinois, Northwestern, Hawaii (sort of), Michigan State (sort of... the MSU offense is too good to be held down much but has a big ugly red spot right at third and one), Oregon, Miami (Ohio), and Purdue. Indiana and their spankin' new spread offense defies this trend, as do a few other teams recognized as spread specialists, but in general it appears that they are the exception rather than the rule.
Quantified Later, But...
I'll try to put a number on this in the near future, but I'd be surprised if any team in the country has a better pair of
Stergers efficiency graphs than Ohio State:
That is a lot of green. No doubt OSU was helped on offense by the candy-soft defenses it opposed, but that OSU defense faced a wide array of the country's most powerful offenses and still came out on the good side of things no matter what situation you put them in. Hallelujah: nine of those guys are gone. Un, er, -halleluja: the green field of the offense returns mostly intact.- 0.17Acreage

Hey everypup ~Scooter here~
What is better than TV season? Mom sits on the couch and we all snuggle in for skritches. I like to grab the spot on one of the couch pillows and flop over so my bellah is easier to reach and skritch.
You know when it is going to be a good night when the popcorn is popped and the lights dim for whatever Mom wants to see on TV. I just know that buttered popcorn is very tasty and worth reminding Mom she needs to give up another kernel or so. Or so, or so, or so to infinity and beyond.
Sometimes if it is a bit chilly the fire burns in the fireplace and we get to listen to the wood crackle and stretch out in front of the warmth. Except that room doesn't have a TV, so it is for the nights when Mom reads the Kindle.
If it is chilly when watching TV, the heat maker comes out and we all stretch our warm toes out at the wonderfulness. I pawsonally like to slide right under the warmth range so it skims over the top of my body. You don't overheat so fast and sleep is so easy to find when you are cozy warm.
TV season is the best thing for it being dark so early now. Pretty soon it will be dark before Mom even gets home.
Sniff at ya later ~Scooter~

This palace was inspired, in part, by the palace at Versailles. The salmon-pink rococo edifice was ordered as a royal summer residence by Dom Pedro III in 1747. Architect Mateus Vicente de Oliveira took five years to make the place habitable; Frenchman Jean-Baptiste Robillon spent 40 more executing a detailed Baroque plan that also comprised imported trees and statues, and azulejo-lined canals and fountains. You can tour the apartments and elegant staterooms, including the frescoed Music Salon, the Hall of Ambassadors, and the mirrored Throne Room with its crystal chandeliers and gilt trim. Some are now used for concerts and state visits, while the old kitchens have been converted into an ordinary café and a fancy restaurant with an imposing open fireplace and a vast oak table.

Posted by: editor on Sunday, November 21, 2004 - 08:28 PM EST
By Bill Rosenberger
Tony Watson and the Viking Tour host venue had a lot in common on Saturday, November 20. Smokin' Cue Billiards is the name of the poolroom, and smokin' cue would describe Watson's hot stroke.
With wins over Robin Hill, Cletus O'Dell, Andre Edelman, and Steve Frail, Watson earned a berth in the hot seat match. His opponent, Ron Park, had also had convincing victories over Scott Lewis, Bill Delk, Brian Capps, and Mike Janis. Just as they had all day, Watson and Park battled down to the wire, but Watson took the hot seat with a 7-5 win.
Park was down but not out, and he bounced back fast with a 7-3 win over Mike Bumgarner in the semifinals. The finals rematch was set, and it would be just as close as their previous contest.
Watson built a 6-4 lead, but Park nailed a 6-9 combo to inch back to within one game. Park broke in the twelfth rack, and it looked like he could even the match, as he ran the first few balls. After a miss that left Watson a 5-6 combo, Park could only watch as his opponent finished out the rack for the 7-5 win.
Results:
1st Tony Watson $1,005
2nd Ron Park $600
3rd Mike Bumgarner $400

Be the first reader to review the Narcissus 'Camelot' Daffodil!Green Bay — On the sideline with the play card in his hand and a notion in his head, Green Bay Packers coach Mike McCarthy can sometimes be a walking, talking, headset-wearing bundle of contradiction.
There's the McCarthy who professes to want a physical football team able to run it up the gut anytime it wants and use the Old-Man-Winter advantage it has at Lambeau Field in the latter months of the year.
Then there's the McCarthy who has thrown the ball 45 or more times in two of the last three games, one of them a bitter loss at Chicago and the other an overtime loss to Washington on the road. Both games begged for a running game to control the ball and take the opposing crowd out of it.
So, what in the name of a 38.7-to-61.3 run-pass ratio (his 2010 numbers) is McCarthy thinking when he's holding that card? Is he really as pass-happy as he appears? Or does the Packers' 17th ranking in pass attempts per game this year prove otherwise?
Since his hiring in 2006, McCarthy's run-to-pass ratio is 40-60, compared to the league average of approximately 45-55 during that same time. Most of those who have watched McCarthy's teams since 2006 would say he has little regard for the running game and prefers to pass.
"If you want to get into a philosophical discussion, I have zero interest in the way some people are trying to make this, we're just a passing team," McCarthy said in a wide-ranging interview about his run philosophy. "That's not true. Judge me after 10 weeks. Judge me after 16. We're not a seven-on-seven team by no means, we never will be."
At the same time, McCarthy admits he harbors the same feeling many West Coast play-callers do, including former Packers coach Mike Holmgren - that it's easier to complete a short pass than gain yards running the football, especially if your team is built around a great quarterback.
When told there would seem to be more variables and moving parts in a pass play than a running play, McCarthy completely disagreed. In his opinion, it's more likely a quarterback and receiver are going to connect on a short pass than a running back is going to find a hole and gain positive yardage.
"If you run the football and nine guys get their block and one guy messes up his block, what happens?" McCarthy said. "He could get tackled for a loss. In the passing game, does it take nine of them to get it right?"
Reminded that his receivers dropped seven balls in the loss to Washington on Sunday, McCarthy said he still believes it's advantageous for him to pass the ball when the defense is going to give him an easy completion.
"What about the times where you go to run the ball and they have more than you have," McCarthy said of overloading a side. "And you have 20 guys from the hash all the way over and you have Greg Jennings over there or Jermichael Finley and he (the quarterback) jumps up and throws it to him.
"He gets 7 yards or it could have been a touchdown. They go, that's a pass, but it's really a run. How many of those do we have in a year? Three a game the way we play."
McCarthy said it would be unwise to draw conclusions about his run philosophy from the Washington game. He said he went into it fully intending to run as much as he passed, mostly out of two- and three-tight end sets.
But on the second play from scrimmage, tight end Donald Lee injured his chest after taking a hit and fumbling and Finley tore cartilage in his knee tackling the player who recovered. For most of the last 50 minutes of the game, his tight ends were Tom Crabtree and rookie Andrew Quarless.
"When I want to run the ball, we put our hand in the dirt and I don't give a lick what they line up with over there," McCarthy said. "We lost pretty much all of that with those two injuries Sunday afternoon. Those are the facts.
"Now we have adjusted runs, where we're going to go to the line of scrimmage and run it, but if you have more over there than I do, then hell, I'm not running it over there. Either run it over there or throw the ball. That's the way we played on Sunday."
The result was 46 pass attempts and 17 runs, four of them carries by quarterback Aaron Rodgers. Despite the low number of runs, the Packers gained 157 yards rushing, largely on the strength of Brandon Jackson's 71-yard carry. However, Jackson and John Kuhn averaged 4.7 yards per carry on the other 12 rushes.
The contradiction on this one is that McCarthy thinks Jackson could fill the void left by the season-ending ankle injury to Ryan Grant, but that he needs more carries to be productive. How is he going to get more carries if the offensive philosophy is to replace some runs with passes?
What's more, McCarthy believes his offensive line has played well. He said the performance against the Detroit Lions in Week 4 was the best the line had played "in quite some time." Yet the only time he really stuck with the run game was in the final 6 minutes of that game.
"I want to win and I know all the variables for my team," McCarthy countered. "There are more variables than he just ran it or passed it. I think if you're going to evaluate a play-caller and you say he runs it too much or passes it too much, then you're not really evaluating the offense, in my opinion.
"That's why when I get asked about it I'll answer, 'That's convenient,' sometimes."
To be fair, McCarthy did run the ball 33 times against Philadelphia and 27 times against Buffalo, and it's absolutely correct that the strength of his offense is the quarterback and his receivers. In addition, he lost Grant in Week 1, and it has taken Jackson time to adjust to being the No. 1 back.
General manager Ted Thompson could have done McCarthy a big favor by trading for running back Marshawn Lynch - sources said players and some coaches were strongly in favor of it - but maybe Thompson thought Lynch would be wasted in McCarthy's offense.
Offensive coordinator Joe Philbin works with McCarthy each week in developing the game plan and said the two still have confidence in the running game despite the absence of a big-time runner. They think the differences in Jackson, John Kuhn and recently acquired Dimitri Nance offer challenges to opposing defenses.
But let's face it, none of them is Grant or Lynch.
"I think we're capable of moving the ball on the ground against anybody," Philbin said. "I think our guys feel that way. Now we have to go out and do it."
It's anyone's guess what the play card against Miami will show Sunday. Likely it's filled with passes McCarthy thinks he can complete on the Dolphins secondary, but with Lee returning and Crabtree and Quarless having a full week to prepare for more prominent roles, maybe it's half-filled with runs.
McCarthy said he'll always be about scoring points and not 50-50 ratios, but he also said that when it's all said and done the running game will have made an impact.
"Now, are the (passing) numbers higher than what I want them to be? Yeah," he said. "But to me, these conversations are really about after 16 games. I don't really get why I have to ride this merry-go-round every year where somebody picks up a stat sheet and goes, 'Uh-oh, they need to run it more.' "
"It's Week 5, it's Week 6. It goes that way. It's no different than an individual player not having his opportunity. If you want to make a point about it, OK, but I have to answer six questions about it, I don't view it that way. I don't think we have an issue running the football. I think the fact of the matter is when we wanted to run the football we've run it. I feel good about where we are running the football."

However, in places like Hubli, Bijapur, Gokak, Haveri, Belgaum and other regions of North Karnataka, there was not much impact on the Darshan's film.
In fact, the Diwali festive season turned out to be a wonderful time for Sangolli Rayanna, as it made wonderful business during the holidays. A source says, "People thronged into theatres to watch Sangolli Rayanna in the last few days and the number of screenings were increased to meet the demand. Though Jab Tak Hai Jaan has also got good response in North Karnataka region, it did not affect, as people in this regions were more interested to watch the film made on their son Rayanna."

It has been three years since starting my study on Intermittent Fasting (IF) and its proclaimed health effects.
I am finally ready to go public.
A quick background story…
Why IF? Because for almost a decade I’d been interested in the subject. Can we really lose weight, improve health and even live longer by staring at an empty plate every now and then? It was against everything I’ve learned, in the gym, in bars, even in med school.
Seemingly, there was a lot of confirming evidence to be found online, showing amazing body transformations and improved health for many individuals. I spoke with many of those people. – Wow, to hear the stories was such an inspiration. But from a scientific standpoint the stories were highly biased and not doing much to further improve our knowledge. You think anyone ever changed their feeding frequency and kept all other things equal? Of course not. How than can we know what Really improved their life? IF or the fact that they also changed their training routine, stopped smoking and started to walk to work? Or a combination?
I wanted to see what we knew at this point. How much was the subject really studied and what did the evidence say?
I finished the work in about one year and the result was awesome. The audience loved it.
I got my MD and felt on top of the world.
But where do I go next? First, the idea was publication in a scientific magazine. For many reasons, taking time from becoming a good clinician being the most important, but far from single one, I eventually decided not to go that route. Ambivalentia led me to sit on it for way too long, sharing it only with personal friends and people I respect…but not much more. I just could not decide what I wanted to do with it. Since finishing it I’ve had several offers from various ‘important’ people wanting to use my paper. The problem was always integrity. This is my baby. I’m not interested in other people making a quick buck on something that was my life for over a year and giving me a piece of the cake.
Finally, after some recent online pressure – I decided to give it away for free – right here. There is no use in it sitting on my dropbox-account.
Please show your appreciation for the enormous work that this required from me, a hyperactive person that normally can’t sit for more than 10 minutes. And the fact that you are getting it for free, on a sliver plate, without having to spend 300 nights, bent over scientific papers, pulling your hair out.
Share it with your friends – the social media buttons are on your left. If you like it, please drop a comment below, let me know. Don’t be anonymous.
If you want to know more about IF I’d recommend you to buy Brad Pilons book Eat-Stop-Eat. The book, in my opinion, is not perfect, and I don’t agree with all the conclusion drawn in there – but it is by far the most complete recourse available for purchase out there with practical implications for anyone interested in the IF lifestyle, and it has helped many people get leaner and healthier with a relaxed mindset.
Without hesitation the best online recourse on the topic is my dear friend Martin Berkhan’s Leangains.com . Martin is the original popularizer of the IF method and has researched the subject extensively. He also helped me get the project started with some pointers and connections. What’s more, he is a great dude and I made a friend in the process, and that I am very grateful for. He is a guy I’d share my last beer with. Martin, I know you’re reading this so thanks, bud.

The effects of intermittent fasting on human and animal health –
a systematic review
Thesis January 2012, University of Lund by Bojan Kostevski
Center for Primary Health Care Research, Lund University, CRC, SE-205 02 MALMÖ, Sweden
Supervised by: Bengt Zöller, Staffan Lindeberg
Examination: Daniel Arvidsson
Keywords: intermittent fasting, calorie restriction, obesity, aging, cardiovascular health, glucose metabolism, cancer, neurodegenerative disease.
Abstract
An increasing number of animal studies have shown altered markers for health in subjects exposed to intermittent fasting, i.e. regularly and repeatedly abstaining from eating during 12-36 hours per period. It has been hypothesized that the reported beneficial health effects from caloric restriction on excess body weight, cardiovascular risk factors, glucose metabolism, tumor physiology, neurodegenerative pathology and life span can be mimicked by alternating periods of short term fasting with periods of refeeding, without deliberately altering the total caloric intake. Therefore, a systematic review of available intervention studies on intermittent fasting and animal and human health was performed. In rodents, intermittent fasting exhibits beneficial effects including decreased body weight, improved cardiovascular health and glucose regulation, enhanced neuronal health, decreased cancer risk and increased life span – some of the effects independent of the effects attributed to calorie restriction alone. The human studies performed to date are generally of low-quality design. Beneficial effects such as weight loss, reduced risk for cardiovascular disease and improved insulin sensitivity have been observed, but conflicting data exists. The potential health promoting effects of intermittent fasting in humans and applicability to modern lifestyle are discussed.
Introduction
Calorie restriction and intermittent fasting
Almost a century has passed since Osborne and colleagues in 1917 observed that reducing calorie intake in rats increased the animal’s life span (1). In 1935, McCay et al. were first to describe that calorie restriction – deliberately reducing calories without causing malnutrition – prolongs mean and maximal lifespan in rats compared with rats fed ad libitum (2). Numerous subsequent studies have confirmed that a calorie restriction of 30 to 60 percent of ad libitum intake increases the life span by similar amounts in a range of organisms including yeast, roundworms and rodents, while simultaneously decreasing or delaying the occurrence of age related diseases such as numerous cancers (including lymphomas, breast and prostate cancers), hypertension, stroke, diabetes, nephropathy, autoimmune disorders and other risks factors for cardiovascular disease (3,4). Furthermore, it is suggested that calorie restriction can display beneficial effects in rodent models of various neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and Huntington’s disease (5). Accordingly, overeating is considered a risk factor for the majority of the conditions mentioned above, further supporting the hypothesis that calorie restriction can be beneficial (6,7).. Twenty years into the study, 80% of the calorie restricted animals were still alive, compared with 50% of the control fed animals. The data obtained to date suggest that calorie restriction slows aging in primates and improves health.
Calorie restriction in humans is associated with weight loss, reduced inflammation and improved markers for cardiovascular and metabolic health in obese{Formatting Citation} (9,10) as well as non-obese (11,12) subjects, proposing a novel therapy for increasing life span. However, adherence to the recommended calorie reduced/low fat diet remains an issue for some people in the long term (13,14).
To improve compliance in human subjects, a model in which calories are periodically restricted has been proposed. Intermittent fasting is a paradigm where periods of fasting are cycled with periods of over-eating where subjects are fed ad libitum. Alternate-day fasting, one model of intermittent fasting has been widely used in animal calorie restriction research because it has shown to result in reduced food intake over time and decrease body weight in rats (15). In human trials, intermittent fasting has been shown to be equally effective as daily calorie restriction for causing weight loss in obese subjects (16).
While alternate-day fasting leads to calorie restriction over a two-day period in many rodent species, in some strains of mice, the animals managed to compensate for the calorie deficit created on fast days by increasing their intake on feast days twofold and thus keeping the total calorie intake over a two day period at the same level as in mice fed an ad libitum diet (17). These mice managed to maintain constant body weight but, interestingly, still acquired some of the health benefits as rats on daily calorie restriction. This lead to the hypothesis that by implementing periods of fasting, one could improve health without deliberately reducing calorie intake. My objective was to review relevant intervention studies on the effects of intermittent fasting on energy balance, cardiovascular risk factors, glucose metabolism, neurodegenerative pathology, tumor physiology and life span.
Significance: The study will be important for the understanding of excess caloric intake and the management of obesity, and identify ways to alter cardiovascular, metabolic and neuronal health.
Methods
A systematic review of intervention studies in mammals, including humans was performed. PubMed between 1973 and 2011 was searched by use of relevant MeSH terms related to the effects of intermittent fasting on excess body weight, energy balance, aging physiology, cardiovascular risk factors, glucose metabolism, tumor physiology and neurodegenerative pathology. For each of the MeSH terms, the search process was restricted by use of non-MeSH terms such as “intermittent fasting”, “periodic fast”, “alternate-day fasting” and other relevant terms. All terms used are listed in Table 1. Furthermore, relevant review articles on calorie restriction and intermittent fasting were reviewed for additional relevant studies to include in the review. Studies were included in the review if short term fasting was the primary intervention and studied any of the above mentioned outcomes. Studies that purposely restricted calories in the intermittent fasting group were excluded.
Animal trials
Energy intake and body composition
A total of 36 studies were found. When an alternate-day fasting diet is implemented, overall calorie restriction and weight reduction occurs in most rodent species, indicating that the restriction on the fasting day isn’t compensated fully on feasting days when food is offered ad libitum (18-34). Consequently, alternate-day fasting is a widely used model for studying the effects of calorie restriction in rodent species (15). This however is not a universal finding and numerous studies have reported no alterations in energy intake and body weight (17,35-39). In general, studies using Sprague-Dawley and Wistar rats show decreased energy intake and reduced body weights (15,25). However, C57BL/6 mice maintained on the same alternate-day fasting regimen consume similar food quantities in a 48-hour time period and maintain body weights similar to that of mice fed ad libitum (17). The effect of intermittent fasting on body weight thus seems largely dependent on the animal genotype but could also be affected by the age of initiation, with optimal age varying in the various rodent strains (40).
Modified alternate-day fasting is one alternative model sometimes used in the intermittent fasting research. In this model, the animals are not completely fasted every other day, but allowed a small energy intake of 15-25% of the daily intake consumed by ad libitum fed animals. Modified alternate-day fasting could allow for better maintenance of body weight than true alternate-day fasting protocols (a complete every other day fast) (30,38). The complete compensation and increased energy intake does not appear to be dependent on the calorie density of the food, since neither a high-fat or low-fat 85% modified alternate-day fasting diet alters body weight compared to ad libitum feeding over a four week period (41).
Total body weight however does not reflect alterations in body composition, and there could be changes in lean mass to fat mass ratio or altered fat distribution which of course would not be reflected in the animal’s body weight alone. Alterations in fat distribution were demonstrated in one study in which mice on both true and modified alternate-day fasting diets showed a redistribution of adipose tissue from visceral to subcutaneous depots without altering body weight overall (39).
Cardiovascular health
Four rodent studies that examined the effect of alternate-day fasting on cardiovascular disease were included. In general, rats maintained on an alternate-day fasting regimen lose bodyweight and display reduced blood pressure and heart rate, and improved insulin sensitivity, compared to rats fed ad libitum (28,29,42). Reduced blood pressure was also demonstrated in diabetic rats, proposing that alternate-day fasting can have a preventive effect on the progression of diabetes nephropathy (32).This data is suggesting that intermittent fasting may reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.
Furthermore, when myocardial infarction was induced in rats maintained on an alternate-day fasting diet, reduced infarction size, improved cardiac function, and increased survival was observed, compared to rats fed ad libitum (24,33,43). More interestingly, the effects on infarction size, survival rates and cardiac function can be observed even if the dietary intervention is induced after the ischemic event, by increasing the expression of angiogenic factors and increased vascularization of the damaged myocardium, proposing a novel non-pharmacological therapy for subjects with chronic heart failure (43).
A possible contributing factor for the cardio protective effects of intermittent fasting is increased levels of adiponectin, a hormone that exhibits both anti-athrogenic and insulin sensitizing effects and has been shown to protect cardiac myocytes against ischemic injury (44,45). Interestingly, alternate-day fasting demonstrates increased adiponectin levels in numerous rodent studies, even in the absence of calorie restriction and weight loss (39,46).
Glucose metabolism
A total of seven studies were found. Increased insulin sensitivity, as indicated by decreased fasting concentrations of glucose and insulin, has been demonstrated in rodents on alternate-day fasts both with (19,28,33) and without (17) decreased calorie intake. Anson et al. showed that mice on alternate-day fasting regimen who consume the same amount of food in a 48-hour period as mice fed ad libitum, decreased glucose and insulin concentrations to a similar degree as did mice on daily calorie restriction despite maintained energy intake and body weight (17). In another study, as little as two 24 hour fasts per week, without calorie reduction overall, were sufficient to improve insulin sensitivity in mice (46). In diabetic rats, alternate-day fasting reduces blood pressure, normalizes HDL levels, protects against glomerular damage and prevents development of diabetes nephropathy (32). These findings suggest beneficial effects on glucose metabolism and improved markers associated with obesity and the metabolic syndrome.
Brain pathology
A total of 17 studies were included. Numerous aspects of intermittent fasting and neuronal health have been examined in rodent species. Compared to rats fed ad libitum, alternate day fasted rats showed protection of age-related changes in dendritic spine number and morphology (20). Other rodent experiments have showed increased neurogenesis in brains of rats maintained on an alternate-day fasting diet, as evident by increased number of newly generated neural cells in the hippocampus (21). These results suggest that intermittent fasting could hinder morphological neuronal changes seen with normal aging and could thus slow down the neuronal aging process. Other observed effects in mice include increased synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus and enhancement of learning abilities and other cognitive functions (47).
Intermittent fasting potentially exhibits desirable effects in manifest neuronal diseases. Rats maintained on alternate-day fasting diets show reduced brain damage and mortality rate in rodent models of stroke (19,31). After a period of 2–4 months on alternate-day fasting, a neuroprotective effect against induced hippocampal excitotoxic damage was observed (25). Epileptic seizures in animals maintained on an alternate-day fasting diet lead to decreased brain damage (22,26,34). Beneficial effects have been demonstrated in animal models of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s (25,48) and Parkinson’s (18) disease. Furthermore, in an animal model of Huntington’s disease, prolonged survival, reduced disease-associated weight loss and improved motor function was observed in animals on an alternate-day fasting diet compared to animals fed ad libitum (49). Interestingly, the protective effect of intermittent fasting against induced excitotoxic brain damage has been demonstrated in mice despite no reduction in calorie intake or weight loss. Furthermore, mice on alternate-day fasting diets showed greater resistance to excitotoxic injury than mice on daily, controlled calorie restriction (17).
When mice with progressive demyelinating disorders of the peripheral nervous system were put on an alternate-day fasting diet regime, hampered disease progression was observed as indicated by improved nerve morphology and performance compared to mice fed ad libitum (37). Furthermore, alternate-day fasting leads to increased functional recovery after experimentally induced spinal cord injuries in rats, independently if the alternate-day fasting regimen is implemented prior or after the spinal cord is injured (27,50). If this effect is demonstrated in humans, intermittent fasting could potentially serve as a non-pharmacological therapeutic alternative in the rehabilitation process in subjects with spinal cord injuries. The effect in mice was greater with alternate-day fasting compared to daily calorie restriction, suggesting that increased time span in the fasted state has additive effects other than those attributed to calorie restriction alone (27).
The beneficial effect does however not appear universal to all neurologic disorders. No desirable effect was observed in an animal model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), indicating that intermittent fasting has no beneficial effect on the development of this motor neuron disease (51).
Cell proliferation and cancer
To study the potential anti-carcinogenic effect of intermittent fasting, three different aspects of tumorgenesis have been studied: circulating markers of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), cell proliferation rates, and direct effect of intermittent fasting on carcinogenesis in animal models. Seven studies were included.
Subjects with elevated IGF-1 levels have been reported to exhibit increased risk of several cancer types. Furthermore, high circulating levels of insulin and IGF-1 in combination are often seen in subjects with obesity, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, patient categories that are also more likely to be affected by cancers (52). Rats on alternate-day fasting diets showed decreased levels of IGF-1 and proliferation rates of T-cells and prostate cells (30). Cell proliferation rates are considered a central element in the development of cancers (53). Decreased cell proliferation has previously been demonstrated with reduced feeding frequency alone, despite matched calorie intake (54). Mice put on a 85% modified alternate-day fast (eating 15% of ad libitum daily energy intake on fasting days) reduced IGF-1 levels and decreased proliferation rates of epidermal, prostate, splenic T and liver cells, despite no weight change (41). In a third study, true but not modified alternate-day fasting decreased IGF-1 levels in mice. Cell proliferation rates were however reduced in both groups, even in the absence of weight loss (38).
There is however some conflicting data in regard to intermittent fasting and IGF-1. Two 24 hour fasts/week without overall calorie restriction showed increased levels of IGF-1 and no effects on tumor size or survival in rats with prostate cancer (46). One might suspect that two 24 hour fasts per week would be insufficient to exhibit the anti-carcinogenic effects. However, Anson et al. displayed increased levels of IGF-1 in mice on alternate-day fasting diets with maintained body weight compared to controls, in contrast to mice on daily calorie restriction who showed decreases in bodyweight and decreased IGF-1 (17). The authors suggested a difference in the way intermittent fasting and calorie restriction influence the growth hormone -IGF-1 axis and insulin signaling pathways. The relevance of IGF-1 for tumor growth in intermittently fasted animals, with or without calorie restriction remains thus a subject for further clarification.
Recent research has also examined intermittent fasting and its direct effect on tumor development. OF1 is a strain of mice that spontaneously develops age related lymphomas at a high rate. In a 16 week trial, none of the mice of this particular strain fed on alternate days developed lymphomas compared to 33% of mice in the control group fed ad libitum (36). There was no difference in food intake or body weight between the two groups, suggesting that intermittent fasting has a protective effect on lymphoma development in this mouse strain, and that the effect was independent of the total calorie intake. The effect of intermittent fasting on induced hepatocarcinogenesis has also been examined. When rats were put on a 48 hour fasting regimen once per week, they developed less preneoplastic lesions compared to rats fed ad libitum over a 48 week period (55). The effects of shorter, more frequent fasts, such as alternate-day fasting on hepatocarcinogenesis remains a subject for future research.
Consequently, studies to date indicate that intermittent fasting hampers cell proliferation rates in a variety of cell types, and that it could potentially protect against direct development of some cancer types.
Life span
Two studies looked at survival per se. They propose that animals on alternate-day fasting diets increase life span compared to those fed ad libitum (15,40). The magnitude of life span enhancement seems to be dependent on animal strain and age of initiation (40). Furthermore, in one study, only rats on alternate-day fasting diets survived to 30 months of age compared to a mean lifespan of 22-24 months for rats fed ad libitum (20).
It is merely speculative if the effect on longevity is secondary to the above described effects such as decreased body weight, improved insulin sensitivity, improved cardiovascular health, decreased tumor growth and improved neuronal health, or if intermittent fasting might have some distinctive effect on the aging process. No study to date has specifically studied the effect of intermittent fasting without calorie restriction on lifespan, although the effects that have been described are expected to increase life span. Interestingly, the largest magnitude of life span expansion (25 percent increase in mean life span) is seen in C57BL/6J mice, the same strain that in many of the studies on alternate-day fasting maintain a constant total energy intake and body weight (40).
Other effects
Some other interesting effects than the primary addressed in this review were observed in various studies. (56). Another surprising finding in rats maintained on intermittent fasting is increased testicular mass and testosterone/estrogen ratio compared to control rats or rats on a calorie restriction diet (57). Analgesia, which may be attributed to negative modulation of synaptic transmission in nociceptive neurons in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, has also been reported in rats maintained on an alternate-day fasting diet (35). This finding opens up the question whether intermittent fasting alone or in combination with a pharmacological agent could serve as a useful new therapeutic approach for treating pain.
Human studies
The Ramadan fast
Fasting is one of the five pillars of Islam. During the holy month of Ramadan, Muslims restrain from fluid and food intake during daytime for the whole month. Worldwide, there are more than one billion Muslims, of whom the majority fast annually (58). The holy month of Ramadan could thus potentially be a good period to study prolonged short term intermittent fasting in humans on a large scale. A total of 17 studies were found. Conclusions are however very hard to draw from these studies. Apart from the obvious difficulties with doing randomized controlled trials there is a number of confounding factors (59,60). Such confounding variables include:
- Altered food choices and macronutrient distribution during the fasting month
- Dehydration and the difficulties with reliable lab tests
- Changes in activity patterns
- Reduced sleep due to nighttime eating and socializing
- Differences in fasting length and hydration status in different geographical locations and time of year
Furthermore, the studies were generally of poor study design with few participants and lack of control group. As a result the studies are highly inconclusive with the effects on body weight and blood lipids with some studies showing unchanged body weight (59,61) while others show weight loss (62). Therefore, no objective conclusions could be made about this type of short term intermittent fasting and cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors, and further research of higher quality is warranted.
In one observational study, young competitive soccer players were sent to a training camp 3 week’s prior to, and during, the Ramadan fast. The fasting participants were compared to the non-fasting participants and all food was delivered from the same kitchen, thus eliminating some of the confounding factors above (60,63). Apart from a small difference in body weight (0,7 kg) that could be explained by hydration status between the two groups, no differences were observed in blood glucose levels, hematocrit, cortisol levels, inflammation markers or physical performance. In another study, fasting healthy men and women were compared to a matched non-fasting group with regard to inflammation markers and blood lipid status (61). No differences were observed in body weight, total cholesterol, triglycerides or LDL levels. There was however an increase in HDL levels and decreased inflammation – proposing a beneficial effect in the fasted subjects.
Thus, there are some data suggesting altered health markers during the month of Ramadan, but more research is needed if any objective conclusions about this type of intermittent fasting and the factors studied in this review ought to be drawn.
Alternate-day fasting
To date, very few human intervention studies have tried to replicate the reported effects of alternate-day fasting seen in rodent studies. Only six such studies were found, with somewhat disappointing study designs (64-69). The sample size in these studies was rather small, ranging from eight to sixteen participants, and the study period was often very short. Only one trial included a control group. The results are summarized in Table 2.
In both true alternate-day fasting trials, a decreased body weight was observed (66,67). In modified alternate-day fasting trials, maintained bodyweight was observed in lean (65,69) but not obese (64,68) subjects. In obese subjects, a modified 8-10 week alternate-day fasting regimen resulted in weight loss, reduced blood pressure and heart rate, and improved markers for cardiovascular health, such as decreased total cholesterol, decreased LDL and triglycerides, increased HDL concentrations and decreased oxidative stress and systemic inflammation, suggesting that alternate-day fasting might be a novel strategy for decreasing body weight and improving cardiovascular health in the obese population (64,68).
To examine the effects of alternate-day fasting on glucose metabolism, eight healthy men were maintained on a 20h modified alternate-day fast for two weeks. Despite unaltered body weight and habitual physical activity, insulin dependent glucose uptake increased, and increased adiponectin levels were observed (65). In another trial, the insulin sensitizing effect of true alternate-day fasting was observed through reduced insulin response to a standardized meal in men, but not women – suggesting a potential sex difference in the effect of alternate-day fasting on glucose metabolism (66). Although not demonstrated in all human studies (68,69), these results indicate that alternate-day fasting might mimic the insulin sensitizing effects observed in rodents on alternate-day fasting diet, and that the effect might be due to increased adiponectin levels.
Sex differences were also observed in another study where healthy men and women were fasted on alternate days. In this study, HDL levels were increased in women only, and triglycerides were decreased in men but not women (67). Increased insulin sensitivity was suggested by decreased insulin levels with unaltered glucose levels. In this study, blood pressure was unaltered, but the study duration was merely 22 days. In contrast, one trial showed decreased blood pressure and resting heart rates in subjects on modified alternate-day fasting regimens for 10 weeks, suggesting that longer intervention periods might be needed for this effect to occur (64). There is, however, conflicting data from another study that utilized a two week crossover study design and randomized eight healthy men to a modified alternate-day fasting diet or a standard diet. No differences were observed in body weight, blood lipids, glucose metabolism or hormone levels, and there was a decrease in energy expenditure after the 2 week period in the alternate-day fasting group (69). More controlled studies, with larger sample sizes and longer study durations are thus needed to bring clarification in this matter.
No human trial has directly examined intermittent fasting and tumor physiology. A single two day fast increases endogenous GH-production fivefold, reflecting the metabolic adaptation to fasting, including increased hepatic glucose production, lipolysis and nitrogen conservation (70). However no significant changes in IGF-1 are seen after a single fast period in human subjects, suggesting that repeated fasts and longer intervention periods might be necessary to mimic the changes in IGF-1 and altered cancer growth observed in some rat studies. Whether a prolonged alternate-day fasting regimen can alter IGF-1 levels in humans remains an area for future research. Furthermore, no human trials to date have examined the effects of intermittent fasting on neuronal health or life span.
Mechanisms of calorie restriction and intermittent fasting
The exact mechanism by which calorie restriction and intermittent fasting exhibits its effects on various organ systems remains unknown. The main hypothesis includes a stress preconditioning response mechanism, in which it is believed that periods of nutrient deprivation displays a beneficial mild stress that results in molecular adaptive changes in various tissues, which increases the organism’s resistance to bigger stressors such as excitotoxic and oxidative injury, including ischemia (33,71). Alternating periods of anabolism and catabolism during intermittent fasting might further increase the cellular stress resistance. Other displayed effects are increased production of neutrophilic factors and antioxidant enzymes, ketone body formation and altered metabolism enzyme production (5).
Potential adverse effects from fasting
Blood glucose levels, mood and cognition
A variety of questions often arises when discussing intermittent fasting and human health. It is often believed that blood sugar levels will fall to pathological levels if prolonged fasts are implemented. A characteristic decline in mood and energy levels before lunch among humans is often attributed to a drop in blood sugar. However when actually testing blood sugar levels in healthy subjects prone to this phenomena, no actual decline in blood sugar to pathologic levels was seen during a 24 hour fast (72). In healthy human subjects, a 24 hour fast decreases liver glycogen stores no more than 57% and in absence of vigorous exercise does not lead to muscle glycogen consumption, suggesting that liver glycogen stores are sufficient after a 24 hour fast to keep blood glucose levels within normal range (73). interplay between these and other endocrine signaling systems and its effect on body weight regulation and subjective feelings of hunger and satiety remains largely unknown. The hunger response however seems to be highly adaptive in different meal patterns. Ghrelin, a gut derived hormone, is considered a meal-initiation signal. It increases during fasting and usually peaks in concentration before an anticipated meal, paired with increased feelings of hunger, and decreases after feeding. Interestingly, the rise in ghrelin is independent of meal timing as demonstrated by similar peaks before an anticipated meal in various meal frequencies, thus suggesting that subjective feelings of hunger and energy intake is highly dependent on the individual’s preferred meal pattern (76).
Increases in subjective feelings of hunger might be the single most important factor to consider when discussing the applicability of intermittent fasting as a therapeutic or preventive intervention in human subjects. In obese patients, a 14 day total fast lead to strikingly decreased body weights and decreased blood pressure, without causing increased hunger sensations. Thus a hunger suppressing effect of prolonged fasting was demonstrated (77). This anorexic effect might be attributed to the evolutionary purpose of seeking for nutrients in absence of food. The experiment, dating back to 1962, was effective and well tolerated.
Only one study has directly examined the feelings of hunger and fullness in non-obese subjects on an intermittent fasting diet, by using a 100 mm visual analog scale (67). The subjects were fasted on alternate days and reported an increased feeling of hunger from 37 to 56 mm and decrease in feeling of fullness from 43 to 23 mm when the dietary intervention was initiated. The magnitude of hunger did however not change during the intervention period as repeated measurements were taken, and feelings of fullness actually increased some over time. The duration of this study was only 22 days and it is still purely speculative whether and adaptation to the new meal pattern would occur in a longer time span. In contrast, modified alternate-day fasting in obese asthmatic patients did not significantly increase the subjective perception of hunger from baseline during the eight week long intervention period (68).
Whether repeated bouts of short term fasting can alter hunger hormone signaling or demonstrate the same anorexic effect as the long term fast described above is highly speculative and an interesting area for future research.
Decreased metabolic rate
It is commonly believed that multiple small meals increase metabolism and lead to increased overall energy expenditure. Following every meal there is an increase in expenditure due to the processing of the nutrients, commonly referred to Thermic Effect of Food (TEF) (78). A common belief therefore is that increased meal frequency leads to increased TEF and increased overall energy expenditure with multiple meals, and that intermittent fasting accordingly would decrease metabolic rate and lead to increased fat accumulation and possibly obesity. According to current research though, TEF is proportional to the calorie content and vary with macronutrient composition (with the highest increase in energy expenditure observed with a high protein diet) and not meal frequency per se, as demonstrated by the equal TEF in different meal patterns under iso-caloric conditions (79,80). Furthermore, one study examined alterations in resting metabolic rate in human subjects on alternate-day fasting diets, and found no changes after a 22 day period (67). According to these findings, any potential decreases in metabolic rate would be due to decreased total calorie intake and not fasting per se.
Increased stress
Increased levels of both ACTH and corticosteroids can be noted in rodents maintained on alternate-day fasting diets compared with rats fed ad libitum (28,29,42). Apart from the obvious notion that cortisol is one of the major hormones responsible for glucose utilization during fasting, the question arises whether the increased stress in any way could be harmful to the human organism. The molecular stress response in intermittently fasted subjects seems markedly different from the one associated with uncontrolled stress. In fasted rodents there is actually a down regulation of glucocorticoid receptors in the brain, with maintained expression of mineralocorticoid receptors, suggesting that fasting might alter the brain’s responsiveness to glucocorticoids (81). In contrast, in uncontrolled stress, down regulation of the mineral corticoid receptor has been noted. Furthermore, deleterious stress responses are associated with a decrease in the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a response quite the opposite of calorie restriction and intermittent fasting, where increased concentrations of BDNF have been observed in numerous studies (4). In conclusion, the controlled stress response from intermittent fasting seems fundamentally different from the one by uncontrolled physiological and psychological stress. Conversely, In line with the mechanisms described above, the increased stress might be one of the necessary factors for initiating molecular resistance for larger stressors, and thus promote some of the beneficial effects of intermittent fasting.
Loss of muscle mass
One potential serious side effect of intermittent fasting would be loss of muscle mass. Theoretically, food deprivation would result in depleted hepatic glycogen stores, leading to increased proteolysis and flux of amino acids from skeletal muscle for hepatic de novo gluconeogenesis, to maintain healthy blood glucose concentrations. As discussed previously though, a 24 hour short term fast is insufficient in duration to deplete liver glycogen stores in healthy subjects (73). Up to 40 hours of total fasting does not stimulate catabolic processes and lead to skeletal muscle atrophy (82). Modified alternate-day fasting and loss of lean body mass was investigated in only one study in the systematic search. No loss of fat free mass in the absence of weight loss was observed compared to a control group fed a standardized diet (69). Furthermore, an increase in ketone body concentrations has been observed in subjects on alternate-day fasting diets in both human and animal studies (17,68). Ketone bodies spare skeletal muscle from breakdown by providing non-glucose energy substrate for various tissues, of which the brain is the most important, and thus decrease the need for protein-derived substrates for gluconeogenetic conversion to maintain glucose homeostasis (83). Available data thus suggests that short term fasting does not deplete hepatic glycogen stores to the extent that markedly increased proteolysis and gluconeogenesis becomes necessary to maintain healthy glucose concentrations. Still this notion needs to be clarified in future research of longer duration.
Conclusions
Alternate day fasting as a model for calorie restriction
Intermittent fasting in the form of alternate day fasting in many instances reduces overall energy intake, with no obvious adverse effects, and thus becomes a model of calorie restriction in both human and animal subjects. Secondary to reduced energy intake and weight loss, effects such as reduced risk factors for cardiovascular disease, and improved glucose metabolism have been demonstrated in both animal and human subjects on true and modified alternate-day fasting diets.
In rats, protection against ischemic injury and improved survival has been demonstrated in both myocardial and cerebral ischemic events. Other beneficial effects, such as slowing the neuronal aging process and increasing cognitive functions and memory, have been observed. In line with animal studies on daily calorie restriction, alternate-day calorie restriction has shown beneficial effects in neuronal disorders such as stroke, epilepsy and neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and Huntington’s disease. Additionally, calorie restriction can reduce cancer risk and increase life span in rodent models on alternate-day fasting diets.
Intermittent fasting and health in the absence of calorie restriction
Some effects occur even if the subject maintains body weight, suggesting that the reduced meal frequency or prolonged time in the fasted state might have some additional effects regardless of overall calorie restriction and weight loss. In humans, modified alternate-day fasting diets might be easier to adhere to and they seemingly lead to less pronounced weight loss than true alternate-day fasting. Without causing weight loss, effects such as improved fasting insulin have been demonstrated in both animals and humans. In line with these findings, adiponectin increases in rats and humans on both true and modified alternate-day fasting diets in the absence of calorie restriction. Additionally, in mice, fat redistribution from visceral to subcutaneous stores has been observed despite unaltered overall body weight. If this effect proves to be true in human subjects it could propose reduced disease risk despite unaltered body weight.
Animal data further indicate some beneficial effects of intermittent fasting diets even without calorie restriction. Neuronal health improvements such as resistance to excitotoxic injury have been observed. Resistance to oxidative stress could be beneficial in the pathogenesis of epilepsy and various neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease. Alternate-day fasting in animals also leads to improved recovery after induced spinal cord injuries and progressive demyelinating disease of the peripheral nervous system, in the absence of calorie restriction. Furthermore, in animal studies, changes associated with retareded tumorgenesis, such as decreased cell proliferation rates in various cell lines and decreased incidence of lymphoma, have been observed. Whether these observations are valid in human subjects as well remains an interesting area for future research.
Future research is warranted to test whether the health promoting effects described in animal studies have some validity in humans. We are in the very infancy of research on intermittent fasting in human subjects and future studies with larger sample sizes, longer durations and of better study design must be completed before any definite conclusions can be made regarding intermittent fasting and human health and the applicability to modern lifestyle.

Very interesting stuff, I love that even though some of the references were a bit over my head (the latin names for some illnessess and the implications of these, etc) most of it was completely comprehensible eventhough it was made for medical purposes.
You are one helluva writer Bojan, thanks for sharing this.
Thanks for sharing! Congrats on your MD status.
Wow…that is a lot of work. Thanks for sharing. Been IF for 2 days a week for a year.
Great summary of some of the work that has been done to date. Some more recent studies showing timing (i.e. dinner instead of breakfast) may be more beneficial (Kahleova et al., 2014; Fernemark et al., 2013; see for nice summary). Keep up the nice work.
Fantastic job! I’ve been doing leangains for almost 2 years and love it! Appreciate you (and Berkhan) sharing your work with us!
Thanks for taking the time to write this up, Bojan. It was a very nice, in-depth look at the studies surrounding IF and written in a way that can appeal to the medical-savvy people, and the general public interested in health like myself. Appreciate the hard work you’ve put into this, and let’s hope there’s some proper, high quality studies done on IF in humans in the years to come!
There used to be a time when people were trained to write and communicate, and from the above article this time has clearly passed.
Too long, too much jargon, entire paragraphs that don’t move the topic forward, and worst of all-the important stuff (the “lead”) is so buried and muddled that it was just confusing. I can see that you are using this article to try to bring people in and eventually sell them something. The way you are approaching it wont work-unless you really think people are going to read 10,000 words of science crap instead of just closing your site and going elsewhere. Just sayin’the truth.
Obviously, you’ve never read a peer-reviewed journal article before. While it may seem like jargon to you, it is the preferred lexicon for scholarly publications. Also, “just sayin'” is an absolutely douchey thing to say.
With all due respect Jeff, this is a thesis paper and by you saying that it’s too long with too much jargon is a statement of your lack of education. This is proper academia and if you can’t digest this then that is truly unfortunate.
Oh dear Jeff, you have clearly shown that this level of academia is lost on you. He isn’t trying to sell you anything lol, this is his thesis that he has kindly shared (not a fitness blog from a run-of-the-mill personal trainer), of which the ‘scientific jargon’ is absolutely necessary. This is an excellent review of the available literature, written by a highly educated person. This is an extremely disrespectful comment that shows your lack of intelligence. I’m a little embarrassed for you. Think things through before you comment in future.
This study confirms much of the anecdotal evidence that I had already heard about the possible long-term effects of intermittent fasting. I’m delighted and relieved to now know that although it may be an unconventional weight loss method for many people, it isn’t harmful.
Thanks! Amazing work.
Interesting timing of this post as I was just talking with a co-worker about the benefits of intermittent fasting and the general practice of fasting.
Although it has been a while (many years)since I have practiced fasting, it is a ritual that I have studied and used its healthy benefits in the past. I have used short fasts of less than 36 hours and longer fasts of 7 days for personal research,purposes and practice.
After having lived several years in an unhealthy way, I have re-tooled my lifestyle into a sustainable healthy way of living and have lost 55 pounds in the past year. The subject of intermittent fasting came up as I believe that I will begin a regular practice of IF as a part of this lifestyle.
I am looking forward the time when I can read your complete work as I have only scanned it this morning.
Thanks for sharing your work with me.

Thank you for sharing your research. The popular models of IF being 5:2 with the 2 days being 500 calories a day and 18:6 (over a 24 hr period) have received a lot if attention. Do you have any results on their benefits from your research?
I need to leave a quick comment just as I started reading
The best and biggest recource base for the IF is by far Martin Berkhan, and his website leangains.com, not Brad Pilon, whose book is good, to be fair. Now back to the reading…
Oh god, sorry, I’ve posted that comment before reading the next sentence, ignore that
It is a great summary and I do appreciate your work on this. However, I wanted to ask whether you came upon studies that researched IF’s effects on female reproductive health? I’ve seen anecdotal articles in blogosphere where women claim that IF has destroyed their hormone profiles and thus reproductive health and this was the reason I went off IF at some point, just in case. Still, I’ve kept on being curious about it, but haven’t found evidence in either direction about it.
Thanks for sharing this. I have been practicing IF (Leangains) for a bit over a year now, and I’m also a type one Diabetic. I’m curious about the effects and benefits of insulin sensitivity on a type one Diabetic with fasting? It seems like most of the research in this area has been done on type two Diabetics. Has there been any research and/or findings in regards to fasting and type one Diabetes?
Hello Boyan,
I’d like to know if you have some data on how Intermittent Fasting acts on libido.
Thanks in advance
Thank you for putting in the work that I don’t have the stamina for. Great work!
Great article, also a big fan of Martin’s site and message. However, as someone who has been an IFer for seven years, Ori Hofmekler (author of the Warrior Diet) deserves lots of credit for the IF movement.
Ori may in fact be the first well-known proponent of IF and Warrior Diet should be recognized as one of original mainstream publications advocating IF for general health and physique improvements…
Great article. I spend much of my time researching information on fasting from peer reviewed journals through my university. I find the health benefits of IF, especially autophagy, are profound but tend to be poorly understood. I have the article you posted. You may also want to look at a review article “Effects of Diet on Brain Plasticity in Animal and Human Studies: Mind the Gap” by Tytus Murphy et al at King’s College London published May 12 2014. Cheers.
Thank you for sharing, quite extensive work I must say.
It would be interesting to understand how fasting affects our hormone profile, and as lads primarily testosterone (you do mention testosterone/estrogen ratios) and growth hormone. Perhaps there is not enough research, perhaps I would just need a more “layman-like” explanation. What do you know about this topic?
Again, thank you for sharing.
Lots of writing but I was conflicted.. You talked in the beginning about this being your baby.. and how you didn’t even care to share it for a while because of the pride of piecing it together.. but then after reading it, it’s just a collection of all previously released studied and ideas. You made it sound like you had stumbled on some gold nuggets of previously unknown information. By the time the end finally arrives, there’s nothing new at all and even the idea of IF being superior is still in question.
Nice resource of information overall but I still fail to understand why so many people regard IF as some unique idea or think of it as a new way to solve an old problem. I tried it for a full year before realizing that my results were identical to when I ate 6 meals a day for a decade. Is it staving off disease in me a little longer and giving me a future benefit in that respect? Possibly but not conclusively.
In the end.. it’s still all just calories in/out and and IF is just a fancy term for not eating all damn day. It matters little and this just seems to justify that. I’ll continue to be blown away by people who so firmly believe eating all their food in an 8 hour window is greatly affecting their body composition. It ain’t. Eat 6 meals if you like or eat 1 or 2. It matters not.
All that said.. great work putting this much information together. I can see great benefit in people linking to the article as a place to find many important studies on fasting.
I don’t understand how a 24-hour fast for a human (about a 70-90 year lifespan) is comparable to a 24-hour fast for a lab mouse/rat which lives 2-3 years. Wouldn’t a human need to fast for 30 days or more?
Most appreciate the hard work, and you choosing to publish this free for all to read and benefit after the hours of work. Will put several links up to it.
You’re open to questions or sick of the subject by now?
A great article and a good read, appreciate all the hard work put into it, thanks.
I’ve read everything on IF and this is decent. I did it when it was called Animalbolics, that’s Pre Warrior Diet stuff.
I especially liked the differentiation between normal stress and the stress of fasting because that’s basically the biggest argument against IF right now.
It is true that junk food can totally screw up any health benefits of IF and the people that bash it did just that, or did unhealthy low carb or too low calorie or had lots of stress in other areas of life.
IF can also backfire if done to extreme. I’ve seen some very smart people do an extreme version of IF (like 1 meal a day for 6 months) and then bash it then go back to 6 meals a day. I mean come on. On the other hand I don’t believe one 24 hour fast a week is enough either but it doesn’t matter what I believe, what matters is you doing what you feel like doing.
You can skip breakfast, push lunch back a few hours and skip the late night snack and you are automatically doing IF/8 Hour diet, the diet that Wolverine did for his last 3 movies so there is something more to the equation than just IF.
IF is the only diet that allows me to eat white bread and pasta everyday and get the same results I got when I ate MUCH more strict and have a normal life and no one even knows I’m dieting at all when they see me eat. That’s NICE because I can’t stand talking diets with “muggles.”
Thank you for all the work of putting it together! If you don’t mind, couple of quick questions.
From perspective of
1. Mood and energy
2. Long-term health and longevity
3. Physical and mental performance
All other things being equal, according to current data, should someone training two or three times a week fast once a week for the whole day or daily for about 14-16 hours?
Also, assuming the three days workout regimen (Mon, Wed, Fri) or two days workout regimen (Mon and Fri) what would be the best day to fast to get most of the benefits and sacrifice as little anabolism as possible? Thanks a lot!
Thank you for sharing it! Is there any scientific evidence to support the answer to this question?
What of the following types of fasting should one do if he or she is not interested in weight loss (but rather muscle gain), but is very interested in all other health benefits fasting might provide and specifically in the benefit below (related to glomerulosclerosis) as this one can be life-saving(!)?
1. Intermittent fasting daily
1.1 No food food for 16 hours a day
1.2 No protein and no carbs for 16 hours a day, but some fat for breakfast
2. Alternate day fasting
2.1 No calories on a given day – one day a week
2.2 No calories on a given day – two days a week
2.3 No calories on a given day – every other day — this seems to be the method of the discussed rat study (below)
2.4 Limited calories on a given day (max 800) – one day a week
2.5 Limited calories on a given day (max 800) – two days a week
2.6 Limited calories on a given day (max 800) – every other day.

Is there anything else to keep read and keep in mind?
Thank you again!
Incredible article! Although scientific in its approach, quite accessible to the rest of us to understand and assimilate.
Congratulations on your MD!
I try most days, to push back my eating widow – not for reasons of IF, but usually because I just can’t be bothered to eat… Or I’m lazy. Or busy. And i don’t know i want because really I don’t fancy anything.
I can usually go to somewhere between 2 -4 pm. But should I push it too long – I often do! – I start to get shakey, nauseaus, and feeling terrible…
It’s interesting that you mentioned blood glucose levels, because that’s what I’ve long thought it was. But if it’s not!? What is causing it?!
My husband goes even longer than I do, but he never has the same shaky feelings.
It’s been much better for me since giving up most sugar and adopting a paleo style diet. But yeah, if I go too long, it’s awful…
The symptoms you describe are associated with detoxing. You say the better your diet the less you experience them. This is key. The quality of your food matters, as the more toxins your body has to eliminate the more symptoms you will feel during your food-free periods. You should be able to push through these symptoms and stretch the length of time without food.
“Toxins”? Oh no, you sound like a fucking Food Babe army ‘tard. Disregard this comment, all.
Great research! I certainly appreciate a scientific paper on weight loss versus the advertisement-laced, fad based articles. As a woman, I am curious about the physiological/hormonal differences between males and females and does IF effect genders differently? I noticed when mentioning research you state “humans” or “rodents” but do not specify whether males or females, or a combination of both, were used. (Unless, I didn’t read carefully enough, if so, I apologize.) I have read articles that state while research shows benefits for male subjects (rodent and human alike), that longer periods of fasting were detrimental for females. I’ve also heard there isn’t enough research on females to draw a conclusion.
If anyone has insight on this topic, I’d be very appreciative to hear it.
I would say that besides the fact that ketones spare lean tissue, there’s also the effect of growth hormone that prevents the loss of muscle under IF routine. what do you think?
this is even more interesting in subjects (like me) who do not lose muscle on 48+ hours IF under very low carb ketogenic diets where glycogen storage is significantly reduced.
thoughts?
Very informative article. I started practicing Martin’s leangains style intermittent fasting about 6 months ago and its my life style now. Already lost 28 lbs and broke all my personal best in the major lifts.
Thank you for sharing your hard work.
Such great work that you are sharing with us!
A phenomenal read. Gave you a little shout-out on my site:
Keep up the great work!
Great read Bojan, thank you for posting it online. I especially liked the section regarding the Ramadan fast. And congratulations on your MD!
thank you! very good very interesting, muchas gracias! a great start for a promising topic in future nutrition!
Great work. I personally feel that IF has changed my life, and taught me what it really means to be hungry as opposed to just “time to eat.” After being exposed to LeanGains several years ago I begain doing a 16hr daily fast, just by skipping breakfast and avoiding late night snacking. It’s had minimal impact on my lifestyle, and adjusting to the no breakfast, no snacking ways were easy, because after only a few days of that I no longer felt hungry during the fasting period. While I’m still not as lean as I’d like to be, I began IF right about the same time I got out of the Army, and my activity levels decreased tremendously, yet thanks to IF I’ve gotten somewhat leaner and significantly decreased my food intake with minimal effort. I’ve also managed to gain plenty of muscle on IF through macro-cycling as described by Martin. I’m terribly undisciplined and my motivation ebs and flows throughout the year, but despite all that IF has been a very positive thing in my life. Oh, my blood work looks incredible as well, with my total cholesterol in the 180s despite very high HDL and my triglycerides in the mid 50s. Plus my blood pressure has decreased over the years from 200/120 at its peak, to currently sitting at 125/75 with no medication. Thanks guys. Your research changes lives. – Ben
This was incredibly well written, fascinating and informative.. That day has finally come, it seems my fear of disappointment was just stopping me from looking a little harder. What’s more, you did it for free! I sincerely hope you are being fairly compensated for this gem that I will be keeping in my ‘understanding humanity’ arsenal alongside V.S Ramachandran, Dawkins and the Lancet Journal. Thank you, can’t wait to read more.
Brilliant article. I met a trainer who has a giant of a sculpted body. He told me something about slingshot training which was based on eating and fasting cycles. He said the body releases growth hormones when we fast. I didn’t quite understand the concept then. Now it makes heck of a sense.
Also, while fasting during Ramadan is mandatory, it is encouraged among Muslims to fast every Monday and Thursday. Very few people do it however. Like most good things in life.
“O ye who believe! Fasting is prescribed to you as it was prescribed to those before you, that ye may (learn) self-restraint. And that you fast, it is better for you if only you know” – The Cow-verse 183- 184
Thank you so much for sharing. I have been studying fasting for years on my own body as well as teaching it to others. I love the idea of IF because it is more doable than prolonged fasts and doesn’t interfere with ones work life/energy levels in general.
Great research! I hope you write a book some day
Great stuff, though a PDF would be nice.
Thanks for sharing the stuff, Bojan!!
I really appreciate not having to immerse myself in a stack of papers to understand some of the real science beyond IF.
I don’t think IF is a shortcut to perfect health and body, specially if you are fed up with crap when not fasting, but it really seems a useful tool to promote optimal health.
I’ve read some biologist claiming that nature provides us with the perfect fasting environment: darkness. Just studies in rodents by now.
Muscle loss.
With increased ketones due to short period fasting and Preventing the loss of non fat mass.
Can you advise a optimal period in hours of fasting followed by hours not fasting?
Also on none fasting days. recommend calorie intake whether it is normal or surplus?
Would a ketogenic diet play some role in pre and post fast to minimise shock to the body and bring ketone levels up before a total nutritional cut off?
And any thoughts on carb loading or cheat days relating to IF?
Why have you not had your work published in a peer reviewed journal? I find that highly suspicious.
All that sounds great… but for a sec. please consider that.
30-40 years ago people working heavy duty jobs like building constructions, agricultural works, livestock operations for 7/365 days, 12 or 14 hours per day carrying heavy weight loads or working in the sun, and finally during the brake they ate little bread, onions, tomatoes and a few olives, or a cup of soup and that’s it for the day. (I am from Greece and from family of building constructors).
Those people were strong, lean, with stamina, poor, happy and optimistic.
Now we are sick all the time, unsatisfied and with all my respect to the author work, with all that scientific data, – we forgetting that not only the quran reinforce fasting but the christianity too, vigorously i must say, – actually we exploring the proven results of fasting mechanism, without the way to reinforce the fundamental mentality of how to decide to live frugal.
Just a thought for further research: Islam isn’t the only religion that practices their own brand of IF. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (aka Mormons) generally fast once a month. I’m not sure if that’s exactly the type of IF you’re looking to study, but it might also have health benefits.
Are the terms “Intermittent Fasting” and “Alternate Day Fasting” interchangeable? If so, why not settle on one unified term? If not, why are they used interchangeably throughout the article?
Dr Kostevski,
Thank you for sharing your work. Intermittent fasting seems to be a generally safe and effective regime; your year-long efforts help reveal the scientific underpinnings.
I also read dietdoctor.com edited by another Swedish doctor, Dr Andreas Eenfeldt.
Looks like we should look to Swedish doctors for leadership…!
Kind regards,

I was a half-assed pescatarian for many years. I went full vegan in March 2013. I’m a 5’8″ 57-year-old female. I’ve been moderately overweight (“you carry it well”) my whole life. Going vegan was hard, especially the beginning. Not anymore, though. I crave “real” raw fresh green foods these days. Weird. 2 years ago I was 185. In March I was around 175. Today, I’m 143 working towards 135 so that I can bounce around between 135 and 139. 139 is apparently, roughly the “ideal” weight for my stats. I’ve always known that I can’t eat at night. My partner gets home late, loves to cook and thinks nothing of eating a gigantic steak and full meal at 11pm. It was a tough change for me. Now, I limit my food to window of time. Mid-to-late morning thru till around 6pm at the very latest. I try to quit any big meal (and my meals aren’t that big anymore anyway) by 4pm. The better I hang during those hours AND the closer I stick to RAW VEGAN, the faster the weight just MELTS away. I’m not perfect and have some social times where, while still eating vegan of course, I eat too late or too much. It seems to me like I almost need those occasional times to re-jumpstart the downward trend. I swim for 20 minutes a day. I think dropping your body temp for a while also is good for kick-starting your body energy. I love to dance and dance around our condo all the time. I work from home. I realized that I was doing some kind of intermittent fasting and it sure seems to line up with my experience. I am ON FIRE with ENERGY —— ALL THE TIME!!!!!! I feel euphoric often. I feel so dang healthy I want to shout it from the rooftops! I haven’t had any cold or flu this season yet. Don’t expect to.
Now, I eat for nutrition. I listen to my body more. I feel like a different person. I feel clean and wonderful inside! I know I’ve lost some muscle mass. I’m about to start a weight-focused routine focusing on my gluts and general core strength. Looking forward to reshaping what’s left into the “new me!”
Anyway, just thought I’d share on the off chance it inspires anyone else!
Thank you for the awesome info.
Sorry, I meant so say I went Vegan in March 2014. My weight loss has been about a 10-month journey.
Amen! Thanks for sharing your work with us!!
I am just now diving into IF, thanks to Dr Mercola occasionally promoting it.
I haven’t combed all though your website yet. Is there a spot where I can get more basic how to details on the types of IF…and also figure our which is best more weight loss. I am not obese…just modern day over weight. I’ll do some more peaking around.
Thanks!
Wow, absolutely amazing. Mind blown, thank you so incredibly much. I’ve been doing IM for about 3 weeks now, every day, based on a friend who recommended it and I’ve been loving it. I’ve been drinking lemon water and matcha green tea throughout my fasting period though, and I’m wondering if you think these will limit the benefits I get in terms of HGH / Testosterone. What’s your opinion on this? Can I still take lemon water & matcha green tea? (some people say matcha has no calories, some say it’s 3 calories per gram. I only take about 3 grams. And one small lime, which has about 5mL of juice). Would really appreciate your opinion on this =) Thank you SO much! Shared!
This is excellent. Thank you very much.
Congratulations on acquiring your MD. I will hopefully be following in your footsteps when I graduate in 2017.
James
took some effort putting all this info into one place, appreciated
Thank you for the Great work you have done! Its a appreciated as much as I appreciat my kids!
Thank you so much for sharing your research and information. It is refreshing to know that someone is giving the information to anyone that wants to access it for free. I have been so disappointed by all the teaser ads out there that link me to a lengthy video ending up with the “secret” cure not being revealed unless you buy their expensive product.
Thank you .
Superb review, thank you so much for sharing. I am an undergraduate studying nutrition and I am currently writing my dissertation on time to exhaustion in male subjects during intermittent fasting. The collation of literature here has helped me no end. Thank you so much again for sharing and congratulations on achieving your MD!January 16, 2014 some of our airmen,” said Gen. Mark A. Welsh III, Air Force chief of staff.
The monthly test is designed to evaluate crew members on their knowledge of how to perform standard operational duties, he said.
During the course of the drug probe, investigators discovered that a missile launch officer at the 341st Missile Wing shared answers with 16 other officers. About 190 officers work at the base.
“I believe it was a text message” that tipped off the crew members,” Welsh told reporters. “The details need to stay with the investigation for now, as they try and pull the string on this. But that's how it was shared.”
The other half of the officers implicated confessed after their colleagues were caught.
It’s unclear whether any of the members used the answers, but they didn’t tell superiors about the transgression.
The officers range in rank from second lieutenants to captains.
All 34 individuals are now off missile crew duty and the service has suspended their security clearances.

January 16, 2014Infamous Marla Maples stalker and shoe fetishist Chuck Jones copped to sending Donald Trump’s ex a barrage of crude emails and possessing a stun gun in a Manhattan court Friday in exchange for 60 days in jail.
“It’s time to let go and move on with my life,” said the dapper weirdo, who wore a stylish tweed jacket as he left Manhattan Supreme Court.
Jones was busted in May of 2012 for sending Maples a slew of bizarre messages.
“I hope your Easter basket catches fire and burns your house to the ground…Now shove an egg in your slimy mouth and choke,” he wrote. “I hope you choke on an Easter bunny.”
Justice Ronald Zweibel ordered Jones to abide by an order of protection forbidding any communication with the 50-year-old socialite and her daughter Tiffany Trump.
As part of the plea deal, Jones must attend counseling during the five years he’s on probation.
At trial, Jones would have faced up to seven years if convicted on the top count.
Jones was Maples’s publicist in the 1990s when she began dating the then married mogul and handled a media firestorm when their scandalous affair became public.
He has been bedeviling the Georgia-born Maples ever since.
The kinky grandfather was busted in 1992 for stealing 70 pairs of her high heels, sneakers and slippers and stashing them in his Midtown office.
He readily admitted to having a “sexual relationship” with the footwear at his 1994 trial and did prison time.
Jones was also ordered to stop filing frivolous and harassing lawsuits against the former beauty queen.
“Mr. Jones has realized that it’s time to put the past behind him and spend more time with his family especially his grandchildren,” said the shoe lover’s defense lawyer Donald Vogelman.
Jones is scheduled to return to court in March for sentencingCelebrating the connections people make on Facebook

I live just a few minutes from Asnelles, so it would be easy to go and talk to the producers there. I know that oysters are available from them all year, but many of the local restaurants don't have oysters on the menu all year.
Oysters during their milky stage do have their fans, just like some prefer their Camembert under ripe and still chalky in the middle. It's a matter of personal preference.
I trust well researched resources. :)
Every website I'm reading says that summer oysters are "milky" due to the reproductive cycle, and firmer and tastier in the winter months.
I must have very different information. I understood that oysters spawn during the summer, so their texture isn't as firm and therefore not as interesting to eat.
Sorry if I'm mistaken, I thought that due to the reproductive cycle of oysters, they weren't as succulent in the summer? I don't see as many oysters available here in Normandy in the summer, just like I don't see mussels as readily available during the winter when they have to import them from Belgium, and are considered "inferior."
Glad to have been of some help. You might want to check Chez Paulette's Facebook page for their hours on the day you will be in Bayeux, which you didn't mention in your original post.
Meuvaines has a population of 150. I'm not aware of any restaurants there, so your closest options are Bayeux, Asnelles or Arromanches.
I don't often eat raw oysters, so can't help you with a seafood place. There are plenty in Courseulles-sur-Mer and Port-en-Bessin, so I'm sure you could find some, depending on the time of year that you are coming to Normandy. If you're coming soon, then the season for oysters is pretty much over until September. They can be found, but aren't as good.
Have a great trip!
Chez Paulette is a new tea salon in the center of Bayeux, across the street from the MAHB museum. All fresh and locally (usually organic) sourced ingredients and very good! They have salads, savory and sweet tarts and other desserts. La Reine Mathilde does do sandwiches, crêpes, etc. Their menu is online.There's also a crêperie not far from the Office of Tourism, le Triskell, that is good.If La Rapière is over budget, then le Pommier will be as well.
Normandy Restaurants?
I live in Bayeux and recommend that you avoid Château de Sully and Château d'Audrieu. However I highly recommend Château la Chenevière near Port-en-Bessin and Le Manoir de la Drôme in Balleroy. Have a wonderful trip!
Languedoc, Luberon, Provence and Girona and Calella
I agree with you, John. Marseille is a dynamic, wonderful city! I have been there several times over the years and enjoyed every visit.
Eating in the Minervois?
I live about 20 minutes from Caunes and have a few restaurant recommendations for you. Try Les Meulieres in la Livinière, Restaurant Chabbert in Fauzan, En Bonne Compagnie in Homps, Le Bel Minervois in Olonzac and l'Oustal de Citou in Citou.Le Restaurant d'Alibert is good. "Correct" as we say in France. I would give it a try and you'll enjoy meeting Frederic, the Maître D. Have a wonderful trip and hope you enjoy le Minervois!
Looking for dried big hominy...
Thank you!

Canal du Midi between Castelnaudary and Homps/VVaison-la-Romaine
Definitely try Restaurant En Bonne Compagnie in Homps (). Make sure to reserve.Avoid La Peniche in Homps. Terrible place.
Unfortunately there aren't that many great restaurants along the Canal, so I would advise you do your own cooking and take advantage of take away dishes from local traiteurs and make your own picnics from vegetables, charcuterie and cheese from the markets.The Saturday morning market in Carcassonne is wonderful and there's a great Tuesday morning market in Olonzac, just a couple of miles from Homps.Have a wonderful trip!

First to chime in was Dennis Byrne, a great conservative pundit and White Sox fan, probably not in that order. He made the excellent observation that Buehrle's gem pushed aside the stench of former Sox pitcher Jim Parque's admission of using Human Growth Hormone.
Next up was a post from RedEye sports editor Brian Moore, who asked readers to share stories about where they were when we watched the final outs of the Buehrle perfect game. OK, so where were you?
We sure picked a great day to launch our new White Sox blog, SoxNet, didn't we? Jason Gage's post, which he'll be updating throughout the night, has a roundup of what the Sox and other blogs are saying.
Jason's simmering mind conjured up this question: Is Buehrle the first in Major Leage history to have won and saved a World Series game and thrown a perfect game and a no-hitter?
Kap's Corner blogger David Kaplan, who has seen his share of Chicago athletes come and go during his years on the scene, wrote that such an accomplishment couldn't have happened to a nicer guy.
From the serious to the sublime: White Sox in Haiku took a couple of shots at capturing Buehrle's perfect game in 17 syllables. Now it's your turn: can you write the perfect haiku?
And last, at least for the first hour of our coverage, was a report from Breaking Tweets Chicago, which found that at least for a few minutes Mark Buehrle, #whitesox and Chicago White Sox were all Trending Topics.
Take that, Aramis Ramirez, #cubs and Wrigley Field.
Stay tuned to ChicagoNow, where we'll have many more discussions about Buehrle's historic gem throughout the night and into tomorrow.

Maryland Rep. Roscoe Bartlett, a 19-year Republican congressman, has officially sent the "Stimulus To Allow Critical Hair Expenses," or "STACHE Act," on to the House Ways and Means Committee, where all tax legislation must be studied before it can be debated on the floor.
"There is a long road ahead for this important legislation," said AMI Chief Executive Officer Dr. Abraham Jonas Froman in a statement.
In order to support the bill, the AMI has planned a "Million Mustache March" in Washington, D.C. on April 1.
The bill is based off of a white paper from Dr. John Yuetter of Northeastern State University, who proposes that "It is appropriate that Congress allow a limited [number] of deductions to people of Mustached American heritage in recognition of the value that their lifestyle provides to the economy, to society, and to the environment."
According to the white paper, 74 percent of the U.S. population supports a tax break for people with mustaches. The only notable dissenting population is Goateed Americans, 69 percent of whom oppose the tax break based on charges of "facialism."
The STACHE Act follows Dr. Yuetter's recommendation by allowing a $250 yearly tax deduction for those with mustaches to account for "grooming supplies."
With Bartlett locked in a tight re-election campaign since his district was redrawn to include more Democratic voters, some of his opponents have begun attacking him over the STACHE Act.
Although Rep. Bartlett and his clean, white moustache would be able to take advantage of the new tax break, passing the bill along to a committee does not guarantee the congressman's support.
In a public statement, Bartlett's chief of staff said that while the legislator is "pro-stache," he does not think "Americans should pay for people's personal grooming decisions."$ 114.99

A WOMANS RIGHT TO CHOOSE
Im certainly in agreement with John Powers critique of the pernicious, completely degrading images of women in todays film and television [On, Bad Girls, June 25July 1]. However, he doesnt go far enough in pushing his accurate assessment into a strong argument, one that would aggressively get to the heart of the issue as to why womens images in contemporary film and television have escalated in their demeaning quality.
In the first place (and I realize this is an old, though still accurate, argument), nobody held a gun to those womens heads to make them exploit themselves by taking those degrading roles. Instead, the powers-that-be did something more seductive, an act to which were all vulnerable: They offered those women money lots of it in many cases and an open doorway to fame. I can guarantee that Tina Fey loved the big, fat check she got for Mean Girls, even if she did have to show her breasts. Quite frankly, that was her choice to make and who are we to judge her, or anyone else (male or female), for it?
We all know much of the movie and television business is toxic. But if women really want to change it, they have to change it themselves. Each woman who gets propositioned to humiliate herself on film can refuse, can make the serious, personal sacrifice of saying no. These women are all adults. We have to stop treating them like helpless victims.
Mr. Powers, its time to start putting the onus of responsibility back where it belongs on the individual. Because only with a collective of right-thinking individuals (male and female) can the system be taken on with the great force that is necessary to, if not reform it, at least get it back in balance.

THE PLOT THICKENS
As a regular and generally satisfied reader of L.A. Weekly, I am really surprised with how narrowly Robert Greene portrays city planning director Con Howe [Plotting Upheaval, June 25July 1].
To base an article on the plotting of a handful of disgruntled employees who want Howe out (and not comment on views of the majority) constitutes a real disservice to Weekly readers, who likely know little else of the director. Why was the Howe quote Ultimately it is the council and the mayor that set policy not commented on? That the Planning Department was, as Greene reports, already foundering under low morale, that Howes task was already monumental when he walked in the door, and that he faced an unprecedented series of disasters when he began his tenure certainly need to be addressed more fully.
Greatly lacking in the article is the important issue of historic preservation. Contrary to Howes alleged unfair treatment . . . of neighborhoods around the city in historic preservation, he has literally thousands of fans. On Howes watch, the number of historic-preservation zones has tripled and, a few years ago, the city of Los Angeles was chosen for the first time ever as the location of the National Trust for Historical Preservations annual convention. As a result of preservation successes, Howe has been responsible for growing numbers of tourist dollars to L.A.
Many of us want a report that is fair and balanced regarding the progress that the Planning Department has made on Con Howes watch. If L.A. Weekly conducts this type of investigation, a very different article will appear in a future edition.

PALER SHADE OF PORN
I am a bit confused by the Larry Sultan spread [Just Another Day in the Valley, June 25July 1]. Initially I was excited, thinking the Weekly did a story on Jeff Burton! Then I realized they werent Burtons photos. I feel duped. Burton has been living in L.A. and working as a photographer in and around the porn industry for more than 15 years. He has developed a beautiful and intense body of work that arises from his intimate relationship with the industry. He has shown these photographs in museums and galleries worldwide. He has two books published of his work.
Sultan, on the other hand, has made the industry his current project, in which he is merely a voyeur. Sharing the terrain is not what bothers me though; its the fact that his pictures look a little too much like Burtons. The cropping, the interiors and the light all reference Burtons work but ultimately pale in comparison. It also seems suspicious to put Sultans (not very interesting nor beautiful) picture of two blonde chicks kneeling on the floor on the cover of the Weekly when, for example, a heart-rippingly beautiful photo of a guy eating another guys ass, by Burton, has yet to appear there.

Ella Taylor repeats the oft-repeated error of crediting Stan Lee as Spider-Mans sole creator [Eight-Legged Freaks, July 2-8]. While it is true that Lee co-created Spider-Man, Steve Ditko was the artist who designed the costume and co-created the entire mythos of the character. Since Lee still is involved with Marvel, he is often credited as the sole creator, but it is only fair to give mention to Ditko, without whom Spider-Man (if he existed today) would be completely different in his look and attitude.

If you’re a marketer struggling to decipher the complicated marketing technology landscape of more than 5,000 vendors – and show me a marketer who isn’t – then I have some good news for you. It won’t be as easy as following the yellow brick road, but you can begin to make sense of today’s seemingly infinite array of enterprise marketing technology (EMT) offerings.
Two of my research areas at Forrester are Cross-Channel Campaign Management (CCCM) and Real-Time Interaction Management (RTIM). I field myriad inquiries on both, as they are critical, confusing, and conflated in terms of technology and vendor overlap. While CCCM primarily focuses on automating marketing-driven campaign strategies for outbound channels, and RTIM primarily focuses on next-best-action strategies for customer-initiated interactions via inbound channels, both rely heavily on systems of insight (customer data and analytics) and systems of engagement (automated content and interactions). And both cover multiple inbound, outbound, digital, and offline channels.
CCCM is evolving as marketers strive to align highly personalized marketing campaigns with customer-initiated interactions to drive deeper levels of engagement throughout the customer life cycle. I addressed this evolution in The Forrester Wave™: Cross-Channel Campaign Management, Q2 2016, which featured 15 leading vendors. Since the CCCM space is much broader, earlier this year I also published the Vendor Landscape: Cross-Channel Campaign Management, and it adds a further 32 vendors to the mix, categorizing them as enterprise, small, or regional players, and reviewing capabilities such as vertical expertise or content management. to help.Sex Dating Mississauga

TUCSON, Ariz. — Arizona State University and an anti-abortion student group should consider settling a three-year legal battle over a campus free-speech issue, a federal judge said this week.
ASU Students for Life’s 2006 lawsuit argued that the university discriminated against students by imposing an insurance requirement for on-campus events. The university has since implemented and modified a written policy that loosens the requirements.
“It sounds like you have achieved a victory,” Alex Kozinski, chief judge of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, told Heather Gebelin Hacker, an Alliance Defense Fund attorney representing the student group.
But Hacker said during arguments Oct. 20 at the University of Arizona law college that there’s no certainty that the university won’t change its policies again without a court ruling in favor of protection of free speech on campus. The trial court ruling being appealed went in favor of the university, Hacker noted.
“This case is really about the principle,” she said, adding that students need “a bright-line rule.”
Michael Goodwin, an assistant attorney general representing the university, said the lawsuit still is seeking nominal damages from two university officials in connection with enforcement of the policy.
Goodwin assured the court that the university would not revert to its previous policy, but Hacker said that assurance didn’t have the force of law.
“Oh, come on,” replied one of the judges, retired Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O’Connor.
A desire by the plaintiffs to be awarded attorneys fees also could be at play, Goodwin said in response to a question by Kozinski.
The judge said he’d rather not have to rule on the constitutionality of a policy that no longer is in use.
During a question-and-answer period following arguments on the ASU case and another, Kozinski said he regularly urges lawyers to try to have their clients settle cases.
That can be better than taking the risk involved in having the court decide the outcome and achieve a result more in line with the parties’ goals, he said.
“I always consider it a victory when the parties wind up settling,” he said.
While sometimes litigation can’t be avoided, a different type of resolution “may preserve that resolution that lets them go forward on a positive note,” he said.

According to Kirk Skaugen, vice president and general manager of Intel’s Data Center and Connected System Group, the company was looking to add a high performance network fabric to its stable of HPC technologies and approached QLogic with an offer. The deal, which Skaugen described as a “win-win for both companies” sends $125 million in cash to QLogic allowing it to focus on its core competencies in converged and storage networking. Meanwhile Intel gets an HPC fabric technology and product line that it intends to leverage to the max for its supercomputing business.
Given the high margins of the Xeon server CPUs and the large numbers of chips required in supercomputers, the HPC business is already a big money maker for Intel. In 2010, HPC was 15 percent of the company’s Xeon sales. And according to Skaugen, that business is going to get even more attractive. “By 2018, the top 100 supercomputers in the world will represent the same [processor] volume as half of the world’s server market as we know it today,” he says.
From Skaugen’s perspective, leadership in HPC fabrics going to help drive that along a couple of different dimensions. To being with, he says the company is committed to QLogic’s existing line InfiniBand adapters and switches and will continue to sell them in the HPC cluster marketplace. At the same time they will use the technology as a foundation to help build an integrated fabric architecture for its future manycore processors. “In both cases, we plan to invest to be number one in high performance computing fabrics,” Skaugen told HPCwire. Intel would also be free to include the adapter chips on their recently launched HPC server boards or even sell the InfiniBand ASICs to third-party storage and network vendors, although Skaugen did not ellaborate on either of those possibilities.
The chipmaker’s plans to use the technology for delivering on its exascale plans have to do less with InfiniBand, per se, than owning a fabric technology (patents, IP, and engineering talent) geared for high performance computing. On the compute side, Intel has pinned its hopes on its Many Integrated Core (MIC) architecture to bring the x86 architecture into the exaflops realm, but shoehorning a whole exaflop system inside the oft-mentioned 20MW power budget is going to require on-chip integration of the interprocessor communication fabric. In the QLogic technology, they see a scalable fabric that can be integrated into future x86 microprocessors that will deliver the requisite performance per watt.
Needless to say, the QLogic acquisition would appear to pit Intel against Mellanox, the current leader in all things InfiniBand. Skaugen, though, reminds us that Mellanox is an Intel partner too, selling both Ethernet and InfiniBand adapter parts atop Intel server boards. And since Intel already has an Ethernet play via its Fulcrum and NetEffect acquistions, the QLogic deal would fall into the same category.
That’s not saying Intel is going to always play nice with Mellanox. When you aim to be “number one in high performance computing fabrics,” you can’t avoid bumping into the InfiniBand leader from time to time. But, unlike QLogic and Fulcrum, which had to go head-to-head with Mellanox and other interconnect vendors to succeed, Intel can also derive value from the QLogic technology through packaging and integration with its CPU-based products.
Internally, Intel will segregate its Ethernet and InfinBand products along traditional lines, with the 10GbE offerings aimed at the commercial enterprise business, cloud computing, and the lower rung of the HPC space. InfiniBand meanwhile will be mostly reserved for supercomputing, which in this case refers to systems above the departmental cluster level. If vendors with specialized appliances, like Oracle’s Exadata machine or other company’s with business intelligence boxes, display a desire for InfiniBand-level latency and bandwidth, Intel will pursue those opportunities as well.
The acquisition of the QLogic technology does put Intel into somewhat of an embarrasing position inasmuch as its Sandy Bridge Xeon (E5) processors come with built-in support PCIe 3.0, the interface required to fully support Fourteen Data Rate (FDR) InfiniBand. As it currently stands, only Mellanox adapters can take advantage of that capability, since the QLogic technology does not yet offer FDR support. Skaugen wouldn’t say when they plan to move the QLogic architecture to FDR, hinting only that he believes QDR is going to be predominant InfiniBand speed in HPC systems for the next year or so.
The acquisition will close by the end of the current quarter, assuming the deal doesn’t run afoul of regulators or encounter a revolt from big stockholders. Intel has made offers to QLogic employees associated with the InfiniBand business and expects to get most if not all of them on board when the aquisition completes.I we there isn’t mood music to accompany the visuals but I am half expecting a string quartet to become involved at some stage.

Electronista is reporting that Apple has just filed a complaint with the European Commission regarding Motorola’s recent legal actions. The handset-maker won an injunction in Germany last month, resulting in the temporary ban of some of Apple’s products.
But Apple has maintained that the patents that Motorola is asserting against it are industry standard, and therefore fall under FRAND jurisdiction. And since Motorola doesn’t seem to want to offer Apple a FRAND license, Apple went to the EC…
According to the report, a recent SEC filing revealed that Motorola has received a letter from the European Commission notifying them of Apple’s inquiry. The details of the complaint have not been made public yet, but we’re assuming that it has something to do with the recent Germany injunction.
Apple feels that unlike its own software and design-oriented lawsuits that it has lodged against Samsung and other Android partners, Motorola’s lawsuit involves patents on hardware that is necessary to the function of any smartphone and would be difficult, if not impossible, to work around.
That’s why it’s calling FRAND abuse, because under Fair Reasonable and Non-discriminatory terms, companies holding industry-standard patents must offer reasonable licensing terms on those patents to other companies. And Motorola’s licensing offer to Apple was anything but reasonable.
Apple might actually get its way here. EU officials have already started initial antitrust investigations into both Motorola and Samsung due to their legal actions regarding their FRAND patents. And if the European Commission steps in, then Motorola will either have to abandon its lawsuit against Apple, or substantially lower its licensing fee. Interesting.all images screenshots from the film
It's not only a wonderful record of an Italian-American couple (Scorsese's parents), it also provides a glimpse of Little Italy in the 1970s.
In shots mostly appearing in part two, Little Italy is a neighborhood where the streets are full of life. Fruit and vegetable peddlers sell their wares on the sidewalks where children play a game of sliding, belly-first, on sheets of cardboard. Barber poles spin and old men sit outside in chairs and on boxes to watch the human parade go by.
Catherine and Charles Scorsese tell stories about growing up in the neighborhood--about tough mothers who scrubbed the floors without complaint and fathers who worked in scaffolding, about stealing fruit from pushcarts and being a Shabbos goy.
In the beginning of part three, Catherine Scorsese talks about what happened when the Italians first came to the neighborhood, when it was still Irish territory, and the cultures clashed. She says, in defense of the Irish, "It's just like everything else, you know, they were here first. Naturally, it's just like kids when they find something, and they find it and they have it, and then somebody comes along and wants it and they say, 'No, I found it first.' Right? ... But then, they sort of, everybody got together and they made one happy family. That's all."
I can't help but think about today's territory clash in Little Italy, between the Italian-Americans and the Nolitans. In all the reporting, I haven't heard one Nolitan express the empathy and understanding that Mrs. Scorsese did in the quote above.

Jeremiah, you're on a run. 1st Mean Streets and now italianamerican. I love both films and just watched italianamerican 2 months ago. It reminds me of my grandparents and growing up in the 70's. The simplicity and warmth of the kitchen and living room, where life unfolds.
I agree with Filmatix and the comparison. I actually don't mind Chinatown swallowing Little Italy.
At least it's another genuine ethnic community replacing the old one.
But Chinatown is under threat as well, so we'll see what happens.
"Delete: vibrant community full of commerce, tradition, delicious, affordable food, and character."
Delicious, Affordable food? Have you been down there? It is at minimum $12 for a dish of cold pasta bought from restaurant depot and sauce. commerce? What, the fake purses and shirts that say hot guido mom? Tradition? Of whom? The eastern europeans who pretend to be italian and work there and don't live in nyc?
The only character remains in the residents of Little Italy who vastly oppose the disgusting street festivals.
The Villager article that you linked to, written by Victor J. Papa, is a great one. I hope it gets printed out and distributed all over the neighborhood.
There was one manager of a swimwear store who was quoted on DNAinfo as saying "Obviously we came to this neighborhood knowing it was here," she said of the festival. "It's not our place to say whether it should or should not stop at Kenmare." Wish there were more like her.
Everything, EVERYTHING in NYC changes and it always has. I spent a lot of time mourning the changes and then i realized, you can't stop it. It's the nature of this city, it's why we live here and it's what makes it vibrant and inspiring. As someone who has lived on Mulberry street for 10 years, I've seen a lot of change, but mostly the elderly italians who used to live here have passed away and their children and grandchildren didn't live here. I can say with authority that San Gennaro has very little cultural attachment to Little Italy anymore. Its filled with the same vendors and scumbags as any other street fair they set up in the city- most of them not even from NYC. It's pointless to carry on a tradition that no longer has a specific value to it. Holding onto a past that no longer exists is futile.
NYC is a city of commerce, and landlords are really the ones who control the demographics of an area. All this change is attributable at the root to vast increases in rent prices where the longterm tenants are forced out and money moves in.
"Italianamerican" will also be on TCM on Wednesday the 16th (7pm), followed by "Weddings and Babies," which is shot in Greenwich Village and Little Italy-- with visits to the Feast -- in the late 1950's.
(Also appearing is the Sunnyside/Woodside graveyard district.)
as someone who has lived in the city for 50+ years, i'd have to say it's been a long time since the feast and the neighborhood has been vibrant and/or ethnic. i do miss the bingo-playing grandmas, and their shopping carts.
if you remember on of the best lines in mean streets was: "i hate that feast with a passion."
Have lived here for decades and have always hated it with a passion. But it is, even in present form, part of the neighborhood and I'll defend it against boutique owners who don't want their clothes to smell of grease. (But note also the context of the Mean Streets remark: San Gennaro is Neapolitan and Elizabeth Street Sicilian: not long after Gennaro there was a small neighborhood feast for San Gandolfo, who is now relegated to a table at San Gennaro's.) The city does change all the time, but what is different now is the lack of continuity and the obliteration of the economic diversity (both of residents and types of businesses) that always gave the city its character and vitality.Advertising

Get Social with BTRNew Delhi railway station will be soon equipped with free W-Fi connectivity – a move that will bring one of India's busiest railway stations to the level of the major international airports in the country.
“A Mumbai-based company has been given the job to make the New Delhi station a Wi-Fi enabled station,” a senior Railway Ministry official is quoted as saying, adding “the company was selected through tender.”
According to the official, passengers on all platforms of the Delhi railway station can access the Wi-Fi service from their mobile phones and laptops. The official reveals about Rs. 80 lakh will be spent on installing the facility at the station. “The system is expected to be operational in 3 to 4 months,” the official said.
The move comes shortly after the Indian Railways introduced free Wi-Fi services on Howrah Rajdhani trains.
“We are exploring to mount tablets on walls at certain places in the station for the benefit of passengers. The tablets will be equipped to disseminate information about the train position, expected arrival time and other relevant data required by the passenger,” the official said.
Last year, Bangalore division of Indian Railways in coordination with RailTel and Telibrahma had launched “BluFi” services for the city railway station. The BluFi services allow passengers to access online content such as videos, games, wallpapers along with Railway-related information information such as PNR status, just by switching Bluetooth on their mobile devices at the station.Today, I registered for my first ultra.
On October 6, I will be running the Stump Jump 50K in Chattanooga. I'm pretty excited about taking the plunge and officially committing to do it.
I promptly went outside and ran 3 miles in between thunderstorms. I know I have a ways to go before I can run a 50K, but it was great to just get out there and to know that I now have a new goal.
I have managed to convince another friend to plan on running it as well, and I started working on a few others at a Cinco de Mayo party last night. See? Sometimes peer pressure can be good... getting others to do something active!
I'll eventually sit down and sort out a training plan, but I won't really need to start training until July. In the meantime, I want to gradually get myself building mileage so that I'm ready for the half marathon in Chicago in July, and then I'll transition to 50K training.
This race is on trails, so I'm also going to start training on trails. The local Fleet Feet is doing group trail runs the next 8 Thursdays, so I plan on using those to not only start learning the trails at the park nearby but also to meet new people.
I have decided not to pay to join the ultra training group with the running store. I don't think it'd be worth the money for me when I know I'm capable of setting a training plan and I have a fair number of friends that I can do long runs with in addition to the Nashville Striders marathon training runs that will start in July.
I'm pretty excited. I think this is just the challenge I need right now!

The Amherst Rail Trail is an ideal location to catch a glimpse of birds enjoying the longer spring days. Naturalist and nature photographer John Green will lead a bird walk for all those interested in learning about what they’re seeing, and hearing, along the trail on Saturday.
“The main part of migration is mid-May so we’re sneaking up on it,” Green said. “We’ll be taking a listen to all the different species.”
By late April, bird watchers should see birds that spend the winter here, as well some birds that return to this area in the spring. Chickadees, titmice and cardinals should be out, as well as warblers, early warblers and the flycatcher species. Flycatchers, such as the phoebe, eastern pewee and the kingbird, are often seen on an exposed perch, then fly off when they spot something to eat, and return to their perch.
“Other birds fly-catch, like cedar waxwings and a few warblers, and dragonflies do it,” Green said. “Their behavior is quite obvious in an open area.”
Nature photographers familiar with flycatcher species can get good shots because of the species’ predictable behavior, Green said.
Walk participants will also have their ears open, noticing the various calls of the birds. Green will talk a bit about the small differences in bird calls and songs. The eastern phoebe, for example, is often confused with a chickadee because of the birds’ similar calls.
Green said the Amherst Rail Trail provides an ideal setting for bird watching. The open space, with a swamp on one side and fields, woods and other habitats on the other, provides the perfect place for many birds to visit or make their homes.
“If you go into the thick woods, you might only hear (the birds), or you might get a little glimpse of them,” he said. “But here, you have a good chance to see things out in the open. A few songbirds might be in trees that aren’t that tall.”
Participants might see some cavity nesting birds in the dead trees in the swampy area, such as grackles, red wings and tree swallows. There’s also a possibility of seeing a great blue heron, mallard ducks, wood ducks or Canada geese.
Bird watching along the trail should require nothing more than a good sense of sight, hearing and awareness. Binoculars aren’t necessary.
“Using binoculars takes a little practice,” Green said. “Sometimes, all you see are branches and that can be frustrating for some folks.”
The pace of the program is quite leisurely, and is ideal for beginners and those who know a little about bird species. Green said he likes to take his time, focusing on quality rather than quantity of birds.
“For those that are new at it, we got at a slow enough pace that they can pick up something,” Green said. “Those who know a little bit can concentrate on learning vocalizations.”
The program runs from 7 to 10 a.m. on Saturday. The fee is $10 for adult members of Mass Audubon, and $15 for non-members. Registration is required, and can be completed by calling Arcadia Wildlife Sanctuary at (413) 584-3009.
Participants are asked to meet at the Amherst Rail Trail by taking Route 9 East into Amherst. Take a right onto Southeast Street. Go under two bridges and continue to the fork in the road. Take an immediate left turn onto Station Road, and drive about five minutes to a parking area on the right, just before the railroad tracks.BridgetFollow Bridget

Analysts expected a reading of 108.0. The Ifo sub-index, which measures companies' expectations for the next six months, rose to 104.2 from 103.3 in August. The current conditions index, however, slipped to 111.4 from 112.0 last month. "Although companies assessed their current business situation slightly less favorably, their business expectations were once again more optimistic. The German economy made a confident start to the autumn," Kai Carstensen, head of business analysis and surveys at Ifo, in the release.

The Velopress is a coffee machine on wheels
Velopresso is a pedal-powered mobile coffee-maker that requires no electricity. Amos Field Reid and Lasse Oiva, two London Royal College of Art design students, came up with this ingenious vehicle as a way to sell coffee on the street. The custom-made bicycle can switch between gears that power the bike or drive a coffee grinder. The hot water is generated via a portable boiler, which is powered by a small gas canister.
The design is a fusion of their love for coffee, cycling and sustainable design. The duo is looking to extend their efforts at sustainability further by exploring ways to convert the waste coffee grounds into ethanol. The design has won the Deutsche Bank Award 2012 and received the second place price at the 2012 Pininfarina Design Contest. The team is currently looking for an industrial producer for their design, which means the Velopresso could be pedaling your way sometime in the future.Immortally Yours is a musicalized modern-day retelling of Romeo & Juliet that instead of Capulet's and Montague's, pits vampires against werewolves.

ReviewsGuest post written by Geoff Galat
Geoff Galat is VP of Worldwide Marketing at Tealeaf.
Geoff Galat: Attention cell phone shoppers!
It’s clear that mobile commerce presents a tremendous opportunity for retailers. Consumers are moving to the mobile channel in droves. For example, a recent study by IBM shows that mobile commerce accounted for more than 10 percent of online traffic on Cyber Monday. However, despite their record-setting gains this holiday season, retailers still face a daunting challenge: providing an experience that meets the expectations of their demanding mobile customers.
To get a feel for how satisfied mobile shoppers are, Tealeaf commissioned Crimson Hexagon to perform advanced sentiment analysis of social media comments about mobile commerce with the top 35 mobile retailers worldwide. We found that 58% of the comments about mobile shopping were generally positive, including such gems as:
- Wow, just did half my #Christmas shopping on the bus, using my #iPhone _____ app. #ihearttech #blackfridaybedamned
- shopping on _____mobile in class !!! (: lol at least it goes along w/ what im learning in economics right now lol
- We just passed fools camping outside of _____. folks, you want good deals? there’s an app for that!
A large number of the positive comments focused on ease of use, time savings and instant deals. Yet, while more than a third of them praised mobile features and functionality, less than a fifth stated mobile sites and apps were easy to use.
Much Room for Improvement
It’s clear that retailers still have much work to do on their mobile channels. Even for those top retailers in the Crimson Hexagon study, which account for the lion’s share of the sales to mobile devices, 41 percent of consumer comments indicated frustration. More than half of these negative comments had to do with “customer struggles” – the obstacles that customers encounter as they try to complete a transaction. Sources of customer struggle include things like apps that don’t work as promised, forms that are difficult to complete from a mobile device or confusing instructions. Customer struggle doesn’t always prevent consumers from buying, but it frequently keeps them from returning and often incites them to share their poor experiences very publicly. Have a look at these choice comments (I’ve removed the retailer names to protect the not-so-innocent):
- #_____ mobile is down. Not letting me checkout. CS says it’s a known problem. On BlackFriday? I just missed two deals!!
- #______ mobile site does not allow me to filter or advance pages on their sale page and provides no option to browse regular site #fail
Users have extremely high expectations for the mobile shopping experience. In fact, a study by Harris Interactive earlier this year showed that 85 percent of adults who have completed a transaction using a mobile device expect the experience to be better than when using a desktop computer. Where do they get these lofty expectations? Here’s one factor: next time you see a T.V. ad for an iPhone, where the user is shown completing transactions with a couple of effortless swipes, look for the disclaimer at the bottom: “Sequences shortened.”
From the Crimson Hexagon social media analysis, we also found a progression to the comments over the course of the holiday season. During Cyber Week, the social media echo chamber was buzzing about deals, the convenience of shipping on the go, apps that are #winning and those that #fail. In the first week of December, nearly 30 percent of conversations focused on approaching shipping deadlines. Most recently, we’ve seen that nearly a quarter of conversations reference being stressed and running out of time. It seems that even the convenience of mobile shopping doesn’t eliminate the worry of holiday gift-giving.
Opportunity Abounds
The stakes are high for retailers, who risk not only losing shoppers on their mobile channels but customer loyalty altogether. A Harris Interactive study shows that 63 percent of all online adults would be less likely to buy from the same company via other channels if they experienced a problem when conducting a mobile transaction. What’s more, poorly ranked apps in an app store or marketplace won’t be downloaded as often as the retailer had hoped.
The converse is also true, however. By improving the experience they provide, businesses gain customer loyalty and turn consumers into outspoken brand advocates, like these:
- Oh, what Cyber Monday? Hello # ____ app (;
- YES. I’m in line at _____. And refreshing my #____ app for black Friday sales at the same time. #comeatmebro #BlackFriday #pleasejudgeme
To ensure their customers are evangelists instead of naysayers, retailers need a clear understanding of the reality of the mobile experience they provide. They need to uncover the sources of customer struggle and quickly remedy them before additional users are affected. Remember, mobile devices lead to new behaviors—like rotating screens, swiping and varying “folds.” And it’s important to correlate these behaviors with device type so they can pinpoint device-specific issues.

Besides other macros at the domestic level, the rupee movement has been a key factor in determining the market sentiment. Dhawal Dalal, executive vice-president and head (fixed income), DSP BlackRock Investment Managers, tells Puneet Wadhwa that the rupee may remain volatile in the current environment, and it would a prudent strategy to invest in the fixed income products. Edited excerpts:
How do you read the announcements by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in the last policy review amid tapered-down growth forecasts, inflation, weakening rupee and a widening fiscal deficit? Do you think we could see lower growth going ahead with central banks, including ours, slashing key rates?
In the last policy meeting, the central bank kept the policy rate and cash reserve ratio unchanged, despite expectations of a 25 basis point rate cut on account of tapering growth. Most market participants were under the impression that policy decisions would be based on spurring growth, as opposed to controlling inflation.
Related Stories
However, this decision indicates the upside risks of elevated inflation exceeds that of slowing growth. Despite the decrease in oil prices, the sharp depreciation of the rupee against the dollar, coupled with the government’s allowance of subsidies to diesel and kerosene prices, pose upside risks to inflation.
In our view, RBI will continue to watch economic indicators to determine the trajectory of inflation and steps taken by the government to control fiscal deficit before deciding on rate cuts. Currently, the CPI (inflation), a measure of consumer prices, is approximately (at) 10 per cent.
If we have a poor monsoon this year, it could result in higher food prices, translating into higher inflation. Hence, most market participants don’t expect RBI to cut rates in July at this point. As far as other central banks are concerned, monetary policies continue to observe deteriorating growth in their respective economies and are repositioning themselves for a loose monetary policy.
The announcements after policy review also fell short of expectations. What more would you have liked?
In its forward guidance, RBI did not indicate future rate cuts. However, to manage the tight liquidity conditions, the central bank is expected to conduct a series of open market operations (OMOs).
We believe between now and the next policy meeting, ~60,000 crore worth of bonds will enter the market, which should increase bond yields. In the absence of OMOs, bond yields are expected to have an upward bias. Hence, announcements of OMOs are key to maintaining a positive sentiment in the market. We expect the new 10-year bond to trade between 8.15 - 8.25 per cent in the near term.
What is your outlook for bond yields of key countries in the Euro zone and the rupee? How do you see liquidity panning out in the near-to-medium term?
The bond yields of key countries in the Euro zone should remain range-bound and hinge on support of austerity measures and access to bailout funds. Although the rupee has depreciated year to date and continues to remain under pressure, we believe it will trade range-bound in the near-term and then stabilise.
At the rupee’s current level, the exchange rate appears to have priced in the high current account deficit, which has peaked and may gradually decline. The rupee is vulnerable to both inflows and outflows in the near term and may exhibit a heightened level of volatility in the current environment.
What are you advising your clients now? Is it a good time to invest in debt/fixed income?
Our advice to investors is to invest in fixed income products commensurate with their risk appetite. We believe the term structure of interest rates, both from the short and long-term perspective, make the fixed income asset class an attractive investment opportunity. Investors should analyse the credit quality of a portfolio to mitigate credit risk.

TMZ.com is running a report today that sci-fi author Whitley Strieber's upcoming book 2012: The War for Souls may become a Michael Bay film for Warner Bros. In addition, there's a chance that Bay will also direct the picture.
According to the site's info, the year 2012 is a pivotal one for the great planet Earth, "supposedly &#Array; a year of either great spiritual transformation -- or apocalypse." The Mayans believed that year would see the "world order" reversed, good old Nostradamus predicted a comet's collision with the planet, and the Catholic Saint Malachy believed that the last Pope would arrive in 2012, setting off Judgment Day (but with no mention of Terminators, alas). Also, aliens might show up.
Less cheeky is a claim by some scientists that a polar reversal could take place that year, a potentially globe-altering event if ever there was one. TMZ is also reporting that DreamWorks-based producers Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci (also the writers behind the new Star Trek film) are on the project as producers as well, and may also script the film.

Dakin is able to provide the surgeries at $65 off the average price because of funding from PetSmart Charities, said Leslie Harris, Dakin executive director. Dakin is targeting puppies and kittens under six months of age in an effort to combat unwanted litters, she said.
In doing so, Dakin is also helping dispel the myth that those animals are too young for such surgery, said Dr. Sherri Therrien, a veterinarian at Dakin.
“Some people don’t realize that animals can go into heat very young. Typically by six months, but it could be four months of age for kittens and five months for puppies,” she said. “This way you make sure they’re done earlier so there are no unwanted kittens or puppies.”
In addition, spaying and neutering of pediatric animals takes less of a toll on them than on older animals, Therrien said.
Last year, PetSmart Charities also offered funding to Dakin, which performed 305 such surgeries on pediatric animals in June. Pet owners who live in the Pioneer Valley, Worcester counties and Connecticut are eligible to participate.
In order to receive the discounted price, owners must mention the “Precious, Not Parents” campaign when they call or visit to schedule an appointment. The most efficient way to make an appointment is for owners to come in person during Dakin’s spaying and neutering clinic hours from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. Monday through Friday at its Springfield location at 171 Union St. Cash, credit or debit are the only accepted means of pre-payment.
Animals undergoing the surgery must arrive at Dakin at 8 a.m. on the day of the procedure. The average procedure from prep to surgery takes about a half hour. Male puppies and kittens can be picked up at 3 p.m. the same day. Discharge instructions will occur at 3 p.m. for all owners picking up their pets.
Female kittens and puppies must stay at Dakin overnight and can be picked up the following morning at 9 at which time discharge instructions will be conveyed.
In August, PetSmart Charities will also help fund spaying and neutering at Dakin for pit bulls in a campaign called “Primp Your Pit,” in which the animal could be fixed for $20.
For more information about these campaigns or to pre-register, contact Dakin at (413) 781-4019 or visit.We all have dreams. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.’s dream was of a just and equal society in which all individuals were respected for their contributions and where all citizens have equal basic rights and opportunities.
Today, an area in which we continue to experience vast inequality is in health care. This is true when you consider a global perspective, but also when you look at the United States alone. When it comes to infant mortality rates, which are commonly used to indicate a nation’s health status, the U.S. has a rate that continues to be higher than the OECD average. If you do a simple Google search on “health disparities in the U.S.,” statistics from the CDC, AHRQ and other agencies indicate that unacceptable disparities across gender, geographic, racial and socioeconomic lines continue to exist in our country.
Clearly, we have a lot of work to do to ensure that all citizens have access to the right care, at the right time and in a setting close to home. At UMHS, we are working to find solutions to prioritize work on health care disparities in a variety of ways but, most demonstrably, through the newly created UMHS Office of Health Equity and Inclusion. In the coming weeks, we will announce the new Director of this Office.
Today, in honor of Dr. King’s life and dreams, I asked Allison Krieger to interview my father, Rabbi Richard G. Hirsch, about a period in his life when he worked with Dr. King during the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s. His memories and lessons continue to remind me personally that if you doubt what we can do for the future, you need only look at some of the great lessons from our past.

How did you meet Dr. King?
In 1962, I was selected as the Founding Director of an exciting new institution in Washington called the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism. The RAC was founded to represent Jewish social concerns and bring to bear the social justice message of Judaism on the major issues confronting society. We testified before Senate and Congressional committees on issues of social concern, convened conferences, established training programs for clergy and lay leaders, issued publications and activated members of congregations to participate in the political process. Wherever possible we participated with Protestant and Catholic groups, civil liberties and civil rights organizations, and a host of like-minded organizations.
Martin Luther King and I had a mutual friend who suggested that, because we shared common interests and goals, we should meet. So, shortly after I arrived in Washington, Dr. King visited me and we immediately struck up a friendship. Within the first few minutes of meeting him, I recognized his passionate commitment to social justice, his love of the biblical message and his intellectual brilliance.
Dr. King used your office when he would go to Washington, D.C., correct?
Yes. When I discovered that he made frequent trips to Washington, but did not have an office, I told him that he would always have one at the RAC and he graciously accepted my invitation. An additional incentive for him was the fact that the offices of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights were located in our Center. The Leadership Conference on Civil rights was an umbrella group which included the NAACP, the National Urban League, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, the Protestant and Catholic groups, and a host of labor groups, women’s groups and other organizations advocating full rights for minority groups, with special emphasis on rights for African Americans.
Is it accurate that much of the Civil Rights legislation in place today was drafted in your offices?
Yes. In fact, the RAC’s conference room was where critical meetings were held and where public civic groups debated the complex issues of the civil rights legislation. Today, that venue is considered an historic landmark.
How did you and your organization become involved in the 1963 March on Washington?
When Martin Luther King first proposed the March even liberal backers feared that it would lead to violence, and that the interruption of the normal Washington routine would be counterproductive. We – the RAC and I personally – disagreed. Though I initially underestimated the potential significance of the event, I knew that it would be important and productive. So, RAC staff and I became active in every aspect of the planning and implementation of the event. And contrary to some of the nay-sayers, I insisted that it would be peaceful – so much so that we brought Ora, not yet seven years old, with us. It is a day she has never forgotten. For our country and for the world it is a day enshrined in history. It reinforced and became a symbol for the struggle for human rights for all human beings and for all eras
You personally played a significant role in the 1965 Selma, Alabama demonstration, too. Tell me about that.
Yes. I received a call from a friend in the Washington Council of Churches and he told me that Dr. King had issued a call to clergy of all faiths to join him in Selma to demonstrate their support for voters’ rights. They already had 13 Protestant clergymen and one Catholic priest. They wanted me to represent the Jewish clergy. It was considered extremely dangerous – several people had already been killed. I called Bella at home, explained the situation and asked if she would agree to let me go. Of course, she responded as she always has, that I had to do my duty and she encouraged me to go.
When I arrived in Selma, my fellow travelers and I were immediately taken to the church where the demonstration was being held. Thousands of people were gathered outside, and the church itself was packed to the rafters. We were lead to the pulpit where Dr. King was addressing the crowd. When he finished, he came up to me and said “Dick, you’re next.” I was totally unprepared!
For the next 30 minutes, I offered three thoughts – the words of the Midrash. First, I said that Jewish tradition teaches us that when God created man, he created only one man. Why? So that no man would ever be able to say my father is better than your father.
Next, I shared my second thought that according to Jewish tradition, God created man using dust from the four corners of the earth. Why? So that no person would ever be able to say the place from which I come is better than the place from which you come.
Then, I delivered my third and final thought, that when God created man, he used every color of dust. Why? So that no man would ever be able to say the color of my skin is better than the color of your skin.
Thunderous applause lasted for several minutes. Never in my life have I experienced such exaltation and gratification from an audience.
In your book From the Hill to the Mount, you shared your observation that when it comes to civic controversies “No individual and no organization is omniscient and no one has a monopoly on the solution.” Do you think that we, as a nation, have become more adept at dealing with major civic issues?
I consider it to be a great privilege to have engaged in many major public controversies. What did I learn? Human society is not like the human body. When it comes to the body, you can discover cures for diseases through research and discovery. But, when it comes to the ills of society, there are no quick cures, no panaceas. There are no experts who have all the answers and who project sure-fire solutions to poverty, injustice, discrimination, inequity and a host of other afflictions confronting every society.
What we desperately require are leaders who are passionate advocates for social justice, but who understand that in a democracy the active participation of a majority is essential for social progress. To achieve a majority requires a willingness to consider the validity of divergent views, and to seek compromise. To the extent that I was involved in the deliberations resulting in the civil rights legislation of the 1960′s, I was involved in compromise. Martin Luther King himself was a great compromiser. But he never lost sight of the ultimate goal. He knew that future generations would continue the struggle, even as his efforts were grounded in the struggles of previous generations. Without the generation of Martin Luther King, would we have the generation of President Barack Obama?

Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was assassinated on April 4, 1968. Three days later, on April 7. 1968, my family attended a memorial service in his honor convened by the Washington, D.C.-area Jewish community and attended by more than 2,000 people. Because of their relationship, my father, was asked to deliver the eulogy. Below is an excerpt from that speech. Though my specific memories of that day have suffered the toll of time, the feelings remain with me as if it were 45 days ago instead of 45 years. And those feelings are sadness and loss, but also hope and promise.
“[Dr. King] made us look at ourselves in the light of eternity. He made us stand firm on our foundations. He showed us the gap between America’s promise and America’s fulfillment. He would not let us forget that there were human beings who were being treated less than human. From bus to waiting room to lunchroom to hotel room to voting booth to slum house to ghetto school to university campus to employment offices, he confronted us with the America we had refused to believe existed.
He shattered our illusions, but he restored our dream – the American dream. He helped us to see that our fundamental goal was not to make the world safe for democracy, but rather to make democracy safe for the world. And in doing so, he became our conscience. His pulpit was the street, his congregation all mankind, and his message universal.
And that is why he was struck down. The forces of hatred always seek to destroy our noblest symbols. But they seek in vain. . . . The assassins never learn that the symbol is more than a man’s body. It is a man’s life, his work, his deeds, his values. The destruction of the body only serves to enhance the value of the spirit. The wanton taking of life only generates new life for the forces of good. The symbol in death becomes more than the symbol in life. It assumes a new life, a new mission of its own. Freed from the frailties of the human body, it soars to new heights of influence.”A Florida couple is in some trouble.

Posted on January 25, 2013 at 7:17 pm.My biggest concern is with the logic that the toys drive children's decisions on what they want to eat. The underlying issue I have is that parents should drive the decision on what their children's options are - not the other way around.
I also find the decision riddled with hypocrisy as many of the jr high and high schools serve food that typically comes from a fryer. It seems to me if the county really wanted to make an impact banning fryers in public schools would be a more appropriate and effective step in achieving their goal.

It is more important today for companies who want to move in a foreign country must adapt their own culture to the dominant one (in the chosencountry); at first to respect the nation, but also to enhance their competitive advantage through cultural diversity.
Lots of theorists as Ricardo or Smith mentioned ideas about the notion of culture in countries, influencing international business.
Different definitions of culture exist, because many theorists are, or were interested in that point: “Culture consists in patterned ways of thinking,feeling and reacting, acquired and transmitted mainly by symbols, constituting the distinctive achievements of human groups, including their embodiments in artefacts; the essential core of culture consists of traditional (i.e historically derived and selected) ideas and especially their attached values. “ (Kluckhohn, 1951, p.86, n.5). (Hofstede, 2001, p.9). Tea time for example, is a traditionalvalue in Great Britain.
Culture is “transmitted and created content and patterns of values, ideas, and other symbolic meaningful systems as factors in the shaping of human behaviour”
(Kroeber and Parsons, 1958, p. 583)(Hofstede, 2001, p.9). Thus culture might be taught by someone who has already assimilate elements of culture.
Culture is “the collective programming of the mind that distinguishesthe members of one group or category of people from another” (Hofstede, 2001, p.9). Here, culture can be explained through religion. Believing in God or Yahve makes a difference between groups. “Rituals are collective activities that are technically unnecessary to the achievement of desired ends, but that within a culture are considered socially essential, keeping the individual bound within thenorms of the collectivity” (Hofstede, 2001, p 10), for example, religious ceremonies.
“Culture could be defined as the interactive aggregate of common characteristics that influence a human group’s response to its environment. Culture determines the uniqueness of a human group in the same way personality determines the uniqueness of an individual”. (Hofstede, 2001, p.10). “Culture is shared bymembers of the society and indeed defines the membership of the society”. (Griffin, et al., 2003, p85). Culture is a mean of acknowledgement between people and groups. People will recognize their group through specific, visible (or not) characteristics, constituting elements of culture.
First of all, the language: “the primary means used to transmit information and ideas” (Rugman et al., 2000,p.125), then, the religion: “Religions influence lifestyles, beliefs, values, and attitudes and can have a dramatic effect on the way people in a society act toward each other and toward those in other societies” (Rugman et al., 2000, p.128). Religions can have of course strong impact on every day life, but also on economy, and on the way people see work, money: “In United States, it is common to hearpeople talk about the Protestant work ethic, which holds that people should work hard, be industrious, and save their money” (Rugman et al., 2000, p.128). According to Weber, Protestantism is a religion which gives more the spirit of entrepreneurship, or a strong idea of working than any other cult. All those values are found in American culture: working hard to make money, and beingmaterialistic.
Values and attitudes are part of culture either, defined by “basic convictions that people have regarding what is right and wrong, good and bad, important and unimportant. An attitude is a persistent tendency feel and behave in a particular way toward subject”. (Rugman et al., 2000, p.128, 129).

Can't find what you're looking for?My car's just had a service and the report print-out says it's had the 45D3 parking brake recall applied as well as one numbered 90H6. Anyone got any ideas what this does? Google is drawing blanks. The only thing I've noticed is that the console display (not the MMI screen) is slightly different - it's got a more prominent clock at the top, the scroll-wheel-adjustable vehicle stats in the middle, and the lifetime and journey odometer readings at the bottom, whereas I used to have my speed in large digits at the top and the vehicle stats below. I'm not sure if that's just a result of a reset, though, and maybe I'd be able to switch that back to my original layout.Adolescence can be tough enough to get through without questions of sex, sexuality, and sexual identity. But adolescents are humans, too — no matter how alien they may seem to their parents at times.. It can help your child avoid devastating, and possibly life-threatening, errors in judgment.
“Above all, it is critical that parents be truthful, honest, and available to their children,” says Charles R. Wibbelsman, M.D., FAAP, Chief of Adolescent Medicine at Kaiser Permanente in San Francisco and a member of the American Academy of Pediatrics’ Committee on Adolescence.
“Parents often have their own agenda — don’t do this and don’t do that. But they need to take a step back and leave the judgments aside for this discussion,” says Warren Seigel, M.D., FAAP, Chairman of the Pediatrics Department and Director of Adolescent Medicine at Coney Island Hospital, Brooklyn, N.Y. “The most appropriate and important thing for a parent and a child or adolescent in dealing with questions about sexuality and sexual health is an open channel of communication.”
In today’s hyper-sexualized culture of Internet sites, mass media entertainers, and 24/7 programming, the traditional “birds and bees” lecture (or pamphlet handed to the child to read on her or his own) on reproductive basics is completely inadequate. Carefully preparing children for the normal changes in their bodies as well as the endless assault of peer pressure, media glorification of irresponsible sexuality, and advertising come-ons is the only way to create a sense of security for parents and children alike.
“There are a lot of things in the media that are not appropriate for a particular age,” says Dr. Wibbelsman, who is co-author of The Teenage Body Book and Growing and Changing. “We don’t put children on the street and wish them luck before sending them out on their own. We hold their hands. We educate them about the risks. And we trust them with increasing responsibility only as they’re old enough and show they’re ready to handle it.”
“The media particularly and everything around us talks about sex,” adds Dr. Seigel. “It’s hard to avoid it.”
The only foolproof approach to sexual safety, of course, is to say “no” and defer sexual activity until later in life. The good news is that as many as half of all adolescents do just that. But that leaves the other half at risk — many of them engaging in unprotected sex, exposing themselves to potentially grave disease and unwanted pregnancy.
“The most important thing to teach your child is responsibility,” Dr. Seigel says. “Discuss how to make decisions and understand what the consequences of decisions will be. You can start by discussing decisions and consequences that don’t involve sex, and then move the conversation toward sexuality.. What to do, then? It’s good to turn these encounters with the media into teachable moments.
“Seeing something in the media that is obviously sexually charged can be a springboard for conversation between adolescent and parent,” says Dr. Wibbelsman. “Is the ad bad or good? What’s the ad trying to say? Use this moment as an opportunity to teach and encourage, not to pronounce a harsh, dismissive judgment.. “I know it’s a lot of work, but parents need to monitor what their children see and be there, available to them, to provide some context,” says Dr. Wibbelsman. “Find out what’s in the movie, what’s in the program, what’s on that Internet site before you let your child see or hear.. “Let’s face it, we’re all embarrassed to talk about sex with each other,” Dr. Seigel says. “The easiest way to start is to be real with your adolescent: ‘This is really hard for me to talk about, and it was hard for me to talk about with my dad when I was your age.’ But it’s important to talk about, and we have to talk about embarrassing things sometimes.”
Keep reminding your child that you are in her corner every step of the way. “Never let them forget that your love is unconditional,” Dr. Seigel says. “Tell them, ‘I am here with you, and I love you and I will be here with you no matter what through all of this.’ Yes, it’s much easier said than done, but no less important.”
So what should you talk about? Perhaps start with how sexuality is portrayed in the media and, far more importantly, how it “works” in real life — the potentially bad consequences and catastrophes than can be a result of sexual activity, as well as the pleasure and positive results of responsible sexuality (remember: the job here is to be honest.) “You see a character in a TV show who’s made a decision with regard to sex,” Dr. Seigel says. “Start the discussion there, but don’t make it your soapbox. If you harshly criticize what you’re both seeing, your child will assume there’s no discussion to be had, and there goes your channel of communication.”
By approaching the topic carefully and conversationally, you and your child are much more likely to sort through the complexities together.
As your child matures — physically, mentally, and emotionally — opportunities will emerge for making regular discussions about sexuality part of your continuing conversation. Obviously, changes in your child’s body as puberty begins are crucial markers for such conversations.
One area that should receive particular attention is “urban myths” — bits of false information that “everyone” knows, passed along from adolescent to adolescent (and even from generation to generation: Don’t be surprised to find that your child has heard some of the same myths and misinformation that circulated during your adolescence). Make clear, for instance, that oral sex is not without risks, that unprotected intercourse without ejaculation is not effective birth control, and so on. “It’s very important to get the facts straight from the start, and share those facts with your child,” says Dr. Wibbelsman. “That builds trust, and that trust is critical to guiding your adolescent through these challenging times.”
In particular, be specific and accurate about the risks or pregnancy, the effectiveness (and limitations) of different types of birth control, and the variety of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and their effects. (See “Helpful Resources” at the bottom of this page for reliable resources of information on these subjects.)
One key area to emphasize is that no one has the right to pressure your daughter or son to have sex. Peer pressure — and the media pressure that often stimulates it — can be addressed by empowering your children with your belief in their ability to withstand such pressure, a sense of values that are more important than immediate gratification, and their absolute freedom to bring any concerns to you.
It is wholly natural for adolescents to have questions about sex and sexual identity. While attitudes toward gay and lesbian identity (among other issues) remain tangled and complex, the crucial thing to bear in mind is that all of us have such questions at one time or another. “Parents need to be open about that and understand the entire spectrum of sexuality and sexual orientation, and not try to funnel them into a particular niche or area,” says Dr. Wibbelsman. “Accept the adolescent’s questions as part of growing up, because that’s exactly what it is. But at the same time, let the adolescent know what your views and values are. Know the difference between facts and your opinion, and be clear about both.”
But how to do it in a way that helps keep the channels open? It’s a four-letter word, actually. “The key is to let adolescents know that you love them no matter who they become,” Dr. Seigel says. “They may turn out tall, short, heavy, thin, healthy, or sickly — but you’ll love them no matter what, no matter what decisions they make. That is much easier said than done for many parents, but that’s key to raising a healthy adolescent.”
And don’t hesitate to discuss values, morals, and ethics with regard to sex — without lecturing, but with guidance. By providing your child with a solid framework of information and values, you’ve taken a large step toward making sure that when he or she becomes sexually active it will be with the knowledge, preparation, and maturity that will mark the transition to sexual activity as an informed choice, not a risky accident.

However, a .exe file in the mail contains a hidden virus with a nasty payload.Websense said in a security alert that the .exe file connects to two servers in order to download additional malicious files. The victim's PC then joins the Bredolab botnet, giving hackers full control."This spam email attack is designed to play on the subject at the forefront of users' minds: their password security," said Carl Leonard, Websense security labs manager."Falling for this scam could lead to the unsuspecting user becoming part of a botnet. With the recent hack of web email accounts, users would feel more compelled to open an attachment that purports to hold their new password, as they'd be worried who changed it in the first place."Our advice for users is to always go directly to the web address you have an account with and reset passwords there."Graham Cluley, senior technology consultant at Sophos, confirmed that the malicious emails have been spammed out widely across the internet."The 'from' address has been forged, and the attached file is in fact a piece of malware. Sophos detects the malware as Troj/BredoZp-M or Mal/Bredo-A," he wrote in a blog post."Don't make life easy for the hackers hell-bent on infecting your computer, stealing your identity and emptying your bank account.

The plan was to use the assembly plant where the Plymouth Prowler were built to build a limited number of Brutes. Jeep had borrowed the Red AEV Brute prototype that was shown at Camp Jeep and were experimenting with the vehicle on the assembly line. Everything was a 'Go' until a last minute decision by some high executives, and the project was cancelled. In addition, Jeep approached AEV to have AEV produce the hardtop used on the Brute for the proposed new Scrambler. You can check out the AEV Brute here.

But what could be better than a warm, freshly made loaf of banana bread? Behold, I give you frosted banana bars. Moist, tender banana bars topped with thick, cream cheese frosting. Wow, these were so good. I had never had banana bars until a few weeks ago after a friend brought some over. I searched the internet for a recipe and realized there are variations of these beauties everywhere. Now that I’ve had these yummy treats, I admit I will be hard-pressed to use those icky, brown bananas for anything other than these bars. Delicious! By the way, my mom gave me this cream cheese frosting recipe a long time ago and I had yet to use it until now. I’ve never swapped out the butter in cream cheese frosting with whipped cream, but oh my, it was heavenly (remember I said heavenly not healthy). Just like the banana bars, I don’t think I’ll ever make cream cheese frosting another way!
Ingredients
- ½ cup butter, softened
- 1 ½ cups white sugar
- 2 eggs
- 1 cup sour cream
- 1 tsp vanilla
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tsp baking soda
- ¼ tsp salt

Kara – if you have a similar frosting recipe, you should let me know if you use granulated sugar or confectioners’ sugar. I like the result of confectioners’ sugar best because it isn’t as grainy but I would be curious to know how you make the frosting!

Gaye – oh no, sorry to make you sick to your stomach, but if it makes you feel any better, I was the same way when I made them. Thanks for commenting and letting me know they were a hit!
This recipe is great!! I got it from a woman that works with my husband. I’m not such a big fan of banana bread, but I could eat these day and night!
I think even my youngest would love these… simply for the icing! LOL!
Jenn, the issue with your frosting is partially my fault. I should have put in the frosting recipe that the cream cheese should be softened to room temperature. I’m sorry I didn’t include that! It probably would have made mixing it easier. Thanks for letting me know the results, though. I think you are right that the confectioners sugar will dissolve better – that is what I have found, too.
bananas are never wasted in my presence, and this looks to be a tremendous use for them. the first word that came to mind when i saw your picture was MOIST.
Ricki – good question. The original recipe called for white sugar but I found the result too grainy so confectioners’ (powdered) sugar works best because it dissolves better.
Dolores – wow, just your description of the salted caramel buttercream frosting was enough to make my mouth water! I bet it was fantastic. Thanks for commenting and letting me know!
Ooooooo. That frosting sounds divine. Both whipping cream and cream cheese! It’s gotta be good.
Yum yum! I call this “glorified banana bread”. So good and easy to make! Thanks!
I made these tonight to use up leftover bananas and sour cream. Topped them with a browned butter salted caramel buttercream from the most recent Daring Baker challenge. Yum! Thanks for sharing.
I made these this evening, and followed the frosting recipe, white sugar and all. I found that I needed to let the sugar and cream cheese sit for awhile to dissolve. Then I’d turn on the mixer every once and awhile to stir it up. Next time I will probably use powdered sugar–just to eliminate the waiting.
I am going to have to try these. I have been making a similar frosting for years and it is divine. Great on carrot cake, chocolate cake, pumpkin cake, and just about anything. Heck, I could just eat it out of the bowl, it’s that good!
Made these yesterday with my little girl. Oh my!!! They were delicious!!! We did not have the right size jelly roll pan so I made them in a 9 x 13 pyrex pan and lowered the heat so the bars were more like a cake. The frosting was amazing!!! I usually use butter in my cream cheese frosting and the whipping cream is so much better!!! I usually have great self control but I could not stop licking my fingers. I printed this recipe from allrecipes about one year ago and I am glad I waited to make it because the combination of the bars with this frosting is perfect. Thanks for sharing!!! I really enjoy your recipes and Aunt Marilyn’s.
Hi Brianne – so glad you liked these banana bars – I agree that the frosting is downright evil. Thanks for your comment!
Hey Mel!! these look divine! I’m curious, have you ever made these into cupcakes?? if not, how do you think they would turn out? how full do you think I should fill the cupcake liners???
I just thought they might be good as cupcakes with the frosting piped on top!
Hi Melanie – I’ve never personally made these into cupcakes so I can’t give you a heads up on how they would work. But as a guess, I think they would bake up fine and to be safe, I’d only fill the cupcake liners about halfway full. Let me know if you try them!
Just made these, another super star recipe! Fantastic!
Thanks, Melissa!
I just made these this afternoon and I couldn’t have been more thrilled with them! It took no time to throw it all together and have them baking. Every time I have a stray banana that doesn’t get eaten because it’s too ripe I peel it and throw it in a big ziploc in the freezer. That way I always have some on hand for smoothies and now I’ll have them on hand for this! The best part about having them already in the bag is I could just squish it all up inside the bag, snip a corner off and then squeeze it right into the mixer. They turned out insanely moist and fluffy and bananariffic (and yes, I’m pretty sure bananariffic is a word). The frosting was the perfect match for this. Now the question is: why would I ever make boring ol’ banana bread again??!
Reyna – well, of course I’m glad you liked this recipe and as always, thank you for checking in, but seriously, the best part of your comment was that I learned what to do with those onesie, twosie bananas that go bad. I know, I’m really slow, but I’ve never thought to peel them and throw them in the freezer. Brilliant. Feel free to send more ingenious tips my way.
Mel, I’m just glad to have contributed one little thing to make your life easier–though I will never be able to repay you for all the excellent recipes, great ideas and tips that have made cooking such a joy the past 6 months since I’ve found you!
Hey–I had a happy accident with these I had to tell you about. I wanted to take these to a friend the other day, and I had everything ready to go when I realized that I didn’t have enough bananas, so I used a cup of pumpkin puree, and added a tsp. of pumpkin pie spice and cut the sour cream back to 2/3 cup because the pumpkin puree is so wet. They only took 15 minutes to bake in the jelly roll pan. I made the same whipped cream/cream cheese frosting and they were sooooooo good. The perfect fall treat. I loved the light fluffy and moist texture. I will continue to make these with both bananas and pumpkin depending on my mood! I love that I have options!
Reyna – look at you, you little baking queen! I love your improvisations! It’s like a dual recipe: banana bars by day, pumpkin bars by night. Love it.
I was looking for a good banana recipe and decided to try this one. BOY am I GLAD I did. These are FANTASTIC!!! Easy enough for a non-baker (like myself) and delicious. This recipe is definitely a keeper.
Thanks Mel!
Thanks, Micki!
Just made these into some pretty awesome, moist cupcakes! Sprinkled with a dash of nutmeg and 3 candied hazelnuts on top. Recipe to be posted soon if you want to see how they turn out. Maybe next wk sometime….thanks Mel!
Really, really awesome! So moist! and the frosting is light-even tho super rich-doesn’t taste it!
This is a super good option over banana nut bread. No more soggy, under-cooked middle of the loaf!
Ok, just wanted to update- I finally posted those Banana Cupcakes recipe utilizing your recipe
Thanks Mel!

These banana bars are amazing. I didn’t change a single thing (and I’m the queen of substitutions) because I had a feeling they’d be just right. Well, they WERE perfect, although I had to cook them a bit longer due to my lame toaster oven. This recipe made two 8×8 pans plus six full-sized cupcakes… and I had a ton of icing leftover, probably because I made the cupcakes (cake to frosting ratio is a bit different with those) and I piped icing on top of individual pre-cut bars (instead of smearing it over the whole pan.)
The piped frosting looked awfully cute when I took the bars to two Memorial Day parties on Monday. At the first party where they were the only dessert, fewer than 8 people polished off at least a pan and a half of bars. Everyone was ooohing and aaaahhhing and moaning from the deliciousness. Thanks for making me look good. 😉
My only problem is, now I’m looking at the frozen bananas in my freezer (the ones I normally use for my protein smoothie) and thinking, “It wouldn’t hurt to make those bars again… right?? Maybe a half-recipe?”
Oh my this frosting is to die for! I made mini pumpkin cupcakes and used the frosting for them. Oh.my.goodness was it good. I need to try these banana bars soon.
Hi Mel,
I came to your site for an easy frosting recipe for a chocolate cake I’m making, and this looks perfect. Although I want to make it chocolate flavored. I’m wondering how much unsweetened cocoa powder I should add, do you have a suggestion? Thanks for any help you can offer! Jodie
Jodie, I’ve never made a chocolate version of this so I’m not really sure. If I were you, I might google search a chocolate banana bar recipe and see how it compares. If all else fails, start with 1/2 cup cocoa but you will probably want to decrease the flour a bit to compensate. Good luck!
Hi Mel, thanks for your response. I guess I should have specified I was wondering about making the FROSTING ONLY part of this recipe, not the banana cake. I wanted to frost a chocolate cake I was making for a party with this frosting, but I wanted to make the frosting chocolate flavored. I was wondering how much cocoa you would suggest to put in the frosting? Anyway if you have a suggestion, maybe I’ll try that next time. Since I made this cake yesterday, I used a frosting recipe that I make all of the time and everyone seems to love it. It’s SOOOOO easy!!! If you ever want to try it, here it is – there’s only 3 ingredients and it’s yummy!
INGREDIENTS:
1CUP OF COLD MILK
1 BOX OF INSTANT CHOCOLATE PUDDING (3.9 ounce) – not mixed according to directions on the box, just use the powder mix inside the box
1 EIGHT OUNCE TUB OF COOL WHIP – I use the “extra creamy”, it tastes better to me.
(or you could use 8 ounces of home made whipping cream)
In a mixer, beat together the milk and pudding mix until thoroughly mixed, about 2 minutes.
Then beat in the tub of coolwhip. (You may have to scrape your bowl a few times while beating together since the pudding mixture is thicker than the cool whip…the pudding mixture sometimes stays to the bottom of your bowl.)
Once they’re thoroughly mixed together, frost your cake! You can also use a vanilla pudding mix instead of chocolate if you want a vanilla flavor instead. Store the frosted cake in the fridge. Another secret: if you make a boxed cake mix, (which I’m sure is rare for you to do! LOL!) add 1/2 cup of sour cream in the cake batter along with all the other ingredients. IT MAKES IT SOOOO MOIST! People always wonder how I get my cakes so moist. You’ll have to let me know if you try this frosting and if you like it. It’s a very mild frosting and not super sweet.
Have a great day!!!! Jodie
Hey Mel, I was just wondering if you’ve tried this frosting recipe with Marscapone cheese? DIVINE!
Made it into a sheet cake, but served it cut up in little pieces and put a scoop of the whipped frosting on top, kind of like Cool Whip buts MUCH better! Loved the taste of the cake!
Overbought bananas last week, hence the buttermilk banana bread this week AND banana bars. These bars are SO good!! The frosting was really good, too, but in typical tonya fashion I messed it up. I will definitely make the frosting again, but next time we want to try the banana bars w/ the peanut butter frosting from your peanut butter texas sheetcake recipe (drool!!). As always, thanks for the GREAT recipe – we are swallowing these whole on this rainy Saturday!
Would this frosting be good enough for a cake? Would it be stuff enough or runny?
I meant stiff, sorry
Alina – this frosting is definitely on the soft, silky side of things so it definitely wouldn’t hold up well to piping decorations on a cake.
Great recipe! I didn’t have sour cream on hand so I used the fat free plain Greek yogurt and it substituted just fine. We also added chocolate chips to the batter, which upped the sweetness and eliminated the need for the frosting. Very tasty!!!
[…] Banana Cake with Whipped Cream Cheese Frosting (adapted from) […]
Has anyone tried to make these bars ahead and freeze them? I am thinking that the bars should be frozen without the frosting, and then the frosting added later.
I made these last night and they were scrumptious. Better than banana bread. Thanks for sharing. I am excited to try more of your recipes. I already have a list!
[…] Banana Bars with Whipped Cream Cheese Frosting […]
I made these this morning to bring in to work but made it in a smaller 11×9 pan and called it banana cake. After initally making the frosting and testing it I wasn’t that impressed. But as it rode in my 3degree car, blasted frigid temperature, it changed and by the time I had a piece I loved the frosting! I’m so glad I decided to keep the little 1/2 cup that was left over and put into the fridge. It’ll be my dessert tonight.
Oh and everyone at worked loved it too. A guy who doesn’t like bananas had 2 pieces.
I had 3 bananas to use up so I thought I’d see if you had a recipe for something with bananas other than banana bread. I made this and we are all enjoying it. I added 1 tsp. cinnamon to the batter because I love it in my banana bread. It gives it a little something without being overly noticable. Also, I always add some banana extract along with the vanilla in banana bars, cakes and breads. It really helps give a more “banana-y” flavor. I had half a bag of Moana Loa dry roasted macadamia nut pieces that needed to be used up so I sprinkled them on top of the icing. Yum! Thanks for a great base recipe that I will make again.
Oh my gosh – make these tonight! I had a can of Pillsbury cream cheese frosting and “cheated” on the frosting. I can just imaging them with coconut in the frosting or German chocolate cake frostings, or just plain, or with confectioner’s sugar dusting, or….
Made these this afternoon for dessert, didn’t change anything, and they are WONDERFUL! My kids were fighting over who got the biggest piece, it was a little ridiculous but they loved them so much.
–Doubled the bars so I could freeze one pan (unfrosted). If for any reason they do not freeze well I’ll post back but they should be fine.
–The frosting is perfect and I’ll be using it for other recipes from here on out. If you are a light-froster you really only need to make HALF the frosting recipe and you’ll still have more than enough.
–Instead of mashing the bananas with fork I processed them just a couple pulses to make smooth and the texture is awesome.
Coincidentally we had your Chicken Corn Chowder for dinner followed by these for a Presidents Day dessert! Thanks so much for your blog!
These were deeeevviiiine! Made the recipe exactly as written except used a 9.5 X 13.5 pan… The rest of the batter? Well we ate it straight from the bowl like banana pudding 😛 The only thing id do differently was decrease the whipped cream 1/4 c because I really like cream cheese frosting :))
I made these about two weeks ago and my husband, daughter and I ate them all in two says. A shame, I know. I even forgot to add the sour cream! ( Pregnancy brain) Then I made you cream cheese pumpkin muffins and shared with a friend who when I told him about these he was upset I didn’t save some of these for him too. He doesn’t know how hard it was to save him the pumpkin muffin! These banana bars are just…….SOOOOOOOO good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!BTW, I am 7 months pregnant and finding your blog is one of the BEST things to have happened to me! I LOVE food, LOVE IT!!!! And am so excited to have access to these wonderful dishes with such simple ingredients. I am a mom on a budget and my husband eats some of these meals and desserts and says to me ” This tastes like something you could order at a nice place” I just say, “See why I am always on that site” Thank you!
This recipe is so incredibly good. The bar to frosting ratio is perfect. And that frosting, by the way, is some of the best I’ve ever had. I am not the type of person who usually craves frosting on its own, but this delicious, amazing stuff I could just eat with a spoon from a bowl. It takes everything in me to stop sneaking tastes of it before I put it on the bars. Thanks for sharing this! (And thanks for filling me in on the ingredient amounts that I was unable to read off of my computer a few months ago. I’ve already made these more than once.)
I can’t get your recipe for banana bars with whipped cream cheese frosting to print.
Any suggestions? I would love to make these. They sound delicious. Thanks/
Jan –!
hi mel, well i just found this recepie and im about to try it! but, i was wondering if i could turn them in to cupcakes. my concern is if i would still have the same result or the extra minutes in the oven will produce a different texture in the batter or affect its moistness. ive been searching for a good recepie that makes a good, spongy, moist banana cupcake but nothing has come even closer to that. the main problem is in the texture, too dry or too dense (because of the banana). pleasee help!
also, i was wondering for how long does the frosting lasts because whipped cream even refrigerated is quite delicate and i would love if you could share some tips on how you keep it stable and stiff and how should i store the bars to keep them as fresh and good a possible! thank you soo much!
Danielle – I’ve never tried them as cupcakes so you will have to experiment. I’d cut down the baking time a bit. As for the frosting, I’ve left it in the fridge for a day or two with no problems. With the cream cheese in it, it tends to do ok in the fridge for a day or so. If you want a stabilized whipped cream (that doesn’t release a bit of liquid), you might need to google a recipe. Good luck!
Does the frosting require refrigerating after applied?
Jody – Yes I usually refrigerate these after frosting them.
I have a very similar recipe for banana bars, however I use a different frosting and often times I just cut them smaller, put the “frosting” in the middle as filling and top with another piece of the bar. Here’s mine (I’m a peanut butter lover so most of my desserts incorporate it!) 8 oz cream cheese, 1 c powdered sugar, 1/2 c. peanut butter, 1/4 c. milk, 1 smashed banana, and 4 tsp. cocoa powder. Very rich, but very good. Thanks for all your recipes, you’ve given me new inspirations!
Thank you so much for sharing this recipe! I have made it several times (by request) in just the last 2 weeks. I think it is my family’s new favorite!
These are wonderful. I put a vanilla bean in the frostng and Wow!
These look divine! But I just want to make them for our family…so could I 1/2 the recipe and put it in just a 9×13 pan? Thanks Mel! Also, your recipe for blueberry cheesecake pie is featured on our new blog!
Hi Kate – thanks for the recipe feature! You could probably halve this recipe in a 9X13-inch pan but the bars will be a bit thinner – just watch the baking time!
I made some subpar banana bread today, so I wish I had these instead!Ontario hog farmers are being asked to tighten biosecurity measure to prevent a deadly pig virus from spreading further. (Handout/The Canadian Press)
Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne said on Tuesday the province will immediately commit $2 million to the Ontario pork industry to help offset costs of dealing with a deadly pig virus.
Wynne said the province will also establish a separate and dedicated biosecurity stream for those in the swine industry.
Hog farmers can apply for funding until March 13.
Ontario hog farmers are being asked to tighten biosecurity measure to prevent a deadly pig virus from spreading further.
Officials said yesterday that a second case of pig epidemic diarrhea has been confirmed and a possible third case is being investigated.
- 2nd case of deadly pig virus confirmed in Ontario
- Eastern Ontario pork producers brace for deadly pig virus
But they insist P-E-D does not affect food safety and is not a risk to human health.
The disease has killed millions of piglets in the U-S and producers here have been bracing for its arrival.
A group representing Ontario's hog farmers warns that should the virus reach other provinces, the country's pork industry could lose some 45-million dollars in just a year.
Ontario Pork says P-E-D is transmitted through contact with manure and producers should make sure trucks, trailers and people are cleaned and disinfected before they arrive on a farm.
Wynne will hold a conference call with national and provincial agriculture ministers Thursday. They will discus a national approach to the virus and talk about what Ontario is already doing.
Wynne said it needs to be stressed that Ontario pork is safe to eat.Detail Information

The way you feel about your breast reconstruction will depend partly on what you expect from the surgery. Make sure you discuss your expectations with your surgeon before you decide to go ahead. It’s important to wait for several months after surgery for the reconstructed breast to settle into its final shape, before deciding how happy you are with the result. Full healing can take about a year. It often takes more than one operation to get the best appearance for reconstructed breasts.
If you have concerns, discuss them with your surgeon or breast care nurse. Your surgeon may be able to offer an operation to improve the result. If you are still unhappy following discussions with your surgeon you can, if you wish, ask to be referred to another surgeon for a second opinion.
Back to Having breast reconstruction
If you have had or are about to have breast reconstruction, we have information about what to expect.
An important part of making your decision about breast reconstruction is having realistic expectations about the result.One has to wonder whether Wendy's (NYSE: WEN ) will ever get hitched.
Shares of the country's third-largest burger chain fell 5% yesterday after posting disappointing fourth-quarter results. Income from continuing operations climbed 42% higher to $0.16 a share during the period, or up 24% to $0.21 a share after backing out restructuring-related expenses from both quarters. Wall Street was expecting a profit of $0.23 a share.
Total revenues clocked in flat at $596 million, with franchised unit gains offsetting slight dips in sales, comps, and the unit count of its company-owned restaurants. Wendy's also failed to wow shareholders during its third quarter.
This would be acceptable if the fast food industry was in a slump, but several of its burger-flipping rivals are doing just fine. Burger King (NYSE: BKC ) has posted positive comps for 16 consecutive quarters. McDonald's (NYSE: MCD ) may have had a flat December, but it too grew its comps for the quarter. More importantly, Burger King, McDonald's, and Sonic (Nasdaq: SONC ) all beat analyst profit targets in their latest quarters.
The slump comes at a terrible time. Wendy's has been seeking "strategic options" since last April. Now that it has sold off its Cafe Express and Baja Fresh concepts and spun off Tim Hortons (NYSE: TMI ) , the company is riding exclusively on its namesake chain.
Wendy's isn't hideous, so where are the suitors? Weren't private equity firms and Arby's-parent Triarc (NYSE: TRY ) angling for Wendy's last summer? That enthusiasm seems to have gone the way of the Frescata (discontinued) or the red wig campaign (on the way out, replaced by a softer ad with an animated version of the Wendy's character).
Because financing concerns have been keeping privatization offers in check, Wendy's may very well have to go it alone. It's doing what it can, via aggressive share buybacks and gradually rolling out breakfast throughout its chain. However, it has to be disheartening to see comps fall at its company-owned stores despite the addition of the earlier breakfast hours at some of those locations.
Wendy's must have thought that it was holding a hot hand last year, especially after its shares climbed past $40 shortly after going public with its plans to smoke out a suitor. However, now that the stock has shed nearly half of its May highs, it turns out that Wendy's wasn't playing poker. It was playing Old Maid.
It's the wrong game at the wrong time. Shareholders hoping for a fresh deck will have to be.You want to learn more about mbanking bri?

Randy's father is the 7th Angis of Ouroboros.One of Randy's monikers is "Son of the War God." One of the only unnamed characters so far who would match that description is the 7th Apostle, who's said in 3rd to be an even better swordsman than Loewe.
- Jossed by scans. Say hello to Arianrhod!
Alternatively, Randy's father is the 4th Angis.The WMG says itself. Explanation: The 4th Angis has the same speech pattern as Randy's. Assuming that it's "family habit", it isn't too far-fetched to assume that Randy's father speaks like his son.
- Jossed by Ao: He's been dead since before Zero started
In the sequel, our party will pull off a four-member Combo Craft.How to improve on the already awesome S-Crafts and Combo Crafts from Zero? By making all four members of the SSS unite for a super awesome double Combo Craft!
- Sort of. Burst is more a special mode than a C-Craft but it kind of works out the same in the end.
Everything past the battle in IBC is a dream.I always think that the ending is really far too happy to be true, i mean Ke A just accept her origin so easily and went to school with the whole squad as her parents? That's too unrealistic. So i think that some part after the battle in IBC is a dream, it's so obvious even in the first part of the game we're shown to Lloyd having a dream about the last fight. That dream, is the reality. The fact is, Estelle and Joshua never appeared to help Lloyd and the others, as the result Ke A was taken away and Randy, Tio and Elie died. Everything is Ke A dream, because she can't accept the truth even right now, Ke A is still in the sphere keeps dreaming about the good times and with her own ending. In the real word, Lloyd as the only survivor still tries to find and rescue Ke A, and this is Ao no Kiseki plot.
- That would also explains why it is called Zero no Kiseki, bacause it led to "Zero", the ending is "Zero" or "Never happened", Ao no Kiseki is the real game all along.
- Nautrally, completely Jossed by Ao itself. The reality of the situation is even crazier.

You only have to do this if you don't have access to invoice prices. If you have the invoice price then it's that + 500-1k for dealer + taxes/fees.
If you are a USAA member buy the car through them. They negotiate a very good price for you, and you just walk in to sign the papers because deal was made before you walked in the door!
When/if you trade in your old car, don't use it as part of the deal. Make the car purchase a separate deal. After a price is finalized and agreed upon, then attempt to sell them your used car. let's say your car is worth 2500. The dealers will inflate the sticker price of the car you're interested in and then tell you they're giving you a 5k trade in value when all they are doing is taking your car for nothing.
If they don't want to buy your car after you make the deal on the new/used car you purchase then sell it privately afterwards.
Also don't get anxious at the dealer or fall in love with a car. You can walk away from any deal. There's enough inventory out there that another car that you like will show up in the area. Walking away from a car deal is harder if you're younger so good luck if you're under 25 trying to do this on your own.

I was like I'M EATING A LOT OF FUCKING CAKE TODAY. I had already been a few months primal, mostly low-carb and had lost quite a bit of flab. I fully expected to have something negative happen but I actually lost a few pounds, perhaps due to the massive amounts of carbs/sugar I ate that day.
Gotta agree here, in that if you schedule "Cheat Days", it just sets you for a fall(i.e. Stalled weight loss). Being Primal is about living healthy/happy/free of CW. if you cheat(20%), no biggie, just start back again on being Primal. We all have cheats. Try to make them Primal(lots of GREAT recipe ideas here), and as stated earlier, you will start to crave those CW foods less and less. Good luck, and Grok On!
I make it optional; I do tend to eat higher carb on Saturday, but neither I or the SO go crazy like we used to with the restricted foods. And after last Saturday, when a slice of bread pudding gave me mild abdominal cramps for three days, I'm going to have to sadly acknowledge that my "cheat days" need to be more strict on the gluten grains.
If you're good with rules and requirements, a cheat day can work. Both my SO and I are big on self-discipline, and I am fairly adamant that if it ain't Saturday and it ain't primal, it ain't going in my belly.
Awesome post-Cheat Day story. We went to California Adventure during Cheat Day and myMike had a bowl of pasta (really his only non-paleo food item that day). Next day, he got on the scale and was five pounds heavier. He got off, walked over to me, and said in a completely deadpan voice, "F--k pasta."
That's why I love him.

My Primal Meanderings
The only way I've been able to lose weight consistently (2-3lbs/ week) has been with adding cheat days. But I think the most important part of this is that during the week, you have to undereat. You can't just be eating all the primal foods you want and then gorge on cheat days. You have to deplete your glyocogen so that when you cheat, there is no overflow which would turn to fat. The reason slow carb diet works is because during the week, calories and carbs are very low.
What I do is IF M-Th. I eat 1 or 2 meals a day. Usually salmon and greens or beef and veggies. Very low carb and very low calories for the day. Then Fridays and Saturdays I up my calories as much as I can and eat as much carbs as i can. I stay primal. Sundays I play it by ear. i'm usually too full to eat more then 1 meal on Sunday. By Monday I'm happy to go back to my IF and eat less.
I have found that eating this way, I've lost all cravings for food and snacking. I literally have to force myself to eat more on weekends.
I've experimented with different ways of eating. But this is the only way that I've been able to guarantee a 2lb lost per week. I've lost 15lbs in 2 months since I started eating this way. Oh and I'm hardly ever hungry even on my 1 meal days. Oh and I crossfit 4 days a week. But I was doing that before and didn't lose a single pound. So it is the eating that determines weight loss, not the workout.
My husband and I only started a few weeks ago too, around 5 like you, and we had our first cheat night on Sunday night. We ordered a pizza and wings... and while it all tasted very good, we both felt sick all night afterward. He had a lot of stomach cramping. I felt like vomiting, and just had an overall feeling of being unwell. We will be trying something else next time we have a cheat day. Non-primal pizza is not on the menu again any time soon!
I think it really depends on the individual. If you're 20 and significantly overweight, it might not matter much to have one cheat day (assuming you still avoid gluten). If you're 50 and just a few pounds away from your ideal weight, you're probably going to stall. Add in the relative health of your body, how long you've been eating Primal, what your workout was that day, how high your stress level is... it all depends.
Me? I try not to plan cheat days. The way my mind works, I'd be fantasizing about them all week, and that would set me up to eat stuff I shouldn't even before my planned "cheat".
I don't have entire "cheat days" anyway. One meal or food or party or whatever is plenty, at least for me. And when I do eat stuff that's less than optimal, I still avoid wheat.
Seriously, a few days ago I ate some pretty large meatballs because a friend of mine was craving Italian food for lunch. I completely forgot that the usual way to make meatballs is with breadcrumbs because MINE don't have any. Before I even got home, I was bloated and gassy, and the next morning my body had thrown a temper tantrum by gaining almost 5 pounds overnight.

Motive for fatal Leicester house fire still unknown
Five people have been arrested by detectives investigating a suspected arson attack on a home in Leicester that killed a mother and her three children.
Leicestershire Police, though, have said the motive for the blaze remains unknown after they found no evidence linking the family to a fatal assault on a man in the city on the same night.
Dr Muhammad Taufiq lost his daughter, his two sons and his wife in the suspected arson attack and has spoken of the pain of losing his entire family.
ITV News' Lewis Vaughan-Jones reports from Leicester:
Three women and two men have been arrested in connection with the fire, Leicestershire Police confirmed in a statement:
The grieving Dr Taufiq earlier made a "passionate" speech to around 1,500 worshippers during prayers at his local mosque.
Imam and teacher Muhammad Uwais, who was at the Jame Mosque in Spinney Hill, described this afternoon's speech:
Dr Taufiq later made a short statement to the media, in which he said he hoped that justice would prevail following the tragedy.FIGURES have revealed that police in Hampshire responded to more than 100 cases of children committing sexual offences against other children.
In the past two years officers have dealt with 110 cases where under-18s have been accused of carrying out sexual offences against other children and young people.
The figures have been collected by the NSPCC which is “deeply concerned” with the scale of the problem across the country, where more than 8,000 under-18s have been accused of such offences.
Hampshire police has welcomed the charity’s campaign to highlight the complex issue and believes that prevention is the key to tackling the problem.
The national study by the NSPCC found that most offenders were male, but that there was a small proportion of female offenders as well as both male and female victims.
Crimes included serious sexual assaults, rape and obscene publication offences.Hallelujah! Finally, there's a way to keep our apple a day fresh.

Liebestod: Love and Death
The title of Yeats's unpublished play conjoins sexuality and death – a pairing that Yeats and other writers and theorists have argued is an inherent part of human nature. Love (Eros) and death (Thanatos) – or the erotic drive and the death drive, as Freud identified them – lie at the root of human desire. In Yeats's words, "the desire that is satisfied is not a great desire," because desire itself is determined by the absence or unobtainable quality of the love object. 1 The association of love and death, called Liebestod, takes its name from the final aria in Wagner's opera Tristan und Isolde and assumes a number of forms in literature. As Elizabeth Butler Cullingford explains, the love-death link appears when "the poet loves a dead woman or a deadly woman" or two lovers "die in each other's arms or their love is consummated after death." 2 The Liebestod is consensual, as distinguished from sadism or masochism, in which male eroticism is often stimulated by female victimage. Although the trope in Western poetry has tended to be gender-specific – the male poet desires (the death of) a female partner – the imbalance of power is not as pronounced as it is in other representations of sexuality and death. The emphasis in the Liebestod is on desire – unsatisfied, infinite, continually reproducing – and not on violence; the death is meant only to prolong the bittersweet yearning for the beloved, which if fulfilled, would cease to have as strong a hold over the poet who voices this desire.
Yeats returned to the Liebestod time and again in his poetry and drama, including the early verse plays, linking love and death often as a means of negotiating his unrequited feelings for Maud Gonne. According to Cullingford, Yeats associated sexual passion with annihilation and consoled himself with the thought that Gonne would be accessible to him in death: "The dead woman, unlike the living one, can be imaginatively possessed forever: she is incapable of change or self-assertion. Love poetry, like elegy, frequently feeds on the obliterated subjectivity of the person who occasions it." 3 Cullingford cautions us again reading Yeats's poetry in too narrow a biographical context by linking his use of the Liebestod with his ongoing pursuit of Gonne. Indeed, the frequent association of love and death in Yeats's work is evident even to the casual reader, and it provides a lens for interpreting the early verse drama. Like Percy Bysshe Shelley, whose poetry the young Yeats deliberately imitated, the quest for love in nearly all of Yeats's early plays ends in death – the death of the lover, the death of the beloved, or in the case of Love and Death, the death of everyone on stage in the final scene. This is a pattern that Yeats borrowed from Shelley's Alastor. In George Bornstein's words, "Earthly love alone does not satisfy either the Shelleyan or the Yeatsian lover, who longs for ideal completion." 4 The impossibility of satisfying his (or her) desire leads the lover to accept, even embrace death as a compensation and an escape.
George Frederic Watts, Love and Death, 1897. Oil on canvas, 283 x 150 cm. Tate Britain, London.
This is evident in Love and Death in Ginevra's suicidal pursuit of Sintram, an immortal "Spirit Hunter," whom no human can behold. After witnessing the deaths of her companions in the final scene, Ginevra beseeches her lover to remain with her – to draw closer, although she knows his presence will ensure her own death. Her final words and Yeats's closing stage directions, consistent with the Liebestod, imply that Ginevra is joined with Sintram in death. She pleads, "come we will go / …we will together go," and her death is indicated when the phantom fades. Reversing the gender roles of Yeats's later love lyrics, the play features a woman who is by turns lovesick – occupying the role usually reserved for the male poet – and sinister and murderous. Ginevra exercises control over the men in the play, murdering her father, King Ralph, and thwarting Moscon's attempts to avenge Alice's death. But as if he is threatened by this display of female power, Yeats dramatizes her death, allowing her to narrate the process until the end. Elizabeth Brewer Redwine notes, "Yeats brought this trope into his poems as well, but his love elegies contain only his own speech; the speaker in the poems is the courtier/lover describing the woman's death." 5 The Liebestod works on two levels in the play: first, the female protagonist and her immortal lover presumably consummate their love in death; but on a second level, the playwright dramatizes the death of his heroine, curtailing her power and fixing her in place in a move that parallels the male poet's desired "possession" of his dead female beloved. The conventional balance of power is restored, and in these final lines, we witness perhaps Yeats's earliest exploration of the love-death link.

How will they live with themselves?
EDITORIAL: JURY HAS SPOKEN
Tension was as thick as the Florida pea-soup air after the jury reached a decision in this nearly six-week trial, deliberating less than 11 hours. That’s barely long enough to recover from a chemical peel. Casey had stretch marks that hung around longer.
Normally, a quick verdict signals guilt (Martha Stewart). But it soon became clear that this panel had made up its mind long ago. Why deliberate at all?
Casey began to cry when “not guilty” was read, over and over and over again. But then, she did something we hadn’t seen before. She cracked a small, sphinx-like smile. A little laugh.
Her daughter is dead, found decomposing in a Florida swamp. She didn’t report her kid missing for 31 days. She never shed a tear.
What’s more, her lawyers made the fantasy claim that Casey was molested by her father and brother since age 8 — a story so desperate and without foundation that even the judge told jurors not to consider it.
And Casey Anthony chose this day to celebrate.
“She just got away with murder,” said observer Pam Santiago. “Like O.J.”
Like O.J. As in the O.J. trial, a sequestered jury stopped listening. But evidence told the tale of a selfish, bored and overwhelmed lady just itching to get out from under the demands of a small child.
In O.J., defense lawyers played the race card. It meant a conviction would represent a personal threat to the jury: Someone could falsely accuse you of murder.
Casey’s lawyers clearly read the O.J. playbook. They played the Mommy Card, painting the ridiculous picture of a loving mother who made mistakes. They claimed Caylee drowned in her grandparents’ pool, one of countless excuses Casey whipped out while trying to explain why her daughter was missing. But jurors had to believe it. Doubting Casey would have been a threat to any parent on whose watch a kid was ever hurt.
No matter how rotten a mother one is — and Casey should win an award for Brood Mare of the Year — it is difficult for people to believe a woman is capable of taking the life of her own flesh and blood.
The truth is that some mothers don’t love their kids. Due to selfishness or horniness or narcissism, the child we find so adorable is a speed bump on her way to getting a new tattoo.
As surely as Casey was a bad mom, another child will be killed.
Will anyone believe the mother did it?Image Unavailable

The forecasts show that temperatures are supposed to drop to dangerously low levels for the next several days. Make sure you have plenty of fuel, extra blankets and endless amounts of hot chocolate!
Below are a few reminders and tips to help you avoid frozen pipes and heating issues in your home throughout these cold temperatures.
Keep your home heated to a minimum of 66 degrees. Keeping your thermostat at a consistent setting, even when you are not at home will ensure adequate heat and require less demand on your heating system to bring your home to temperature.
Keep cabinet doors open below sinks. This will allow warm air to flow to the pipes beneath and work to help prevent pipes from freezing.
Keep doors between rooms open to allow warm air to circulate.
Keep furniture away from baseboard heaters or heat duct exchanges to allow warm air to circulate.
Identify main water shut-off and know how to operate it in the event of an emergency.
When the weather is this cold, who wants to go outside? Check out these fun things to do while stuck inside in the winter. Days inside can be fun, especially when you have the perfect home to escape the cold from. If you are in the market for your perfect home give us a call and we will help find you the perfect home for all the seasons in Vermont!

# # #Since retiring the space shuttle program in 2011, NASA has been trying to privatize the U.S. space industry. In 2010, the Obama administration created a public-private partnership plan, called the Commercial Crew Program (CCP), to help the U.S. develop spacecraft that can transport astronauts to the International Space Station and other low-Earth-orbit destinations. NASA has three American partners -- SpaceX, Boeing and Sierra Nevada -- on board for the CCP. However, Congress did not provide the space agency with its requested funding for the CCP this year, thus delaying U.S. launches until 2017. In the meantime, NASA struck a $424 million agreement with the Russian Federal Space Agency to continue using its crew transportation services until 2016, with return and rescue services extending through June 2017.Context Relevant CEO Stephen Purpura can’t tell you the Wall Street firms that are buying up his company’s predictive analytics software.
Too much money is at stake.
That’s because the big data offerings developed by Purpura’s 26-month-old Seattle startup have already become a serious competitive advantage in the financial services arena, and most of the firms don’t want the secret out.
But word seems to be getting around the venture capital circles, with Context Relevant announcing today that it has raised $21 million in funding from a group of investors that includes San Francisco-based Formation 8, as well existing investors Madrona Venture Group, Bloomberg Beta and Vulcan Capital.
Context Relevant must be doing something right, since the investment round united the owners of two of the most bitter rivals in professional football: Paul Allen and Vulcan Capital’s Seattle Seahawks and Gideon Yu of Formation 8, co-owner of the San Francisco 49ers.
The Context Relevant board meetings could get very interesting, with Purpura noting that he “can’t guarantee that all of our investors will win the Super Bowl every year.” In fact, Purpura said he successfully pitched Formation 8 while attending a Seahawks-49ers game at Candlestick Park last season.
It’s a bit unusual seeing a Seattle startup making inroads on Wall Street. But Purpura loves the West Coast mentality that his company’s big data scientists are bringing to the problem.
The company is currently taking data feeds from Bloomberg, and then mixing that information with data from financial institutions, allowing them to offer better recommendations to clients about what products to buy.
 declined to name how many individual customers it has or who is using it. However, he did offer this example to better describe Context Relevant’s offering, and what it is doing on.”
Context Relevant raised the cash because Purpura said they need to hire people to help meet demand for the products. Total funding in the 30-person company, which has recently opened offices in the Bay Area and New York, now stands at $28 million. The company has budgeted to hire an additional 100 people over the next two years or so.
“The exciting thing for Seattle and the company is that we are seeing growth — especially in New York City — which is much larger that the vast majority of our competitors,” said Purpura. “Our investors are incredibly excited because we just do things that big data has promised for a long time, but not delivered on.”
While Context Relevant is making inroads on Wall Street, there’s a lot more in store. And that’s part of what got Formation 8’s Jim Kim intrigued.
“The team at Context Relevant is at the leading edge of productizing data science for the world’s premier financial organizations, with many adjacent markets still to come,” Kim said in a release.
Context Relevant was featured last December at the GeekWire Gala as a “Seattle 10″ company, one of the most promising up-and-comers in the region.

By Michelle Van Rysselberge
Lariat Staff Writer
The next millennium is a mere three years away. The approach of the 21st century appears to be coupled with an increase in apocalyptic cults and bizarre events.
Last week, 39 Heaven's Gate cult members packed their suitcases, shaved their heads in crew cut styles, dressed in black and drank a deadly cocktail of applesauce, phenobarbital and vodka.
The group committed suicide in hopes of boarding a spacecraft trailing the Hale-Bopp comet. Heaven's Gate used ads and their Web site on the Internet to inform the public of their beliefs and urge people to join them.
Nearly four years ago, the Branch Davidians, who also committed mass suicide, believed the world was coming to an end.
Jim Jones led more than 900 people to Jonestown, Guyana, in 1978 to commit suicide using Kool-Aid and cyanide.
These groups are just a few of the cultic movements that have received publicity in the past couple of decades.
The approach of a new millennium will increase apocalyptic cult activity just as it did before the year 1000, according to experts. Two major groups during that time period included the Bogomiles and Cathari, said religion professor Dr. James Breckenridge.
There are three definitions for the word cult, Breckenridge said.
The first is a religion perceived by some people as strange or odd. Another definition is a group perceived as a threat to society and normal life as we know it.
A final is a group that claims to be a true form of a religious tradition, but most people in that religion would say the group deviates from our tradition in a significant way through their teaching and practice, he said.
'A characteristic of a cult is a leader with a lot of personal appeal, charm and charisma,' Breckenridge said.
'The leader appears to be quite bright and knowledgeable and is an authoritarian who knows how to manipulate people. He or she has the answers to the meaning of life and many times makes the followers feel special.'
Cults are either secluded from or active in the mainstream of society. In both cases, the group holds secret beliefs and practices that are hidden from the public, Breckenridge said.
When people think of cults, many times they conjure up images of crazy people. Just mention the Branch Davidians and most people make jokes about crazy David Koresh.
'Anyone can join these groups whose lives don't have a sense of purpose - you don't have to be crazy,' Breckenridge said. 'Many cults have intelligent people who are well-educated and from affluent backgrounds.'
The Heaven's Gate cult is an ideal example of this viewpoint. They were a highly intelligent group of computer programmers who created web pages for companies.
Anyone with an Internet service provider can use the Internet for any purpose. No one can stop cults from using the Internet, said David Seago, analyst and programmer and University webmaster.
'It is left wide-open,' Seago said.
The Internet is a neutral medium just like television and radio. It can be helpful if used to inform as well as harmful, Breckenridge said.
'It creates a need for a great deal of wisdom about how to handle the information,' Breckenridge said.
Book describes
Davidian raid
By. 28, 1993 to serve drinks and snacks to law enforcement and media personnel.
His involvement allowed him to pass through the blockades that brought him up to about 1,500 yards from the law enforcement command center.
Robert's book offers his theories as to why the raid took place and interviews with individuals who were never questioned by investigators.
Robert photographed the events as they unfolded at the compound, and of the 104 pictures in the book, 100 have never been seen before.
Beyond the Flames is available in Waco bookstores and the Helen Marie Taylor Museum of Waco History. The book can also be ordered by calling 1-800-295-3737 or visiting Robert's web site at.Olympics chief: No guarantee Saudis will send women athletes to London

Judy and Diane,
I went back to the doc, and my leg has shown some good bone growth. Im now off the crutches, and using a cane mainly for balance. The doc is making me keep the boot on as an added precaution in case I slip. Ill probobly use the cane for the rest of the month. On bad days it will be one crutch.
Its great walking without the crutches!!!!!!!!
Im stumbling a little bit and limping, so Im using Friday and the weekend to get my balance back a bit and will be back at work on Monday.
Only possible problem is the rod shifted a little in the leg and I may need to undergo more surgery to get it removed if it causes problems. Its a likely possibility I need to prepare for, so when I may be a bit preoccupied when I get back (no stress, No Stress!). What theyll do is open me up again and pop the bone out and slip the rod out. Im scared of this, because the pain was really, really bad. But Ill cross that bridge when I come to it.
I feel great though!.
This place was absolutely AMAZING! We had a group of 10 that stayed and we all had the best time ever. It is a perfect location on the beach. Right next to Walmart so it was easily accessible. It was about a 10 minute drive from Pier Park so it was easy to get to too. The view is absolutely breathtaking! Very spacious and very beautifully decorated. It felt homey for all of us and we loved it! Mary was very easily to access and very helpful with everything. She was always there to answer any questions we had and she always tried to help us with anything we asked for! I would recommend staying in this place to everyone! Us girls loved every second!
We took our grown kids and their spouses for a week's getaway on the beach, hoping for a good bonding experience. This beautifully decorated condo exceeded our expectations and we had a wonderful time. The 4 bedrooms, each with their own bathroom provided privacy for each couple while at the same time the living space allowed for talking, playing games and watching movies. The oversized balcony was awesome and had enough furniture to accommodate all 8 of our party. The views were amazing! The kitchen was very well stocked and we cooked our meals everyday to save money for activities such as mini-golf, giant maze, renting a pontoon boat to go to Shell Island, and shopping. Although the weather wasn't great for swimming, we did enjoy beach volleyball and searching for seashells and sand dollars. Parking was convenient and covered. We experienced NO problems with the elevators. It was a very quiet complex and super convenient to everything. One of our party flew in to the new local airport which is only about 20 minutes away. Thank you, Wayne and Mary - you were wonderful to work with; very professional, while being friendly and personable. We hope to come back when the weather is warm so we can fully enjoy the balcony and the beach! God bless you!
We just got back from staying at the Ocean Ritz for 5 days and it was incredible! The rooms were excellent and very clean. We had absolutely no issues to complain about. The spacious balconies are out of this world! Both our rooms were decorated nicely and we had everthing we needed. Nice location and convenient to restaurants, Walmart and the grocery store. Owners and management did an incredible job making sure everything was just as described. We will be back!
We stayed in Mary's condo in Aug, 2012. We had a great time at the condo with lots of room and bed. the room is beautiful decorated. Mary is so nice and helpful starting from the time that we are looking for vacation room, during the time we stay there and after we left (We realized that we forgot to take our computer charge cable on the second day after we got home. We called Mary. She arranged a person to look for us, found it and mailed to us). I want to say thank you to mary and we will be definitely going back.
Our Ocean Ritz unit it centrally located on Front Beach Road and there are many attractions and restaurants
located nearby.

Mount Prospect,Haitian tragedy reveals -- and creates -- more Minnesota connections
The Onion satirized America's general ignorance about Haiti in an article titled "Massive Earthquake Reveals Entire Island Civilization Called 'Haiti,' " which is funny, but, at the same time, for Minnesotans, what the earthquake in Haiti revealed was both that residents of our fair state have enormous resources of compassion for the country and an unexpectedly deep connection with it.
A surprising number of Minnesotans were in Haiti when the earthquake hit, including Macalester professor Joëlle Vitiello, who Joe Shansky interviews for the TC Daily Planet. "[T]his happened in the first week of a carnival season," Vitiello explains. "During Carnival, there are neighborhood bands that go around singing and having offerings. So you could hear them going from neighborhood to neighborhood and see them in the hills."
The Associated Press offers up a story that illustrates Minnesota's complex relationship with Haiti, telling the tale of Blaine resident Betsy Sathers, who lost her husband when the I-35W bridge collapsed. At the time, she thought she might be pregnant. She was not, and that compounded her sorrow: "I was grieving the loss of my husband and the family we had hoped to have together." After the earthquake, Sathers adopted twins from Haiti. "I don't think I rescued them," she tells author Jeff Baenen. "I feel like if anything, they've rescued me."
Additionally, the Minnesota Legislature is pushing through a bill to make donations to Haiti tax deductible for 2009, as mentioned in Monday's Glean. The bill has now been approved by the legislative tax panel, and, according to the Associated Press, is expected to pass rather quickly, with bipartisan support; the previous sentence, by the way, is one that seems to show up less and less in news writing, and it feels good to write it.
That being said, one expects a forthcoming proposal from Gov. Tim Pawlenty is likely to enjoy support from both sides of the aisles, if only because politicians like to show that they are tough on crime, and the crime Pawlenty is addressing is an especially despised one. According to the AP, he will be pushing for longer sentences for sex offenders. There are currently no details about the proposal available, leaving us at the Daily Glean curious. After all, new legislation is always instigated by something. Was there a study that Pawlenty read that made the case for longer sentencing? Was there some recent, heinous crime from a sex offender who had just been released? We do not want to be cynical about such a thing, but so much of Pawlenty's recent behavior has been geared toward fleshing out his resume for a presidential bid, and we would just hate to think he's playing politics with sentencing guidelines exclusively for the sake of bolstering his national rep.
While we're on the subject of reputations, Minneapolis Mayor R.T. Rybak, who hopes to replace Pawlenty in office, seems to be solidifying one. Unfortunately, that rep is as a "bundle of contradictions," as City Pages boils it down. They're referring to a story by Governing Magazine called "Radical Renewal," which looks at Rybak's unusual attempts to encourage financial growth in Minneapolis. Rather than simply offer tax benefits to big business (which is a common technique for governors looking to goose the economy), Rybak's approach seems to have been to offer those benefits to small, local businesses, often in blighted areas. The story reads like a walking tour of Minneapolis, starting at Midtown Global Market, as the author, Josh Goodman, describes the various compromises in his campaign promises that Rybak has made, as well as many of his successes.
Of course, Minneapolis mayors are bound to be a little contradictory; the story reminds us that the Mill City has a weak-mayor system, and so anything the mayor does is generally accomplished by persuasion and compromise. It's got to be a bit hard for a new mayor to figure this out, but, fortunately, as the Fresh.mn blog points out, there is actually a handbook for Minneapolis mayors. It's called, appropriately enough, The Minnesota Mayors Handbook, and can be read in PDF form here. The booklet is rather enjoyable, in part because it's written with the sort of breathless prose one associated with how-to books written for teenagers in the '50s. An example, from the introduction: "It’s easy to understand why a person would be excited about becoming a newly elected or appointed mayor. It’s a terrific hallmark in one’s life. Serving a city says a lot about a person’s sense of public responsibility!"
There is a billboard in Wyoming, Minn., that has been bedeviling Minnesotans. Minnesota Public Radio's Bob Collins witnessed it with his very own eyes, and publishes a photo: The billboard offers a photo of former President George W. Bush, along with the words "Miss me yet?" His post generated considerable partisan bickering in the comments section (sample: "When you look at all Obama's failure, Bush wasn't so bad!"). FOX9 suggests a reason it may be so perplexing: The billboard is vague about what it means, leaving people speculating "whether the roadside sign was an indictment of President Barack Obama's performance so far or a reminder of Bush's unpopularity." It really is a pickle!
Here's an update on a story that's been kicking around for a while. You might remember Todd Lappegaard, a former Minnesota police officer who lost his job after a video got out that showed him pressing a Taser to a suspect's neck, apparently unprovoked (video of the incident). Well, according to the Star Tribune's Matt McKinney, Lappegaard believes his firing was the result of his department caving to public pressure, and undeserved, and he wants his job back. McKinney's story looks into the case against Lappegaard, which is quite interesting; for instance, on Lappegaard's own records, he had used his Taser 11 times in four years, but his Taser itself keeps records of how many time it is fired, and his had sometimes been fired several times per day. Lappegaard says these were tests to make sure the Taser was working properly ("They make it look like I'm out there electrocuting anybody and everybody that I possibly can," he complains). The man Lappegaard Tased currently has a $400,000 lawsuit against the city.
The Star Tribune's David La Vaque looks outside the world of professional sports and finds quite a story in Columbia Heights boys basketball and football, in the person of Toby Frisby, captain of both teams. High school hasn't been easy for Frisby, who was homeless for long stretches of it, which he seems to have worked his way through with the equanimity of a Taoist master. "As stuff got more difficult, I realized that stuff isn't always going to be easy and you have to make the best of what you've got," Frisby tells La Vaque. "The whole time I would think, 'This is just temporary. It's not going to last forever. There's stuff ahead of me.'"

Re: Longer prison sentences.
Does the governor suggest bonding for the construction of yet more prisons? Or might he contract with private prison providers?
Or might he, shades of common sense, plan to make space available by reducing the sentences of marijuana users/recreational drug users and offering newly arrested persons at least a choice between a sentence and residential treatment.
Here we go again....I agree with bunny's apprehension regarding Pawlenty's new found interest in sentencing guidelines.
That's right, I agreed with leftists *twice* this week....will I be joining group hugs to squirt tears about how unfair life is next?
Not likely.
It is my understanding that not only do sex offenders already receive lengthy sentences, they are required to keep cops informed of their whereabouts for life; they are often incapable of finding somewhere to live after leaving prison; they are required to stay clear of anywhere kids congregate and unless I'm mistaken, they can be held in secure hospitals indefinitely if they are deemed an unsatisfactory risk for release from prison.
There is nothing more execrable than a predatory pervert, especially those that harm kids; don't get me wrong....but if society really needs greater protection, why not just stand them up against a wall right after conviction and be sure?
Nope, I'm sure.
This has the same aroma that the cacophonous crusade against drunk driving, pit bull dogs, cigarettes, cholesterol and the internal combustion engine exudes....ripe politics.Sound Off for November 13th: Should Idaho teachers still receive merit pay bonuses?
Idaho teachers will still get about $38 million in merit-pay bonuses this year, despite voters' rejection of public schools chief Tom Luna's education overhaul.
The Idaho attorney general says the failure at the polls shouldn't affect the payout..
Luna says he hopes to resurrect a portion of his "Students Come First" package during the 2013 Legislature, including merit pay.
Do you feel teachers should still get their merit pay bonuses even though Prop 2 was overwhelmingly voted down?
Or do you agree that they earned them during the 2011-2012 school year before the law was voted down?

On Saturday night, Midwest fighter Chase Beebe gets a second chance at becoming a champion as he moves down from featherweight to bantamweight to take on WEC Bantamweight Champion Eddie Wineland for the title. Beebe is largely unknown by mainstream MMA fans but he hopes to change that come Saturday night. Beebe sat down with MMAWeekly to discuss his MMA career and upcoming title fight.

Beebe: I’ve been training at Gilbert Grappling with Joey Gilbert, the Guida brothers and with my primary training partner Tommy Lee. I also train at a wrestling school with Mike and Clay French since its closer to home.
MMAWeekly: You fought Matt “Sunshine” Fiordirisa at XFO 12 for the XFO Featherweight Championship, even in losing a decision you gained a lot of new fans. Tell us about the fight and how it affected your MMA career.
Beebe: I really learned a lot from that fight. It was a three round war and I did great for the first two rounds but I was totally exhausted for the third round even though I thought my cardio was great. I learned what it took to fight a war and it showed me what I needed to do to become a real fighter.
MMAWeekly: All nine of your wins have come by submission; tell us about your progression as being primarily a wrestler to becoming an MMA fighter.
Beebe: I’ve developed more after wrestling to become better rounded and complete my entire game. I primarily like to get mount on my opponents and start landing strikes, eventually they give up their backs and I lock in a choke.
MMAWeekly: You’re fighting Eddie Wineland at WEC 26 for the WEC Bantamweight Championship, how did the opportunity come to be?
Beebe: My manager Chad Bergmeier helped push hard for me to get this fight a lot. I have been working hard and I knew that the chance would come up someday, that is why I always work to improve my skills.
MMAWeekly: Can you give us your thoughts on the fight?
Beebe: I expect to go out there and bang with him. I’m comfortable with my striking and a lot of punches are going to be thrown from start to finish, it’s going to be an all out war.
MMAWeekly: Wineland is known for his striking and you’re primarily a ground fighter. What kind of training have you been in preparation for the fight?
Beebe: I’ve been working with a really strong Muay Thai coach, who has taught me how to take leg kicks. In exchange for his training, I’ve been teaching him wrestling and submissions. I’ve also been doing a lot of cardio training and I think that it’s ten times better than it was before, so I’m prepared to fight a five-round war if I need to.
MMAWeekly: You’ve fought at 145 pounds for your entire career. Is making 135 pounds going to be a challenge for you?
Beebe: It’s going to be a bit of challenge because I’m not fond of cutting weight but I’ve wrestled for my whole life, so I’m an expert on how to cut weight. This isn’t the worst situation I’ve been in when it comes to cutting weight and I have an entire twenty-four hours to recover from cutting weight, whereas when I wrestled I only had about an hour to get ready.
MMAWeekly: Thanks for talking to us at MMAWeekly; any closing thoughts?
Beebe: I’m sure that you guys won’t be disappointed with the pace of the fight. No matter what happens, it’s going to be an exciting fight from start to finish.Susan Blackwell hangs out with The Book of Mormon’s Rory O’Malley for her latest Side by Side shenanigans, which includes an explosive backyard cook-out, sharing fond memories of college and an impromptu Otis Redding singalong.

Designed, Developed and Maintained by ARISIraqi officials say Islamic State (IS) militants have destroyed a lock on the Euphrates River that served as a bridge in Ramadi as pro-government forces close in on the militant-held city to the west of Baghdad.
Iraqi forces have nearly surrounded Ramadi and have been moving into some neighborhoods of Ramadi, the capital of Anbar Province, during the last few days.
Iraqi Major General Ismail al-Mahlawi, the head of the government's military operations in Anbar Province, said the lock was the last remaining bridge from Ramadi's city center leading to the northwest.
He says the destruction of the bridge has left about 300 IS militants cut off and trapped in the city center.
IS militants seized Ramadi in May.
Backed by U.S.-led coalition air strikes, the pro-government forces earlier this week recaptured a military complex north of the city and a neighborhood on the city outskirts.

dont go there if you drivePosted Sep 5, 2009 on Hotels.com
if you are driving you will have problems parking. get a hotel with free parking otherwise what you save will be easily spent on parking not to mention the extra walking you will do. if you get there you will not have a way to check in, its an apartment. you will have trouble meeting the agent, we did. I chose this over another that offered free parking and free breakfast, I think what i paid in Parking and food made this a much more expensive place. AND LOTS OF WALKING TO THE GARAGE WITH THE LUGGAGE.

excellent apartmentPosted Aug 10, 2009 on Hotels.com
The apartment we stayed in for 3 nights was excellent. It was in immaculate condition and plenty of space for 4 of us. It was good value for money. It was a short walk to the Moorish area, cathedral and central restaurants and shops. It is walkable to the Alhambra, but maybe not in the heat of summer. Main disadvantage is that it is difficult to find (huge one way system that wasn't marked on our maps, difficult back streets with no road names and it is up a back alley)and you can't really bring a car up to the accommodation. We had problems getting the keys because we were later arriving than planned (due to problems finding the place) but they did pay for a hotel we had checked in to as a result.

Great Location and KitchenPosted Jun 26, 2009 on Hotels.com
Very close to all sights and train station. Access to a kitchen and washing machine was great in the middle of our trip to Spain. Climate control does not mean air conditioned. Would not recommend for a stay in July or August. Contact owner in advance at the phone number given to arrange key pickup.

Great location and good valuePosted Jun 4, 2009 on Hotels.com
Firstly once u get there you need to call a number ... this was answered by a man who did speak a little english and sent the cleaner to the door. She didnt speak any english but showed us around and since it was bout 9:30am she hadnt yet made the beds .... however she was kind enough to do this straight away whilst we grabbed a coffee. These apartments are great , we stayed in the duplex B which was plenty of room and could quite easily live there if there was a balcony with a view. Dont let this put u off thou as it is very centrally located perfect for bars and cafes and just enough away from the any noise. The only draw back was that the towels werent changed nor any maid service for the 3 days we stayed there. However there is a washing machine, fridge freezer and cooking facilities (i.e. a proper kitchen!) should that be your bag. I would definately recommend this place and will seriously consider staying there again when i revist granada.

Centrally located, newly remodeled apartmentPosted Apr 7, 2009 on Hotels.com
The apartment appeared to be newly remodeled as it was in near new condition, with a clothes washing machine that had the instructions inside the washing cavity still in the sealed plastic. The apartment is located literally minutes from the historical attractions and there is a food store nearby as well as restaurants. It is an excellent apartment and very comfortable. But there is no one on location and we had to wait about 10 minutes for the delivery of keys after we telephoned. And auto parking is not complimentary, contrary to the advertisement and it costs 20 euro per day at a garage about 1,000 meter nearby.

intéressant avec des boules kies et des pinces nezPosted Feb 25, 2009
les appartements sont bien situés en centre ville. Tous de grande taille et très propre. Plusieurs problèmes que les gérants doivent régler : la récupération des clefs à l'arrivée, les remonter d'odeurs d'égout dans la salle de bains (puanteur constante) et pour finir l'isolation phonique qui est catastrophique. Si les touristes qui n'ont pas trop d'argent veulent un appartement bon marché à Grenade, libre à eux... nous tenterons un autre hôtel la prochaine fois... un peu plus cher peut être et un peu excentré mais plus confortable. bonne chance à tous ceux qui iront dans cette ville magnifique en tout cas.Myprimemail.com is the 132493:th largest website within the world.

In the U.S. we take for granted that most people know what the Internet is and have a general sense of what it can do, even if they don’t use it themselves. However, even in the U.S., there were (and still are) people that don’t know what the Internet is.
In the Caucasus, not knowing what “the Internet” implies is not uncommon in some places – 1% of Armenians, 22% of Azerbaijanis, and 7% of Georgians report that they don’t know what “the Internet” is (in 2010).
Who are these people? They’re older, they’re rural, they have less education, and they’re poorer.
And, generally, people that are not aware of what “the Internet” is are highly unlikely to ever use the Internet.
The next step is ever using the Internet. In Armenia, two-thirds of citizens have never used the Internet, a little over half (55%) of Azerbaijanis have never used it, and 61% of Georgians have never used it (in 2010).
Again, the people that are not using tend to be older, more rural, less educated, and poorer.
Finally, the last Internet hurdle is frequent use. Many Caucasus “Internet users” are getting online less than once a month. Certainly these infrequent users are not fully benefiting from Internet use. 10% of Armenians, 11% of Azerbaijanis, and 11% of Georgians are online quite infrequently.
So while official statistics from the ITU say that 37% of Armenians, 36% of Azerbaijanis, and 27% of Georgians are online because they define “Internet user” as going online once or more ever, I’d argue that this is adoption, and we should really be discussing frequent users (at least weekly). In that case, 21% of Armenians, 9% of Azerbaijanis, and 18% of Georgians are fully benefiting from Internet use.
Who are those frequent users? They’re generally urban (although in Armenia and to some degree Georgia, there are some rural frequent users, mostly via mobile Internet), better educated, younger, and wealthier.
At least we can see that there has been an increase in awareness, use, and frequent use since 2009. In 2009 71% of Armenians, 62% of Azerbaijanis, and 65% of Georgians knew what the Internet was, and 15% of Armenians, 14% of Azerbaijanis, and 17% of Georgians had ever used it. Frequent users in 2009 were 8% of Armenians, 6% of Azerbaijanis, and 10% of Georgians.

Based on the island of Lombok, Suryaman told Reuters that 10 people had been rescued after the ship sank on its way from that island to Komodo Island.
The official said he did not know the fate of the other 15 people on the vessel, which had a crew of five Indonesians and was carrying 20 foreigners.
The vessel left Lombok Thursday night and sank Saturday about 7 p.m. local time (8 a.m. EDT), “and we only received a report at 8 a.m. [Sunday],” said Suryaman, who added that poor communication caused a delay in deploying a search-and-rescue team.
Local fishermen rescued five people before the team arrived, he said. The official said that among.

Autophagy is a process by which cancer cells recycle essential building blocks to fuel further growth. Block this pathway with the antimalarial drug hydroxycholoroquine (HCQ), the authors found, and the BRAF inhibitors will be able to do their job better.

In a recent interview with PEOPLE, Hunter talked about his second big hit and admitted who the song is about!
"She knows the song is about her, and I give her a hard time, but we laugh about it now," he said not giving away the girl's name.
"I knew it wasn't going to work because she wasn't into the relationship thing, but I wanted to try anyway," he said.
"The song was an attempt to say, 'Let's see how it goes. I know I'll probably get bummed out, but I will take any time with you.'"
Hunter also admitted their split wasn't as bad as it might seem.
Either way, we wonder who the lucky girl is and what happened between the two of them?!

Every evening he would say, “This hasn’t been one of my better days.” My husband and I both tend to run on an even keel, but when one of us has had a bad day, we find ourselves telling the other, “this hasn’t been one of my better days.” That’s both a private joke and a reminder that we are, in the bigger picture, blessed in ways my father couldn’t imagine.
Having said that, yesterday was not one of my better days. It started with the tedious business of cleaning and wrapping paintings to go to RIT-NTID’s Dyer Art Center. (I clean every painting with Winsor & Newton’s Artists’ Picture Cleaner before it’s shown.) From there I went into my shop to make frames.
I love making frames almost as much as I love painting, but yesterday I mangled everything I touched. I made a perfect frame out of some luscious gilded stock, only to realize I’d mis-measured the painting. I had some lovely gunmetal frame stock I’d used for previous figure shows, and I cut a frame for my 36X60 nude and glued it, only to discover that I didn’t have a clamp large enough for it. I ran to the hardware store, which was out of the screws I needed, and ran home with mending brackets, with which I supported and reglued it. Frankly, it looks pretty bad.
Why am I messing up left and right? I want to go to Massachusetts to see my daughter this weekend and if I’m not done prepping for this show, I have to stay home. When I mix family and work, the ante rises fast. I don’t have a solution to this problem, nor would I want to. We should care more about our family than our work.
Meanwhile, my husband (he’s a programmer) went back to his office at 8:30 PM because he has a project that isn’t working and he also wants to go visit our kid. Some times, you just have to keep your head down and weather the storm.

The caravan was dirty, poorly maintained, holes in carpet and sofa's. The swimming pool was out of use due to a problem. The site become water logged in the rain. We left a day early as we had a very disappointing short break, this was our last family break before our new baby was born and it was ruined by a poor choice of site.
Caravan was lovely and clean, site was ok but alittle bit out of the way, not much within walking distance. Pool was clean and a decent size, club room seemed alittle cramped
Unfortunately the park and vans need some serious money spent on them. The facilities desperately need updating and a bloody good clean. Disappointed that the prices dropped dramatically - difference of £150 From what we paid. definitely will not be booking ahead of time again. On a plus side entertainment team were fab.
Booked cheap last minute holiday which was good value for money. the gas fire was not working and this was reported early in the morning it was still not fixed when we returned approx. 6pm no one had been to look at it. Some other guests had huge row in middle of night disturbing everyone. they should have been asked to leave site.
fine as we were visting family near by
had a great week and we r back next year love it
Myself,husband and 2 children stayed here over Easter.I have to say it was better than expected,caravan was comfortable and staff were very friendly.great position for lots of walking to Dawlish or Dawlish Warren.lovely little pubs too!' Would go again for sure.
We booked 2 ten berth gold plus caravans for our family holiday ,but feel they were not up to the standard of the previous caravans we had stayed in on this site which were also gold star plus...ie only one toilet per caravan
Superb staff quiet park if thats what you like caravan amazing
Fantastic stay at Dawlish sands, only small problem a lot of noise at night when people leaving the club. We bought my dogs with us and he loved his first holiday. Booking for next year already.
We were very disappointed with the facilities at the park. The swimmingly pool had no separate area for spectators, one public, cold rinse off shower and no private cubicals or areas to change.
The bar and entertainment area was too small, there was never any free tables to sit at and was unpleasantly dirty.
Had a very good Easter weekend . Flexi-dine good value very good food and nice and hot with very good service
did not pay much for this stay, if we had we would have complained.
Crampt and tired
Our check in time was 2pm we arrived at 2.30 and the caravan was not ready, we got our keys at around 3oclock ish. The park was very basic and the club quite small. We were a little disappointed that the restaurant was again small and inside the club. The games/arcade section was as you entered the club and there was only a few.
We have stayed in other parks in Dawlish Warren and were very pleased so would rebook with one of those.Forums > Company > Xerox

Finishing up an internship right now- looking for some places to apply if I'm not to receive the full time job offer. Is anybody familiar with MRC (Mr. Copy)? It is listed as "A Xerox company"- does it have the same reputation/value on a resume as Xerox? I am looking to apply for the Account Executive position as well as a few other sales positions with companies. Any thoughts on MRC?

t. kilgore splake | the poet tree
t. kilgore splake is a one of a kind, post-Beat, small press poet, with a romantic streak bigger than his beloved UP of Michigan and a body of work unrivaled by most of his contemporaries. You can set your clock by the deliberate, measured pacing of his free verse machinations and if you don’t love the soul of this man, well, have I ever got some overpriced, upscale, academic poetry I’d like to pawn off on your dismally pretentious ass.
splake’s poems are like missives, journal entries from a fading, too-soon-to-be-gone world. What he loves, what he wrestles with, who he is, is all there, right in the poems. As someone who came late to the ”profession” (the first two definitions of that word say it all: ”1 : the act of taking the vows of a religious community 2 : an act of openly declaring or publicly claiming a belief, faith, or opinion” i.), one of his major themes is his ongoing battle with ”dame muse” or ”damn dame muse.” The declarative nature and gender of this theme are telling. His heroes are championed throughout his work: Richard Brautigan, Hemingway, Harrison, the Beats, Vonnegut, Bukowski … the list is long and his admiration unflagging. Even his name – kilgore from Vonnegut, splake, as in a type ”trout,” a simultaneous tribute to Mr. V’s great character and the trout swimming upriver from the Brautigan mythos, and the t., well, I’m not telling about that – is collage as homage. He is a great lover of the outdoors, a fisherman, an inveterate hiker of the nearby Cliffs, an excellent photographer, and a man of decided opinions.
Oh, and did I mention: he is a wonderful poet.
There have been many fine collections of his work throughout the years, including poetry, prose, and photography. He has been championed by many such as Jim Chandler of Thunder Sandwich, whose interview with the poet is a great place to start for the uninitiated. Though his work may not appeal to all and, if we are honest, whose would, those who are attracted to it grab tight and hold on.
It is with great pleasure that I received in the mail recently a beautiful little chapbook, published by Henry Denander’s Kamini Press of Stockholm, entitled The Poet Tree and Other Poems. Though splake writes well in longer forms of 1, 2, and more pages, this tiny little volume concentrates on one of his greatest assets: the short poem, 15 or so lines or less. Here is the opening salvo:
divinity
red thimbleberries
like Jesus’ blood
chartres stained glass
In 3 short lines is captured quite a bit of what splake is about: the beauty, and his fascination with, nature, a drop or two of sacrilege, and an all pervasive appreciation of art.
No mean feat, as it took Proust 7 lengthy volumes and over 1.5 million words to capture what Splake sketches in a telling 9 words.
He can capture himself, too, with a stark honesty, in this poem putting the photographer’s precise eye to fine effect:
coming into spring
young pretty girl
espresso and laptop
conglomerate café morning
window table voyeur
while bears still sleeping
somewhere under snow
Here the element of nature is transmuted into an almost haiku like epiphany. Like his old friend and fellow poet, Albert Huffstickler, splake has a thing about coffee shops, often chronicling them in his verse. Spring, by the way, is a big, if brief, thing in its coming to the UP.
There are ups and downs in his work, emotional swings of elation and depression, characteristic of many an artist. One of the ways the poet has chosen to deal is to go head on and wrestle the angel:
cojones time
”sunlight here i am”
bukowski
muse long gone
blank page contests
past distant memories
destiny in hand
hot chivas rush
bardic blood boiling
brain skull cavity
distant grey fog
dull hum-hum-humming
.357 ticket to ride
spared nursing home
score tied
overtime eternity
Like Ginsberg & other Beats before and after him, splake chooses to shed all articles in a rush to catch the rhythm of meaning, the click-clack sound of spirit riding, riding, straight into the midnight heart of It All. Yes, there is darkness and there is much light, there is the ultimate beauty of life and what is.
Norbert Blei, at poetry dispatch and other notes from the underground, did an excellent recent post on splake, replete with poem and an essay by the poet on what exactly ”the poet tree” is. To tempt you over to this essay, here is a picture I lifted from there:
You can get a nice signed edition of this beautiful little chapbook with over 30 of splake’s finest poems for a mere $9 from Henry Denander at Kamini Press. I highly recommend it.
Of course, I’m biased. The poet and I have corresponded for nearly 20 years, him sending me envelopes full of xeroxed articles of books of interests and poems, his and others, I sending back and commiserating over the collective doom of his much-loved Cubbies and my much maligned Buccos. Yes, baseball is another shared romance of a bygone era, two old fools on a virtual park bench lamenting the way it was.
And my bias goes beyond this epistolary friendship of the non-electronic variety. My friend has honored what I do, if only by association: imagine my true and happy surprise to read this, the title poem of his collection, for the first time in this chap:
poet tree
denander drawings
lilliput poems
tibetan prayer flag colors
suffering autumn storms
vanishing in winter blizzards
buried until spring
to be born again
Of course, it is possible that lilliput is just a modifier here, signaling the diminutive nature of the poems on the tree and in this collection and has nothing to do with Lilliput the magazine (4 splake poems from previous posts) at all. But I’d like to think differently, especially since it was italicized (of course, there is that other Lilliput) and knowing how splake love’s to refer to the things he enjoys.
Yes, I believe I’ll think otherwise, mistaken or not. Don WentworthThis was the vision of how the Dolphins would play when general manager Jeff Ireland and coach Joe Philbin crafted their blueprint back in February. And through two joyous Sundays, the Dolphins and their success-starved fans are watching that vision come to life.
The man behind center has made the biggest jump of the second-year quarterbacks, exactly as offensive coordinator Mike Sherman predicted.
The defense is creating more turnovers.
Brent Grimes has been a significant upgrade over Sean Smith as a No. 1 cornerback.
Dannell Ellerbe and Philip Wheeler are making a bigger impact than predecessors Karlos Dansby and Kevin Burnett.
The offense is more explosive, even without tight end Dustin Keller, a key piece of the offseason overhaul.
“We got a helluva team in the making,” Philbin told his players, voice rising, after Sunday’s win in Indianapolis. “It doesn’t get any better than that!”
Yes, it’s a small sample size, too soon to form any definitive conclusions or print playoff tickets.
But this is the best the Dolphins can justifiably feel about themselves since 2008, even more so than 2010, when Miami opened the season by winning at Buffalo and Minnesota but finished 7-9.
Also consider this: Since 1990, 63 percent of NFL teams that start 2-0 make the playoffs.
“Miami, you’ve got a football team to go ahead with your basketball team now!” Tony Dungy announced on NBC Sunday night. “I think Miami’s legit.”
And Jimmy Johnson said on Fox: “The Dolphins are pretty good. Really physical front.”
There will assuredly be adversity through this journey, including defensive tackle Paul Soliai’s knee injury in the fourth quarter Sunday.
Question mark
Soliai’s availability for Sunday’s game against Atlanta is in question; the Dolphins aren’t sure yet whether he will be able to play. But the injury is not believed to be season-threatening.
“We’re not certain how Paul’s condition will be as the week goes on,” defensive coordinator Kevin Coyle said.
If Soliai misses a game or two, Randy Starks would resume starting alongside Jared Odrick. But Soliai hopes to be able to play Sunday.
What’s the most uplifting sign so far, aside from the 2-0 record?
It has to be the growth of Ryan Tannehill, who produced a subpar 76.1 quarterback rating as a rookie. He now stands at 94.6 after two games, which ranks 14th — ahead of Robert Griffin III (89.6), Drew Brees (87.4), Joe Flacco (78.1) and Tom Brady (74.1), among others.
“Ryan’s play speed is a little bit better,” Philbin said. “He’s seeing things on the field a hair quicker.”
Tannehill, who ranked in the bottom third or quarter of the league in most offensive categories last season, now ranks in the upper half in most.
He’s 10th in completion percentage, 12th in yards, ninth in average gain per completion and sixth-best in interceptions.
“Having gone through an NFL season and an [offseason program] as a starter, he has grown into the position, has tremendous confidence,” Sherman said. “He shows me great composure when he’s on the field.”
The Dolphins’ vision of fielding an offense with quick-strike ability materialized on their first drive Sunday, when Miami needed just 2:19 to travel 58 yards in six plays, punctuated by Mike Wallace scoring on an 18-yard catch and run on a screen.
“That screen was set up for Mike if we had the right look. If we didn’t, it would have gone to the other side,” Sherman said. “It’s predicated on what the defense is giving us.”
Defensively, the Dolphins believed Ellerbe and Wheeler would make a greater impact than Dansby (now with Arizona) and Burnett (Oakland), and Sunday’s game offered some evidence, with Wheeler’s sack ending the Colts’ final drive.
Ellerbe had 14 tackles in the game, Wheeler 12.
“Their play speed has been good, blitzing has been good,” Philbin said. “They’re aggressive. They’re off to good starts.”
Said Coyle: “They fly around, play with great energy. They play at a very high tempo. We’re really pleased with them.”
Nice pickup
And Grimes, who had a key interception in the fourth quarter Sunday, looks like the Dolphins’ best cornerback in years.
On Monday, he tried to downplay Sunday’s game against Atlanta, which did not re-sign him after last season.
“He has played well, fit into the scheme well,” Philbin said.
Still, for as much praise as Philbin dished out in his news conference Monday, he is pushing his players for more.
“The film tells us there are major areas of improvement that have to be addressed quickly,” he said.
But let’s be clear: There is satisfaction internally about the blueprint coming together so quickly.
“It looks good right now,” Wheeler said. “It’s a great confidence builder. We feel like we can beat anybody.”Lovely clean room, comfy beds, lovely breakfast. Based in the heart of Killarney town.would recommendS S S S S Catherine Quinn - United Kingdom (April, 2015)

Kelly Cutrone is apparently going to have her own talk show (shudder) and when asked what kinds of things she’s going to cover on the show she said:
There’s a lot of stuff I want to talk to young women about, but I don’t think I should go out with those first. One of the things was, a young girl said to me—this is kind of risque, so I don’t know if you guys wanna hear it—she was like, can I ask you a question? And I said, sure. I thought she was going to ask me, like what should I wear to my prom? But she asked me, how do you give a really good handjob??
You really want to read the whole quote, I promise. She has some very deep thoughts about placentas.

The Miami Marlins (22-21) and San Francisco Giants (27-16) will continue a National League series on Saturday night at AT&T Park, with the first pitch scheduled for 9:05 p.m. ET
Miami Marlins vs. San Francisco Giants
Miami has alternated wins and losses over its last four games, as it comes off a 7-5 victory over San Francisco as +124 road underdogs Friday, while going OVER the betting total for a eighth consecutive contest. Outfielder Giancarlo Stanton’s hitting streak ended at 17 games when he finished hitless in five at-bats last night, as he hit four home runs and collected 13 RBIs over that span. Miami is 4-4 as road underdogs of +125 to +150 this season, with the OVER going 6-2 in that situation.
Marlins starting pitcher Tom Koehler (3-3, 2.57 ERA) suffered a 6-5 road defeat to the Los Angeles Dodgers last time out, as he surrendered four runs and six hits over 3.2 innings of work. The right-hander is 0-3 with a 5.14 ERA in four efforts away from home—serving up four home runs in 21 combined frames. In two lifetime starts versus the Giants, Koehler has put together a 1-0 record and 3.00 ERA.
San Francisco has gone 6-4 in its last 10 games, with the OVER going 5-4-1 in that span. The Giants have been getting great production out of outfielder Tyler Colvin since being called up from Triple-A Fresno, as he’s 7-for-16 with four runs scored in four starts since last Saturday. It’s important to point out that the franchise is 4-12 in its last 16 home games in this series. Over the last two-plus seasons, the club is 36-25 as home favorites of -125 to -150.
Giants starting pitcher Tim Lincecum (3-2, 4.78 ERA) earned a 4-2 home victory over the Atlanta Braves last time out, as he allowed a single run and two hits over 7.2 innings of work. The right-hander is 1-1 with a 4.64 ERA in four home outings, with opposing hitters batting .271 against him. Lincecum has struck out 40 batters over 34 frames in five lifetime starts versus the Marlins.
Sports bettors will likely back the Giants due their 5-1 record in Lincecum’s last six starts as a home favorite.

..great to see the Collings and Herrin podcast attic…and yes, great to see Twitter being used like this (loved the little dig at the end about spelling mistakes). Ta for this Matt – a really interesting report.TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL)4 is a death ligand expressed on natural killer cells that contributes to immune surveillance against infected and transformed cells (1, 2). TRAIL receptor signaling has also been implicated in suppression of cancer metastasis (3). TRAIL is of interest as an anti-cancer therapeutic, as it can selectively induce apoptosis in cancer cells, leaving normal cells unharmed. Recombinant TRAIL and agonistic antibodies that trigger TRAIL death receptor activity are under clinical evaluation in cancer patients (4). In the human, there are two closely related TRAIL death receptors: TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2, also called DR4 and DR5, that are broadly expressed and are often present on the same cells (5). Death receptors have a cytoplasmic death domain that enables them to induce apoptosis. Upon ligand binding, they recruit and activate inducer caspase-8 and/or 10, which enables apoptotic execution (6, 7). Death receptors can also transduce anti-apoptotic signals, primarily via the NF-κB pathway (8). The subcellular localization of the receptor may determine the nature of the signal, because in certain tumor cells, death receptors TNF-R1 and CD95 activated NF-κB from the cell surface, but caspase-8 from endosomes (9, 10). TRAIL receptors, however, activated caspase-8 from the cell surface (11, 12). Therefore, the amount of TRAIL receptor at the cell surface may determine the strength of the apoptotic response to physiological TRAIL or TRAIL-R targeting therapeutics.
Generally, cell surface receptors are internalized from the plasma membrane at steady-state, as well as after ligand binding, potentially by distinct mechanisms (13). In the endocytic pathway, receptors are sorted and recycle back to the plasma membrane, or traffic to lysosomes for degradation (13). Ubiquitination is an important principle in regulating endocytosis and lysosomal transport of membrane receptors (14). Modification with monoubiquitin or K63-linked polyubiquitin directs receptor sorting by enabling interaction of the receptor with proteins that regulate endosomal trafficking (14).
A recently discovered group of ubiquitin ligases that targets membrane molecules is the MARCH family. These mammalian membrane-associated RING-CH ligases have been identified on the basis of their homology to ligases of murine and human herpesviruses (15–17). The MARCH proteins have an amino-terminal cytoplasmic ligase domain, with characteristically spaced cysteine and histidine residues (C4HC3) (18–20). This typical E2-binding RING finger domain is generally followed by two transmembrane segments and a cytoplasmic carboxyl-terminal region (18–20).
The different MARCH family members reside in different compartments within the cell (18–20). The closely related MARCH-1 and MARCH-8 are located on endosomes and the plasma membrane and are both implicated in regulating cell surface expression of their substrates (15, 16, 21–23). MARCH-1 is the only family member for which genetically deficient mice have been studied. This work has established that endogenous MARCH-1 regulates antigen presentation and T-cell costimulatory functions of dendritic cells by attenuating cell surface expression of its substrates MHC class II and CD86 (22, 24, 25). Although MARCH-1 is mainly expressed in cells of the immune system, expression of MARCH-8 is broader (15, 16). For MARCH-8 and a number of its relatives, ubiquitination substrates have been reported, but these were all identified by exogenous MARCH (over)expression, except for MARCH-1 (18–20). The functions of endogenous MARCH ligases are therefore largely unknown.
Here, we identify TRAIL-R1 as a substrate for ubiquitination by endogenous MARCH-8 in breast cancer cells. TRAIL-R1 was targeted with preference over TRAIL-R2 for down-regulation from the cell surface by various exogenously expressed MARCH ligases. In this way, the MARCH ligases attenuated apoptosis signaling in response to TRAIL. We identified a unique membrane-proximal lysine in the cytoplasmic tail of TRAIL-R1 that is important for its ubiquitination, its interaction with MARCH-1 and -8, and its down-regulation by these ligases. RNA interference identified MARCH-8 as the endogenous ligase that ubiquitinates TRAIL-R1 and attenuates its steady-state cell surface expression. These findings identify MARCH-8 as a regulator of TRAIL-R1 signaling and a potential determinant for tumor cell sensitivity to TRAIL receptor-targeted therapy.
MCF-7Casp-3 breast cancer cells (26), Mel Juso melanoma cells, and retrovirus packaging cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM). H358 lung cancer cells were cultured in Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium (RPMI). Both media were supplemented with 8% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. MG132 was from Calbiochem and bafilomycin A1 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Soluble recombinant human IZ-TRAIL was kindly provided by Dr. Henning Walczak (Division of Medicine, Imperial College London, United Kingdom). Transferrin (Sigma) was conjugated to FITC by a standard procedure and FITC-transferrin was purified by Sephadex G-25 gel filtration. Mouse monoclonal antibodies used were: biotin-conjugated anti-human TRAIL-R1 mAb DJR1 and anti-human TRAIL-R2 mAb DJR2–4 (eBioscience); HRP-conjugated anti-HA mAb clone HA-7 (Sigma) and HRP-conjugated anti-FLAG mAb M2 (Sigma); anti-Dynamin-1 mAb 41 (BD Biosciences) and anti-Actin MAB1501R (Millipore). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies used were: anti-TRAIL-R1 AB16955 (Millipore), anti-mRFP and anti-GFP (made in house) (27) and anti-active Caspase-3 (BD Biosciences). Allophycocyanine-conjugated streptavidin was from BD Biosciences and HRP-conjugated swine anti-rabbit Ig was from DAKO A/S. Secondary polyclonal antibodies conjugated with Alexa Fluor 568 and Alexa Fluor 647 were from Molecular Probes. Goat anti-rabbit IgG or goat anti-mouse IgG, conjugated with IRDye 682 or -800 were from LI-COR (Lincoln NE).
The TRAIL-R1.mRFP fusion was created by PCR/restriction enzyme-based cloning of TRAIL-R1 cDNA from pcDNA3-TRAIL-R1 (kindly provided by Dr. H. Walczak) into pmRFP-N1 (28), resulting in carboxyl-terminal mRFP tagging of the type I TRAIL receptor. Point and truncation mutants of TRAIL-R1.mRFP were generated by PCR-based mutagenesis. The TRAIL-R1.mRFP cDNA was subcloned from pmRFP-N1 into the retroviral vector pMXIRESBlasticidin to allow for stable expression by gene transduction in MCF-7Casp-3 cells. Plasmids pUHD10–1-MARCH-1, pUHD10–1-MARCH-2, pUHD10–1-MARCH-8 (kindly provided by Dr. Klaus Früh, Vaccine and Gene Therapy Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, Beaverton OR), and pOTB7-MARCH-4 and pOTB7-MARCH-9 (Geneservice) served as PCR templates for MARCH cDNAs, which were cloned into pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) to create MARCH.GFP fusions. MARCH-1.HA and MARCH-8.HA cDNA was generated by subcloning MARCH cDNAs into pHAN1, which is peGFPN1 (Clontech) in which the eGFP coding sequence is replaced by a double HA tag with the sequence YPYDVPDYA (kindly provided by L. Janssen, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam). The pcDNA3.1-Dynamin-1 WT and K44A plasmids were derived from the pMT2-Dynamin-1 WT and K44A plasmids (29). Plasmid pcDNA3.1 encoding FLAG-tagged human ubiquitin was a gift from Dr. Simon Cook (Babraham Institute, Cambridge, UK). Point and truncation mutants of TRAIL-R1 and MARCH-8 were generated by PCR-based mutagenesis. The pLKO.1 empty plasmid or plasmids containing shRNA hairpins targeting MARCH-8 (CCTCCTTCTCTCGCACTTCTA, nucleotide 194–214), or MARCH-1 mRNA (1b GAGAAGAACTTCTCATGTAAT, nucleotide 745–765; 1c GTACAGTGTAAAGTCTATGTT, nucleotide 649–669) were purified from bacterial glycerol stocks (Open Biosystems, Thermo Scientific). All vector construction was done using standard cloning and PCR techniques. All constructs were verified by dideoxynucleotide sequencing.
Cells were transfected with FuGENE 6 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). Cells were used for assays at 24 h after transfection. When shRNAs were transfected, cells were used 48–72 h after transfection. Retroviral transduction was done as described (30). In brief, for production of amphotropic retrovirus carrying pMXIRESBlasticidin TRAIL-R1.mRFP WT or -K/A constructs were transfected into the HT1080-derived packaging cell line FLY. MCF-7Casp-3 cells were transduced with freshly harvested virus-containing FLY cell supernatant and cells were selected after 3 days with 10 μg/ml of Blasticidin (Sigma).
For apoptosis induction, cells were stimulated with the indicated concentrations of recombinant soluble TRAIL in culture medium for the indicated periods of time at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Active caspase-3 content was determined by flow cytometry as described (26). Cells were stained with propidium iodide (1 μg/ml) in PBS with BSA for 5 min at room temperature to detect membrane-permeable dead cells. For flow cytometric detection of endogenous TRAIL receptors, cells were harvested in PBS/EDTA followed by staining with biotinylated anti-TRAIL-R1 mAb DJR1 and anti-TRAIL-R2 mAb DJR2–4 (1:250 and 1:500) combined with allophycocyanine-conjugated streptavidin. The mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) obtained upon staining with secondary reagent only was subtracted from the MFI obtained after TRAIL receptor staining to yield the TRAIL receptor MFI expressed in the figures. Samples were gated on live cells. Data were analyzed using FCS Express (De Novo Software, Thornhill, Canada) or FlowJo (Tree Star, Ashland, OR).
Cells were harvested and lysed in Nonidet P-40 buffer consisting of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM PMSF and Complete Protease Inhibitors (Roche). For the experiment depicted in Fig. 4C, cells were lysed in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% SDS, 10 mM DTT, 0.5 mM EDTA, for 10 min at 95 °C. The SDS was quenched by addition of 9 volumes of Nonidet P-40 buffer. Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation for 10 min at 13,000 × g and protein content was measured by Bio-Rad protein assay. Immunoprecipitation was performed with antibody to mRFP, followed by Protein G-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare). Immunoprecipitates were washed, resuspended in reducing NuPAGE sample buffer (with 0.1 M DTT), and heated for 10 min at 95 °C. SDS-PAGE was done on pre-cast 4–12% NuPAGE minigels, according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). Total cell lysate (taken prior to immunoprecipitation) was run at 30 μg of protein per lane, as determined by Bio-Rad protein assay. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes by wet blotting for 90 min at 70 V. Membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 5% (w/v) skim milk (Oxoid) in Tris-buffered saline (TBS). Antibody probing was performed in TBS with 1% (w/v) skim milk and 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20. For detection by ECL (Pierce Biotechnology), blots were incubated with HRP-conjugated anti-HA or anti-FLAG mAb, or with rabbit anti-mRFP followed by HRP-conjugated swine anti-rabbit Ig. Alternatively, blots were incubated with unconjugated primary antibody, followed by IRDye-conjugated second step antibody and proteins were detected on the Odyssey infrared imager (LI-COR). Quantification of signals was done using ImageLab software (Bio-Rad) or Odyssey software (LI-COR), respectively.
RNA was isolated according to the manufacturer's protocol (RNeasy mini kit; QiaGen). Copy-DNA (cDNA) was generated from the RNA using SuperScript II RT (Invitrogen). Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using FAST SYBR Green master mix (Applied Biosystems).
Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 4 for Windows (Graph Pad Software). The tests employed and the criteria for significance are indicated in the figure legends.

To study how cell surface expression of TRAIL receptors is regulated, we blocked receptor internalization in MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells, engineered to stably express caspase-3 (MCF-7Casp-3). These cells have endogenous TRAIL-R1 and -R2 and effectively undergo apoptosis upon TRAIL treatment (26). Receptor internalization was blocked by dominant-negative dynamin-1 (K44A), which inhibits endosome formation (14, 31). K44A dynamin-1 inhibited transferrin uptake (Fig. S1), confirming the inhibitory effect of this mutant on receptor endocytosis.
Interestingly, this experiment revealed a differential impact of K44A dynamin-1 on the steady-state cell surface expression of TRAIL-R1 versus TRAIL-R2. In cells that expressed high levels of dynamin, as revealed by high GFP expression, the K44A mutant specifically up-regulated cell surface expression of TRAIL-R1, whereas it did not affect TRAIL-R2 expression (Fig. 1A). This indicated that, at steady-state, TRAIL-R1 has a higher turnover by dynamin-dependent endocytosis than TRAIL-R2.
Because certain MARCH ligases were previously shown to down-regulate various molecules, including CD95 (15), from the cell surface upon exogenous expression, we hypothesized that MARCH ligases might also regulate TRAIL receptor plasma membrane levels. To test this, we focused on MARCH-1, -2, -4, -8 and -9, because these locate to the plasma membrane and/or endosomal compartments and were already implicated in modulation of cell surface expression of several molecules (18–20). The MARCH proteins were transiently expressed as GFP-chimeras in MCF-7Casp-3 cells and their impact on endogenous TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2 cell surface levels was determined by flow cytometry. Several MARCH proteins reduced the cell surface level of TRAIL-R1, as revealed by reduced TRAIL-R1 fluorescence intensity of MARCH-transfected cells compared with control vector (GFP)-transfected cells (Fig. 1B). Quantification of the results from multiple independent experiments showed that in MCF-7Casp-3 cells, expression of MARCH-1, -8, and -9 significantly reduced TRAIL-R1 cell surface levels (Fig. 1C). TRAIL-R2 cell surface levels, on the other hand, were only slightly affected by the MARCH proteins in MCF-7Casp-3 cells and the down-regulation was not statistically significant (Fig. 1, B and C). In the same cells, CD95 was most prominently down-regulated by MARCH-1 and MARCH-8 (supplemental Fig. S2), confirming published data (15). In Mel JuSo melanoma cells, exogenous expression of the different MARCH proteins also resulted in a more prominent down-regulation of TRAIL-R1 than TRAIL-R2 cell surface expression (Fig. 1D) and similar results were obtained in HeLa cervix carcinoma cells (data not shown). We conclude that MARCH family members preferentially target TRAIL-R1 over TRAIL-R2 and down-regulate its cell surface expression at steady-state..
To evaluate the possible implications of our findings for tumor therapy with TRAIL receptor agonists, we tested whether MARCH ligases altered the sensitivity of MCF-7Casp-3 cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. We focused on MARCH-1 and -8, because they are closely related (20), they are most clearly implicated in the endocytic trafficking of membrane proteins and consistently affected TRAIL-R1 cell surface expression in MCF-7Casp-3 and Mel JuSo cells. The cells were transiently transfected to express GFP-tagged MARCH-1 or MARCH-8, or GFP alone (control) and treated with soluble recombinant TRAIL, at different doses. Apoptosis signaling was read out at 5 h after TRAIL treatment, by flow cytometric detection of cleaved caspase-3 in the GFP-positive (MARCH- or control GFP expressing) cell population. In addition, cell death was read out by staining with propidium iodide at 14 h after TRAIL treatment, followed by flow cytometry. Both MARCH-1 and MARCH-8 expressing cells were significantly less sensitive to TRAIL-induced apoptosis than the control GFP expressing cells (Fig. 3, A and B). Data depicted here were obtained with isoleucine-zippered (IZ) TRAIL (26, 32), but similar results were obtained with FLAG-tagged TRAIL (supplemental Fig. S3). Expression of the MARCH-8 RING mutant did not confer resistance to TRAIL-induced cell death (Fig. 3B). These data indicate that MARCH ligase activity can determine the sensitivity of tumor cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis.
The fact that MARCH ligase activity could regulate TRAIL-R1 cell surface expression, suggested that TRAIL-R1 might be a target for ubiquitination. To examine this, a WT TRAIL-R1.mRFP chimera was expressed in MCF-7Casp-3 cells, together with FLAG-tagged ubiquitin. Upon immunoprecipitation (IP) with anti-mRFP antibody from Nonidet P-40 lysates, a distinct FLAG-reactive smear was revealed in association with WT TRAIL-R1.mRFP, but not with mRFP alone (−) (Fig. 4A, lanes 1 and 2). This suggests that ubiquitin is associated with TRAIL-R1 at steady-state.
Conceptually, the ubiquitin isolated with TRAIL-R1 could be appended to a TRAIL-R1 interacting protein rather than to TRAIL-R1 itself. To test whether ubiquitin was directly linked to the receptor, we expressed a TRAIL-R1 truncation mutant lacking the C-terminal death domain (TRAIL-R1 ΔWT). TRAIL-R1 WT and ΔWT were compared side by side for their migration pattern (Fig. 4B, lanes 2 and 4). TRAIL-R1 ΔWT migrated faster than TRAIL-R1 WT, as expected. Importantly, this was paralleled by a similar change in migration pattern of the co-isolated ubiquitin (Fig. 4B, lanes 6 and 8), indicating that ubiquitin was appended to TRAIL-R1 itself. Furthermore, ubiquitin was still present in TRAIL-R1 isolate obtained from cell lysate that had been denatured by boiling in SDS, prior to immunoprecipitation of TRAIL-R1 (Fig. 4C, lanes 1 and 2). Collectively, these data indicate that TRAIL-R1 itself is a substrate for steady-state ubiquitination by a endogenous machinery. Upon overexpression of MARCH-8, ubiquitination of TRAIL-R1 was increased (Fig. 4A, lanes 2 and 5), suggesting that MARCH-8 ubiquitinates TRAIL-R1.
Next, we aimed to identify the potential ubiquitin acceptor site(s) in TRAIL-R1. The ligase domain of mammalian and viral MARCH proteins approximates its target close to the cytoplasmic face of the membrane (15, 20). TRAIL-R1 has a single membrane-proximal lysine residue (Lys-273) in the cytoplasmic region preceding the death domain (Fig. 4D and supplemental Fig. S5A). Notably, this lysine residue is highly conserved among primates, which like humans, and unlike other species have two TRAIL receptors (supplemental Fig. S5B). To study the possible involvement of Lys-273 in TRAIL-R1 ubiquitination, this amino acid was mutated to an alanine residue and steady-state ubiquitination of the TRAIL-R1 K273A mutant in MCF-7Casp-3 cells was examined. Comparable amounts of WT and K273A mutant TRAIL-R1 were isolated, but less ubiquitin was detected in association with the mutant receptor than with the WT receptor (Fig. 4A, lanes 2 and 3). The total cellular expression levels of TRAIL-R1 WT and K273A and ubiquitin are depicted in supplemental Fig. S4. Similar results were obtained when TRAIL-R1 WT and K273A were isolated from denatured cell lysates (Fig. 4C, lanes 2 and 3). These results indicate that Lys-273 is either the acceptor site of ubiquitin or important for interaction with the responsible ligase.
Upon mutation of Lys-273 in TRAIL-R1, ubiquitination of the receptor was reduced but not completely lost (Fig. 4, A and B). Moreover, upon overexpression of MARCH-8, ubiquitination of both TRAIL-R1 WT and K273A was increased (Fig. 4A). These data indicate that Lys-273 is a potential ubiquitin acceptor site in TRAIL-R1, but not the only one.
It has been shown that viral MARCH family members can target nonlysine residues for ubiquitination, specifically cysteine, threonine, and serine (33, 34). Ubiquitination on cysteine, threonine, and/or serine can also occur by an endogenous mechanism in mammalian cells (35), but the ligase(s) involved have not yet been identified. For these reasons, we examined whether TRAIL-R1 was ubiquitinated on the cysteines or the serine that are present in its membrane-proximal region (Fig. 4D). To simplify acceptor residue identification, we generated a C-terminal truncated receptor, leaving only the 14 most membrane-proximal cytoplasmic amino acids. In this truncated receptor, the lysine, cysteine, or serine residues were mutated, either alone or in combination (Fig. 4D). The TRAIL-R1 mutants lacking the membrane-proximal serine or cysteine residues were still ubiquitinated (Fig. 4E). In the absence of Lys-273, however, all ubiquitination of TRAIL-R1 was lost. Together, these data indicate that TRAIL-R1 is ubiquitinated at steady-state by an endogenous ligase. In TRAIL-R1, Lys-273 but also residues more than 14 amino acids distal from the plasma membrane are potential ubiquitin acceptor sites.).
Immunoblotting for TRAIL-R1 on total cell lysates revealed that total cellular protein levels of WT TRAIL-R1 were reduced by co-expression of MARCH-1 or -8 (Fig. 5A, panels III and IV). In contrast, the total cellular level of the TRAIL-R1 K273A mutant was unaffected by either MARCH protein, suggesting that TRAIL-R1 down-regulation occurred by virtue of its interaction with MARCH-1 or -8. These findings were substantiated by quantification of TRAIL-R1 levels in total cell lysates from multiple independent experiments (Fig. 5B).
Furthermore, we analyzed the impact of MARCH-1 and MARCH-8 on the cell surface expression of TRAIL-R1 WT and its K273A mutant. Flow cytometric analysis showed that the TRAIL-R1 K273A mutant was much less efficiently down-regulated from the cell surface by MARCH-1 or MARCH-8 than the WT TRAIL-R1 (Fig. 5C).
We conclude that TRAIL-R1 can form a complex with MARCH-1 and -8, supported by the Lys-273 residue in the cytoplasmic tail of TRAIL-R1. Moreover, MARCH-1 and -8 down-regulated cell surface expression of WT TRAIL-R1, but not the K273A mutant. Together, these data indicate that Lys-273 is involved in the interaction of TRAIL-R1 with MARCH-1/8, and its down-regulation by these ligases.
Because MARCH-1 and -8 down-regulated endogenous TRAIL-R1 from the cell surface (Fig. 1) and reduced total expression levels of exogenous TRAIL-R1 (Fig. 5), we hypothesized that MARCH-1 and -8 targeted TRAIL-R1 for degradation. To test this, we first studied the mechanism by which endogenous TRAIL-R1 was turned over at steady state. For this purpose, we used H358 lung cancer cells, as they express larger amounts of TRAIL-R1 than MCF-7Casp-3 cells (supplemental Fig. S6). After a 16-h treatment with the translation inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX), endogenous TRAIL-R1 levels were reduced to about 60% of untreated control levels (Fig. 6, A and B). Recoveries of TRAIL-R1 from Nonidet P-40 lysates and lysates prepared with more stringent RIPA buffer were similar, indicating that the receptor did not reside in compartments that were insoluble after Nonidet P-40 lysis (results not shown). Thus, CHX treatment visualized steady-state degradation of endogenous TRAIL-R1. This degradation could be blocked by bafilomycin A1 (BafA1), a lysosomal inhibitor (Fig. 6, A and B). Inhibiting the proteasome with MG132 also partially inhibited TRAIL-R1 degradation. Statistical evaluation of data from three independent experiments indicated that rescue of TRAIL-R1 by BafA1, but not rescue by MG132, was significant (Fig. 6B). This indicates that at steady-state, a large pool of endogenous TRAIL-R1 is targeted for degradation in lysosomes.
Next, we addressed MARCH-8-induced degradation of endogenous TRAIL-R1 in our main model system, MCF-7Casp-3 cells. Cells were transfected to express MARCH-8.GFP or GFP alone, treated with BafA1 for 16 h or left untreated. Endogenous TRAIL-R1 expression was determined in the transfected populations that were isolated by flow cytometric sorting. In cells that did not express MARCH-8, BafA1 treatment increased TRAIL-R1 expression (Fig. 6C). MARCH-8 expression considerably reduced endogenous TRAIL-R1 levels, which was reverted by blocking lysosomal degradation with BafA1 (Fig. 6C). Statistical evaluation of data from three independent experiments indicated that BafA1 treatment rescued MARCH-8-induced degradation of TRAIL-R1 (Fig. 6D). These experiments indicate that MARCH-8 targets endogenous TRAIL-R1 in MCF-7Casp-3 cells for lysosomal degradation at steady state.).
The validated MARCH-8 shRNA was subsequently used to test whether endogenous MARCH-8 was responsible for the ubiquitination of TRAIL-R1. MCF-7Casp-3 cells were transfected to express WT or K273A TRAIL-R1 and FLAG-ubiquitin, together with either a control vector or a MARCH-8 shRNA. Silencing of MARCH-8 reduced the level of WT TRAIL-R1 ubiquitination (Fig. 7C). Interestingly, ubiquitination of TRAIL-R1 K273A was also reduced to some extent upon MARCH-8 silencing (Fig. 7C). Therefore, we conclude that TRAIL-R1 is a substrate for ubiquitination by endogenous MARCH-8 that potentially targets lysine 273, but also one or more additional residues.
We next used MARCH-8 shRNA to test whether endogenous MARCH-8 regulated endogenous TRAIL-R1 cell surface expression. MCF-7Casp-3 cells were transfected with either a control vector or a MARCH-8 targeting shRNA. Subsequently, cell surface expression of TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2 was examined by flow cytometry. Expression of a MARCH-8 shRNA significantly up-regulated TRAIL-R1 cell surface expression, whereas TRAIL-R2 surface expression was unaffected (Fig. 8A). In contrast, expression of two different validated MARCH-1 targeting shRNAs had no effect on either TRAIL-R1 or TRAIL-R2 cell surface expression (supplemental Fig. S7 and Fig. 8A).
The specificity of the RNAi effect was confirmed by using a MARCH-8 rescue (Rs) construct that could escape from shRNA-mediated down-regulation (Fig. 8B). MCF-7Casp-3 cells were transfected to express GFP-tagged MARCH-8 WT or MARCH-8 Rs, in the presence or absence of MARCH-8 shRNA. Both WT and Rs MARCH-8 down-regulated cell surface levels of TRAIL-R1, whereas silencing of MARCH-8 expression with shRNA significantly increased TRAIL-R1 cell surface levels (Fig. 8C). Up-regulation of TRAIL-R1 by MARCH-8 shRNA was overruled by co-expression of the untargeted MARCH-8 Rs (Fig. 8C). These data show that steady-state cell surface levels of endogenous TRAIL-R1 are regulated by endogenous MARCH-8. The collective data indicate that endogenous MARCH-8 ubiquitinates TRAIL-R1 to attenuate its cell surface expression.
We here present TRAIL-R1 as the first physiological substrate of the endogenous MARCH-8 ubiquitin ligase. Hereby, TRAIL-R1 joins MHC class II and CD86 (22, 24), as the only endogenous substrates that are thus far identified for the entire mammalian MARCH family. Moreover, we identify Lys-273 in the cytoplasmic tail of TRAIL-R1 as one of the potential ubiquitin acceptor sites for MARCH-8. For the viral MARCH-related ligases K3 and K5, it has been demonstrated very elegantly that ubiquitin transfer does not rely on the amino acid context of the ubiquitination site, but its distance from the plasma membrane, which was optimal at 15 amino acids for K3 and 10 amino acids for K5 (36). This can easily be understood from the topology of the ligases. In K3 and K5, the amino-terminal RING domain is spaced by 28 amino acids from the first transmembrane segment. This constrains the RING domain in its ability to reach an acceptor site in its target that likewise is fixed in the membrane (37). Interestingly, this spacing is highly conserved in all nine mammalian transmembrane MARCH proteins (analysis by SMART) and strongly suggests that all MARCH proteins ubiquitinate their targets on residues close to the plasma membrane. The ubiquitination sites identified for MARCH-1, -4, -8, and/or -9 in MHC class I, -II and CD86 are indeed membrane-proximal (15, 23, 24).
Lysine 273 of TRAIL-R1 also conforms to this rule, as it is located 11 amino acids from the transmembrane segment. However, MARCH-8 overexpression still increased ubiquitination of TRAIL-R1 K273A (Fig. 4A) and MARCH-8 knockdown reduced ubiquitination of this mutant (Fig. 7C). Therefore, Lys-273 is not the only possible target residue in TRAIL-R1 for MARCH-8. We have ruled out unconventional ubiquitination of membrane-proximal cysteine and serine residues. This leaves more membrane-distal residues as potential ubiquitin acceptor sites. Surprisingly, the first lysine residue after Lys-273 is located 108 residues from the membrane (supplemental Fig. S5A). Interestingly, it was recently described that exogenous MARCH-8 ubiquitinates a IL-1 receptor accessory protein on a lysine located 124 amino acids from the membrane (38).
We found that MARCH-1 and -8 interact with TRAIL-R1 at high stoichiometry, in a detergent-resistant manner. The current literature suggests that interaction between MARCH-type ligases and their substrates primarily depends on the transmembrane regions of the partners. This was reported for the viral ligase K5 (39–40), but also for MARCH-1 (41–43) and MARCH-8 (16, 44). Possibly, Lys-273 directly interacts with MARCH-1 and MARCH-8. Alternatively, Lys-273 may be the ubiquitination site and interaction with the MARCH ligases is stabilized by the ubiquitination event itself.
We found that upon deliberate expression, several MARCH family ligases could attenuate cell surface expression of TRAIL-R1. The ligases preferentially down-regulated TRAIL-R1 and had little impact on TRAIL-R2, as observed in breast carcinoma and melanoma cell lines. MARCH-1 and -8 also down-regulated CD95 in the study by Bartee et al. (15) and we confirmed that out of MARCH-1, -2, -4, -8, and -9, these two ligases had the most profound effect on cell surface expression of CD95 (supplemental Fig. S2). The selectivity of MARCH ligases to down-regulate TRAIL-R1 and CD95 with preference over TRAIL-R2 may reflect availability of ubiquitination sites. However, all three receptors have lysine residues at membrane-proximal locations (supplemental Fig. S5C). We therefore consider that the inefficient targeting of TRAIL-R2 may rather be due to a difference in membrane microdomain localization and/or endosomal trafficking of TRAIL-R2 compared with the other two receptors. We observed that the cell surface levels of TRAIL-R1, but not TRAIL-R2 increased upon transient overexpression of K44A dynamin-1. This may imply that TRAIL-R2 is turned over at the steady-state by a dynamin-independent mechanism, but it may also indicate a difference between the two receptors with regards to the dynamics of this process.
Current knowledge on the mechanism of action of the MARCH ligases indicates that they may down-regulate cell surface expression of TRAIL-R1 by various mechanisms. For the closely related MARCH-1 and MARCH-8, available data argue that they down-regulate cell surface expression of their, partially shared, target proteins by promoting lysosomal degradation. MARCH-1 and -8 can accomplish this in different ways that may depend on the target and cell type. In B cells and dendritic cells, MARCH-1 attenuated cell surface expression of its endogenous substrate MHC class II by promoting its transport toward lysosomes, but not its endocytosis (22, 25). MARCH-8 on the other hand down-regulated cell surface expression of its targets CD86 and MHC class II by promoting their endocytosis from the plasma membrane (16, 23, 45). In the case of recently identified targets CD44 and CD98 (46, 47), MARCH-8 diverted them away from recycling endosomes and into the lysosomal pathway. This process required the TSG101 component of the ESCRT-1 complex, suggesting an impact of MARCH-8 on cargo sorting in multivesicular bodies (47). This is reminiscent of the action of viral K3 (48) and underlines that MARCH-8 can promote lysosomal sorting of membrane proteins at different locations in the endosomal route. In case of TRAIL-R1, MARCH-8 may likewise impact before and/or after endocytosis, but our data indicate that it targets TRAIL-R1 for lysosomal degradation, thereby decreasing cell surface and total protein expression levels.
Proteasomal inhibition also inhibited TRAIL-R1 degradation to some extent (Fig. 6A). Possibly, there is a pool of TRAIL-R1 that is directly degraded by the proteasome. Alternatively, proteasome inhibition might have impacted on TRAIL-R1 degradation in an indirect manner, e.g. by affecting endosomal routing (49, 50) or gene expression (51).
The closely related MARCH-1 and MARCH-8 both interacted with TRAIL-R1 and down-regulated it from the cell surface. However, in MCF-7 cells, only silencing of MARCH-8 and not MARCH-1 had an impact on the cell surface expression of endogenous TRAIL-R1. This may reflect differential expression, because MARCH-1 is primarily found in lymphoid tissues, whereas MARCH-8 is more ubiquitously expressed (15, 20).
In the breast cancer cells we have studied, TRAIL receptors signaled for apoptosis from the cell surface rather than from endosomes (data not shown), in agreement with previous findings in B-lymphoma and cervix carcinoma cells (11, 12). Mechanisms that attenuate TRAIL receptor cell surface expression can therefore be expected to affect TRAIL receptor signaling. In normal physiology, the TRAIL receptors are targeted by membrane bound TRAIL that is expressed by natural killer cells. In experimental cancer therapy, TRAIL receptors are targeted by soluble recombinant TRAIL, but also by receptor-selective agonistic antibodies, to induce tumor-specific cell death (4). This novel function of MARCH-8 may therefore have implications both in a physiological setting, as well as in future cancer therapy.

Despite considerable research effort, self-injurious behavior (SIB) continues to be a primary reason, together with aggression toward others, that individuals are either retained in institutional (restrictive) environments or are administered psychotropic medication. Today, SIB remains unmanageable, expensive ($150,000–$500,000/year/patient in institutional settings, with national costs well over $3,000,000,000 [
Twenty-five experts invited by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) to discuss the relations among the genetic, neurobiological, and behavioral causes and treatments for SIB reached two general conclusions. Intentional acts of harm to self, evident in many species, (a) have no known cause and (b) no agreed upon treatment [
One major obstacle in understanding the mechanisms of SIB and developing coherent treatment plans is the absence of distinctive behavioral phenotypes. Despite the consensus that SIB has variable expression with no known cause, the group of NICHD experts agreed that SIB could be defined, perhaps with greater precision than most complex human behaviors. SIB is a directly observable behavior that can be reliably counted. The NICHD group argued that data collection and analysis had advanced so that complex patterns of SIB should replace or supplement measures of rate and frequency [
Specifically, we found for a large majority of the individuals studied, SIB was predicted only by its own recent history. In our cohort of severely self-injurious patients, SIB was expressed consistently in successive occurrences revealing a unique pattern of sequential dependence compatible with a “contagious” distribution. Application of time-series methods of analysis that controlled for chance pairings of events indicated that the contagious patterns of SIB were independent from frequency and rate of occurrence. That is, the temporally dependent patterns we observed were not a function of high rates of occurrence. Moreover, and surprisingly, SIB was not associated consistently with other behaviors or with the several staff activities or environmental conditions recorded in these studies. Thus, in a significant majority of these individuals, SIB episodes were self-perpetuating and not related to antecedent or subsequent environmental circumstances, events, or other recorded behaviors.
This novel and surprising finding was consistent with conclusions of the NICHD group that some expressions of SIB may have an underlying biological basis because a solely self-perpetuating behavior is most parsimoniously explained by internal (
Because many medications that treat pain or induce pleasure are addicting, it is interesting that SIB, in addition to the obvious involvement of pain systems, shares features of addiction such as compulsive and ritualistic (or stereotypic) patterns that either comprise or surround the self-injuring acts. One biological system that has been implicated in SIB and the modulation of pain and pleasure is the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) stress axis and specifically the proopiomelanocortin (POMC) molecule [
Thompson and Caruso [
Although it is not a universal observation, most self-injurious individuals do not exhibit the usual signs of pain after their “injurious” behavior. Despite inflicting serious physical damage to their bodies, many of these individuals do not grimace, cry, or show other symptoms that they are experiencing pain. It has been suggested that this absence of response to self-inflicted injury reflects insensitivity to pain and general sensory depression induced either by elevated endogenous opiates or by supersensitive opiate receptors [
It also is possible that the addictive properties of elevated endogenous opiates are responsible for maintaining SIB. If it is presumed SIB does result in pain and that the experience of pain results in the release of opiates, then it can be argued that individuals commit self-inflicted harm to receive the euphoric (pleasurable) effects of increased circulating opiates. From this perspective, SIB is an “addiction” to the endogenous opiate system because its consequences supply a “fix.” It has been known for over 25 years that endogenous opiates have addictive properties as indicated by the development of tolerance [
The endogenous opioid system is tightly coupled with the general stress response. Evidence from several laboratories indicates that functioning and processing of a stress-related molecule (POMC) in the HPA axis may be perturbed among subgroups of individuals exhibiting SIB [
In a review of pre-1991 studies [
More recently, a thorough review of the scientific literature employing stringent and appropriate criteria for inclusion concluded that the effects of opiate blockers on SIB could be evaluated in a total of 86 patients [
Two relatively large, placebo-controlled studies [
Another double-blind, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose study of eight, severe to profoundly retarded adults included in the review [
These two relatively large studies of
In the single study that has evaluated the effects of naltrexone using time-series analysis, Symons
The long-term effects and consequences of continued treatment with naltrexone is not completely known because most studies reporting treatment of individuals with SIB have been short-term demonstrations or acute trials. Most published long-term studies have been either case studies or open-label designs and they have generated mixed results. Two types of studies comprise the long-term evaluations of naltrexone, either prolonged treatment with naltrexone or extended observations following brief periods of treatment. With these procedures, investigators have reported that about six of eight patients examined in several studies exhibited long-term benefits in varying degrees from treatment with naltrexone [
We [
The primary finding from our study was that a subgroup of patients exhibited persisting effects (decreased SIB) in the 12 months after acute treatment with naltrexone. Seven patients exhibited decreased SIB over the 12-month period and five of these had a 75% reduction in SIB compared to the placebo control period. These five patients, each with at least a 75% reduction in SIB, increased their SIB when administered naltrexone in the long-term treatment protocol. The largest decrease in SIB was observed in patients who had a brief exposure to naltrexone, were given a 12-month hiatus during which they showed an increase in SIB, and then were readministered naltrexone several times in the 18-month double-blind, placebo-controlled study.
In our initial study to examine the relation between circulating endogenous opioids and response to naltrexone, we collected blood samples from ten patients within 2–5 min of a self-injuring act and during a control period [
In a follow-up study of nine additional patients (total of nineteen), we [
Positive responses to low doses of naltrexone were observed in subjects
These findings have since been extended using a fundamentally different method for quantifying changes in the temporal patterning of SIB following treatment with naltrexone. The THEME method developed by Magnusson [
We have made similar observations in our long-term studies of naltrexone and SIB [
When it was established that the body had its own opiate system [
The observations that opiate blockers reduce SIB are important for at least two reasons. First, naltrexone produces a clinically significant reduction in a serious and life-threatening behavior for some individuals typically who have not been responsive to any other type of treatment. We have observed startling improvements in individuals who have failed all rational treatments. Some adults in our studies have had protective headgear discontinued for the first time since early childhood. Others have developed adaptive skills and have acquired the ability (or the privilege) to leave institutions for the first time in their lives after treatment with naltrexone. Second, the results with naltrexone are important because they suggest that a
From the current review we can draw several conclusions. There is consensus in the literature that doses between 1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg or a fixed dose of 100 mg are the most effective for reducing SIB [

Commissioner Bruno A. Barreiro returns parking spaces to residents near Marlins Park
(Miami-Dade County, FL) -- In an effort to alleviate parking concerns for residents living on NW 3rd Street between NW 14th Avenue and NW 16th Avenue near the newly-constructed Marlins Park, Commissioner Bruno A. Barreiro presented a resolution to restripe the street strictly for residential parking. The item was passed unanimously at the April 3rd Miami-Dade Commission meeting.
Commissioner Barreiro has been working closely on this issue with City of Miami Commissioner Frank Carollo to find a solution for residents who lost their on-street parking on NW 3rd Street as a result of the new stadium.
“I urge the Miami Marlins to cover the cost to restripe the street and return parking spaces back to the residents. However, should an agreement not be reached, I commit to utilizing my District 5 PTP funds to assist in reinstating their parking spaces,” said Commissioner Barreiro.
For more information, please contact Commissioner Barreiro’s office at 305-643-8525.View Usher and Tameka's photo diary »

The Raymond household got an early Christmas present as Usher and Tameka welcomed their new baby, Naviyd Ely Raymond, around 2:33 A.M. on Wednesday. The baby weighs in at 5 pounds and 13 ounces, according to Usher's rep Simone Smalls of Simone Smalls Public Relations. In September, the Grammy-winning singer and celebrity stylist confirmed they were expecting a second son together following the birth of Usher Raymond V in November 2007.
"Tameka and the baby are doing fine," said Smalls in a written statement.
Usher exclusively introduced his namesake to the world on the cover of ESSENCE in August and shared how fatherhood gave his life new meaning and joy. "When your child looks at you, there's nothing phony," he said. "There's nothing fake about it. It's pure love."
In September 2007, the couple married in a private Atlanta ceremony among family and friends while Tameka was five months pregnant. This makes the second child for Usher and fifth for Tameka, CEO of Swanky Image Group and Hides and Dungarees Denim Collection.
Usher wrapped his One Night Stand tour in support of his fifth album, "Here I Stand," in November and continues to work on his upcoming lingerie collection, a follow-up to his UR fragrance line. The ATL pop phenom is also co-owner of Atlanta wine bar The Grape as well as the NBA's Cleveland Cavaliers. He also works closely with his foundation, Usher's New Look, which empowers youth in inner-city communities.Let's Dance songs, Let's Dance Mp3 Songs, Let's Dance download free music, mp3 hindi music, download Let's Dance bollywood, indian mp3 rips, Let's Dance 320kbps, download cd rip, 128kbps mp3 download, Let's Dance mp3, flac release of Let's Dance, mp3 music of Let's Dance, hindi songs download of Let's Dance, download latest bollywood songs, listen Let's Dance hindi mp3 music, Let's Dance, let dance, lat dance, let dannce, Gayatri Patel, Maser Aabhaas, Paras Arora, Aquib Afzal, Ajai Chowdhary, Nikunj Pandey, Anjan Srivastava, Sugandha Garg, Asif Basra, Abhaas Yadav, Aarif Shaikh, Vipin Mishra, Tarali Sharma

- Game 25: Habs/Ducks
Just a quick note in advance of tonight’s game in Anaheim against the not-so-mighty Ducks. Anaheim cannot keep the puck out of their net this year. Hiller has struggled as have his defense. It is critical that Montreal get on the forecheck early in this game so the Ducks can’t build any momentum. I’m excited to see Leblanc in a Habs jersey. The word is that Markov will not play this evening.
Go Habs Go!

At a dinner this week in San Francisco, I found myself seated between Matt Golden, co-founder of energy efficiency retrofitter Recurve — the startup formerly known as Sustainable Spaces — and Cisco DeVries, co-founder of Renewable Funding, the Oakland outfit that pioneered municipal financing of residential solar arrays.
The hot topic was Home Star — aka Cash for Caulkers — the proposed $6 billion federal energy efficiency rebate program now wending its way through Congress. The bill is being cast as a way to fight climate change, lower energy bills for 3.3 million homes and create an estimated 168,000 sustainable green jobs in a recession-wracked nation.
No surprise that a coalition of environmentalists, labor groups, and businesses have hitched their star to Home Star, including Home Depot, Dow Chemical, the Sierra Club, and the Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute.
About $3.6 billion of Home Star cash would be devoted to “Silver Star,” a program designed to quickly roll out basic energy efficiency improvements by providing up to $3,000 in rebates per household for such things as insulation and sealing doors and windows.
The Gold Star part of the program offers $3,000 for every 20 percent in energy savings that result from retrofits, up to a maximum of $8,000. Under Gold Star, homeowners could undertake more extensive energy efficiency retrofits as well as install renewable energy systems such as solar arrays.
Both programs would cap the rebates at 50 percent of a project’s cost.
“This program is designed to rapidly create jobs but also a long-term American industry,” Golden said a couple days after the dinner during a press conference held in advance of Congressional hearings Thursday. “We have an opportunity to contribute to energy independence and meet our climate goals. The construction industry is in the realm of a Depression. These are 100 percent American jobs.”
It’s winning rhetoric but what I wanted to know was this: with billions of dollars in federal subsidies potentially flooding the energy efficiency market, how do you ensure that retrofits are done properly and that the climate change dividend gets paid?
Talk to old-timers who lived through various solar subsidy programs back in the 1970s and ’80s and they’ll bemoan the shoddy operators that tried to cash in on the market, giving legitimate companies a bad name.
Golden takes pains to emphasize that Home Star energy efficiency retrofits will be audited to ensure “the American taxpayer is getting their money’s worth.”
The details of those audits remain to be worked out but some high-tech tools could help make sure those caulking guns shoot straight.
Over the past year there’s been a proliferation of home energy management software from companies like Google and Microsoft as well as startups such as AlertMe and Tendril.
New Microsoft Hohm software provides real time data on home energy useThe idea behind services like Microsoft’s Hohm and Google’s PowerMeter is to give homeowners data — in real time for those whose utilities have hooked up smart meters — on their energy use. That way they can pinpoint where they may be wasting electrons, whether through bad habits or electricity-hogging appliances, and adjust their behavior accordingly.
I asked Microsoft executive Troy Batterberry whether Hohm could play a role in Home Star to monitor electricity usage before and after a retrofit and quantify the energy savings from various improvements.
“Absolutely and it’s a question we get from our utility partners,” said Batterberry, who runs the Hohm program. “We’re going to have mountains of data that we can use to verify, say, what the expected savings will be when a person puts in a new high efficiency heat pump or air conditioner.”
“Home Star could ignite the use of this type of tool,” he added.
Such programs could also come in handy in helping retrofit firms identify energy hogs in a home.
Dan Reicher, director of climate change and energy program’s for Google.org — the search giant’s philanthropic arm — discovered that feature of the company’s PowerMeter energy management software when he began using it at his home.
“Literally with PowerMeter, everyone discovers something about their home they didn’t know about,” Reicher told me during a recent visit to Google’s Silicon Valley headquarters. “In my case I had an old gas furnace but decided that given we don’t have a lot of cold weather around here it didn’t make a lot of sense for me to replace it. What I didn’t realize was that the furnace had an ancient electric motor.”
Once Reicher started using PowerMeter he began to notice spikes in his home’s electricity usage every time the furnace came on. After some investigation he discovered the culprit was the old inefficient motor that pushed hot air through the house’s ductwork.
Such data could help make those Home Star dollars go even further by providing at least a partial roadmap of a home’s energy efficiency weak spots before the guys and gals with the caulking guns show up at the front door. And assure taxpayers that their dollars are well spent.

Add to my calendarKALAMAZOO, MI — Kalamazoo County Road Commissioner Kent McCauley will not seek a second term, county Board of Commissioners Chairman David Maturen said Tuesday.
McCauley was up for reappointment but declined a second term because he was taking an out-of-state job, Maturen said.
McCauley, of Vicksburg, was first appointed to a six-year term to the road commission in 2007 and was elected chairman in 2010 and 2011.
The seats of McCauley and Daniel Moyle, another road commissioner, are up for appointment by the county board.
Commissioners considered waiving a required interview of Moyle for reappointment, but decided against it. Instead, they will interview candidates for both road commission seats, likely during the county board's last meeting of the year on Dec. 18.
Applications will be available on the county website or by calling the county administrator's office at 269-384-8111. Maturen said he hopes all applications will be submitted by the end of November.
UPDATE, Nov. 21: McCauley said he is taking a job in North Dakota as a store manager for Caterpillar.
"I'd like to thank the county board for their support of what we do," McCauley said. "They've been a very supportive board, I've enjoyed my time, I've learned a lot."

Greenwald, 66, had intended to stay at the company for one more year but opted to step aside and give Borshell a chance to pull the company out of its financial funk. “He’s certainly very capable of pulling this off,” Greenwald said. “He got the job because he earned it.” Borshell, who started at the company in 1984 as a part-time shipping clerk when he was a college student at Cal State Northridge, said he had made no secret of his desire to take the reins but always knew that moment wouldn’t come until Greenwald was ready to step down. “I’m grateful to Marty and the board for giving me the opportunity because too often boards go outside for new leadership,” Borshell said. Borshell has been handling much of the acquisitions and day-to-day responsibilities in recent years as Greenwald tended to shareholder concerns and navigated various acquisition bids. Although the company has moved into digital distribution in recent years, its main focus remains DVD. “Our first priority is profitability,” Borshell said. “We’ll be looking at all areas to maximize our profitability.” Image, which generates about $100 million in annual revenue, reported a $2.05 million loss in its third fiscal quarter ended Dec. 31. The company, which started as a laserdisc distributor, revolves around a quirky catalog with a heavy concentration in music and comedy videos, some of which the company produces. It has distributed the Criterion Collection of upscale special editions for a few years and has been trying to get into the feature film game. For now, the company is off the market, although Borshell acknowledges that its distribution apparatus could attract future takeover bids. Greenwald said he felt sad to be stepping back from the company he helped build but acknowledged that the ownership battles of the past few years have taken their toll on him. He said the takeover bids were very distracting and hindered the company’s ability to snag more distribution deals in a challenging marketplace. “If they’re going to buy the company, buy the company,” Greenwald said. “For me, it’s been nine rounds of body punches.” Greenwald said he plans to remain active in outside real estate ventures — he’s developing a shopping mall in Las Vegas and another development on the East Coast — and feature film projects. “I’ve had all the fun in the world,” Greenwald said. “Now I think I can be a more effect chairman and he can be a more effective leader.”CHARLESTON, S.
According to the indictments, the defendants were in the United States illegally, and traveled from South Carolina and surrounding areas to New Mexico to apply for New Mexico driver's licenses. The indictments set out that New Mexico, unlike South Carolina, does not require proof of U.S. citizenship to obtain a driver's license. It further sets out that the defendants obtained false proof of New Mexico residency, such as utility bills, and provided them to the New Mexico Motor Vehicle Department when applying for driver's licenses in New Mexico. Those defendants would then return to the South Carolina area, and co-defendants living in New Mexico would later mail them the fraudulently applied for and obtained New Mexico driver's licenses.

Pleasant, S.C.
A third indictment charges: Bulmaro Perez-Perez, age 35, of Doraville, Ga.; Darco Jordan-Tapia, age 32 and Marisol Pantoja-Loredo, age 23, both of Charleston, S.C.; Roberto Trejo-Lopez, age 22 and Arturo Trejo-Lopez, age 18, both of Chantilly, Va.; Ruben Trejo-Lopez, age 24, of Centreville, Va.; Jesus Octaviano-Leyva, age 40, of Charlotte, N.C.; Gabriel Sotelo, age 42, of North Charleston, S.C.; and Jose Luis Hernandez-Delgado, age 28, of Knoxville, Tenn.
The indictments allege conspiracy to transfer false identification documents and to transport illegal aliens; producing and transferring false identification documents; and, transporting illegal aliens. Conspiracy to transfer, and to produce, false identity documents, as well as the transfer and production of those documents, each carry a maximum sentence of 15 years imprisonment. Conspiracy to transport illegal aliens, as well as transporting illegal aliens, both carry a maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment.

d . “Zoologists originally thought that the paired fins of coelacanths and the fossil lobe-fins functioned as true limbs, as props to lever the fish against the solid substrate of the bottom sand or against rocks.” Keith S. Thomson, Living Fossil: The Story of the Coelacanth (New York: W. W. Norton & Co., Ltd., 1991), p. 160.
u “... much attention has been focused on their fins in the hope that they will tell more about how fins became limbs.” Ommanney, p. 74.
u “For the coelacanth was a member of a very ancient class of fishes which was supposed to have disappeared some 70 million years ago. This great group of fishes, called crossopterygians, flourished during that decisive era in the history of the earth—when the fish, taking on legs and lungs, went forth to conquer the continents.” Jacques Millot, “The Coelacanth,” Scientific American, Vol. 193, December 1955, p. 34.
As late as 1955, Dr. Jacques Millot, who led many studies of freshly caught coelacanths, still believed coelacanths evolved legs.
Perhaps their stalked fins permit them to creep along the rocks like seals. Ibid., p. 38.
This myth was buried only after Dr. Hans Fricke’s team observed coelacanths in their natural habitat in 1987. Their bottom fins have nothing to do with legs or creeping. Why did Millot ignore facts he knew best? The coelacanth, he thought, solved a big problem. In 1955, Millot wrote:. Ibid., pp. 35–36.
Later (1987), after studying live coelacanths, the scientific world learned that Millot was wrong. The coelacanth did not bridge this gap. Therefore, the fish-to-amphibian problem is back.
u “He [J. L. B. Smith] was able to report [in the journal Nature] that, like the lungfishes, the fish had an air bladder or lung (on the basis of the taxidermist’s report of the discarded viscera), which was a median rather than paired structure.” Thomson, Living Fossil, p. 39. [It is now recognized that the discarded “bag” was not a lung, but an oil-filled swimming bladder.]
e . “The brain of a 90-pound coelacanth weighs less than 50 grains [0.11 ounces]—that is, no more than one 15,000th of the body weight. No present-day vertebrate that we know of has so small a brain in relation to its size.” Millot, p. 39.
f . “I confess I’m sorry we never saw a coelacanth walk on its fins.” Hans Fricke, “Coelacanths: The Fish That Time Forgot,” National Geographic, Vol. 173, June 1988, p. 838.
“... we never saw any of them walk, and it appears the fish is unable to do so.” Ibid., p. 837.
g . “Few creatures have endured such an immense span of time with so little change as coelacanths. The cutaway drawing of a present-day specimen seems almost identical with the 140-million-year-old fossil found in a quarry in southern West Germany. ... Why have coelacanths remained virtually unchanged for eons ... 30 million generations?” Fricke, p. 833. [Answer: They were fossilized a few thousand years ago, during the flood.]
u “Throughout the hundreds of millions of years the coelacanths have kept the same form and structure. Here is one of the great mysteries of evolution—that of the unequal plasticity of living things.” Millot, p. 37.
u “The coelacanths have changed very little since their first known appearance in the Upper Devonian.” A. Smith Woodward, as quoted by Thomson, Living Fossil, p. 70.
u “What is even more remarkable is that in spite of drastic changes in the world environment, the coelacanths are still much the same organically as their ancestors. ... In the meantime, research is continuing ... and will try to penetrate the secret of the adaptability which has enabled them to live through many geological eras under widely differing conditions without modifying their constitution.” Millot, p. 39.

Moving from BG80 Power to BG66 Ultimax
As mentioned above,
just recently got my rackets restrung from BG80 Power (25 lbs) to BG66 Ultimax (25lbs),
the BG66 Ultimax feels like metal although it's strung at 25lbs (has the same feel as 28lbs for other strings),
hmmm still not quite able to handle/control it yet,
do you guys feel the same?

Many (many) years ago (gulp), I used to use BG65. As I had my own stringing machine then, I tried out BG66 which was relatively new then. I found it very difficult to play with.
Fast forward to latter years, I find BG66 quite good to play with and string it at a higher tension than the first time I tried it.
The difference could be a change in the string's material over time.
But I believe the major difference is my technique over time. The first time I used BG 66 my technique was really quite poor. Can still play matches and competitions but using too much strength and had not learnt to use much finger technique. After getting some formal coaching and a lot of technique practice, I found BG66 a great string to use.
Whilst I haven't used BG66UM, my experience may give people something to ponder upon.

Dr. Smagorinky's culminating book, "Vygotsky and Literacy Research: A Methodological Framework", was chosen by the committee because in it Dr. Smagorinsky helps move his readers beyond the ZPD in relation to Vygotsky's theories to important issues that many of us are thinking and talking about now. He highlights the role of "emotion" (the affective aspect that is often left behind in our discussion about learning as well as other ideas Vygotsky explored.)
The committee has chosen him for this book and for his lifetime contributions as a researcher in English Education. His ability to translate research and theory into support for teachers is a very important contribution toShare it!

Australian consulting firm Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation (SMEC) has signed a $4 million contract for the reconstruction of Iraq's electricity grid.
SMEC had an existing contract with the United Nations for upgrading substations in three northern provinces in the Kurdish areas of Iraq before the war under the "oil for food" program.
At the end of the program last month, existing contracts were transferred to Iraq's Coalition Provisional Authority.
Eight SMEC engineers will continue to upgrade substations.
"The CPA has agreed to provide an umbrella but the details haven't been sorted out yet and if there's any security risk we'll be pull our people out," Greg Sturgess of SMEC said.
"There's been no direct encouragement from CPA but water and electricity is a high priority and we hope that the work they see us do will lead to more."
SMEC hopes the contract will lead to more work in reconstructing Iraq.
Last week Australia was included in a list of 44 countries that would be eligible to bid for contracts in Iraq.
Rebuilding Iraq's power grid is one of the key objectives of the US-led administration in the country.-  Center for Cyber Security covered in Times-Dispatch

Hello!
I recently bought an EC-1000 (VB) in like-new condition. The action was set up really low and there was a lot of fret buzz. I decided to set it a little bit higher to get rid of the buzz and so that it would be still easy to play.
I adjusted truss rod, bridge and everything...like 4 times already. Still can't get rid of the buzz. All strings except the high E buzz all over the fretboard...pretty much on all frets (first fret is fine though, doesn't buzz as much as the rest of the fretboard).
I use Ernie Ball .10 - .46.
I want to fix this myself, so, any advice will be greatly appreciated. :)
Andrew
Even though you want to do the repair yourself, the best thing to do would be to take it to a decent luthier and get a professional opinion. They might even just tell you how to fix it and send you off wihout charging anything. That's a pretty hefty issue though, so you may want to get it looked at asap if you only have a certain amount of time to return it.
It could be a number of things, best advice is to take it to someone who knows what they are doing, playing around with the truss rod is a recipe for disaster, it's a nice guitar, it's worth the cost of a decent setup
Dead frets. I had this problem with an old EC i used to have. Just keep adjusting the bridge is what i did. in the end the action on the guitar ended up so perfect that....... to this day i haven't played a guitar with better action (lol). that's not really saying much because i haven't played a wide veraity of guitars. Why mess with the truss rod? that seems like an awful idea. you could warp your neck messing around with that. It's not that difficult of a proble to fix think of it as if it had a floyd rose. You wouldn't be messing with the truss rod if your floyd was uneven with the body youd screw in the springs that are on the back or unscrew... well what i'm trying to say is don't mess with the truss rod that's not the problem. I think your problem is your bridge mess around with it.... buy lots of strings.
Well, yea, I'm not gonna mess with the truss rod anymore, even though I didn't do anything stupid (all I did was 1/10 or 1/8 turn just to see if it helps at all).
I'll try messing with the bridge. Should I try raising it up a bit first?
Thanks guys.
Andrew
Andrew, I have the same issue with my Ec-1000. I always set up my own guitars, but this one has puzzled me. No matter how straight the neck is or how much relief it has, the buzzing is there. The only way I can get rid of (most of) it is to set the bridge pretty high, 2.4 mm bass, 1.8 mm treble. I checked my frets and they are all level, plus the nut is fine. I hate the guitar, but it's what I have, so I have to play it. Do like me and set it up to where it's most tolerable. Mine seems to play better with a pretty straight neck, around .0006" relief, measured with automotive feeler gauges. Of course, I have to set the bridge higher as I mentioned, but it plays best that way. Good luck.
Dear, I think if the action of the strings are too low then you just raise up the bridge to make it higher and adjust the truss rod to make the neck straight, tune the string to be in tone, then your guitar might work better! :)
Bro I think you may have one of two problems or maybe both. It sounds like someone tried to lower the action my sanding down the nut instead of the bridge. Not a problem but very easy to over due. And if it is overdone, that requires a new nut. Yes you can raise it but it would honestly be cheaper and more efficient just to buy and put in a new one. Another problem could be your frets weren't dressed properly. Doubtful but can happen. If that's the case, you have to dress and relevel all the frets. Either way you need to take it to a shop. Find a good local guy that proves he knows what he's doing. Don't just get his word. And have him/her check it out for cheap.
Jumbo frets. play it!!!
Mine buzzes as well. just jumbo frets on them. a good thing. kinda.. goes away after awhile
What tuning are you in, and also what level of "guitar master" are you when it comes to setting up....
After lowering the bridge and tightening the truss rod a little bit, for some reason it doesn't buzz as much as it did before. And it doesn't bother me anymore. It plays great. I still use .10-.46 and play in standard tunung most of the time.
Anyways, thank you for your help. I'll take my guitar to a luthier as soon as I get a chance.
you shouldnt mess with the truss rod. tightening it may cause serious damage. like i said earlier. the buss is probably from the jumbo frets. also buzz can be caused from a bend in the strings if you didn't open the packaging properly and unwound it damaging it. i have buzz on mine. you should definetly take it in now and have a luther adjust it properly..
Even though i like to tinker with my own stuff, anything i buy new or used goes to a tech first for me. I mean when you buy underwear you dont wear em straight out the bag right? lol you wash em first.
.....You mean they arent broken in for me? CURSE YOU HANES!!!!!
No seriously tho, if your buzzxing is still giving me trouble I can walk you through a "RESET" for your guitar that might be a fix. Let me know, and treat your trussrod like you would walk through a sleeping grizzly den with a steak strapped to ya...TREAD SOFTLY.
The reality is you don't need to take to a luthier to make neck adjustments, or set-up action and intonation, and I just have to shake my head everytime I see people saying that you do.
If you really want to know how to do these easy basic adjustments properly, buy an instructional book/video for $25 instead of paying someone $100 twice a year. Here, I'll even help you out with a link to a site that literally provides a lot of info for free, and even sells instructional books/videos and all the tools as well.

MONTRÉAL, April 30, 2014 /CNW/ - Today Montréal welcomed approximately 750 new Canadian citizens from 81 countries during three ceremonies downtown.
Ceremonies like these demonstrate how the government is working to make the citizenship program more efficient, helping more people realize sooner their dream
- Since 2006, Canada has enjoyed the highest sustained levels of immigration in Canadian history-an average of a quarter million newcomers each year. Accordingly, the demand for citizenship has increased by 30 percent.
- For a new Canadian, the citizenship ceremony marks their formal entry into the Canadian family. A citizenship ceremony is a unique part of Canadian civic life. It is one of the few occasions where we formally reflect on the rights, responsibilities, privileges and benefits of being a Canadian citizen.
- Almost 17,000 new citizens have been welcomed at 90 ceremonies in Montréal so far in 2014..- Filed Under
Six weeks before the birth of their first child in 2008, Scott Mihalick and Wendi Zimmerman of Raritan Borough thought their biggest dilemma was in which cute outfit they would dress their newborn baby for the first trip home.
Instead, they were deciding between cardiologists, surgeons and children's hospitals. At what was supposed to be a routine ultrasound, they were told there were abnormalities with their unborn child's heart.
"We were told she had a congenital heart defect," Zimmerman said. "Our whole world changed. But we were very lucky that it could be fixed." ...Event: Envy: The Cutthroat Side of Science
Moderator: Mariette DiChristina; Panelists: Harold Garner, Ivan Oransky, and Morton Meyers
Date: April 31, 2013
Organizer/Source: New York Academy of Sciences
Like many of the Academy’s Science and the City events, “Envy” presented a panel of speakers. Ultimately it showed the strengths and weaknesses typical of panels. The panel’s main strength was its range of expertise. Its corresponding weakness, a lack of focus, would scarcely bear mentioning, except that this particular panel was split between two perspectives that neither clashed nor harmonized. This split brought to mind the proverbial donkey that stands midway between a trough of water and a bale of hay. The poor beast fails to move towards either because it is just as thirsty as it is hungry.
The first perspective, scientific misconduct as an expression of individual character, was covered by Dr. Morton Meyers, Distinguished University Professor and emeritus chair of the Department of Radiology in the School of Medicine SUNY, Stony Brook. Actually, Meyers did not dwell on the most obvious forms of misconduct such as plagiarism and outright fakery. For the most part, he told stories of acrimonious priority disputes.
Although attendees were probably aware that many scientists are capable of being as selfish as they are ambitious, Meyers provided historical details of considerable intrinsic interest. For example, Meyers explained how the discovery of streptomycin involved a dispute between Schatz and Waksman. Also, he explained how the development of magnetic resonance imaging involved a dispute between Damadian and Lauterber. (These and other controversies are discussed in Meyers’ book, Prize Fight: The Race and Rivalry to be the First in Science.)
Meyers’ co-panelists were less interested in historical drama than in timely metrics. Dr. Harold Garner, Director of Medical Informatics Systems at the Virginia Bioinformatics Institute, described how database applications are being used to detect instances of plagiarism. Dr. Ivan Oransky, a blogger at Retraction Watch (and Executive Editor of Reuters Health at Thomson Reuters), discussed the increasing number of retracted articles. By some estimates, more than two-thirds of retractions are due to misconduct, not simple error.
To their credit, Garner and Oransky avoided sensationalism, perhaps because they feel that the available data are just beginning to characterize scientific misconduct. In any event, these panelists called for incremental improvements, not sweeping reforms.
Garner suggested that post-publication searches could be augmented by preemptive searches. If a preemptive search were conducted as part of the review of a grant application, a granting agency might detect an attempt at “double dipping,” the solicitation of funds for a project that has already been funded by another granting agency.
Oransky insisted that retraction notices should be clearer. At present, vague notices frustrate attempts to understand the nature of retractions. (Clearer notices might suggest ways to prevent the publication of retraction-worthy papers.)
The circumspection observed by the panelists contrasted with the willingness of the attendees to offer their speculations during the Q&A. Some attendees boldly suggested that the scientific enterprise itself, not just individual scientists or research projects, might be compromised. They raised questions about the role of commercial incentives and political pressures. The panelists, however, seemed unimpressed. Garner expressed confidence that worthless products, ineffective drugs, say, would fail to win patent approval. He concluded, “Products must work.” (For an alternative point of view, see this article.) Similarly, in response to a question about whether political interests could pressure researchers, Oransky said, “It is not so easy to gin up slanted research to support your agenda.”
Perhaps other issues, such as the desirability of more stable funding, could have been taken up, but time was too short, particularly since most of the Q&A time was consumed by just one attendee. Many attendees of Science and the City Events are well informed, though perhaps no so well informed as they imagine. (It seems that they would happily replace any speaker, given the chance.) They must pose a challenge to moderators!

Virginia Rometty will take over for Sam Palmisano effective Jan. 1. Now women run both HP and IBM.
IBM on Tuesday made its CEO succession plan official: Virginia Rometty will take over for Sam Palmisano effective Jan. 1.'s.
As noted last month, the IBM hand-off appeared to be near..
Palmisano became CEO in 2002 and took over as chairman in 2003. During Palmisano's tenure, IBM ditched the PC and printer units and focused on emerging markets, software, services and analytics. IBM also made a lot of dough--$100 billion in free cash flow.

The co-founder of a charity founded after the deadly Sandy Hook shootings has made a shocking discovery.
"A charity formed for victims of Sandy Hook Elementary School says the group is missing $70,000." (Via KSTP)
According to Sky News, one of the co-founders of the 26.4.26 Foundation, Ryan Graney, says only about $30,000 of the $103,000 collected during a marathon had been used.
That $30,000 was reportedly presented last year by another co-founder, Robbie Bruce, to the nonprofit NYA, a youth sports center in Newtown, Conn. (Via KDFW)
Although there's no hard evidence, according to WBZ-TV, Graney has a theory about where it might be.
"The co-founder believes her partner who handled the finances took the rest and has not been heard from since."
WVIT reports that partner is reportedly an endurance athlete whose whereabouts are currently unknown by his fellow partners and the press.
The 26.4.26 Foundation was founded in Nashville to raise money for those involved in the tragic shooting at Sandy Hook on Dec. 14, 2012 that claimed the lives of 20 children and six teachers. (Via Facebook / 26.4.26)
But after news of the missing money broke, the charity announced it has permanently stopped fundraising efforts via a post on its Facebook page.
Graney says she notified the FBI and the Tennessee attorney general's office about the missing funds in September after Bruce was unable to explain where it went. Bruce has not responded to calls from several media outlets.Who’s Bombing Her Now?
By Bruce Anderson
Anderson Valley Advertiser
Most AVA readers are probably aware, however dimly, that a woman named Judi Bari was nearly killed in Oakland by a car bomb in May of 1990. The device detonated directly beneath the driver’s seat of the car
Bari was driving.
The person with her, Darryl Cherney, her close friend and fellow Earth First! organizer, was only slightly injured. Both Bari and Cherney would have been killed if the bomb had exploded as designed. A resident of Mendocino County and self-identified Earth First!er, Bari had been foremost in organizing Redwood Summer, a mass protest against corporate timber’s cash-in of the Northcoast’s redwood forests.
The spectacular attempt on Bari’s life was soon eclipsed by the first Iraq war, and Bari, grievously injured in the explosion, died in 1997.
The FBI and the Oakland Police had prematurely arrested Bari and Cherney on the presumption they had knowingly transported the device that almost killed.
Within days of the blast, Mike Geniella, a reporter with the New York Times-owned Santa Rosa Press Democrat, had received a letter from a person signing himself The Lord’s Avenger. Written in thunderous, faux Old Testament prose, the Avenger described the bomb in detail only the bomber could know. The bombing suspect now became a deranged fundamentalist, and the FBI, always a dependable villain among the left, became the Avenger’s enabler if not co-conspirator.
Bari, Cherney, and their allies well-placed in the Pacifica Network, including Amy Goodman at Democracy Now, have always managed to ignore inconvenient questions about the bombing, especially those raised in a fine but mostly unseen documentary on the case by Steve Talbot, who went on to anchor PBS’s Frontline series.
Talbot’s film was called “Who Bombed Judi Bari?” Talbot answered that question on information supplied by Bari herself — Judi Bari was probably bombed by her ex-husband. Talbot, without directly identifying Bari’s ex in the film, pointed straight at him.
But after Bari’s death, Talbot appeared on a San Francisco-based television program called “This Week In Northern California” to say that Bari had told him she was certain her ex-husband had bombed her, that the great assassins of the corporate-FBI nexus so beloved by the Pacifica Network had to be moved aside for what was really a fancy case of domestic violence.
Bari’s ex-husband, Mike Sweeney, magically kept off stage all these years as the likeliest suspect, is not the usual estranged husband. He comes with special qualifications. He belonged to Professor H. Bruce Franklin’s Maoist posse at Stanford in the late 1960s, and he and Bari met at a labor organizing event, married and moved to Santa Rosa where a hangar on the mostly abandoned airfield next door mysteriously blew up one night prior to their relocation to Redwood Valley in Mendocino County. The airfield was home to weekend pilots who annoyed the Sweeney-Bari household with their overflights, and Sweeney and Bari had successfully sued Hewlett-Packard to halt development of the tract the airfield rested on.
Police suspected Sweeney and Bari — they had no other suspects — but were unable to make the case against them. By the time they arrived in Mendocino County where their marriage soon disintegrated, the two radicals had enjoyed, you might say, a uniquely explosive relationship.
In the 22 years since Judi Bari was blown up in Oakland, out there in what’s left of the American left, it’s an article of faith that she was a martyr to the usual malign forces that do the dirty work for our ruling circles. Tune in Democracy Now or KPFA out of Berkeley and you will hear someone saying that the author of the attack on Judi Bari remains a mystery but we, wink-wink, we in the know, we know the corporations and the FBI got her.
What you won’t hear, because alternative explanations of the case are deliberately excluded from Pacifica’s preciously PC airwaves, is that the mystery of who bombed Judi Bari isn’t a mystery at all, that.
Judi Bari is still being bombed by persons deliberately obstructing resolution of the case, this time in the form of an hagiographic epic assembled by Cherney that mostly features himself. It is also called, “Who Bombed Judi Bari?”, a nice piece of cynicism that might make it appear that the honest film of the same title by Steve Talbot didn’t pre-date Cherney’s film by twenty-one years. Predictably, Cherney’s version of “Who Bombed Judi Bari?” has gotten big play from Amy Goodman and the cringing speakers-of-truth-to-power at places like KPFA.?

We welcome this case being reopened and the DNA evidence tested. It has never been solved or fully resolved.
We also welcome dissenting opinions.
Should Mr. Cherney, Mr. Sweeney, Ms. Goodman, Mr. Talbot, Ms. Kolata, or any accurate historian with a direct and knowledgeable command of the facts like to respond or rebut to the above, the Humboldt Sentinel gladly looks forward to hearing it.
This article is courtesy of Bruce Anderson and appeared in the Anderson Valley Advertiser today, January 3, 2013.
(Images by the Humboldt Sentinel. Posted by Skippy Massey)
Well, I’m glad the Humboldt Sentinel “welcomes” us to respond to its Cointelpro special edition by Bruce Anderson, self-proclaimed aider, abettor, and apologist for the FBI. The fact is that Bruce Anderson has not attempted to see the movie nor interview the people he accuses of a never-ending litany of wrongdoings. Of course, I would be reluctant to be interviewed because Bruce has a long, sordid history of making up interviews and/or statements within interviews–even altering letters to the editor! So how can one be sure one’s interview or even letter be printed accurately by the man known by many as the “Bully of Booneville.” Bruce is a well-established, deliberate liar discernible to all with but a cursory glance.
The history and corrections needed are so sordid and lengthy, that Bruce counts on the reader glazing over at any rebuttal. In 1990 Bruce told the FBI that he thought one of his staff writers, Mike Koepf, was the bomber. In the mid nineteen nineties, he wrote a long piece about how Irv Sutley, the primary source for his faux-theory, was an agent and a suspect. In fact, Sutley family DNA appears on both a death threat and a police informant letter, though Bruce lies in another article and states the DNA belongs to Judi’s ex-husband. He wrote and article about Ms. Bari 3 weeks after she was bombed entitled: ‘Traction Sex” in which he fantasized having relations with Ms. Bari immediately following the bombing. This is not a stable, honest or consistent man we’re talking about here. After literally hundreds of thousands of words written by Bruce on the subject in his paper for the last 18 years, it is literally (and literally literally) impossible to keep up with Bruce’s ever shifting sands of prevarication.
So let’s take a ride down Bruce’s Fantasy Lane on the Badjacket Express and talk about Bruce’s lies in this here hit piece #1038. I might have missed some of these 1000 to 3000 word missives, but this is Bruce’s cottage industry. Let’s investigate how this qualifies as “Independent Media” as opposed to being a well-place Counter-intelligence piece of disinformation. Some of the untruths are from plain ignorance; others are blatant lies, conjured by Bruce to satisfy his inner demons of his pathological lying compulsion that has haunted him, according to his brother, since he was a boy. To quote Bruce’s dad: “You know it’s funny, but Bruce would rather lie than tell the truth.”
Oh, and let me, in advance provide Bruce’s response to all of this: Either: 1) I’m just a liar, with no evidence presented or even a list of the lies or 2) Bruce will invent new lies to keep the “conversation going. It’s rare that I respond to this charlatan, so read on if you really the accurate side of the story. And trust me, the truth is not found by averaging out both “sides, “ if one is a complete fabrication. Bruce is here to muddy the issue, cover the tracks of the bomber for the government agency he loves to defend—the FBI, and to sell papers.
Remember, Bruce constantly laments that there is no left, no real left, no honest debate. Never forget he is talking about himself. Forgive typos and grammatical errors. I don’t have the time for this, really. But nevertheless, here we go:
Non-truth #1: “Both Bari and Cherney would have been killed if the bomb had exploded as designed.”
Truth: The bomb did, in fact, explode as designed. Three videotaped, simulated tests by the FBI proved this. If Bruce had watched the movie or attended a single day of the trial, he would know this. Not the most important correction, but I’m taking them in order.
Non-truth #2: “The FBI and the Oakland Police had prematurely arrested Bari and Cherney on the presumption they had knowingly transported the device that almost killed them.”
Truth: The authorities arrested us deliberately in attempt to silence us, a violation of freedom of speech–there was nothing “premature” about it. They showed up within 5 to 20 minutes and proclaimed us guilty. This was proven in a court of law after an exhaustive trial in 2002 that took 12 years of research and motions to bring to court. Bruce’s selection of the word “premature” implies that we should/could have been rightfully arrested later.
Non-truths #3 &.”
Truth: The lawsuit did everything within it’s legal civic trial power to solve the bombing case, and it did, in fact, turn up Bruce’s BFF Irv Sutley as having family DNA on two key pieces of evidence. DNA we got from the stamp and envelope on the letter taking credit for the bombing was that of an unknown female–certainly not the ex-husband. An unusable trace amount of DNA on the letter was male, attributed to the postman or reporter who received it. No one walked away with a million dollars. Four million dollars divided after 40% attorneys fees (after 12 years), income taxes, Judi splitting her money three ways (2 daughters and a non-profit), comes out to net just over half a million for myself, less for all the lawyers, and Judi’s $1.8 million (gross) shared. No one became a millionaire or even close.
Non-truth #5: “…the FBI, always a dependable villain among the left…”
Truth: Bruce continues his apologies and excuses for the FBI, knowing full well that the FBI actually really is a “dependable villain among the left.” His sarcastic and caustic use of this phrase is disingenuous, as the FBI’s long history of going after labor unions, civil rights leaders, anti-war protestors, environmentalists, etc. is not only well documented, but pretty much its raison-d’être… and a damned good reason to look at the role the FBI played in the bombing of Judi and myself. Facilitating such incidents is what they do and have done for nearly 100 years of documented history (see Congressional Record).
Non-truth #6: “Talbot appeared on a San Francisco-based television program called “This Week In Northern California” to say that Bari had told him she was certain her ex-husband had bombed her…”
Truth: I have this clip and Talbot says no such thing. In fact, Judi did consider her husband to be a suspect and then, before 1990 was over and after much research/investigation, determined he was not. She was never “certain” about anyone. However, Talbot’s documentary determined the most likely suspect was the source of this disinformation campaign in the first place: Irv Sutley, who clearly helped write a police informant letter (DNA and typewriter evidence) that came with a photo of Judi with Sutley’s Uzi (taken presumably as a joke album cover) that only Sutley, myself (Sutley sent me three photos) and his landlady (Judi’s close friend) had access to. Sutley admitted rummaging through the photos and sending one (a photo of Judi with Sutley’s Uzi) to Bruce Anderson, who published it.
Sutley is a 4 decade-long Peace and Freedom Party member and well documented disrupter (narked on two party members and had them convicted of using an out of district address), gun enthusiast, 8=year Marine veteran in the 60′s who never went to Viet Nam, a physical abuser of at least one woman according to the Press Democrat (a Peace and Freedom Party Candidate), writer of many menacing letters, a known police informant, a candidate for Sheriff, a Communist Party member, and a guy in his 60′s with no known street address for longer than a few months. The latter tidbit is particularly interesting as Sutley runs for office regularly and one is required to provide a street address to run. Sutley got an “exemption” because he claimed, as the Sonoma County elections office told me, he feared the “Troskyites” were out to kill him. He achieved national prominence for legally challenging and removing the star and angels off the Sonoma County Courthouse Christmas tree in 2010, becoming Fox News’ and the New York Times’ face of “The War Against Christmas.” This is one of Bruce’s primary sources of information.
Untruth #7: “He belonged to Professor H. Bruce Franklin’s Maoist posse at Stanford in the late 1960s.”
Truth: Please provide evidence of this, not that it matters.
Untruth #8:”[Sweeney] and Bari met at a labor organizing event, married and moved to Santa Rosa where a hangar on the mostly abandoned airfield next door mysteriously blew up one night… The airfield was home to weekend pilots who annoyed the Sweeney-Bari household with their overflights… Police suspected Sweeney and Bari — they had no other suspects.”
Truth #9: Police never questioned Bari or Sweeney about the airport arson, strange if they were the “only suspects.” But more importantly, this illogical accusation goes to the heart of Bruce’s accusation: because Mike Sweeney, Judi’s ex, is an alleged suspect in an act of sabotage in defense of his neighborhood (albeit pretty radical sabotage in the form of arson), he is therefore both technically and mentally capable of murder. Well by that logic, anyone who ever wired his or her own home or got in a fist fight (like Bruce has more than once–understandably–with the subjects of his vitriolic writing) could be a suspect. The fact is that Judi’s ex didn’t have the opportunity to put the bomb in the car given the nature of its timing devise. The theory that the timer malfunctioned for 48 hours is not likely. And even if Sweeney had bombed Judi Bari, one has to go through the giant leap of logic that he has the entire FBI and Oakland Police force at his back to arrest his victim on site. Bruce has explained this by stating that Sweeney was an FBI informant–thereby going completely counter to his own meanderings. If Sweeney worked for or with the FBI then the FBI was behind the bombing. Further, Sweeney didn’t have a motive, at least not to the degree the timber industry did with Judi Bari unionizing and organizing against it en masse. Sutley and Anderson would have us believe that Judi was trying to kill her ex by hiring Sutley through a third party as a hit man and so therefore Sweeney tried to kill her first, as opposed to turning her into the cops. Judi did joke once about killing her ex, which she readily admitted. Further, if there is any evidence on anyone in this case, I urge people to take it to a law enforcement agency with jurisdiction–they are the ones to handle dangerous people and illegal matters, presumably.
Non-truth #10: “….
Truth: Well it was yours truly who organized and ascertained that DNA Bruce claims we are not interested in. And the FBI and Oakland Police were completely disinterested. We, however are very interested. We are currently in a suit with the FBI to test one of the two bombs (yes, the bomber made two) and the first bomb, which partially detonated at an L-P sawmill, contains about 8 feet of duct tape which could contain hair samples, skin flakes, fingerprints, etc. Bruce has publicly come out against such testing, stating that we don’t need to do it to find out who the bomber is, as he states above. So Bruce doesn’t want to test the bomber’s DNA on the bomb itself. That speaks volumes.
Untruth #11: It [our movie] is also called, “Who Bombed Judi Bari?” a nice piece of cynicism that might make it appear that the honest film of the same title by Steve Talbot didn’t pre-date Cherney’s film by twenty-one years.
Truth: Who Bombed Judi Bari? Is a song I wrote in July 1990 that predated Talbot’s documentary for PBS by almost a year. Talbot used the name of my copyrighted song, which I sang in his piece, for the title of his doc. I own that title and gave an audio CD I produced of Judi’s speeches in 1997 the same name. In other words, the first person to come up with that name and most importantly, to ask that question loudly, is me.
Untruth #12: ?”
Truth: I have sent out hundreds of press releases to the left media and gotten less response than from the mainstream media by a lot. I’d suggest that Bruce call the left press and ask them this question. Judi’s famous sister, Gina Kolata, didn’t write about it for the NY Times because she is a science writer and wouldn’t be allowed to write about a family matter if she wanted to. Again, he should ask her. Further, Kolata is a right wing apologist for Dow Chemical and many toxic corporations and didn’t speak to Judi for years. As far as Faludi’s book not being finished, that is a question I’ve asked Susan many times and in turn gotten many poor responses. As for the “family,” where should a family turn for answers? Her parents are dead, she didn’t along with her sisters, and even so, how would this proclaiming be made. Bruce, in classic paranoid conspiratorial fashion implies the whole family is in on it, along with author Faludi, myself, the entire legal team, etc. And what does any of this have to do with hard evidence?
Conclusion
We have a pretty good idea of who Bombed Judi Bari? It was a plan engineered by L-P and the FBI made while they were blowing up cars at bomb school in Eureka 30 days before the bombing on an L-P clearcut. The L-P sawmill was bombed 2 weeks after that and two weeks after that Judi’s car was bombed on May 24, 1990. The head of the FBI’s SF division was a long time Hoover Cointelpro political operative, Richard W. Held. The bomber, probably a low-level snitch/asset—no one we know–the typical M.O. for the FBI. One doesn’t need to twist oneself into an ugly pretzel, as Bruce has done ad nauseum, to see where the evidence leads.
I have one question for Bruce Anderson: if we find DNA on the bomb that is not Mike Sweeney’s and further find out who the actual bomber is, would you, Bruce, plan any restitution to the near two decades of accusations against Sweeney? An apology? Giving up your “writing” career? Because after 18 years of false stories and accusations, and with the genuine possibility we might still learn the truth with the latest round of DNA testing, Mr. Anderson should begin thinking about eating that huge serving of crow he’s been cooking up for himself.
Thanks Bruce Anderson for your efforts .Darryl and judy should have never got one red cent for there dreamed up fantasy .The whole thing was turned around and used for propaganda by the environmental extremists. Who only care about there agenda over the truth .
One doesn’t have to be a particularly close reader to see that Cherney, as always, simply vilifies persons who don’t buy the nonsense he’s parlayed into a handsome living for himself going on 23 years now. He. Also please note that Cherney fails to mention Steve Talbot’s appearance on This Week In California where Talbot stated that Bari told him she was certain her ex-husband had bombed. These people have raised thousands of dollars, won a federal lawsuit worth several million more all on their promise to do something for the environment. The money went to Cherney, Bari’s two already wealthy daughters and a few so-called “movement” lawyers. I’m grateful to the Sentinel for reprinting my story on this ongoing swindle.
“One doesn’t have to be a particularly close reader to see that Anderson, as always, simply vilifies persons who don’t buy the nonsense he’s parlayed into a handsome living for himself going for decades now.”
… See all you have to do is switch the name of the person Anderson is trashing with Bruce’s name and it fits for Bruce perfectly.
Fact is, as I predicted, that Bruce didn’t and can’t refute any of the lies I busted him on. And Bruce is the King of Vilifiers, so go figure.
And as I also corrected predicted, he layers the thoughtful rebuttal to him with more lies. And yes, Bruce knows he is lying, just like we proved the FBI was lying and not mistaken. Here are some new whoppers.
“He [Cherney].”
Actually, we did try to test the bomb fragments and the FBI and te court shut it down after we got results from the first round. They refused to hand anything else over. Why now, Bruce well knows since I’ve written about it extensively: We are demanding it now because the FBI and OPD agreed to turn over evidence to us once they were done with it. In 2010 the FBI announced to us they would destroy the evidence (and not give it to us). So we took ‘em to court and won the right to have it tested. And why did they agree? Because we took less money than we were awarded in exchange for getting the right to eventually test the evidence. It’s amazing how Bruce can take completely logical series’s of events–like a bomb victim wants to know who bombed him and his partner–and turn it into a decades long series of attacks on the victims. Oh, I thought that was supposed to be the FBI who did that? Well, Bruce, answer this: do you remain in contact with the FBI? Do they pay you do to this or are you just a cheap date?
New Lie #2 “Also please note that Cherney fails to mention Steve Talbot’s appearance on This Week In California where Talbot stated that Bari told him she was certain her ex-husband had bombed her.”
Truth: I did address it, but Bruce obviously was reading a bit too fast or maybe he just wanted to see how much he could lie, even in the face of the truth being right there–kinda like the FBI does. Talbot said no such thing and Judi said no such thing to him, but I have the video if anyone wants to see it. I was at the meetings with Talbot and Judi Bari and Judi did want her husband looked at, which makes this whole story of a coverup that much more inane. But as I said, she found he didn’t have the opportunity to have done it.
Lie .”
Truth: Bruce doesn’t engage in honest debate so even though he calls my remarks highly debatable, he doesn’t debate them. That’s because I am speaking the truth and Bruce is lying. And in classic Bruce form, he calls my carefully laid our response “unhinged.” I’m looking for the unhinged part, but the only hinge I see missing the the one that connects Bruce to reality. I never called a bookstore nor do I know anyone who has and asked them to withdraw invitations. But that is perfectly with the right of any American to do. And what did happen at many of Bruce’s appearances is that protests occurred–which Bruce prefers not to mention. People protested his Cointelpro activities, as well they should. But I had nothing to do with them and suggested that others just ignore the Bully of Booneville.
By the way, we’re showing the movie in Booneville on Sat. March 16. I wonder if Bruce will actually attend the movie he constantly criticizes but has never seen. Hint: He’s not getting in for free.
It’s fun to see Cherney on the defensive here. I really appreciate Bruce Andersons’ courage standing up to these eco-terrorists.
I annotated Cherney’s hysterical, in both senses, response on the ava’s website at theava.com I won’t wear out Sentinel readers with a lot of back and forth with this hustler, the gist of which is, and would be, that he and a small group of crooks continue to live off false versions of the Bari bombing and have always blocked or attempted to block honest investigations. They’ll all be in Boonville in March, as will I.
Thank you for this article. When the bombing happened, all the evidence was there. My then-boyfriend and I said to each other…”ex-husband did it”… and our far left friends screamed “NNOOO! Its the MAN trying to keep the truth from the people…” etc. The problem with the entire thing is that these were small time jerks wanting to get on the ‘A’ list of domestic trouble makers. ie: weather underground, PLO, type wanna-be’s. As for Cherney, he has nothing to offer the world, his “cause”, his community, but weird paranoia and BS. I couldn’t read more than a sentence or two of his response, simply because, ‘I think he doth protest too much’. The more he prattles on, the more I think he was a part of the plan, Murder-suicide for the cause, man. Hmmmmm?
Thank you, everyone, and to Mr. Cherney and Mr. Anderson for kindly offering their time and responding with their fair and complete viewpoints for the record, which we and readers appreciate.
There’s more than two sides to every issue; there’s usually multiple sides. We like hearing all of them for the sake of consideration and discussion. The Sentinel’s Mission Statement is simply “Independent Media By and For the People of Humboldt County.”
Readers may decide the issue for themselves given that both sides have weighed in and responded thoroughly.
We’d also like to say that this has also been one of the most thought-provoking and lively discussion threads that we’ve had in quite some time, too.
As another victim of Darryl Cherney’s public lying to attack others he considers enemies to his cause (himself) I suggest Darryl take a lie detector test in front of his critics on his role in the bombing and his knowledge of who did it. I want to see what a lie detector test shows even knowing they are not fully accurate and can be beat and are not admissible in court. Still, I want to see Darryl take one as this issue has gone on long enough that it needs to be cleared. People making money off of tragedy is not a good thing.
I don’t drop a ton of comments, however i did a few searching and wound up here Who Really Bombed Judi Bari? | Humboldt Sentinel. And I do have 2 questions for you if you don’t mind.
And, if you are writing on other social sites, I would like to keep up with everything new you have to post.

Monteverdi: Vespro della Beata Vergine
Naive Records
2005
While not proper seasonal fare, Claudio Monteverdi’s (1567 – 1643) The Vespers of the Blessed Virgin, 1610 nevertheless deserve a Christmas consideration. Vespro della Beata Vergine (in the proper Lat.
Okay, that is the encyclopedia explaination. The true history of Monteverdi's Vespers is a mess. Monteverdi published his Vespers in 1610, dedicated to Pope Paul V (for perspective, the next Pope Paul would not show up for another 328 years, replacing John XXIII). It was not the composer's piousness that drove him to compose what at the time was the largest work of its kind. Monteverdi wanted an appointment as masetro de cappella in Rome. In fact, Monteverdi was not known for his religious music. for twenty-eight years he was most noted as a composer of opera and madrigals, many of the latter more erotic than the church would approve of. After working himself to death as first a vocalist and then conductor at the court of Vincenzo I of Gonzaga in Mantua, Monteverdi wanted to move onto bigger and better things. As it turned out, not only did Monteverdi not get the post, he failed to even get an audience with the Pope. Failing to achieve his temporal goals, Monteverdi created one of the most celebrated pieces of music in Western Musical Culture.
Monteverdi’s Vespers of 1610 represents an integration of Renaissance and Baroque musical styles, although these contrasting styles cannot exactly be viewed as a bridge between the two periods. However, it will suffice for our discussion to consider the Vespers as such a bridge. The Vespers were originally published in combination with a six-voice mass that based on "In illo tempore loquante Jesu," a motet by the Franco-Flemish composer Nicolas Gombert. Outside of composing Vespers as a potential way out of Mantua, Monteverdi’s creative context was poorly understood. It has opined by noted musicologist Graham Dixon that the Vespers setting was perhaps written for the feast of Santa Barbara (Third Century martyr, feast day – December 4), reasoning that Monteverdi’s use of passages from the Song of Songs could apply to any female saint. Monteverdi very well may have intended the application of Vespers to be broad so to have a broad, and therefore more marketable product.
Further evidence of this is revealed in the fact that Monteverdi did not specify the plainchant antiphons to insert before each psalm and the concluding Magnificat as was common practice at the time. This allows the performers to tailor the music according to the available instrumental forces and the occasion of the performance. That is user-friendly composing. Vespers contains reflective moments within its large frame, while incorporating secular elements into the pieces decidedly religious composition. The Vespers present an assembly of musical forms - sonata, motet, hymn, and psalm – while never falling off track. The Vespers maintains a spiritual center by constructing each movement on the traditional Gregorian plainchant for each text, Monteverdi’s intellectual idée fixe or leitmotif and).

Antimony is a rare metallic mineral element commonly used in batteries, low-friction metals, type metal and cable sheathing, among other products. The element is consistently at or near the top of the British Geological Survey’s Risk List, which ranks elements with industrial uses by their difficulty to find, procure and produce.
On Monday, Tri-Star placed 1.27 billion new shares on the market to raise the capital needed for the antimony roaster. The mass of new offerings pushed Tri-Star shares down 7.4 percent to 0.125 pence.
On top of issuing new shares, Tri-Star has conditionally agreed to issue £2 million of secured convertible bonds due in 2018 to Odey European Inc., which already provides the company with a loan note facility.
"I am delighted to be able to announce this important fundraising by Tri-Star, which will enable the company to finance its 40 percent equity share in the Oman Antimony Roaster joint venture," Tri-Star Managing Director Emin Eyi said. "The company will continue to work with its joint venture partners to bring this exciting project through construction and into production to become one of the first sizeable Western World antimony roasters designed to be fully compliant with modern environmental legislation."
The actions will have to be approved by shareholders at the company's general meeting to be held on August 5.Saturday, 18 January 2014

After all the glowing praise Billu (formerly known as Billu Barber) had been receiving from our trusty blog colleagues, Filmi Girl and Beth, we're a little disappointed to be coming to you as the Grumpy PPCC. Because here's the truth: we squirmed through Billu. We checked our watch. We waited for it to end.
The main problem, we reckon, is that Billu comes at the wrong time: during a veritable glut of films which tackle the exact same themes. Things like the mesmerizing, paper-thin world of our Bollywood dreams, the insanity of Shah Rukh Khan's fame, and the nobility of the common man have been tackled, with more subtlety and wit, in other films. For example, Om Shanti Om and Luck by Chance already addressed the mystique of Shah Rukh Khan and Hindi commercial films - the former via worshipful parody, the latter via a cynical satire. And the last properly masala film we watched - the early Anil Kapoor vehicle, Saaheb - told the same moral ("ordinariness is great!") in a more meaningful, touching way. In Billu, after the usual 2.5 hours, an ordinary nice guy was embarrassed and then, finally, acknowledged. The end.
Nice, simple Billu (Irrfan Khan) and his wife (Lara Dutta).
Nice, glamorous Sahir Khan (Shah Rukh Khan) and his co-star (Deepika Padukone).
Based on the friendship between Krishna and the humble Sudama, the story transposes things to a modern-day setting: Krishna is now the Bollywood superstar and SRK parody, Sahir Khan (Shah Rukh Khan), while Sudama is the humble village barber, Billu (Irrfan Khan). Although Billu has a gorgeous wife (Lara Dutta) and two cheeky little kids, he's got nothing but tension: his barbershop is losing business to the place across the street, the town big man (Om Puri) hassles him, his amateur poet friend (Rajpal Yadav) won't stop reciting his half-baked poems to him, the electricity just got cut and the kids are going to be thrown out of school if the fees don't get paid.
Next thing he knows, Sahir Khan and his
The story is straightforward, with few surprises. For this reason, it felt protracted and thin to us, with overly blunt symbolism. We know how it's going to end - the tagline pretty much gives it away - and so it's only a question of going through the motions. No great philosophical insight is given into why Billu's ordinariness should be preferable to Sahir Khan's glamour: both Billu and Sahir are pretty much regular, decent guys. The film seems to be saying that common kindness goes a long way, longer than celebrity, and it shouldn't be overlooked. But then - Billu's not the saintly, mini-bodhisattva that was the title character of Saaheb, another film which glorified the mundane (to much greater effect). He's just... nice.
Filmi Girl made some very interesting notes about the nature of icons and fame, but this isn't the film first this year to show us the vulnerability of unmasked celebrity. Luck by Chance, which we prefer to Billu, addressed the same issues via the scenes where superstar Zafar Khan (another meta-performance, this time by Hrithik Roshan) laments his status as an "image" and via the small, humane details of his day-to-day reality (his scene mugging to the children from his car window).
Thin plot, thin themes and next, thin characterizations. Alas, everyone just seemed one-dimensional to us: we started yearning for the complexity of Rishi Kapoor's aging, vulnerable producer from Luck by Chance, Romy "VOLCANO of talent! (write that down!)" Rolly. The acting was everything expected from everyone involved. Irrfan Khan was dependably believable, though, if we really wanted to emphasize Billu's noble loser-ness, Ranvir Shorey would have been more fun - hello, Mohan the chaiwallah! Shah Rukh Khan was playing, yet again, a parody of himself and, alas, we only felt feeble sparks of the SRK magic during those gargantuan songs. Is the spell broken? (Nahiiiin!) Lara Dutta and Om Puri are two actors that we find ever-lovable, but Lara didn't have much to do and Om Puri was misused (poor Om).
And even director Priyadarshan's cinematography was often a direct copy from Virasat! I swear, that's the same village! And that shot of the long line of carts on the curved path with the mountains in the distance?! Hello, end of the Sun Mausa Sun Mausi song!
So after all this disappointment, can we find anything positive to say? Yes! The songs were pretty grand, and the self-indulgent spectacle was a welcome respite from all that monotonous trudging through the "does Billu know Sahir really really?" village dialogues. Also, interestingly (because of the Krishna-Sudana undertones), all the songs referenced God directly - while the most spectacular song's refrain was "mar jaani mar jaani" (which our subtitles translated as, "they can go to hell!").
Edited, after a chocolate: Okay, here's another good thing: while Priyadarshan may have recycled some shots and the setting, he did have a lot of fun in some scenes - especially during the Sahir Khan sequences. That rock concert was a hoot, and there's am impressive long take of Shah Rukh Khan struggling to contain his pain when a local amateur actor massacres his single line of dialogue. Long takes are always notable, and it was fun to see how Priyadarshan films SRK's reactions rather than the bumbling amateur actor: it gives SRK a chance to show off his underused (at least in films), slightly edgy and subtle sense of humor.

Have not seen this and do not really intend to. Trust Priyadarshan to take a precious little movie and mangle it with his overblown and vulgar aesthetics. [It was originally made in Malayalam - called "Katha Parayumbol"] He is really one of the worst and to think that he made Virasat - before he found success with his formula. Anyways, you might be right because as far as I know, both were shot in this picturesque little village called Pollachi in southern India - Tamil Nadu. Nice work ;)
To each their own, I suppose. I felt the same way you did about Billu about Luck By Chance - I kept wishing for a fast forward button! Billu was the movie I wished Luck By Chance had been... :D
Well, Bhargav didn't like it either, so the PPCC isn't alone. I wonder whether this or LBC will be my cuppa? Or both? Of course, all I can DO is wonder considering where I live. LOL
Well, I guess I'll just go and see it with a box of chocolates. I'm waiting to see Lara Dutta used well in some film. Though I must say she was the saving grace of 'Jhoom Barabar Jhoom'.
And it's going to be a long, long while until someone beats Rishi Kapoor's Romy Rolly.
OMG I cannot think of what to say other than "How is it that we disagree on this one so much?" And also both you and Manish liked Aaja Nachle better, which I thought was lame.
All the more reason someone needs to work out the science of teleportation to we can to go movies together and talk about them in situ and then over our Shashiccinos.
Also - no love for the lightsaber? I about fell out of my chair!
Oh we agree on this one absolutely. I liked SRK being himself, and LOVED Lara to bits, but that was about it. SOmehow the film didnt work for me at all :S
Hi P-PCC. Most of my friends (in India even) agree with your opinion, and I'd rather spend time on something else after suffering through Rab Ne. Thank you for your review. Cheers.
Srinivas - I was so surprised to read all these scathing commentaries about Priyadarshan, as I've only ever seen Virasat - which was GENIUS.
Filmi Girl - It's funny that two films about similar topics but with such radically different sensibilities should come out within a few weeks of each other! I did like some things about Billu, but I just felt over-saturated with the topic and couldn't help comparing it to LBC!
Ajnabi - Thanks for the link! I'd be interested in hearing your take once you get a chance to see them!
Banno - KYAAA?! You didn't like JBJ?!!!
Banno2 - Amen to that. The more I think about that film, the more I remember how great the whole Rolly family was - like those surreal scenes when they visit the theater to gauge the audience reaction, or celebrate the recent knife fights that erupted over tickets. Sanjay Kapoor was a revelation - so hilarious!
Beth - It's like 1960s Shashi versus 1970s Shashi! The twain shall never meet. :)
Beth2 - Alas, the joke fell flat for me since I had already seen it again and again in the trailers! (Though, out of sheer loyalty to Star Wars, I will say that, yes, it was pretty hilarious.)
Shweta - I'm a bit tired of SRK playing himself... when's he going to be Mogambo 2?! Now THAT will be a good move for him.
theBollywoodFan - Thanks for visiting! Yeah, alas, the SRK pyaar is getting seriously burnt this season - I haven't seen a redeeming film of his since Om Shanti Om! I should probably take down the poster from my pantry.
Do NOT take down the poster! Do NOT admit defeat!
And then go watch your favorite SRK role and be reminded.
HAHA..sorry I got a little carried away, but I do hate the guy. In the late 80s etc, he made some terrific Malayalam movies - they were mostly small in scale but with some tightly knit storylines and wonderful performances.
Then in the mid 90s he moved to Hindi and started remaking the same Malayalam movies with no success. Even Viraasat was a frame by frame remake of Thevar Magan, he lucked out with actors of the calibre of Anil Kapoor, Amrish Puri, Tabu, Milind etc. Not to take away from his contribution.
And then he stuck gold with his "comedies".. loud, obnoxious remakes of the early Malayalam hits of the 80s and most of them not his own!!! Hulchul, Hungama, Garam Masala ..each one worse than the other. Each one featuring Paresh Rawal in some variation of the pathetic loser role. Just too much to bear when compared to what the movies were originally. And this guy has the cheek to call Slumdog Millionaire "Cheap" in one of his interviews.!
Coming late to this post, but Srinivas was right. This was a beautiful, touching movie in Malayalam, and you need to see Mammootty play the superstar to see how to underplay a character. In Katha Parayumbol, the real 'hero' was Srinivasan (the barber).
As for Virasat being 'genius' - it would be, wouldn't it? It was a scene by scene copy of Thevar Magan, which was directed by Bharatan. The screenplay was Kamal Hassan's. Priyan didn't have to do much 'direction'.
What I cannot forgive him for is his wholesale massacre of another *great* Malayalam movie called 'Manichitrathazhu' (an atrocity called Bhool Bhulaiyya).
But I like Irfan and Lara too, though I could hardly bare to watch Billo for them.An award-winning New York architect is part of the team revamping a downtown Dallas skyscraper.

By S Bachan Jeet Singh - HYDERABAD
Published: 01st January 2014 08:24 AM
Last Updated: 01st January 2014 08:24 AM
If consumers find purchasing vegetables a big pain in the neck or just do not have the time to visit market or skills to pick the freshest vegetables from crowded market places, here is some good news to them.
The Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation, in coordination with the state marketing department, will launch an initiative, ‘Manakuragayalu’, to provide vegetables at people’s doorstep in about 100 locations in the twin cities.
The fresh vegetables on wheels will involve unemployed youth forming into self help groups and sell fresh vegetables grown by farmers and farming entrepreneurs.
The directorate of marketing has identified as many as 100 locations to sell fresh vegetables at citizens’ doorstep. The department will act a facilitator between farmers and consumers as direct marketing of vegetable produce will eliminate middlemen and makes the farmer directly responsible for selling his/her produce through SHGs who, in turn, will sell to the consumers at their doorstep.
Chief executive officer (CEO), Rythu Bazaar, MK Singh told Express that the initiative would have three benefits. Farmers in the cluster of Rangareddy and Medak districts will supply freshly harvested vegetables to unemployed youth (SHGs), who collect vegetables from farms and carry them to the designated mobile vegetable sales outlets listed out by the department and sell the vegetables in retail which will be cheaper than the market price.
‘’We are in the process of finalising the details with the GHMC shortly and the initiative will be launched on Ugadi’’ Singh added.
The consumers will get quality of vegetables at cheaper rates. The prices will be a little higher than those at Rythu Bazaars but the vegetables can be bought at one’s doorstep, he added.
The GHMC will provide bank linkage to the SHGs for purchasing vehicles by providing 50 percent loan subsidy and will identify 100 groups for selling vegetables, additional commissioner (UCD) D.Jayaraj Kennedy said.
GHMC officials said that the dreams of farmers and unemployed youth would come true by fetching them better rate and offering lower prices to consumers, thus avoiding exploitation by middlemen.
Chief secretary PK Mohanty is keen on the scheme and wants the GHMC and marketing department to start the process at the earliest. The two held a meeting at the HGHMC’s head office near Tank Bund on Tuesday to discuss the nitty-gritty of the“ Genre: Sci-Fi / Fantasy / Author: Jennifer Rardin / Paperback / 320 Pages / Book is published 2007-10-18 by Orbit „

Following the unprecedented, and it could be said, largely undeserved, success of the Twilight books, there is a plethora of urban fantasy fiction on the market these days featuring vampires, werewolves, fae and other weird and wonderful creatures of the paranormal world. To my mind, much of this fiction is often poorly conceived and some of it very badly written, so finding a new writer of decent urban fantasy can sometimes be like looking for a needle in a haystack. I think with Jennifer Rardin, however, I just might have found a good one.
About the author
Jennifer Rardin was an American writer based in Illinois. She had her first urban fantasy novel featuring Jaz Parks and her partner, the vampire Vayle, published in 2007 which was an immediate success. She went on to write and publish a further six more books in the series. Very sadly, Jennifer Rardin died unexpectedly last September at the age of 45 shortly after completing the eighth in the Jaz Parks series which is due for release in 2011.
Synopsis
Jasmine (Jaz) Parks has been assigned by the CIA to work in black ops alongside Vayl, an enigmatic and lethal Rumanian vampire who is nearly 300 years old. Ostensibly Jaz is Vayl's bodyguard but why a lethal vampire would require protection is something Jaz can't fathom. It soon becomes clear, however, that she's been drafted in to help Vayl foil a plot to release a soul-eating demon who has the capability to destroy the world if she falls into the hands of the Sons of Paradise, a vile organisation bent on world destruction. And as if that wasn't going to be hard enough, Jaz has a problem she's unwilling to share with anyone. She's having blackouts and the things that happen during that time may mean she loses not only her CIA contract but her life.
Price and availability
This book is currently available from Amazon for £4.89 although used copies can also by bought starting at a price of £1.40 plus P&P.
My opinion
I've now written several reviews on urban fantasy and make no bones about my enjoyment of this genre which marries reality with fantasy making for a much more believable world than the more accepted forms of fantasy fiction. I know that many people feel that the vampire has been overdone in fiction these days and that there's nothing original about them anymore but Jennifer Rardin has produced in Vayl, one of the species who earns his living doing what vampires do best: killing and also displays characteristics which I feel are more in keeping with someone who's been alive for approaching three centuries.
Of course, Jaz and Vayl don't kill goodies only evil people who are trying to destroy the world and, as Jaz says, "If you think that makes me a bad guy, that's your problem." At the beginning of this first book of the series, we meet Jaz, who is the first person narrator of the story, and Vayl as they attend a party incognito in an attempt to discover the whereabouts of a deadly virus the terrorist organisation, the Sons of Paradise are planning to release upon an unsuspecting world.
As with all first books in a series, there is a certain amount of character introduction and world building which can sometimes slow down the actual story but this isn't the case here. Jaz manages to convey exactly what's happening as well as bring the reader up to speed on previous events and all without slowing the pace one iota. We therefore learn very early on in the book that Jaz is a kick-ass kind of person with a smart mouth who is a modern woman with a strong independent streak but that she has a problem she's trying to resolve without Vayl or the CIA finding out.
Jaz and Vayl make a great team and this is an action-packed and frequently violent urban fantasy with the added attractions of elements of the spy thriller about it and in many ways it's no more fantastical than a James Bond adventure. Jaz is a likeable heroine with a wry sense of humour, who's constantly battling authority which usually comes in the shape of her boss, Pete, a penny pincher if ever there was one. Jaz is always concerned that she may lose her job, especially as she seems to have a habit of totalling her cars and generally creating havoc wherever she operates. This is the first book in the series and I get the feeling that there is still a great deal of Jaz's back story still to come out which is certainly an incentive to keep reading the series.
Vayl on the other hand is a vampire with a difference because he's a wraith. This means that not only does he have the usual attributes of a vampire but also has the capability of freezing his victims to death. Despite this ability, he's rather likable too and the chemistry between him and Jaz is almost palpable giving a foretaste of a romance to come, I think. What I really like about Vayl is that he has a certain world-weariness, which I'm sure is how someone would be after being alive for nearly three hundred years. You must have just about experienced everything by then and keeping interested in the world around would be quite tough at times. Vayl also has a certain old-world charm about him, despite living in the modern age, again which seems much more in keeping with how a 'real' vampire would behave.
The secondary characters are all as well drawn as Jaz and Vayl although the terrorist group are perhaps just a little bit too stereotypical to be believed at times. However, fanaticism comes in many guises and it isn't too difficult to suspend belief.
This first adventure has really kick-started what promises to be an excellent series and it's certainly left me wanting more. I've already bought book two, 'Another One Bites the Dust', which is in my waiting to be read pile and if that turns out to be as good as the first, I'll be looking to read the remainder of the series.
The books in the series are:

2. Another One Bites the Dust
3. Biting the Bullet
4. Bitten to Death
5. One More Bite
6. Bite Marks
7. Bitten in Two

President, Honda Performance Development, Inc.
A 28-year veteran of Honda Motor Company in a variety of positions, including Formula One, Yasuhiro Wada assumed his new duties as president of Honda Performance Development on February 1 of this year.
In typical Japanese fashion, "Wada-san" joined Honda out of college in 1974. Since then, his wide-ranging career has taken him to positions with the company in Japan, Europe and the United States, including stints in corporate planning, sales, public relations and product development.
While in the U.S. in the late 1980s, Mr. Wada was heavily involved in the launch of the premium Acura division. Soon after, he took on his first motorsports position, with American Honda's IMSA sports car racing program and the championship-winning efforts of driver Parker Johnstone and the Comptech team. Ten years later, Mr. Wada was overseeing Honda's touring car racing programs in England and Europe. In April 2000 he was appointed General Manager, Motor Sports Division, responsible for the start up of Honda's current Formula One racing program.
As president of Honda Performance Development, Mr. Wada will be responsible for the development of HPD into a fully self-supporting manufacturing and engineering facility. He also will oversee the company's IRL IndyCar Series racing program.Electrolux EW27MC65JS Wave-Touch 27" Stainless Steel Electric Combination?

Load time is already a quality factor for AdWords and there is a strong chance that speed will factor into the organic ranking algorithm.

I can see more of a problem with dynamic sites use a sql database that loads to slow.
This is good for those of us that also use Google to search for information.
At least if they implement this it will be less likely that we stumble upon slow-loading websites.
That's kind of tricky though, my site never ever has the same speed - some days it's slow, some days it's fast. How is Google going to keep up with these kind of changes?
ooohhh noooo!!! isn't it unfair now to sites like photo sharing sites?
Well yes you can say that image sites might be discriminated a bit against plain sites. But then again it has always been like that. Image sites have always been hard to optimize than plain text sites due to lack on content that search engines understand.
What's interesting to be seen is HOW-MUCH Google weighs this factor if included in those 200 factors.

If there's an aspiring social-networking overlord among today's crop of billionaire barons, you can bet it's Barry Diller, CEO of IAC/InterActiveCorp (Nasdaq: IACI ) . He's the one who desperately needs a second life.

IAC launched Zwinktopia in April, a site for preteens that's somewhat reminiscent of what Ganz is doing with Webkinz, and what Disney (NYSE: DIS ) is doing with Virtual Magic Kingdom and its recently acquiredClub Penguin.
And business is good. TechCrunch reports that Zwinktopia now has 4.6 million active users, who average 64 minutes a day of online time.
How valuable is that? Users have spent more than 500 million in Zwinktopia's virtual currency, known as "Zbucks," since the site's launch. Zbucks can be either earned online or purchased from IAC, which sells batches of 2,000 for $10 in cold, hard moola.
Advertising and sponsorship opportunities add to Zwinktopia's revenue engine.
Barry Diller ... this is your Second Life
Obviously, there's an opportunity here. But social networking is also like fashion; its patrons are fickle. Just ask the good folks at Linden Lab, creators of the iconic Second Life virtual world.
Think of Second Life as a Web-based version of Electronic Arts' (Nasdaq: ERTS ) The Sims, but with all the accoutrements of the real world: currency, entertainment, work, shopping, and so on, all run on a platform powered by Intel's (Nasdaq: INTC ) latest acquisition. For months, Linden's virtual world had been social networking's cool kid. Growth had gone wild. Even the IRS was interested.
And now? Not so much. According to a new report from researcher Yankee Group, Second Life has almost become passe. Residents are spending just 12 minutes online a month, Yankee says. By comparison, social-networking superstar Facebook -- which could be valued at a lofty $10 billion -- keeps its readers occupied for 186 minutes a month.
Apparently, Second Life needs is some spice. A partner to liven things up. IAC could be that partner. Wait; let me rephrase that. It should be that partner.
Think of the possibilities. Match.com and Chemistry could each offer virtual dating services to Second Life residents. LendingTree could offer loans to would-be Second Life Trumps. Ticketmaster could sell seats to Second Life concerts. Front Line Management could book acts. And so on.
For the most part, social networking is a distraction. Diller could make it more useful and, in the process, more profitable. Think about it. What if you could arrange a virtual date on Second Life before spending $100 on an awkward "so what do you do?" outing to the local Chili's?
My point is simple: Profits follow utility. Right now, Second Life doesn't offer enough utility to transform it from a neat time-waster into a cash-producing e-monster -- the sort of business that Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT ) appears to believe Facebook has become.
Let Google be Google
As cool as it sounds to have avatars strolling Google Earth, it's hard to ignore that DoubleGoo does best when it boots you off its site and toward the furthest reaches of the Web -- preferably to a site that paid to get you there.
Could that change? Sure, but in the here and now, Second Life needs a boost. It needs help crafting a more compelling universe, one that's accessible anywhere. Does anyone do that job better than Diller?
Not in this life.

You can find that article <a href="">here</a>.<div><br /></div><div>I'm not sure if I'll get the chance to post future work there, but I can at least say that seeing the following this morning was pretty cool: </div><div><br /><;">As always, thanks for reading. It means a lot.</div>Matt Kremnitzer case there was any doubt, Alfred Morris is still awesomeIn case you were wondering that first-year success would change Alfred Morris, you don't have to worry. He's still smart, humble, and willing to put in the necessary hard work.<br /><br />In <a href="">a recent interview</a>:<br /><blockquote>."</blockquote" <a href="">on Twitter</a>. If Morris ever said something like that, I think my head would explode. Then again, when you're an NFL quarterback and a superstar athlete, I guess everything you do or say is news. No pressure, no diamonds, and all that.<br /><br />Anyway, Griffin is fantastic and is insanely talented, but I prefer the previously unheralded Morris. Not only is he a powerful and skilled running back, but he's <i>still</i> holding onto <a href="">his 1991 Mazda</a>."<br /><br />That's more like it.Matt Kremnitzer Magic, Manny Machado editionHere's Manny Machado's go-ahead three-run bomb last night to complete the Orioles' ninth-inning comeback against the Red Sox. The Fenway Park faithful -- at least the ones still remaining -- were not happy:<br /><br /><iframe frameborder="0" height="224" src="" width="400">Your browser does not support iframes.</iframe><br /><br /><a href="">Machado magic</a>, indeed.Matt Kremnitzer quick note on John WallThis is John Wall's third season. Here are his field goal percentages in those years:<br /><br />2010-11: 40.9<br />2011-12: 42.3<br />2012-13: 41.6<br /><br />But here are his percentages from the free throw line:<br /><br />2010-11: 76.6<br />2011-12: 78.9<br />2012-13: 83.2<br /><br />Obviously free throws are different than jump shots. There's no one guarding you, you're not jumping, you can take your time, etc. But that's at least a little confusing.<br /><br />In last night's 95-90 loss to the Kyrie Irving-less Cavaliers, Wall had 27 points (and 14 assists) on 7-15 shooting -- not bad. But he also hit 13 of 14 free throws. Maybe instead of saying things like, <a href="">"Everywhere is my sweet spot,"</a> he should just talk about his progress from the free throw line.<br /><br /><br />Matt Kremnitzer Beal, quick learnerBradley Beal is 19 years old. He's also on the Washington Wizards. And since he's both young and on the Wizards, it's surprising that he's actually getting better -- and fast. Check out his numbers by month:<br /><br /><table><tbody><tr><th>Month</th><th>Pts </th><th>FG% </th><th>3pt%</th><th>Reb</th><th>Ast</th></tr><tr><td>November</td><td>11.2</td><td>34.1</td><td>32.7</td><td>3.3</td><td>1.6</td></tr><tr><td>December</td><td>13.4</td><td>36.8</td><td>18.4</td><td>3.9</td><td>3.4</td></tr><tr><td>January</td><td>15.1</td><td>44.7</td><td>50.8</td><td>2.8</td><td>2.5</td></tr><tr><td>February</td><td>17.7</td><td>47.8</td><td>50.0</td><td>5.0</td><td>2.4</td></tr></tbody></table><br />That's more points per month on better overall shooting. Those five rebounds per game in February are looking pretty good. The dip in assists from December to January/February also coincides with John Wall's return from injury.<br /><br />Beal is playing well and shooting the ball with confidence. He's not only one of the main reasons why the Wizards are winning, but also why they're so fun to watch right now. And hopefully he stays hungry (not an Andray Blatche kind of hungry).Matt Kremnitzer Camden Depot linksWhen I write Orioles-related articles from now on (for the most part), they'll be posted at <a href="">Camden Depot</a>.

He had a fantastic 2012 season, breaking the Redskins' single-season rushing record -- as a rookie. But he's not just a fan favorite because of his talent, but also because of his <a href="">work ethic</a>, <a href="">charity work</a>, and especially the <a href="">love of his car</a> (his 1991 Mazda). The latter has been the subject of multiple enjoyable stories and quotes, and that was the case <a href="">yet again yesterday</a>.<br /><br />Here's what Morris had to say after teammates joked (possibly) that his car would never make it to Florida if he drove there during the offseason: <br /><blockquote>.” </blockquote>That's right: "I kind of just ride to my thoughts." Don't ever change, Alfred. Matt Kremnitzer news (and a new Camden Depot post)I'm now contributing to <a href="">Camden Depot</a>, so things will be quieter around here during the MLB season.

Let's use a couple of Robert Griffin III's ongoing rookie season statistics to help. Most people would agree that Griffin has easily been one of the most exciting players of the 2012 NFL season so far. Here are some of his numbers: 18/4 TD:INT ratio, 66.4 completion percentage, 8.3 yards per pass attempt, and 6.7 yards per rush.<br /><br />Those last two numbers both lead the NFL, which is remarkable. No one in NCAA football is in Griffin's class (that's not an insult), but several quarterbacks still put up great numbers.<br /><br />Heisman Trophy winner Johnny Manziel of Texas A&M averaged 8.5 yards per pass attempt and 6.4 yards per rush, and Oregon's Marcus Mariota also had solid passing (8.0) and rushing (7.0) averages. Jordan Lynch of Northern Illinois was also impressive, posting averages of 8.4 yards through the air and 6.5 yards on the ground. But unless you want to count the Heisman winner or two other quarterbacks who are playing in BCS bowls, you'll have to look elsewhere for a more obscure, but still exciting, name.<br /><br />And that player is quarterback Terrance Broadway of Louisiana-Lafayette, who averaged 8.9 yards per pass attempt and 6.4 yards per rush. Broadway, a sophomore transfer from Houston, threw for 2,526 yards with 16 touchdowns and eight interceptions, while also running for 661 yards and eight touchdowns. Obviously at least two quarterbacks above played against much better competition, but we're just looking at some numbers here. It's bowl season, after all.<br /><br />Broadway's Ragin' Cajuns will be facing off against East Carolina in the R+L Carriers New Orleans Bowl on December 22. Don't be surprised if Broadway makes a few big plays.<br /><br /><br />Matt Kremnitzer they're saying about Maryland and the Big TenI'm mostly out of my element when talking about topics like conference realignment or college athletic department finances, but let me add my two cents anyway about Maryland's departure from the ACC (in 2014). I'm disappointed, and I'll miss the tough games against Duke, UNC, etc. Those games (when competitive) were obviously a joy to watch.<br /><br />Over the years, I've slowly lost interest in college football, and football is the driving factor in Maryland heading to the Big Ten. I have no doubt that Maryland football will continue to struggle whether they play in the ACC or Big Ten; however, Mark Turgeon and the basketball program should be just fine. And, really, that's what I care about the most. As long as Maryland basketball keeps improving and starts winning lots of games again, it won't matter to me what conference Maryland's in. (Which is important, because they may be in another conference in 20 years.)<br /><br />As has been repeated elsewhere ad nauseum, the move makes sense for Maryland's athletic department; that influx of cash means they'll be able to do/pay for more things. (Smart things, hopefully.) But that doesn't mean it's a perfect move, either. Important decisions are made all the time, and things eventually change. That's fine, but that also doesn't mean fans and alumni won't miss the ACC or easily forget about it.<br /><br />Occasional Krem's Sports correspondent Walt Williams (<a href="">follow him</a> on Twitter) also weighed in on the subject:<br /><br />"I haven’t come here to tell you that the University of Maryland should have never answered the call of the Big Ten Network and the purported millions that will come with it. I haven’t even come to lament the loss of home basketball games against Duke and North Carolina. That time would have come when the ACC decided to place in motion the conference raiding that began the national game of musical chairs that may ironically lead to its own demise with the addition of Virginia Tech and Miami. I also can tell you that I most certainly haven’t made an appearance to champion the academic benefits of this move. Especially since the university itself can’t do that with a straight face or without coming back to the importance of finances. Yes, the two things I have come here to talk about are the primary motivations of Maryland’s move to the Big Ten: Money and Football.<br /><br />Looking at the financials, or at least what we’ve heard about them, Maryland is projecting that they will see an increase of 100 million dollars in conference revenue from the Big Ten by 2020. That number, even if it is extremely inflated, is sorely needed to help put Maryland’s athletic department on slightly more stable ground. That money could also be used for student athlete support that is sorely lacking at Maryland and has been for years. Whether Maryland uses the extra money for those modest things or overpaying for overmatched football coaches remains to be seen but we can hope for the best. The only possible hiccup in the financial calculations could be the long term viability of the Big Ten network in its current capacity. That is to say, the long term viability of basic cable as we know it now is tied to the viability of the Big Ten and now Maryland. Is it too far-fetched to think that by 2020 the current model of getting a bundle of networks as a part of your cable package could be jettisoned for a more customer friendly pick and choose model? If not, what would happen to profitability of the network and the Big Ten’s members if profit depended on a large number of individuals actively choosing to have access to the Big Ten network instead of having it forced on them? I believe these are all interesting questions to think about for the future. Right now however, there is no need to say that Maryland or Rutgers would be mooching off of the Big Ten’s success. Both schools by virtue of their television markets are as valuable to the Big Ten as the Big Ten is to them. I may be wrong but I don’t believe Jim Delany and the Big Ten are going to go around and give handouts unless they feel like they are getting something valuable in return. In the case of Maryland that value is probably going to be solely on the demographic side of things as the Terps aren’t likely to do anything of note in football for the foreseeable future.<br /><br />Looking at the conference switch from the perspective of the Maryland football program, there is nothing I can say except that this probably won’t go well at all. Now I’m not saying that the Big Ten is the best football conference in the country or even close to it. There is no doubt though, that the Big Ten is worlds better at this point than the ACC has been in the past decade or so. Add in the fact that Maryland is at the moment a cellar dweller in the ACC and you get a recipe for long Saturday afternoons starting in 2014. Does anyone look forward to the sight of Randy Edsall attempting to match wits or talent with Urban Meyer, Bill O’Brien, Bret Bielema, or Brady Hoke? I know I certainly do not. Looking at the Big Ten right now the only team Maryland is probably unquestionably above is Illinois. Unless the Big Ten has some sort of starter introductory schedule for bad football teams where Maryland can play Illinois, Indiana, and Minnesota twice it's hard to see how Randy Edsall will get a chance to finish out his contract, especially with the new conference money coming in. Of course, that’s if he even makes it to 2014 to begin with.<br /><br />So basically this move to the Big Ten comes down to money, security, and football. While the first two should hopefully be taken care of in the short term, the football may take a while to come around. So I’m going to spend time the next 18 months or so warming up to stale beer and bratwurst and trying to learn the difference between leaders and legends. It can’t be too bad, right?"<br /><br />-----<br /><br />Here's what some other writers/commentators/former coaches are saying about the move:<br /><br />- ." -- <a href="">Thomas Boswell</a><br /><br />- "I just see it as part of the collegiate culture. The Big Ten wants that market for TV and Maryland wants more money or else they wouldn’t be making that move. I think it’s money-driven, but I kind of hate to see it because there were some really great rivalries there. I still recall some of the great games we had, and basketball in the ACC was even bigger with Carolina and Duke." -- <a href="">Bobby Ross</a><br /><br />- "I know a lot of people talk about traditions, they talk about, 'What? No more Maryland-Duke? No more Maryland-North Carolina?' Well, ever since a couple of years ago when they limited Maryland to playing both of those schools not twice but once, that took care of that. I really love it when you go to Duke and get knocked off and run out of the place and come back here and beat ‘em at Comcast Center. And Carolina the same way. But I’m looking forward to it. I think academically it’s good, athletically it’s terrific. The money, you certainly can’t turn your back and say, 'No, we want to continue the way we’re going.' And now it gives an opportunity for those sports that were cut, some of them, hopefully all of them, will be able to be brought back." -- <a href="">Johnny Holliday</a><br /><br />-  <i>good</i> thing. The games would still be sellouts." -- <a href="">John Feinstein</a><br /><br />- "When you look around and see what’s going on — Notre Dame’s personal contract with NBC for football and being able to come into the ACC without football — just watching teams like Nebraska, who you never would think would be a member of the Big Ten — we all have to look at what’s best for the university. If you want to be successful in basketball and football, that takes certain finances to do that. Why would Syracuse and Pitt go to the ACC? Why would Nebraska go to Big Ten? The answer is pretty obvious. We shouldn't feel bad about doing what other schools have done to increase the exposure, to increase the validity of their programs." -- <a href="">Gary Williams</a><br /><br />- . One minute they’re shaking hands and talking about what’s great about the sport itself, and then as soon as they get through shaking hands, they go and raid one another’s leagues. It’s situational ethics at its height, at its absolute height." -- <a href="">Tim Brando</a><br /><br />- ." -- <a href="">Gene Corrigan</a>, former ACC commissioner<br /><br />- "The Big Ten Network is a money-making machine, and the conference actually made more money last year than even the SEC. Last fall, when I spent a day with the <a href="">Indiana football program</a>, they informed me that they'd been able to upgrade their facilities almost entirely with money procured from their Big Ten Network share. But that's what makes this so frustrating for those of us who actually give a damn about the product: <a href="">Speaking to Rittenberg</a>, [Big Ten Commissioner]." -- <a href="">Michael Weinreb</a><br /><br />- !" -- <a href="">Kevin Plank</a><br /><br />- "But I realize that what I feel nostalgic about is something that was lost a long time ago.... Syracuse and Pitt are coming to the league and that means that going forward, Maryland was guaranteed in basketball two home-and-homes: with Pitt and Virginia. Now I don’t mean any disrespect to Pittsburgh, but they don’t mean any more to Maryland than Maryland means to them. And that was supposed to be our rival, going forward? And speaking of rivals — or, not our rival — so many Maryland folks now are lamenting the loss of what we would call The Duke Game. And let’s remember, folks: that’s a school that doesn’t see Maryland the way Maryland sees them. But besides that larger point, in the immediate future, there’d be far more years in basketball where you would not have a home game against Duke than years that you would." -- <a href="">Scott Van Pelt</a><br /><br />- "But.... <i>not the same thing</i>. And that deep well of sentiment, not the conferences’ ability to exploit a series of local cable cartels, is its ultimate source of value." -- <a href="">Jonathan Chait</a><br /><br />- "But the reality is that it is a GREAT move for Maryland (and, arguably, even more for Rutgers), and -- yes -- it is entirely about the money.Maryland athletics is in terrible shape financially. Joining the Big Ten and its ATM of a cable network will help immeasurably. From the Big Ten's standpoint, expanding the footprint is mandatory in a 'super-conference' world, and it is most ideal to do it in big markets like DC and NYC. I have no patience for people griping 'What about the tradition!?' Those people don't have to finance college athletics. You can lament the end of the Maryland-Duke rivalry while agreeing the move makes sense." -- <a href="">Dan Shanoff</a><br /><br /><i>Some quotes/paragraphs were combined to save space.</i> Matt Kremnitzer quick look at Panthers-Redskins.<br /><br /.<br /><br /.<br /><br /.<br /><br /.<br /><br /.Matt Kremnitzer's time in Washington has been embarrassing<span style="font-family: inherit;">The DeAngelo Hall era (which should end after this season, since he's <a href="">not due any guaranteed money in 2013</a>) has not gone well.

In that season, they went 98-64 and finished first in the AL East. Since that year, here's where they've finished in the AL East:<br /><div><br /></div><div>- fourth place for six straight seasons;</div><div>- third place in 2004;</div><div>- fourth place in 2005-2007; and</div><div>- fifth place in the four seasons after that.</div><div><br /></div><div>And then, with not much hope to be much better (<a href="">Dan Duquette's goal</a> before the season was "to be .500 or better"), the 2012 Orioles somehow won 93 games, eliminated in the new one-game wild card playoff a Texas Rangers team that had participated in the last two World Series, and gave the Yankees all they could handle by forcing a fifth game in the American League Division Series. </div><div><br />The weird thing about the Orioles this season is that, except for few minor (or at least apparently minor) names here or there, the roster wasn't THAT much different from 2011. Here's the opening day lineup on April 1, 2011:<br /><br />Brian Roberts 2B<br />Nick Markakis RF<br />Derrek Lee 1B<br />Vladimir Guerrero DH<br />Adam Jones CF<br />Luke Scott LF<br />Mark Reynolds 3B<br />Matt Wieters C<br />J.J. Hardy SS<br /><br />Remember Derrek Lee and Vladimir Guerrero? I bet you didn't. Sorry. I won't go through the entire 2011 pitching staff, but there were many of the same names -- particularly the younger pitchers -- but there weren't nearly as many strong performances as this season.<br /><br />And here was the opening day roster on April 6, 2012:<br /><br />Nolan Reimold LF<br />J.J. Hardy SS<br />Nick Markakis RF<br />Adam Jones CF<br />Matt Wieters C<br />Wilson Betemit DH<br />Mark Reynolds 3B<br />Chris Davis 1B<br />Robert Andino 2B<br /><br />And don't forget, oddly enough, that Jake Arrieta started that game. Reimold started the season on fire and homered in four straight games (and in five of six games), but he was eventually lost for the season because of a herniated disc in his neck, and he didn't appear in another game after April 30. You'll also notice Reynolds at third base, a healthy Markakis, and Betemit's presence in the lineup.<br /><br />But, OK, I'm rambling. How did the O's get from that 2011 roster to facing off against the Yankees in the ALDS? The winning close games thing is obvious now and has been beaten into the ground. It truly was amazing what the Orioles did in close and extra-inning games, but let's explore some of the major and minor moves, in no particular order:<br /><ul><li>Signing Wei-Yin Chen</li></ul><div>It wasn't discussed all that much at the time, but the Orioles got a bargain when they signed Chen to a three-year, $11.38 million deal in January. His deal also includes a $4.75 million club option in 2015. Chen, now 27, gave the O's a 4.02/4.42/4.34 (ERA/FIP/xFIP) pitching line in 192.2 innings, which isn't superb but is still pretty good for a rookie making his way through AL East lineups. He stayed healthy the entire season, and though the O's did try to give him a few extra days between starts at the end of the season because he began to tire somewhat, he was arguably the team's most reliable starter from April to October.</div><div><br /></div><div>Chen may never pitch better than he did this season, but there's no reason he can't at least be close to it. And for the contract he signed, there's absolutely nothing wrong with that.</div><div><ul><li>Putting Darren O'Day on the roster</li></ul><div>It's hard to believe after the incredible season he had, but O'Day (and Troy Patton, for that matter) <a href="">was not a lock to make the 25-man roster</a> before the season. O'Day was lights out in 67 regular season innings, finishing with a 2.28 ERA. Because he didn't finish with a bunch of saves like Jim Johnson, who was also very good this season, O'Day didn't receive the same notoriety (until he kept mowing down batters in the playoffs, at least), but he was every bit as valuable. Fortunately for the Orioles, O'Day is still arbitration eligible, though he should expect a nice raise after a fantastic season.</div></div><div><ul><li>Moving Mark Reynolds to first base</li></ul></div><div>It took much longer than it needed to, but Buck Showalter eventually stopped playing Reynolds at third base. Reynolds never played third after May, and the position was instead occupied mostly by Wilson Betemit and Robert Andino (at least until a certain 20-year-old took over the position; more on that below). A Betemit/Andino platoon wasn't the worst thing ever, but it also wasn't ideal. Betemit isn't very good defensively but can hit right-handed pitching a bit, and Andino fields well and is an OK hitters against lefties. But, again, it wasn't perfect.<br /><br />Reynolds has improved his defense immensely at first. I'm still hesitant to call him great, or at least very good, at the position, mostly because I think he needs to work on his footwork, mostly around the bag. (That would explain why no other first baseman ends up diving for nearly as many throws.) Still, he at least went from average or below average at first base to slightly above average or decent, which is still impressive for a guy who looks as bad on the other side of the diamond.</div><div><br /></div><div>He improved his on-base percentage from .323 in 2011 to .335 this season, which can mostly be explained by his uptick in walks (from a 12.1 BB% to 13.6%). But that wasn't enough to make up for his 54-point drop in slugging percentage to .429, the lowest of his career.</div><div><br /></div><div>Reynolds has a 2013 team option for $11 million, which seems a little steep, especially since he's been worth a combined 0.8 fWAR the past two seasons. Like Luke Scott the season before, Reynolds could be a non-tender candidate, though I wouldn't be all that surprised if he somehow returned for less money. Reynolds has some value, but he's not worth $11 million.</div><div><ul><li>Signing Miguel Gonzalez</li></ul></div><div>Prior to this season, I had never heard of Gonzalez. I don't think most fans had, either. But signing him to a minor-league deal when no other team was interested ended up being a very wise decision. In late May and early June when guys like Jake Arrieta and Brian Matusz were struggling mightily as starters, the O's needed someone to eat innings, so Gonzalez got his chance. He pitched well out of the bullpen a few times, and he eventually got his first Orioles start on July 6 against the Angels, when he pitched seven innings, allowing one run on three hits, while striking out six and walking two. He continued to pitch well after that, with only a few bad outings, and was one of the biggest reasons why the starting rotation exceeded expectations.</div><div><br /></div><div>I'm not sure if he'll pitch as well in future seasons, but it's not like a 28-year-old, oft-injured journeyman starter/reliever is supposed to be easy to predict. He's obviously earned a shot at a rotation spot next season, and if he pitches well again, it's a tremendous bonus.<br /><ul><li>Signing Nick Johnson</li></ul>OK, just kidding. Still, this actually happened. And you're not going to believe it, but he got hurt. But he did have a couple of important hits. Oh, and look at <a href="">his Twitter handle</a>. So, yeah.<br /><ul><li>Promoting Manny Machado from Bowie</li></ul>I'm not going to say watching Machado's development was the most exciting thing this season, but it was easily <i>one of</i> <i>the</i> most exciting things. Machado, 20, made his major-league debut on August 9, collecting his first two hits. The next night, he upped the ante by hitting two home runs and knocking in four runs. After that, things cooled off for Machado somewhat, and by the end of the season he batted .262/.294/.445 in 202 plate appearances.<br /><br />His plate discipline needs to get better, but that was something he improved as the season went on. He also started to look more comfortable when hitting with two strikes. While the O's struggled to score runs in the ALDS, Machado was one of the few Baltimore hitters to actually have a few nice at-bats. That didn't necessarily translate into big offensive numbers, but his talent is evident. With more playing time and exposure, Machado should become a potent, middle-of-the-order hitter in the next couple of years.<br /><br />Oh, and he was outstanding at third base and helped fortify the team's infield defense. That seems important for someone who never played the position in the minors.<br /><ul><li>Trading for Jason Hammel (and Matt Lindstrom)</li></ul><div>At the time, <a href="">the trade looked OK</a>, but nothing special. And then Hammel started pitching, and he was very good from day one. If not for a <a href="">right knee injury</a> that limited him to just 118 innings, Hammel likely would have posted the best numbers of his career (he basically did anyway, though, just in fewer innings). He finished with a solid pitching line of 3.43/3.29/3.46, and his 2.9 fWAR was the best among O's pitchers. Chen, who pitched nearly 74 more innings, was the next closest with a 2.2 fWAR. Hammel's wildly effective two-seam fastball produced a ton of ground balls (53.2 GB%), the highest of his career). He also struck out the highest number of batters (8.62 K/9) of his career. And he did all this while keeping his walks relatively low (3.2 BB%) and doing a fantastic job of keeping the ball in the ballpark (0.69 HR/9). </div><div><br /></div><div>Hammel, 30, has one year of arbitration left, so he'll at least be around for another season. But if the 2012 version is indeed the real Hammel, the O's may have found someone who can pitch effectively in their rotation for the next few years. The knee injury is somewhat of a concern, but when healthy, Hammel was outstanding.</div><div><br /></div><div>Lindstrom also pitched well in his 36.1 innings out of the bullpen, posting a 2.72 ERA. Dan Duquette figured he was expendable, though, and shipped Lindstrom to Arizona in late August in exchange for Joe Saunders. In seven regular season starts after arriving in Baltimore, Saunders was actually decent, with a line of 3.63/3.77/4.44 and accumulating 0.8 fWAR. It helped that he was pitching to a few bad/injured lineups (Toronto twice, Seattle once, and Boston once), but those innings and starts helped propel the O's to the playoffs. Also, against all odds, Saunders put together back-to-back effective starts against the Rangers and Yankees in the playoffs. In both outings, he went 5.2 innings and allowed just one run. Saunders may not be in an Orioles uniform next season, but he proved to be a helpful addition, and it only cost the O's a replaceable reliever who has a $4 million team option next season.</div><div><ul><li>Batting Markakis leadoff</li></ul></div><div>It seems like ages ago, but when Markakis returned from his <a href="">first-ever trip</a> to the disabled list after having surgery on his broken right wrist, he was inserted into the leadoff slot in the lineup. From July 13 (when he returned) to September 8 (when an errant CC Sabathia fastball broke Markakis's thumb, ending his season), Markakis batted a whopping .335/.390/.489 and looked like the hitter O's fans had been expecting the last couple of seasons. In those 54 games, Markakis collected 74 hits (he had just 51 hits in his previous 50 games), and he walked six more times than he struck out (20 to 14). </div><div><br /></div><div>Maybe it was just a fluke or an unsustainable hot stretch for Markakis. But he needs to be the team's leadoff hitter on opening day next season, which is something I'm sure Buck Showalter already knows.</div><div><ul><li>Pulling the plug on Matusz, Arrieta, and Hunter as starters</li></ul><div>I still think there's some hope for Brian Matusz and Jake Arrieta as starting pitchers in the future; according to the Orioles, that's still the plan, at least. (Tommy Hunter, though, needs to stay in the bullpen.) But they weren't overly effective in the rotation this season, and eventually the O's decided to send them to the minors to straighten things out. But they didn't return as starters; they returned as relievers.<br /><br />When Arrieta came back, he wasn't all that much different, though his stuff still looked pretty good (it usually does). But when Matusz returned, he had somehow transformed into a power lefty, capable of blowing hitters away with ease. The sequence that sticks out in my mind is when he entered in the play-in game to face Josh Hamilton, and even though Hamilton obviously didn't look right, Matusz blew him away with three straight fastballs. Considering Hamilton had a four-homer game against the Orioles in May and looked dominant at the time, it was a bizarre sequence.<br /><br />Matusz's performance out of the bullpen was something entirely new, and even though he still wants to be a starter (which he should), it had to feel pretty awesome to routinely dominate hitters since returning to Baltimore in August.</div></div><div><br />-----<br /><br />I want to keep going on, and I probably could for a few thousand more words. But instead, I'll just list some of the other keys to this season:<br /><br /><ul><li>Signing Nate McLouth (obviously)</li><li>Giving Chris Davis consistent at-bats</li><li>Trading for Jim Thome (still not sure how wise that trade was, but he had a few big hits)</li><li>Picking up guys like Lew Ford and Omar Quintanilla (who were helpful at times) for basically nothing</li><li>Keeping Rule 5 pick Ryan Flaherty, who could be a decent player</li><li>Using Kevin Gregg <a href="">only when it was necessary</a></li><li>Getting a shot in the arm when a much-improved Chris Tillman returned in July</li><li>Giving Steve Johnson a chance</li><li>Receiving solid years from guys like Pedro Strop, Troy Patton, and Luis Ayala</li></ul><div>That's it. Or, at least, I think that's it. This season was pretty fun, Orioles. How about another?</div></div></div></div>Matt Kremnitzer saves Yankees, puts O's on brink of eliminationAll right, so there's no escaping last night's excruciating 12-inning loss. That one hurts, a lot, and the Orioles really have no one to blame but themselves. Well, OK, they could blame Raul Ibanez for hitting the game-tying and game-winning home runs in consecutive at-bats. Or they could blame Joe Girardi, who had the stones to pinch-hit for Alex Rodriguez, who has only hit 647 home runs in his career, is one of the greatest players in baseball history, and has more than five years and $110 million left on his contract after this season.<br /><br />Most people are blaming Jim Johnson, who allowed that tying home run to Ibanez in the ninth. In his two innings of work, Johnson allowed just that one hit. Some questioned the logic of bringing in Johnson to face at least two lefties (Ichiro and Robinson Cano). And would Rodriguez still have hit if Brian Matusz had entered the game instead of Johnson? Then again, Matusz did allow that second Ibanez homer, so maybe Ibanez was simply destined to become a Yankees postseason legend.<br /><br />But, really, that's what happens in one-run games, and that's why the O's record in close and extra-inning games this season is/was so remarkable. Anything can happen in those types of games -- and even solid players like Johnson occasionally falter. Obviously, though, losing late leads hurts that much more in the playoffs.<br /><br />The O's lineup also didn't do Miguel Gonzalez (who pitched magnificently) or any of the other relievers any favors by not tacking on any runs after Manny Machado's go-ahead solo home run in the fifth inning. It's easy to point the finger at Johnson, who was also bad in the first game of this series when he allowed five hits and four earned runs in a tie game. But J.J. Hardy, Matt Wieters, and Jim Thome all went 0-5 last night. In these few playoff games, Adam Jones is hitting .154/.154/.154. Wieters is hitting .077/.077/.154; Hardy is batting .083/.154/.167. Thome hasn't done anything, either. Right now, there's plenty of blame to go around.<br /><br />Fortunately for the Orioles, they play tonight, so they don't have to think about that horrible loss too long. But they also now must win the next two games. Buck Showalter will be <a href="">handing the ball to Joe Saunders</a> instead of Chris Tillman, a surprising decision. It's a do-or-die game, meaning that if Saunders struggles, he'll probably be removed from the game quickly (possibly replaced by Tillman). But Darren O'Day, Johnson, and Matusz all pitched yet again last night, so the Orioles could really use another strong start. Saunders dodged the big inning in Texas; he may not be so lucky in New York.<br /><br />O's batters get to face Phil Hughes, who's 2-2 against the Orioles this season in four starts with a 4.76 ERA. Hughes gives up his share of hits, so the O's need to capitalize on those opportunities -- something they haven't done a great job of in this series.<br /><br />If the O's do somehow win Game 4, they'll face CC Sabathia, who had a very strong outing in Game 1. That's not good, obviously, but watching that potential Game 5 would be a lot of fun.<br /><br />Now is the wrong time to abandon this team. They've done more than any other Orioles team in the past 15 years, and even if last night's defeat turns out to be one final hurdle that they couldn't overcome, they deserve plenty of praise for how far they've gotten. Moral victories don't mean anything, but we're also talking about an O's team that many predicted to lose between 95 and 100 games this season. Instead, the O's must win the next two games, in New York, to knock the Yankees out of the playoffs. It's improbable, but it's not impossible. And until this team's season is officially over, writing them off is a mistake.Matt Kremnitzer reportedly 'happy' after O's wild card winI'm almost positive I know what you were thinking after the <a href="">Orioles defeated the Rangers</a> 5-1 in the inaugural American League wild card one-game playoff: Where is Peter Angelos right now, and what is he thinking after such a thrilling victory?<br /><br />Well, apparently Angelos <a href="">watched the game at a Towson restaurant</a>, and here's what the owner had to say about Angelos's demeanor after the game:<br /><blockquote>"He's not overly ecstatic. But he was happy. And then he went home," [Carol] Troia said.</blockquote>Considering Angelos is 83 years old, that's acceptable, I guess. Then again, it would have been way better if he had ordered dessert for everyone after leading a rousing rendition of "<a href="">Orioles Magic</a>." Actually, I'm going to believe he did that instead.Matt Kremnitzer stun Rangers, face Yankees in the ALDSFor me, the biggest decision of this improbable, unexpected Orioles season happened when the O's <a href="">promoted Manny Machado</a>.<br /><br /.<br /><br />So let's skip ahead to a crucial moment in last night's win over the Rangers.

I could keep going, but all that matters is this: The O's are getting great performances at just the right time from so many different, random names, and they're doing this without a handful of their best players.<br /><br />Against all odds, the wins keep coming. About a month ago, <a href="">I looked at the O's remaining 44 games</a> and how difficult it would be for them to stay in the playoff race. Here's what they've done since:<br /><br />2-1 at Detroit<br />1-2 at Texas<br />2-0 vs. Toronto (one game rained out)<br />3-1 vs. White Sox<br />2-1 at New York<br />2-1 at Toronto<br />2-2 vs. New York<br />3-0 vs. Tampa Bay<br /><br />That's a 17-8 record, which is absurd.<br /><br / <a href="">coolstandings.com<.<br /><br /.<br /><br />But this is no time for settling for simply a winning record, as weird as that is to say. This is Birdland, where meaningful September games are played, apparently.Matt Kremnitzer without Markakis (again) will not be easyHeading down the stretch, the Orioles could not afford to lose one of their best players. Nick Markakis is certainly one of those names. And now, for the second time this season, the O's will need to battle on without Markakis, who <a href="">broke his left thumb</a> courtesy of an errant fastball from CC Sabathia last night in a 5-4 win over the Yankees and is out for the rest of the regular season.<br /><br /.<br /><br /.<br /><br /.<br /><br /.<br /><br /?Matt Kremnitzer's pitching philosophy is different, which may not be a bad thingLast week, Dan Duquette, the Orioles executive vice president of baseball operations (or, you know, their general manager), was interviewed by MASN's Steve Melewski about the <a href="">organization's pitching philosophy</a> now that he and director of pitching development Rick Peterson have been around for nearly a full season. Much of the talk centered around top prospect Dylan Bundy and the fact that the O's won't let Bundy throw his cut fastball, arguably the youngster's best pitch, this year (and possibly beyond).<br /><br />You should read the entire interview, in which, oddly enough, Duquette seems defensive of the strategy and isn't really a fan of anyone questioning what he's doing. Here are some of his comments to Melewski:<br /><blockquote>. <br /><br />."</blockquote>If Duquette had stopped right there, he may have been better off. It's at least somewhat defensible that a pitcher, especially at a young age, should be working on maintaining a strong delivery and developing fastball-changeup and curveball/slider command. But he kept going, questioning whether Mariano Rivera's cutter is actually a cutter or just "his fastball." Duquette also challenged whether the cutter was actually an efficient pitch, which seems peculiar considering several of the game's best pitchers throw cutters. Still, I was more surprised by Duquette's seemingly hostile tone, but he could be tired of people asking why Bundy hasn't been able to throw his cutter. Honestly, though, it's more than a fair question.<br /><br />On Thursday, <a href="">Melewski interviewed Peterson</a>, who should probably do the talking about this subject for the O's from now on instead of the occasionally aloof Duquette. Again, read the entire interview. Here were, to me, the two most interesting responses from Peterson:<br /><blockquote><b>Why don't you like use of the cut fastball?</b><br />." <br /><br /><b>So with younger pitchers, you discourage use of the cutter?</b><br />"Yeah, we'd like them to develop the curveball or the slider as the primary breaking ball, something that has depth to it, not something that is flat. And the cutter is a pitch that typically is thrown later on in your career, often after you've been in the big leagues several years. Be it Roy Halladay, be it Cliff Lee, those are pitches they developed later in their career, not when they were young starting pitchers coming through the minor leagues. <br />."</blockquote>So there's at least a lot of thought behind what the O's are doing. They don't want Bundy to simply get in a mode in the minors where he throws cutter after cutter to get batters out. They want him to develop his other pitches first, and then there's the possibility that they'll let him have the pitch back at some point in the majors. But by the time he's ready, Peterson doesn't seem to think he'll need the cutter anymore, or at least not until later in his career. They also don't want Bundy's fastball velocity to drop, which Peterson says is a possible result from constantly throwing cut fastballs.<br /><br />ESPN's Keith Law has been one of the most outspoken critics of how the O's have been handling Bundy, and that was before this cutter discussion started. Law believes the O's started Bundy way too low -- he thinks Bundy should have started his minor league career at least at Single-A Frederick or Double-A Bowie -- and he was not a fan of limiting Bundy to three innings at a time when he first started pitching this season. Predictably, Law is not of fan of the O's cutter philosophy either. When asked in an <a href="">ESPN chat last week</a> on what he thought of it, Law said, "I think it's nonsense, and in Bundy's case, the worst possible outcome for the kid's future." He also added this on Twitter: <br /><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Wow. Insane. RT <a href=""><s>@</s><b>andrewchelton</b></a>: <a href=""><s>@</s><b>keithlaw</b></a> Duquette "doesn't like the cutter"....great philosophy, isn't it?! <a href="" title="">masnsports.com/steve_melewski…</a><br />— keithlaw (@keithlaw) <a data-August 16, 2012</a></blockquote><script charset="utf-8" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script> So, yeah. It seems pretty bold (but harsh) for the O's to disallow Bundy from throwing the pitch entirely, but it'll be even more ridiculous if they never let him throw the pitch again (which almost seems unreasonable). I'm pretty sure Chris Tillman, who's 24, throws a cutter, and he's been more effective this season than in years past.<br /><br />Here's one thing I do know: Over the past 10-15 years, the O's have done a horrible job of both drafting and developing organizational talent, and that includes starting pitching. Let's take a look at their draft picks (pitchers only) in the first five rounds of the last 10 MLB drafts (not including this year).<br /><br />2002: Adam Loewen (1st round), Hayden Penn (5th)<br />2003: Brian Finch (2nd), Chris Ray (3rd), Bob McCrory (4th)<br />2004: Wade Townsend (1st, didn't sign), Brad Bergesen (4th)<br />2005: Garrett Olson (1st (supplemental)), Brandon Erbe (3rd), Reid Hamblet (5th)<br />2006: Pedro Beato (1st (supplemental)), Zach Britton (3rd)<br />2007: Timothy Bascom (4th), Jake Arrieta (5th)<br />2008: Brian Matusz (1st)<br />2009: Matt Hobgood (1st), Randy Henry (4th), Ashur Tolliver (5th)<br />2010: Daniel Klein (3rd)<br />2011: Dylan Bundy (1st), Mike Wright (3rd), Kyle Simon (4th), Matt Taylor (5th)<br /><br />Again, that's a lot of bad draft picks. But whatever the O's were doing then to develop those pitchers' abilities wasn't working -- at all. Some of those draft picks were/are OK relievers -- Ray, Bergesen, Beato -- but none of them is still with the O's. Britton, Arrieta, and Matusz are all still starters and have at least a shot of being effective, but you can't say the same for anyone else on that list. And all three of those guys have struggled at the major league level and have been disappointing. Hobgood and Klein haven't been able to stay healthy and are long shots to ever make it to Baltimore. And Henry (to Texas for Taylor Teagarden) and Simon (to Philadelphia for Jim Thome) are no longer in the organization. Oh, and Wright is also a reliever.<br /><br />I'm not sure if what the O's are doing will work. It seems a little radical and might be an overreaction to the results of one type of pitch. But I do know that it's refreshing to see that Duquette and particularly Peterson have some sort of well-thought-out plan, and I'm sure it's much more complex than simply not allowing their younger minor leaguers to throw cutters.<br /><br />It would be nice if the organization was better at drafting talent, period, but when they actually have good players, it's important that they grow and are eventually useful to the major league club. That hasn't happened for a while, but maybe it will now.Matt Kremnitzer. Hardy is not doing what the O's need him toJ.J. Hardy is a superb defensive shortstop, but he's consistently batted in the second spot the entire season despite putting up awful offensive numbers (.226/.273/.372). In his first season with the Orioles last year, Hardy batted .269/.310/.491, which isn't ideal for a No. 2 hitter because of the low on-base percentage, but it didn't hurt the O's much because he displayed a surprising amount of power. He posted a .222 ISO (isolated power, which measures a player's ability to hit for power/get extra-base hits) -- the best of his career -- yet only has a .146 ISO right now, which would be one of the lowest of his career.<br /><br />So what's gone wrong? Let's explore.<br /><br />Hardy's walk and strikeout numbers aren't much different. In fact, he's striking out less and walking slightly more.<br /><br />2011: 5.5 BB%, 16.2 K%<br />2012: 5.7 BB%, 15.2 K%<br /><br />His BABIP is low, though, which means he's been somewhat unlucky. He's only posted a BABIP above .300 once in his career, but this season's .240 mark is lower than his career BABIP of .274. So he's due for a few more hits to drop in, but that doesn't solely explain an OBP this low.<br /><br />He's hitting more line drives this season than last (from 16.4% to 17.5%), and his ground ball/fly ball ratio is higher than last season (from 0.93 to 1.02). His home run/fly ball ratio (9.4%) is also nowhere near last seasons's (15.7%). So he's hitting the ball somewhat harder, but overall he's hitter fewer fly balls -- and even fewer of them are leaving the ballpark.<br /><br />Hardy's plate discipline isn't the problem either. Not only is he swinging at fewer pitches outside the strike zone, but he's making more contact with those pitches as well. He's swinging at about as many pitches in the zone and overall is swinging the bat slightly less, but that doesn't explain the significant drop in his numbers either.<br /><br />So what's been the problem? Fastballs and right-handed pitching. I think it was Jim Palmer who either last night or the night before discussed how Hardy seems to be having trouble with outside fastballs and ones tailing away. Hardy's a pull hitter who likes to turn on inside pitches. He doesn't hit the ball to the opposite field often, and when he's down in the count he'll try to foul off pitches he can't handle until he gets something that he can. After destroying fastballs last season (per Fangraphs PITCHf/x pitch value data), Hardy's not hitting them much this season and is actually hitting some offspeed pitches slightly better.<br /><br />Also, here are Hardy's splits this season (and career splits in parentheses) vs. right-handed and left-handed pitching:<br /><br />vs. RHP: .215/.255/.362 (.256/.303/.413)<br />vs. LHP: .261/.328/.403 (.266/.345/.466)<br /><br />Again, Hardy's numbers are down across the board. But his numbers against lefties this season are at least serviceable for a strong defensive shortstop. Those numbers against righties, though, are truly ugly.<br /><br />It's worth remembering that last July Hardy was given a three-year, $22.25 million extension. It's nice that the O's found their short-term option at shortstop and that Hardy is so good defensively at that position, but if he's not hitting he's not helping the club nearly as much as he did in 2011. Instead of trading Hardy at the trade deadline last season when he was arguably having the best season of his career, the O's are stuck with the possibility that Hardy peaked and may only be a shell of that previous offensive force. Also, if Manny Machado stays in the majors and is on the club after spring training next season, and there's really no reason to think that he won't, then Hardy is blocking Machado's true position, or at least the position he should be playing at the big league level until he proves that he can't.<br /><br />I like Hardy and he's a steady, veteran presence who has helped the O's get where they are right now, but it's looking more and more like the O's and Andy MacPhail missed a big opportunity to sell high on Hardy a year ago and add a few pieces to fill other holes in the O's farm system.Matt Kremnitzer Orioles keep winning, which is awesomeSome.<br /><br />It's been noted that the O's have a difficult schedule in their remaining 44 games after today. Here's how those games break down:<br /><br />3 at Detroit<br />3 at Texas<br />3 vs. Toronto<br />4 vs. Chicago<br />3 at New York<br />3 at Toronto<br />4 vs. New York<br />3 vs. Tampa Bay<br />3 at Oakland<br />3 at Seattle<br />3 at Boston<br />3 vs. Toronto<br />3 vs. Boston<br />3 at Tampa Bay<br /><br /.<br /><br /.<br /><br /.<br /><br /.<br /><br /.Matt Kremnitzergiannis196 0 Report post Posted February 28, 2012 i have uploaded 3 mods and now i'm waiting for someone to approve my mods and my question is that how long does usualy a mod takes to approve can someone please answear me?

We first saw his work on this back in April when he was working mostly with acrylic. Now he’s moved on to a design that relies on hardboard which has resulted in a build that comes it at around $20 including the motors.
The design uses a dual z-axis table for the feed stage and the build stage. That is to say, as the powder is fused together by the laser the platform it is on is lowered. Next to this platform, the feed platform is raised, allowing the power to be swept onto the build stage. This setup is moving in the right direction, but we’re still waiting to see what works when it comes to adding the laser and sourcing the powder.

both hyperlinks go to the old article. :/
Thats got the info
What I could really use is something like this with a laser capable of sintering powdered ruby (corundum). They do it with diamond for heatsinks at Sandia Labs. I have a design that I want to print custom corundum bearings, but I’d need a 100k$ sintering furnace to make them!
Could this be adapted with a superlaser to sinter corundum? I’m aware of the stress impartation this method would incur on the structure as a whole. It’s experimental.
hi folks,
neat to see this up here! the direct link is:
the real innovation in this part of the project is that, keeping with the idea of trying to make 3D printers accessible and affordable, this aspect of the project designs and constructs dual z-axis tables for only around $6 in parts (and less than $20, with the motors), and replaces a lot of the traditional “vitamins” (or non-reprappable parts) that you have to purchase or can’t easily construct using rapid prototyping methods with ones that you can (and this idea is embodied in this new design’s use of a captive nut and bolt in a laser-cut gear system as the lead screw mechanism).
the design files are open source, and available on thingiverse (linked through in the reprap builders article)
happy reading! :)
random but pertinent fact i learned about lasers last week. I was talking to an optics guy with a PhD in Physics last week about the new wickedlasers 1W handheld blue laser, and also asking about military laser technologies, which use infrared. He mentioned that in many ways, the blue laser is more dangerous. This is because, being visible light, the eye has a tendency to automatically notice it, focus on it, and track it. That means that the eye will focus the beam in the most destructive way. He also mentioned that because of the way our foveal system works, your eye will keep darting around to gather the whole scene, and in the process it will keep moving that focused blue laser all around destroying everything in the process.
The military uses infrared lasers because of their power and ability to penetrate the atmosphere, and the nice thing is that since your eye doesn’t focus on it, the interior of your eye stays relatively undamaged. It will burn the surface of your eye much like a sunburn, which is still bad but seems to be a lot better. You’re also more likely to turn away from that, whereas we have evolved to turn towards and focus on visible lights.
So keep that in mind when lasering! I mostly bring that up, because my first thought was that the new blue laser would be great for this, until i realized that the reflected light would be way more dangerous than infrared!
Its probably best to use an infrared laser coupled with a low power visible laser, though again that would draw your eye towards reflections. High powered lasers are just dangerous no matter how you use them!
-Taylor
Weird how I see wooden constructions with electronics everywhere lately, it’s back to the beginning it seems.
@taylor that sounds a bit odd since if the military use a laser it will be pointing at their focus of attention obviously, and often looked at through lenses that make the area viewed even smaller.
And I think they use IR to not be noticed, but they use green too, in fact they used green lasers to warn cars to stop approaching when a untrusted vehicle is heading towards checkpoints in iraq, and I assume afghanistan and such too.
I guess my question would be: How do you get a 1 Watt laser legitimately when it anything other than 5MW or FDA approved lasers are not approved for import? Can you get an application from the government to import these things?
Is it me or does this kind of remind you of a wooden erector set?
@Whatnot Wood (or wood product) are some of the better materials a laser cutter will cut. Especially for building a structure. Acrylic shatters and cracks too much.
@Taylor Alexander: I don’t think anyone that has at least a wee bit of sense would operate a laser like that without protection. Personally I would run it in an enclosure and view it via a camera but then again I’m seriously paranoid when it comes to lasers.
@Whatnot
Sorry, I meant to clarify – I meant the new high powered laser weapons for destroying missiles that are in the 10-100KW range. Those don’t need to be visible, just powerful. I’m sure the military uses low powered visible ones for all kinds of things too.
@Chuckt
Anything greater than 5mW has to have specific safety features, that’s the only requirement. Plenty of chinese models don’t have those features, so they get confiscated by customs, but as long as a laser has those safety features, there is no limits on the power of a laser a person may own.
@sneakypoo
Well, that’s the scary thing… WickedLasers just started selling a 1W blue laser pointer for $200… previously that price would only buy you 20mW, so people had to be careful, but mostly just with direct exposure or reflections off shiny things. With the advent of low cost 1W lasers, more people need to be made aware of the severe damage these things can cause, because even a reflection off a while wall can blind you! Some kid might buy one because its “cool”, but at these power levels, they’re insanely dangerous.
Sadly, I expect that the 1W laser pointer will result in at least 20 dumb kids getting blinded or blinding others before some sort of regulation is put into effect. These are more dangerous than handguns.
The new laser at WickedLasers is not likely to be 1 watt. Most of the lasers that they sell are way overpriced and underspec. They haven’t even finished research and development yet! I have a 50mW (non-fda-approved) that I got for $20 online. In fact, you can build a >1W laser easily for $100 with those new diodes from that laser projector.
In response to Taylor Alexander, for $200 you could buy a 200mW+ laser before and wickedlasers’ new blue is probably only going to be 500mW. These are not more dangerous than handguns, but they should require a license. Good thing WickedLasers sends you a free pair of protective glasses!
Oh, and I built my first 200mW bluray laser at 16 for $150 so it’s not that difficult or expensive.
Go to laserpointerforums.com if you want to join in the discussion. There are some really intelligent people there.
More dangerous than handguns you say?
Now I want one even more so I can build laser weapons to defend my home, errrr…hunt…with.
A lower powered laser pointer could still be used as a sighting system until you want to use the more powerful one.
…for hunting…
( i just posted a video of the first test of this dual z-stage: )
Ok who ever said that a visable laser is more dangerous than an IR laser is plain wrong. You had to have misunderstood your optics friend. The danger of lasers can be related to exposer time and Lens transmisivity. UV lasers on one end of the spectrum will not transmit through your lens but will photo-ablate it (read about Lasik). Visable lasers (somewhat in the middle of the spectrum) are just that, visable, the first rule a laser guy will ever tell you in the safety brief is “if you see a flash in one eye, don’t try to see it again with the other eye”. Typically one would see the flash and turn away. Your body also has a natural blink response to these types of events (ever have a flash light fhashed in your face?). Thus minamizing exposure to a small limited area. IR lasers on the other hand are again invisable (like UV lasers) but even worse is the fact that the Lens of your eye not only will transmit the IR light but will focus it on your retina. And this is the worst part, since it’s invisable there will be NO BLINK response meaning, you won’t see a flash if your lucky you’ll notice your vision getting dimmer. Either way Perm damage without you noticing.
The advantage of IR lasers is that you can use safety glasses that are clear in the visible spectrum, but opaque to IR light.
Cola (the beverage) works the opposite way – black in the visible spectrum, but clear to IR.Donna Taylor

- 3 May 2014
- From the section Gloucestershire
An ornate golden crown that will go onto the coffin of Richard III when he is re-buried is being displayed at Tewkesbury Abbey.
The crown was commissioned and paid for by the historian Dr John Ashdown-Hill who helped identify the king's remains.
Amanda Thomas from Tewkesbury Abbey said: "It's gold with sapphires, diamonds, garnets, studded with jewels, a lovely piece."
Dr Ashdown-Hill will also be giving a talk about his work at the Abbey later.
The remains of the king were found buried in a Leicester car park, with DNA tests used to confirm the identity.<< -- 3 -- Kelly Ferjutz SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE

Published: February 18, 2000
To the Editor:
Linking candidates for the Republican presidential nomination to the Confederate flag atop South Carolina's Capitol is not very salutary (Editorial Observer, Feb. 15). As Brent Staples notes, that standard first unfurled in 1962 during the Kennedy years and waves aloft four decades later.
Why flagellate the current Republican hopefuls, none of whom reside in South Carolina, for a banner that has already survived the Kennedy, Johnson, Carter and Clinton administrations?
To suggest that the G.O.P. candidates have ''identified their party yet again with forces that have poisoned our national politics for more than 100 years'' is a bit rash given that those ''forces'' include segregationists like George Wallace, Lester Maddox and Orval Faubus, Democrats all.

COLUMBIA, Ky. — University of Rio Grande’s Luiz Filho and Campbellsville University’s Max Malachiyev are the Mid-South Conference Men’s Soccer Players of the Week, conference officials announced on Monday.
The weekly honor is Malachiyev’s second this season and third of his career. Filho earns his first conference weekly award of his career.
Filho posted back-to-back hat tricks in two RedStorm wins to earn Mid-South Offensive Men’s Soccer Player of the Week.
The Sao Paulo, Brazil, sophomore forward, recorded his first career three-goal game in a 6-0 win over Mid-South foe Bluefield College on Wednesday. Filho duplicated his Bluefield performance on Sunday with three more goals in the RedStorm’s 6-0 win over Point Park (Pa.) University.
With his six-goal week, Filho moves into a tie for second in the conference with nine goals and fourth in the MSC with 19 points. He ranks 12th in goals and 25th in points this season in the NAIA.
No. 3-ranked Rio Grande improves to 7-1-1 overall and 2-0-1 in the Mid-South.
Malachiyev allowed just one goal while stopping seven shots in a pair of Campbellsville wins last week to earn Mid-South Defensive Men’s Soccer Player of the Week.
The Moscow, Russia, sophomore goalkeeper, recorded a save in the Tigers’ 3-1 win at Georgetown College on Wednesday. Malachiyev followed with his second shutout of the season in a 2-0 win over Bluefield on Saturday.
Malachiyev ranks third in the Mid-South with a 1.15 goals against average. His 31 saves ranks sixth in the conference.
With last week’s wins, Campbellsville improves to 9-1 overall and 3-1 in the MSC.
University of Rio Grande junior Brittany Piccone is the Mid-South Conference Women’s Cross Country Runner of the Week, conference officials announced on Monday.
The weekly honor is Piccone’s first of the season.
The Crooksville, Ohio, native earned a runner-up finish on Saturday in the 41-woman Rio Grande/Patty Forgey Invitational.
Piccone ran the 5,000-meter course in 20 minutes and 44 seconds - 10 seconds off the winning time. Her time helped the RedStorm to a third-place team finish.
Rio Grande returns to action on Friday at the All-Ohio Championship hosted by Cedarville University.Foreclosure aid company subject of numerous complaints
Don and Andrea Gaines thought they were getting some legal muscle in their fight to hold onto their home when they retained the services of Home Legal Source.
What they got, instead, was a company that has generated an average of nearly two complaints a month since its inception and, as a result, received the lowest rating possible from the Better Business Bureau.
“We would strongly discourage customers from using this company,” said Sheryl Bilbrey, chief executive officer of the BBB in San Diego and Imperial counties in Southern California.
That warning came too late for the Gaineses, who appear to be out of their home as a result of a foreclosure and the $2,000 they gave Home Legal Source for help that never came.
“I feel like we’ve been scammed,” said Andrea Gaines, who turned to Home Legal Source after talking to a friend and fellow Clifton resident who also was trying to fend off foreclosure on her home.
Incorporated in October 2008, Home Legal Source is a corporation that asserts its mission is to “provide competent legal assistance to families in the growth and preservation of their assets.”
But a quick Internet search reveals a litany of complaints about the company, ranging from refusing to refund clients’ money to failing to return phone calls and e-mails.
The BBB in San Diego and Imperial counties has received 46 complaints about Home Legal Source in less than two years. Of those, 14 were resolved, two were unresolved, and seven were administratively closed by the BBB. What stands out most to Bilbrey, though, is the 23 complaints to which the company never responded. That’s the biggest factor in explaining why Home Legal Source received an F rating from the BBB.
“That’s a customer-service failure,” Bilbrey said of the company’s failure to respond to half of the complaints lodged against it. “That’s why they’re getting the F rating they are. We take that very seriously.”
Bilbrey said 17 different criteria factor into rating a business, including how long it has been in existence, whether it has proper licensing and the volume of complaints filed against it.
The BBB’s website indicates there are eight other similarly sized real- estate-attorney firms in the region where Home Legal Source operates. Only one other company had between 26 and 99 complaints filed against it in the past three years. Six companies were the subject of between zero and four complaints.
Bilbrey said 90 percent of the roughly 2,000 complaints her office processes each month are resolved informally. The balance go through an arbitrator, and the businesses that are accredited are required to respond to and resolve those complaints. Failure to do so results in the BBB revoking their accreditation, she said.
Home Legal Source is not accredited by the BBB.Eastern Kentucky vs Chattanooga Final: 74-63 - Recap
Eastern Kentucky grabbed a 74-63 win over Chattanooga on Tuesday, behind a 19-point effort from Glenn Cosey at Paul S. McBrayer Arena.
The game was a push (tie) for betting purposes as the final score was identical to the 11 number at most sportsbooks.
Corey Walden had 16 points for Eastern Kentucky and Marcus Lewis chipped in with 13 points. Glenn Cosey had 3 assists for them, while Tarius Johnson was the team's top rebounder, grabbing 5 boards.
Chattanooga got 23 points from Z. Mason in a losing cause and another 12 points from Martynas Bareika. Z. Mason contributed 3 assists for them, while Z. Mason had 12 rebounds.
Eastern Kentucky led at halftime, 42-36.
The rebound battle favored Chattanooga as they grabbed 35 boards, while Eastern Kentucky only had 25.A little less than a week later it arrived in the mail. It was packed very welly and arrived in excellent condition. I quickly set it up and fired up the included edutainment game Race the Clock. Thanks to a little research I found out that the Memorex VIS could also use a wired controller that plugged into the AUX port on the back of the system. It uses the same plug as a PS/2 Mouse or Keyboard because it actually can use those in lieu of the wired controller. I'm not sure if you can use a mouse or keyboard with every game but you can certainly use a Mouse with Race the Clock.
I at first tried to use the Wireless controller which I found to be very laggy and painful to use. So I looked around the house for an old mouse, most of the ones I have are optical USB mice, and fired the game up with the mouse plugged in. The game controlled much faster and much more smoothly. Race the Clock is a memory card flipping game where you match two cards and clear a board to reveal a picture. The cards themselves reveal a small video clip of an action. For example you click a card and it shows a girl brushing her hair and you hear the word "brush!" Then you click around and match up pairs until you get some silly picture.
There are a few difficulty levels the higher difficulty being a larger grid with more cards to flip. The game is awful. Each card takes about four seconds for the video to load and they are four painfully long seconds, perhaps the four longest seconds of your life. I played the first game option which was a grid of 3 rows of 4 and the clock I was racing started at 8:59. It didn't take very long to complete the puzzle and would have taken half the time if the load times for each card wasn't so unbearable.
The next thing I tested was it's CD playback capability. Again the wireless controller was slow and laggy so I used the mouse which again made everything better. It's a very bare bones CD player but back then anything that played CDs was pretty fancy and expensive. I'd like to try the game and CD player out using a keyboard instead of the mouse and see how that goes. Like I said I'm not sure if you can swap controllers like that or if it differs from game to game. There really isn't a lot of information out there regarding the Memorex VIS beyond a few notes and tidbits.
On the front of the system there's a little plastic flap that reveals an expansion slot and two jacks one for a microphone and the other for a pair of headphones. I'm not sure what the early to mid 90's were like for older people but I really don't remember karaoke being that huge but you'd think it was the most popular activity in the land because every CD based console from that time supported Karaoke.

Looks like a piece of shit... money spent shittyly....
Are we going to see some videos of it in action?
Yeah I'll do a video on Race the Clock and any other games I happen across.
My parents just gave me a VIS when I went to see them at Thanksgiving. She said she was just about to give it to good will. My uncle still have theirs too. It was a $99 at radio shack & came with 32 games/videos for it, 2 wireless controllers and a memory card "SAVE-IT. They all are point and click games.
I only used it as a CD player. The games were so horrible & I had no interest in aerobic work out videos.
Jackup460
Let's see some video of that shit!
I never heard of that afore
Theres only 2 games that I can say are *decent* (mainly because they are on other BETTER systems) and those two are: Links - The Challenge of Golf, and Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective
nice find man! There isn't a lot of info on this system online. Seems likes the step-brother of the CD-i ... not a good thing HAHA. Sherlock Holmes looks fun.
I have my Vis from when I was a kid. I loved it. I mean ill admit now its pretty lame with the games, but back then it was great.
I don't play anymore, but I must say my favorite game has to be The Secrets of Hosea Freeman.
Games for this system are impossible to find. Anybody have any that they would like to sell?

Many of us were mesmerized by Ryan Flynn’s stop motion demolition video, showing the process of demolishing a Cabrini-Green building that sits across the street from him.
Interestingly enough, some New York and Chicago artists had a similar idea, only much more appetizing. Artists Eliza, Eve and Bowie created an “edible ghetto” – housing projects made out of food and then allowed their audience to slowly nibble away at the development one evening.
Take a look:
I think it’s really interesting to watch how the destruction starts slowly. When it’s all one piece, people are hesitant to take a bite. But after the pieces start coming off, people start to chow down. Why not take a piece of something that’s already falling apart?
The artists ask some great questions about the “consumption” of a neighborhood, land and space.
It also reminded me of some former Chicago public housing towers that have already been “eaten,” – the former ABLA homes on the near West side. Take a look:

Now that’s freeloading at a new level, it moves fast but there are some big bellies, guy with the 1000 dollar digital camera gets at least seconds, think they knew the camera was there? Your thoughts reinforce the “broken window theory”, if a broken window goes unfixed, look out, there goes the neighborhood. My city has streets in the middle of bad, that make you think wow, did I just get transported somewhere else? They look like a suburb, than the next street is falling down, people do overcome amazing things.

The headline on top of Michael P. Haynes' Voice of the Day (Feb. 3), "Ray's work for poor isn't Christian," was clearly intended, and does indeed convey, the false implication that Haynes and the Greene County Baptist Association believe that Christianity does not include helping the poor.
Most people will look no further than that headline and the photograph of the full-bearded white man, and maybe at the bottom where it says Greene County Baptist Association, and conclude (wrongly) that this man, representing this association, believes that helping the poor "isn't Christian."
In fact, Haynes states, "I agree with Ray that service to the poor is imperative," and that "Ray does wonderful work in serving the poor in our community."
However, he also states that his issues with Ray are "how he defines (or doesn't define) his faith and service."
Ray has received much support in letters to the editor, including a To the Point from Sil Leonard ("Sermons reflect Jesus," Feb. 3), who states, "judging by his sermons, he is doing his best to follow the teachings of Jesus of Nazareth."
I don't know which of the teachings of Jesus of Nazareth Ray is doing his best to follow, but it doesn't seem to be that well-known part of the Sermon on the Mount, namely Matthew 6:1-4, in which Jesus tells us not to blow a horn in the streets when you are giving to the poor so as to make sure everybody sees you doing it, but instead to give to the poor in secret so that nobody sees you doing it.
There are many good Christians who do just this, including the Well of Life at 418 S. Kimbrough Ave.
Those who blow their own horn about it, Jesus calls them "hypocrites" (Matthew 6:2).ISS029-E-039234 (4 Nov. 2011) --- Robonaut 2 -- the first dexterous humanoid robot in space -- is pictured in the Destiny laboratory of the International Space Station.

At least he's a Jag fan. Oh, and I went to a basketball game with him once and he's a knowledgable guy at that. Knows the Jaguars history pretty good. Nice guy too.
Folks, it could be worse; it could be Hacker and his endless stories of playing 3 downs of high school football, his passion for playing with dolls, what he ate for dinner, etc. $23.00 a month for XM Radio is worth EVERY penny.
I for one think the decision was a bad one. I don't necessarily want a homer calling the games but I believe it is imperative that they be a true Jaguar fan. A steelers fan is blasphemy! Bad bad bad move. The Jaguars distain for the Steelers hasn't gone anywhere, even though they are no longer division rivalries. What's up Jags?
Too bad to hear this. I always enjoyed listening to Sexton and am sorry he won't be doing the Jags games anymore. Guess I'll turn the volume up on the TV again. Will miss him at the mike.
I hope Rick on the sideline doesn't ramble about Flamus Jamus and the noles.Cinema

Log in to commentand has been misrepresented by Senator Olympia Snowe for many years.
Rick Santorum took his campaign to Puerto Rico yesterday and in a move calculated to lose the upcoming Sunday caucuses went for broke, telling Puerto Ricans who have a November referendum scheduled on statehood and a Governor who supports both statehood and Mitt Romney that they should make English their official language as a statehood condition according to Reuters:
Santorum said he did not support a state in which English was not the primary language.Of course this ignores the fact that the United States does not have an official language and there are no "compliance" provisions for English. Some states in xenophobic zeal have passed laws making English an official language. Puerto Rico does already have English and Spanish as its official languages.
."
The thrust of Santorum's remarks would appear to be to play to his right wing base back on the mainland if this was a purposefully calculated move. However that is not Rick's usual English approach since he usually spouts off in English without much English forethought whatsoever. This is one more reason that in a Fox poll of potential Latino voters President Obama is at 69% and Rick Santorum is at 14% along with all his GOP rivals.
Currently 27 out of 50 states have passed laws making English the official language. In 1978 Native Hawaiian was added as the second official state language of Hawaii in addition to English:
"The Hawaiian language is the native language of Hawaii and may be used on all emblems and symbols representative of the State, its departments, agencies and political subdivisions."
One further wonders that since Santorum sees Puerto Rico's establishment of two official languages as a barrier to statehood, if in his rigid ideological approach to most things, that he believes Hawaii ought to be stripped of statehood. Doing so of course might play well to the GOP/tea base, killing three birds with one stone. It would finally make President Obama a foreigner, remove a reliable Democratic piece of the Electoral College, and increase the influence of the right wing English-only language purists.
Far fetched? So is Rick Santorum as President. Adiós Rick!
Comment PreferencesThere was reason to celebrate Tuesday for the Huntington Beach High softball team: for the first time since 1996, the program has a Sunset League championship.
Well, a portion of it, anyway.
Huntington clinched a tie for its first league title in 18 years by emerging with a 7-6 victory over Edison in a wild, see-saw battle at Huntington that included seven lead changes. Anna Kufta's double scored Alyssa Horeczko and Kristina Inouye both who singled to start the bottom of the seventh.
Horeczko had two hits and the Orange County leader in stolen bases increased her number to 31 with a stolen base. The sophomore also pitched 2/3 of an inning without allowing a run, and got the win. Inouye had two hits and Ivy Davis had two hits including a two-run double and two RBIs.
Oilers Coach Jeff Forsberg said that Huntington, now at 20-4 with one regular season game to play, possesses the best season record in program history.
The Oilers are 8-1 in league heading into Thursday's regular-season finale, and hold a one-game edge on second-place Marina.
Edison had scored three runs in the top of the seventh to take a 5-4 lead before Huntington's final rally.
"We handled the stress well tonight," Forsberg said. "Losing a heartbreaker to Marina last week would knock a team down but this team is unlike any other. We were down again after being up but we had the right game competitors up in the seventh [inning] with Horeczko, Inouye and Kufta. All three delivered as they have done all year.
"Getting a share of a league title is not only awesome for our current players and staff but all the players in the past that have helped shape the team. I applaud all of them. But we know that we have more work and challenges ahead. We hope to continue to ride this wave out as far as it goes."
Marina ran its win streak to six games Tuesday by scoring a 6-2 win at Fountain Valley. Keala Cordeiro went two for three with a double, Desiree Hagberg doubled twice, Alyssa Sojka went two four three, and Tera Blanco doubled for the Vikings, the sixth-ranked team in CIF Southern Section Division 1 who are 21-6 overall and 7-2 in league.
Blanco also threw a complete game, allowing five hits and two walks while striking out six in running her record to 20-4.
In a key, previous Sunset game, Marina prevented Huntington from clinching the Sunset title May 8 by scoring four runs in the top of the sixth inning to overcome a one-run deficit and pull out a 5-2 road win. Cordeiro and Ryan King both went two for three and Emma Walker doubled for the Vikings. Blanco threw a five-hitter in another complete-game victory.
Alyssa Horeczko and Kristina Inouye both went two for three for Huntington.
Sunset League teams complete regular-season play Thursday. Games at 3:15 p.m. include Huntington at Los Alamitos, Newport Harbor at Marina and Fountain Valley at Edison.

•Ocean View shut out consecutive Golden West League opponents including an 8-0 victory Monday over visiting Westminster. Billi Derleth pitched a complete-game shutout allowing only three hits with six strikeouts to notch win No. 11 on the season.
The Seahawks, the No. 7 team in CIF Southern Section Division 4, pounded out 14 hits led by Tobi Salzman and Jade Bustamonte with three hits apiece. Emily Long, Anika Ortiz and Madison Garcia each had two hits.
Ocean View Coach Mike McLaughlan said seniors Salzman, Long and Madison Garcia, "went out in style" in their final regular-season home game by combining for seven hits and four RBIs.
The Seahawks, second to Loara in the GWL standings, improved to 6-3 in league and 18-6 overall.
Derleth allowed only one hit and Bustamonte had two hits and drove in three runs in Ocean View's previous outing, a 3-0 home win over Segerstrom Friday.
The Seahawks closed out their regular season Wednesday at Orange. The result from their league game wasn't available at press time.
The CIF Southern Section softball playoff pairings will be released Saturday. Division wild-card games are at 3:15 p.m. Monday, and first-round games are at 3:15 p.m. Tuesday.

Streaking Lizards Bounce Rochester from MLL Playoff Race
from press releases
HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. - Long Island opened on a 9-0 run and ended Rochester’s playoff hopes with a 15-7 victory over the Rattlers on Thursday night at Hofstra University. Both teams entered the game on two game winning streaks, but hat tricks from Matt Danowski and Stephen Peyser were more than enough for Lizards.
Peyser tied a Major League Lacrosse single-game record by scoring three two-point goals and added an assist. He is the seventh player in MLL history to record three two-point goals in a game and the first player to accomplish the feat since Danowski did against Chicago on July 10, 2010.
Long Island opened the scoring on a goal by Danowski 5:47 into
the first quarter. Less than a minute later. Goettelmann scored his second goal of the game 1:31 into the second quarter and Grant opened his scoring account about four minutes later to finish the Lizards opening run.
Grant Catalino finally opened the scoring for Rochester on a two Striebel for his second goal of the quarter.
The Lizards put an end to the Rattlers five to zero run when Rochester defensive middie Dan Groot took a one minute penalty for a high hit. Peyser capitalized on the power play with a two-point goal from Grant with 2:03 left in the third quarter. Long Island led 11 to 6 at the end of the third quarter.
Berger opened the scoring in the fourth quarter with his second goal of the game to extend the Lizards lead to 12 to 6 1:12 in. Matt Danowski completed his hat trick with 7:38 left in the game to extend the Lizards lead to 13-6.
Rattlers star Ned Crotty ended the Lizards four to zero run with a spectacular airborne goal less than a minute later. It was Crotty’s 22nd goal on the 2011 season.
Peyser added some insurance for the Lizards by completing his hat trick with a two point marker with just 3:18 left in the game to extend Long Island’s 15-7 lead over the Rattlers.
The Lizards have won three straight games, and are now 5-5.. 6 against the Chesapeake Bayhawks. The Rattlers will be raffling off their game worn jerseys with the proceeds going to Hillside Charity. For tickets call 585.454.5425 or visit ticketmaster.com.MACROSCOPE

According to the late media guru Marshall McLuhan, the nature and significance of a tool is usually not truly understood, even by the inventor, until it has been used for some period of time. Then, and only then, can it be known what the tool has become, therefore what it is. This basic principle has applied at least from the invention of the printing press and electricity to the telephone and airplane.
This principle of retroactive discovery also applies to the panoply of electronic tools of communication that are now engulfing the recognized institutions of society, from the military and academia, where they got their start, to small business and large industry as well as private individuals. E-mail and the Internet form the core of this tool chest, but there is no shortage of related paraphernalia, including systems that convert speech to print and vice versa.
As a result of this propagation, scientists—the universally acknowledged masters of experimental manipulation—are now, themselves, participants in one of the grandest experiments of all time. In this experiment, the scientists are coming together to share ideas and develop working relationships as they always have, but the meeting place is totally different. It is, increasingly, not even a place so much as a corridor—the so-called information superhighway—in which informational traffic flows back and forth at incredibly rapid rates. But unlike all the other venues of spontaneous human expressivity that have predominated from the beginning of time, this one is remarkably still.
The ease and speed of our new message-making systems are, of course, nothing to sneeze at. One can now peruse journal articles on-line, storing and printing the most interesting ones for later use. Increasingly, one can submit "manuscripts" electronically; reviews can be obtained and forwarded to the editor and author the same way. There are also science forums in which researchers can meet in a quasi-public area of cyberspace to discuss and debate issues of mutual interest. Individual scientists are able to easily locate each other and strike up, or continue, written communications about matters of common concern. These and a host of other applications of electronic communication are greatly enhancing the processes of science and, it may be assumed, hastening if not improving the products of that activity.
Efficiency of transmission aside, there are reasons to be concerned about aspects of electronic communication, at least if it takes the place of the social processes and procedures that have served science so well over the decades and centuries. These include two critical elements in science, collaborating and conven(skip this header)

THUNDER BAY – If you like tasty Chinese food, here is a recipe that is sure to please. If you are in Calgary, Ginger Beef is a Chinese staple as much as Bon Bons are here in Thunder Bay. This is a dish famous first in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, and then all Alberta, and now in your home!
In Calgary, the debate rages on over where the best Ginger Fried Beef cann be found. I have two favourites. One is Pang Pangs deep in the south of the city, the other is from Golden Chopsticks on the southwest of the city. However for Calgarians who take their Ginger Beef seriously, my choices would likely start an argument.
Ginger beef is the ultimate comfort food. This famous dish, consisting of marinated beef deep-fried in batter and coated with a sweet hot sauce is a staple of Alberta Chinese restaurants. In winter it helps warm you up, on hot summer nights it is a spicy dish that will cool you down.
You can make your Ginger Beef as hot and spicy, or as sweet as you like. All it takes is a little practice.
Ingredients
- 1 Pound Flank Steak
- One Carrot
- Three or more Hot Chili Peppers
- (at least) 2 Tablespooms Fresh Ginger, Minced
- 2 Cloves Garlic, Minced
- 1 Teaspoon Sesame Oil
Marinade
- 2 Tablespoons Dark Soy Sauce
- One Tablespoom Cooking Wine
- 1 Teaspoon Sugar
- 2 Tablespoons Ginger Juice
- 2 Cloves Garlic, Minced
- 1 Teaspoon Sesame Oil
Batter
- 1 Egg
- One Quarter Cup Water
- One Quarter Cup Flour
- One Quarter Cup Corn Starch
- 1 tablespoon hot chili oil (optional)
Sauce
- 1 tablespoon hot chili oil (optional)
- 1 tablespoon red wine
- 2 tablespoons light soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon vinegar
- 7 tablespoons of honey
- 1/2 teaspoon sesame oil
- 2 tablespoons water
- chili oil or chili powder to taste
4 to 5 cups oil for deep-frying
Directions:
Cut beef into long strips, cutting along the grain. (The meat is easier to cut if it is partially frozen). As you get more experienced, you can decide if you like really crispy Ginger Beef, in which case you make thinner strips. If you like a chewier Ginger Beef you make the strips thicker.
To make ginger juice for marinade, peel and grate ginger. Squeeze out juice. Mix four marinade ingredients. Add to beef and marinate for at least 30 minutes.
Begin preparing vegetables. Cut carrots, celery, and peppers into thin strips. Mince garlic. For ginger, use the leftover minced ginger from the preparation of ginger juice.
Mix the sauce ingredients. Set aside.
Beat the egg white and add water. Add flour and cornstarch. Mix the batter thoroughly. Pour the batter into the marinated meat.
Heat wok. When heated, add. To make your Ginger Beef a little spicier, add more chili peppers.October 3, 2013
Obamacare 'sticker shock' being reported
Via KING TV in Seattle, not exactly a red state television outlet, comes news of "sticker shock" on the part of Washington State folks signing up for Obamacare. The station cites Eric Levy, whose existing health insurance plan was too costly, he felt: So he jumped online to the Washington Health Benefit Exchange and the sticker shock for a comparable plan was even worse. "It's another $500 a month that you have to think about how you're going to pay for," said Levy. What's worse is paying for certain coverage he doesn't need. "The real thing that jumped out at me is all of a sudden I'm required to have maternity coverage," he said. As the fiasco of Obamacare technical glitches subsides and more people are actually able to access the plans available to them, there are going to be a lot of unhappy campers, not least among the young adult demographic which so strongly supported Obama in his two presidential elections. Advertisers know that the young adult demographic is more...(Read Full Post)2003-12-11 / Front Page

Reblogged this on Stoning Demons and commented:. :)Angel is stunned as Connor falls through the portal from the hell dimension. His son is now a teenager and, thanks to Holtz, he hates Angel. While Angel tries to get through to Connor, Lilah shows up at Wesley's apartment with an interesting proposition... Written by katierose295
Before i say anything, let me say two points:
I don't want to incorporate, here, what we all know will happen, but, stick specifically to what is known as of THIS pointing the series.
I also want to reflect on my this episode A NEW WORLD, by commenting on the first user review I saw: katierose295.
As I write this, it's now '12 - almost 5 years after she wrote her review. While the series has been off the air (new episodes) for almost a decade, ANGEL still lives on, in perpetuity on TNT (which is how I initially got hooked in the first place).
As ANGEL is shown in a never-ending loop, you develop insight as to when a particular season, story-arc, etc. will begin.
In A NEW WORLD, we see for the first time, a (physically - definitely not emotionally) mature Connor, Angel's son, for those who might not know.
With this episodes intro, we're given a quick back-story, and, then, we're met with a animal-skin covered (or, as the drug dealer, Tyke says, a 'chamois suit') Connor - whose escaped from the hell-dimension Quor'Toth.
I mentioned katierose295, and, now, I'll tell why I mentioned her:
She makes it quite clear that she dislikes Connor above all other characters in the BuffyVerse.
She explains that, amongst her reasons for disliking him, are, he's 'uninteresting,mug sympathetic, and annoying.'
I, too - have similar feelings about Connor (as do many others), but, katierose295's comments being the first I saw, they stuck out.
And, I thought about what she said.
The thing is, I think the character, Connor is SUPPOSED to be a 'sullen teenager,' pushed to extreme characterisation.
People can argue whether or not he's justified in his beliefs (basically, his father 'abandoned' him, and, didn't 'do anything' to get him back. Personally, I think Angel did all that he COULD do), but, as the character Connor is of main-focus, in this season, he brings a lot of controversy to this season.
A NEW WORLD's major story line, is a 'fish-out-of-water' story, about Connor.
After his violent introduction to Team Angel (I live their version of 'bullet-time.' What would YOU call it - 'arrow-time?'), Connnor heads into an unknown world; Los Angeles.
His first encounter is with a conflict, between a drug user, named Sunny, and her drug dealer, Tyke.
From Connor's unknowing point-of-view, he sees a woman in distress, and acts accordingly.
Sunny brings Connor into her home - an abandoned hotel, where she shoots up, explaining to Connor, that she's 'sick,' and the dope's her 'medicine.'
After Sunny OD's, Connor - from the look on his face - feels abandoned, again.
His first introduction to our 'civilised' world, immediately appears to him, just as dangerous, as the dimension he's just escaped from.
I don't want to give a blow-by-blow story-line, but, it's from this 'damaged' first introduction, that Connor's views are shaped.
Yes, he's a. VERY damaged young man, who has not had any stabilised guidance in his life. He's been raised by a man, who's Angel(us)'s sworn enemy, and, has been thrust into something very alien, to him.
As I initially said, how katierose295 dislikes Connor (I don't mean to pick on you!), I understand what Mr. Wheaton wanted to do, but, I think the Connor character's introduction, and subsequent hatred could've been handled better.
Given Mr. Whedon's usual writing abilities, I come down harder, on him. He should've been able to handle Connor with more finesse.
But, given what we are, this is a story-arc that will have strong importance, throughout this season.
I still give this episode a '7,' because overall, the writing is heads-over-heels far better than on most series.
Still, it's hard for me - as it apparently is for others - to separate Vincent Katheiser's performance AS Connor, from the actor himself.This article is an open-access article distributed under the terms and conditions of the Creative Commons Attribution license ().
Atmospheric dispersion calculations are made using the HYSPLIT Particle Dispersion Model for studying the transport and dispersion of air-borne releases from point elevated sources in the Mississippi Gulf coastal region. Simulations are performed separately with three meteorological data sets having different spatial and temporal resolution for a typical summer period in 1–3 June 2006 representing a weak synoptic condition. The first two data are the NCEP global and regional analyses (FNL, EDAS) while the third is a meso-scale simulation generated using the Weather Research and Forecasting model with nested domains at a fine resolution of 4 km. The meso-scale model results show significant temporal and spatial variations in the meteorological fields as a result of the combined influences of the land-sea breeze circulation, the large scale flow field and diurnal alteration in the mixing depth across the coast. The model predicted SO2 concentrations showed that the trajectory and the concentration distribution varied in the three cases of input data. While calculations with FNL data show an overall higher correlation, there is a significant positive bias during daytime and negative bias during night time. Calculations with EDAS fields are significantly below the observations during both daytime and night time though plume behavior follows the coastal circulation. The diurnal plume behavior and its distribution are better simulated using the mesoscale WRF meteorological fields in the coastal environment suggesting its suitability for pollution dispersion impact assessment in the local scale. Results of different cases of simulation, comparison with observations, correlation and bias in each case are presented.
Increasing urbanization, industrial growth and population expansion in coastal areas necessitates accurate air pollution dispersion estimates. A number of regional-scale meteorological conditions and prevailing winds influence the pollutant trajectories and ground level concentrations. Coastal regions are particularly interesting as topographic variations and land-sea interface govern the local flow. Pollutant plumes in the coastal zones are influenced by development of meso-scale sea breeze circulations as a result of differential heating of the land and water surfaces [
Southern Mississippi (MS) has densely populated urban regions at Biloxi, Gulfport, Harrison located along the Gulf Coast. Several industries situated along the MS coast emit elevated releases. Considerable meso-scale forcing exists in the Mississippi Gulf coast due to differential temperatures across the coast, variability in the land use and complex topography. This area, located to the east of Louisiana complex coastline (
Since the interest here is to find the differences that arise in the concentration patterns in the three different cases of input data, simulations are compared to ground-level air concentrations to assess the relative performance of each of the meteorological data sets. The description of different meteorological data sets used for the study is given in Section 2, the dispersion model is described in Section 3 and the intercomparison of dispersion calculations is given in Section 4.
The modeling period was selected as June 1–3, 2006 during a summer synoptic condition. A moderate easterly synoptic flow associated with a high pressure over the subtropical North Atlantic Ocean prevailed during this period. The coarse meteorological data is chosen from two sources i.e., the NCEP FNL analyses, and the EDAS Eta analyses. The FNL analyses is prepared by combining observations with short-range forecasts from a global model and the data are available on the surface and 26 vertical levels from 1,000 mb to 10 mb at a spatial resolution of roughly 100 km at 6 h intervals. EDAS is a regional analyses for North America based on the Eta regional model. These data are available at 3 h intervals on Eta 212 grid at a spatial resolution of 40 km on 26 vertical levels from 1,000 mb to 50 mb. To obtain high-resolution meteorological fields a simulation is conducted with the Advanced Research WRF (ARW) meso-scale model (V2.2) [
The details of the meso-scale simulation are given in [
The Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model [
The advection of a particle or puff is computed from the grid scale three-dimensional velocity vectors obtained from the meso-scale model. The horizontal turbulent velocity components at any given time are computed from the turbulent velocity components at the previous time, an autocorrelation coefficient that depends upon the time step, the Lagrangian time scale, and a computer generated random component. The lagrangian time scales TLw (vertical) = 100 s and TLu (horizontal) = 10,800 s are assumed to be constant. These values result in a random walk vertical dispersion for most of the longer time steps. Turbulent mixing is calculated using a diffusivity approach based upon vertical stability estimates and the horizontal wind field deformation. The stability estimates are based on surface fluxes when available or the wind and temperature profiles otherwise. Pollutant concentrations are estimated as the integrated mass of individual particles as they pass through the concentration grid which is a matrix of cells, each with a volume defined by its dimensions.
Three simulations were conducted with the HYSPLIT model using i) FNL analysis ii) Eta analysis and iii) WRF model outputs. Results are compared with observations to study the impact of the spatial and temporal resolution of the mean wind on the dispersion pattern. Dispersion simulation is done over a range of 100 km around the sources. A horizontal grid of 2° × 2° with resolution of 0.01° × 0.01° (approximately 1 km × 1 km) and with eight vertical levels 25, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1,000, 2,000 and 5,000 m above ground level (AGL) is considered in HYSPLIT. The emissions data is taken from the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) and comprises normal annual average for the respective sources. From a cluster of elevated point sources located along the MS coast, four major sources are considered in the present study. These are Mississippi Power Company-Plant Jack Watson (MPJ), Chevron Products Company- Pascagoula Oil Refinery (CR), Mississippi Power Company- Plant Victor Daniels (MPV) and Dupont Delisle Facility (DDF) (
The dispersion calculations are made for SO2 species and no seasonal or diurnal variations in the emissions are considered in the present study. Also the plume rise due to plume effluent velocity and plume temperature is not considered in the present study. The point sources considered have exit velocities since power plant plumes are certainly buoyant. The buoyant plumes rise to higher heights before being subjected to downwind transport and dispersion. The plume rise for these buoyant plumes is expected to impact the trajectory paths and concentration results since there is considerable vertical variation in winds and temperature with height. A detailed calculation of plume rise could be done in future work using the next version of HYSPLIT which incorporates the complete plume rise equations. The pollutant plume is treated as top-hat puffs in the horizontal and particle in the vertical. A total of 500 particles or puffs are released during one release cycle with a maximum of 10,000 particles permitted to be carried at any time during the simulation (
Calculations from dispersion models are limited by the nature of the input meteorological data such as the resolution and representation of local terrain features in the low-level wind pattern [
Results of the meso-scale model simulation are given in more detail in [
Simulated forward trajectories from the release locations are noticed to vary with each case of meteorological data (
Dispersion simulation in the present work is evaluated following the procedures outlined in [
Plume pattern in the case of simulation with WRF meteorological fields clearly showed the diurnal alternation in plume direction according to diurnally varying wind flow pattern. Wide spatial and temporal variability of the plume is noticed in the calculations with WRF fields. Also the individual plumes from each of the sources could be clearly seen in the downwind direction in the cases of WRF and EDAS fields. The plume direction was to the east at early morning time (
The concentration distribution shows that the concentration maximum occurred near the source in the cases with FNL and EDAS data fields whereas it occurred away from the source in the case of simulation with WRF. The iso-concentration contours 3.83e-6, 1.47e-6, 5.62e-7, 2.15e-7, 8.25e-8 are seen to extend to larger downwind distances in the simulation with WRF fields as compared to the simulation with EDAS data. Statistics of the concentration distribution in dispersion simulations of different meteorological data are given in
Model concentrations with WRF data are closer to observations up to 40 h and deteriorate thereafter. Statistical parameters of correlation and fractional bias are calculated between observed and calculated concentrations. Correlation (R) is used to represent the scatter among paired measured and predicted values and a fractional bias (normalized bias) (FB) is used to indicate over-prediction or under-prediction [
Higher concentrations observed in coastal regions are generally associated with sea-breeze circulation and shallow mixing during thermal internal boundary layer formation. Downwind concentrations in the three simulations for the afternoon time (18 LT) are shown in
This study explores the impact of using three different meteorological inputs on atmospheric transport and dispersion model solutions calculated by the HYSPLIT model. A case study of 48-h simulation along the coastal region of the Gulf of Mexico is investigated. A chemically non-active tracer is released in HYSLIT from four sites in the coastal zone of MS, with mass corresponding to reported emissions of SO2. Simple statistical verification is done against available SO2 measurements in the study domain. An attempt is made to correlate differences in input wind fields with diurnal trends of observed and HYSPLIT SO2 concentrations.
Simulations with the three data sets clearly indicated differences in the estimated trajectory, plume movement and the concentration patterns. Among the three cases, the predictions from WRF model reveal presence of meso-scale land/sea breeze circulation and associated mixed layer alterations in the Mississippi Gulf coast. The Eta EDAS analysis could show these characteristics to some extent where as they are not represented in the FNL analysis data. Plume pattern with NCEP FNL analysis data followed the large scale flow. The effects of meso-scale sea breeze and IBL effects are not found in the case of calculation with FNL data and EDAS fields. The flow fields from WRF could better simulate the diurnal plume distribution pattern than the other two data sets, which may be due to the resolving ability of the mesoscale model while using a 4-km grid over the study area. Calculations with WRF data clearly show plume recirculation due to sea breeze and follow observed trends of concentration. The relatively uniform plume distribution in the case of FNL is probably due to the large horizontal deformation associated with the coarse wind field data in the case of FNL analysis. The plume distribution in the coastal area is better resolved in the cases of EDAS and WRF fields which could more realistically represent the local scale flow field. There were some deviations in the simulated concentrations in the case of WRF fields in the initial 6 hours which may be because of the model adjustment and spin up to the topography. The deviations in the concentrations are an order more during sea breeze time than during other times (10−6 to 10−7 gms−1). While the downwind concentration falls monotonously in the simulations with FNL and Eta EDAS data, concentrations are noticed to reach maximum values at 25–40 km distance range during the night time and in the afternoon times in the simulations using WRF fields. This may be because of the formation of shallow mixing region during the afternoon and night hours in the WRF simulation. The current study shows improvement in local scale dispersion simulation with the meso-scale analysis data (Eta EDAS) and more specifically using meso-scale fields from WRF fields, especially in plume distribution in the coastal environment. The species used is actually a reactive chemical species (SO2) with contributions from many local and distant sources which makes the model evaluation subject to too many unknowns. However, considering the unknowns common in the three cases, the verification in the present study only focused on general trends. Also the present study uses observations from a single monitoring site for verification. However to distinguish between the influences of the meteorology versus those of subgrid processes in HYSPLIT,more number of verification sites need to be considered, which will be attempted in the future studies. The current study shows in a general way the problems associated with the use of analyses (FNL and EDAS) to represent evolving meteorology over a 48 h period for the atmospheric transport and dispersion applications, especially the inability to represent synoptic-scale and mesoscale vertical motion fields (viz., sea breeze) in a way that is consistent with the horizontal flow field. Also more cases would be required to determine the relative skill when using the three cases of input meteorological data sets.

In connection with communication systems, especially radiotelephone and paging systems, it is well known that the identity and/or functionality of particular subscriber receiver units with whom a calling party or the communication network operator wishes to establish a communication channel is either predetermined and fixed, or can be selected a priori either by the calling party, the communication network operator, or the particular subscriber themselves. By a priori it is implied that the selection is done prior to reception of data by the particular subscriber receiver units.
FIG. 1 depicts the high level operation of a typical prior art communication network. In the figure, a first device originates a request for establishing communication with any one or several of second communication devices. The first device connected to the communication network either via the internet or via a regular Plain Old Telephone System (POTS). Of course, other connecting technologies may also be used for connecting the first communication device to the communication network. The message from the first communication device is packaged and transmitted by the communication network operator to several second communication devices through localized Towers or Base Stations or Exchanges (nomenclature well recognized by one skilled in the art). Only a subset of the several second communication devices recognizes its address embedded in the transmitted message and consequently only this subset receives the transmitted message.
FIG. 2 depicts the operation of a prior art second communication device used in conjunction with the existing communication network depicted in FIG. 1. The transmitted signal contains an identification tag, labeled Transmitted ID in the figure, indicating which one or several of the second communication devices are to process the accompanying message data. The box labeled Front End in the figure encapsulates all the circuitry in the device required for interfacing the device with the communication network and extracting the contents of the transmitted signal (i.e., Transmitted ID and Message). The Transmitted ID is checked for equivalence with a locally stored ID and if there is a match (i.e., the two are equal), the accompanying Message data is further processed to result in some appropriate action (e.g., display of message, generation of tone, etc.). If there is no match the Message data is discarded and the receiver simply ignores the incoming transmitted signal.
For ease of understanding, the block diagram of the communication device in FIG. 2 is divided into three different spaces: Data Space, Filter Space, and Action Space. The Data Space in FIG. 2 simply consists of one or several pre-defined numerical values (referred to here as ID values) using which the particular device can be identified. These ID values may be unique or shared with other devices; however, in all cases they are predetermined before transmission of data to the device. The Filter Space is responsible for checking equality between Transmitted ID and local ID and generating a True/False answer. In essence the output of the Filter Space determines whether or not the Transmitted Message was intended for reception by the communication device. The Action Space is the result of processing of the received message in the event Filter Space returns True, else it is null, i.e., there is no action.
The invention relates to a method and a system for establishing a communication channel between a first communication device, or alternatively, a communication network operator, and one or more second communication devices. The identity of the one or more second communication devices is not pre-determined by the first communication device (or the communication network operator). Instead, in certain embodiments the identity of which one or more of the second communication devices connects to the first communication device (or the network operator) is determined by the operation of one or more filters transmitted by the first communication device (or the network operator) on certain data. The data may be transmitted by the first communication device (or the network operator) as well as measured locally at each of the second communication devices.
By virtue of the fact that the nature of the transmitted filter, the value of transmitted data, and the value of locally measured data is variable, i.e., can change with time, the identity of the same second communication device itself can change with time. Further, since the value of locally measured data is typically not determinable by the first communication device, the first communication device cannot determine the identity of second communication device a priori.
A further aspect of this invention relates to the fact that a communication channel established between the originating communication device that makes a request and one or more selected communication devices, each connected to an entity that can service the request, includes a feedback loop that enables the requesting device to continuously receive status updates of the servicing entities through their respective communication devices. Selection of the called communication devices may or may not be dynamically determined.
A further understanding of the nature and advantages of the present invention may be realized by reference to the remaining portions of the specification and the drawings.

FIG. 2 shows the operation of a communication device in conjunction with the prior art communication system depicted in FIG. 1;

FIG. 8 is a detailed block diagram of an embodiment of the service operator.
The present invention embodies a scheme that significantly enhances the value of currently deployed communication networks by increasing the intelligence of the attached communication devices as well as enriching the message protocol between the various communication devices and the communication network to take advantage of the enhanced intelligence in the communication devices. The present invention provides more flexibility to the users of the communication network and the network operator by allowing the identity of the attached communication devices to vary, possibly in a non-deterministic manner. (In the context of this invention the word "identity" implies a measure that is used to determine whether or not a communication device is the one that is intended for reception of a transmitted message. More than one device may share the same identity.) Furthermore, the nature of variance of the identity of any particular communication device is not required to be known a priori to any device, user, or the network operator. Rather, the actual identity of a particular device is computed using information contained in the transmitted signal and certain other dynamically varying parameters that are only locally available at the device, and furthermore, only at the instant that the identity is computed is it known to that device as to whether or not the transmitted signal was intended for reception by it.
This is in contrast with existing prior art communication networks, especially radiotelephone and paging networks, wherein the identity of any communication device attached to the network is known prior to transmission of any message intended to be processed by said communication device. In certain prior art communication networks, such as television and radio broadcast networks, the sender is not required to know the identity of any receiver unit prior to transmission of data. However, in these networks, the receiving entity needs to know, a priori, which data it is desirous of receiving before it can receive that data. Reception of desired data is then accomplished by "tuning" the receiver to a predetermined mode that is compatible with the transmission format of the desired data.
There are several possible situations, especially when the originator and receiver of information are physically separated, when it is not known a priori as to whether or not a certain receiver requires the information. This is because generally the conditions under which the receiver requires information depend on certain locally varying parameters, such as geographic location, temperature, direction of motion, etc., depending on the application, as well as certain other conditions that are set by the originator of the communication.
For example, in a certain application the originator of the information may want to communicate a particular emergency message to all mobile receiver units that are currently located in a specific geographic region (say within a pre-specified radius of an accident). Which receiver units are eligible to receive the particular emergency signal can only be determined at the instant the communication has to occur, since the movements of all the mobile receiver units are unknown to the sender of the signal. Additionally, even though each receiver unit may know in advance its exact movements, it cannot anticipate at what instant a message is going to originate from the sender, as well as what geographic constraints are embedded in it. Consequently, it cannot choose a priori the type of message it wants to receive. Furthermore, if a particular receiver unit moves outside the specified geographic zone, it is no longer eligible to receive the same message, even though the transmitted signal "may still be visible to it"; in other words, after leaving the specified geographic zone, it assumes a different identity with respect to the said message. Prior art communication receivers and networks do not readily support implementation of such a flexible communication paradigm.
FIG. 3 depicts the operation of a communication device when it is used in conjunction with a communication network that supports the scheme embodied in the present invention. The differences between the diagrams in FIG. 3 and FIG. 2 are related to the information contained in the Transmitted signal, the Data Space, and the Filter Space.
The Transmitted ID field of the transmitted signal in the present invention is significantly enhanced as compared to prior art systems to include additional data along with one or more "filters". A filter, in the context of this invention, is simply an algorithm or a rule that when applied to certain data results in a True/False answer.
Prior art communication networks also employ a filter, albeit a degenerate "equality" filter, that simply verifies equality between two numbers. This was illustrated in FIG. 2. Furthermore, the filter definition in prior art implementations is fixed and not alterable once the communication device is deployed. For this reason the definition of the filter is not required to be transmitted in prior art communications since every communication device already knows it. Only the data is transmitted and this has been referred to in FIG. 2 as Transmitted ID.
The actual specification of filters in the transmitted signal of the present invention is a matter of implementation. In certain networks, where it is desired that the implementation be simple, the network operator and all communication devices agree a priori to a certain set of applicable filter definitions. Each one of these filter definitions is assigned a unique code and the mapping between filter definition and code is stored in non-volatile memory in every communication device. The communication network also has a copy of this mapping available to it. Whenever a particular filter definition is required to be transmitted, its corresponding code (along with any required data) is transmitted instead. All receiving communication devices and the network can regenerate the filter definition from their local copy of the mapping. In certain other networks, where it is desired to have significant sophistication, entire definitions of filters are transmitted. The definitions are in the form of object code that can be executed in all communication devices. Alternatively, the definitions may be in the form of a platform-independent language, such as Java. In this case each communication device is equipped with an appropriate interpreter (such as a Java interpreter) using which it can convert the filter definition into an executable set of commands.
Another feature of the invention relates to the Data Space over which the filter operates. In prior art communication devices the Data Space consists of one or several pre-determined numerical values, which are used to specify the identity of the communication device. The Filter Space operation consists of verifying equality between any one of these values and the Transmitted ID value. In this invention, the Data Space can be significantly expanded to include not only stored, pre-determined values, but also values that are dynamically generated through measurement of one or more localized parameters. For example, in one embodiment, the localized parameter is the geographic location of the communication device, as measured or indicated by a GPS receiver that is connected locally to the communication device. In another embodiment, the localized parameter is a temperature value that is input to the communication device from a temperature sensor connected to it. In yet another embodiment, the localized value is an indicator of current inventory status of certain merchandise that is being monitored by the user of the communication device. These are but illustrations of quantifiable parameters whose value is being input to the communication device. The important point is that the locally generated value is not necessarily fixed and unvarying; rather, it can vary with time depending on the local conditions surrounding the communication device.
The locally generated parameter values can be entered into the communication device either on a continual basis, or they may be sampled at discrete time instants. This is a matter of implementation and is dependent on the particular application.
Another feature of the invention relates to the Filter Space. As mentioned previously, the Filter Space in prior art implementation consists of the operation of checking equality between the Transmitted ID and one or more of locally stored ID values in the device's Data Space. In the present invention the Filter Space is expanded to imply a generalized filter operation on data carried as part of the Transmitted signal, as well as the dynamically varying data available from the communication device's Data Space. The filters used for the operation may be either stored in the communication device's non-volatile memory, or they may be downloaded from the received signal, as described above. The result(s) obtained from the filter(s) operations is(are) used to determine if the Transmitted Message is intended to be received by the communication device. In other words, the result(s) determine the identity of the communication device with respect to said Transmitted Message.
An important consequence of including dynamically varying local data in the Data Space is that the result of applying the transmitted filter to the data can no longer be predicted in advance by the communication device, its user, or the network. Since the purpose of applying the filter is to determine whether or not a particular communication device is eligible to receive the message, it is quite possible that the same device may or may not be found eligible to receive a particular message based on the available data in its Data Space. In other words, the identity of any communication device is no longer fixed, but is dynamically determined by its local conditions.
FIG. 4 shows a specific embodiment of the device described with reference to FIG. 3. The unit depicted in FIG. 4 contains a Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) receiver, a communication transceiver suited to the appropriate network the unit is designed for, and a micro-controller. The function of the Data Space portion of the generalized module described in FIG. 3 is fulfilled by the GPS receiver. The purpose of the GPS receiver is to monitor the signals available from the GPS satellites and determine the location of the unit. This scheme is well established and known to those skilled in the art. The current location of the unit, i.e., latitude, longitude and altitude, is the local data on which the downloaded filter operates. The function of the communication transceiver sub-system in FIG. 4 is to provide connectivity to the external network.
The Filter Space of the unit in FIG. 4 is implemented as software inside the host micro-controller. For example, in a specific application, the definition of the downloaded filter may be: "return true if current location is within a pre-specified distance of a pre-specified location." In other words, executing the filter involves determining if the distance between the pre-specified (i.e., downloaded) location and the unit's current location is smaller than the pre-specified (i.e., downloaded) distance value. This can be done inside the micro-controller; the result is also interpreted by the software in the micro-controller using which it determines the actions to be taken. The Action Space in FIG. 4 is represented by the user interface arrow ("user I/F"), which is controlled by the host micro-controller.
It can be appreciated by those skilled in the art that implementing the Filter Space as software renders it relatively simple to change the filter definition. For example, the definition of the filter in the previous paragraph can be easily altered to imply a different distance calculation. The same unit that responds to the first filter with a true condition may respond to the second filter with a false condition. In other words, the identity of the unit changes with the definition of the filter, as has already been explained above.
FIG. 5 illustrates a further aspect of this invention. This aspect relates to applications involving situations in which an entity requests a service from a remote location. The request is made through existing bi-directional communication networks that allow the service operator to communicate back with the requester. However, the service being requested itself is of such nature that it requires physical movement of one or more entities from a remote location to the requester, an activity that cannot be performed using the communication network over which the request is made. (In contrast, an example of an application wherein the requester is serviced over the same network as the one on which the request is made is downloading of data over a computer network. In this case the request is made from one computer to another over, say, an ISDN network. The response is transmission of computer data over the same ISDN network back to the first computer.)
FIG. 5 depicts a situation wherein a person involved in an automobile accident requires prompt medical attention. The person makes the request to the service operator using an existing communication network, e.g., PSTN, cellular, etc. In one embodiment of the invention, all communication between the terminal unit and the service operator is carried out via exchange of only data signals, i.e., without the exchange of voice or video signals. One advantage of communication using data-only signals is the low bandwidth requirement of non-audio/non-video signals.
The terminal unit attached to the calling person is similar to the one whose block diagram appears in FIG. 4. Essentially, this terminal unit contains within it a "location-calculator", such as a GPS receiver, a communication transceiver and a micro-computer. When the user triggers a panic call a specially coded message is transmitted from the terminal device to the service operator containing information such as the identity code of the user and the terminal device, the nature of the emergency, the current location of the terminal device, and the time at which the call was triggered.
On receiving the request the service operator performs several actions, including, validation and authentication of the person requesting the service, determining the nature of the emergency, determining if the calling person has any special needs such as those relating to specific health conditions, determining the location of the calling person, and determining the most appropriate emergency response unit (ERU) to summon. As depicted in FIG. 5 the service operator is connected to an entity called the Subscriber Management Element (SME), whose role is to store and provide all the relevant information relating to the subscriber, such as identification, password, address, credit history, billing status, etc.
Once the service operator determines the most appropriate ERU to call (based on, among other factors, the location of the calling person and any special needs they may have), it transmits a message to the Service Dispatch Center (SDC) indicating all the relevant information pertaining to the subscriber and the particular emergency situation. The responsibility of the SDC is to call the ERU as directed by the service operator.
In one embodiment of this system the service operator is completely automated, i.e., implemented without the involvement of any human being in the processing of data. It is possible to implement the dispatching of the ERU by the SDC using the dynamic addressing scheme described in the first aspect of this invention although it is not necessary for the purposes of the second aspect of this invention that the first aspect be used.
Establishing the initial contact with the ERU triggers the generation of a first confirmation or acknowledgement signal from the SDC to the service operator. This first confirmation is immediately relayed to the calling person by the service operator. The purpose of the initial acknowledgement is to immediately notify the person in distress that his/her request has been received by the appropriate response unit. In one embodiment of the invention, the Expected Time of Arrival (ETA) of the ERU at the site of the accident is also presented to the person.
In the system architecture of FIG. 5, all messages between the terminal unit, the service operator, and the SDC are time-stamped. This means the time of the original call, the actual time at which the ERU is first notified, as well as the time of the first acknowledgement, are all captured and logged in the system.
In most situations it is not possible for the ERU to instantaneously arrive at the location of the caller, even though the ERU may respond immediately to the initial call. However, it could be beneficial for the original caller to be made aware of the progress being made by the ERU toward providing the requested service, e.g., how near the ERU is to the caller, or how soon it is going to reach the caller. Depending on the situation this information may be used by the caller to mitigate his/her current exigency.
This invention extends the concept of the initial acknowledgement to include transmission of current status of the ERU to the original caller on a continual basis via the bi-directional communication network. An aspect of this invention is that such status updates are provided automatically without the intervention of any human being. For this to happen the ERU has to be equipped with a device similar to that depicted in FIG. 4, i.e., a device that can compute its current geographical coordinates and communicate that to a remote device.
Again, referring to FIG. 5, once the SDC has established the initial call with the ERU, it obtains all necessary parameters of the particular ERU that are required to maintain communications with that ERU, in particular the address of the terminal device attached to the ERU. This information is sent back to the service operator, upon the receipt of which the service operator establishes a direct connection with the ERU. Once a connection is established the ERU can transfer information regarding its current status to the service operator for further relay to the calling person. For example, the ETA of the ERU based on its current location can be computed and relayed back to the calling person. Information may be uploaded from the ERU to the service operator either automatically by the ERU (i.e., whenever it wants to), or it may be uploaded on-demand from the service operator (i.e., whenever it is asked to upload by the service operator). To those skilled in the art it is easy to appreciate that either mechanism can be easily deployed, and it is a matter of implementation choice as to which one is actually employed in a particular embodiment.
There are several possible configurations that enable the system to capture and relay back to the calling person the status of the ERU. The different configurations trade-off the amount of intelligence residing in the terminal unit carried by the ERU and the service operator. FIG. 6 depicts a table showing the trade-off between the ERU and the service operator. In FIG. 6 the direction of increasing ERU terminal device intelligence corresponds to decreasing service operator intelligence, and vice versa. For example in the first row of the matrix, it is shown that the terminal device in the ERU merely knows what its destination is (this would have been conveyed to it by the SDC). In contrast, the service operator determines the location of the ERU using raw GPS data transmitted to it by the ERU terminal device, computes the ETA at the emergency location, computes the requester's address value (i.e., matches the incoming ERU message to the destination's address), and finally transmits the information to the requester. At the other extreme, as shown in the bottom row of the matrix in FIG. 6, all the above steps are performed in the ERU itself, and the service operator merely relays any information from the ERU to the requester. The other cases in FIG. 6 all fall between these two extremes. Which one of the different configurations is deployed in a particular embodiment is a matter of implementation choice.
There are several methods for computing the ETA given the current location of an entity and its intended destination location. One simple mechanism is to first compute the distance between the current point and the destination point and divide the result by the average speed of travel. The quotient obtained through the division added to the current time at the destination results in the ETA at the destination. Depending on available information it may be possible to improve upon the ETA number by taking into account any real-life conditions, such as anticipated traffic delay during rush hour. Distance computation between two points on the surface of the earth, given their latitude, longitude and altitude is a well-researched topic, and many formulas for the same exist in prior art.
FIG. 7 shows additional details of the terminal device depicted in FIG. 4. In FIG. 7 the GPS subsystem captures and records the geographic location of the terminal unit. GPS stands for Global Positioning System, and is a system made freely available to the public by the U.S. Government. A short description of the GPS system is given below; however, its operation is well known to those skilled in the art and can be found easily in existing literature.
The GPS system consists of 24 satellite orbiting the earth at an approximate height of 11,000 miles. Each satellite completes a revolution around the earth in about 12 hours. Signals transmitted by multiple satellites are captured by the GPS subsystem and used to determine its geographic co-ordinates.
The front-end of the GPS subsystem consists of an active antenna that bandpass filters the satellite signals at a frequency of 1575.42 MHz, amplifies it using a Low Noise Amplifier (LNA) and feeds it to an RF downconverter, which down-converts the incoming frequency and further filters the signal before transferring it to an analog-to-digital convertor. The typical frequency of the signal at the output of the RF processor is 430 KHz. This signal processing is well known to those skilled in the art. The digitized signal leaving the analog-to-digital converter is subsequently decoded by a baseband processor. The baseband processor is typically a DSP chip with embedded firmware that is optimized to handle the GPS signals, although other, more hardware based, implementations are also possible. Using information from 4 satellites simultaneously, the GPS subsystem can accurately track the longitude, latitude, altitude and velocity of the mobile unit.
The function of the communication subsystem in FIG. 7 is to provide connectivity to the terminal unit with the communication network. In general, with reference to the system described in connection with FIG. 5, the actual nature of the communication network is not important to this invention, so long as this network supports basic, low bandwidth, bi-directional message passing.
In FIG. 7, the GSM digital cellular network is used as an example for the communication network. GSM is a recently ratified global wireless standard, available in most of the world's nations. It supports a rich and flexible messaging protocol called Short Message Service, or SMS, which can be used for the transferring the messages between the requesting entity, service operator, service dispatch center, and response unit of FIG. 5. Although GSM is used as an example of a particular embodiment other wireless communication standards such as CDMA and TDMA can also be used in the context of FIG. 5. The portions of the terminal unit affected by the network technology relate to the communication subsystem; the overall functionality remains the same.
The GSM signal is transmitted around one of three frequencies depending on the location of the network: 900 MHz, 1800 MHz, and 1900 MHz. However, the basic protocol structure and encoding technology is the same in all cases. As in the GPS data path, the incoming analog RF frequency is filtered, downconverted, digitized and decoded by the DSP. The firmware in the DSP extracts information retrieved from the incoming signal and passes it to the microprocessor. The process for outgoing messages is reversed.
The unit includes an RF transceiver, which performs the functions of decoding and encoding of data. There is no support for voice data in the terminal unit of FIG. 7. The host computer subsystem in FIG. 7 comprises a simple microcontroller along with small amounts of volatile and non-volatile memory. The microcontroller controls the GPS and communication subsystems as well as interacts with the user. Memory is required for storing both the resident application software as well as other data relating to the use of the terminal unit. The unit further includes a Subscriber Interface Module (SIM), whose function is similar to the SIM modules used in GSM cellular phones, as is known to those skilled in the art. The user I/F represents the keypad, display and other interfaces required to communicate with the user.
FIG. 8 depicts the architecture of the service operator entity of FIG. 5. As described above, the service operator is the "brains" of the system. It is the hub of the entire system, connecting to the terminal unit attached to the requester, the subscriber management element, the service dispatch center, and the response unit. It performs authentication and validation of the requesting entity based on information obtained from the subscriber management element, message routing, determination of location and type of service requested, directing the service dispatch center operator to the appropriate response unit, and returning service status information to the requesting entity. The service operator is preferably implemented to execute as a fully redundant system with no single points of failures.
FIG. 8 depicts an embodiment of the service operator that presents an extremely modular design wherein the externally visible applications are separated from the supporting hardware and software. A distributed-modular architecture allows for system scaling with subscriber growth. The specific embodiment of FIG. 8 depicts the service operator as having several communication ports. The need for any of these ports is dependent on the implementation, and is typically the choice of the system designer.
The lowest layer of the software consists of all the drivers and RAID controller. The function of the RAID controller is to control the RAID database array that stores all the information relating to all subscribers. The choice of RAID is for illustration purposes only; certainly other storage schemes could be employed. Just above the driver layer in FIG. 8 sits the "middleware" portion of the service operator. The modules shown in the figure are merely for purposes of illustration; other modules could be required in certain other embodiments of the service operator. The highest software layer is the Application Graphical User Interface (GUI) that allows rapid and flexible development of applications.
The service dispatch center in FIG. 8 consists of fault-tolerant computers redundantly connected to the service operator. These computers are staffed by qualified operators who promptly respond to incoming messages from the service operator by calling the appropriate response units. An initial acknowledgement is returned to the network server as soon as the appropriate response unit has been notified, as described above.
To maintain accurate logs of all transactions, every message is allocated a unique identity code, messages belonging to the same session are tagged to indicate the link between them, and every message is time and date-stamped at the transmitting and receiving stations. The function of the Subscriber Billing Computer in FIG. 8 is to maintain all the financial records relating to the person requesting the service. This includes information such as level of service subscribed to, and credit and payment history. The service operator interacts with the Subscriber Billing Computer to determine the level and quality of service to be provided to the requesting entity.
As described above the terminal device attached to the response unit can come in several flavors, as depicted in FIG. 6. In one embodiment, the terminal unit uses the architecture depicted in FIG. 7; such a unit can compute its location, and possibly even its ETA at the target destination. This information is uploaded to the service operator whenever the latter demands the data, as described above. of course other embodiments are possible as depicted in FIG. 6. However, in all embodiments the basic communication subsystem supports the transfer of information between the response unit and the service operator.

Nigeria has the third largest internally displaced population in the world. Now comes Boko Haram. Neither the government nor international organizations have systematically assessed the situation.
- A woman from Gwoza, Borno State, displaced by the violence and unrest caused by the insurgency, weeps at a refugee camp in Mararaba Madagali, Adamawa State, February 18, 2014.Reuters/FileView Caption
A version of this post appeared in Africa in Transition. The views expressed are the author's own.
In a recent report the Norwegian Refugee Council and its Internal Displacement Monitoring Center estimate that there are 3.3 million displaced persons in Nigeria. It says that Nigeria’s displaced population is the third largest in the world, following Syria and Colombia, and the largest in Africa.
Boko Haram, and the efforts by the government to defeat it, account for 254,816 displaced in Borno, Yobe, and Adamawa states, all places where a declared state of emergency is in effect.
The population displaced by ethnic, religious, and land-use conflicts in Nigeria's Middle Belt may be larger. The report also notes road building projects in Lagos in February 2014 made some 9,000 homeless.
The Nigerian federal agency directly involved with the internally displaced, the National Emergency Management Agency, offers that little is known about the protection and assistance needs of Nigeria’s displaced population. Neither the government nor international organizations have systematically assessed the situation.
Parts of the northeast are inaccessible to humanitarian workers because of security issues. Most of the displaced live with extended families or hosts of the same ethnic group.
The government has established camps in the Middle Belt and also in Bauchi state to accommodate those fleeing the northeast.
Conditions within the camps are said to be poor. In the coming year, there will be concerns about food security.
In the three states under a state of emergency, the Norwegian Refugee Council estimates that over 60 percent of the region’s farmers were displaced before the planting season began.
The international community needs to pay more attention to this pending humanitarian disaster, which risks destabilizing not only Nigeria but also its immediate neighbors.
A systematic survey needs to be conducted, insofar as the security situation allows. Then there needs to be a coherent strategy for meeting the humanitarian needs of a region which, even in the best of times, is one of the poorest in the world.
These are not the best of.rabbitsbdk Review

(10.53 billion pounds).
Yahoo acknowledged that it was in talks with Alibaba, during its first-quarter earnings conference call with analysts last month. During the call, Thompson said the two companies were working on a "simplified" transaction to "monetize" a portion of Yahoo's stake in Alibaba.
To fund the deal, Alibaba would raise capital. The valuation that Alibaba receives in the fund-raising will determine how much Yahoo earns in the transaction, the source said.
In September, Alibaba was valued at $32 billion when Silver Lake and other firms invested in the company, according to media reports at the time. At that valuation, Yahoo could make $4.8 billion to $8 billion by selling 15 to 25 percent of Alibaba.
"Of all the previous ones we've worked on, this one feels like it might actually have a chance of getting done. Or at least it did until a day and a half ago," the person said, referring to the controversy around Thompson's resume.
Details of the talks were first reported by the Wall Street Journal on Friday.

Sorry I can't give you any solid advice - no doubt other folk here will be able to help.
I would only say that, if it is expensive to hire someone, wouldn't it be just as expensive to outsource it? After all, the work will involve the same effort and the same skills.

Brian Orelli Geron has two diffrent drugs in Phase 2 trials. Imetelstat is in multiple phase 2 trials with results coming in the end of 2012. Geron has not completely given up on Stem Cells they have just come to the conclusion that they can not afford to advance those programs currently with the EU ruling on Stem Cell Patents and the current ecconomic climmant they will only proceed with apartner. Geron is currently in Patent litigation with Viacyte over definitive Endo derm cell types. this litigation covers Hepatocytes and Islet cells. Geron is the senior Party in this litigation. April 5 is the date this is supposed to go to the judge as the last filing in the case will have been completed. Viacyte is partialy owned by J&J and has licensing deals on some of these cell types with Pfizer and Cellular Dynamics. I would not expect Geron to complete their partnership deal until this litigation ends. The EU needs to fix their legislation on Stem cell patent abillity or the result would be a company developes treatments at great expense then anyone could do those treatments. The Spinal cord trial has had no adverse effects and there is no cavitation at the injury site. The dose used in the trial was 1/10th of the estimated effective dose. There is no sign of any teratomas or other signs of cancer developing from the treatment. The ecconomics for the trial made were not there for cost recovery from cost of treatment and cost of research for acute spinal cord injury. The bigger more cost effective target for OPC1 is MS. They have reported compelling data to support this in primates. The most puzzling move by Geron this year is the handing out $600,000 dollars in bonuses to 4 executives in a year that has seen the stock price drop 73% and they ended the Stem Cell programs because they needed to conserve capital how can the Board of directors justify these bonuses. One has to ask how the new CEO can say they have not lost anything in the Cancer pipeline with his act Geron has halted GRNVAC1 and GRNVAC2. The DDO in the UK had approved funding for GRNVAC2 phase 1 trials.

Geron's stem cell program is of deep personal significance to me since it has given my wife, a Parkinson's patient, at least seven extra years of life (and counting).
On April 10th 1996 , she was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder. In June, 2000 her psychiatrist noted behavioral symptoms not necessarily associated with Bipolar Disorder and recommended she be evaluated neurologically. The examination revealed she was additionally suffering from Parkinson’s Disease. Over the next four years the Parkinson’s symptoms developed rapidly. By August, 2004 it had reached Stage 4 with symptoms including facial paralysis, asymmetric tremor, mental confusion, deteriorating eyesight, limited short and long term memory and others.
During the two years following her diagnosis, we explored various treatment options through contact with research institutions, studying medical publications and browsing the internet. Nothing emerged as obvious until I attended the March Meeting of the Santa Clara Section of the American Chemical Society featuring a presentation by Geron's then President, Dr. Thomas Okarma, entitled “Human Embryonic Stem Cells – Progress and Promise”. Following the formal presentation I joined a number of other scientists, in a lively discussion with Tom. As the conversation progressed, I became convinced that pluripotent human embryonic stem cell therapy could be a basis for treating Parkinson’s.
No reputable clinics willing or able to provide this type of therapy could be located in North America. As a result we worked a clinic in Europe. On September 8, 2004 she was infused with 1.5 MM pluripotent CD34+ cells derived from Cord Blood. Specialized subsets (CD133+/- and CD34-) were included in the infusion. We remained in our hotel for a week following the treatment to allow for adverse reaction. A transient 1°F increase in temperature was the only symptom noted.
Positive changes were unexpectedly rapid with some occurring within a couple of weeks. These changes included regain of facial expression and improvement in cognitive ability. She described it as like a curtain being drawn back in her mind. In subsequent weeks vast improvement in long and short term memory became apparent. We later realized that she was no longer lactose intolerant. Lower back pain resulting from a prior lumbar disk problem was greatly reduced.
In September, 2006, we traveled to the Miami offices of renowned Parkinson’s specialist Dr. Abraham Lieberman. At the time he was Medical Director of the Miami based National Parkinson’s Foundation. He currently is the Director of the Muhammad Ali Parkinson Center at the Barrow Neurological Institute in Phoenix. Dr. Liebermann confirmed that Margaret’s Parkinson’s disease appeared to have been arrested. His observations were confirmed by whole body MRI imaging a month later. The MRI also documented repair of the spinal cord lesion and of some Parkinson’s related brain damage. There had been hope, (basis studies at Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia and at the University of Copenhagen hypothesizing a common etiology between Parkinson’s and Bipolar Disorder) that the therapy could have had a positive effect on her bipolar disorder. Unfortunately, this has not been the case.
The research of Geron and others has centered on differentiation of pluripotent stem cells into populations targeted to address specific injury or disease. This would result in high value therapies. Since there were no Parkinson’s targeted differentiated cells available to us, we were had to rely on the natural ability of pluripotent cells to identify and target conditions in her body – which they did. We had only to address the blood-brain barrier and other issues such as heavy metals and certain other materials with teratogenic tendencies.
I mention this because our experience infers a basic difficulty in isolating high value therapies that would be of profitable interest to Geron (or any other company looking for a reasonable return on R&D Investment). This could be another instance of new technology eventually capable of turning an existing business model on its ear. Anyone want to invest in a factory making buggy whips, 8 track tapes or a slide rules?Reunited and It Feels So Good: Faith No More at Coachella, Plus Mike Patton's Thoughts on the Festival
It's half-way through Faith No More's Saturday night set at Coachella and Mike Patton is already being groped and grabbed by the audience. No sooner had the band begun to wind down its cheeky rendition of Michael Jackson's "Ben" than the crooner leapt into the pit of festival-goers, his microphone clenched in his mouth, as a sea of sweaty hands tumbled the crowd-surfing frontman back toward the stage.
"Yee-haw!" someone shouted high above the festival roar. It might have taken over a decade for Faith No More to reunite after the band's 1998 split, but it took only 20 minutes in the desert for the audience to fall back in love with them.
Patton's stage presence with Faith No More has always bordered on maniacal, and his playful yet aggressive interaction with the audience is what people come to expect (and want), like they'd be disappointed if they weren't getting slapped around or barked at.
Prior to Coachella, I asked Patton some questions on the subject of audience interaction and about Faith No More's reunion during our interview for CAMP magazine, an exclusive put together by URB, Golden Voice and Vans, and distributed solely for die-hard campers at this year's music and arts festival.
"With Faith No More, even though we're a bunch of old men, what I remember about our best shows is some sort of confrontation with the audience," Patton said. "I didn't even have to think about it ... When we started doing these shows, that element about what I do when I perform came back. It's not planned, it's not thought out. I really even sometimes think to myself, 'Hey let's just play the show tonight, don't be an asshole, don't pick a fight, don't do this, don't do that...' and then things happen, you know?"
Patton continued, ."
Playing it up is an understatement. Saturday night at Coachella the band took the stage dressed in suits, Patton slowly making his way to the mic stand using a walking cane, and started the set slow with a cover of "Reunited" by Peaches and Herb. Yeah, the Faith No More guys still have their senses of humor firmly intact, but the old man schtick only lasted so long before Patton ditched the cane, rolled up his sleeves and the band launched into the decidedly more aggro "From Out of Nowhere." Like a maestro pugilist Patton crouched and hovered on stage as if to pounce, and then leapt towards the audience with a flick of his tongue, cracking his microphone chord like a whip.
The rest of the set included "Caffeine," "We Care a Lot" (and we cared even more that Chuck Mosely wasn't in attendance to
botch sing it like he did earlier in the week at San Francisco's Warfield gig), "Last Cup of Sorrow," "Surprise! You're Dead," "Midlife Crisis," and "Epic," amongst others. Added bonus? During Faith No More's last song "Just a Man," Danny DeVito (actor and Limoncello enthusiast) darted across the sage, all smiles and with his shirt flying wide open. DeVito wasn't the only return Coachella attendee still stoked on the thee-day festival, however. There's a reason Patton keeps coming back as well, whether with Faith No More this year or with Fantomas, Peeping Tom or Rahzel in years past.
"To be honest, [Coachella] is one of the few festivals that I will play at and also go see a bunch of bands," Patton said. "I feel like in some strange way I am in decent company. That alone gives me the comfort to want to keep coming back with whatever configuration I may have, and this time it's a no-brainer with Faith No More. Most festivals you get in and you get the hell out [laughs]. You don't want to talk to anyone; you don't want to see anyone. That's kind of my festival etiquette. I'm not proud of it. [Festivals can be] incredibly impersonal and not conducive to making good music."
He continued, "There's good shit at Coachella and that tells me that the people that book it know what they're doing. Seriously, all you gotta do is make a list [of bands you want to see] and then do your best to follow through on it. The hardest part is you're going to miss about half of what you want to do because the stages are so far away."
So who was on Patton's list of bands to check out this year?
"Ooh. Well, this is a guilty pleasure: Corrine Bailey Rae. I know. It's so embarrassing but I have to say it. I love her voice. I want to see her sing. So I'm going to see her. I'm going to see a moment of Jay-Z, of course. Gorillaz I am curious about. Gil Scott Heron, come on! I want to see that. I want to see Sly and the Family Stone. Is there any really new vital stuff? Oh, Dillinger Escape Plan! I'll go see them."
Bummer about Sly Stone, but we hope Patton got to enjoy the others. 'Til next year...

Ketan (W/R), June 16, GNA — Alhaji Collins Dauda, Minister of Transport has estimated works on the Western railway lines at 400 million USD.
He said Government was banking its hopes on a Chinese loan facility to start the rehabilitation of the railway lines by the end of the year.
Alhaji Dauda made this known during workers' durbar at a popular site in Ketan in the Western Region, known as 'Bottom Tree', where pertinent issues affecting railway workers and the railway sector were discussed.
The Transport Minister noted that, the economic viability of the railway sector was paramount towards revamping the economy and assured the workers that, Government would not sit aloof for the Ghana Railway Company (GRC) to collapse.
He urged the workers to support every effort being put in place by the Government to revitalise the sector.
Alhaji Dauda observed that the work attitude of the workers would go a long way to determine the fate of the Company.
“There is a popular perception that, public institutions are not well administered because they don't belong to any individual. But if we change our attitude towards public work and work assiduously towards its sustainability, its positive rippling effects would be felt by all,” he stressed.
Alhaji Dauda noted that, the railway sector was the heart of the people in the Region; particularly the people in the Sekondi-Takoradi Metropolis and therefore, Government would do its possible best to secure funding for rehabilitation of the railway lines.
“The current spate of road crashes in the country could be attributed to the inefficiency of the railway sector because heavy duty trucks that ply our roads often cause the accidents.
“…If we rehabilitate the railway lines, people would prefer using trains to cart their goods instead of vehicles since they are affordable and reliable.”
The Minister said he had set up a three-member committee to review the law that established the Ghana Railway Development Authority (GRDA).
According to him, there was the need for the law to be reviewed to ensure effective and efficient management of GRC.
He said: “The promulgation of the law has limited the GRC because the GRDA is the regulator whilst the GRC is the operator thus making decision-taking towards the revitalisation of the sector difficult.”
Alhaji Dauda said as the law stood now, the GRDA had the authority to issue license to the GRC to operate.
He noted that, if the law was reviewed, it would help the restructuring process of the railway sector effectively and efficiently.
Alhaji Dauda charged the Management of the GRC to engage the workers regularly, at least once a month in order to know their problems and concerns.
He advocated the frequent flow of information from the Management to the workers front to ensure trust and transparency.
The Minister said communication was vital towards efficient management of any public or private institution.
He pledged his commitment towards the payment of the workers' salary arrears as well as promotion and collective bargaining agreement issues.
The Acting Managing Director of the GRC, Mr K. B. Amofa said freight traffic remained the mainstay of the company accounting for 90 per cent of the revenue it generated, covering a route length of 947 kilometres.
He said much of the freight traffic were primary commodities such as manganese, bauxite and cocoa meant for export through the Takoradi Port.
Mr Amofa said successive governments failed to use the revenue generated from export to maintain the infrastructure and assets, thus leading to the current deplorable state of the railway lines.
The Acting Managing Director called for major infusion of capital into the railway sector to ensure the realisation of its full potential.
“As at now, about 45 per cent of locomotives and wagons required to run and achieve set freight targets have broken down and are being repaired, but lack of spare parts has delayed their service since some of them are (more than) 50 years and needed to be replaced.
“There is difficulty running cocoa trains due to the poor track infrastructure from Dunkwa to Kumasi while cement and timber trains cannot go to and from Kumasi for the same reason,” he said.
Mr Amofa said the signal and telecommunication systems which were installed in 1984 had broken down thus hampering communication.
During the open forum, workers expressed their sentiments such as low remunerations, late payment of salaries, and lack of information flow from Management.
They called for capital injection to revitalise the operations of the sector.
GNACheck only one piece of luggage. As of 2008, AirTran is still allows one free piece of luggage at no charge. It has to weigh under 50 lbs. and have overall dimensions of 62 inches or less.
How to Avoid AirTran Luggage Fees
No one is happy with the luggage fee policies that have been brought on by many of the major airlines. Consumers are not content at having to pay extra just to have clothes to wear during their trip to Florida or Europe. The airlines aren't satisfied that they had to start charging these fees to contend with the increased costs in fuel that have led to cutbacks in the airline itself.
AirTran, an airline that has always charged low prices for its fares compared to its competitors, has jumped on the bandwagon of charging fees for certain luggage. As a customer this means extra costs for you, unless you can find ways to avoid them.
Instructions
- 1
- 2
Check in for your flight online if you have to check a second piece of luggage. If you check in online, you will only pay $10 for that second piece of luggage instead of the $20 that you will pay at the airport.
- 3
Make use of a friend's extra checked bag space. If you are traveling with at least one other person, do some creative packing. If your boyfriend's bag is half empty and only weighs 20 lbs., put your extra three pairs of shoes and five shirts in with his stuff. This way, nobody has to pay any extra fees.
- 4
Weigh your luggage at home before you leave for the airport. This can help you avoid having that piece of checked baggage weigh 55 lbs. instead of 50 lbs., which forces you to either rearrange your suitcases at the airport, or to pay a fee of $29. It isn't hard to weigh your luggage. You can put the suitcase upright on a small bathroom scale and get a good idea of the weight. There is no need to buy some complex scale to weigh your suitcases.
- 5
Make use of your carry-on luggage. If you used to just have a purse and camera as your one carry on and personal item, think again. You have to utilize every ounce of space you have available in the carry-ons. A personal item is a hangbag or backpack. You would be amazed how much you can fit into a nice size purse, especially with some good organizational skills. The carry-on luggage itself cannot be over 55 inches in total dimension. There really is no weight limit, but if you have something heavy it is supposed to be placed under your seat. A good piece of carry-on luggage packed well won't be too heavy, and you can stow it above your head in the overhead bin.
- 6
Make a list of what you absolutely need for the trip and stick to it. Don't take extra things you won't use. Talk to the other people in your group. If there are five people, you can get away with three umbrellas instead of five. One person can take sunblock instead of everyone having his or her own. Just use the hotel towels for swimming and the beach.
- 7
Pack wisely. Learn the secrets of packing. Roll your clothes up so that you can fit more, and forget about taking hangers. The hotel should provide hangers, or you can ask for them. Utilize all of your space in your luggage. For example, you can place socks and underwear inside of your sneakers to save space.
Tips & Warnings
- If you took a trip to the beach last year and didn't use half of what you packed, recall what you actually did need. When you pack for the trip this year, keep in mind what you needed and only pack those items.
- If you end up not taking something you needed, you can always buy it when you get there if you have to.
- If you can't fit everything you think you will need, plan to purchase less expensive items when you get there. For example, you should take your sneakers that would cost $50 to buy once you arrive, but forget about the shampoo and conditioner that could be purchased for about $5 once you arrive.

Broncos QB Ryan Finley (15) tries to evade Huskies D-lineman Damion Turpin (66) during the first half Friday.
BOISE, Idaho — Once the leader of Boise State’s rise to prominence, Chris Petersen was on the verge of ending the Broncos’ hopes for another special year in the season opener.
After nearly all of their 16-0 lead disappeared, the 23rd-ranked Broncos came up with enough plays to send Petersen home with a loss.
"We weren’t in very good situations in this game and we still responded and were able to find a way to win," Boise State coach Bryan Harsin said.
Jeremy McNichols rushed for 89 yards and two first-half touchdowns, and Boise State withstood a second half filled with special teams mistakes for a 16-13 victory over Washington on Friday night in Petersen’s return to the school he helped grow into a national power.
Boise State (1-0) dominated the first half in building a 16-0 lead. But Washington’s defense stymied the Broncos in the second half and three big plays on special teams, including Dante Pettis’ 76-yard punt return for a touchdown, gave Washington a chance.
Washington’s freshman quarterback Jake Browning nearly pulled off a late rally. Starting at Washington’s 35 with 1:59 left, Browning drove the Huskies (0-1) into field goal range. But Cameron Van Winkle’s 46-yard field goal attempt with 21 seconds left was wide right. Van Winkle had hit from 40 and 28 yards earlier in the game.
Petersen tried to downplay his return to Boise as much as possible. He was hidden in a pack of players when he arrived off the team bus at the stadium, only briefly being seen in a purple sweater. He lingered in the unfamiliar visitors’ locker room, emerging with less than an hour until kickoff surrounded by cameras and acknowledging the cheers from the fans already in the stadium.
He avoided any contact with Harsin until the game was decided, and the two shared a hug at midfield.
"It’s a little different situation when you come back and you play against so many of these coaches that were like brothers to us," Petersen said. "That’s probably been the hardest."
McNichols was the star of the first half as Boise State built an early lead and rolled up 254 yards of offense. But Washington’s defense fixed its issues at halftime and limited the Broncos’ to 83 total yards in the second half.
Boise State quarterback Ryan Finley was 16-of-26 passing for 129 yards and another 30 yards rushing.
Finley said he was pulling together the Boise State offense for a potential last offensive series as Washington was driving. When it came time to watch Van Winkle’s field goal attempt, Finley turned away.
"I heard the crowd. That was pretty exciting," Finley said.
Finley’s debut won’t erase fans’ concerns about the quarterback position, but if the Broncos run game can approach what it was in the first half, it’ll at least ease them. Boise State finished with 185 yards rushing.
Washington hung around because of special teams, specifically the punt team. Pettis returned a short punt 17 yards to set up Van Winkle’s first field goal from 40 yards in the third quarter. Pettis took the next punt he saw back for his second career punt return touchdown, and Jaydon Mickens blocked Sean Wale’s punt in the fourth quarter, leading to Van Winkle’s 28-yard field goal that cut Boise State’s lead to 16-13 with 7:29 remaining.
Browning had the Huskies on the cusp of overtime, driving them to the Boise State 19 before a key holding penalty against wide receiver Brayden Lineus. Browning was sacked on the next play, and a screen pass moved the ball to the Boise State 29 with 21 seconds left.
Petersen called on Van Winkle, but his attempt slid wide right, setting off a celebration that was a mix of joy and relief for the Broncos.
"We didn’t open up last year with a win and this team did," Harsin said.0 Answers

- The movie should fascinate anyone interested in politics, publishing, and the uneasy marriage between big money and mass communication.
- Here is a rich tale of our times, very well told with an appropriate minimum of means.
-
- A thoughtful and surprisingly affecting portrait of a screwed-up man who dared to mess with some powerful people, seen through the eyes of the idealistic kid who chooses to champion his ultimately losing cause.
- What emerges is not only an Underdog v. Simon Bar Sinister saga but a fascinating character study.
- Although the term cinéma vérité is overused as a descriptor for documentaries, it applies here. The makers of Horns and Halos eschew the Michael Moore "poke 'em with a stick, let's watch 'em squirm" approach and wisely let the cameras roll, interspersing news footage with their own interviews.
- Isn't a particularly well-assembled documentary, but the queasy, hypnotic power of its story and subjects makes its technical shortcomings forgivable.

Skirball Celebrity Gathering
The Skirball Cultural Center's Fifth Anniversary Special Founders Dedication of Ahmanson Hall, which took place April 21, was a black-tie affair held -- surprise -- in the elegant and original Moshe Safdie-designed hall. Speakers included Audrey Kenis-Skirball, Morris Bergreen, Robert Ahmanson, Dr. Barry Munitz, Robert Erburu, Lloyd Cotsen (whose family name adorns the Hall's main auditorium) and Skirball president and CEO Dr. Uri D. Herscher. Tablesful of political leaders attended as well, including L.A. City Councilmember Cindy Miscikowski, former Gov. Pete Wilson, city attorney candidate Mike Feuer, Rep. Adam Schiff and County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky. Herscher announced that since opening in 1996, the Skirball has hosted some 2.3 million visitors, who have come to see firsthand how it fulfills its mission of linking 4,000 years of Jewish heritage to the American democratic ideal. In keeping with that theme, students from Hamilton High performed songs by Irving Berlin, George Gershwin and other great American Jewish composers. -- Staff Report
What's New? Nothing, at This Show
The Sixth Annual Los Angeles Antiques Show, organized by the Antiques Dealers Association of California, returns to Barker Hangar in Santa Monica May 4-6, with a special gala preview May 3. The opening night gala will benefit Women's Guild of Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, which has raised more than $14 million for the hospital campus since 1957.
As in previous years, the Antiques Show will feature a vast array of European and American furniture, jewelry and artwork. Particular to this year's exhibition: art owned by Judy Garland, antique Jensen silver and Chinese porcelain.
In attendance on opening night will be this year's honorary chairs: actress Anjelica Huston and her husband, sculptor Robert Graham, and author Wendy Goldberg and her husband, producer Leonard Goldberg. Event chairs Joyce Brandman and Pam Rubin and advisers Beverly Firestein and Caryl Golden are running the event.
"Whether you love antiques or you don't, it's really an amazing cultural experience. What's most exciting for me is the set-up week -- going into this huge, 35,000-square-feet hangar that's very, very empty, and seeing it all come alive. We turn it into something extraordinary," said Abby Levy, the Women's Guild president. She noted that the antique show, the Women's Guild's only annual fundraiser, takes a year to plan and execute.

Celebrating Y.I. of Century City's Quarter
Century
Young Israel of Century City has held its annual Tribute Dinner in celebration of the synagogue's 25th anniversary. Dr. Joel and Leslie Kessler were presented with the Tribute Award. Dr. Kessler has served as head of obstetrics and gynecology at St. John's Hospital. Leslie is a pediatric nurse practitioner.
Happy Birthday, Lillian Kolisch!
David Goldstein, a supervisor at Shalom Retirement Home in the Fairfax District, contacted us to let us know that Shalom celebrated the 100th birthday of Lillian Kolisch. The party included awards and certificates from Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer and U.S. Rep. Henry Waxman.
Kolisch is the last survivor of eight siblings. Last March, Kolisch's brother, Joseph Lazar, passed away at the age of 106.
Kolisch was born in Russia in 1901. Three years later, her family settled in Chicago. Kolisch's father opened a music store chain, which Kolisch and her husband eventually took over. In 1943, Kolisch moved to California. Before her retirement at age 80, Kolisch ran a local toy store. She has been a Shalom resident since 1991.
Tykes on Trikes
Fifty nursery-schoolers hopped on tricycles while participating in the 11th Annual Trike-A-Thon fundraiser at Temple Ramat Zion in Northridge. The children, ages 2-4, raised about $4,000, which will go toward playground accessories to keep children cool during hot weather.
"The Trike-A-Thon is one of my favorite events because it involves the whole family," said Betty Gorelick, director of the temple's nursery school.

Thu Jul 19, 2012 4:01 amThe Aguas del Paraná Consortium – which is headed by Odebrecht Infrastructure in Argentina – achieved a new goal: the conclusion of the second stretch of the tunnel that joins Paraná de las Palmas with the future water treatment unit Juan Manuel de Rosas.
Extending approximately 15 kilometers (km), the tunnel is part of the construction work of the new potable water plant for the company AySA (Agua y Saneamientos Argentinos S.A.).
Using two TBMs (also known as the “tatuzão”) named “Liliana” and “Cristina” to excavate the tunnel, some 63,000 invert precast concrete units were placed during two years of work to form 10,600 concrete rings for the tunnel. During the second phase, the TBM “Liliana” opened up 6.55 km of total course. The TBM “Cristina” was responsible for the first 8 km of tunnel – a stretch delivered in July of this year.
With a diameter of 3.6 meters, the tunnel will allow for the transport of 900,000 cubic meters of water until the AySA treatment plant.using that to slash a current osx owner would have been quicker... so precious!What does PIW stand for?

Anthropogenicism is a religion of the left, proof that when humans reject traditional religious beliefs, they merely go on to create some other faith-based schema to believe in.
I was inspired to write yesterday’s post by recent attempts in New Zealand to ban domestic cats, because humans, by owning cats, are committing “genocide” against rodents and birds. And even though I don’t claim to be psychic (except when I’m doing my “mind-reading” magic tricks while trying to pick up young ladies in a bar), I must say, I was oddly prescient in this instance. Because this morning, the Huffington Post’s “green” section called for U.S. “policy intervention” to deal with the “anthropogenic” menace of domestic cats.
The people specifically calling for this “policy intervention” (why can’t they just come out and say “government intervention?”) are U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service/Department of the Interior bureaucrat Tom Will, Smithsonian Institute/University of Minnesota loon Scott Loss, and Smithsonian Institute/University of Washington crackpot Peter Marra.
I think the only way to grasp the sheer idiocy of their proposal is to quote it directly. So let’s do that:….Our findings suggest that free-ranging cats cause substantially greater wildlife mortality than previously thought and are likely the single greatest source of anthropogenic mortality for US birds and mammals. Scientifically sound conservation and policy intervention is needed to reduce this impact.
These geniuses call for, among other things, the prohibition of outdoor cats of any kind, and the elimination by euthanasia of cats that dare want a moment or two of outdoor time.
Cats, like firearms, are to be regulated by the government as deadly weapons that we lowly serfs are unqualified to own.
Now, let’s examine for a moment the claims that these Einsteins make. They state that cat-on-rodent violence is “anthropogenic” (literally, “human-caused”). Okay, if I were to take a cat and Frankenstein the hell out of it so that it shoots lasers from its eyes and poison darts from its ass (and you gotta admit, that would be kinda cool), THAT would be anthropogenic. But cats killing rodents? That’s NATURE, you f***ing idiots. Humans don’t “make” cats hunt and kill by owning them. In fact, it’s the opposite. Cats are such excellent natural predators, that they make themselves, by virtue of their natural gifts, appealing pets (especially in rural and farming areas).
It’s the “guns kill people” idiocy, but now applied by leftist pseudoscientists to the animal kingdom. It’s the fallacy, “humans own cats, and therefore ‘cause’ rodent and bird deaths,” ignoring the reality, that cats, being natural predators by virtue of inborn traits, become of value to humans.
What we’re witnessing is a religious cult, the Anthropogenicists, doing exactly what superstitious crazies in Europe did hundreds of years ago, when cats were killed en masse because they were “witches,” which led to rats, now unthreatened by their natural predator, spreading the Black Plague that wiped out over a third of Europe’s population. And if you think I’m claiming that Anthropogenicists are as bad as old-time witch-hunters, you’re wrong. I’m saying they’re worse. Because mankind in the 1300s could be excused a certain amount of ignorance. But today, such stupidity is unforgivable.
I’ll confess that I hope the Anthropogenicists continue their anti-cat crusade, because, in the end, the left always overplays its hand. There are too many leftist cat-lovers, and I don’t exactly mind them getting schooled in the concept of how nanny-statism will eventually target something you don’t want to give up. As a historian, I’ve interviewed hundreds of people who fled or abandoned Soviet communism in the ‘40s and ‘50s. And, for the most part, it wasn’t because they came to realize it was bunk. It was because the state turned on them.
Eventually, the statists turn on their own, because their desire for control is all-encompassing, and because any sign of non-compliance or “disloyalty” must be punished. So, by all means, government Anthropogenicists, come after the cats. I always love seeing lefties pitted against lefties.
And as for me, if you come after my cat, you’ll see my Second Amendment rights in action.
Pictured below: Simon T. Cat, my champion mouser, and my buddy of fifteen years.

You come after my cat, you die. Fair trade in my book. And Simon looks fittingly badass to be associated with this place.
Well if anything will bring the Right and Left together it will be trying to take our cats! Cats kill mice, that’s nature. Why are so many constantly trying to subvert nature?
Here in calif. due to the over abundance of cats in my city, and the apparent over abundance of the “kangeroo rat” in our neighboring communities, I do us all a good deed. I’ve made a hobby of humanely trapping the cats, making sure that they’re healthy, and then I transport and release them in the areas with the largest rat populations. It makes us humans happy, and the cats don’t want for lack of food. Plus, it’s just plain fun.

AdvertisementAt this juncture, we once again encounter a major fork in the road of interpretation where many interpreters insist on understanding the effects of the judgments of the trumpets as being symbolic rather than literal. As we discussed in our treatment of Interpreting Symbols, this leads in the direction of conjecture and supposition out of which it is nearly impossible to obtain an unambiguous understanding of what God intends to reveal. For the reasons before stated, and because of the Golden Rule of Interpretation, we choose to allow the context to determine whether symbolism is in view. When we do, we find that a literal understanding of physical phenomena is most likely in view. upon the earth? What is the difficulty? . . . To explain this away is to manifest a want of faith in the power of God, and in the Word of God. Such things have taken place on earth. Why should they not take place again?1We note the similarity between the judgments found here and the physical, literal judgments which God poured out upon Egypt. Indeed, Isaiah indicates that literal events future to his day would rival those of the Egyptian Exodus::15-16)In the seventh plague which God sent upon the Egyptians on behalf of Israel, God sent hail, and fire mingled with the hail, so very heavy that there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation. This judgment was sent on man, on beast, and on every herb of the field [emphasis added] (Ex. Ex. 9:22-23). Significantly, in the sounding of this angel, the same mix of fire and hail destroys a third of the trees and all the green grass. This includes grain being grown for food (see below). Hail which is sent by God in judgment is often of a great size inflicting severe damage (Jos. Jos. 10:11; Eze. Eze. 13:11; Hag. Hag. 2:17; Rev. Rev. 16:21+). In the seventh bowl judgment, the hail weighs one talent (Rev. Rev. 16:21+)ranging between 75 to 88 pounds.2 The hail is drawn from Gods treasury of hail . . . reserved for the day of battle and war (Job Job 38:22). Under the Law of Moses, the penalty for blasphemy and idolatry was stoning (Lev. Lev. 24:14-16; Deu. Deu. 13:6-10; Deu. 17:2-5). During the Tribulation period, the earth dwellers continue in blasphemy and idolatry. Perhaps this explains why God stones them with large hailstones (Rev. Rev. 16:21+).
The language is evidently drawn from the plagues of Egypt, five or six out of the ten exactly corresponding: the hail, the fire (Ex. Ex. 9:24), the water turned to blood (Ex. Ex. 7:19), the darkness (Ex. Ex. 10:21), the locusts (Ex. Ex. 10:12), and perhaps the death (Rev. Rev. 9:18+). Judicial retribution in kind characterizes the inflictions of the first four, those elements which had been abused punishing their abusers.3
Hailstorms are normally isolated, yet this will be a hailstorm that will blanket and devastate an area larger than the entire North and South American continents (together they represent 28% of earths land surface). What a fearful storm that will be. This will be the first stroke of Gods scourge, a thunderstorm, or series of thunderstorms, which has no precedent, or anything even mildly approaching it in violence in mans history since the flood.4See The Plagues of Egypt and the Tribulation.
fire
Fire generally speaks of judgment. When John the Baptist spoke to the Pharisees and Sadducees who came to his baptism, he called them a Brood of vipers! and warned them of impending judgment. He spoke of a Coming One who was greater than he who would baptize with the Holy Spirit and fire . Those who repented and turned to God, after the Day of Pentecost, were baptized by Jesus with the Holy Spirit and joined to the Body of Christ (1Cor. 1Cor. 12:13). Those who rejected God would eventually be baptized with fire (Mtt. Mat. 13:41-42). In the context of this baptism, John presented two alternative categories which encompass all men: wheat and chaff: His winnowing fan is in His hand, and He will thoroughly clean out His threshing floor, and gather His wheat into the barn; but He will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire [emphasis added] (Mtt. Mat. 3:12). Here, the earth dwellers get their first taste of Gods judging fire which ultimately culminates in the Lake of Fire (Rev. Rev. 19:20+; Rev. 20:14-15+).
mingled with blood
Mingled is μεμιγμένα [memigmena] , perfect tense: having been mingled. The perfect tense indicates an inseparable mix.5 As in the Egyptian judgments, blood is included in the concoction thrown to the earth. Joel predicted this day: And I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth: blood and fire and pillars of smoke (Joel Joel 2:30). All three of these elements are present in this event as the blood is mingled with the hail and the fire causes the green grass and trees to burn generating huge plumes (pillars) of smoke.6
thrown to the earth
This is the first judgment specifically targeted at the destruction of life-supporting natural systems on the planet. Even now, those who reject God worship the creature rather than the Creator (Rom. Rom. 1:25). At the time of the end, God will set about destroying this idol of the earth dwellers.
People today are very concerned about saving the environment. Fears about the depletion of the ozone layer, pollution, the destruction of the rain forests, and global warming are constantly in the news. There is a passionate concern to save endangered species, everything from whales to spotted owls to California condors, and a host of lesser-known species. For many, protecting the environment has become far more than a concern for health and safety; it has become an issue of idolatry, as they worship Mother Nature by trying to protect and perpetuate the earth. . . . Fallen mankind has failed to recognize and honor God as Creator, choosing instead to make a god out of the earth. But the environmental, evolutionary pantheism that devalues man, elevates animals and plants, and ignores the Creator will be severely judged. Earth Day that year will be a gloomy and dismal affair; in a scorched and ravaged world there will be little of the environment left to celebrate.7These are the judgments which the 144,000 Israelites were sealed for protection from. See commentary on Revelation 7:1.
a third
In each of the trumpet judgments which result in death, a third of the population receiving the judgment perishes. A third of the trees is burned up here, a third of the earth is burned up (Rev. Rev. 8:7+, MT and NU text), a third of the sea becomes blood (Rev. Rev. 8:8+), a third of the sea creatures and ships are destroyed (Rev. Rev. 8:9+), a third of the rivers is polluted (Rev. Rev. 8:10-11+), a third of the sunlight, moonlight, and starlight is affected (Rev. Rev. 8:12+), and a third of mankind is killed (Rev. Rev. 9:15+, Rev. 9:18+).
trees were burned up
This judgment is literal, just as was the similar judgment of Egypt, as recounted by the psalmist: He turned their rain into hail, with lightning throughout their land; he struck down their vines and fig trees and shattered the trees of their country (Ps. Ps. 105:32-33). This would include fruit-bearing trees contributing to conditions of famine. See The Plagues of Egypt and the Tribulation. Rev. 6:5-6+) prophesied a severe famine during which food will be horrendously expensive. Compounding this already severe food shortage will be the destruction of one-third of the earths foliage, a destruction wreaked by hail and fire mixed with blood (Rev. Rev. 8:7+).8 The natural disasters which attend these judgments are a problem for those whose interpretive system requires a previous fulfillment in history. Preterist interpreters attempt to identify this judgment with Roman military tactics during the fall of Jerusalem:
Chilton tries to find a literal fulfillment of Revelation Rev. 8:7+ during the siege of Jerusalem in A.D. 70. He says, Literally, the vegetation of Judea, and especially of Jerusalem, would be destroyed in the Roman scorched-earth methods of warfare. He then quotes a passage from Wars 6:6-8 describing the desolation of Jerusalem and the surrounding countryside caused by war. What Chilton does not say is why the Romans cut down the trees. . . . The Romans cut down the wood in order to build earthworks for the siege of Jerusalem. They didnt burn as part of a scorched earth policy. The actual cutting of the trees stands in marked contrast with the description of the first trumpet judgment.9all green grass
Green is χλωρὸς [chlōros] , the same word which describes the color (pale ) of the horse attending the fourth seal (Rev. Rev. 6:8+). Grass is χόρτος [chortos] which can describe stalks of grain in their early, grass-like stages Mtt. Mat. 13:26; Mark Mark 4:28.10 Thus, this judgment may bring not just environmental destruction, but destroy grain production and contribute to the conditions of famine already initiated by the fourth seal. Joel, in speaking of the locust-induced famine of his day, also speaks of the eschatological Day of the Lord: Joel 1:15-20) [emphasis added]Those who take trees and grass here in a symbolic way encounter a logical inconsistency. If trees represent authorities or governmental powers and grass is generally understood as representing the human race (1Pe. 1Pe. 1:24), then we have the situation where all green grass (humanity) is destroyed, but only one-third of the trees (authorities). Symbolic interpretation leads to a hopeless quagmire of contradictions. For instance, the earth, grass, and trees are symbols of nations and men in the first trumpet (Rev. Rev. 8:7+), but in trumpets 3, 5, and 6 these objects of nature appears side-by-side with men (Rev. Rev. 8:11+; Rev. 9:4+, Rev. 9:15+).11 Purely symbolic interpretations render a wide variety of results here which are typically subjected to great elasticity in order to avoid such contradiction. For example, the green grass is taken as Israel rather than mankind.12 It is much simpler to see these as literal, physical catastrophes which are completely in keeping with the predictions of the character of the Day of the Lord in the OT. The variation in interpretation among those who take these items symbolically is strong evidence against such an understanding:
Elliott says that this first Trumpet denotes the wars of Alaric the Goth and Rhadagaisus the Vandal against the Western Roman Empire. We should never have guessed this ourselves. There is nothing about this or even like it in this Scripture. . . . One says trees mean princes and great men; and grass means mens power and glory (Wordsworth). J. N. Darby says that which is elevated, eminent, lofty is intended by the trees; the young, feeble and aged are meant by the green grass. Wetstein says Trees mean fortified cities; grass unwalled villages. Others say by trees are signified apostles and great doctors; by grass, common Christians (Paralus). Alford holds that it appears rather to indicate a general character of the judgments, than to require any special interpretation in each particular case. To all this we have one simple remark to makeWe prefer to believe Gods own special interpretation of His own judgments, in the plain literal sense of the words.13
To some, the sea is pure doctrine; the mountain, aspiring prelates; the fire, their ambition; the discoloration of the waters, the introduction of false doctrine; the fishes, the lower orders of ecclesiastics and monks; the ships, the bearers of the Gospel. To others, the mountain is Rome; its burning, the conflagration of that city by Alaric; the destruction of the ships, the plunder of its wealth. Still others see in the record, a symbol of the ravages by Attila. And I only wonder that no one has discovered that it denotes the settlement of the Mormons in Salt Lake Territory! The simple truth is, that if it does not mean what it says, as men ordinarily use language, no man can tell what it does mean; and the opinion of one is just as good, and just as bad, as that of another.14A short sample of the varied meanings derived by various symbolic interpreters underscores the subjective nature of the entire approach:15

P. G. Mathew | Sunday, September 20, 2009
What shall we say, then? Is the law sin? Certainly not! - Romans 7:7
Have you ever noticed that all sinners are happy as long as the Holy Spirit is not convicting them through God's law? If you ask such people how they are doing, they will say they are doing just fine. Their marriages are working out splendidly. Their children are studying at top universities. They are doing well at their jobs and their retirement funds are growing. They have no health problems and expect to live long and happy lives. But the truth is, such people are dead men walking. They have no concern about their standing before a holy God.
The rich fool of Luke 12 thought everything was going well for him. But God said to him, "You fool! This very night your life will be demanded of you" (Luke 12:20). There was a time when Saul of Tarsus lived such a carefree, happy life. God was not convicting him of his sins by the application of God's law, so he felt fine. He said that concerning the righteousness of the law, he was perfect (Phil. 3:6). He said, "I was advancing in Judaism beyond many Jews of my own age and was extremely zealous for the traditions of my fathers" (Gal. 1:14). But then he writes, "Apart from law, sin is dead. Once I was alive apart from law; but when the commandment came, sin sprang to life and I died" (Rom. 7:8-9).
In Romans 7:7-13, Paul is vindicating the Mosaic law because up to this point in his epistle he has said many negative things about it. He declared the law cannot justify (Rom. 3:20); the law cannot sanctify (Rom. 7:1-6); the law increases sin (Rom. 5:20; 7:5); that believers are not under law but under grace (Rom. 6:14); that believers have died to law in death of Christ to be united to Jesus Christ so that we can bring forth fruit to God (Rom. 7:4, 6); and that through the law comes knowledge of sin (Rom. 3:20). Paul said that the law cannot restrain or curb sin; in fact, it does the opposite.
Such negative teaching about God's law could prompt a person, especially a first-century Jew, to ask, "What then are you saying? Is God's law sin?" Paul responds, "Certainly not!" Then he goes on to demonstrate the relationship of law to sin and death. Here Paul the Christian is looking at his life before conversion. He is thinking back to the time when the Holy Spirit applied God's law to his heart after his encounter with the risen Christ on the road to Damascus. He may especially be thinking of the three days when, as a blind man, he fasted and prayed in Judas' house on Straight Street in the city of Damascus.
On the Damascus road Paul saw that he totally misunderstood the design and purpose of God's law. He realized that it was false way of salvation. He began to see that God designed the law so that through its application, sin might become so utterly sinful and foul that man might turn to Christ alone for salvation.
The law was given to unmask sin so that it may be shown in its true color of utter deception, destruction, and foulness. When the Holy Spirit applies the law to a sinner and convicts him of sin, he cries out, "I am all unrighteousness. Have mercy upon me, a sinner! I am a wretch. I am blind. I am lost. I am dead." Professor Leon Morris comments that God's law is not given to boost our self-esteem but to bust it.1 So Paul is speaking from the standpoint of a convinced Christian, telling us from his own experience what happens to any sinner who is confronted with the law. Only in the light of God's law does one see sin as an offense against God himself.
The Nature and Function of God's Moral Law
What, then, is the nature and function of God's moral law? Paul was aware of the fact of sin but he was not aware of its real nature and power until the Holy Spirit convicted him through the law, cutting him to the heart especially by the tenth commandment: "Thou shalt not covet."
Most first-century Jews thought that only outward deeds like adultery and murder were sin, not inward attitudes like lust and anger. But the tenth commandment says evil lust itself is sin, as Jesus explained: "You have heard that it was said, 'Do not commit adultery.' But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart" (Matt. 5:27-28).
1. The law shows that we commit sin by transgressing God's law.
When we have an evil desire for things belonging to another or things that are evil, we are transgressing the tenth commandment. We are sinning in our heart against God, and God knows our heart. This evil lust shows that our rebellion is against God himself because it is saying that we are not content with what God ordained for us. Instead, we want to grasp and possess what is not given to us. We become greedy and self-focused, a perversion that is the opposite of love. Our lack of contentment in God is the very heart of worldliness. We think that the things of the world will make us happier than God and his presence.
The tenth commandment destroyed Paul's self-righteousness. He had to admit that he lusted sinfully countless times, though he never stole, murdered, or committed adultery. Once he thought he was blameless, but now he was convinced that he was blameful. The law revealed that he was a sinner who had committed a multitude of sins in his heart. Yet the law is not sin. The law reveals our sin nature and our many sins. It is a reagent that identifies the very presence of sin.
2. The law provokes sin, functioning as a catalyst so that we sin more.
Sin, through the law, creates a surge of rebellion in our hearts against God and his agents. Sin is enmity toward God; thus, a sinner is an enemy of God. Our sin nature twists God's law so that we sin more. In this sense, God's law stimulates sin.
When St. Augustine was sixteen years old, he and his friends went to his neighbor's field at night, shook a pear tree, and stole all the pears. Later on, he analyzed why he stole. He was not hungry and he had lots of pears at home. In fact, he threw the stolen pears to the pigs. Why then did he steal the neighbor's pears? He answers: "To enjoy the excitement and thrill of stealing, because God said, 'Do not steal.'" The commandment "Do not steal" provokes stealing due to our sin nature. Sin twists God's law and uses it for evil purposes.
We have seen this in our children. We say, "Do not do it," and they want to do the forbidden action immediately and repeatedly. Then we direct them to do something, and they will not do it at all. Our sin nature is real and God's law stimulates us to sin.
3. The law condemns sin (Rom. 7:9-11).
Paul says, "Once I was alive apart from law; but when the commandment came, sin sprang to life and I died." (Rom. 7:9). It is like a person going to the doctor for a routine check-up, feeling very happy and seeming to have no problems. But all of a sudden the doctor says seriously: "You have terminal cancer." That is the idea here.
Paul was happy outside of the law. He thought he had no problem at all. He thought he was righteous, pleasing God and keeping the law. He would say that he was doing just fine. But then the Great Physician confronted him with the law and revealed his serious problem. So he says, "When the law came, sin revived and I died."
How many people are dead spiritually while they think they are fine! Yet God in his mercy tells us about our state through the gospel preaching. That is why many people will not go to a church where the whole Bible is preached because God uses the preaching of the law to bring conviction of sin.
At one time Paul, like the Pharisee and the rich young ruler of Luke 18, thought he was living a righteous life. He had no need of a Savior or atonement; he was "perfect." But the Holy Spirit through the law cut Paul's heart and convicted him of his sin. No longer alive in his self-esteem, self-righteousness, and self-approbation, he died and became all unrighteousness. Once he felt very righteous, though he was killing Christians. Now he realized what a wretched sinner he was.
Listen to Paul's evaluation of himself when the Holy Spirit came upon him:)
The law, therefore, is the straightedge that shows how crooked our heart is. In Acts 2:37 we read, "When the people heard this, they were cut to the heart and said to Peter and the other apostles, 'Brothers, what shall we do?'" Jesus himself declared, "When [the Holy Spirit] comes, he will convict the world of guilt in regard to sin and righteousness and judgment" (John 16:8). When Nathan confronted David, saying, "You are the man!" David confessed to Nathan, "I have sinned against the LORD" (2 Sam. 12:7, 13).
When God is not working in our hearts through his law and convicting us, we can be happy. Once Paul felt that way. But when the law came home to him, he died. The law condemned him and he cried out, "Have mercy upon me, a sinner!" The law was God's way of bringing sin to a head before its power was broken by the stronger grace of God.
Once when Professor John Gerstner was preaching in a church, a sophisticated woman came up to him at the end of his sermon and showed him her index finger and thumb half an inch apart. She said, "You made me feel like this much." Dr. Gerstner said, "That is much too much. It will take you to hell." We must see how sinful we truly are.
4. The law strengthens sin.
"The sting of death is sin; the power of sin is the law. But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through Jesus Christ our Lord," (1 Cor. 15:56). The law cannot break the power of sin. A legalist who depends on the law to justify and sanctify him can only sin, because in a sinner, the law gives power to sin. Every time he hears, "Do not fornicate," he wants to fornicate and he does so. We need the Holy Spirit and need to be born again to break the power of sin. The law gives power to sin. More dependence on law means more sin, which means more guilt and more condemnation. But thanks be to God who gives us the victory through Jesus Christ our Lord by his death and resurrection! Through Christ, therefore, we die to sin and law. Set free from sin and law, we are united to Christ, saved forever by his life. Only then, by the power of the Spirit, can we delight in God's law and bring forth fruit to God.
5. The law points us to Christ.
Paul says, "Christ is the end of the law so that there may be righteousness for everyone who believes" (Rom. 10:4). Elsewhere, he declares, "What, then, was the purpose of the law? It was added [to define] transgressions until the Seed to whom the promise referred had come. The law was put into effect through angels by a mediator" (Gal. 3:19). He adds, "So the law was put in charge to lead us to Christ that we might be justified by faith" (Gal. 3:24). The law only condemns and kills us. It destroys our self-esteem and self-righteousness, that we may look to Christ to justify, sanctify, and glorify us through his death and resurrection. The law kills so that Christ may raise us up from the dead.
6. For God's people, the law reveals God's will so that we may do it.
Paul).
God does not use our subjectivism to define sin. We must measure ourselves in the light of the objective standard of God's law. For a believer, the law tells us what pleases God so that we may do it by the power of the Holy Spirit. A believer is born again. He is given a new heart and a new nature, and is indwelt by the Holy Spirit. No longer hating God's law, he delights in it and meditates on it. He does the law and glorifies God by doing all things to the glory of God.
Through the power of the love of God shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit, we fulfill the law. A sinner is lawless because sin is lawlessness, but a believer is lawful. He is not an anti-nomian; he is pro-nomian. Love fulfills the law. Jesus said, "If you love me, keep my commandments."
7. The law was never intended to save us.
Paul refers to this common misunderstanding in verse 10: "I found that the very commandment that was 'intended to bring life' actually brought death" (quotation marks added). Note the phrase: "intended to bring life." It was the understanding of Judaism that people could be justified through the law. But it was never given to save us. So Paul says, "Therefore no one will be declared righteous in his sight by observing the law; rather, through the law we become conscious of sin" (Rom. 3:20). Then he says, "The law was added so that the trespass might increase" (Rom. 5:20). He writes, "For what the law was powerless to do in that it was weakened by the sinful nature, God did by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful man to be a sin offering. And so he condemned sin in sinful man" (Rom. 8:3). Again he writes, "Is the law, therefore, opposed to the promises of God? Absolutely not! For if a law had been given that could impart life, then righteousness would certainly have come by the law" (Gal. 3:21). The truth is, the law was not given to impart life.
The Nature and Function of Sin
Having discussed the nature and function of the law, let us now look at the nature and function of sin. All children of Adam are born with sin nature. We are born enemies of God; our very thoughts and imaginations are against God. Dead in trespasses and sins, we are ruled by Satan, the spirit who now works in the sons of disobedience. We can only sin every day of our lives.
When such a sinner is given law by parents, teachers, police, or pastors, the sin in him takes advantage of the law to produce many sins, even sins he had not thought about. (PGM) The sin that is resident in us uses law as a base of military operation within our souls. So Paul sinned much against God, especially in terms of the tenth commandment: Do not covet.
Sin is extremely powerful. Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones says that next to God, sin is the greatest power in the universe. Only the grace of God can defeat and conquer sin's great power. In this epistle Paul speaks of sin as a king with great power and authority. He writes, "So that, just as sin reigned in death, so also grace might reign through righteousness to bring eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord" (Rom. 5:21). In Romans 6 he exhorts, "Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its evil desires. . . ." (Rom. 6:12, 14, 16-17).
We find this idea of the powerfulness of sin throughout the Bible. In Genesis 4:7 the Lord told Cain, "If you do what is right, will you not be accepted? But if you do not do what is right, sin is crouching at your door; it desires to have you, but you must master it." Jeremiah declares, "The heart is deceitful above all things and beyond cure. Who can understand it?" (Jer. 17:9). And Jesus taught, ).
Not only is sin powerful, but it is also ever-active. There is no Sabbath-rest for sin. It works hard day and night, from the time we are very young to when we are very old. Sin works hard even when we worship. Sin is active because the devil is active. He goes about as a roaring lion, seeking to devour especially and if possible God's elect. If you feel angry as you hear the gospel preached, sin is working in your heart. But if the Holy Spirit is working in your heart, you will say to the preacher, "Amen," meaning, "What you are saying is the truth."
Sin works in us through our own evil lust. Lust is the root; fornication is the fruit. Lust is the root; stealing is the fruit. Lust is the root; adultery is the fruit. Lust is the root; murder is the fruit. First there is attitude, then action. This is why we need a new heart and the Holy Spirit so we can love God and do his will. Eve lusted first and ate the forbidden fruit. Achan lusted and stole. Ahab lusted and took Naboth's vineyard by killing him. David lusted and took Bathsheba. Amnon lusted and raped Tamar. Judas lusted and sold Jesus for thirty pieces of silver. Demas lusted and abandoned Paul and the gospel for this world. Lust is the root; the specific sin is the fruit.
Sin cannot be cured by education or political or economic or scientific progress. Modern man hates the word "sin." He says that man is born good and is getting better all the time. Yet this highly educated and civilized man is responsible for killing millions of people in wars, and in our country alone we have killed fifty million unborn children through abortion since 1973. Sophisticated, educated, civilized, rich people can be wicked murderers. They can violate every commandment. They hate the Bible, the God of the Bible, and anyone who preaches the Bible. That is why they get angry at a minister who preaches the gospel. Their anger shows the hardness of the human heart. They do not like it when we speak about sin and how we should practice righteousness. Above all, they hate Jesus Christ. Such nice, civilized, sophisticated people hate the moral model given in the Bible. They love the medical model that came out of evolutionary hypothesis and naturalism. So they will not call people sinners but patients.
Sin uses the bait of pleasure and thrill. Sin is a good fisherman. It shows us pleasure but hides the death that results from sin. There is pleasure in sin and we sin because we want pleasure. The Hebrews writer recognized this aspect of sin when he said Moses "chose to be mistreated along with the people of God rather than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a short time" (Heb. 11:25). How many people have been deceived by the thrill, the pleasure, the excitement of sin! But then they crash to the ground, having ruined their lives through sin.
Sin kills its victims. Paul writes, "So that, just as sin reigned in death, so also grace might reign through righteousness to bring eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord" (Rom. 5:21). Sin reigns in death. The wages of sin is death. No one sends a person to hell; people work every day of their lives to go there, and they will go there.
Sin totally deceives man. In Genesis 3:4-5 we read, "'You will not surely die,' the serpent said to the woman. 'For God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.'" This was pure lie. Yet how many people have listened to such lie and sinned! Look at verse 13: "Then the LORD God said to the woman, 'What is this you have done?' The woman said, 'The serpent deceived me, and I ate.'" Paul writes, "You were taught, with regard to your former way of life, to put off your old self, which is being corrupted by its deceitful desires" (Eph. 4:22). The Hebrews writer says, "But encourage one another daily as long as it is called Today so that none of you be hardened by sin's deceitfulness" (Heb. 3:13). Paul also writes,:7-10)
The antichrist is called the lawless one. There are people who call themselves Christians, yet they live like the lawless one. Such people are not Christians. Deceived by sin and Satan, they will perish.
Sin deceives us in many ways, including the following:2
Sin misuses the law. The law must be used lawfully. Paul says, "We know that the law is good if one uses it properly" (1 Tim. 1:8). The law cannot justify or sanctify us. It reveals sin to us, and if we are God's people, it reveals God's will so we can do it. But sin misuses the law by saying lust is permissible as long as one does not sin outwardly. It says that evil intentions are not sin and God does not judge evil desire.
Sin comes and says, "Because you sinned once and broke the law, you are hopeless. You might as well keep on sinning. More sins make no difference."
Sin encourages antinomianism, which says that we should not be troubled when we sin because we are saved by grace from first to last. It says, "Once saved, always saved, so it does not matter whether we sin or not. In fact, we can bring greater glory to God by sinning more because where sin abounded, grace superabounds. More sin equals more grace equals more glory to God." This is the message of modern evangelicalism. Dr. Lloyd-Jones says, "Antinomianism is one of the most blinding curses that have ever afflicted the life of the Church."3 People want pastors to champion antinomianism.
Sin deceives us by creating within us an antagonism to the law, saying God is against us. Sin says God does not want us to have fun; that is why he prohibits us from doing certain things. It says if God were for us, he would let us do what we want.
Sin says God's law is unreasonable, unjust, and impossible.
Sin deceives us into thinking very highly of ourselves.
Sin says God's law is oppressive, keeping us from developing into a god without needing law. God does not like competition.
Sin deceives about itself. Sin makes sin very attractive and pleasurable. Sin says, "If it feels good, do it. Express yourself."
Sin makes righteousness look drab and unattractive. It says an obedient son is a mere dullard; a rebellious son is a lively and exciting person.
Sin deceives us into overlooking the terrible, eternal consequences it brings to our own bodies and souls and to those of our children and children's children for generations to come. Do we think about such long-term effects when we sin? Sin results in terrible consequences, including the final consequence of hell itself. But sin says, "You shall not surely die."
Sin deceives us into thinking, "I have kept the law perfectly. I am perfect. My pastor, my parents, and others have no clue about my perfection. Why are they so upset about my behavior?"
Sin promises life but gives death. It promises happiness but gives misery. Sin promises divinity but makes us a demon. Sin promises holiness but gives corruption.
Is the Law Sin?
Is God's law sin? Paul explains the true nature of God's law: "The law is holy, and the commandment is holy, righteous and good" (Rom. 7:12). God's law is holy. It is the absolute antithesis of evil. God is holy; so his law is holy. It is also righteous. Sin tells us that the law's demands are unjust and unfair. But the law's demands are just. A criminal is put to death for his crime, not because of unjust law. Finally, God's law is good. The law tells us that God alone is good and so his law is good and good for us. A good life is a life lived in conformity with the law of God. The life of Jesus was the good life. Law is not evil. It is not the cause of sin and death. Sin is the cause of sin and death.
What, then, is the divine design and intention of giving us the law? Paul explains that God gave the law so that sin may be unmasked (Rom. 7:13). The nature of sin is deception, so God uses his law to expose sin that it may be recognized for what it is-utterly foul. Sin is stench in the nostrils of God. It is destructive and can only send us to hell.
The law reveals sin as utterly sinful so that we will hate sin with all our being. Jesus exposed Satan when he said, "The thief comes to steal, kill, and destroy." Sin comes to steal, kill, and destroy us. "But I have come," Jesus said, "that you may have life and that more abundantly" (John 10:10). The devil is a liar and the father of all lies.
Application
The law is not sin; rather, it reveals and unmasks sin. We must therefore preach the law so that the Holy Spirit may convict sinners of their sin that they may turn to Jesus. Jesus saves only sinners who are convinced of their utter sinfulness.
Examine yourself. What is your reaction to a holy God who is Judge? What is your reaction to the preaching of the cross? What is your reaction to the Lord Jesus Christ? What is your reaction to the Bible? Is it hatred or delight? The first sign of spirituality is to feel dead, unclean, and lost.
This doctrine of sin and law is absolutely essential to understanding the gospel. That is why we preach the whole Bible. We cannot merely say, "God forgives you" or "God saves you." What does he forgive? From what does he save us? When we preach God's law, the Holy Spirit convicts us of our sin that we may turn to Christ and be saved.
The law cannot justify or sanctify. We are saved from sin's penalty, power, and pollution only by the blood of Jesus applied to us by Holy Spirit. Therefore, if you are looking for a church, choose one where God's entire word-law and gospel-is fully preached. Avoid churches that preach antinomian forgiveness; it will only encourage sin.
May God help us to welcome light and the brightness of light of God's word. Once we were in darkness but now we are light in the Lord. May we live as children of light!

Without those, usually I find myself starting to gradually lose the ability to cope with the “smaller” things in life.
Usually if I am around people where I feel like I have to be “sociable” or maintain a social front, I tend to be given easier to fatigue than if I’m by myself or around people where I feel like I can truly be “myself.” If situations like this continue for days at a time with little rest, I tend to have too little time in order to process all of the stimuli and I start doing and saying strange things. If I am not doing strange things then I am being excessively quiet and that tends to confuse people and draws an unnecessary amount of attention to me.
Also, during times of strange emotional crises I find that I need to retreat to quiet places in order to first deal with things internally. I am also the type of person who needs to speak with people and seek advice, but it unfortunately needs to be in my own timing. If I feel forced into talking or I feel that it isn’t the appropriate time, I just simply won’t have my thoughts sorted out and won’t be able to say much. It actually does me more harm than good to talk about things when I’m not ready.
This past week was what could be referred to as a “perfect storm.” It was filled with an “emotional crisis” at the head of the week which lead into non-stop social-ness each day of the week with minimal thinking-recharge time. Unfortunately today and tomorrow will also be the same type of crazy-social days. Then there is also the associated anxiety that comes with the territory of needing a good recharge.
Although I would rather not, I may have to adjust my schedule a bit so I’m much more antisocial this coming week. Usually I only require one good day to be alone to recharge when I’m at my worst moments, but I will have to make that judgment call tomorrow. I must admit, it is slightly annoying needing “recharge time” as often as I do. I guess that just proves that I am not a superhero and like everybody else, I require periods of “rest.”Landon "Tex" Chase from "Southern Nights" stars in the CMT reality series.

Speaking at the launch of the C.V. Raman International Fellowship for African Researchers 2013, Arabinda Mitra, Head-International Cooperation (Bilateral), Department of Science & Technology, said since its beginning in 2010, the programme has benefitted more than 300 African scientists and researchers.
"The first year of the programme (2010-11) attracted 135 applications from 28 African countries, out of which 86 were selected, while in the 2011-12, 78 of the 122 applications were selected," said Mitra.
"The third year of the programme saw a steady increase in the number of applicants as we received 400, of which 149 have been selected," he said.
The programme is intended to strengthen scientific cooperation between India and Africa by providing fellowships to African researchers for undertaking advanced scientific work in leading Indian institutions, laboratories and research centers.
Ravi Bangar, joint secretary (East & South Africa) in the external affairs ministry, called upon African Union nations that have not availed the fellowship to encourage their researchers to apply for it.
"I will request Angola, Democratic Republic of Congo, Republic of Congo, Namibia, Lesotho and the Seychelles to encourage students to avail the fellowship," said Bangar.
All fields of natural sciences, including mathematics and statistics, engineering sciences and medical sciences, are covered under the programme with the exception of humanities and behavioral sciences.
"The programme aims to provide an opportunity for enhanced capacity building of African researchers and creating avenues for partnerships and future collaboration among research and academic institutions of both the regions," said Nirankar Saxena, senior director, science and technology/innovation, FICCI.
Micky Lova, a recipient of the fellowship from Madagascar, said it has been a great experience and excellent opportunity to study in India.
"Collaboration between India and Africa is of mutual interest and it has been a great experience to work with Indian scholars and professors," said the PhD scholar studying in the geology department of Delhi University.
The programme is offered at three levels - post-doctoral fellowship (six months), visiting fellowship (three months) and senior fellowship (one month).
The function was attended by several African ambassadors to India, officials of the department of science and technology and professors of various universities.

Two people that are supposedly perfect for each other and meant to be together forever.
But for people who actually have a brain, the idea of "soul mates" is ridiculous. There are certain people who are right for you at certain times in your life. There isn't ONE person who you are always supposed to be with forever.

I thought my now ex boyfriend and I were soul mates. Then I grew a brain and realized that maybe we were meant to be with each other at that time in our lives, but as time changes so do peoples feelings. And neither of us feel the same way about each other anymore.

what....In states like California, in which unions are entitled by law to workers' money whether the workers want union membership or not, labor unions can do whatever they want. In a right-to-work state like Michigan, the labor union has to earn those dollars by providing a service that members and potential members see as useful. Which sounds more reasonable to you?.
4 comments:
The unions have to earn their dues? Uh, maybe at some future time but right now, and for some years to come, not so much.
A number of school districts have "negotiated" contracts in which RTW is effectively nullified. One of the loopholes in the law is that contracts negotiated before the law went into effect were exempt from its constraints.
Since in a pretty fair number of districts the sainted "local control" means union control those districts renegotiated their contracts to lock members in to mandatory dues for five years, the limit on contract length.
So five years from now teachers in those districts might be able to exercise some choice over their membership in the local but for five years they can go pound sand as far as the local's concerned.
That's an issue in at least one of the lawsuits.
a month is not brief. And, once again, you fail to understand what makes unions work. There is a reason that predominately non-union teachers at private schools make less than union teachers at public schools.
A month is brief. And it's only a month because the union couldn't make it zero. The essence of unions is coercion and coercion becomes tougher when you victim has an escape route.
Of course there's a reason union teachers make more then non-union - non-union teachers don't have the power to coerce a settlement.
By the logic of unions if muggers had enough political influence they could get law passed legalizing their "trade".
Oh, and inasmuch as there's no honor among thieves one would expect, and history has shown is justified in the expectation, that union officials screw union members only slightly less then they screw the public in general. More if they can get away with it for long enough.PUNXSUTAWNEY, Pa. — The club that organizes Pennsylvania’s world-renowned Groundhog Day celebration is working to improve Gobbler’s Knob, the tiny hill on which the celebration takes place each Feb. 2.

- In younger years we could date men of all ages, while the boys were pretty much stuck with girls their own age or younger. The rules are different now, and we have to accept it.
- Take stock of your appearance. Walk more, eat more raw fruits and vegetables, get your colors done or get a makeover. Simplify your grooming.
- Makes friends with the aging process. Don’t lie about your age. Work with it.
- Do something nice for yourself several times a week: take a bubble bath with candles and with Haydn playing in the background, buy fresh flowers, etc.
- Join a group you like which is unrelated to your work or your friends.
- Take a course. Anything that appeals–from 1001 Uses of Tofu to Medieval History. Do this once or twice a year.
- If a man you like develops an interest in you, let him make most of the moves. Don’t figure on snaring him and making him over, either.
- Give up the attitude that male company is an entitlement.
A Denver Reader
Dear Denver Reader: Thanks for your well thought through recommendations. Women, do you have anything to add to this list?
Dear Neil: I have some advice to the middle-aged female who recently wrote to you saying that since gaining weight she has become invisible to men.
The real reason for her problem with men is her weight, and it is totally within her control to lose that weight. I don’t believe she has to do anything else. I am disappointed with your advice to her, because you did not address the real issue.
Pointing Out in Point Edward, Ontario, Canada
Dear Neil: His experience is similar to that of most women. Women do most of the childrearing, cleaning, shopping, cooking, laundry, car pools and driving to doctor’s appointments, just to name a few things. Many of these women work full time, and their husbands still will not help. Study after study shows that most men do not pull their share of the load.
I enjoyed seeing it happen to a man!
Pleased in Littleton, Colorado
Dear Pleased: Although I understand the frustration and sense of unfairness you expressed, it is useful to remember that unfairness to anyone–men or women–is still unfair. It was Gandhi who said that an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth just leaves the whole world blind and toothless.
Any person that leaves their mate with too much of the load is creating an unfair burden for the other, and sooner or later is going to get a lot of anger and hostility back. Look for how you could be part of the solution with men in your life, and make sure you’re not inadvertently perpetuating the problem.

Wow, I’m responding to the mists of time. Nevertheless:
Yes, I have some advice for this hypothetical middle-aged woman.
First: Are you absolutely sure you’re in the market for a man? And I mean a real, what-actually-exists-out-there man, not a romance fantasy? Because my guess is you got used to thinking “I need a boyfriend” back when you were a girl, and you didn’t know how capable and interesting you were, and you didn’t know how men were likely to behave and likely to treat you.
Consider you usual middle-aged single guy who’s out looking: Scratch that surface, and he’s a humiliated, angry person. If he was married, he doesn’t really understand why the wonderful marriage he was supposed to have didn’t drop itself on his head. His colleagues have wives, but he’s the fuckup with no woman making things nice in his life. If he’s never been married, he feels daily like an inferior freak. He seriously doesn’t like this and he takes it very personally. He’s pretty sure he’s getting a raw deal and that he was owed a better life. Mostly though he’s humiliated in front of family-type head-of-household guys, which makes him pretty angry at women for giving it to that guy, who’s a jerk, and not him.
He’s lately been thinking he’s entitled to live all the sexual fantasies he’s ever had. When he goes to dinner with you, he will be imagining doing some truly fucked things to you. He saw them in porn videos. He assumes he should at least be able to bang you in the ass because, again, as far as he can make out, everyone gets to but him.
He really won’t like it if you’re actually self-sufficient. He wants that shot at shining-knighthood, and if you’re self-sufficient, then that blows that whole deal. You shouldn’t want his money, though.
He doesn’t really want you to be energetic or all that interested in things that require energy, either, because he’s tired and doesn’t want to feel like he has to start chasing around and doing a lot of stuff on a regular basis.
The odds that he will decide that you’re not living up to his standards, lookswise, are pretty tremendous, because he really is still, deep down, hoping for that 23-year-old.
He probably doesn’t manage his life nearly as well as you manage yours. You might have kids, you may have spent a decade or so raising them while working and managing community things. You really know how to run a ship, take care of money, etc. He lives like he’s 25. This fact will translate, in his mind, to your being a ballbuster and making him feel bad on purpose. He’s also lying about how well he cooks.
And…well…sometimes he’s gonna have trouble in bed, and at that point the entire session’s going to be about his penis. You will not be able to distract him from the failure of his penis. The agony will go on and on. It will not be sexy. Nor will you feel polite saying “excuse me” and wandering off to another room with a toy or two.
We haven’t yet discussed his work. You’d better hope he’s got some and that it’s going well. Not because of the money, but because he’ll be *unbearable* if his work’s going poorly or he’s unemployed. It’s all a reflection on him, and you will not be able to pull him away from staring at the image of Self as Loser.
If, after all that, you really want a man, go and god bless, and I hope you get one who’s unusual and mature and not at all like the above. But I would still suggest looking around and seeing what else you already have in your life that you adore, and…not setting your expectations too high. I’m sorry.- Owner:

In 1988, the Simpson escorted oil tankers during the Iran-Iraq War.
On April 18, 1988 it participated in the destruction of Iranian naval and intelligence facilities on an oil platform in the Persian Gulf. Later that day the Simpson, along with the USS Wainwright and USS Bagley encountered the Iranian missile patrol boat Joshan which fired a Harpoon missile at the American ships which returned missile fire and sank the Iranian ship.
The other two ships were decommissioned before the Simpson which makes it the last U.S. ship to sink an enemy ship in combat (other than the USS Constitution, of course).
In 1990 it rescued 22 crew members of the tanker Surf City after it exploded.
Captain Gerald F. DeConto commanded the Simpson from September 1998 to April 2000. He was killed at the Pentagon on 9-11.
The Simpson was the last ship of its class in service. I was unable to find out if a foreign country has bought the ship or not.

I’ve been studying her work, learning about her environmental design business and just marveling in the brilliant glow of her creativity. Audra sees inspiration in the most unique places.
For instance, her handmade Dangle Notch earrings. Fallingwater, Frank Lloyd Wright’s iconic house located in southwest Pennsylvania, served as the inspiration for these sculptural steel earrings. What’s inspiring to me is that Audra could see the notched trellis and then conceive such a simplistic and yet perfect pair of earrings.
Audra pulls inspiration from the steel bridges in Pittsburg, Pennsylvania. Who knew that there are 446 bridges in Pittsburg? For an artist like Audra, that’s a lot of structural elements to be inspired by. To me, this is exactly what it means to be a handmaker. Like the Handmaker Manifesto says: Our imagination is our canvas.
Can’t choose one single piece? Why not grab the LOADED bracelet? It features all 9 of Audra’s Steel Town charms. It’s pretty impressive. You can do the same with her necklace.

Guestbook comments2 years ago, I purchased a Corvette Yellow Modulus Quantum 6 string Fretless Bass, with the "f" hole on the body that is out this world. I paid $1200 Bucks for it used, and it was money well spent. The condition was so excellent that I thought that Pawn Shop that I got it from manufactured it.
Not a Scratch on it. The Neck is the famous Modulus Graphite neck, and the contour of the neck makes it very easy to play. And the color is bright Corvette Yellow, and when I play out, it stands out very well, as well as the sound. I have another 6 String Bass, which is an Alvarez Bass, but the Modulus is Paradise.Since the Bass is Fretless, I have to pay more attention to the neck to stay in tune when I'm playing, but that goes with any Fretless Bass, so no big deal. Other than that, there is nothing that I can say that I don't like about the Bass.
The Craftmanship is so precise, and since there are no Frets, there is no Fret buzz.
The Strings are the origional Strings that were on the Bass since I first purchased it back in January 2001, and the Strings sound like brand new, No kidding.
It has an Awsome sound that I like so much.
What is really funny about the Bass is that there are fret lines on the neck, but it's fretless. When I tell people that it's fretless, they don't believe me until I slide my hands up and down the neck, and they hear how smooth the tone up and down, without hearing any frets.
It really fools people. Fret lines are not Frets.
One Day I went to Mars Music before they went out of Business of Course, and the Modulus Basses that they sell don't have the "f" hole on the body, and mine does, and Mars Music price tag for their Modulus Basses started at $2500 Dollars, where my Modulus that I picked up at a Pawn Shop is Corvette Yellow, which is very rare for Modulus, unless you have it custom painted your color you desire, also My Modulus Bass has the "f" hole, and only for $1200 Bucks.
The workers at Mars Music said WHERE DID YOU GET THAT BASS FROM!! Told them it's a secret. I am a happy camper.
God Bless Modulus Basses.
� Gear Review Network / MusicGearReview.com - 2000Denny Heck And Dick Muri Seek New 10th Congressional Seat.
It’s a district that Republicans complain was made-to-order for Democratic legislator and businessman Denny Heck. But Republican consultant Alex Hays also says that the district is more competitive than Democrats would like.
“The balance of the population is in Pierce County. It has a very high population of military and veteran voters, and is probably closer to being a centrist district than the Democrats hoped they were drawing for Denny Heck,” Hays said.
Campaign contributions do not indicate a swing district, however. Heck has raised $1.8 million, the most of any congressional candidate in the state except 1st District Democrat Suzan DelBene. It’s several times the amount his opponent, Dick Muri, has brought in.
Heck may have the lion’s share of contributions, but he says he’s not taking anything for granted. He previously served as a legislator and chief of staff to Governor Booth Gardner. He also founded the state’s public affairs network, TVW, and was an early investor in the company RealNetworks.
Heck says there’s no silver bullet to help the nation’s economy, but his focus if elected would be to invest in infrastructure and education. “Congress has a role in this,” he said. “That role is not doubling student loan rates. That role is not slashing Pell grants, both of which were at risk of happening just this last summer.”
Heck says the housing sector has always been key to economic recovery, and Congress needs to give it renewed attention. To that end, he’d press government sponsored institutions like Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae to stop home foreclosures. “I think that we should be more aggressive about refinancing existing mortgages through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and the reason why is it will put more disposable income in peoples’ pockets,” Heck said.
Heck points to an abandoned house in his own neighborhood as the kind of thing that holds the economy back. “My wife went down there and weeded the lawn, just to try and have some semblance of being occupied,” he said.
Heck’s name lends itself to earnest posters that say, “Give Congress Heck!” But he also has an artistic side – he’s the author of a mystery novel, he did a documentary about the state Supreme Court that won a regional Emmy award, and he wrote a one-man play on Washington state history that he performed to raise money for charity. But Heck declines to provide the script and said he won’t be reviving the elderly character he played onstage anytime soon. “Lots of make-up every night,” he recalled. “I’m not doing that again, let me tell you. Theater grease, no thank you!”
The background of Heck’s opponent, Republican Dick Muri, perhaps exemplifies the northern, military part of the new congressional district, just as Heck’s reflects the Olympia region. Muri lives in Steilacoom. He retired as a lieutenant colonel in the Air Force after 14 years at Joint Base Lewis-McChord. He spent seven years on his local school board and has served nine years on the Pierce County Council. Muri is a fiscal conservative who says his goal if elected would be to shrink federal government.
“I’ve been listening on the radio to the Big Bird debate,” Muri said.”It really comes down to, at what point does everybody get subsidized? We need to realize that once we get a government program in place, it’s not supposed to be there forever. We need to let the private sector and the nonprofit sector somehow manage without being on the federal dole.”
Muri said he was nicknamed “Council Member ‘No’” on the Pierce County Council for his reluctance to spend money – even what he calls “other people’s money.” He said a recent federal grant to the county illustrates the problem.
“So here we got $1.3 million dollars coming from the federal government to buy an airplane for our sheriff to replace the old airplane. Well, isn’t that nice?” Muri said. “But where’d the federal government get the money? They went and borrowed it.”
Muri knows his philosophy might be a tough sell in such a government-dependent district. But he said as a veteran he’s willing to advocate for his fellow service members in District 10. Muri said the armed forces should still be a top priority of the federal government. But he said even military spending could be reduced, as long as it’s not “on the backs” of current forces.
Their differing takes on state ballot initiatives help contrast Heck and Muri even further. Heck has specifically endorsed just one ballot measure: Referendum 74 to allow marriage of same-sex couples. He said, “I think that’s a basic civil right that’s about to arrive, and I believe we shouldn’t discriminate against people who want to enter into long-term committed relationships.”
In contrast, Muri says he and everyone he knows in his local Catholic church will be voting against same-sex marriage. “The pastor’s been very clear about how this is not something this country needs or the state needs,” Muri said. “Traditional marriage has been there since the start of time and we should protect it.”
But on Initiative 502 to legalize marijuana possession in Washington, Muri has gone farther than Heck, saying the state should give the policy a try. He says his college fraternity at UMass-Amherst was split between beer drinkers and potheads, and in his opinion alcohol probably caused more damage. “I think it was the beer drinkers who caused more destruction and misbehavior, but they’re the ones who did better in school,” he says laughing.
Muri said the law could always be changed again if the initiative is a failure. Heck said he is more sympathetic to the idea of changing federal law to enable more use of medical marijuana with a prescription. It’s clear that voters in the new Tenth Congressional District have landed two candidates with different positions on nearly every issue. But unlike Heck, Muri faces the challenge of communicating his views on a financial shoestring.

K.The present invention relates to a method of delivering a fine powder to the upper portion of a person's lower respiratory tract to provide symptomatic treatment of ailments due to the common cold and respiratory discomfort due to allergies, and to provide general oral and respiratory hygiene. More particularly, the present invention relates to a method for delivering a predetermined dose quantity of dry powdered sodium chloride.
Treatment of respiratory diseases by inhalation of fine rock salt particles (halotherapy) in salt caves or salt mines has been practiced for centuries in places such as Eastern Europe. The efficacy is associated with the unique micro climate within the salt caves and mines. The main curative factor is an atmosphere saturated with dry sodium chloride aerosol with particles of 2 to 5 microns in size. The salt aerosol is formed by the convective diffusion of the fine salt particles from the salt walls. Halotherapy has been recognized as a highly effective drug-free treatment for patients with various forms of chronic nonspecific pulmonary diseases. In a typically treatment, a patient will reside in the salt caves for up to twelve hours per day, breathing in the fine salt powder. In areas where salt mines are not available, special rooms have been constructed in which the environmental conditions of the salt mines are artificially reproduced. The patient resides in the halotherapy rooms in like manner as for the salt caves or mines.
Recent studies have indicated that much shorter exposures to aerosolized dry powder salt can provides relief of symptoms of common colds, e.g., sore throat, cough, headache, etc. These studies were conducted with a bench top laboratory system having a means for aerosolizing a quantity of fine powdered salt located within an enclosed chamber. One wall of the chamber included an opening at which a patient's face was positioned so that the atmosphere of aerosolized dry powder salt was available for inhalation. The bench top system provided the respiratory benefit without requiring the patient to be physically located within the chamber. While the patient was not inconvenienced by having to remain in a cave for an extended period, the patient was effectively restricted by the laboratory system. A portable powder delivery system is therefore needed for commercial usefulness of halotherapy.
Aerosolized liquid saline sprays, that are delivered by rather complex medical hardware, are often used in intensive care facilities. These sprays are commonly used to increase mucociliary clearance. However, liquid saline sprays are not well suited in size and cost to provide relief of symptoms to the common cold sufferer because the salt in a liquid saline solution is highly diluted. Thus, liquid saline sprays do not deliver the much higher concentrations of salt to the airways of the lower respiratory tract possible with dry salt powder inhalation.
It has also been long recognized that gargling with a salt solution provides relief from some of the symptoms of colds, primarily sore throat. In fact some studies have indicated that the relief afforded by a salt gargle matches the performance of some over-the-counter sore throat sprays and lozenges. However beneficial salt water gargling may be, it is usually inconvenient to avail oneself of such a remedy.
There are available dry powder inhalers (DPI) which are intended to deliver drugs to the lower portion of the lower respiratory tract, primarily to the lungs, for relief of ailments of the lungs, such as asthma, or to provide systemic drug delivery through the very large surface and thin membranes of the lungs. Accordingly, the drug particle size and properties are optimized for delivery to the lower portion of the lower respiratory tract. For example, particle sizes in the range of 1 microns to 5 microns are useful for powder delivery to the lungs.
Halotherapy for treatment of cold symptoms is directed to the topical application of salt particles at the upper portion of the lower respiratory tract. A portable dry powder delivery system, matched to the desired distribution of the salt particles, is needed for a convenient means for providing drug free cold symptom relief. Furthermore, convenient topical application of salt powder to the upper portion of the lower respiratory tract can provide relief from everyday discomfort due to such problems as allergies, post nasal drip, etc. Moreover, other ingredients may be added to a salt powder, such as menthol or breath fresheners, that could provide an aid in routine throat clearing and freshening of breath.
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a method which can deliver dose quantities of dry fine powdered sodium chloride for topical treatment of the upper portion of the lower respiratory tract from a simple and inexpensive portable delivery device.
In one aspect of the present invention, a method of providing halotherapy to the upper portion of the lower respiratory tract comprises the steps of operating a dispenser and inhaling. The dispenser contains a dry sodium chloride powder. The user operates the dispenser to release a dosage of the powder for inhalation when the dispenser is aimed into the user's mouth. The user inhales the dosage of powder through the mouth. Because the powder has a particle size range enabling the powder to target the upper portion of the lower respiratory tract without entering the user's lungs, the dosage of the dry powder provides a concentration at the upper portion sufficient to provide effective halotherapy. The preferred particle size range is from about 5 microns to about 20 microns. The preferred dosage is about 3 milligrams of powder.
The dry sodium chloride powder preferably includes excipients, such as lactose, to prevent agglomeration of the powder. The dry sodium chloride powder may also include ingredients to enhance halotherapy, such as ascorbic acid, menthol, mint flavors, citrus flavors, breath fresheners, and a combination thereof.
The dispenser is preferably selected from a group consisting of single dose sprayers which propel powder when actuated, multiple dose sprayers which propel powder when actuated, single dose inhalers which enable powder to enter a user's breath during inhalation, and multiple dose inhalers which enable powder to enter a user's breath during inhalation.
While the specification concludes with claims which particularly point out and distinctly claim the present invention, it is believed that the present invention will be better understood from the following description of preferred embodiments, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawing in which:
FIG. 1 is side elevation schematic view of the method for delivering halotherapy of the present invention, showing a person holding a dry powder inhaler at their mouth and the flow of powder from the inhaler to the intended internal target area;
FIG. 2 is a top plan view of a prior art device intended for propelling a single dose of dry powder therefrom; and
FIG. 3 is a side elevation view thereof, showing a hemispherical air-filled bulb being deformed in order to propel powder from a downstream chamber outwardly through a discharge orifice.
Referring now to the drawings, and more particularly to FIG. 1, there is shown a preferred method of delivering halotherapy of the present invention, which is generally indicated as 10. A halotherapy patient or user 21 has a lower respiratory tract 20, which has an upper portion that includes a pharynx 22, an epiglotis 23, a larynx 24, a trachea 25, and a bronchial tube 26. Method 10 includes use of a dry powder inhaler 30 by user 21. Inhaler 30 is suitable for delivering a predetermined dose quantity of a dry powdered sodium chloride 40 having a particle size distribution in the range from about 5 microns to about 50 microns. Dry powdered sodium chloride 40 is delivered into a breath air stream as user 21 inhales through mouth 32 to topically administer dry powdered sodium chloride 40 to the surfaces of the upper portion of lower respiratory tract 20.
In a particularly preferred embodiment of the present invention, a suitable multiple use inhaler having a bulk reservoir of powdered sodium chloride for multiple dosing, a means for releasing a predetermined metered dose of powdered sodium chloride, and a means for enabling the predetermined metered dose of powdered sodium chloride to mix with a user's breath in response to inhalation by the user, may be used to administer halotherapy to the upper portion of the lower respiratory tract, in particular, the larynx, trachea, bronchi, and upper lung. Such a multiple use inhaler is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,263,475 issued to Altermatt et al. on Nov. 23, 1993. This inhaler meters a predetermined quantity of solids from a storage chamber into an air channel wherein the particles are mixed with an air stream generated by the inhaled breath of the user. The air stream transports the solids through the oral cavity and into the respiratory tract. In the particularly preferred embodiment for providing halotherapy of the present invention, a supply of fine powdered sodium chloride is provided in the bulk reservoir.
Excipients, such as lactose, may be added to sodium chloride particles to prevent agglomeration of the particles or as additional bulk to aid in precise metering of small quantities of the fine powdered sodium chloride. Other minor ingredients may be added such as ascorbic acid (vitamin C), menthol, breath fresheners or the like to enhance the pleasantness and efficacy of the salt therapy.
In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the user may use a suitable single use inhaler having a single predetermined dose of fine powdered sodium chloride and means for delivering the predetermined metered dose of powdered sodium chloride in response to the inhalation. Such a single use dispenser is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,533,505 issued to Kallstrand et al. on Jul. 9, 1996. This dispenser presents a predetermined quantity of powdered product in a compartment which is mixed in an air stream generated by the inhaled breath of the user. The air stream transports the powdered product through the oral cavity and into respiratory tract.
In yet another preferred embodiment of the present invention, a suitable single use dispenser has a single predetermined dose of powdered sodium chloride and means for propelling the predetermined dose of powdered sodium chloride into the inhaled breath of the user. Such a single use dispenser is disclosed in commonly owned U.S. Pat. No. 5,215,221 issued to Dirksing on Jun. 1, 1993, and is hereby incorporated herein by reference. FIGS. 2 and 3 show this prior art dispenser, generally indicated as 41. Dispenser 41 has a hemispherical air-filled bulb 42, a powder reservoir 44, and a discharge orifice 46. When orifice 46 is aimed into the user's mouth and bulb 42 is pressed between thumb and finger by the user, sodium chloride powder 40 is propelled through orifice 46 from reservoir 44 by the burst of air generated by deforming bulb 42. The user takes a breath through mouth 32 while rapidly pressing bulb 42, thereby mixing powder 40 with the inhaled air. Inhaled air is directed to the user's lower respiratory tract by the reduced air pressure generated by the lungs; however, powdered sodium chloride having a particle size range from about 5 microns to about 20 microns has sufficient volume and mass to be deposited from the inspired air onto the mucosal surfaces of the upper portion of the lower respiratory tract without being carried into the lungs. Particle sizes lower than 5 microns can typically be expected to be carried into the lungs, beyond the preferred topical treatment zone. Particle sizes above 50 microns can be expected to be so large that inhalation air velocity may be insufficient to transport them beyond the oral cavity.
In a particularly preferred embodiment, sodium chloride particle size ranges from 5 microns to 20 microns, and a predetermined dose is 3 milligrams of powder. Such a dose provides a light coating of fine powdered sodium chloride onto the mucosal surfaces of the upper portion of the lower respiratory tract to relive soreness and enhance expectoration. Actual dosage may vary by individual user but doses above 5 milligrams may induce coughing while doses below 1 milligram may not provide sufficient coating.
Excipients may be added to sodium chloride powder to improve dispensing properties. An example is lactose. Lactose is typically added for this purpose in the range of 2 to 5 percent. Other ingredients may be added to the mixture, such as potassium chloride, ascorbic acid, menthol, mint flavors, citrus flavors, breath fresheners, and a combination thereof These ingredients are added such that they typically have a proportion by weight less than about 10 percent and may be added to enhance expect modification that are within the scope of the invention.A."
Zucker continues: "This was a man who loves politics, loved his faith, loved his family, and loved his Buffalo Bills. His ability to make the most complex political issues of our day [understandable], and then in the same program tell you why he loved his father, made him a unique figure in American television history."
Tributes at Peabody AwardsMeanwhile, tributes to the TV newsman, who died Friday of a heart attack at age 58, poured from his journalism colleagues at Monday's 67th Annual Peabody Awards at New York's Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, which recognizes excellence in the electronic media for last year.
"He was the smartest, kindest person I've ever known," says ABC News anchor Bob Woodruff.
Woodruff, who was critically wounded in a roadside bomb in 2006 while reporting from Iraq, cited Russert's support for the family of NBC reporter David Bloom, who died of a pulmonary embolism while covering the 2003 Iraq invasion. "[Russert] did the same thing for my wife and my children after I was injured," says Woodruff. "I've never really thought something would happen this early. He was only ten years older than me."
CBS News correspondent Kimberly Dozier, who is recovering from serious injuries she suffered while reporting in Iraq in 2006, once studied Russert's interview methods. "So natural, so at ease, and so well informed," she says. "That's what we all aspire to be. He was just a regular guy who just was smarter than everybody else."

"Nice Format.".The Black Mamba is a large, streamlined snake with a narrow, coffin-shaped head and smooth scales. The back is uniform gunmetal to olive-brown, but never really black; the belly is pale grey-green, sometimes with dark blotches, and the mouth lining is black.
Black Mambas are found in the northern parts of the subcontinent (absent from desert), extending south along Kwa-Zulu Natal coast to port St. Johns and elsewhere, to Senegal and Somalia.
12 - 17 eggs are laid in termite nests, etc. These hatch in 80 - 90 days; growth is rapid, a Black Mamba may reach 2 000 mm in length in its first year.
The venom is neurotoxic and cardiotoxic, yielding 100 - 400 mg; 10 -15 mg is fatal in humans.
Black Mambas feed on fledgling birds and small mammals such as rats and dassies.Top-ranked DePauw sneaks by Centre in double-overtime thriller

Thank you for sharing!.Instead of the rigid Sergeant Howie and his ideological opposition to the lifestyle of those on Summerisle, The Wicker Tree gives us born-again Christian pop singer Beth Boothby (Brittania Nicol) and her dumb cowboy boyfriend Steve (Henry Garrett), embarking on a tour of Scotland with the goal of recruiting some new churchgoers. When the citizens of the big city slam their doors in the pair's faces, they head out into the countryside, where Sir Lachlan Morrison (Graham McTavish) and Lady Delia Morrison (Jacqueline Leonard) are sure they'll have better luck getting through to less jaded folks.
The brilliance of the original Wicker Man lies in the strength of the debate between Howie (Edward Woodward) and Lord Summerisle (Christopher Lee), and the pitch-perfect gnawing anxiety that builds up as Howie digs deeper and deeper into the mysteries of the island. The Wicker Tree offers no such back-and-forth, and a complete lack of creepiness. Beth and Steve are completely clueless, pleased by everything and everyone they come in contact with, driven by idiotic motivation to accept that everything is as it seems, and generally uninterested or unaware of anything unusual about their new surroundings. It's weird, too, because some of the more prominent characters are pretty ridiculous, from the stuttering man who speaks only in rhymes and carries a raven (David Plimmer) to the beautiful horse trainer (Honeysuckle Weeks) with an insatiable sexual appetite. McTavish's Morrison is meant to be a surrogate for Lee's Summerisle, but he and Beth hardly interact after the first half-hour, and McTavish's motivation is far less compelling than that of Summerisle.
Hardy's focus, behind the camera and as a screenwriter, is deeply lacking. Much of the movie is inexplicably taken up by Lolly, the horse trainer, who desires a baby and eventually seduces Steve in the hope of getting pregnant. Hardy plays her attraction to Steve as authentic, and she tries to help him as the movie goes on, but Lolly is also seen at random times having wild sex with a local cop named Orlando (Alessandro Conetta), without appearing to have any feelings for Steve. Later, Hardy gives Orlando an awkward exit that fails to define Lolly's motivation and nearly fails to simply convey the event to the audience (a sequence of shots is shown without much emphasis on what they mean). Hardy also gets hung up on several terrible sequences of awkward comedy, both intentional (crotch-hit humor, really) and unintentional (a ridiculously fake dead cat prop, the worst music video of all time).
Much of The Wicker Man's effectiveness can also be attributed to the casting: Edward Woodward and Christopher Lee were equally matched, and delivered powerful performances. Nicol, comparatively, isn't within a hundred miles of Woodward, giving a flat performance with wooden line readings and little more than a "bad smell" sourface when given terrifying news. McTavish is better but fails to really make an impression. Again, the roles are inherently lacking, McTavish with weaker drive and the simple, boring arc of Boothby as a reformed sinner, but neither actor comes close to bringing out anything in the writing. Weeks probably fares the best, exuding a little sexiness through copious nudity and an upbeat attitude, but the film counters that with a truly embarrassing cameo appearance by Lee himself, who appears to be falling asleep, reciting the simplest, flattest dialogue in front of the world's worst greenscreen effect.
Where The Wicker Man placed two men with specific ideals against one another and watched the sparks fly, The Wicker Tree offers a blank canvas. There's no conflict here, no friction, no hook. There is no reason Beth Boothby couldn't have been subbed out for a hundred other random characters with any number of dreams and goals, and the result is a film so lacking in dramatic tension it nearly fails to be a story. Most sequels are a mess, particularly those with long gaps between entries, but this is truly an embarrassment, and a total waste of time.
The Blu-Ray
The Wicker Tree has nicely-designed artwork that evokes one of the original Wicker Man posters from back in the day, without appearing to modern or cluttered, and with a pleasing absence of goofy Photoshop (like throwing the lead actors' faces into the image). I do question one of the pull quotes on the back, though: "You'll see faces, performances, and scenes you'll never see in any other movie."
The Video and Audio
The Wicker Tree's AVC-encoded 2.35:1 1080p presentation starts promising but quickly goes downhill. Although the film was shot on the RED One, daytime exterior sequences are a tiny bit soft and grainy, which actually creates a nice filmic look. When the film goes indoors, however, the grain turns into garish digital noise, and colors really take a turn for the worse, almost always appearing washed out, and at other times, digitally tweaked or over-saturated. Blacks are frequently an ugly green color, and in one early hotel room scene, the purple on a dress even bleeds, with some weird yellows flaring out around it. Some posterization is also visible during the title sequence, and at at least one point I spotted some faint artifacting.
A Dolby Digital TrueHD 5.1 track is strong. Modern small films tend to have too little going on in terms of sound design, but The Wicker Tree is a well-mixed movie. Filled churches, people singing songs in pubs, horses in fields, even the inside of a crow's mind are packed with nice little surround touches. Top it off with a decent score -- a rarity in low-budget movies -- and you have a nice, well-rounded aural presentation.
The Extras
Two basic extras are included. "The Making of The Wicker Tree" (12:15), and a reel of deleted scenes (11:41). One can tell they're in trouble from the beginning of the featurette when Robin Hardy's first comments are about "the genre we invented with The Wicker Man" and how "nobody else has ever really tried it." Deleted scenes primarily consist of more dancing and singing, but there is an alternate ending-ish thing in there.
Trailers for Battle Royale and The Divide play before the main menu. An original theatrical trailer for The Wicker Tree is also included.
Conclusion
Yes, it's true: even the Nicolas Cage remake was better than this. At least you could laugh at the absurdity of it and some of the themes from the original film were visible underneath Cage's acting. Skip it.August 7 2013

The dream of supposedly affordable health care is turning into a nightmare.
Earlier this week we reported that the administration is launching a heavy PR blitz to educate Americans on Obamacare in advance of major rollout deadlines this fall.
Now, we’re learning that testing data security –a critical piece of the legislation– is behind schedule potentially, placing the personal information of millions of Americans at risk.
The health exchanges, state-run public insurance markets, are set to open on October 1. But because of missed deadlines, testing on the data hub, a system that manages access to the records of participants in the programs, will not be tested until the end of September. This means the system may go online with security flaws and be open to security breaches – a hackers dream!
With so much at stake, you might expect the Administration to delay the health exchange opening so that testing can occur, but that won’t happen, according to Deven McGraw, a technology expert tracking this issue:
"They've removed their margin for error. There is huge pressure to get (the exchanges) up and running on time, but if there is a security incident they are done. It would be a complete disaster from a PR viewpoint."
Just how far behind schedule are they on testing? According to an inspector general’s report released on Friday, Health and Human Services had set an early June deadline to test security elements and that has now been pushed to this week and next –two months behind schedule. The rippling impact of the testing means the system won’t be certified as secure until as late as a day before the big enrollment day for Obamacare.
Good luck to those who can’t wait to be first in line for free national healthcare. They may go home with more than just new benefits.
The information hub doesn’t store information itself, but acts as a portal connecting to the IRS and other agencies that allow verification of people’s information. So come October 1, if it is not verified as secure it should not be able to come online. That doesn’t mean enrollment will be halted or postponed but those who do apply for insurance will not be told if they have been accepted or whether they are eligible for government subsidies to pay their premiums.
Somehow, I’m not convinced that the hub will be delayed if it’s not verified. Under pressure to save face the president likely will want to meet the rollout deadline, especially since other major healthcare deadlines have been postponed. It’s unfortunate that the government doesn’t consider security as a high enough priority that it would delay enrollment. This demonstrates what happens when political agendas trump security and reveals yet another problem with implementing massive sweeping legislation: unintended consequences.
This is not the only time we’ve highlighted security issues around the collection of people’s personal information. Recently we raised other security issues after uncovering the lax standards state exchanges were using to recruit insurance agents –I mean enrollment counselors– to get people enrolled in Obamacare.
In California, enrollment counselors are being farmed from thousands of community organizations with little regard to their criminal background. Yes, let’s give a former thief access to the names, social security numbers, addresses, financial information and medical histories of applicants. Couple that with this new revelation that the electronic system housing all of this information may not even be secure, we’ve got serious grounds for concern.
Morally and constitutionally, Obamacare is wrong for America as it expands the role of government beyond what the majority of Americans want, but now it reveals its sinister practical implementations.This study is provided by ICPSR.

But first I want to mention our 32” Panasonic TV with in-build FreeView and FreeSat tuners. It’s in perfect working order and needs a good home. It seems such a shame to dump it in a skip. Does anyone want it? Only condition is that you must collect it!
It was the boat trading weekend in Birmingham and all the usual moorings were full, however we managed to find what turned out to be a good mooring away from the usual areas. Jan noticed nb Wandering Bark and we did manage to stop for a brief chat with Helen and bought some jars of her lovely chutney and jam.
The tomato and ginger chutney is delicious!
I had purchased in advance cheap tickets (Birmingham-London) and boarded the Virgin train only to find the carriage full and someone in my reserved seat. On requesting he vacate my seat I was informed Virgin had cancelled all reserved seating which made me more than a little annoyed. Eventually I found another seat, but have yet to forgive Virgin…… (it may take some time!)
After topping up the Oyster card I made my way to Heathrow Terminal 3 on the Tube. Our niece from Perth was arriving on Emirates via Dubai and I wanted to find a position where I could observe her entry into the Arrivals Hall before greeting her. I’d previously informed her the best way to avoid any touts was to confidently stride through the crowd giving the appearance she knew where she was going (it’s her first time to the UK). She did very well. In fact so well that she confidently walked right passed me without even noticing me standing beside a column.
However her immigration and customs clearances had taken longer than I had allowed so it was a frantic dash back to Euston Street Station for the train to Birmingham. The pressure was really on when; with only 5 minutes before departure time; the Virgin ticket machine refused to accept her booking code. Eventually I tried a second machine and off we dashed for the train.
With only one full day together we planned a short cruise down to Kings Norton Junction.
This was piece of canal we hadn’t previously done. At Kings Norton Junction the Worchester & Birmingham Canal meets the Stratford-Upon Avon Canal. On our last hire boat holiday in 2009 we had come up the Stratford-Upon Avon Canal and turned left, away from Birmingham. We can now say we’ve cruised all of the Worcester and Birmingham Canal.
The main reason for deciding to head south was to reach this place.
Because the way to a girls heart is….
Where some serious shopping took place.
We had a lovely dinner together. One jet-lagged niece managed to stay awake until 9.00pm before crashing into a very heavy sleep. As expected she was awake at 4.00am, but managed to nod off for another couple of hours. Hopefully she is now over most of the jet-lag. We took her to New Street Station for her trip back to London where she is meeting her girlfriends to commence her bus trip around Europe.Title: What Dogs and Cats Really Want: Decreasing Stress and Meeting Behavioral Needs
When: Ongoing
Where: Online
Stress is a word that is used in all kinds of contexts from dogs that are ‘stressed’ when they can’t get a cookie they want, to dogs that are ‘stressed’ from being in a new training class, to cats that are ‘stressed’ from fighting with other cats in the household. But what is stress, and can we reduce the stress in our pets’ lives? Is a certain amount of stress good for our animals? The first step in helping stressed animals is recognizing differences in both the stressors and manifestations of stress for different species, breeds and individuals. Defining stressors, stress behavior, examples of how to reduce the stress in the lives of animals, prioritizing and meeting behavioral needs, and recent research regarding owners’ recognition of stress in their animals are just some of the topics we’ll cover in this webinar. General information about stress and the specifics of stress in dogs will be our focus in the first session, followed by stress in cats and your questions and answers in the second. Don’t miss this webinar. You’ll come away with a new appreciation of stress and some new ways of addressing it.

WebTimber counties pine for federal money
SALEM, Ore. (AP) — Leaders from counties that depend on federal timber payments to pay for roads and police say they're hopeful that proposed federal legislation might help restore critical funding that recently expired.
County officials were in Salem on Monday to explain their dire financial situation to Gov. John Kitzhaber.
The counties are concerned about their financial viability after the expiration of federal spending intended to make up for dwindling logging revenue from national forests.
Over the weekend, three Oregon congressmen published a column in the Oregonian outlining a proposal to increase logging on some federal forest land while designating other areas for conservation.
Democrats Kurt Schrader and Peter Defazio, and Republican Greg Walden, said they hope the plan would provide long-term stability for the counties.

We must really love "Les Miserables" around here. South Bay Musical Theatre opened a four week run of the beloved musical last Saturday -- and the entire run of 12 performances had been sold out for three weeks. That's a first for the 50-year-old theater company, which was formerly known as the Saratoga Drama Group and operates out of the 300-seat Saratoga Civic Theater.
Nearly 300 people auditioned for the 38 roles in the show, set in 1800s France. South Bay Musical Theatre called on Karie Bennett and her artistic staff at Atelier salon at Santana Row to give the cast historically accurate hair. And Atelier's Elizabeth Bozzo gave the cast a tutorial on how to use makeup to get the right look for each character, be they soot-covered beggars, vulgarly dolled-up prostitutes or students fighting at the barricades.
And Bennett had one amazing task herself: On Sept. 19, she gave Corrie Borris, who plays Fantine, a short-cropped haircut for her pivotal scene. Quite a sacrifice for Borris, whose wedding is about 11 months away.
By the way, if you weren't lucky enough to snag one of the seats for Les Miz, you can still celebrate at the company's 50th anniversary gala, which is taking place Nov. 2 at Mariani's Restaurant in Santa Clara. Get all the details at.
BANDS ON THE RUN: My wife, Amy, has been dutifully training for weeks to join some 16,000 runners for this Sunday's eighth annual Rock 'N' Roll Half-Marathon in downtown San Jose. Now, the appeal of running 13.1 miles is entirely lost on me, but that's what makes a marriage interesting. Besides, I still love this event because of the bands that play for the participants and spectators every mile or so.
The Independence High School Marching Band will kick things off at the start line and then again at San Jose City Hall. Other bands along the way include SixString, the Honey Wilders, Come back Buddy and the Hoover Middle School Band.
After all the awards are handed out at 11 a.m. during the Finish Line Festival at Plaza de Cesar Chavez, Atlas Genius -- an alt rock band from Australia -- will take the stage for a celebratory concert. And that concert is free and open to everyone, runner or not.
MORE MUSIC FOR A CAUSE: There's really no shortage of benefit concerts on Sunday evening. Earlier this week, I mentioned Girls Got the Blues are performing at Theatre on San Pedro Square to support Next Door Solutions for Domestic Violence. Also on Sunday, the Kavanaugh Brothers will be playing Irish tunes at Rosie McCann's in Santana Row to benefit the Lymphoma and Leukemia Society. The 4 p.m. show will include a silent auction and raffle, and Rosie McCann's is donating 20 percent of food and drink proceeds to the nonprofit.
Finally, there's a concert at Poor House Bistro in downtown San Jose to help out Ron Thompson, the bluesman whose guitars were stolen along with his car a few weeks ago. Thompson did get the car back -- though it cost nearly $1,500 to get the stripped car back in running shape -- and recovered three guitars with the help of another Bay Area musician who put up reward money. The all-star line up, which will include Thompson, plays from 3 to 7 p.m.

The Chinese State Internet Information Office says the new vetting procedures aim to prevent hardware suppliers from "taking advantage of their products to illegally control, disrupt or shutdown their clients' systems," or to gather sensitive information.
"For a long time, governments and enterprises of a few countries have gathered sensitive information on a large scale, taking the advantage of their monopoly in the market and technological edge," said Jiang Jun, a government spokesman speaking to the state-controlled Xinhua News Agency. "They not only seriously undermine interests of their clients but also threaten cyber security of other countries."
The announcement comes little more than a week after new revelations about NSA spying, in which the agency stands accused of directly tampering with American-made networking devices. According confidential documents leaked by Edward Snowden and reported on in journalist Glenn Greenwald's new book, the NSA will occasionally intercept networking hardware bound for overseas destinations, implant them with backdoor security access devices, reseal them, and then forwarding the compromised devices on to their final destinations.
Though this specific allegation was not addressed, Jun said that Snowden's leaks "rang alarm bells" and reminded people about the importance of cybersecurity.
"It shows that without cyber security, there's no national security," he said.
This new policy is a bit of an ironic twist. For years, the U.S. government has been warning that Chinese companies have been building network devices with vulnerable backdoor access. And Greenwald concludes that both countries are likely engaged in the same kind of espionage activities, even as they chide one another for doing so.
“It is quite possible that Chinese firms are implanting surveillance mechanisms in their network devices,” Greenwald writes. “But the U.S. is certainly doing the same.”

It's been taking him an hour and 10-20 minutes to go each way, and he's been exhausted all the time. After I bought my Ezip, he started to get interested. I kept giving him stats on rides and info about the bike. A few weeks later, he bought one. He got it this week, and it has cut his commute time by 30-40 minutes each way. He's still pedaling, breathing hard, and sweating, but not for so long. He seems pretty happy with this solution right now.
Meanwhile, I've noticed a lot more motorized bicycles on the road in the past year. There is also a shop that popped up to deal scooters and electric bicycles ("real" electric bicycles and not scooters disguised as bicycles).
I love to see all these changes. More and more people are getting a clue.What is the spacecraft?
The spacecraft is separate from the launch vehicle. It is the protective "spaceship" that enables the precise cargo (that is, the rover!) to travel between Earth and Mars once the launch vehicle has already projected it outside of Earth´s atmosphere and gravity pull.
The spacecraft includes the mechanical units that safely carry and maneuver the rover as it enters the Martian atmosphere and lands on Mars. Once on the surface, like a semi-truck carrying a racecar cross-country, it lowers a ramp to let the rover drive out.
The spacecraft consists of:
The spacecraft design for the Mars Exploration Rover mission is largely based on the successful Mars Pathfinder system for entry, descent, and landing. The rover design is based on the Athena Rover on the previously cancelled Mars 2001 lander mission.
How much does the spacecraft weigh?
Each system has a total launch mass of 1,063 kilograms (2,343 pounds). The mass of each primary part of the spacecraft is as follows:2010 Finished first at the Wolfpack Invitational in 15:11.4 Placed 34th at the Roy Griak Invitational, running the 8k course in 25:10.5 Came in 35th at the NCAA Pre-Nationals, running the 8k course in a time of 24:22.8 Was NC State's third runner at the ACC Championships, finishing 19th in a time of 24:18.0 Placed 75th at the NCAA Southeast Regional in Louisville, Ky., running the 10k course in 32:36.7Finished 192nd at the NCAA Championship, running the 10k course in a time of 32:03.4

Mechanism for enabling layer two host addresses to be shielded from the switches in a network
Image Number 9 for
United States Patent #8125996
.
Methods and systems for shielding layer two host addresses (e.g., MAC addresses) from a network are provided. According to one embodiment, a border component of a network of switches receives a first packet intended for a first host having a first L2 address and a first L3 address associated therewith. The first packet includes the first L3 address and a substitute L2 address as destination addresses. The substitute L2 address is associated with a communication channel of the border component. A data structure including information regarding an association between the first L3 address and the first L2 address is accessed by the border component. A determination is made that the destination L2 address for the first packet should be the first L2 address. A first updated packet is derived from the first packet by replacing the substitute L2 address with the first L2 address and sent to the first host.
