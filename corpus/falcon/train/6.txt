Dads are often reluctant to make the most of time off for fear of repercussions
More than half of Australian employees are close to breaking point as they struggle to cope with increased levels of information in their daily working lives.
According to new research by workflow solutions provider LexisNexis, information levels are at an all-time high, with Australia leading the rest of the world in the amount of data each professional is required to manage.
Marc Peter, director of technology and business development at LexisNexis, said the information boom, along with pressure from markets, shareholders and customers to hit targets, is leading to 'information rage' and having a negative effect on productivity.
“The implementation of information and communication technology (ICT) is changing the way we work, and the speed of this technology is dictating our expectations on responses and results. As humans we struggle to keep up [with technology]; the good thing with this research is that now we have evidence of that.”
Peter added that the research showed employees are spending more time on receiving and managing information than actually using it to generate outputs, leading to a direct loss on the balance sheet.
“It is employers’ responsibility to provide workflow tools as the extra pressure has a negative impact on staff morale and also the quality of work being done,” he said.
“In the professional services industry, if you bring graduates on board and they experience an unproductive environment in terms of how information is managed and the workflow tools which help them manage their processes, you might well lose them.”
The survey of 1,700 white collar workers from Australia, the US, China, South Africa, and UK found that ‘information rage’ is in large part due to three drivers: workers reporting feelings of frustration and dejection from the huge volume of information, the irrelevance of the majority of that information, and the inability of the systems and processes to manage information.
“It is worse in Australia because we don’t have the same level of effectiveness and sophistication in how we use technology as the UK and US in order to deal with high levels of information,” said Peter.Music performance is a big part of New City Kids.

At this time of the year, folks start talking about how things are looking, whether it be the possible line combinations of their own favorite team or how teams around the league compare on paper, especially in light of the players they’ve signed and those they have lost. I’d like to take this opportunity to mention a few things about our team's line combinations in the upcoming season.
LINE COMBINATIONS
I’m not all that interested about who exactly is going to be playing with whom this upcoming season. We all know that injuries and Gordon’s previous affinity for trying different players on different lines will make any conversation at this point redundant. Sure, the Comeau-Bailey-Okposo line had its moments while Nielsen and Hunter had seemed to form some nice chemistry before injuries removed them from one another. Thompson and Jackman do make for a rough & tumble fourth line pair and Jackman truly became a player you just have to admire, even if it hurt seeing that guy’s nose being broken time and time again. With John Tavares now becoming our great hope in the goal-scoring department, it would only seem logical that he spend some time playing with Doug Weight, who still remains the best pure passer on this team. With Roloson and Biron being extremely capable of providing decent goaltending, the ever injury-prone defense remains intact, with Mark Streit a shining star among a bunch of guys best considered numbers 5 and 6 DMen, at least on any team hoping to fight for a playoff spot.
A bigger question to me is who is really gonna make the team and in what capacity? When thinking about any and all youngins in the system, Tavares included, I have to think about something Darryl Sutter recently said about the situation in Calgary, and I quote, "I really don't care how many one-way contracts we have … I think there's six kids in (July's top prospects camp) who are going to knock the (stuffing) out of some guys for jobs," Sutter said. "And I love it. That's the way it works."
Yep, that’s the way it works – for most NHL teams. For our beloved Islanders, many of those one-way contracts ARE the kids going into our camp. They may not be the youngest, but these contracts have gone to players like Nielsen and Tambellini last summer, and now Comeau and Hillen this summer. Sure, there are some such contracts that this team appears to just have to eat, most notably that of one Mr. Jon Sim. Few of us are planning with him, but he’s there and may hang around a while. He may also get sent to Bridgeport, but chances are that he’ll be one of the 14 forwards remaining on the Island and ready to fill in when necessary. In light of the players we can all expect to be on the Island come the home opener against the Stanley Cup champion Pittsburgh Penguins, here are the players that seem the most interesting to me going into camp, in no particular order.
JOHN TAVARES
We are all assuming he’ll be on the Island this season. There are many various statistical predictions being made by fans about what he’ll do this year, but fact of the matter is, we should be ecstatic if his season can somewhat mirror that of what Steven Stamkos accomplished in an unsettled TB environment last season. Fortunately, although we do not boast a line-up with names like Lecavalier, St. Louis, Malone and Prospal up front, we do have a wee bit more stability in management than what Stamkos experienced since becoming a member of the Lightning. What I can say about Tavares is that chances are very slim that he’ll be in this line-up as a center this season. Not only do the likes of Weight, Bailey, Nielsen and Thompson seem to have the middle wrapped up (with Park always a ready option as well), but Tavares will have enough responsibility under the incredible spotlight he'll no doubt find himself subjected to. A few years back, Pittsburgh initially brought in Crosby on the wing and we can expect that the Isles will likely do the same. From what I gather, many see him being more of left wing in this line-up, but if anyone has seen his plethora of highlights dotting the Internet, this kid’s moves and shot are MADE for being conducted coming in from the right side. As such, the right wing is where I expect to see him this season.
TREVOR SMITH
After an exciting period of growth in his first pro season, Smith became Bridgeport’s absolute goalgetter last season. He’s gone from 20-17-37 to 30-32-62 within 12 months after having turned pro upon completion of his sophomore year of NCAA hockey. Simply put, the kid has some skills and a nose for the net. Unfortunately for us fans, he’s not the biggest player, nor is he the fastest. As I see it, he may be a handy depth player to have in the system, but if he ever becomes a regular NHLer, it’ll be a true testament to his will to achieve, because many things are working against him. Another cup of coffee on the Island should however take place this year. Expect a good long look at camp this fall.
JOEL RECHLICZ
Skills ready for the NHL, or rather the ECHL? There’s not much to say here – until proven otherwise, expect Joel to be with the Islanders and hanging around for the games where Gordon feels his fists are required. He has little competition in his role and – to his credit – did hold up pretty well in a few bouts to end last season, especially in the fight against Kostopolous. At this point, only Jackman brings this same element to the team, although many believe a few tough guys will find a camp invitation in their mailboxes in the coming weeks.
JESSE JOENSUU
Something that’s really got me thinking is the number of folks on various online fan sites and outlets who have practically GIVEN prospect Jesse Joensuu a spot in the '09-10 line-up in their mind’s eye. Anyone who believes that a 21 year old kid who just went 20-19-39 in 71 AHL games in his first year in North America – along with a decent 3 point performance in 7 meaningless games (at least in light of the non-existing playoff race) at the NHL level – has a “job to lose” on the Island, simply doesn’t understand how players are bread and how you build a winner. Sure, there are times when a guy dominates the AHL pointwise for several years in a row and a team decides that that player, usually aged somewhere between 23-26, simply must be given a spot in the line-up to sink or swim. Case in point: Jeff Tambellini. This however is not the case for young Jesse. Fortunately, I rest assured that the Islanders themselves aren’t gonna be giving him anything that he won’t be earning. I can almost guarantee you this though: unless he’s about the best player in camp, he’s starting on the farm. It surely wouldn’t be the worst thing for his still progressing development, especially considering the responsibilities he’d receive done there in all situations. Only Jesse can push the Isles to keep him here, but his game simply isn't there yet and there's no sense in him getting 5-7 minutes a night here when he can get more than double that on the farm.
JEFF TAMBELLINI
A solid 20-25 game finish at the end of last season is about the only logical reason why Jeff is still in the picture. He saved himself not so much by realizing his AHL scoring potential at the NHL level, but rather by becoming a pesty player who improved his corner work in leaps and bounds. Now, can he take the next step? Can his development progress in the same mold as that of Jason Blake, a player of similar size and speed, who also took his pretty little time turning into the NHLer he’s become? Jeff seems here to stay for now, but this year will surely be decisive in his establishment as a permanent NHLer – or not.
JACK HILLEN
The guy can move a puck every now and again and does have a decent first step. Still, if anyone thinks he’s currently as good or better than say, Freddy Meyer IV, doesn’t have much to base that claim on, for Freddy has proven much more physical and offensive acumen at this level in his short tenure here than Hillen has. Every team needs depth in this department, but this team is lacking in overall blueline and crease toughness and certainly isn’t getting better in that department with Hillen in the line-up. He lacks the weight, strength and experience. He’s got a one-way contract, but he also has competition from MacDonald, Kohn and newcomer Mark Flood. Don’t pencil him in yet - he's currently at best, DMan number 7.
MATT MOULSON
Never heard of him, ehh? Well, the former Cornell star is a 2003 9th rounder who now weighs in at 6’1” and 210 lbs. He’s put up some mighty fine numbers in 3 AHL seasons and in ’07-08, he played 22 games for Los Angeles and put up 5-4-9 numbers after 56 points in 57 AHL games. He was considered a player on the rise and a possible top 6 forward at the NHL level. Things didn’t quite go his way last season although his AHL numbers weren’t far off. Word is though that he’s put in a hell of a lot of work this summer and in light of being 26 years old, truly sees this as his last big shot at the NHL. Surely most fans that saw this signing initially thought that he'll simply add some necessary scoring depth for a Bridgeport squad that has lost three of its top four scorers. That may end up being the case, but don’t tell that to Matt. I for one am very much looking forward to seeing if he can head up to Saskatoon as a man on a mission.

Or as we say in China, Xingxiwoooooooooooooooooooo!
And this Friday is special because it is the Friday before the Chinese New Year holiday begins. Which means as of 3:20 this afternoon, I am on holiday. Which means tomorrow I am getting out of here and heading to Thailand. Which means I should probably pack.
Basically, life is looking up.
In keeping with my holiday-inspired, light and cheerful attitude, I am writing a light and cheerful post. It is mostly just a list of things I’m lovin’ on these days. But they all make me happy…so I thought maybe they might make you happy too.
Here we go…
1. Big Magic
Okay…there is so much to say about this book and yet I can’t possibly put it all into words. Suffice it to say that for me, right now, this book is everything. It is quickly becoming my bible. If you are in any way craving a bit more creativity in your life or just need a good pep talk from a woman who is smart, talented and not afraid to curse…drop what you are doing right now (But not the baby! Hold onto the baby!) and order it. It is good y’all. Real good.
I’ll make it easy for you. Here is the amazon link.
Love it! This song is on loop in my house right now. It just makes me so happy (and makes me want to go back to India). Full stop.
3. A Color Story
There are so many different apps out there that will help make your photos a little more fun. Right now, I am loving this one by A Beautiful Mess. I have had such a good time snapping photos of my kiddos and playing around with the filters on this. And…it is free! You can buy extra filters/add-ons but I haven’t yet and I am still having lots of fun with it! It is just a super simple way to make already cute photos that much cuter.
See Exhibit A:
And…Exhibit B:
I could keep going but you get the idea….it just gives it a little extra something, doesn’t it?
4. The Bold Life Movement
In my very first year of teaching, I met Kim. She was a student of mine. I remember her being adorable and bubbly and just genuinely a nice person. Somewhere down the line we became friends on Facebook, which allowed me a little peep-hole into her life. It so interesting to watch former students grow up and become adults! Truly fascinating. Especially when these students go out into the world and accomplish amazing things. I have watched from the sidelines as Kim worked hard this past year to launch her new brand, The Bold Life Movement.
I love her message. I love her attitude and approach to life. And I think she is going places! Check out her new podcast here. It may just inspire you to live a little more boldly! Proud of you Kim!
5. Autocorrect Greatness
I have seen these texts being shared on Facebook a lot recently, but just in case you missed it hit up my Homebody and Soul Facebook page (just click the Facebook tab at the top of this page)…you will find it there. It is seriously too good to miss!
Sometime in the future, when I am having a horrible day, I will revisit this. And everything will be right again.
But just to give this last point some context: The other night I found myself wide awake at 3:00 a.m. (Probably because a naked 5 year old was kicking me in the face and stealing the covers…but never mind that. For the record, that naked 5 year old is my son…I thought I should make that clear so it sounds less creepy). Anyway, I did what I normally do when faced with wide-awakeness in the middle of the night…I began mindlessly scrolling through Facebook. In my scrolling, I stumbled across the above mentioned collection of autocorrect fails and started reading. Y’all…I am not sure I have ever laughed so hard in my life. By text 15, I was practically choking. I was laughing SO hard but trying to be SO quiet so I wouldn’t wake anyone else up. In fact, Brado did wake up because he thought I was DYING. And then when I finally caught my breath to explain why I was laughing so hard, I gave him my phone to show him the texts. And then he was CRYING because he was laughing so hard. So it was 3 a.m. on a school night and here we were, with a naked 5 year old sleeping soundly between us, laughing so hard that tears were streaming down our faces. It was the BEST way to wake up (and then promptly go back to sleep).
So there you have it, 5 things that might lift your spirits on this Friday afternoon. And just because I love you….here is one more:

Spytector Install
Spytector can be successfully installed on any PC running Windows 2k/XP/Vista/Windows 7/Windows 8/Windows 10 (32-bit and 64-bit).
Spytector consists of 2 parts: the main program (used to create the "server") and the "server" file (the actual keystroke logger).
The first time the main Spytector program is run, the user will need agree to the
End-User License Agreement
(EULA).
Spytector is a portable application (also called standalone application) and this offer some advantages over the traditional setup programs (it can be stored on any internal or external data storage device, it leaves a smaller footprint on your system etc.). Spytector main application will run from wherever you place it, by example from a USB drive (and you can carry it around from computer to computer). Unlike the regular applications, the portable Spytector won't affect the OS-protected files/folders - it doesn't require administrative privileges for running and management.
Spytector won't create any shortcuts on Desktop, Start Menu, Quick Launch and there will be no entry in the Add/Remove Programs list.
<< back to top
Server Install
Spytector "server" (keylogger) can be successfully installed on any PC running Windows 2k/XP/2003/Vista/Windows 7, Windows 8 and Windows 10 (32-bit and 64-bit).
The "server" configuration is established from the main application. The settings include "server" name, logfile name, logfile size, log delivery options, keylogger filter, access restrictions and much more. After all the required settings are set the "server" must be created using the Build Server button. All the settings are encrypted and appended to the "server" file. The "server" is a standalone application, it doesn't depend in any way on the installed Spytector, so the same server can be run on all your computers. When the server is doubleclicked it'll automatically copy itself in the system. In the trial version a message box is displayed asking the user to agree with the keylogger installation.
<< back to top
Spytector Uninstall
Being a portable application, Spytector can be simply deleted. There aren't entries in the Add/Remove Programs list in Control Panel or in the Start Menu. Also, there isn't any shortcut on Desktop.
<< back to top
Server Uninstall
In the trial version, the "server" is automatically uninstalled after you've received 3 logs (either by Email/FTP or locally from the main Spytector program).
Also, when the "server" is built you have the option to set a hotkey for the uninstallation (the default hotkey is CTRL+SHIFT+F1). If that option is enabled, whenever you press the specified hotkey the "server" will silently remove itself.
<< back to top
Purpose
Spytector is an advanced monitoring program (spy software, keystroke logger) which is tracking all the activities of PC users (visited websites, all the keystrokes, opened windows, applications etc.) and delivers the logs to you via Email or/and FTP. More than that, in the delivered logs could be also included the locally stored passwords for newest versions of FireFox, Opera, Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Safari, GoogleTalk, Outlook, Windows Live Messenger etc. and URL history (visited websites). Spytector keylogger also intercepts both sides of chat (messenger conversations) for the most used chat applications (AIM, ICQ, Yahoo Messenger, MSN Messenger).
In the case you need to monitor only specific window applications or visited websites, it's possible to create a keylogger filter so only the desired info will be written in the logfile.
Spytector "server" allows you not to only monitor applications ran and websites visited but to restrict the access to them. It's possible to create filters and the specified applications and websites will be completely blocked.
Spytector "server" is completely invisible on the user desktop and cannot be seen in the task manager.
By using advanced hooking and stealth techniques, Spytector key logger can be used in the same time with most firewalls and antiviruses installed on your computer.
<< back to top
Security
The logfile is strongly encrypted locally and can be received either encrypted or decrypted in your email and FTP accounts.
Spytector can be password protected. If the password is set, you won't be able to run it without using the password.
<< back to top
Hotkeys
The "server" can be uninstalled by using the hotkey which was set during the building process - the default hotkey is CTRL+SHIFT+F1. After using the hotkey, the keylogger will uninstall silently (sometimes a reboot may be required for complete uninstallation).
Make sure you set a hotkey when you build your keylogger, that's quite useful in the case you need to uninstall it.
<< back to top
Local Options
On the Local Options you are able to password protect Spytector, in this case nobody will have access to it without knowing the password.
The interface (GUI) supports few languages (English, French, Portuguese) and skins that can be changed on the fly.
All the settings you use to configure Spytector can be saved, so the next time you run it you don't have to fill again all the necessary information.
By clicking Load Default Settings, all the current settings will be replaced with the initial (default) settings.
<< back to top
Basic Settings
On the Basic Settings panel you are able to set the name for the "server", copy the version information from another program and also change the "server" icon.
The file version information can be copied from any executable and helps the keylogger to be more undetected. On the other hand, it could be exactly the opposite (the keylogger could become detected) if you copy the version information from Microsoft programs. Also, in the case you copy the version info from programs that escalate Administrator privileges (by example setup programs), when running the "server" you will see a prompt from UAC asking "Do you want to allow the following program to make changes to this computer?".
The icon of the "server" can be changed either with one of the built-in icons or with an external icon of your choice. The icons included in Spytector are small (16x16 and 32x32 pixels and 256 color depth), so it could be a good thing to use a bigger icon. There are few antiviruses that detect the programs with small icons, so a bigger icon (let's say more than 50kb) could help on this matter.
<< back to top
If you want to receive the logs by email, you have to configure "Email Settings". You have to write an address of yours on the "Send Email From" field, and (if it's required) the password for authentication (the email login password), and another address of yours on the "Send Email To" field. Of course, you will receive the logs at the address written on "Send Email To". The "SMTP Address" and "SMTP Port" are mandatory and should be supplied by your email provider.
After you have filled in the required info, it's good to use the Test button to see if the settings are OK.
Spytector email feature works perfectly with port 465 (it uses a SSL connection). The most important thing is the email address on "Send Email From" and the SMTP. If those are working fine you can receive the logs to almost any email address (Gmail, Yahoo etc.). The email feature works fine with many email providers but for best results you should use a paid-for email account - the paid-for accounts are more reliable than the free ones. You can purchase email accounts from us or from somewhere else. Our email accounts are
$7.95 per month
and
$70 per year
.
The logs sent to your email address can be either encrypted or plain text, depending on the option you've chosen.

FTP Settings
On the FTP Settings panel you should write the specific info needed for receiving the logs. After you have filled in the required info, it's good to use the Test button to see if the settings are OK.
The logs can be uploaded either in the root folder or in any folder you specify. If the folder doesn't exist, it'll be created by the keylogger.
The logs sent to your FTP address can be either encrypted or plain text, depending on the option you've chosen.
The regular FTP port is 21.

Server Options
The Server Options panel gives you few choices to customize the "server" a bit more: server overwriting (the "server" can be overwritten by another "server" which is ran afterwards on the same computer), melting (the original "server" is deleted after the first run), disabling the System Restore, message box configuration (at the first run of the "server" a message is displayed), uninstalling after a specified number of logs sent or when a hotkey is pressed, access restriction, uninstall by checking a specific internet address (if the remote file exists - the address is valid - the "server" will uninstall itself).
The keylogger can be configured to be active after a specified time interval or after the computer restart.
Spytector "server" allows you to restrict the access to specific websites and applications. By clicking the Configure button a new panel shows up and you are able to set the filters for applications and websites. In the case of the applications you have to add the executable name to the proper list (by example if you add 'aim' then 'aim.exe' will be stopped). On the websites list you can add keywords (by example if you add 'porn' to the list then all the websites containing the keyword, like and, will be blocked).
<< back to top
Log Options
On the Log Options panel you can enable the option for the keylogger filter. The keylogger can be active only when a specific window is focused and its title contains the specified keywords. This option comes in handy if you don't want to have the logs filled with junk data.
The dead keys and navigation keys (CTRL, ALT, SHIFT, ESC, PAGE UP, PAGE DOWN, HOME, END, UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) won't be included in the log if the "Clean Log" option is enabled (default setting).
The option for log formatting is enabled by default (whenever BACKSPACE is pressed the last trapped character won't be written to the log). If the Smart Keylogger checkbox is unchecked the log file will contain all the pressed characters and {BACKSPACE} keys.
Spytector keylogger is able to find and decrypt the locally stored passwords for newest versions of FireFox, Opera, Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Safari, GoogleTalk, Outlook, Windows Live Messenger etc. The found passwords are included at the beginning of the logfile once in a boot session.
Spytector keylogger intercepts both sides of chat (messenger conversations) for many versions of the most used chat applications (AIM, ICQ, Yahoo Messenger, MSN Messenger). The whole messenger conversations are included in the logs only if you check the appropriate checkbox.
The URL history is included by default at the beginning of every log received. The default number of URL entries (visited websites) is 20. In the case you're not interested to receive such info just uncheck the appropriate checkbox.
According to your needs, the logs can be received either when they reach a minimum size, at specified minutes interval or at specified days interval. The log delivery on a daily basis works better if the computer is connected all the time to the Internet. If the Internet connection is made automatically at boot (by example when the monitored computer is connecting to Internet through a router that is ON all the time), it is OK to use the daily log delivery. If the connection isn't made automatically, it's better to set the keylogger to send the logs at the specified size.
<< back to top
Log Viewer
The logs can be viewed in a specially designed window included in Spytector, the Log Viewer. If the logs are received on your email address, the easiest method is to copy the email text body to the clipboard and use Paste Log Text button. If the logs are downloaded from your FTP account, then it's more convenient to use Load Log File button. It doesn't matter if the logs are encrypted or plain text, the Log Viewer can handle both types of log.
The different log sections are colored, so the user can easily see the PC activity. Initially, all the sections (Passwords, URL history, Boot, Keystrokes etc.) are put together, with the Passwords on top. From the upper right combo box, the user can choose different sections to view. It's possible to search the log for specific keywords and the search can be executed upwards, downwards, case sensitive and/or for whole words.
From the Log Viewer window, the formatted logs can be saved as RTF or HTML.
Also, in the case you don't use the email or FTP delivery options, it's possible to manually retrieve the local logfiles. On the bottom of Spytector's main window, near the Log Viewer button, is located the Retrieve Local Log option. As the name says, the button must be used to retrieve the local logs. By clicking it, a popup menu with 2 options appears and it's possible either to retrieve the local logs automatically or manually browse for the logs. The log files are stored under a path like "C:\Users\Your-User-Name\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows"). The log files have hidden attributes, so you have to make sure you see the hidden/system files.

Hiya, I’m actually glad I’ve located this information. Today bloggers publish just about gossips and net and that is seriously annoying. A good internet site with thrilling articles, which is what I need to have. Thank you for retaining this website internet site, I’ll be visiting it. Do you need to do newsletters? Can not locate it.Turns out I've spent the most of my Week off school, blogging, eating and doing homework... the joys!
I found a lovely competition to enter on blog page! Amy has teamed up with Next in an exciting competition, to win £500 worth of Next vouchers! The great thing about Next, is that it offers something for everyone! Me and my momma regularly do swaps on Next clothing, and fight over who is aloud to buy which top! So here's my entry! If you fancy having a go for yourself check it out now! All the outfits bellow, can be found on the Next website::) ENJOY X
My first outfit is this lovely Lipsy wax lace shift dress. Just because Winter's here doesn't mean you can't wear your favourite dress with a pair of heals! I love the Gold over wax design, it's so elegant, and perfect for Christmas parties! I've pared it with some glittery heals, as a girls outfit is never complete with a sprinkle of glitter! Accessorize with a black and beaded clutch, and John Richard Vine Necklace, to set your outfit off. Not forgetting a lovely Sparkle Jacket, as let's not forget, it may be hot on the dance floor - but it'll be freezing outside (from personal experience, trust me on this one!). Dress: £70, Shoe's £45, Clutch £35, Necklace £30, Jacket £38.
This next number is a Smart/Casual outfit, simply to make your Autumn as stylish by comfy as possible. I would be no where without my Brogues - and are always a must have! I fell in love with these berry check trousers! They'll look great with the blue blazer and a white shirt, as they keep your outfit looking effortless - and perfect for those of you who want to ditch the heals and skirt at work, for something a little more comfortable! I love a good satchel - so have added one to this outfit, as it complements the tones of the trousers perfectly (and makes me a happy girl)! Trousers £38, Brogues £48, shirt £26, Blazer £60, Satchel £35.
My final outfit choice is this perfect winter selection. I've picked everyone's favourite Winter clothes; the knee high boots, the wooly cardigan, and thick tights to create a great everyday combo. I originally fell in love with the thick Tan Cord Pencil Skirt, as it will look great with brown boots! Then I noticed the tone's of the gorgeous pussy bow shirt, which complemented that of the skirt. I love winter - and this outfit is an example of why! Bring out the Patchwork Cardigan and grey wooly tights, and your prepared for every weather! It's worth spending the money on a good quality pair of boots that will last you right through the winter, and these knee high boots, will always be your favourite wardrobe item! Blouse £28, Cardigan £35, Boots £99, Skirt £24, Tights £12
Well that's it! I'm dying for winter, so I can wear my wooly tights! Make sure you get your entry's in to.

FvkIVOSo post-birthday debauchery yesterday, we hit up Whole Foods and Trader Joe’s – yum! I even got a little premade wrap that I thought was the bomb – Trader Ming’s Thai Style White Meat Chicken Wrap. It was SO good – loved the peanut sauce that went with it and it was super filling with the carrot, cabbage and chicken. Definitely a product I’d pick up again on the go! Once we got home we spent the whole day relaxing, hanging out and watching movies – SO nice!
We watched a few: Year One (no thanks… was kinda funny at first but was just too silly for us and we couldn’t finish it), Paper Heart (I was kind of into it… Austin was not so I’m going to try to watch this again) and Julie & Julia (I FINALLY got to see this – Austin’s mom had been telling me to see it and she was right – I loved it! I thought it was a cute movie and loved, of course, the idea of cooking/blogging a bunch of recipes. I especially enjoyed the Julia Child parts of the movie – so cool to see how she got her start and so late in age – such an inspiration). I ended my lovely Sunday at 1,767 calories, 225 carbs, 57 fat grams and 98 protein grams. Here’s what I ate.
Today started out with an exciting commute – I finished listening to Mary Higgins Clark’s Two Little Girls in Blue. This was a mystery I picked up at B&N last weekend, and what was my first Mary Higgins Clark book! It was about a young family with two twins who have one of their twins abducted. There’s a ransom involved, multiple suspects and more. Honestly, I’m only giving it a 3/5. It was definitely a mystery and the ending surprised me and there were lots of characters who seemed suspicious. It was written well, tied everything up well, etc., but I guess it felt like it was a really long law & order. Maybe I’m just “over” the kidnap/ransom thing and there wasn’t anything different enough about this one to make it interesting. I think the “different” part was supposed to be the twins and their twin talk and how the spared twin helped them find the abducted twin through them talking to each other in their minds or something? And that was interesting… but it didn’t do it for me completely! So I’m glad I read it but I never really got INTO it you know?
After finishing my book I just worked, had some waffles and yogurt, and went down to the gym for 4 miles. After my workout I just worked more and then headed home to cook since I didn’t cook at all yesterday! Eek! I made the following:
- 4 servings of Chicken Fiesta new!
- 4 servings of Taco Bake new!
- 4 servings of 'mexican-flavored ground beef' (plan to use for taco salads and tacos!)
- 6 servings of Brunch Pizza Squares
- 4 servings of four-cheese pepperoni pizza

I just found your blog and have been enjoying reading your story.
I also love to cook healthy and I collect recipes and cook books.
I look forward to your new recipes.
Glad you finally got to see Julie and Julia!! I thought it was pretty cute!! It made me want to cook some of Julia Childs' recipes!!! :)
I've read a lot of Mary Higgins Clark books. They all kinda have the same theme of lost children, etc. Some are better than others.
I liked that movie Julie & Julia a lot.
You are so motivated when it comes to making your meals ahead of time! I need to learn.
I did make a good pasta dish tonight. Recipe is linked to on my blog.
i think i might be the only blogger that does not like the julie & julia movie...I also disliked the book...im such a rebel
Loved Julie and Julia!! Love all the yummy recipes!
I'll have to look for that wrap at TJ's. I don't think I have ever seen it!
I made a cheesy pasta bake with tons of mushrooms and a salad.
I loved Julie and Julia! Such a perfect movie for food bloggers :)
Like all things, running is way more challenging at the beginning! There are still days when I'm not into it, but even then a light jog feels easy. It's all about building up endurance!
Hope you have a great day!!
I love Julie & Julia!!
I read Mary Higgins Clark books for just some down time. They aren't a hard to put down kind of book and can be picked up after a break from reading. So its good for just chillin with nothing to do or some book for you to read while your on vaction with Austin!!!!!!
I WISH WE HAD TRADER JOE'S!!!!! You and Mon talk about it so much that it makes me sad we don't have one :(
I loved Julie & Julia. We did the same thing with Year One too, we turned it off!! I hope you have a great day!!
I've never read her, but my mom used to!
Yeah sometimes runs are just a no-go.
I've never rad MHC, but my Mom and Grandma both love her.
I still haven't seen Julie & Julia! I don't know what I've been waiting for lol!
Grrr when will Florida get a Trader Joe's????
I love Julie and Juila. I've never been able to get into Mary Higgens Clark books. I just ordered one from an author my friend told me about called the Sugar Queen--it's like whimsy and fun and food. It sounds great!
I loved Julie and Julia. How cute is Meryl Streep!?
I have that book but haven't read it yet! Thanks for the review!
Have you read the Pact? If not, you need to!! Sooo sad but so good!
I haven't cooked much today but I plan on making pizza for dinner.
I haven't read Mary Higgins Clark.
I loved, loved, loved Julie & Julia.
I'm not a huge Mary Higgins Clark fan. I have only read maybe two of her books, and like you said, just can't ever really get into them.
I just read Eye Contact that you recommended on here and liked it a lot. And I have Beach Trip to read sometime soon too. I love sharing book ideas!
All of that food you prepped sounds SO good!
I wish I would've liked Julie and Julia but sheesh, I fell asleep! I thought it was SO boring, although meryl streep was SPOT on! she did sucha good job!
I LOVE Mary Higgins Clark...once I start I can rarely stop and will sit there and finish the entire book in one sitting! haha!
Ooooo brunch square recipe please! Also, I need your discipline for making food ahead of time. You are so good!
My mama's obsessed with that movie! I'll have to watch it next time I'm home
I made calzones for dinner and they were excellent! You are a serious cooker. I do the vast majority of my cooking and prep work on Sundays.
Look forward to your new recipes. I tried reading Mary Higgins Clark but just couldn't get into them. I love your book reviews. Have a great evening. :)
So Mary Higgins Clark super freaks me out, because I feel like everyone of her books is about a young woman and a serial killer. Way to make me not sleep at night, MHC!So, being on the fence all week about the race itself was a bit unnerving, and I was pretty much committed to NOT racing until I got to Kids Rock and the Expo today and got caught up in all the energy. My photo opportunities were good, but I didn't take advantage. I saw Adam The
So, the decision was to strap on the Asics this morning and run the 1/2 at about a 9:50 pace. I would have been running with Suzanne, my running partner. What would the calf do???
At the 2am Norman the choc lab potty time, my calf was talking to me in an angry voice and I made the decision to not run. This morning's stumble to the coffee maker confirmed the decision. Bummer but I know that I would have hurt myself more and possibly would have had to ride the golf cart of shame. Got up early anyway and drove two friends down to the metro station so they could ride the train to the start line, and they are still running now. Hope you guys are having a good run and enjoying the scenery.
Meanwhile, Norman, HJG, and Mrs. RTP made our way through our neighborhood to catch the elites.
The course passed about 1/2 mile north of our house. It was overcast and about 50 degrees --perfect. After watching the wheelchair racers go by
we had a short wait and then the elite men came by in a flash. Awesome!!
A bit more of a wait and the first women came by just flying
and then there started the amazing field of fast runners men and women. This was truly fun to watch and made me wish I was out there. I am determined to work this calf back into 20-25 mile weeks and build endurance this year. Had some fun tweets with Lauren and Adam this morning. I guarantee we will be running some trail races and possibly some bi/tri crap this year. I am posted for the Runners Den pancake fun run next weekend, which is designed to be a fun recovery run for those who did the RnR today. Just got a tweet from Suzanne who finished in 2:12!! Great job to all the runners, rollers, and walkers who got out there today!

Sorry the calf said no, but sounds like you made the right decision. Spectating is still pretty fun, though. Although I cannot comment on anatomy, I got to meet Sally earlier this last week. Very excited for her!
never an easy choice, that is for sure. glad you were able to make some lemonade. here's wishing you not only a speedy recovery but a theraputic one as well! peace, yo!

Sometimes cheering sucks, but it's the best decision. Sorry about the calf.
I'm actually with Jamoosh on this one. When you are hurt, spectating is NOT fun.
How is the leg?My name is Iris, I was born and raised in Israel and today I live with my family in the greater D.C. area (Rockville, Maryland).
After finishing my first degree in Education and the second one in Public Administration, I quickly realized that this is not what I REALLY want to do with my life. I felt a need to make closer contact with people, to touch, to give something to others, ease their pain and be there for them. This is when I started my new journey as a Reflexologist.
During my three years of Reflexology studies (where I come from, three years is the standard to become a senior Reflexology therapist), I took additional workshops and courses to become specialized in providing Reflexology treatment to pregnant women, babies and toddlers.
I have more than 17 years of experience, during which I dealt with Women’s Health issues (Infertility, dysmenorrhea, menopause, pregnancy, maternity and labor reflexology), Chronic Health (Chronic pain, lymphatic system, migraines, backache, high blood pressure etc.), Allergies (Asthma, Atopic Dermatitis), Stress, ADD/ADHD and more.
I'm a strong believer that Reflexology can be combined with medical treatment as a complementary therapy method that in most cases can ease our pain and improve our health.
In my Reflexology session I like to take an Holistic treatment approach - We will work together, while focusing on both your body and soul. Your feet can tell me your story, from which I learn about feelings and physical issues that you and your body deal with. Together, we can make this story better.

It’s a wallpaper for Hanako’s newest game titled “Long Live the Queen!”. The game belongs to the genre known as “Visual Novels”. The main character is a princess who must take her just-deceased mother’s place. She must avoid death by mastering political intrigue, magic (if the gamer wishes), and a few other skills.
Lltq: political intrigue
What intrigued me about this game is that I had never heard of the visual novel genre before I saw it. I love games like these!
There’s a catch, though: the demo is free to download (obviously) but the full game costs about $12.95. If you have no intention of buying the full game, the demo might change your mind.

Renter's Insurance for a First Apartment?
by Dollar Stretcher Contributors
Renter's Insurance for a First Apartment?
I found several helpful articles on the Dollar Stretcher site for determining the costs of renting a first apartment, but I did not see much mention of renter's insurance. Is this something I should be considering? I am getting ready to move into my first apartment, and although I do not have too many possessions at this time, I wonder if I would be wise to go ahead and get it. Or would it just be a waste of money at this point? I do have student loans I am working to pay off, so my budget is a little tight. What would other renters suggest? If you have renter's insurance, have you found it worth the cost, even if just for the peace of mind?
Michael
Pay for the Renter's Insurance
A friend of mine did not get renter's insurance for her apartment. Another tenant's unit caught on fire, and the whole apartment building burned to the ground. My friend was home with her husband and her baby. They had to climb out of a window and down a tree. The only things they had left were themselves and their car. She had to replace furniture and clothing, but also little things like scissors. She said that it was so difficult to replace it all and really regrets not paying for the insurance. It feels like you do not have much until it is all gone and have to replace it all.
Beth
Insurance May Be Required
While some apartments still say renter's insurance is optional, there are many apartments are now saying you must have renter's insurance. Get it with the same company you have your car insurance with and you'll get a discount.
Betty M.
Absolutely Buy Renter's Insurance
It is relatively inexpensive and will not only provide peace of mind but also pay off if you are robbed, have a fire, or someone is injured in your first apartment. I bought when I was young, on a budget, and paying student loans.
Barbara
Temporary House if First Apartment Is Lost
Renter's insurance covers your belongings for theft and loss due to fire. Although you don't have much, you should consider what it would cost to replace everything if there is a fire. Also, where would you go if you lost everything? Insurance generally covers temporary housing until you get back on your feet after a loss. Renter's insurance is usually very inexpensive. Call a couple of independent agents to get prices. At that point, you can decide what is best for you based on your needs and income.
Cindy
Cover Your Electronics
If you have any electronics (laptop, iPhone, etc.), these would be covered. Renter's insurance is not that expensive because you are just insuring the contents. Imagine replacing all of your clothes and shoes. When we were renters many years ago, we lived in three separate places that had fires near our unit. You cannot always control the apartments around you (candles, grills, etc.). I say peace of mind is worth the small cost they will charge you.

Need Renter's Coverage If Someone Is Hurt in First Apartment
Every renter should have renter's insurance. Not only does it cover replacing your furniture, dishes, clothing, etc., but it also covers staying at a hotel and eating out if your place is uninhabitable, liability insurance if someone is injured at your place, and items stolen from your home or car.
J & B
Could You Replace All Possessions In Your First Apartment?
As far as buying renter's insurance, some building complexes require all renters to purchase it. The landlord should state in the lease if it's required. If it's not, the lease may state that all possessions of the renter are the renter's responsibility if a hazard (fire, earthquake, etc.) should occur that damages the possessions.
Therefore, see if it's a requirement first. If not, check to see how much a policy would cost versus the cost of replacing all of your possessions. If it's within your budget and at a reasonable price, then buy it.
RU
Shop Around and Do the Math
Landlord's have landlord insurance to cover the cost of the structure. Renter's insurance merely covers your belongings in the place you rent in the event it is destroyed. Compare the replacement cost to the cost of the renter's insurance. If it costs more than it would to replace the items, then just put the money you would use for the insurance aside. On the other hand, if it costs more to replace the items than the insurance, it may be worth the money. Shop around and do the math to make a wise decision

Advice From an Insurance Agent and a Renter
I just rented my first apartment, and I am also an insurance agent. I would highly recommend getting renter's insurance. If you already have auto insurance, I recommend checking into renter's insurance through them as many times you will receive a discount on your auto policy that almost pays for the renter's insurance policy. Also something most do not know is that a good renter's insurance policy will also help reimburse you for expenses incurred if you have to leave your apartment due to a fire or other severe damage. This in itself has helped many of my customers. My policy covers me for $30,000 on contents, and I pay about $100 for the year.

Researchers are investigating whether a simple eye test could be used to identify the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease.
A three-year £1.1 million project will look at whether warning signs can be detected using special computer software to analyse high-definition images of the eye.
Evidence suggests that changes in the patterns of ocular veins and arteries can be linked to other disease such as stroke and cardiovascular disease.
A team at the University of Dundee’s school of computing have developed the software – known as Vampire – with colleagues at the University of Edinburgh.
Project co-ordinator Emanuele Trucco, professor of computational vision at the University of Dundee,.”
Researchers will compare measurements of thousands of images with medical histories stored at Dundee’s Ninewells Hospital to see if a relationship can be established.
Mr Trucco said: “When changes occur in some parts of the body, you can see differences in the retinal vessels, e.g. in width, some vessels become thinner; some become larger; differences in the tortuosity, or how wriggly the vessels become; there are also differences in the angles when vessels split in two.
“These measurements can indicate a huge amount but to take them by hand is an extremely time-consuming, tedious process.
“The Vampire software interface allows researchers to take these measures repeatedly, reliably, and efficiently even when working with a large number of images.”
The Engineering and Physical Science Research Council (EPSRC) has funded the project as part an £8 million investment in research at 11 UK universities..”

In the last 18 months the elementary needs were fulfilled: Water and electricity were made available, the use of the building was ensured, the rooms were renovated; teaching and instruction materials – not present up to this time - were given as well as dresses and books for the students. The recognition of the government of Andhra Pradesh concerning to the school is also a part of these elementary equipments; we are going to receive it in the very next time.
All the teachers receive daily English coaching; they take part in "summer camps" during the holidays and in workshops concerning to different subjects as well. Further more they took additional responsibilities in the school life like caring for the library which is being structured, the laptop and the new teaching and instruction materials. Education in Human Values, meditation, yoga, painting and drawing, games and handling with the computer became regular contents in our school expressing the education with head, heart and hands which is our endeavor.
Last not least sufficient salaries are also a part of our changes since 2006. I am happy that it is possible to pay fitting salaries to our teachers starting in 2008. Here is a survey on the new salaries:
As a part of a teacher workshop the teachers painted their "ideal school". Basing on these pictures the group wrote a list of the priorities which is exhibited at the notice board of the school as well as the paintings:
The teachers’ paintings are very different, but they have in common that we need more space! Since December we are trying to find out whether it is possible that the school can extend to the neighbor properties. Two pieces of land are available, but their size is not sufficient; and the second piece of land is in some distance to the school. The prices are also very high because our school is located in the center of Mudigubba. So we came to the opinion that it makes sense to start a new school. We are planning to buy a bigger piece of land at the boarder of Mudigubba and to build new buildings. Of course we need the help of some donors to realize this vision!
The visit of two "Nature Schools" strengthened this point of view. The Timbaktu Collective in Anantapur District, Andhra Pradesh () built up child like and organically structured schools: seven schools in Anantapur District. All the teachers of the Shanti Ananda School visited two of these schools and are fascinated and enchanted of them.
Headmaster Chandra Mohan in front of a building of the Nature School
In the Nature Schools the students are only in the morning busy with the traditional subjects generally defined as “education”. In the afternoons they learn weaving, handling electricity and agriculture, stitching, cooking etc. On the big and also very attractive area of the first “Nature School” one small house was built up by the students themselves – one example for the ability of the students to practice “living skills”.
The problem of most of the schools in this country and also at other places is that children with practical oriented talents are very disadvantaged; they have to sup- press their abilities in favor of theoretic and often boring teachings. Many of these children resign, fall into apathy and are no longer able to learn anything. That means in the consequence that they learn nothing because they are not able to learn the traditional skills useful for the life as well. They don’t have the time and the opportunity to do anything else because of the strict timetable of many schools (in the daytime “education” and in the evening “tuition”). Their future fate probably will be poverty. The Nature Schools took this need and concreted wonderful schools finding the full acceptance of the teachers of the Shanti Ananda School. The students of these schools are intelligent and cheerful and seem to be able to master their lives. They are able to handle the “normal” subjects as well as to work in a team; they are self confident and creative.
View to the school area and a learning group
At the second „Nature School“ a „Children’s Center“ is located. Children coming from other schools and from the village can use it as well as the students of this school. They can borrow books from the voluminous library and also take part in courses „How to handle a computer“ or learn how to stitch, to do embroidery and other handicrafts. A big range of products made by children invites the visitors to buy some items for taking home as key holders, toys, dresses, jewelries etc. The children learn many techniques of handicrafts they can always rely on. Further more the school receives funds by selling these products.
On the next photo groups of children can be seen producing notice boards, cro- cheting and painting. All the walls of this big group room are painted by children only. They prepare food, are busy in the agriculture; they are busy with everything useful in the practical life: "Non scholae, sed vitae discimus “ (We don’t learn for the school, but for the life)!
Group room in the Nature School
On February 15th a parents’ meeting is planned in the Shanti Ananda School con- cerning to the future vision and our prospects. All the teachers are very inspired by the visit of the “Nature School” and want our school develop into a similar di- rection. But we need the support of our parents to be able to do this. So it is very necessary to convince our parents – most of them are very simple persons – of the need of such an education.
Our "Kinder garden“ – up to this time it is not really one – is in the focus of our awareness as well. Our endeavor is to integrate more childlike sense oriented and movement oriented elements into the daily structure. At least the children play with artificial clay twice a week; and a big box with wooden blocks made by a carpenter in Puttaparthy is used daily; some puzzles and construction games complete our offer still very modest. In the next teacher workshops the main matter will be how to improve the quality of the kinder garden. "Small children need a lot of sense experience for their personal development. They smell, taste, feel, see and hear to get known of themselves as well as of their surroundings… They can play the same game ten times, twenty times or one hundred times without feeling bored. Their playing is not simply a time pass but it is necessary for them to ac- quire new skills and abilities. Every child wants to develop itself and trains a special action as long as it is able to do it in a sufficient way… All the children want to develop themselves. But not every child is able to control the steps of its development. Some children have some problems, they need more time or more support.“ (Y. Ellneby: Die Entwicklung der Sinne – Wahrnehmungsförderung im Kindergarten, S. 7).
Small children playing with the wooden blocks
Our students accepted the medium of the "drama“ or theatre play as their own medium also in their free time. Every time when I come to the school they perform some dances, songs and small theatre scenes.

5/ 5Good productI have a 2013 FreeRide bar that I use with my 2013 12m Razor. (Excellent kite BTW). I’ve used it 3 times so far. I’m losing all the skin on my fingers when using the bar. I have kited for over 6 years and use other manufacturers’ bars without having this problem. Is there some sort of new neoprene or glue that is being used on the 2013 OR bar that is hard on the skin of your hands? It’s really odd. I have almost no fingerprints at this point. It’s only occurring where my hands/fingers contact the bar.
Anyone else experiencing something like this?Right here on the West Coast, Baxter of California has prided itself in offering the finest of men's grooming tools and shaving supplies.

You can read the entire initiative here [pdf document]. And yes, it does call for the out of competition testing for EPO's that John Sabini was so hesitant about the other day.
In fact, all of the rules and regulations proposed seem worthy. Problem is of course that NTRA has no real means to enforce the regulations it proposes.
Alex Waldrop, the chief executive of the NTRA, said that benefits from the certification program will be "market-driven," contending that racetracks that comply with the program will draw a larger share of wagering dollars than those that do not. He acknowledged, however, that the NTRA - a marketing and lobbying organization that draws the bulk of its funding from tracks and horsemen's organization - has no power to enforce the rules.Ah, the "marketplace" approach. We've seen how well that's been working out of late. Whatsmore, NTRA has selected Tommy Thompson, the Republican former governor of Wisconsin, secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services for the W. Administration, and, briefly, candidate for President of the United States. Hopefully, Thompson is recovered from the case of brainlock he developed during the latter, when he told a Jewish group that earning money is "sort of part of the Jewish tradition."
"The market will determine that it's valuable to be accredited," Waldrop said. "We can't make them do it. But if they don't they're out of the alliance." [DRF]
Thompson also said during one of the GOP presidential debates that it's OK for an employer opposed to homosexuality to fire a gay worker. Later, he explained that he misunderstood the question, and that he wasn't feeling very well.
."Oh man. Well, this should be good for a few yuks if nothing else.
[UPDATE: More on Thompson over at Not to the Swift.]
3 Comments:
The ultimate solution is very simple. Now that the NTRA and all the alphabet agencies and major racetracks are comfortable with the objectives of the undertaking, create a federally chartered private company to regulate/oversee/manage, whatever term you want to use, the effort. Use the 1978 Interstate Gaming Act as the tool, so if a racetrack's simulcast signal is transmitted across state lines, the rules of this new national racing company must be in place. No opting in or if you don't get in the public may not bet, just a uniform set of rules and practices that are mandatory. Why would the racing Pu-Bahs disagree if this "charter" accomplishes all their collective goals? I can wait no longer as the same old foxes seek to maintain control of the henhouse.
The "safety" initiative is particularly weak, focusing on protection of jockeys as opposed to the equine athlete.
I copy/paste the following, this from the same NTRA and AAEP that refuse to support the the ban of horse slaughter and transporation to and from the houses ;
"Aftercare for Retired Racehorses. Alliance members will commit to a nation-wide aftercare
system for our retired racehorses that meets the guidelines established by the American
Association of Equine Practitioners. The Alliance and the horseracing industry as a whole share
in the responsibility for providing care and retraining for racehorses after they can no longer
compete on the racetrack."
Rules without consequences are suggestions. If the NTRA doesn't have anything stronger than not being part of the "ALLIANCE" to wield, they will not effect anyone's behavior. Of course, given the NTRA's role as PR platform for the current status quo, who would expect them to actually try to tell tracks, trainers, or owners what to do? This Alliance lacks Integrity.If we say:
<script>
setTimeout("window.status = '7 seconds';",7000);
</script>
Then within seven seconds, the phrase 7 seconds will appear on the status bar. Follow this link to see this in action. Better still, we could write a function to set the status bar for us, and use setTimeout to run that function at the appropriate time.
<script>
function ChangeStatus(x) {
window.status = x + " seconds" ;
}
setTimeout("ChangeStatus(3);",3000);
setTimeout("ChangeStatus(10);",10000);
setTimeout("ChangeStatus(7);",7000);
</script>
One advantage of this is that quite complicated things can be done to the status bar using a single command to call the function. Follow this link to see this example in action. Here, the status bar changes three times: at 3 seconds, then at 7 seconds, and finally at 10 seconds.
But what if we want the status bar to change continually? It is not practical to put in an infinite number of setTimeout commands:
<script>
function ChangeStatus(x) {
window.status = x + " seconds" ;
}
setTimeout("ChangeStatus(1);",1000);
setTimeout("ChangeStatus(2);",2000);
setTimeout("ChangeStatus(3);",3000);
setTimeout("ChangeStatus(4);",4000);
:
:
setTimeout("ChangeStatus(17724);",17724000);
setTimeout("ChangeStatus(17725);",17725000);
setTimeout("ChangeStatus(17726);",17726000);
:
:
</script>
This would take far too long to type! And far too long to load into the browser!
A much better solution is to use the ChangeStatus (or whatever) function to not only change the status, but also to start a new timer running at the same time. Consider carefully the following example:
<script>
function TimeUntilY2K() {
various commands to calculate how many seconds until the year 2000;
}
function SetStatus(x) {
window.status = "Only " + x + " seconds until the year 2000!!!" ; // This sets the status
x = x - 1;
command = "SetStatus(" + x + ");" ; // This prepares to set the status again with a
setTimeout(command,1000) ; // new value of x in one second's time.
}
x = TimeUntilY2K(); // Find out how long until the year 2000
SetStatus(x); // Set the status bar to show that number.
</script>
Here we have a function called TimeUntilY2K() which calculates the number of seconds until 0:00:00 on the 1st January 2000. We won't concern ourselves with the details of this function here.
The next function is called SetStatus, and it takes one argument, a number x. It first sets the status bar, to warn the user how much time until Y2K, using the command
window.status = "Only " + x + "seconds until the year 2000!!!" ;
The number x is then reduced by one, and then a string called command is produced. This string is supposed to be the command to call SetStatus with the new value of x. For example, suppose you gave the command
SetStatus(3210)
Then, inside the function SetStatus, the variable x starts off with the value "3210". The window.status is changed to read "Only 3210 seconds until the year 2000!!!".
Then, x is reduced by 1, to become "3209", and the string command then becomes "SetStatus(3209)". Finally, this string command is given to the setTimeout command, via
setTimeout(command,1000)
so that the new SetStatus command is given one second after the first one finishes. In this way, the status bar will change every second, showing a smaller and smaller number of seconds each time it changes. follow this link to see this example in action.
Actually, this is not the best way to put a millennium countdown clock on the status bar. It will lose about 3 minutes every hour, and reach 0 on about the 14th of January (if you left your computer on that long!)
A more common way people use window.status together with setTimeout is to have a scrolling status bar. Consider the function below:.
}
This function takes one argument, a string s. The first thing it does is to set the status bar to s, using the command window.status = s. Then, it does some strange operations on s, before setting a new Timeout. Let's look more closely at these operations.
The first command given is
head = s.slice(0,1);
This will in fact, slice off all the characters after the 0'th, until the 1st. In other words, it just slices off just the first character of s. It then copies that first character into the variable head. Note that s is not changed during this process.
The next command given is very similar:
tail = s.slice(1,s.length);
this will slice off all characters of s after the 1st, and until the character number s.length (the length of s - in other words, all of s except the first character. This will then be stored in tail. Again, s is not affected by this process.
For example, if s is the string "Welcome to Javascript!! ", then after these two commands head would contain just the letter "W", and tail would contain the string "elcome to Javascript!! ".
Next, the command
s = tail + head;
Will join these two strings back together, but in the wrong order! In other words, s would become the string "elcome to Javascript!! W".
The command command = "Scroll( '" + s + "' );" ;
will then join the string "Scroll( '" to the new s, and then to the string "' );", yielding "Scroll( 'elcome to Javascript!! W' );".
This Javascript command is then given to setTimeout, ready to be done 0.05 seconds later. When the timer runs out, the whole process is repeated. Roughly 20 times per second!
The only visible change to the screen will be that the status bar changes each time. This is what the user will see:
Command: Scroll("Welcome to Javascript!! "); -> Status bar: Welcome to Javascript!!
Command: Scroll("elcome to Javascript!! W"); -> Status bar: elcome to Javascript!! W
Command: Scroll("lcome to Javascript!! We"); -> Status bar: lcome to Javascript!! We
Command: Scroll("come to Javascript!! Wel"); -> Status bar: come to Javascript!! Wel
Command: Scroll("ome to Javascript!! Welc"); -> Status bar: ome to Javascript!! Welc
Command: Scroll("me to Javascript!! Welco"); -> Status bar: me to Javascript!! Welco
Command: Scroll("e to Javascript!! Welcom"); -> Status bar: e to Javascript!! Welcom
And so on and on... the effect of this will be that the words appear to scroll smoothly across the status bar!
In Example 7d, the following commands are used to start the message going:
message1 = "Welcome to the Web Page Design Workshop at SIT. ";
message2 = "I hope you are all learning a lot! ";
message3 = "Soon you will all have really snazzy web pages!!!! ";
message = message1 + message2 + message3 ;
Scroll(message);
The command message = message1 + message2 + message3 ; creates a very long string (message) by joining together the three shorter ones. This longer message is then scrolled smoothly across the bottom of the screen. Follow this link to see this example in action.Everythingdiscgolf

Australia, Eventing team gold medallists in Barcelona 1992, Atlanta 1996 and Sydney 2000, heads both the team and individual standings in Olympic Eventing after a day of cross-country thrills, spills and surprises at the Rio 2016 Olympic Equestrian Venue in Deodoro today, topping the teams on 150.3 and with Christopher Burton in pole position in the individual rankings with Santano II.
But their neighbours from New Zealand are stalking them closely going into tomorrow’s final showjumping phase, just 4.5 penalties adrift, with the French in hot pursuit in overnight bronze a further 6.2 off the pace.
Germany, London 2012 team gold medalists and leaders after dressage, dropped to fourth on 172.8, while Britain’s William Fox-Pitt plummeted from pole position on the individual leaderboard to 22nd after a runout at the final element of the Ski Jump at fence 20 on a course that all the riders agreed was an enormous test. The statistics tell the tale of a tough day at the office, with eight of the 13 teams reduced to just three team-members, and USA and Russia no longer in contention after retirements and eliminations.
Only Brazil, France and Great Britain will have full four-member sides as tomorrow’s action begins, provided all goes well in the early-morning horse inspection.
It was clear from the outset that the 33-fence track would prove hugely influential, and with three of the first eight riders biting the dirt it more than lived up to expectations.
Sam Griffiths got the Australians off to the perfect start however when cruising home with the lovely Irish mare, Paulank Brockagh, with only 6.8 time penalties to add to his dressage score, and when Burton and his super-talented nine-year-old, Santano ll, produced one of just three zero scores on the day then things were looking even better. That was reinforced by another great run from Stuart Tinney and Pluto Mio who put just 2.8 time penalties on the board, so even though Shane Rose was eliminated late on the track with CP Qualified they still went out in front at the end of the day.

With New Zealand pathfinder Tim Price out of the picture after a slip-up on the flat, the remaining Kiwis had no choice but to keep it together and they succeeded brilliantly, the legendary Sir Mark Todd (Leonidas ll), Clarke Johnstone (Balmoral Sensation) and Tim Price’s wife, Jonelle Price (Faerie Dianimo) each collecting just time faults to leave them on a scoreline of 154.80.
Meanwhile Astier Nicolas (Piaf de B’Neville) set up the French with a fault-free run so they could drop the 50.40 collected by Karim Laghouag (Entebbe) who ran into trouble at the first of the two angled brush fences at 12. Team-mate Thibaut Valette (Qing du Briot) also faulted at this one but came home with a relatively modest 24.4 penalties to add, while Mathieu Lemoine (Bart L), individually third after dressage, took a careful tour of the track, and the final team tally of 161.00 was good enough for overnight third.
The German dream of a third successive team title took a hammering despite a brilliant clear from defending team and individual Olympic champion Michael Jung (Sam) when Julia Krajewski (Samourai du Thot) was eliminated, so mistakes from Sandra Auffarth (Opgun Louvo) and Ingrid Klimke (Bob) had to be taken into account to drop the team from first to fourth.
But Jung (40.9 penalties) is stalking individual leader, Burton (37.6), very closely and with less than a single fence advantage the 34-year-old Australian will be under extreme pressure tomorrow. Frenchman Nicolas is just 1.1 penalty points further behind in third while Kiwi, Todd (46.0) just shades America’s Philip Dutton (Mighty Nice) on 46.8 and Boyd Martin (Blackfoot Mystery), 50.9 in fifth and sixth. Burton said his horse is “very inexperienced” so he took some longer options on the course, “but the horse is so fast. I couldn’t believe it….he is a rocket!”
Sensationally, Brazil’s Carlos Parro has rocketed up all the way from 33rd place after dressage to hold equal-seventh spot with New Zealand’s Clarke Johnston (Balmoral Sensation). Riding Summon up the Blood, and on a day when so many of the major stars of the sport failed to find the key to the course set by Frenchman Pierre Michelet, the 37-year-old Brazilian, 236th in the world rankings, will be taking on the very best in the battle for Olympic glory. And his team is lying fifth ahead of The Netherlands in sixth as the new day begins.
As the competition unfolded today, riders quickly learned from those who went before them, but tackling the many complex questions on the course still proved a difficult task. The reality was that only a speedy run on the direct routes would be fully rewarded, but that meant risking a glance-off or stop if the skinny combination obstacles in particular didn’t come up right. In all there were 15 eliminations and two retirements while 38 of the 65 starters collected fence penalties.
Of the top 18 riders going into tomorrow’s showjumping phase, the first three all completed today without adding anything to their dressage score and the remainder picked up only time penalties. In all, 27 horse-and-rider combinations had clear jumping rounds and this group included some very special horses like the 10-year-old gelding, The Duke of Cavan, who carried Japan’s Oiwa Yoshiaki through the extremely challenging double of brush corners at fence six on the direct route to slot into 17th spot, and the super-honest 13-year-old Ranco who wasn’t going to be rushed but who did himself and his Chilean rider, Carlos Lobos Munoz, justice as he carefully negotiated the entire track to finish 30th.
Astier Nicolas (FRA) and Piaf de B'Neville (Photo: Arnd Bronkhorst).
French pathfinder Nicolas Astier was just third to go today with Piaf de B’Neville and returned clear within the time. "It was such a good feeling. I realised the pressure - I had to do well for my team-mates, and that's a huge feeling. I didn't expect to have such stress and joy for the team competition. It's a very demanding course and there's never a place to drop your reins and let him breathe” he said after moving up from 11th to third place.
Michael Jung’s clear promoted him to silver medal spot, but he said he didn’t have an easy time before he set off on his cross-country run. "The warm-up was difficult on Sam's nerves. The loudspeakers, horses galloping by, the cheering spectators. He was already sweaty in the stables. He was overly motivated in the beginning but nevertheless wonderful. He gave me a good feeling and was still fresh at the finish line and staying inside the time was easier than I expected”, he explained.
Mark Todd said "I had instructions from the team to stay safe and clear. Fence six had me worried but it was mostly a perfect round. The horse (Leonidas ll) was brilliant all the way through. I was told to take one long route and briefly thought 'do I disregard the order?' But then I thought I should better behave myself!”
Individual leader, Christopher Burton, said this evening that finding himself in gold medal spot going into the final day “has far exceeded my expectations!” He’s not getting too carried away however. “My horse is good at dressage and I was told to take one long route and it worked out, so I’m just going to enjoy today and for tomorrow? Whatever….”
Course designer, Pierre Michelet, felt he had provided plenty of different options for the riders to get themselves around the track. “You could change your mind and take a different route if you needed it” he said, “but I was surprised there were a lot of run-outs and dramatic things happening!”
Sir Mark Todd summed it all up this evening. “I want to thank Pierre for building this course because if he hadn’t then we (New Zealand) wouldn’t be in silver medal position tonight! The course offered alternatives to everyone, it was perfectly jumpable but if you wanted to made a medal position then you had to go direct and fast.”
The next hurdle to cross is the final horse inspection at 08.00 tomorrow morning before the medal-deciding showjumping phase of Eventing which will begin at 10.00.I didn’t get the chance to blog last night because my daughter cheered at her 2nd game. She is more important, so I’m updating now. I’ll just give you the highlights, and hope you will read it for yourself. Let me know your thought too.
1. I was surprised when Abraham laughed to himself in disbelief as God told him Sarah would give him a child. Even though he had doubts, he still obeyed God.
2. Genesis 18:14 Is anything too hard for the Lord?
3. I questioned Lot and his intentions when he offered his daughters to such wicked men. Do you think he was banking on them not being interested in her?
4. I love that the angel grabbed Lot’s hand and his wife’s and rushed them out of the city. How cool is that?
5. The faith of Abraham has always stunned me when God asks him to sacrifice Isaac. I wish I could say I would be just like him, but I know I would honestly argue with God. What I’ve never really paid attention to is Isaac. I mean, he asks where the sacrificial animal is and Abraham tells him that God will provide, but then Abraham straps him on the altar. Isaac didn’t resist! It was then that God intervened.
6. Jacob deceives Esau for his birthright but Esau saw what he wanted and exaggerated starvation. Instant gratification early on in the bible! Esau didn’t stop to think about the consequences.
7. Isaac follows his fathers footsteps-tell them you are my sister. Was he shaped by his father?
8. Jacob deceives a second time when he listens to Rebekah and gets Isaac to bless him.
Ok, you go read it and come back so we can talk about it!What is anxiety disorder and panic attacks
What is a panic attack is a question that is not asked by people. This is because , more often that not ,people are unaware of the symptoms of an anxiety attack. They truly don’t know what constitutes a panic attack. A panic attack could be defined as an involuntary anxious bout of fear or apprehension. One might experience sudden pounding of the heart and feeling of breathlessness. A person undergoing a panic attack needs to be aware of the same so as to cure it before it turns into a severe disorder. In the next few paragraphs we will see what to do for a panic anxiety attack.
Help for panic attacks and anxiety
The foremost things that helps with anxiety attacks is to first accept that you are having an anxiety attack. As soon as that is clear, it is imperative that you focus on our breath. Once you realise that you response to any situation or event is an anxiety disorder, you need to simply sip a glass of water and take deep breaths. The breathing in question is what is referred to as abdominal breathing (See Video). An anxiety disorder is not a mental illness and therefore it need not be hidden from friends or family. Instead it is advised to be open about it so that timely interventions in lifestyle and attitude can be made either through counselling, Yoga, change in food habits, among others.
Symptoms of a panic attack or anxiety attack
To begin with, just make sure that you don’t step back from daily life. If the occurrence of panic attacks drains you and dissuades you from going about your regular chores, make sure that you start identifying the triggers. What you can do is to watch out for the signs of a panic or anxiety attack. Be watchful for any abnormal palpitations, breaking out into sweat, tremors, drying of mouth, constriction in throat, sweating, premonition of any untoward incident. The intensity and duration might vary from seconds to hours but it can last for about 30 minutes if you do not address it immediately.
How to help with panic attacks
The following suggestions are aimed at helping you prevent and eliminate panic or anxiety attacks using simple lifestyle practices. If implemented as a part of life, these will help you deal with panic attacks and anxiety and also reduce or eliminate these over a period of time
A sound mind in a sound body makes sure that anxiety, stress or a sense of lack of control does not come your way. So the first step is to be in control of your thoughts.
Be aware of the fact that your breath is the be all and end all of your life, literally! So the fuller your breath, the better you are in control of yourself – your thoughts, your speech and your actions.
Follow a daily regimen that includes such stress- relieving activities as exercise, Yoga, Running, Jogging or simply waking up few minutes early and observing the rising sun.
Sound and restful sleep goes a long way in alleviating feeling of anxiety and depression. Make it a habit to recount the days activities, focusing on the small events that brought a smile on your face. If you are unable to list anything worth recounting, don’t despair. Just remember that you are alive and in a bed – these small reminders shall make you realise that you are indeed better off than a lot of people.
Eating regular, healthy meals is another important aspect of stress-free living. Make sure that you watch yourself for any bouts of binge eating or comfort food eating. These are early indicators of depression or stress. So make sure that you are aware of your Body Mass Index (BMI) and weight. You need to take in only those many calories as are required for your healthy living. Excess calories are bound to make your sluggish and prone to feelings or laziness, lethargy and helplessness. ‘A moment on your lips and forever on your hips’ is not just a funny line. It actually works like that if you do not eat consciously. Keep yourself hydrated through frequent sips of water throughout the day.
Excess of everything is bad and therefore moderation has to be your key mantra. A disciplined, healthy, lifestyle that focuses on your mental, emotional, physical and spiritual well-being will give you the kind of rock-solid foundation that no event or person can shake.
The more you invest in yourself, the more you will gain. So make sure that you are the only protagonist of your life. Know that you are the owner of your life. Your response to any situation is in your hand. This knowledge is what can help you avoid any panic attacks. A situation is only as powerful as you allow it to be. So be careful of your response to the situation and it will surely turn into your best interest.
The most important thing to remember is to PAUSE as soon as you feel the onset of a panic attack. This can be achieved in myriad ways. You can sip a glass of water, count up to ten or even hundred, take few deep breaths or simply curb the urge to respond immediately. If possible, walk away from the situation, perhaps a short walk to the loo! Remember it is a feeling and if you do not allow it to linger, it will die down. Don’t feed the demon by staying put. Make a note of the situation and let it be. Know that you are in charge and can take action to undo any damage.
Panic attack or anxiety, be it in the form of stage fright, presentation, speaking to a partner, dating, meeting new clients, networking, job interviews, hospital check-ups, project deadline delays, financial loss, emotional triggers, ragging, bullying, fear of the unforeseen, lasts as long as you feel that you are powerless. So the best way to get over that feeling is that once you have paused and got yourself centred, envision the worst case scenario. More often than not, we realise that we can live through that and with that realisation comes the power to beat any panic.Daily Light Devotions - June 10 - Morning

Not many days later, the younger son gathered all he had and took a journey into a far country, and there he squandered his property in reckless living. 1

5 Rom 5:8,10You are two souls in one body. One must come out, the other must be disembodied. You must decide and be determined to remove yourself from the feelings of hopelessness. This feeling is a temporary disease. In this present regime of Mr.Silanyo, I always have an intuition that all things will fall apart and will crumble soon or later. The feeling of being unnoticed and forgotten. That is why I am seeking ways to innovate and create. My destiny and career is on the waiting list. Sometimes, when all the bad stuff gets in your way, it can be hard to remember the good things. That may happen to bring us morally down, but there is always a positive side to every situation. Poets and Artist like Professor Hadrawe, Gariye the Great and Abwan Abdi Qais are especially great at feeding you with the silver lines, and golden verses that can heal our bruises and wounds. Brainwashes us from the disgusting remarks of threat and intimidations of our own Nazi minister of propaganda Mr. Joseph slogans. They were the stimulant and the catalyst that increased the speed of our past uprising and present upheaval. Their stimulating and encouraging golden verses and silver lines had inspired us to revolt against the late savage vampire. Always, the pen writes and acts as a window of relief, and assumed as a pain killer to any heavy burden of anxiety and depression. Whether it is about a Nation, a friend, or a political point of view, or life in general. The poetry power of the above poets and their tip – guides had helped us to learn how to face and challenge more about life diversity; and had inspired us you to fight back and revolt against merciless regime. Had made it easy how to find solution of the puzzle of life. Healed our wounds by empowering us with their magic power, and natural herbs for medication. Taught us how to open fresh eyes that faces that terrible tragedy which the hard days lay out, and had enabled us to challenge it with esteem and courage. ( Dalka Waan Aqaana Bahal Iga Da Weynoo Dad Cuni Ma Jooge, Ma Dide Hargoolo, iga Durbaanad Iyo Daasada Madhan. ) Those three pioneers and many others with the heavy grey hairs are my ebony tree that I use it as a shelter in my days of doom and gloom. I learned many fruitful saga from them; more than I had learned from the school books. During any epoch marked by a notable event. As a means to heal my wounds and soften my headache, stomach pain and had enabled me to fight and face the enemy with Iron – Guts. No matter what strife I may encounter , no matter how life may shift; and how much I suffer with those, bad twist and turns of life circumstances.
Their empowering poetry verses whispers in to my ears, by saying. ” If you become resilient and obstinate. Light always shines brighter in the darkest tunnels at the final round. No matter how sappy and miserable life may act. They had given me the guts and courage, Just to ignore and toss the sadness; and then lately, at the end I open my eyes while indulging in an awesome and beautiful life dreams. Hearing my wife singing sweet positive songs .
Hoping her child will experience a better tomorrow. Walking down the busy streets of Hargeisa. Surrounded by melodious voices, low and deep, high and sweet. ”
Dear reader, before three decades ago, sometime in Feb 1982. The first flame of freedom was lit by some daring men composed of teachers, doctors, Gov’t employees and students. At that time our World was divided, and all people were split into two camps. A fragile – camp of Armed struggle was composed of daring views, and with iron guts. They left their destitute home, that shabby, lumbering shack. Dragging their toddlers with shivering hands because of fear and cold. Deserted everything dear and gold. Helpless, Scared, mentally disturbed and fearful kids holding the apron strings of their mothers swarmed the streets of Hargeisa. This movement of struggle was started with the lack of change and evolution of vision to rehabilitate those absurd notions. To revolt and react with force, the shackles of slavery and humiliation. Every day, hour, and every minute of the present days , reminds us those daring men who had sacrificed with bone and blood and had paved this path of tranquility and stability. So that now, we can stroll in a peace of mind and indulge the harvest of those daring men, on these present tranquil and peaceful streets. But the ignorance will never lessen the pain, when we thrive on cultivated misconceptions. The scars will remain the same, and the roots will get decayed. Mr.Silanyo, don’t worry, I won’t ask or beg for your attention. But my words will demand for more blush of embarrassment and shame; and more fury of wild and passionate anger. Mr. Laab – Salaax, you and your choir singers are a body with two souls. I want back my empathic approval and applause. Give me back my hug and kiss. You are a betrayal under the mask of mischief. Mr. Hassan, a poem is a spoken words with gravitational magnitude and phrases that projects, on to the minds of the listeners; like vivid images of sounds and tuned musical harmony. That reflects the inspirations, torture or pain, and sincere feelings of a certain people in a certain time and place.
If your poem is rich with boundless imagination and true feelings, with tasty flavor that touches where the shoe pinches. Your listeners will see, smell, feel , and may be even taste your drawings on their clip – board. Their minds will hold those dreams that obey no boundary, and will apply a will power that couldn’t be broken. Then justice and truth will come in the name of love. Fighting in the power of poetry, is not a crime or violence. You will hear the voices and cries of millions that are agonized by pain, fear and terror of that funny dictator or king. Singing and chanting those silky verses like yours that reflects their pain, their reflections, hope and dreams. Hatred fired in their eyes and abrupt like angry volcano. When the cracks gets longer, and the work gets harder. Then that dictator will know , what is fair and justices. Then they will realize that everyone is being loved in God’s eyes. Does justices and rights have a color, ethnic, or a gender? Mr. Silanyo knows but he can’t see the pain. I asked him if I could sit under the shade of that tree naked with empty stomach, but in peace. Then he commanded me if I could run. Because he had a gun while I was waving that olive peace branches. When I was a teen ager my mother always used to say. ” Listen to the voices inside you. Does it come from your heart or from your head. Mr. Hassan Laab Salaax, how can one’s enemy be another’s Savior? Please elaborate how? Dear Laab – Salaax, in Somaliland today, people live for tomorrow. The present is a gift to the left – over of the old, deceased, late Vampire that were accepted with sorrow, like our own Minister of propaganda, Mr. Dust – Free. Who has given Yurub Geynyo the permission to participate in the inauguration of our Arch Enemy Mr. Farmaajo, who denies our existence as a Sovereign State. While imprisoning Mujahid Mohamed Bashe for expressing his political point of view. This personal hatred and slander of that dumb Minister of information won’t bring me down. My splattered blood already dried on the walls, over his newly innovated and decorated bedroom , for decades.. Where my head once collided , after my back soaked, bruised, and punched with his time Clock. Laab – Salaax, you and your band already has given Somalilanders and Somaliland An Oath Of Allah that you and your heart will be mine and mine for ever. You already had pleaded guilty of high – treason and betrayal to your Motherland by being an intimate friend to it’s enemy. You and your friends has proved guilty of consciousness and soul and that you are a body with two Souls. A poet must act as a mirror that reflects the emotions and true feelings of his country masses.
You are supposed to relay their sincere message to any dumb dictator or their enemy. You are expected to wear the same night – vision – goggles and magnifier of the masses. Follow the trails and tracks of their foot – print; not to impose your personal interest and regards to those poor masses that you represent as their mirror and Ambassador. You has acted as a gold digger and a Diva that admires gold and money. Mr. Laab Salaax, you are the cart, and the masses are the horse. Don’t put the cart before the horse. Remember, you can take a horse to a water but you can’t make him drink. We want a poet who can hear my cracked lungs and blew my thoughts aloud, in between here and there. I believe much that the World has less to do with beauty, and more to do with words. When we left unspoken, we become phantom mannequins. Hunted not by what we said in a moment of passion, but by what we didn’t say in a moment of hushed silence. The word bites harder and barks louder. The word is not admitted for her fluff, but for her honesty. As a poet, you are there for those silenced daily by that tyrant dictator and king, less they be forgotten. The bitch can stand alone while the Alpha Wolf like Mr. Silanyo, still needs his pack to lick his paws. Mr. Hassan, it is beautiful when you speak for those who have lost their voices like the Somalilanders. Poems are inspirational volumes that speaks for a deserted nation, like we do. Stimulates a person’s, or a society’s principal, faith, and career. A drawings in, of a breath of freedom, and super natural force of stimulation and boost. We want you to be where your audience want you to be. It is the gasps between the breathless laughter, or the anticipation before the firework.
Dear reader, recognizing the contributions of our heroes are still a mystery. That is why they are pushing and dragging their feet on fire, on through the dirt , on through the heat; and we are ignoring their alarming sound, while they are asking for attention. Asking we, we to borrow them our ears. Mr. Silanyo, who gave you the right to tell us that our Heroes can’t marry that beautiful and virgin girl. It is not easy; are you being a man when that vampire calls you a boy? It is not easy being a handsome, when the ugly keeps you down.. Mr. Laab – Salaax, pardon me if you catch me sometimes ripping off the wings of the butterflies. I am a peaceful dove and beautiful peacock with eyes wet with honest sweat. But now I am acting like a mad dog because I feel mad and upset, and morally down. I do not want you to go anywhere you find love and flower. I want you to be mine and mine forever.
Read my lips and my heart; and go and revise my biography and personal history as a Somalilander. I am allergic to blackmailing and conditional love of any sort. I want you to be, only where I want you to be. That is why you see me mad at you. The silence before a victory in equality, parallels the silence after. It is lighted by those who barter their carved flesh. Marriage is a love regardless of external force. A highly respected bond between two persons. Strength is a father’s peace, and struggle is a father’s fight. In history you have to read my heroes torture and pain. Because you are green man who had born yesterday. That is why you never understand, why we couldn’t be friends. Even though Hitler is dead, yet segregation and subordination is not over. That is what Martin, Rosa, and Malcolm X said in briefing. Ripping off all our rights and taking us as slaves that are held with shackles and handcuffs. The cracking sounds of the raped mothers with tears trembling, and running down their cheeks are still fixed in our memory.
Their husbands were slain and slashes whipped with chains and broken bones. The blood is not dry yet and the bruises are not healed. Above that, the feelings of being unnoticed and forgotten. My perfect shade is the one that the dumb Sheriff stands under.

By Darlene Donloe
The first ever Emmy Awards Diversity Celebration was held recently in the Leonard H. Goldenson Theatre Plaza at the TV Academy in North Hollywood to honor some of the industry’s elite artists.
Honorees included: Kerry Washington (Scandal), Don Cheadle (House of Lies), Alfre Woodard (Steel Magnolias), Louis C.K. (Louie), Sofia Vergara (Modern Family), Morena Baccarin (Homeland) and Bobby Cannavale (Boardwalk Empire).
Sharon Liggins, part of the event planning committee and a Governor for the Public Relations Peer Group, said the event "is a tribute to the diverse performers nominated this year, an acknowledgement of past winners and nominees and looking to future successes."
The airline-themed pre-Emmy reception, hosted by the television academy and the SAG-AFTRA actors union, was decked out in vintage decor. The wait staff was dressed in pilot and stewardess attire circa 1960.

On hand for the event, Washington, who is up for the outstanding lead actress in a drama series trophy for Scandal at Sunday's ceremony, is the first black actress in nearly two decades to be nominated in the category since Cicely Tyson’s nod in 1995’s Sweet Justice. Washington, 36, who was recently named the World’s Most Stylish Woman by People magazine and also topped Vanity Fair magazine annual best-dressed list, was dressed in a multi-tiered and ruffled pink dress with white pumps.
JOE MORTON
Washington was joined by her Scandal co-stars Joe Morton and Dan Bucatinsky, who received a nod for outstanding guest actor in a drama Emmy at the Creative Arts Emmys.
Jason George, who stars in Grey’s Anatomy and Mistresses and is also the chair of SAG-AFTRA’s diversity advisory committee, said of the nominees, "They are the aspiration for all actors who work in this medium, but tonight we're shining a light on the diverse aspects of that."
Others in attendance included Ron Glass, Chris Williams, Sharon Lawrence, Wilson Cruz and Lisa Vidal.
The 65th Primetime Emmy Awards will air live tonight (Sept 22) from the Nokia Theatre with Neil Patrick Harris serving as host.Use a Word and Make it Yours
or
Fart Jokes ALWAYS Help You Retain New Words.
Today, we are going to use common "doctor dialect" and translate it and use our new words in our every day speech. To "own" a new word, you need to use it in a sentence.
I tried dictating this post but my word recognition software made quite a mess of it. I suspect that the garbled language my dictation software misunderstood, is what my patients hear too.
The suffix for inflammation is "-itis."
rhino means nose. I always liked that one because it was pretty obvious. A rhinocerous has a big
nose.
"Rhinitis" equals inflammation of the nose.
"Allergic rhinitis" is an allergy that make your nose swell up or itch.
A "Diverticulum" is a finger like outpouching of the colon. Diverticulitis is an inflammation or infection of a diverticulum.
The Abdomen is the entire belly area.
But, we don't say "abdominitis". Instead, we use the name of the organ that is inflamed. For example, the lining of the abdominal cavity is called the Peritoneum, so:
peritonitis=inflammation of the lining of the abdomen
AND:
appendicitis=inflammation of the appendix
hepatitis=inflammation of the liver
Okay. So this is pretty dry, right?
Let's spice it up a little.
When you get a scab we call it an "eschar". What's underneath it, the little divet in the skin is called an "ulcer" or "ulceration".
If we follow through on this we could call potholes "asphalt ulcers."
(Doesn't that sound scientific?)
Here in Chicago when the roads are very potholed and there are hubcaps flying all over, we call it
"winter".
BUT we COULD call the potholed nightmares that pass for roadways in Chicago "diseased".
They have
ULCERATIVE ASPHALTITIS.
Tailgating annoys me no end because it's rude, annoying, and extremely dangerous. I think we should rename it: "RECTUM RIDING."
Some people have poo for brains. How did it get there, you might ask?
Well, those people must have a conduit to get poo from their colon to their brain (cerebral cortex). I say that those people have a colo-cerebral shunt.
Okay, here's a fun one for those of us who are still amused by farts. (And really, who isn't deep down?)
The technical term for passing gas is "flatus" or "flatulence".
Urinating is "micturating".
Having a bowel movement or pooping is "defecating".
(Most people know that one.)
SO, someone who is a gasbag or talks too much has flatulence breath.
Logos means "words". And we all know "diarrhea" is running at the bowels. Put the two together and you get logorrhea--Someone verbose or who is very talkative.
Belching or burping in "doctor" is "ERUCTION"
.
I like using the word "ERUCTION" in public because it always gets confused with other words-- you know, like "ELECTION".
(What? Seriously? Are your minds in the gutter AGAIN?)
So, Let's use our new words in a sentence or two. Here's a little scenario/story using many of our new words.
That guy driving behind us has a colo-cerebral shunt! Did you see how he was rectum riding me? Then we hit that patch of asphalt ulcers and one of his tires blew out.
He pulled over, got out of his car, and lit up a cigarette. He walked around his car checking his tires, but when he bent over, there was a simultaneously huge eruction and loud passing of flatus.
(I almost micturated in my pants laughing.)
Well, who knows what he was eating earlier. It must have been something good because those bodily vapors went shooting up in flames towards the heavens, lit by a spark from his cigarette.
He started swearing like a sailor as the police pulled over. They took one look at his rhinophyma and figured that he was an alcoholic (although that's not really true).
They made him do the breathalyzer test.
Suddenly he doubled over in pain, holding his abdomen. The police called for an ambulance and we later found out he'd had emergency surgery for appendicitis.
So, the moral of the story is:
Don't tail gate, don't smoke, and don't drink or you'll end up with a big nose, horrible gas and a flat tire.
The End
SEE HOW MUCH YOU LEARNED?
Colo-cerebral shunt is my new favorite!
It's one of mine, too. Bathroom humor is universal.
Another one for my list of awesome homophones? aphthous ulcers/ asphalt ulcers
So close.
You've outdone yourself - AGAIN.
Consider yourself bookmarked.
Thank you! Always grateful for new and return readers!Artisan Boilermaker Jobs

We recently purchased a convection oven and have just started to use that feature instead of standard baking. We were aware that the convection process cooks the food faster but we did not know how to adjust the time accordingly. Of course we did not consult the owner’s manual which probably has many useful tips. Instead, we decided to “wing it” and keep our eye on the food and call it done with a visual inspection of the food product. What we found through a few trial and error attempts was that the food cooked was ready about 20% sooner while using the same temperature. Our 2 trial and error attempts were a rising crust frozen pizza (Supreme) and frozen French fries. While doing a little research on the topic for this blog, I learned via the internet that many times the cooking temperature can also be reduced in addition to the time.
An 8 pound bone-in turkey breast usually takes about 2 hours and 15 minutes at 350 in a conventional oven but only 1 hour 41 minutes at 330 degrees with a convection unit. How do I know that you may ask? Well, this is where the power of the internet kicks in. I simply googled “convection oven cooking times” and the web site below was listed – try it out for yourself :
Not only am I saving energy in two ways by having shorter cook times and lower temperatures, I am saving on my electric bill and most important of all delivering the fresh, steaming hot pizza to my pie-hole six minutes faster. I may actually use the extra six minutes saved in cooking time to get out the owner’s manual and read up on the manufacturer’s suggestion on the proper use of this thing.
If you want to see a more dramatic result, consider the recommendations found in the box of Reynolds Oven Bags for beef brisket. Using their bags for an 8 pound brisket they recommend 325 degrees for 3 hours and 15 minutes. Using the convection converter on the web site above they recommend 305 degrees for 2 hours and 26 minutes. That is almost an hour faster – color me impressed. Of course if you were a barbecue aficionado you would cook it at 170 degrees for 16 hours over an open fire.
Have a savory week.Getting Started
Welcome to this starter guide to editing content on SFF Wiki!
blah, blah, blah, intro here
SFF Wiki is using the DokuWiki software so please refer to their documentation if you're not sure how to do something:
Also check the syntax page: Formatting Syntax
Creating new pages
To create new entries, easiest way to start is to type in the URL it should have. The convention is category/category/manufacturer-model###, with dashes in place of spaces.
For example:
After going to the soon-to-be page, click the little pencil on the right-hand side to add content. When done, click Save to save the new content and the page will be created.
Creating new categories
Creating new categories (called namespaces in DokuWiki) is very similar to creating new pages. The only difference is the address, which will be category/newcategory/intro.
For example:
The intro part is important, intro pages are special pages that serve as the homepage for the category.
Infobox
For products, there are templates to use for the infobox, example here: FSP FSP400-60FGGBA
For PSUs the template is power supplies but the others will need work.PRESS RELEASE
As part of the nationwide TAX MARCH, there will be a BRATTLEBORO TAX MARCH on April, 15th, 2017.
The Brattleboro Tax March begins at the Whetstone Walkway (the wide brick sidewalk that runs alongside the Coop parking lot).
The purpose of the march is to call on President Donald Trump to release his tax returns. Without his returns, Americans are in the dark about Trump's conflicts of interest, his foreign entanglements, and whether he even pays any taxes at all. The Brattleboro Tax March will travel through downtown Brattleboro (up the sidewalks to the library and then across the street and back down the sidewalks on the other side of the street). The Brattleboro TAX MARCH will end at the with at Plaza Park (the triangular shaped park at the base on Holstein Place) with a speech by Patti Whalen, the former international judge, specializing in war crimes.
The Brattleboro Tax March is sponsored by: Women Marching Forward, The Action Pod, The Putney Huddle, and The Family Solidarity Action NetworkWhen I used to listen to the Dead Kennedys in high school, we scrawled their logo on our jackets, notebooks, pee-chees and bathroom walls. The familiar DK symbol meant you were different, you stood out, you were punk rock. Most of us had no idea what being punk rock really meant, but it sounded cool and many years later I saw it in action when The Dead Kennedys played the Hard Rock Cafe. Klaus and East Bay Ray are still around, so is former DK drummer DH Peligro and new frontman Skip wasn’t Jello Biafra, but he certainly didn’t disappoint. They were loud and they kicked ass. Nothing says love like a huge mosh pit full of happy kids slam dancing.LAKE GEORGE - Regional conservation officials and Lake George Village Mayor Robert Blais has invited the public to the upcoming annual Water Quality Protection and Resource Conservation Forum set for Tuesday, Oct. 13 at the Fort William Henry Conference Center.

Free Tibet Campaign was overwhelmed by the number of protesters who turned out from all over the UK and Europe. It was a fantastic day of peaceful protests as we made our voices heard all along the route from Wembley to the O2 Arena in Greenwich. There's hardly a shot of the London Olympic Torch Relay that doesn't have a Tibetan flag in the background!
As the torch continues on to Paris and San Francisco, the protests have followed, turning China's propaganda of a "Journey of Harmony" into a PR nightmare. Meanwhile questions are being asked both in London and Paris about the role of the Chinese security guards surrounding the torch, described by Lord Coe as "thugs". Australian authorities have already refused to allow them to participate in the Canberra leg of the torch relay.
Even IOC President Jacques Rogge has finally been forced to state "The International Olympic Committee has expressed its serious concern and called for a rapid, peaceful resolution of Tibet".
Unfortunately people in China will not being seeing the full scale of the protests in London and Paris which Chinese officials have condemned as "vile behaviour" from "a tiny number of Tibet independence elements". Official estimates of that "tiny number" are over 3000 people!
You can see a round-up of events from the day in the photos and videos below including the wonderful Tibetan Torch rally at Argyle Square. Our sincere thanks to Joanna Lumley and to all those who took part in this event.

3.5/5
This book is the second in a series and picks up right where the first one left off. Alecia was being attacked by Jake and Allan saves her. But even though he loves her there is a lot of darkness in him he doesn't know how to deal with. He is having a hard time being there for her. With everything gong on, Alecia starts to get sick and Lance shows up. He is becoming the man she needs.
It was a very emotional story. Alecia is such a strong woman even with everything she has gone through. A definite read but make sure you read book 1 first!
Anguish,
Sorrow,

Three things buried deep down inside of me and I couldn’t rid my soul of them.
My torso was draped over the padded leather arm of the sofa, engulfed in the middle of my living room; lifeless and still. I had no desire to move and the successful drive I once had was gone. Solitary confinement in my own apartment was the only place I felt safe anymore.
Jake had stolen everything from me so what was there to do now? My pride-gone, my determination-gone, my will to live-gone, so what was next? What was the purpose of my being?

6.3 “You are the earth’s preserving salt,1 if the salt loses taste, how will it regain saltiness? Such salt is good only for disposal and for stepping on. You are the world’s light. A hilltop city cannot be hidden. Neither is already lit candle2 hidden under a bowl. It is placed on a holder to give its light to those in the house. Let your light so shine for all to see your good works, and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.”
Mar 11 .”
6.4 “You have heard for ages, ‘Do not kill, or you will be judged.’ But I say, whoever is angry with his brother must stand trial; and whoever calls his brother a fool must face the court, or whoever says, ‘You idiot,’ is in danger of hell fire.
Mar 12 Therefore, if while bringing your gift to the altar you remember that a brother has something against you, first go and make peace with your brother. Then return and offer your gift. Settle1 quickly with your opponent out of court, lest the judge convicts you to imprisonment until you’ve paid the last coin.”
“You have heard it said, ‘Do not commit adultery.’ But I say, whoever looks at a woman lustfully, commits adultery in his heart. If your right eye lures you to sin, pluck and cast it out. Better one part perishes than the entire body be cast into hell. If your right hand causes you to sin, cut and throw it away. Better lose a hand than your entire body going into hell.”
Mar 13 “It was also said, ‘Whoever divorces his wife should give her a letter of divorce.’ But I say, whoever divorces his wife except for fornication makes her an adulteress, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery. And a woman divorcing her husband and marrying another commits adultery.”
“Again you’ve heard it said to the ancients, ‘You shall not break oaths, but keep your oaths to the Lord’. But I say, don’t swear at all: either by heaven, it is God’s throne, or by earth, it is His footstool, nor by Jerusalem, it is the great King’s city. Neither swear by your head, you cannot make one hair2 white or black. Let your answers be ‘Yes’ or ‘No.’ Anything more is of evil.”
Mar 14 “You have heard it said, ‘Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth.’ But I say, do not resist evil. To anyone who hits you on the right cheek, turn the other. And to anyone suing for your shirt, give also your coat. Should someone co-opt you for a mile, go two. Give to whoever asks you, and do not refuse the borrower.” “You have heard it said, ‘Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’ But I say, love your enemies and pray for your persecutors, so you will be sons of your heavenly Father, who makes the sun to rise on the evil and the good, and the rain to fall on the just and the unjust.

Benefits of Oregano
1. The health benefits of oregano
Oregano is an important culinary and medicinal herb that has been used in medicine and cooking for thousands of years with a number of potential health benefits. It is a species of Origanum, belonging to the mint family
2. Antibacterial properties
Oregano oil is a powerful antimicrobial, because it contains an essential compound called carvacol.Oregano has shown antimicrobial activity in a number of studies. A group of Portuguese researchers found that Origanum vulgare essential oils were effective against 41 strains of the food pathogen Listeria monocytogenes2.
3. Side effects and precautions
Eating oregano can cause stomach upsets in some people. In addition, those who are allergic to plants belonging to the Lamiaceae family (such as including basil, lavender, mint, and sage) should be cautious, as they may also develop an allergic reaction to oregano.
4..
5. Vitamin Boost
Oregano is a rich natural source of vitamin K, an important vitamin that is often overlooked. Learn more about vitamin K.
6. Antibacterial Punch
Oregano oil in many specialty and health food shops for this very reason. Oregano contains thymol and carvacrol, two oils which have remarkable bacteria fighting power. In fact, researchers recently discovered that oregano is a better treatment for giardia than the prescription drug commonly prescribed to treat the illness.
7. Minerals
Oregano is high in iron, manganese, and other important minerals for health. Its one of the healthiest and tastiest herbs you can try, so if you havent stopped reading yet to run out and buy some, scoot!
8. Fiber Full
Oregano is rich in fiber (the amount is similar to chicory). Fiber is necessary to provide bulk for better elimination. As Mark always says,fiber is king!
9. Go fresh
When buying oregano, its best to purchase fresh leaves instead of the dried variety. Yes, a little shakity shake is easier and more convenient, but you also miss out on those beneficial anti bacterial and anti oxidant oils. Fresh oregano is pretty inexpensive. In fact, its very easy to grow yourself!
10. Perfume
Oregano makes a lovely scent for your skin similar to patchouli. It is guaranteed to drive the ladies wild, gentlemen. Because it is a commonly used ingredient in pizzas and spaghetti, dont be surprised if people, especially former carb addicts, bite you.

That little something that you cant just buy at any old corner store. Right now I have been working with them to find some unique window treatments and one of the thoughts that came to mind was; make my own. Spoonflower is based in our own beloved Durham, NC.

But, here it is, a shiny new snippet from the short story I'm writing for the SFR Brigade anthology! Meet Commander Kaleb Hath and the rift rat/pirate/former POW Lana...
People began shuffling in. They walked past her whispering. “Iloni” was a favorite word. “Not Daniels” was common. “Mercenary” was another favorite. The accents were from all over the outer rim of the solar system, she even caught a few phrases delivered in rift rat cant. And through it all she could feel Kaleb watching her.
His stare heated the back of her neck. Lana rubbed it, and flipped him an obscene gesture. Her reward was a soft baritone chuckle.
Three years ago it would have led to him coming over to whisper in her ear. Whispers would have turned to flirting, flirting to kissing, and she would have woken up the next morning naked in his arms.
Lana glanced at the dark monitor beside her, Kaleb’s reflection still watched her, his dark eyes filled with dangerous combination of desire, regret, and loss.One of my favorite times of the year because September means that fall is right around the corner! I just love love the cooler months for so many reasons. Oklahoma isn't the most autumn-friendly place--we pretty much go from disgusting heat to cold in a matter of a few weeks. The window for perfect temperatures doesn't last long so I look forward to it more and more every year!
I am glad my month of extra shifts is over for now. I got lots of extra money to stash away into savings. Our beach vacations is LESS than three weeks away and we are very excited. I am glad that Hurricane Isaac decided to spare the Pensacola area from its wrath.
Last week several friends at work put in orders for different variations of an embroidered wall plaque that I do---22 all together! Here are a few of them...
The good news is that I got them all done. The bad news is that within a couple of hours of completing them the card reader for my embroidery machine fried. Nick tried taking it apart and bypassing the bad circuitry but it would immediately mess up when I plugged it back in. Thankfully my machine is ok, it is just the card reader/memory card I have to replace.
Over the last few months I have been gathering different cute robot fabrics for Brad's room redo. I believe I have all that I need for the little custom touches that I want to put in it. I am making his pillowcase, sheet, comforter, lampshade, and wall decorations. It has been safari animals since his birth so I thought his transition from crib to toddler bed would be a good time to update the decor! I know he will love it.
We are excited for this weekend because our county fair is going on! We will be spending Saturday there riding the rides and eating the yummy food. As Brad gets older it is so fun to see his excitement.
Show some love and tell me what you think! Don't forget to check back often for new posts.The InterPlay Malawi Connection.

Back Owed Taxes
Back Taxes are State or Federal tax obligations that are outstanding from previous tax durations. These taxes generally result in some kind of penalties or rate of interest due to the fact that they are overdue, as well as will continuously accumulate until they are paid. In the interest of avoiding liens or compelled collection activities taken versus you by tax obligation agencies, it is extremely recommended that back taxes are handled as quickly as possible.
Back taxes go overdue for a range of reasons. Misinformed taxpayers could be not aware that they owe tax obligations or that they owe greater than exactly what they paid. Some overlook to file the appropriate forms, while others knowingly prevent paying tax obligations and submit no forms in all. Back taxes apply to both {organisations and also individuals tax deductions
Revealing initiative to repay taxes is the advised strategy, rather than awaiting tax obligation firms ahead to you for repayment. The I.R.S. even provides amnesty to taxpayers to demonstrate intent to settle their back tax obligations, using aid as well as layaway plan alternatives to those that need them. Nevertheless, without your cooperation, tax obligation firms will take aggressive actions.
The very first step in settling back taxes is by submitting the suitable forms for every single overdue tax obligation year in. This will help figure out just how much cash is owed, if in all. Often, taxpayers discover that the government really owes them cash; by not submitting returns, some taxpayers could wind up overpaying and are eligible for refunds. Much more included back tax obligations might require the help of tax obligation specialists that are well acquainted with tax obligation regulations and also are qualified to negotiate with firms on your behalf.
A payment plan is the most effective alternative if you are unable to pay back taxes. By figuring out an amount to supply as settlement that fits your budget plan, you could prevent severe lawful consequences. It is very important to recognize, nonetheless, that tax agencies could take a range of actions to accumulate the funds owed, consisting of building confiscation, placement of liens as well as a levy on economic accounts.
IRS Audit
When the I.R.S. investigates the information of your tax obligation return to establish if it is exact, an I.R.S. Audit is. The probabilities that the I.R.S. will select your tax return for audit is relatively low; normally, no more than 2% of individual income taxes are examined, about 1 in every 75. {Nevertheless, bout 80% of all people will certainly be audited a minimum of when throughout their period as an employee.
An I.R.S. audit in Texas is normally reserved for tax obligation returns with “high audit possibility”, or returns that will most likely include a considerable shortage in repayment. Particular kinds of earnings, revenue degrees, professions, deal histories and also reductions asserted on tax obligation returns often tend to bring in more focus. The system is orchestrated by the I.R.S. computer system, which ratings each tax obligation return with a number; the greater the number, the greater the probability it will certainly be investigated.
If you occur to drop in this classification and are hit with an I.R.S. Audit in Texas, it should not be shrugged off; as soon as you have the I.R.S.’s focus, they will certainly most likely extend their investigation past the previous tax obligation year to tax obligation returns and also deductions made in years prior to. From there, they will certainly make a decision if you owe added tax obligations. Many taxpayers are not able to provide all the paperwork required, which is one of the primary reasons why the I.R.S. wins 80% of audits.
In an uncommon circumstances, the I.R.S. will discover that you overpaid your taxes which you are owed a reimbursement.
There are three kinds of audits, depending on the quantity of cash reported on the return. All documentation exchanges to sustain the precision of your tax obligation return are sent by message; in these instances, the I.R.S. generally desires to get information about genuine estate transactions, supply deals and also certain itemized reductions.
The following kind of Audit is an “Office Audit”, when the taxpayer satisfies face-to-face with the I.R.S. and brings them documents that the I.R.S. requests. In these cases, it is extremely recommended that the taxpayer recruit the help of a tax professional with proficiency in audit processes. Their suggestions will assist you in offering suitable details and also sustaining your debate. The last is a “Area or House Audit”, when the I.R.S. sees you at your residence or organisation for an audit. These are one of the most extreme audits, and also once more, are best handled making use of a tax professional’s aid.
A Texas I.R.S. audit is a highly entailed procedure that is not basic to browse alone. Tax specialists recognize how you can locate information that will sustain your instance that you might unknown around, which will significantly boost your chances of a far better result. Like in a chess suit, experienced gamers are the ones with the best strategy as well as understand their opponents’ following move.
Tax Liens
Taxpayers with overdue back taxes that have actually prevented settling their debt with I.R.S. are prime targets for a Tax Lien. The term “Tax Lien” describes the I.R.S.’s legal claim on a taxpayer’s residential or commercial property as payment for their debt, and also it is among the very first aggressive actions the I.R.S. requires to accumulate on back taxes after previous contact has actually been disregarded. It will certainly then turn into a Tax obligation Levy if a Tax Lien is likewise ignored.
CP-504, cp-502 and cp-503
a watercraft, automobile or house
If you continue to overlook a Tax Lien, the I.R.S. eventually seize your assets and also market them, likewise recognizes as a Tax Levy. By the time your tax obligation situation comes to this, the I.R.S. has little belief in your ability to settle your back tax obligations.
If there is a Tax Lien on your house, speaking with a tax professional for assistance is highly suggested.Today I am writing about one of my favorite shows at Fashion Week, which was the one from Burberry Prorsum.
Designer Christopher Bailey presented a mix from oversized pieces with floral prints and laces in dark and light colors for H/W 14.
My favorite was Cara Delivingne. She just looked stunning in a big coat, which actually looks like a huge scarf. A dream of dark red and brown.
The part of the show, which I liked the most was, when the models walked on the catwalk with umbrellas, while it was snowing! Amazing show.
I show you here my favorite Outfits and moments of the show.Sow in snow?
With the country turning white with snow and ice there can be no doubt that Autumn has turned to winter. Nonetheless a significant number of people are contacting us to ask if it is still OK to sow wild flower seeds!
For a few species like yellow rattle that need pre-chilling before they grow the answer is YES.
For yellow rattle it would be quite in order to scatter its seeds now onto snow.
You will at least be able to easily see where you have sown and the seeds will reach the soil when the snow melts.
In our experience provided you sow Yellow rattle seed before Christmas it will germinate successfully in the following spring.
For most seed however sowing seeds at this time of year is a gamble. Winter sowings can work, but if the soil becomes both waterlogged and cold then failures are likely.
If in doubt store your seed safely in a cool dry location and wait until spring.

We present a cheap multilevel solver for partition of unity discretizations of any order. The shape functions of a PUM are products of piecewise rational partition of unity (PU) functions and higher order local approximation functions (usually a local polynomial. Furthermore, they are non-interpolatory. In a multilevel approach we not only have to cope with non-interpolatory basis functions but also with a sequence of nonnested spaces due to the meshfree construction. Hence, injection or interpolatory interlevel transfer operators are not available for our multilevel PUM. Therefore, the remaining natural choice for the prolongation operators are L2-projections. Here, we exploit the partition of unity construction of the function spaces and a hierarchical construction of the PU itself to localize the corresponding projection problem. This significantly reduces the computational costs associated with the setup and the application of the interlevel transfer operators. The second main ingredient for our multilevel solver is the use of a block-smoother to treat the local approximation functions simultaneously. The results of our numerical experiments in two and three dimensions show that the convergence rate of the proposed multilevel solver is independent of the number of patches. The convergence rate is slightly dependent on the local approximation orders.} }Customer Reviews - Go to Contact Us
MOLD INSPECTION & LAB TESTS in San Diego, California
Serving San Diego County for mold inspections and mold testing, Tenants’ rights/Landlord rights, and Code Enforcement letters. Certified Mold hygienist and Certified Advanced Mold Inspector.
CONSUMER ALERT!
Beware of Mold Inspection Companies that also do Mold Remediation Repairs. Their testing is designed to offer a Free Inspection, but drive up the cost through Mold Remediation. Ask questions, remember nothing is FREE! Use an unbiased Certified Mold Inspector.
Hi, I'm William O'Gorman, Owner of Mold Inspections and Lab Tests in San Diego, Calif. When someone calls me they think that they may have a unique mold problem and they don't know where to start. The first thing is we have to determine if you do indeed have a mold problem or water damage problem and then we can start from there.
- Tenants’ Rights - There is help. A new law went into effect in 2016 that helps protect a tenant from a landlord who is unresponsive or does shoddy work on a potential mold or water intrusion problem. The Code Enforcement Department in your city is mandated that when they receive a complaint from a tenant, they will send a Code Enforcement Officer to their home to evaluate and document their complaints. If the Code Enforcement Officer believes their complaints have merit, the next step is that a letter of a Code Compliance will be sent to their landlord, giving the landlord 30 days to address all of the complaints or they will face a fine of $1,000 to $,2500 a day for each day past 30 days. There are no fees for this service.
- Landlord Rights - You have the right, within 30 days from the date of the letter, to address the complaints and have them certified. There is help. I know what Code Enforcement needs to close their file. I have helped landlords through this process. Please call and have your Code Enforcement letter in hand.
- Home sellers - Doing a pre-sale home mold inspection would be a wise idea. When it comes to detected mold and water problems, it generally happens near the end of the escrow and there may not be enough time to correct the problem. The deal may fall apart and then you still have to fix the problem for the next buyer, and who knows when they may come along? It's good insurance to have a pre-sale mold inspection.
- Home Buyers - You only have one shot to find out potential problems while you are in escrow. When I walk into a home for the inspection, I have the attitude that someone is hiding something from my customer. I have thousands of mold inspections under my belt, and I have made my customers thousands of dollars. If you are buying a bank-owned house, you have to remember that the bank has nothing to disclose and also the previous owner had no money to fix any mold or water problems. I have a nice system for this and with the proper documentation in your hands, we can get all of these problems fixed or the costs deducted from the sale. Don't be fooled when the bank says, "It's an as-is sale." It's an as-is sale when they have the money in their hands. If your deal falls through for any reason, then the bank has documentation that they have to disclose to the next buyer that may be a year down the road. My system works. That's why I am used by hundreds of realtors in San Diego County.
- Realtors - What I know about this mold business is that I would not buy a shack in this state without the proper inspections. The buyer is relying on you to guide them through the biggest purchase of their life. When a buyer moves into their new home and they start finding major problems that could have been detected by proper inspections, the first person they want to sue is the realtor. You want to do the right thing for your customer and you. Our lab report documentation will help protect you at the close of escrow.
- Homeowners - If you or a family member has health concerns, mold spores may be the problem. There are many conditions associated with mold. We have to determine what types of mold we are dealing with, and you may have to go to a doctor who specializes in mold. A home inspection and air quality test may help you identify the problem or eliminate it. I have taken over 25,000 lab samples and completed over 7,500 home inspections, so you know you are in good hands.
- Prices - I purchase, in advance, 1,000 prepaid lab tests and by doing this, I receive a big discount and I pass these savings on to my customers. In some cases, we may need more than two tests. I would rather you over-test than under-test. I do not make extra money on the extra test. Home inspection and two free lab tests are $239. Any additional tests if we need them are $25 extra per test.

Unless we are sorely mistaken, one area of expenditure that will not be subject to cuts in the spending review will be drug law enforcement.
This is despite the fact that by anyone’s reckoning, supply side prohibition is high cost/low benefit. However, normal auditing procedures do not apply to a policy area that is predicated primarily upon populist grandstanding.
See full special report on social work and drug misuse
The accounting process that ministers use for applying evidence-based reform in this policy area, is not based on value for money, but on balancing political expediency with expenditure of political capital.
Research has shown that every pound spent on policing the drug laws results in further reactive costs of dealing with the unintended consequences of criminalisation.
The current policy, with its heady mix of expenditure on enforcement and treatment is creaking at the seams.
The fact is that the drug treatment industry is a major beneficiary of the prohibition-based system.
Treatment provision amounts to almost £1bn a year, as the government attempts to reduce drug-related offending among the 300,000 problem users of heroin and crack.
Alcohol treatment receives far less to treat an estimated two to three million chronic drinkers. Why? Because alcoholics don’t steal.
So, a prohibition-based system will persist through one of the toughest CSRs ever. It will continue to push problematic users toward committing acquisitive crime to support their habits and then use the criminal justice system to reduce their offending.
And we, the taxpayers, will continue to foot the bill for this perverse regime.
However, the economic crisis is not going to end anytime soon and, with two Latin American presidents calling for a debate on legal regulation and the polls moving inexorably toward legal regulation, it is difficult to see how prohibition can survive two more reviews.

Steven Seitz’s work in teleportation and virtual reality is giving people the ability to feel like they are somewhere they are not; essentially, transporting them to a physical experience with VR technology, novel camera technologies and Google’s powerful data centers and algorithms. Seitz, professor of computer science at University of Washington at Seattle (UW), also leads the teleportation group at Google.
Seitz is part of a new class of recently announced ACM fellows, 54 members in total, whose expansive expertise in computer vision and computer graphics has made a significant impact globally and in the way we live and work in our everyday lives. These new ACM fellows join an elite group of researchers and academicians that represent less than one percent of ACM’s overall membership.
“I was floored that many of the colleagues I most admire would take the time and effort to nominate me for this honor,” says Seitz.
The 2017 fellows have been cited for numerous contributions in areas including artificial intelligence, big data, computer architecture, computer graphics, high performance computing, human-computer interaction, sensor networks, and wireless networking. ACM will formally recognize Seitz as a new ACM fellow at its annual awards banquet, to be held in San Francisco on June 23, 2018.
Seitz, who began working with Google in 2010, has spent his career focusing on problems in computer graphics and computer vision. His research aims to capture the structure, appearance, and behavior of the real world in digital imagery, and more recently his attention has been spent making advances in virtual reality, augmented realty, and teleportation.
“We are focused on inventing ways to capture and transmit the world’s places, people, and events,” he notes of his work at UW. “Imagine watching an NBA game projected holographically onto your table top or communicating with remote family, friends, and colleagues as if you were physically all together, or even preserving your life’s important moments in a way that you can literally step back into them later.”
To explore these possibilities and other research problems in VR and AR, Seitz and UW colleagues Ira Kemelmacher-Shlizerman and Brian Curless have launched a new interdisciplinary center at UW. The UW Reality Lab, unveiled on Jan. 8, is being funded by Facebook, Oculus, Google and Huawei, and aims to advance the state of the art in virtual and augmented reality by developing new technologies and applications, educating the next generation of researchers and technologists, and supporting robust collaborations with industry.
After receiving his B.A. in computer science and mathematics at UC Berkeley and Ph.D. in computer science at University of Wisconsin at Madison, Seitz conducted research at Microsoft, working in the tech giant’s Vision Technology Group and Interactive Visual Media Group. His work with collaborators Noah Snavely and Rick Szeliski formed the basis of Microsoft’s Photosynth, one of the early photography apps that enabled users to create realistic 3-D views of objects and locations through their still photos. Prior to joining the faculty at UW in 2000, Seitz was an assistant professor and later an adjunct assistant professor at the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University.
For Seitz, the old adage, “right place, right time,” so to speak, plays a key role in how the next big research idea materializes.
“I’m a big fan of timing, where suddenly, due to one breakthrough, another becomes possible,” he adds. “A good example,” he explains, “is Photo Tourism, a project that would not have been possible even six months prior. It built on two new breakthroughs that had just arrived at the same time—Internet photo sharing, as in Flickr, and [Google research scientist] David Lowe’s SIFT work. This kind of serendipitous timing motivates many of my projects at UW and Google.”
At Google, Seitz has been involved in developing the imagery experience in recent versions of Google Maps. He has enjoyed seeing his work roll out now in several VR technologies, including Google Jump, Cardboard Camera, and VR mode in YouTube.Just a quick message to all those wonderful Bloggers and followers who have asked about my stamp range.

I have called this card and post Twisted Lilac because I have used Sue's wonderful weaving dies however when framing the piece to make the card I have twisted the design so that the weave goes diagonally and not straight.
I stared by die cutting 2 each of the classic and striped weaving dies 2 classic in white and 2 striped in lilac foundation card. IO then wove them together using the small strips from the striped set stuck over the individual pieces form the classic die. This gives a different look and also allows you to make a different pattern. I have been playing with these dies and have found that by altering the colours you can make paper versions of different fabrics (i am working on a Tartan for reveal next week I hope!)
Next I added this frame of the woven pattern twisting the pattern so that I runs diagonally cutting off the excess around the edges. I then simply added a couple of mats and layers of the coconut white and lilac to frame this.
It make the sentiment panel I simply used the middle die from the pierced flags die set which doesn't have a cutting line of the straight edge and turned to die to cut a double ended flag. I added some of the new CE self adhesive pearl strips in white however i cut between the 2 lines on the strip and added one strip to each side. I then die cut the best wishes die in lilac card onto which I had added a piece of double sided adhesive sheet and sugared the finished cut with Iced snow. To finish the card I added a piece of the lilac embossed with the CE A4 embossing folder fine finials onto which I rubbed enchanted gold gilding wax. I then, as always, added a few layers of the same colours to frame the piece and finish the card.

Not bad, I like this artilce because it told me a lot.
With the current leadership on the way out, why does it not take the approach that it has ‘nothing to lose’ and therefore introduce the necessary policies to address the structural and systemic problems?
I suppose that whenever there is a change of leadership, there is always period of paralysis around that period. However, one suspects that the new leaders will also try to avoid any radical political change and hope to continue to ‘muddle through.
It’s true: no wonder the one originally from Shanghai was finally chosen as the top official in China in 1989 because he had culturally professionally, successfully, and shamelessly muddled everything into a state that others could not figure out who was who that any success made was therefore conclusively due to his leadership.
It’s very true, the sweeping dropping of bombs from high is the “iron birds laying eggs,” as the Chinese proverb, of old, says, as is the case in Libya; consequently, Kaddafi had more than “won first prize in the aviation lottery”, religio-philosophically speaking. Furthermore, should the inflation, “on a high level since the second half of 2010,” be turned into, to be such as the “bomb” … Oh, the Arabic Spring, come! I say and I pray. For I’ve been in the netherworld for too long.
PS: “Chapter 08”, unheard of! I’ve only heard of that he was sent therefore to a place “safer”, “On grounds of international security”.
That’s it! That’s due punishment of the obsessed; the theme of the towering work in literature, Crime and Punishment of Dostoevsky. But some of my Chinese acquaintances have often ignored what does the “due” mean: when they hear of someone being cursed for example they read it rather superstitiously: they are much unaware of that, the curse is a due: when one is evil for instance he is cursed at the same time!
I do not feel sure of that, “the current leadership’s on the way out”; I feel perhaps NOT! For I myself dare not ignore the power of the currents of the deep waters, the deeps of the bottomless pit!
A complement to Zhengxu’s blog might be to read the previous issue of The Economist, which had a special report on State Capitalism. As brought out in various articles of the special report, the problem of the triumphal adoption/adaptation of capitalism to powerful state interests in China, Russia and elsewhere is the question of governance, not simply of the huge state-owned firms, but of society more broadly. And this comes down to voice, or the lack of it. While party apparatchiks and acolytes pocket huge fortunes and monopolise power over resources, most citizens are disempowered and increasingly, I suspect, disenchanted with the conspicuous appropriation of wealth. China is more effective at squashing alternative voices than Russia and others, but that is not necessarily an inevitable or sustainable future.
I think it is because that it has too much to lose so it prefers to leave the burden to the next one inline…For the people in Edmonton, they don’t have to be worried about their dental sickness and problems at all.

I have them all over the house but hate having to throw out all of that wax! Don’t let the wax from your Scentsy bars go to waste when they loose their scent. Create a DIY Scentsy Candle with just a few supplies and easy steps. I love making beautiful projects with something that would have otherwise been discarded.
Originally shared on Capturing Joy.
Supplies:
Scentsy wax bars that have lost their fragrance
125ml mason jar
wooden dowel
6-8″ candle wick
tape
wick tab (optional)
fragrance oil (optional)
*you can find candle making supplies at Michaels.
Directions:
Cut the candle wick to match the height of the mason jar. Attach a wick tab to one end of the wick. Tape the other end of the wick to the center of the dowel. Place the dowel over the centre of the mason jar. When your Scentsy wax is ready to be discarded simply pour the melted wax into the mason jar. Before it cools add a drop of fragrance oil (optional). As you continue to fill the jar, layers of wax will build up to create a candle. It will take 2-3 Scentsy wax bars to fill a small sized mason jar. If you use your Scentsy warmers more often, consider choosing a larger mason jar to create a bigger candle.
This little mason jar candle took me about six months to fill as I only use my Scentsy warmers once a week or so. I kept the jar in the same place that I store my Scentsy bars for easy filling. I love how it turned out with the layers of colourful wax. And it actually smells great too! If you would like to add more scent to the candle you can purchase fragrance oils from Micheals. Add the oil to this DIY Scentsy Candle to give it more fragrance or extent the life of your Scentsy wax by adding a drop to the melted wax in your Scentsy warmer. As always be sure to use care when burning candles and use in a well ventilated area where they will not be left unattended.
Permanent companionsEdit

Temporary companionsEdit
The game has a number of temporary companions that will only be available during certain quests.

Companion affinity is gained and lost with two varying degrees for both. Here is how the table below represents those changes:
NotesEdit
- Unlike, assigning character. This one can be modified and equipped on Nick) or he can wear the High Confessor Tektus' robes from the Far Harbor add carry and X6-88 are the only companions who can be killed by the Sole Survivor if they're not following the Survivor.
- Perks gained from companions are permanent. This holds true regardless of the status of the companion (e.g. hostile towards the player character, dead, etc.).
- It is impossible to complete the main story of Fallout 4 and keep all companions (so if one wants to get all companion perks a few must be done before comepleting the main quest).
-. On contrast, agressive.
BugsEdit
- pc.
- pc.
- ps4 Ada may remain with you even though you have just selected dismiss in dialogue, as well as the option of settlement won't pop up. [verification overdue]
- One solution is to restart the game.
- Another solution is to acquire a different companion.
- ps4 When sending a companion to another settlement using the workshop he/ she will not go there straight away, and bringing the settlement choices back up will show the place still as an option to where they can be sent. [verification overdue]
- A fix for this is to turn the game off, then reloading the save.
- Another fix is to fast travel to a different place and sleep in a bed and return.tit licking nanatsu hentaifotos usun yoon desnuda

12 Good Golly Miss Molly<<I’m addicted to my slow cooker, its definitely my favourite kitchen gadget of the last month or so. All I have to do is chop some raw ingredients and it makes me look like a great cook. I’m not, but it allows me the indulgent self-delusion and that’s not to be sniffed at.
There are some surreal side effects though –
1. Following breakfast, you do all the preparation for your tea. This can leave you wondering when exactly in the day it is.
2. By the time its ready to eat you’ve kinda forgotten you had anything to do with it, because you go into the kitchen “to make tea” and all you have to do is dish it up. This makes you feel like someone else made it (always a good thing). It can also make you feel like you get your food from meals on wheels (not always a good thing).
My simple and incredibly lazy recipe for slow cooking happiness –
1. Chop up a few potatoes, as many as you’d have if you were having baked potatoes. Don’t worry about peeling them, its going to be cooking for ages and you’ll not even notice them. Chuck them in the slow cooker.
2. Very lazy bit – add some frozen vegetables, whatever you fancy. Just throw them in the pot frozen, they’ll be fine. The slow cooker will be going long enough to cook them properly.
3. Chop an onion, don’t throw that in yet.
4. Chop up some meat to your preference. Steak and kidney is good. So is turkey. I’m partial to lambs hearts myself.
5. Grab a pan, put some Extra Virgin Olive Oil in and put it on the heat. Make sure its extra virgin oil, not because it’ll make any difference to the end product, but because it’ll make you feel more like a proper cook. If you really want to add to the ambience, make sure its in a poncy bottle too.
6. Throw the meat into the hot oil, knock it about a bit until it starts to brown, then throw the chopped onion in too. Make sure you turn on the extractor fan when you’re doing this, so that people passing can think you’re a proper cook because of the nice smells coming out of your kitchen. (Note, this will only work if your neighbours and anyone passing can’t cook. Anyone who can cook will know that the only reason you’ll be cooking anything savoury that early in the morning is because you’re slow cooking and therefore can’t cook at all).
7. Once the meat has browned, put the meat and onions into the slow cooker. Add in about 350ml of water, a stock cube and salt and pepper, give it a stir and set it going.
8. If you happen to be around a couple of hours before it finishes cooking, throw in a handful of paxo for some extra flavour and some thickening.
Erm, that’s it. Not exactly rocket science eh?University of Virginia Virginia financial accounting, for example, you may gain an advantage in corporate recruiting being done on-campus.

Researched here:Hello Dave, I looked for that antenna but could not find it, to understand how to mate to it. Consider using to a coaxial adapter at the antenna, TNC male to BNC female. Then put a BNC male connector on whatever coax you will be using. In an ideal world, a 75 ohm TNC will NOT mate a 50 ohm TNC. May feel like it is screwed in properly but the diameter of the center pin is smaller for the 75 ohm version. So, if you jam in a larger 50 ohm male center pin into a smaller 75 ohm female center pin, you will destroy it. Having said that, most connectors you find will be 50 ohm, just be watchful for the odd ball. I got my chromed pipe for the GPS antenna from a friend. Actual O.D. is 1.007" and the male thread looks to be a straight thread. Check the specs on the Panasonic antenna for the mating thread required. Check out the Home Depot's plumbing section for either galvi pipe or white PVC pipe. The electrical section will have a grey PVC pipe that may be more suitable and UV proof.

joy-ann.gill@barbados.gov.bbToday's question comes from a LushStories.com friend...
Coach Macy, I have been having a lot of bisexual fantasies and want to share my
wife. How can I achieve what I want and still let her know she is the #1 in my
life or is this a bad idea?
Mike
Mike,
Sweetie, this can be tricky because you don't want to blurt it out and have her
freak out... so you have got to take this one SLOW!
Depending
on how much you two already share, or what type of entertainment you enjoy,
here are a few suggestions for beginning the conversation:
If you watch porn together, do you ever watch girl-on-girl? I ask because this
tends to be popular and fairly acceptable by women. If you do watch this, have
you ever had a discussion about attraction to women or what she thinks about
it?
If you have watched, discussed, joked about it... could you bring up guy-on-guy
with her in a comparison type scenario. So, for example next time watching
girl-on-girl, you could ask, do you or your girlfriends think guy-on-guy porn
is sexy the way men sometimes like girl-on-girl?
OR
Maybe sometime after she has given you an amazing blowjob (or any blowjob ;-)
you could ask something like, "you lick me/suck me so good... it
seems you get into it, what is it you like about it?" OR "you are
amazing, what does it feel like when it's in your mouth" this can
simply get conversation about a cock in her mouth... maybe depending how that
goes, you could say something like sometimes "I wonder what it's like, is
that weird to wonder about?" just in easy conversation
OR
Do you and your wife have anal sex ever? Do you use your finger in her
ass or a dildo? Have you ever licked her ass?
Does she finger your ass while giving you a blow job? Has she ever rimmed
you?
If yes to either situation, you could do a little more of that.. or if you have
never done any type of anal play, you could start! Start with asking her
to rub behind your balls while giving you a blow job, direct her towards your
ass... moan a lot and let her know you like it, maybe she will take the hint
and do more, even penetrate with her finger... maybe not, but you can gently
work up to it.
The idea is that you want to play in similar way to what you'd do if you were
in a bisexual situation, so it can lead to a conversation about your fantasies
eventually. You have to feel it out, but if you never talk about sex right now,
then it's going to be a slow process because you'll have to build up the idea
that you even talk about straight sex!
Eventually, hopefully, you could maybe hint at, joke about, watch a movie about
4somes! talk about how it might be hot to meet another married couple and fool
around together. If she ever agrees to it, look for a couple that lists
bisexual in their personal ad so you know that it could be a possibility and
just take it one step at a time!
Hope this helps give you some ideas about how you might get started!
kisses,
MacyNew to forum. Timmins area ride May 10-11 ?

Along the way, some woodsmen spotted the groups. The infiltrators asked about security checkpoints, then attempted to indoctrinate the woodsmen and gave away some details of their impending raid. Let off with a stern warning, the terrified woodsmen reported the incident to the local police. A massive manhunt began.
n 1968, a specially selected, thirty-one man North Korean commando team from the infamous North Korean 124th Army Unit infiltrated across the demilitarized zone (DMZ) to conduct a raid on the Blue House, the South Korean equivalent to our White House, to assassinate President Park Chung-hee by cutting off his head. This special operation commando unit trained for two years and spent their final 15 days rehearsing action on the objective in a full-scale mock up of the Blue House.

We set out one day from Sancha village to stand on a section of the wall that predates the archetypal Ming Dynasty version, with its ramparts and guard towers. Depending on who you are speaking with, there is a section of the wall that dates back one thousand, perhaps two thousand years. This section is nothing more than a twenty-foot high pile of rocks. No bricks or mortar, or anything like that (once again turning our notion of the Great Wall on its head).
Our path that day started by leaving through the back door of the home of the family we were staying with, and then on to some trails that are ordinarily used for farming purposes. At this time of the year, as we quickly discovered, the trails can be rather overgrown and covered by encroaching plants (can you find Z in that one picture that Julie snapped from a few feet behind?).
In fact, things we so overgrown that we eventually decided that, with no machetes to use to hack through the brush, our best option was to turn back.
We know the Great Wall is out there...

Equally as not positioning a crown when a single is required has affiliated dangers, doing the entire process of crown placement opens the doorway for probable difficulties too.
For example, a pulpal abscess (which is usually serious, spontaneous and localized) may cause periapical periodontitis (which leads to pain on biting). Cracked tooth syndrome may also trigger a mix of signs or symptoms. Lateral periodontitis (which is normally with no thermal sensitivity and sensitive to biting) may cause pulpitis as well as the tooth becomes delicate to chilly.[9]:2–nine
Dental crowns only make the only option for earning beauty changes in situations where they at the same time serve other functions, such as restoring teeth for their first form or strengthening them.
Just like the endodontist, periodontists obtain various further decades of coaching beyond dental college. Having said that, Whilst endodontists research Sophisticated solutions, periodontists commonly have an exceptionally distinct discipline of interest. Your ordinary periodontist focuses less on cleanings and a lot more on diagnosing and managing gingivitis, periodontitis, which can be an untreated sort of the aforementioned ailment, as well as other periodontal diseases.
It may possibly at some point problems your teeth. The one way to take care of your grinding routine is to fulfill with the endodontist, who'll fit you with by using a Chunk plate to mitigate the damage to your enamel.
Since the pulp is encased inside of a rigid outer shell, there is absolutely no space to accommodate swelling caused by inflammation. Inflammation for that reason increases strain in the pulp system, probably compressing the blood vessels which source the pulp.
To perform the crown technique, your dentist prepares the tooth and will make a molded perception of the enamel to ship to a dental laboratory.
Although not as popular, these dentists may even give much more specialised more info solutions, together with some types of oral medical procedures - chief among the them root canals and restorative care - fitting individuals with a mouthguard and counseling individuals regarding how to quit smoking and what constitutes proper nutrition.
The chief criticism, along with the onset in the criticism, are usually important from the prognosis of toothache. For example, The important thing difference amongst reversible and irreversible pulpitis is presented within the history, such as pain next a stimulus in the former, and lingering pain following a stimulus and spontaneous pain from the latter. Historical past is usually critical in recent filling or other dental remedy, and trauma towards the enamel. Based on the most typical results in of toothache (dentin hypersensitivity, periodontitis, and pulpitis), The real key indicators come to be localization with the pain (whether the pain is perceived as originating in a certain tooth), thermal sensitivity, pain on biting, spontaneity from the pain, and variables that make the pain even worse.

A hate crime directed at an Asian who legally immigrated here is being investigated by police in Charlotte, North Carolina.
Charlotte-Mecklenburg police are asking for assistance in identifying a man who broke a front door window at a Nepali Indian grocery store late Thursday night and set a small fire.
When police and firefighters arrived, they discovered something else the arsonist left behind.
“A note was also left at the scene near the door that stated the suspect did not want any refugee business owners and that they would torture the owner if they did not leave and go back to where they came from,” CMPD said, according to local CBS affiliate WBTV-3 News. “The suspect signed the letter ‘White America.’”
But it’s clear from surveillance footage taken at the scene that perpetrator is African-American so it is not clear why he signed it “White America.”
The long, rambling note even threatens store owner Kamal Dhimal with torture.
CMPD describe the suspect as a black male, approximately 5’8″ and 200 pounds, with a short afro and goatee. He was wearing a gray hoodie under a black coat, light jeans and black shoes at the time of the incident.

I did not even know you can get a lawn mowing robot. I have looked at robot vacuum cleaners. You have been busy.
A lawn mowing robot!! That is fantastic! I love running into old friends. Such fun to reminisce.
I need to talk my husband into buying one of those lawn mower robots. I don't think i've seen one here in the states. Hm.....gives me an idea for Father's Day! :)
Your pictures are always so cheerful and cozy. Enjoy your weekend!!
Today I think I will go out to the grocery. It will be the first time I go out in public with my deformed face! But we need food, and so I must go. It is time I get over being shy about how terrible I look!
I've got one of those little mice as well: mint green (they didn't have pink)!
I can see how hard life must be for you. I am quite breathless!
Roundtrip of the UK? When and where?
I just love your Oscar. I want one, I want one! Must be very exhausting turning it on and off.
Oh such a tiring day you had Monday ;>)I am surprised that you had the energy to do anything else the rest of the week. Sounds like your usual fun and busy one though!
Who rakes up the grass after Oscar has cut it? Do you have a robot for that too? Glad to see you enjoying yourself again and glad to hear that you are feeling better. Hope your temps improve soon.
Daisy is soo cute. Looks like my Tanya. Just special little dogs.
That lawn robot sound so nice -- I will have to tell my husband and son about it!
Those pants are really cute!
Sounds like you had fun times with friends. How wonderful to renew acquaintance with an old friend.
Whew, I'm exhausted reading about all you had to do. ;v) It is nice to see big patches of green grass though, instead of all that snow you were showing us before.

Don’t throw away that celery! Save the banana peels! Turn your kitchen scraps into rich fertilizer for your garden. In honor of Earth Day, start a simple worm bin composting system. The whole family can participate, and it’s easy to keep up.
Several years ago, when our garden was under way and we just started raising chickens, our gardener friend Dusty suggested we try composting with worms. I knew my kids would love it and we’d end up with rich vermicast (natural, organic worm poop fertilizer) for the garden, so we headed to the (now defunct) Waikiki Worms store to take a look. The kids got to go behind the scenes and see the composting system that used leftover food from Chef Mavro’s restaurant to create the clean, black vermicast. We learned how to create bedding for the worms by shredding newspaper and adding food scraps. We bought our first worm bin from Waikiki Worms, but once we saw how easy it was to make, we made our second one.
Beloved Dusty brought a bag of worms over. Ewwww. Actually, cooool.
Start with a small, handful of worms. Feed them about a handful of food each day and keep their bedding (shredded newspaper) damp. That’s it. Six months later, the worms will have turned your leftover food and newspaper into fertilizer for the garden. Our worm bin is located in the shade under our lanai that it easy to get to. We found that the easiest way to remember to feed the worms is to do it routinely once every weekend. Throughout the week bag your scraps and freeze them. Be sure to let the scraps defrost before dumping them in the worm bin. Open the worm bin, move the top layer of shredded newspaper away, lay the food down, and cover it back up with newspaper, and adding more if needed. Drag the hose over and spray the newspaper thoroughly, until water trickles out the bottom. When it is really hot and dry outside, check the bin midweek to make sure it is not drying out.
Keeping a layer of damp newspaper on top will keep flies away. If you have all kinds of bugs inside (no flies though), it means your bin is healthy. You should have no rat problem or smell. We’ve found that avocado skins do not decompose easily. We were told not to put papaya seeds in as they affect the fertility of the worms (our chickens get those). I also read to go easy on the citrus rinds. Our worms get fruits, veggies, breads, cereal, rice, but no protein. If you DO inadvertently put some in, you might find some Black Soldier Fly grubs inside. They won’t hurt anything, they just signal the presence of protein.
Approximately six months after setting your worm bin, you can harvest the vermicast. Spread a tarp on the ground. Have a new, clean supply of shredded newspaper ready. Open the worm bin. We usually have a layer of newspaper and uneaten food near the top that can be saved and put back in when the bin is clean. Dump the bin upside down on the tarp. Rinse it out and place the new bedding inside, along with the food and newspaper you just saved. The giant pile of vermicast on the tarp needs to be separated from the worms. Break it up gently and slowly so it is not compact. We all don gloves and gently spread the outer layer of vermicast away from the center.
We collect all of the vermicast in another container.
If we find a worm, we put him in the new bedding inside the clean bin. The majority of worms will shy away from the light and burrow down towards the center of your pile of vermicast. It takes at least 30 minutes to slowly sweep the vermicast away from the top and edges, leaving the pile smaller and smaller. The end result is really cool—a worm ball!
Well-fed, well-cared for worms will reproduce, so after a harvest or two you might have enough worms to start a second bin, or pay it forward and give them to a friend who wants to get started. Honolulu peeps, I have two bins that need to be cleaned, so if you want to help, I’ll be happy to give you some worms!

* On Oahu, worms can be purchased at Kokua Worms () on Queen Street.

If you think a 1.5% drop isn’t that impressive I’d have to agree. Today’s action comes after one of the most boring stretches of trading in history, notwithstanding the fact that NY markets managed to hit new highs in the process. The most surprising thing about recent market activity, indeed, is that lack of excitement. Volatility was at all time lows before today. Even equity bulls have found it hard to square complacency and all time highs that were coming simultaneously. It’s been a very strange market since the start of 2017, with markets trading against each other in ways you rarely see.
Has all that changed now? It’s too early to tell. What has suddenly happened is that Wall St has started paying attention to the gong show in the White House. Donald Trump has been stepping in it, daily. Even a host of aides running around passing out panicked “corrections” to the Tweeter in Chief’s latest gaffes can’t keep up with it. Trump slips on the banana peels he dropped and ends up with one or both feet in his mouth several times a day. I sympathize with the West Wing staff. It must be making them nuts.
The current drop comes from disclosures that Trump did a couple of things that are dangerously close to being “High Crimes” that could, potentially, have Congress talking about impeachment hearings. Do I think that will happen? Not a chance. The GOP is not going to impeach a president who is part of their own party unless he’s taped killing someone with his bare hands in the Rose Garden. Ain’t gonna happen.
So why is Wall St suddenly concerned? The truth is, Wall St doesn’t care about Trump. They care about tax cuts, less regulation on the banking sector and infrastructure spending. They really don’t care who gets the bills passed supporting those things if they happen. The problem is that Wall St is now worried that Washington is becoming such a clown show that there will be a legislative bottleneck and their favorite cause (themselves) won’t get the attention from the politicians they think it deserves.
It’s still too early to tell if this will impact things like the Federal Reserve’s rate hike schedule. Most FOMC members are still telegraphing a rate hike next month but the recent market action has turned bond traders into skeptics again. A week ago, the bond market was pricing in 100% odds of a rate hike next month. Now the odds have dropped back below 50%. The Fed isn’t supposed to care about politics but if they see consumer sentiment weakening they might decide to back off.
One side effect of lower US yields and political concerns is a weaker US Dollar. The USD has dropped sharply in the past week as the political mess expanded. You can see from the chart below that the move it had from the “Trump reflation trade” has now fully unwound.
Can it go lower? It’s certainly possible if the White House doesn’t contain things and there are any weaker economic readings from the US. There should some support here but it’s an ugly chart. I certainly wouldn’t bet against the USD going lower until I saw a good bounce put in.
On the other side of the trade, gold put in its strongest one day performance since Trump was elected. It bottomed a week ago and a big part of this move can be traced to the fall in bond yields. The real (inflation adjusted) rate turned positive last month as inflation fell and bond yields held up. Oil, arguably the biggest determinant of inflation expectations, seems to have bottomed and yields are falling again. That helped push gold up $40 in the past few sessions.
It would be normal to see some consolidation after a move like that. Most chart analysts are still calling for a lower low in gold prices, somewhere in the high 1100’s. They might be right but I’m skeptical about that unless US leadership suddenly gets more rational. The sheer unpredictability of the political landscape should put a bid under the gold price. I don’t see the Trump administration suddenly getting professional overnight. I don’t expect a big run higher. Frankly, I’ll just be happy with some stability. HRA remains focused on high risk/high reward exploration plays that don’t depend on the day to day movements of the metals they explore for. Rising metal prices would be nice, don’t get me wrong, but if one of those companies makes a discovery I’m confident the market will reward it. My other focus developers of high quality metals resources that I think can become take over targets in the near to medium term. The majors will always need high quality, lowest quartile cost deposits and are willing to pay up for them. US politics is entertaining to watch and should support the resource sector but I’m not depending on it to either help or hurt much in the longer run.
Good luck and good trading.

Hans Betlem, Olga van Mil, Jeffrey Landlust
In november 1995 the Dutch Meteor Society organised an expedition to the Spanish province of Andalucia to monitor a possible second enhanced return of the Leonid meteor shower. 21 observers manned three Spanish stations and a fourth was equipped with Dutch camera's and manned by members of the Spanish Meteor Society. Also in the Californian Bay area a three station photographic patrol network was set up.
The visual and photographic campaigns were very successfull. More than 70 meteors were photographed from two or more stations, among them about 35 Leonids and 5 alpha Monocerotids.
From 31 Leonids radiant and trajectory data could be computed and 24 of these enabled orbital computations. The article in Radiant deals with the final photographic results for the Leonids. Trajectory data and radiant positions are presented. In 1995 only one rather compact radiant was active in the photographic domain. A very condensed position seems to mark the outburst component.
Geocentric radiantpositions, Leonids 1995 DMS. Radiant positions have been corrected for radiant drift to November 18, 0h UT and radiant from trajectories with a Q angle smaller than 10 degrees have been removed. A radiant concentration at RA=153.7; DC=+21.9 is obvious.
Radiant positions Leonids. IAU data 1938-1980 (N=25). Values from the IAU database are transferred to 2000.0 and corrected for radiant drift to 1995 November 18, 0h UT.
Radiant positions Leonids. IAU data 1965-1966. The same corrections as for the previous figure are used. There is no concentration of radiant positions as is shown in the 1995 DMS data.I was reading about ladies who trim by moon phases.

Nobody?Nobody?
I've heard of it and I plan to try it.
I've heard of it and actually used it to do my trims. Not necessarily because I'm sold on the validity but, more of a "why not"-type thing. I first used it to find the best days to do my relaxers (moist periods) and then, when I got my splitender, I used it to trim my ends (since I was trimming anyway). Again, because...why not, if I'm doing it anyway.
I have to dig for the links but, I'll post them. One site doesn't have it up anymore (site totally changed direction in subject material) but, I did copy the info so, I may have to post the info if I can't find the original source.
I'll look that up when I get back to my laptop.
Oh, and I did get great growth but, I'm not sure if I can attribute any of it to the moon cycles. But, I can't disprove either so...why not?

Due date of the next annual return is 12/6/2018 12:00:00 AM."Residents property management" is a known activity of the company.BALTIMORE, Oct. 14, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- MMA Capital Management, LLC (NASDAQ: MMAC) ("MMA Capital" or the "Company"), a Delaware limited liability company, today announced that the Company has entered into a series of transactions with Morrison Grove Management, LLC ("Morrison Grove"), related to the Company's low-income housing tax credit ("LIHTC) funds ("TCE") for the purposes of providing short and long-term economic benefits to the Company and enhancing performance for investors in the funds. Morrison Grove, a business owned and operated, in part, by the Company's former Chief Operating Officer, Charles M. Pinckney, has acquired TCE and combined it with the existing LIHTC business run by Morrison Grove. The Company also provided additional financing to Morrison Grove to fund the redemption of certain of the ownership interests in the legacy Morrison Grove tax credit equity business, and entered into an option to purchase the combined business beginning in five years.
Michael Falcone, Chief Executive Officer of the Company, stated, "This transaction achieves our goals of creating economies of scale, increasing cash flows and preserving long-term opportunities from the tax credit equity business. It creates immediate economic value for us because it converts the uncertain timing of cash flows associated with the TCE business into cash flows from a secured lending, which both accelerates and provides predictable timing of future cash flows. Through the purchase option we are able to preserve and provide for the potential long-term upside in the residual management fees from a larger tax credit equity business, potentially providing a path for significant future income. And finally, we are able to free up the intellectual capital of our senior leaders to focus on our leveraged bond business, legacy assets and strategic opportunities in the US. This transaction also allows the Company to partner once again with the principals of Morrison Grove, Charles Pinckney and Mark Johnson, both former employees of MMA Capital. Charlie and Mark are trusted business partners and we firmly believe they will enhance the value of the combined tax credit equity business."
For Morrison Grove, the acquisition of TCE, when combined with its own legacy LIHTC business, provides a significantly larger asset base that leverages its existing management business and real estate expertise. The combined enterprise has approximately $1.5 billion in equity invested, collateralized by 305 multifamily housing properties, across 44 LIHTC funds which mature between now and 2025. Mr. Pinckney, Chief Executive Officer of Morrison Grove, stated, "With the combination of our existing management platform and the ability to generate economies of scale we see a tremendous opportunity to strengthen our management business today and in the future. In addition, I am very excited that Morrison Grove and MMA Capital will be closely aligned going forward. We believe there are meaningful opportunities to add value for investors in our funds and shareholders of both companies and we look forward to working hard to realize those opportunities."
At the time of sale, TCE was comprised of the general partner and manager interests and asset management rights in 11 guaranteed LIHTC funds and two non‑guaranteed LIHTC funds. The Company retained its ownership interests in the two non-guaranteed funds. The TCE sales price of $15.9 million was entirely seller financed through a $17.3 million senior loan and a $13.0 million subordinate loan, resulting in an overall reduction to cash of $14.4 million. This cash was used to finance the redemption of certain ownership interests in Morrison Grove. The $17.3 million senior loan is designed as bridge financing that matures at December 31, 2014, subject to extension, and bears an interest rate of 10%. The $13.0 subordinate loan matures on September 30, 2024, bears an interest rate of 12%, including 8% current pay and 4% deferred. Both loans are secured by the interests in the combined Morrison Grove LIHTC management business and are pre-payable at any time. In addition, the Company entered into an option to acquire the combined Morrison Grove LIHTC management business with an option period beginning October 1, 2019 and expiring on September 30, 2024. For more details on the terms of the transactions, please see the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 14, 2014.
Primarily because the Company retained its investor yield guarantee and the $15.0 million of cash pledged towards that obligation with respect the Company's guaranteed LIHTC funds, the Company will not be able to achieve sale accounting and will therefore defer a GAAP gain of $15.8 million on the transaction. Historically, and at the date of this transaction, the Company estimated the guarantee exposure at zero.: INTEGRITY. INNOVATION. SERVICE.
SOURCE MMA Capital Management, LLC2017 Platts Nuclear Energy Conference
I was asked to speak at the Platts Nuclear Energy Conference in Washington, DC, on February 10, as part of their panel on “New Approaches to Advanced Reactor Design.”
I began my talk by emphasizing how the generation of “nuclear waste” has become a political problem, with spent fuel sites dotting the country, but that most of this spent fuel is unconsumed uranium and relatively short-lived fission products. Only a small percentage is long-lived transuranic nuclides that have special disposal challenges. The plan to put this spent nuclear fuel in Yucca Mountain runs up against the reality that Yucca Mountain would already be filled to its statutory capacity. Above-ground interim storage is a credible solution to buy time for a better approach. For seventy years, the overwhelming majority of the nuclear community has believed that fast breeder reactors using plutonium was the strategy that we should take, but with thorium and liquid-fluoride reactor technology, there is another and I believe better approach. We should fission the transuranic nuclides in a liquid-fluoride reactor jacketed with a thorium-bearing salt. This will produce uranium-233 even as transuranic nuclides are permanently destroyed. Uranium-233 can then be used to start up sustainable liquid-fluoride thorium reactors (LFTRs) that do not produce transuranic nuclear waste. Existing uranium-233 inventories at Oak Ridge and Idaho National Laboratory should also be preserved.
Flibe’s LFTR design occupies a unique corner of the design space of molten-salt reactors, different from the other MSR designs being offered.
I thought that this slide would be helpful for people to understand how the different MSR concepts compare to one another. It places neutron spectrum along the x-axis and nuclear fuels (in a continuum from thorium to uranium) across the y-axis. The thermal spectrum MSR concepts can be seen on the left-hand side. In the upper left-hand corner there’s Flibe Energy’s LFTR concept as well as the Chinese TMSR, the two approaches that are trying to achieve the admirable goal of true operation on thorium through breeding. Then there are uranium designs that are still thermal spectrum. Terrestrial Energy’s IMSR uses uranium fuel, and ThorCon’s design uses both uranium and thorium, but predominantly relies on uranium. But uranium breeding is impossible in the thermal spectrum so neither design has good fuel utilization.
Outside of the thermal designs there is Transatomic’s WAMSR design, which is intermediate in its spectrum and uses only uranium. And at the uranium-fueled, fast-spectrum corner of the design space, we find the chloride reactor designs: TerraPower’s MCFR, Elysium’s design, and the Moltex design. These reactors use a fast neutron spectrum to achieve uranium breeding, since uranium can only breed in the fast spectrum.
An outlier is the European MSFR design, which uses thorium fuel yet has a “fast-ish” spectrum, since it still uses fluoride salts. Fluorides tend to moderate neutrons more than chlorides and it’s difficult to achieve a truly fast spectrum in any fluoride reactor.“Selling Your Home Is Not The Time To Find Out You Have a Radon Problem” is the title of an earlier post shared on this page from the Maine Radon Page. However, many home sellers in southern and western Maine are finding out that they have also had arsenic and uranium problems as well.
Up until a few years ago, testing for uranium in your drinking water was not an option for many home buyers as the only lab capable of testing for uranium was the state lab. Unfortunately it took 2 weeks to get the results and that didn’t work very well for the real estate buying and selling cycle.
Local labs now have the capability of testing for uranium and getting the results back in 2 or 3 days. So now home inspectors have added testing uranium to their repertoire of services and surprise… uranium is showing up at an alarming frequency. Actually it shouldn’t be too much of a surprise as radon is a product of the radioactive decay of uranium and most people know that high levels of radon are pretty common in southern and western Maine.
The health effects of drinking too much water with high levels of uranium are changes to the kidneys that cause them to work in the wrong way. So getting your water tested for arsenic and uranium is highly recommended. Here’s the link to Maine’s tipsheet on uranium in water:new hoodemoji

They are great for exercise and other recreational activities, and can be used all year round. However, they need to be maintained properly in order to remain usable. A neglected pool can quickly turn into a hazard. The pool must be cleaned, and water should be treated and changed regularly. It is always a good idea to keep the pool covered. This is not only an important safety measure, but also has a number of other advantages. A variety of safety covers are available today to suit different types of pools.
The primary purpose of a safety cover is, of course, safety. An uncovered pool can be a hazard for unsupervised children, pets etc. Keeping the pool covered can minimise the risk of accidental drowning. Swimming pool accidents can happen in a matter of minutes, quickly and silently. Safety covers are therefore a vital precaution for any pool which can be accessed by children or pets.
A cover also prevents leaves and other debris from entering the water, keeping it clear. Many covers keep out sunlight, thus helping minimise the growth of algae and germs. Another advantage of safety covers is heat retention. Evaporation causes rapid heat loss, as well as the loss of chemicals from water. A cover can act as an insulator and help water retain heat for longer.
Many different pools covers are available, each one with its own merits. A simple plastic cover is not the most effective as a safety cover, but can be perfectly useful for keeping out leaves and other debris from the pool. It can help keep the pool cleaner for longer, effectively reducing maintenance costs. However, it cannot insulate and prevent heat or chemical loss. This is not a problem in warmer climes, but in the UK, heat retentive covers are necessary. A relatively cheap and simple way to insulate is use a vinyl cover.
The most effective covers from the point of view of safety are covers made from solid materials or mesh. These are usually very sturdy and can be pulled over the surface of the pool whenever needed. Modern safety covers are equipped with a remote operated key. This means you can cover the pool and keep it securely locked with a single turn. This is by the far the most effective types of safety cover.
Just the fact that safety covers minimise the risk of accidents is enough to get them installed. However, it doesn't hurt that they can help save money as well. By preventing heat loss, safety covers can help reduce heating costs. By keeping debris out and preventing the growth of algae, they help keep cleaning and maintenance costs down.Fleetwood Mac’s Underrated ‘Tusk’ Will be Explored in Expanded Reissue
An expanded reissue of Fleetwood Mac's underrated 1979 double album Tusk is on the way. Available in a variety of formats on Dec. 4, the set promises to shed to new light on the group's most ambitious project.
Tusk ended up selling more than four million copies, reaching No. 1 on the U.K. album charts behind favorites like "Sara," the title track and "Think About Me." Still, in following the blockbuster Rumours, that was considered a disappointment in some circles. The Grammy-nominated album's more experimental touches also confused a faction of newer fans.
It's all explored across a forthcoming 5CD/1DVD/2 LP deluxe edition of Tusk, which will also be available in a 3CD expanded edition, and a 1CD remaster.
The deluxe version includes the original remastered music, an alternate version of the complete album substituting session outtakes – most of which are previously unheard – as well as singles, demos and remixes. Highlights include an early version of "That's Enough for Me," which was then titled "Out on the Road." Two additional discs focus on performances from Fleetwood Mac's 1979 dates in support of Tusk, recorded in London, St. Louis and Tuscon. This edition is completed with a 5.1 surround mix on DVD-audio, a two-disc vinyl set, and an elegant booklet with expanded liner notes and new interviews.
The expanded edition includes the remastered original album, the alternate edition of sessions outtakes, as well as the singles, demos and remixes. Meanwhile, the reunited Tusk-era lineup continues a hugely successful world tour. Lindsey Buckingham, Mick Fleetwood, Christine McVie, John McVie and Stevie Nicks recently sold out six shows at the O2 Arena in London.

Not only do they have Dragon Ball FighterZ on the horizon, they've also got their own dream crossover in the works. BlazBlue Crosstag Battle, which was announced right after the BlazBlue: Central Fiction EVO finals, is a 2-on-2 fighter featuring characters from BlazBlue: Central Fiction, Persona 4 Arena, Under Night In-Birth, and...RWBY?
I didn't see this coming at all, and I'm sure it's going to make a lot of fighting game fans happy. I know RWBY fans have been wanting a fighting game for awhile, so this seems like the perfect place to slip one in.
BlazBlue Crosstag Battle releases sometime next year. We'll update you with more info as it arrives.

We present a test of the local Lorentz invariance of post-Newtonian gravity by monitoring Earth's gravity with a Mach-Zehnder atom interferometer. The interferometer is realized in an atomic fountain that launches Cs-atoms, cooled by Raman sideband cooling in an optical lattice. With pulse separation times of 400\,ms, a resolution of up to $8 \times 10^{-9}\,$g$/\sqrt{Hz}$ was obtained, the highest reported so far. Here we analyze a continuous 60\,h measurement of the local gravitational acceleration g obtained from this setup and two measurement runs from a previous setup (A. Peters et al. Metrologia 38, 2001). In addition to the modulation of local g due to tidal forces, we search for a modulation of local g with Earth's rotation as it would be caused by anisotropic gravity. Expressed within the standard model extension (SME) or Nordtvedt's anisotropic universe model, the analysis limits four coefficients describing anisotropic gravity at the ppb level and three others, for the first time, at the 10\,ppm level. Also, we use the SME to explicitly include possible violation of Lorentz invariance in electrodynamics. This demonstrates how the experiment actually compares the isotropy of two sectors of the SME, i.e. gravity and electromagnetJamshedpur, India

-:You all know I have a major obsession with white and blue stripes. I came across this dress on ASOS earlier this week, and I had to order it.
And then I saw this one, and I had to order it too.
And then I just kept pursuing all the other navy and white striped things I could find. I came across this dress. It reminds me of something Blair Eadie of the blog Atlantic Pacific would wear. It's crazy fabulous, but it also requires a really, really good set of abs. Not sure I could pull this off, but I am tempted to try. If only I had an occasion to wear it.
Then there is this one. It would be a great work dress....if I went to an office everyday.
And lastly, this romper is pretty fabulous. I don't own a romper, but this one is tempting me.Dec 21 2017
The Palestinian Authority is heading to another UN battle although it is sure that all the UN battles are lost as no one would help implementing them if they are against the Israeli occupation.
After the US used its veto at the UN Security Council to block the adoption of a resolution condemning President Donald Trump’s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, the Palestinian Authority (PA) immediately announced it would turn to the UN General Assembly to seek a vote on the same resolution where the US would not be able to use its veto.
Riyad Al-Maliki, the PA foreign minister, said in a statement: “The member states of the [UN] General Assembly will be asked to vote on the same draft resolution that we presented to the [UN] Security Council, which the US has blocked with the veto. In the General Assembly, the US will not be able to use this privilege.”
Though this would appear to condemn the US decision and defend the status of the holy city, this is not the reality. Egypt – which proposed the draft resolution condemning Trump’s decision on behalf of the Palestinians, the Arab and the Islamic states – could have included the US as a country that violated the international consensus on Jerusalem. This way, the US would not have been able to veto the resolution – paragraph 3 of Article 27 under Chapter V of the UN Charter stipulates that “any member that is a party to a dispute must abstain from voting”.
Instead, the text of the Egyptian, internationally-backed, draft resolution said “any decisions and actions which purport to have altered the character, status or demographic composition of the Holy City of Jerusalem have no legal effect, are null and void and must be rescinded in compliance with relevant resolutions of the Security Council”. This is a very good text, but it is useless as it does not name any country as party to the dispute over the Holy City.
Consensus on the UN General Assembly decision on the US-Jerusalem move is expected but it would not be useful because it is non-binding to the US, which makes this another lost battle by the PA and its allies.
The PA and its allies insist on going in for lost battles. Dr Abdul-Sattar Qasim, a political analyst and professor of political sciences at Al-Najah University in the occupied West Bank, said that the PA is not taking the side of their people: “They were chosen by the Israeli occupation and proposed for the US to instate them. So their existence is conditional to the support of the US and its allies,” he said.
During the UN Security Council meeting US Representative Nikki Haley noted that the US had given more than $5 billion to the Palestinians since 1994, claiming it was more than any other country. Haley was wrong because Israel is the recipient that receives the highest amount of US foreign aid. Egypt has also been a recipient of US foreign and military aid for decades. Because of this neither the PA nor Egypt are ready to gamble with losing this.
Haley considered the vote of the countries which supported the Egyptian draft resolution as an “insult” to the US and hinted that her country would take revenge for this. “What we witnessed here in the Security Council is an insult. It won’t be forgotten,” she wrote on Twitter. This is also another reason Egypt and the PA are not going in for a battle that embarrasses the US as they cannot bear its hostility.
In another Tweet posted this morning Haley overtly warned the countries which supported Egypt’s “useless” resolution at the UN General Assembly: “When we make a decision, at the will of the American people [at the UN], about where to locate OUR embassy, we don’t expect those we’ve helped to target us,” she wrote. “On Thursday, there’ll be a vote criticising our choice. The US will be taking names,” she warned.
In a letter sent to the representatives of the UN member states, a copy of which sent to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, Haley made it clearer: “The president will be watching this vote carefully and has requested I report back on those who voted against us. Thank you for your consideration, and please do not hesitate to contact my team with any questions or concerns.”

In it something is. I will know, many thanks for the information.If you have an infinity pool many people might know this as to be a vanishing edge pool; an infinity pool has three natural looking sides and the fourth creates the illusion that the fourth has vanished! It can really be a fantastic and if you create this right then your pool can look amazing and professionally done, you don't need to get someone else in to build this and cost you a lot of money. You can construct this yourself and will less time than it would to get a contractor in.
1. Final Finish Material
2. Some Wire Meshing
3. Rebar
4. Measuring Tool
5. Some Pool Plumbing Material
6. Some Trowels
7. Water, Sand And Concrete
8. A Gunite Sprayer
9. A Shovel And Backhoe
You will need to use some concrete or some tiling to set your three edges which won't be your vanishing sides, the last edge will be constructed so that it vanishes beneath the water. If you do this process correctly then the water feature can look actually very smart in deed and you might end up with something very impressive in deed.
If you find that the site is sloping then you are going to have to utilize the feature; you need to plan out about the vanishing end of your pool which should be back on the lower part of the ground so that the features looks natural.
You will need to excavate the area for your pool, so that your shovel and big out for your foundations.
You will need to start to prepare your gunite; this will be a mixture of sand and cement which will be sprayed through a nozzle onto the area that is needed to be sprayed. You will add water which will make a paste from your mixture which will need to be applied in the next step; you might need a professional in to do this for you.
To install your plumbing you will need your re-bars, take your 3/8th re-bars and space them around ten inches from one another and put in the wind wire all around them also. The gunite mixture will need to be sprayed over them now so that it will remain secure; try to get a good few coats of gunite spray on your rebar now. Take your trowel to smooth out the gunite and make this smooth and professional looking.
Now you will just have to wait for this to dry which will take around one week; you will need to add your plaster finish to the pool. You will need to get a good water source back into this infinity pool and make sure that you have got your pump installed correctly.When is to install a new bathtub and shower area. Use glass wall tile to create a breathtaking look in the shower. Glass wall tile is sleek, smooth, and easy to clean. It will give the impression of low maintenance, which is always important to buyers.
You can create glass tile patterns and designs in a number of different ways that will be both simple and appealing. The tile is easy enough to install that you can do it yourself. There are a wide range of glass tile colors, which will make it simple to find a tile that blends well with the rest of the bathroom.
Glass tile designs are as varied as the sizes and colors. You can get printed designs or use the tiles to make designs. There are patterns you can buy and follow to make it easier to create the design you want. If you have never installed wall tiles before, you may want to consult a professional or simply have it professionally done. The last thing you want is for tiles to fall off the wall or fail to be water proof when installed in the shower.
You may feel inclines to do something really bold, it maybe best to keep it subtle. You don’t want to turn off potential buyers that don’t share your flair for style. Keeping the design simple will appeal to the greatest number of people.
Wall tile can be used for all the bathroom walls; not sure the shower walls. While this is a more expensive option than simply painting the walls, it provides a more high-end look and is significantly easier to clean, which is always appreciated in a bathroom. Glass wall tile can come in a variety of smooth finishes that can be wiped clean with Windex.
Recent CommentsAug 10 2014 Who Is That Coming Out From The Wilderness?10 comments Dear friends, after more than 3 months of silence, I am back at the computer writing again. I have lost count of the number of times that I sat at the keyboard, hands poised over the letters to type, a million things in my heart that I longed to say to you… and the words wouldn’t come. They couldn’t come. I was unable to bring words out of my heart to put into writing. Maybe it was the hectic whirlwind of house renovation and wedding preparation (we got married last month, hurray!) that left me too physically and mentally exhausted to do anything more than drag myself into a hot shower and the comfort of my bed at the end of each day. Perhaps it was a traumatic experience with cyber bullying earlier this year which left me staggering under the weight of a volley of terribly wounding attacks on this blog, instagram, facebook, etc. It has taken me months to recover from the trauma and hurt of that period of time, and though I am at peace and have forgiven them, it left me afraid to write; because writing creates ripples and I definitely did NOT want to rock any boats. Maybe my reluctance to write was the inner workings of God turning the focus of my heart back to Him again. Or maybe it was just my heart crying out for time & space to be fully present in the many changes unfolding in my life. I think it was all of the above, and so much more. But irregardless of its genesis, I was undeniably in a season of wilderness. It was numbingly painful. I was frustrated and angry – with myself, with others, with God. I tried to pray, but was hopelessly unable to bring prayer out of my heart. I remember on more than one occasion lying flat out on my back, impotent and unable to utter anything to God other than a cry from my heart from months of pent-up frustration, “Lord, I have been wandering in the wilderness for so long.” I cried out for help, but God turned His ear away. So it seemed. So I stopped praying. I refused to worship, talk to God or about him, and I put my Bible away, shutting it out like a painful memory of rejection. I stopped trying to get into God’s good books. BUT THEN…. He spoke to me this morning. He spoke to me. He spoke to me!! Words of comfort, rebuke (but with SUCH love and tenderness), and a prophetic word for my beloved nation Singapore. *I will share the word I received in my next post. It was like a gulp of fresh air after what seemed like an eternity of almost drowning. I felt like a mermaid who had been trapped on land for so long, and was finally released back into the ocean. A huge weight has been lifted off my heart, and though I know that I am not fully out of this season, I at least know that I am not alone. God has not forsaken me. He is not angry with me. He loves me! But as I look back at this season of wilderness, and every other before, I can say with certainty that I wouldn’t trade it for a desert-less life. Because the wilderness teaches me so much. It has taught me that God’s grace is not by my works, but it has also taught me to keep the faith even in adversity and shadow of darkness (Ephesians 2:8). It organized my life even though it also kind of threw it into disarray – it helped me to prioritize by seeing what really matters in life, it helped me to know that so much of human strife and time is wasted on what is futility and insignificant in the light of eternity, it showed me the things that are truly worth living and dying for. The desert uncovered the true heart of myself; I might have once thought that I was holy and a pretty good Christian, but not anymore. God uncovers more of me, and in doing so, reveals more of Him, so that I can truly say, “More of You and less of me Lord.” Gladly will I admit that I am weak, for it says in the songs of the wise King Solomon, “Who is this coming up from the wilderness leaning on her beloved?” Gladly will I admit that I am barren, for the prophet Isaiah declares, “More are the children of the desolate woman than of her who has a husband.” Gladly will I remain in the wilderness for as long as I have to, because it shows me how jealously God loves me as He reveals through prophet Hosea, “Therefore I am now going to allure her; I will lead her into the wilderness and speak tenderly to her.” In the wilderness God is all we have, and we realize that God is all we need – that’s where we go deeper into the heart of Yahweh and come to know the FULLNESS of God’s care. The LORD is my shepherd – He is Yahweh Rohi, “The Lord my shepherd” I shall not be in need – Because He is Yahweh Jireh, “The Lord will provide” He makes me lie down in green pastures, he leads me beside quiet waters – He is Yahweh Shalom, “The Lord my peace” He restores my soul – He is Yahweh Rapha, “The Lord my healer” He guides me in paths of righteousness for his name’s sake – He is Yahweh Tsidkenu, “The Lord my righteousness” Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me – He is Yahweh Shammah, “The Lord is present” You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies – He is Yahweh Nissi, “The Lord our banner” (of victory) You anoint my head with oil – He is Yahweh M’Kaddesh, “The Lord who sanctifies, makes holy” My cup overflows. Surely goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.

UNIONTOWN, Pa. — A Pennsylvania woman is facing charges of endangering the welfare of a child after investigators allege her son became malnourished due to her obsession with a strict diet.
According to KDKA, 33-year-old Elizabeth Hawk was arrested after an 11-month-old boy’s father brought the child to authorities and reported his estranged wife had only been feeding the boy fruits and nuts.
“He had a severe rash,” Brandy Hawk, the suspect’s sister-in-law, told KDKA. “It was his motor skills; he couldn’t use his hands at all.”
The mother allegedly blamed her son’s issues on “allergies”, but relatives were unconvinced so they separated the boy from his mother. Brandy Hawk said the boy’s mother has extreme views on nutrition.
“She was going to live on water and sunlight,” Brandy Hawk told KDKA.
Investigators aid the boy was given small amounts of nuts and berries during a time when adequate nutrition is crucial to development. The boy could be delayed developmentally as a result. Visit KDKA for more on this story.Canadian researcher says he’s found the cure for cancer

By Karen.Blackburn, loveholidays.com team memberTwo boaters who were adrift for two days were spotted Wednesday by a good Samaritan near the Haulover Inlet, authorities said.
Miami Fire Rescue Capt. Ignatius Carroll said the men were found about 12:15 p.m. He said paramedics checked out the men as their boat was towed to Haulover Marina.
U.S. Coast Guard officials said the boaters had been fishing near Marathon when their boat became disabled and drifted off.
Local 10 News reporter Liane Morejon spoke to the good Samaritan who found the boaters about 5 miles east of the Haulover Inlet, identified only as Capt. Charlie.
Charlie, who is a charter boat captain, said he was out on his personal boat with a private client when he spotted the stranded boaters.
He said he initially found it odd that the T-top was on its side and cautiously approached the boat to see if everything was OK.
Charlie believes that the men were using the T-top as a makeshift sail.
He said once he got close enough, he realized that the men, who spoke only Spanish, were asking for help.
"I've found plenty of empty rafts, never with people aboard," Charlie said.
Charlie said he then called the Coast Guard to help get the men and their boat back to shore.
Sky 10 was above the scene as the boat was being towed to the marina.
Charlie said the men appeared to be OK, just weathered from the ordeal and sunburned.
"Just another day on the water in South Florida," Charlie said. "(You) never know what you'll encounter."
Authorities said the men are being questioned aboard a Coast Guard cutter.

REPORT OF THE TRUSTEES
APRIL 2017
“THE MCLOON PROPERTY”
Traveling on Main Street to Tyngsboro many of you may look over as you pass the McLoon Barn at the entrance of town and wonder what will happen to the McLoon property.
The short answer is that the DRLT envisions that the McLoon property will remain “as-is” retaining its present character which was the wish of Olive F. McLoon when she bequeathed her property to the Trust which wishes to preserve the entrance to the Town of Dunstable.
Shortly before her passing in 2011, Mrs. McLoon approached the DRLT to inquire about our interest and willingness to accept a bequest of her property consisting of approximately 120 acres with two houses and a historic barn.
Mrs. McLoon hoped that the property be maintained for farming and conservation purposes subject to a conservation restriction.
The Trust agreed to accept the property, subject to a life estate to be held by her son, Ronald McLoon, who had periodically used the farm to raise vegetables. The DRLT expected the term of the life-estate to last many years, but it was cut short by Mr. McLoon’s untimely death in December 2015.
What should have been a simple transfer of the life estate upon Mr. McLoon’s death became more complicated about one month before his passing when it was learned that Mr. McLoon actually held an ownership interest in the real estate bequeathed to the DRLT by his mother. Because of this lack of knowledge and proper planning, Mr. McLoon's death created some additional hurdles which were compounded by the fact that heirs to his estate reside outside of the United States. Resolution of the title to the McLoon property will be a prolonged process as there are two estates.
It is our intent over the next five to ten years to fulfill Mrs. McLoon's wishes, the DRLT will maintain as much of the open space as possible, preserving the houses and the historic barn with its distinct cupola.
How will this be accomplished? The DRLT has assumed responsibility for maintaining the property (using our available funds) to protect our future investment as well as the interests of the heirs to the Ronald McLoon estate. The DRLT anticipates a combination of a capital campaign, possible sale and/or lease of some of the real estate, and the possibility of borrowing funds should the need arise. At the suggestion of one of the Trust’s most ardent supporters, we recently applied for a grant which, if received, will allow the Trust to begin restoration of the barn and the "cupola.”
Also during this past year, the DRLT:
* contributed funds to enable the Town of Dunstable to purchase land adjacent to the Ferrari Farm (approximately 20 acres)
*
provided funds and paid for professional services to enable the Massachusetts Division of Fisheries and Wildlife to purchase approximately 15 acres near Forest Street.
* worked with other land owners desiring to permanently protect their properties, either during their lifetimes or in some cases, more importantly to carry out their wishes after death.
The DRLT accomplishments are only possible due to the support of residents of the Town of Dunstable as well as many neighbors and former residents who remain friends of our organization even after relocating outside of our town. The DRLT continues to monitor our operating expenses to insure they are limited to insurance and maintenance costs. The DRLT utilizes the major portion of contributions received for legal and other professional services to protect property, either to be owned the Trust or retained by the landowner and protected in perpetuity by conservation restrictions.
The DRLT, throughout-right ownership and/or conservation restrictions held by the Dunstable Civic Trust, currently maintains in excess of 1,000 acres, principally in Dunstable. The DRLT website (drlt.org) provides is a great resource to keep on top of what is happening throughout the year.
The trustees are very appreciative of the support received sinc
e inception and thank you in advance for your continued confidence in the mission of the Trust.

Badges or patches when placed strategically can immediately replace the look of a garment or accessory and take it from boring to spunky in a matter of minutes. If you’ve got children and they keep earning badges of merit you would want to sew them on. However, as intimidating as it might sound, sewing on badges isn’t very difficult when you know the right way to get it done.
To do this procedure of sewing on a badge, begin by placing the badge on the place where you desire it. Now secure the badge well with some pins so it stays in place and doesn’t shift while you’re sewing it on. If you are putting the patch on a garment, you ought to fix the patch after which you can try the garment on to be sure that the patch or the badge looks best suited in the place. If the patch requires a little readjustment it can be done at this point easily.
Now thread the needle being sure that the thread that you are currently using isn’t very long. Maintain the thread on a length of approximately 18inches for simple maneuvering. If your thread is simply too long then you might get bothered by knots. When you have the thread ready make a knot at the end of the thread. You could thread a needle by hand by holding the non knotted end in between your forefinger and thumb after which passing it through the eye of your needle. You may also get the assistance of a needle threader if you find threading a needle in this way difficult.
Pass the needle through the badge and also the fabric being sure that the knot is on the wrong side of the patch. Leave a space of 1/8th of an inch from which you started stitching keeping this distance from the last stitch continually. Continue stitching surrounding the entire perimeter of the badge till you have completely finished stitching it all the way through. Now knot the thread on the underside of the patch by looping your thread by using a single stitch. Pull the thread firmly to secure the knot after which you can cut-off any excess thread that’s left. Lastly take off the excess safety pins that you were using to secure the patch in position.
It’s also possible to sew on badges through the help of a sewing machine in case you don’t want to do the same manually. Pick a thread that matched the hue of the patch after which tread your machine. It’s also possible to choose a contrasting color depending on the look that you would like to present your badge. Once this is done you should start sewing you badge. Use the top of the badge as your starting point and sew all along the edge of your badge making use of the regular stitch mode ending at your start line. Once done, cut the excess thread that connects the badge to the machine and your garment is ready to be used together with the badge.Merrill FAs Grumble over Dropping Commissions in IRAs
At least some Merrill Lynch advisors appear to be angry about the wirehouse’s decision to stop offering commission-based IRA accounts, InvestmentNews writes.
In October the wirehouse announced it will no longer offer commission-based IRA accounts beginning in April, coinciding with the scheduled implementation of the Department of Labor’s fiduciary rule, the publication writes. As a result, Merrill Lynch advisors have been moving clients out of commission-based brokerage accounts and into fee-based accounts, the wirehouse’s robo-advice platform or the company’s self-directed brokerage service, according to InvestmentNews.
Many advisors are frustrated or even furious over the move, Ron Edde, president and chief executive of recruiting firm Millennium Career Advisors, tells InvestmentNews.
One Merrill Lynch broker who requested anonymity tells the publication some advisors are already losing clients with millions of dollars in assets. Another Merrill Lynch advisor who also asked to remain anonymous says the wirehouse’s decision is “unethical,” according to InvestmentNews reporting. The advisors who spoke to the publication believe that clients should have choice and that the move hurts buy-and-hold investors.
Edde tells the publication that an across-the-board move that affects Merrill Lynch’s 14,000 advisors may cause some advisors to switch firms. Denise Valentine, senior wealth management analyst at Aite Group, also tells InvestmentNews that advisors faced with such a restriction may switch to firms that offer both commission- and fee-based accounts. But there’s little indication that’s actually happening at Merrill Lynch. The firm added net 129 advisors in 2016, the publication writes.
Merrill Lynch, JPMorgan Chase, Capital One Investing and Commonwealth Financial Networks were among the broker-dealers who said last year they would transition away from commission-based retirement accounts in some or all of their businesses to help their brokers comply with the DOL’s fiduciary rule.
The rule, which requires retirement brokers to put clients’ interest first, was scheduled to go into effect this April but now remains in limbo because of a memorandum President Donald Trump issued in early February requesting a review. The DOL has already asked for a six-month delay and a new public comment period. But unlike some of its rivals, Merrill has made it clear that it will not backtrack on killing commission-based brokerage IRA accounts regardless of what happens to the rule, as reported previously.
In any case, it could be difficult for Merrill Lynch to go back on its decision given the publicity campaign it unleashed about putting clients’ interests first and minimizing conflicts of interest, InvestmentNews writes. But if the rule goes through a major revamp, Danny Sarch, founder and owner of recruiting firm Leitner Sarch Consultants, tells the publication he would be “shocked” if they didn’t change their stance.
A spokesman for Merrill Lynch told FA-IQ that the wirehouse is “focused on what our clients want from us for their retirement accounts, which is to act in their best interest and minimize conflicts in our advice.”
Merrill Lynch’s offerings include its Investment Advisory Program and the Merrill Edge platform, which offers “additional choice" through "self-directed and guided investing options.”
The spokesman says Merrill Lynch is providing clients with “pricing information for each platform option, and offering pricing flexibility to clients who choose to transition their commission-based IRA to our Investment Advisory Program.”

With the evolving world of social media and consumer dependence on the internet, more and more companies are using online resources to promote their business. Many brands, that may have traditionally hired PR Executives to help them gain press coverage, are now looking to online experts who can help them master the search engines.
Scott Malthouse works in Online PR and in this exclusive interview with Jobulo he shares an insight into the industry and gives some tips on how candidates can gain a job.
Tell Us About Your Career Background
I graduated not too long ago with a degree in Journalism and from there I worked in the Leeds City Council doing admin work while doing Freelance Journalism on the side. I started getting some work doing press releases for videogame developers through a magazine I regularly write for before moving into digital marketing as an off-page SEO Executive. From there I moved into online PR, which is where I am at the moment.
What Made You Want to Work in PR?
PR is a really fascinating industry and ever since I got my degree I knew I could either go into Journalism or PR as a career. The fact of the matter is that PR jobs tend to offer a nice amount of stability while letting me do things that I love, like news stories, interviewing interesting people and coming up with creative campaigns. I also get on well with people, so it seemed like a natural career path for me.
In Your Opinion Do You Need a Degree to be Successful in this Industry?
Most positions look for some related degree or another, whether it’s PR, Journalism or Marketing. It’s possible to learn on the job, but to really shine it’s beneficial to have a fair amount of training up your sleeve. You’re going to need to know things like media law, how to write news and what makes a great story – which are things that you’re generally taught in a degree. Personally, I don’t think I would have got where I am now without one. However, saying that experience is also important, perhaps even more important.
What Is It Like Working for An Agency?
It’s challenging! You don’t just handle one client. You are generally going to be juggling many at a time, leading multiple campaigns in different industries. It’s definitely not for people who can’t cope with pressure, but working in so many different industries gives you a wealth of experience running different kinds of campaigns. One hour you could be brainstorming a medical client, the next you’re writing press releases for a real estate client. It really keeps you on your toes.
Tell Us About Your Daily Role?
I work in online PR, meaning I focus almost purely on getting brands coverage on the internet. On a day to day basis I research campaign ideas, run competitions, pitch ideas to Journalists and monitor media coverage. It’s my job to lead on creative campaigns, promoting and evaluating their success. It’s also important for me to build relationships with Journalists, either by simply giving them a call or getting together with them for an informal coffee.
How Does Online PR Differ to Traditional PR?
Online PR is integrated with digital marketing, so while it’s a similar role, we also need to make sure that our campaigns have a positive SEO (Search Engine Optimisation) benefit for the client to help with their visibility on major search engines. That means that the way you evaluate a traditional PR campaign will be slightly different to an online campaign because you’re also looking at social shares, natural pick-up and links as part of the campaign.
What Advice Would You Give to Someone Wanting to Work in PR?
The best advice I can give is to ask yourself whether you like people and whether you’re a creative person. If not then PR may not be the best route for you. But if you are, then get some experience through an internship or some voluntary work. A course, whether a degree or otherwise, will also really help you understand how the media ticks and give you the practical and theoretical knowledge to start a career in PR.
What Do You Think Is the Most Important Thing to Show on Your CV If You Are Applying for a Job in PR?
Experience. Showing that you have volunteered or taken on an internship will set you apart from others who have perhaps got a Marketing degree but haven’t done anything since then. Showing that you have the drive and passion to work in the industry will do wonders – so definitely persist and get some experience under your belt, paid or not.The Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs on Friday announced grants to three local communities and 19 others for park and recreation improvements.

What if...
Yesterday I was working with my smallest little girl (who is 6) in a school lesson. One of the things we have been going over had been a question game called..."What if?" I would ask her a question, such as..."What would you do if a fire was in the house?"...or "What would you do if someone was hurt?" My favorite part was when I asked..."What would you do if you got locked in a candy store?" She paused for a moment then said..."I'd call 911 for help...and then I'd have a snack!"
Posted by From our family to yours at 1:34 PM
Grandmom's laughing here...how brilliant my grandchildren are! I liked the part where she'd call 911 - that's good, but my favorite part was the snack! ;-)
Love you and miss you,
MomOverview

As an undergraduate at UC Riverside, the Temecula resident pursued a degree in economics, hoping to get to the root of a deep recession that plagued Riverside County, which she had called home since she was 4.
But after she volunteered at UC San Diego Medical Center, something changed.
Scott, 28, still wanted to help people, but in a different way.
“I actually really enjoyed economics, but I didn’t feel the opportunity for jobs would be something I would be fulfilled with,” Scott said. “I wanted to have more of an impact on people’s lives.”
The Murrieta Vista High School alumna looked into jobs in medicine.
A friend suggested she try medical scribing, which involves accompanying doctors on rounds and filling out electronic charts so that the physicians can concentrate on talking with patients.
Working as a scribe provided her an up-close view of the medical field.
“Scribing was my opportunity to get a feel for it,” she said. “After doing it for about a year, I said, ‘Wow. This is amazing.’ I really got engrossed in scribing. It totally took me.”
To go on to medical school, Scott needed the required chemistry, biology, physics and organic chemistry courses, so she decided to apply to the post-baccalaureate program in health professions at Cal State Fullerton, which she recently completed.
Her dedication to her studies as a scholar earned her the university’s Miles D. McCarthy Health Professions Award. The award, named for the late biology professor who was the architect of the health professions program, honors students for their academic achievement, integrity and commitment to serve humanity.
“I was really excited because this is an award that you don’t apply for,” Scott said. “They select you.”
The award came with a $1,000 scholarship. Scott used the money to buy a laptop computer in preparation for her next adventure – starting classes next month at the UC Riverside School of Medicine.
Besides the McCarthy honor, Scott received a $15,000 Founders Scholarship from UC Riverside. The medical school funds the scholarships to offer an incentive to students who are outstanding candidates, according to university officials. The school’s mission is to produce more primary care physicians for the Inland region.
Scott also received a $3,000 scholarship from the Riverside County Medical Association.
“I’m very humbled to even get into medical school,” she said. “It’s even more exciting when they are able to offer you financial assistance.”
As she prepares to start medical school Aug. 3, Scott keeps busy working two jobs. For about 30 hours a week, she works with special needs children as a behavioral and educational interventionist. She helps children who have autism spectrum disorder, ADHD and dyslexia with problem-solving and social skills.
For an additional 60 hours a week, she continues her work as a scribe.
Deana Shaw, the site scribe coordinator and executive assistant for CEP America, supervises Scott. CEP America contracts at Southwest Healthcare System, which includes Inland Valley Medical Center and Rancho Springs Medical Center in Murrieta, where Scott has worked since 2012.
“She has been instrumental in helping me build the scribe program,” Shaw said of Scott, who is now chief scribe overseeing 32 others.
Shaw said Scott has an innate ability to think ahead and points to her ability to be proactive, focused and conscientious as key reasons she makes a good scribe.
Those qualities will help her as a doctor, Shaw added.
“I think she’ll be a very good doctor,” Shaw said. “She is thorough and has a pleasant disposition. She really cares about patients and processes.”
Scott said she is unsure which specialty she will go into, but the avid tennis player, beachgoer and online poker player said she one day hopes to travel abroad to help others through Doctors Without Borders.

Thank God moment
August

2015
By Tanya Connor
WORCESTER – A tree crushing a local Catholic’s car became a “thank God” moment Tuesday after a fast-moving storm left damage in its wake.
Claire Schaeffer-Duffy, of St. Peter Parish, said she had gone to close the windows of the Toyota Prius she and her husband, Scott, use for their ministry. They run the SS. Francis and Therese Catholic Worker House on Mason Street.
As she was trying to move the car that was parked under the tree, a huge limb fell. One arm of the tree-sized branch landed on the hood, another on the roof. Her head, inside the car, was between the two.
“This has become a ‘thank God’ site,” Claire Schaeffer-Duffy told The Catholic Free Press about an hour after emerging unscathed. Everybody who comes by says, “Thank God. You’re lucky.”
“Five to six inches in either direction and Claire would be dead,” her husband said yesterday.
The “thank God site” has become a place to give back to the couple, who give their lives in service to others and work to protect the environment.
“The important part of this story is that my mom is OK,” the Schaeffer-Duffy’s daughter, Grace Sliwoski, said in an internet “GoFundMe” campaign. “I think it’s a sign that God knows how much we all need her that she escaped this near-tragedy unscathed. But the car is destroyed and, unfortunately, there’s no insurance coverage for a tree falling on your car (at least, not on my parents’ plan.) This vehicle is incredibly important, not just as the only car for their household, but the only car for the SS. Francis and Therese Catholic Worker Community. This car transports bread to be sold each week at local churches which supports my parents’ work for peace and justice. It gives guests rides to the hospital, to job interviews, and to new housing and new lives. It carries South High students on my dad’s cross country team who wouldn’t be able to participate in sports if they didn’t have a coach that would pick them up.”
Mrs. Sliwoski posted a “thank you” from her father, which said it took them a year to raise money to buy the 2007 Prius for $11,000.
Yesterday morning he told The Catholic Free Press they’ve been overwhelmed by the response to the campaign.
“In less than 48 hours it’s raised $8,000,” he said, adding that they had found two comparable vehicles, either of which they could get for about $10,000.
Mrs. Schaeffer-Duffy said she didn’t remember hearing the branch fall after she got in the car to close the windows and back it out of the way in case a branch fell! Her panic was afterwards, wondering if she could get out. She called for her husband, who was closing the house windows, and he helped her get out the back door.
She said she felt like, “Thank you God; I have more life,” and expressed hope that she’ll use it well.
“I say every morning I’m thankful for my life, because I’m familiar with death,” she said.
As she talked, her husband and other men cut and moved branches. Mr. Schaeffer-Duffy said two Mormon missionaries happened by, tucked their ties in their shirts and worked hard. He expressed gratitude that the city moved the biggest parts of the branch free of charge.
“The peace work and our hospitality – they go on,” he said; they’re focusing on the nuclear disarmament vigil they’ve been planning in protest of the 70th anniversary of the bombing of Nagasaki. It is to be held 1-2 p.m. Sunday at Elm Park.indoor outdoor thermometers wireless user has created a wireless thermometer that measures the indoor and outdoor ambient temperature.

The title of this book attracted my attention. I had just finished reading a memoir of another Vietnam veteran and was ready to read a second one while still in that mood. Wounded Soldier, Healing Warrior immediately drew me in as it opens at the defining moment in Allen Clark’s life – 4:30 a.m. on June 17, 1967, at the Special Forces camp at Dak To, Vietnam – when a North Vietnamese mortar attack resulted in the eventual loss of both of Clark’s legs.
Mr. Clark weaves the story of his life by smoothly moving from Vietnam back to his days as a West Point cadet, back to the war, and then returning to his life before Vietnam. Throughout the book he makes the connection between how his early life prepared (or did not prepare) him for his life-changing wounds in the war and how everything that has happened to him since June 17, 1967, can be tied back to his experiences on and shortly after that day.
One theme that surfaces numerous times in the book is the lifelong influence West Point has had on Mr. Clark’s life. There is a bond among the cadets and former cadets that never failed to give the author an emotional boost when it was most needed, or helped pave the way for a career move when that was desired. This bond goes far beyond actual classmates, but spreads throughout West Point alumni. Mr. Clark describes it as a bond like no other. It is a true caring about one another.
Without being “preachy,” Mr. Clark’s overriding purpose in writing this book is to share his spiritual journey since that fateful day in 1967. He admits putting God on the back burner while at West Point. It wasn’t until his second amputation that religion became of increased interest to him. He speaks of the power of prayer. His search for a close relationship with God led him to reflect on the decisions in his life such as volunteering for duty in Vietnam, such as transferring from the Army Corps of Engineers to military intelligence, and such as requesting to be attached to a Special Forces (Green Beret) unit.
Mr. Clark talks about some of the things he learned about the Vietnamese people. He talks about how isolated he felt as an intelligence officer in the tri-border area where South Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos meet because there was no one with whom he could discuss his mission. He talks about the Montagnards and the assistance many of them gave the US troops. (Incidentally, did you know that there are 15 different groups/tribes that are Montagnards?)
The book includes the struggle many – if not all – American Vietnam veterans and their loved ones and survivors have had to come to grips with: Was my sacrifice worth it? Mr. Clark describes a turning point in his grappling with that question after a chance conversation with Bill Moyers.
Reading this book gave me a better appreciation for what amputees go through – the excruciating pain, the months that their injured limbs must in some cases be in traction to stretch the skin over their raw stumps, the months of painful rehabilitation, and transitions through increasingly useful prostheses.
One thing that I especially liked about this book was how Mr. Clark involved the other people in his life. By inviting family members, fellow soldiers, medics, and friends to write their memories of the various events in his life, Mr. Clark lets the reader see those events from several points of view.
Without giving away the amazing path Mr. Clark’s life has taken since his physical recovery, let me just say that his true character comes through as he chronicles the surprising and rewarding twists and turns of his career and some of the famous people with whom he has “rubbed elbows” as he has worked for the better care and treatment of our American veterans.
In his book, Mr. Clark talks about the various kinds of healing he has experienced since June 17, 1967, and some of the soul-searching questions he has wrestled with along his journey of physical, emotional, and spiritual healing. His journey continues.

Payday loans rely on a push of income at a single time. The repayment of the loan is also expected in a lump sum, typically the day after a payday. Subsequently, an entire future paycheck is just shoved right to a previous loan, leaving the borrower in the same hole they got into the first time.
How Short-Term Installments Work
Installment loans break the repayment up into logical installments. Borrowers will not have to exhaust their entire paycheck and end up where they started. They can stagger payments over a few months and face lower interest and fairer terms along the way. It is a more forgivable system, but it is not without some disclaimers. Borrowing should always be done responsibly and only when it is absolutely required.
Loans from Maxlend.com use a different basic system. Firstly, the cap is far more forgivable. Borrowers will not be able to exceed $1,250. Payday loan providers hardly hesitate to allow a borrower to take $3,000 or more requiring payment after the next payday. This can place them in an unfair hole, especially when a late payment is of[ten nearly a third of the total loan value. It is a destructive cycle.
Responsible Borrowing
Installment loans have lower interest rates. Though it is worth saying that the loan should be paid back in the agreed upon terms. Paying back a loan late is always cause for concern. Installment lending allows borrowers room to breathe. Installment plans are useful for small bursts of additional income over a period of time. The income is not a game changer, but it may be enough to help pass a roadblock. A payday loan is different. It is an adrenaline rush of money- and it is expected to be paid back much sooner than later with little mercy.
Neither borrowing method is completely sound. All borrowers should confirm that they will have the resources, soon, to pay back the loan properly. Whether the lender is a payday provider or an installment provider, they all want borrowers to be responsible in what they can handle.Thursday, May 15, 2014
One Hundred Years Since...
The outbreak of World War One, or nearly so. The official start was in August 1915. The anniversary is being recognized in England by, among other things, a plan to fill the moat of the Tower of London with more than 800,000 ceramic poppies, to mark the 800,000 lives lost.
The Great War looms over Up, Back, and Away and my research for the book gave me a feeling for the disaster that might have been one of the real uses of having written it at all.
A bit of news...
I have started work on a sequel to Up, Back, and Away. Don't tell anyone. A work in progress is a delicate thing. As I was working on it tonight, (forget I said that) my thoughts went back to Thomas Hardy's famous poem, In Time of Breaking of Nations, which he wrote in 1915.
Here it is, for your reading pleasure:
I read this poem when I was in high school or college. (I can't quite remember when. I went through quite a Hardy phase once upon a time). What I remembered about the poem, and what brought it back to mind tonight was not really the War, per se, but its main point. As the annotation on the poem at Poetry Genius put it:
The underlying current of this poem is that the breaking of nations is not a sustainable undertaking, and when bombs, ammunition, and (more likely) soliders run out, what will be left is what has always been left, what endures through all periods of destruction and turmoil: genuine relationships, between humans and the earth and between pairs of humans.
I thought that was very nicely put. It also, it occurred to me, might be said that the same essentials will survive underneath the surface of a prosperous, at-peace but distracted nation - like the one most of us in the US and UK know today.
My attention in the new book will be on Ada in the contemporary USA. Her challenge will not be to make her way during war, or in the war-weakened society into which she was born and raised (England just before and after the Great War) but in ours. Not too many "men harrowing clods" in Austin, Texas or Manhattan, (just a few hints...), but in finding and holding onto their equivalents in the chaos, speed, and glitter of our times. Great successes await Ada and all the trouble that comes along with it. Stay tuned.This website has been created by Robert Nantes. He is currently

...While doing my browsing through Matchbox Magazine, I came across this absolutely gorgeous plaid throw, and I was in love. Unlike the freezing cold weather and horrible rain outside, this throw looks so cozy and warm, and I just want to wrap myself in it. After a daydream or two, I got to thinking and decided that my new post would be a styling post based on elements from the throw and from Autumn (something prep-inspired, stylish, and subtle with neutrals & a touch of red) and a mini-interior decor post (something rustic(though not exactly illustrated), urban, and maybe a little antique).
Outfit:
1. Short Tailored Trench: I absolutely love this little update on the trench coat! Its so simple, yet it makes just as big of a statement as its longer counter-part.
2. Skull Black Slippers: In all honesty, I couldn't pick between slippers or boots, so I decided to put up both. I really love these slippers, and the skull design is just absolutely cool! Its almost a rebel yell on a really awesome classic.
3. Knit Sweater: Not much to say about this, but I really like the cream and white, and the fact that its striped!
4. Highwaisted Jeans: I really love the dark wash of these jeans, and I really think you can never go wrong in dark jeans.
5. Black Leather Riding Boots: Maybe this is when I should explain myself. From the moment I began working on the outfit, I knew I wanted black shoes. I couldn't decided which pair, but I absolutely love these riding boots! They really leave me speechless.
6. Cashmere Scarf: A red/maroon scarf, a small piece with a big statement.
Interior:
1. Eat Sign: For some reason, I just like this sign! I'd love to have it hung up in my future kitchen, and I love the dark metal color.
2. Antique Crystal Chandelier: This chandelier is absolutely gorgeous! I love the mixture of brass and crystals together, it just leaves me in awe.
3. Spider Web Accent Chairs: I think chairs with cool designs are amazing in any home, and this one doesnt differ!
4. Cherry Finish Mirror: This mirror is absolutely lovely! I'm developing a liking to full length mirrors.
5. Velvet Chaise: I absolutely love this chaise! From what I can see, the velvet is so pretty, and it just looks so soft and comfy.
6. Mixed Photo Frames: Whats not to love about classic black photo frames to fill with memories?
7. Sea Salts: I find sea salts really interesting, especially the colors! These would make an amazing way to decorate your home.
8. Plaid Throw: The throw that started it all! I absolutely love it! Its so gorgeous, it looks so cozy, and it just brings so many different elements together in one!

Locomotives give life to coaches and wagons which are otherwise dead hunks of metal which can best qualify as shelters during rains, converting them into trains. Locomotives work based on a really simple principle. Be it diesel or electric, locomotives are actually “run” by a set of electric AC induction motors called traction motors attached to their axles. These motors need electric power to run, and the source that supplies this power is what differentiates diesel and electric locomotives. Traction motors are electric motors which are a really bigger, extrapolated, enhanced, more complicated and powerful version of the conventional electric induction motor seen in electric fans, pumpsets etc. The electric power derived from a source is fed to traction motors which run and turn the wheels of the locomotive, the remaining being only details.
In addition to the power output of the engine, many other factors like tractive effort, gear ratios, top speed, weight of the locomotive, axle load, adhesion factors etc also determine the type of service and work the locomotive will be used for, whether for hauling freight, passenger or both (mixed type). This goes for both diesel and electric locomotives. Today’s locomotives are all microprocessor controlled which help them to work efficiently and productively. These computers continuously gather and analyze data to calculate the optimum power required by each axle of the locomotive for its best performance according to the load, grade, speed, adhesion factors etc. They then supply the right amount of power to corresponding traction motors. Supplementing this are all the supporting functions of the loco such as advanced suspension, batteries, Dynamic Brake Resistors, radiators, exhaust and cooling systems, braking and sanding equipment etc.
How Diesel Locomotives Work
A “Diesel Locomotive” is a self-powered railway vehicle that moves along the rails and pulls or pushes a train attached to it using a huge internal combustion engine running on Diesel fuel as the prime mover or the primary supplier of power. However unlike conventional automobiles, modern diesel locomotives have no direct mechanical connection between the engine and the wheels, hence the power generated by the engine does not really “turn the wheels”. The purpose of the diesel engine is not to run the train but to turn a huge electricity generator/alternator which produces electric current (earlier Direct Current, nowadays Alternating Current), then passed through a rectifier to convert the AC to DC if required and is then transmitted to traction motors which then produce the actual (rotational) torque that turns the wheels of the locomotive. Hence, the function of the diesel engine is only to generate power for the traction motors and auxiliary equipment like compressors, blowers etc. Most Indian diesel locomotives have six traction motors, one for each axle except the WDP4 with only four traction motors for six axles. Indian Railways engines have 16 cylinders in V configuration (V16) except for some of the lower powered ones including the WDM2 with only 12 cylinders and the WDG5 which has a V20 engine!
Contrary to popular belief, electric locomotives are much older technology (1881) compared to diesel (1938)! Hence, diesel locomotives work on the same principle as on electric locomotives. It would not be wrong to say that diesel locomotives actually run on electric power, which is why locomotives using this technique of operation are called “Diesel-Electric”, which includes all mainline diesel locomotives in India. In older times there were Diesel-Hydraulic locomotives which had the diesel engine directly driving the wheels through a set of gears like automobiles, but were not only complicated but inefficient and troublesome as well and were replaced by Diesel-Electrics. When we say “transmission” for locomotives, we mean the method or type of electricity transmitted from the engine to the traction motors. Some of the earlier locos had DC (Direct Current) transmission, but all the newer models have AC transmissions and all functions within the locomotive are controlled by computers. The diesel loco is actually quite a sophisticated piece of equipment though does not look it the part. Diesel locomotives are fiercely independent, hugely flexible, can run anywhere and anytime as long as they have enough fuel in their tanks. A generator on wheels that produces its own electricity to run itself!
Diesel Locomotives are basically giant self-propelled electricity generators.

How Electric Locomotives Work
An “Electric Locomotive” is a railway vehicle that can move along rails and push or pull a train attached to it using electric power drawn from an external source, usually from overhead cables or a third rail. Electric Locomotives, be it a standalone unit or the powercars of an EMU trainset, work on the single principle of drawing current from external sources and then after sufficiently “modifying” it feed it to the traction motors which turn the wheels. This “modification” of the electric current is aimed at supplying optimum power to the motors for optimum performance under different conditions and loads, involving a complicated process of conversion, reconversion, smoothing and transformation of the current to varying values of frequency, Voltage, Current etc, using banks of components like transformers, rectifiers/thyristors, inverters, capacitors, compressors and other such paraphernalia, housed within the locomotive body or the “shell”. In fact, it is this process of “modification” or transformation what electric locomotive technology is all about. Electric locomotives do not have a central “Engine” or a prime mover drawing parallels to the diesels, one can say that the traction motors are the actual “engines” of the electric locomotive.
There are actually two ways electric locomotives can be classified: one is as per the type of current they draw from the lines (traction power): DC (Direct Current) or AC (Alternating Current), or as per the type of traction motors they use (drives): Those with Direct Current (DC) traction motors or those with 3-phase Alternating Current (AC) traction motors. Both AC and DC drives can work on both AC and DC traction. The main function of all the equipment housed in locomotives is to convert receiving current to make it optimal to use for traction motors.
How (Drive Control) of Electric Locomotives in India Work
The torque put out by traction motors is directly proportional to the current they receive. For starting the train and for accelerating from low speeds they need to put out more torque hence require more current, and vice versa. The process of controlling this power output to traction motors and thereby the speed of the locomotive is called “controlling the drive” and is carried out completely different for locomotives with AC and DC motors.
DC Drive: Older locomotives in India with DC traction motors used silicon-controlled rectifiers, the current to which and to traction motors was controlled by a device called a tap-changer. Single phase AC received through the Pantograph is passed to the transformer where it is stepped down to manageable levels. It then passes through the tap-changer which according to the input from the driver selects the optimum current required to power the traction motors by “tapping” it from the secondary transformer coil at the appropriate position (Current is different at different points of the winding), which is then passed to the main rectifier (SCR) that converts the AC into DC. After passing through a smoothing reactor to remove fluctuations in the current, it is fed to the traction motors which turn the wheels. In the loco cabin, the loco driver would turn a handle/wheel up and down “notches” 1 to 32 to control the acceleration/speed of the locomotive, where each notch actually specified a point on the winding where the tap-changer would tap current from. Notch 1 is the starting point where maximum power would be drawn as starting up from a standstill requires most torque. As the loco accelerates, lesser torque will be required and accordingly the pilot will move up the notches and at notch 32 the loco will be at the highest speed with the least current output. The tap-changer can be said to be the “throttle” of the electric locomotive.
AC Drive: Three-phase AC locomotives use contactless semiconductor devices like GTO Thyristors (Diodes) or IGBTs (transistors) to control their traction motors. The 25 kV single phase AC current received by the Pantograph will be as usual stepped down by the transformer and passed on to the main GTO Thyristor/IGBT-controlled rectifier which converts it into DC (2800V for WAG9) which passes through a bank of capacitors and inductors where it is smoothed, called a DC-Link. The DC is then sent to the main inverter, again consisting of GTO/IGBTs which will convert the DC into 3-phase AC as required (2180V for WAG9) which is then fed to the motors driving the wheels. During this entire process, the current output to the traction motors will be controlled by varying the output currents/voltages across all components by the Thyristors/IGBTs on command by the microprocessors controlling the locomotive as per instructions from the loco driving cabin. The entire setup is called a VVVF (Variable Voltage Variable Frequency) drive and is seamless and efficient. No more tapping or changing.
In both AC and DC drives, the appropriate output power from the rectifier or inverter is also used to power all the numerous auxiliary equipment in the loco such as blowers, fans, compressors, lights, meters, batteries and so on. And there is a lot more equipment to fine-tune all current at different stages for best use by equipment. AC drives and semiconductor devices are more efficient since they have no moving parts, lighter, generate less heat and are easier to maintain. In India, older DC motor locos like WAM4, WAG5, WAG7 and WAP4 locomotives use tap-changers while 3-phase AC WAP5, WAP7 and WAG9 locos utilize either GTO Thyristors or IGBT drives.
The major drawback of electric locomotives is that they are. However, electrics are always faster and powerful because no diesel engine can generate electricity that can match the power and efficiency of drawing and manipulating electricity directly from the grid.
Electric Locomotives are basically giant electrical transformers on wheels.

The Diesel vs Electric Question
By around the end of the 1950s when it had become clear that the future did not lie in steam traction and it had to be done away with, the question arose on what technology of locomotive propulsion we should be adopting going forward. The contest between Diesel and Electric traction was fierce, a debate that continues to this day. The major factor in the argument was, of course, the cost. Diesel seemed to be low on tech and speed but traction was favored to be cleaner, faster, more “modern” and powerful but was voted down because it entailed heavy investments in technology and infrastructure. Lines had to be electrified by creating circuits, planting poles, drawing cables for hundreds of kilometers and establishing tens of substations, all which would run up unimaginable costs in terms of material, labour, and technology, though it would be a one-time activity which could outweigh Diesel costs in the long run. So Diesel won the race initially and it was decided to electrify only the most major trunk routes and suburban lines (HWH-NDLS/CSTM, NDLS-BCT etc), while most other lines would run diesel. But the 1973 oil crisis changed everything. To reduce our reliance on costly imported oil and for more efficient operation, an almost knee-jerk decision was taken to aggressively electrify all major routes at a target of 1000 km a year, starting 1979. This is still going on, though the pace of electrification has slowed down substantially. But still, electric had won.
Electric locomotives are faster, more efficient and powerful compared to Diesel Locomotives which are more flexible to operate. But even then an all-out blanket electrification of all routes in the country is never feasible. Electrification of railway lines come at a huge, huge cost, and it should be carried out only if the gains and savings are substantial in the long run. Diesel prices may be going up, but even then it makes no sense to electrify branch lines which have only six trains passing daily., suburban commuter lines, lines with high-density long-distance traffic with frequent stoppages like the entire state of Kerala, Coimbatore – Chennai, Mumbai – Ahmedabad, Chennai – Bangalore – Mysore, Mumbai – Pune, UP/Bihar etc. For low volume traffic lines, ghat sections, rainy areas and heavy freight routes, diesels are the best suited because of volumes. As the saying goes, a non-electrified double line is always better than an electrified single line. Indian Railways, fortunately, seems to be headed in this direction which makes sense and hopefully will prevail.
Why Separate Locomotives for Passenger and Freight Traffic? What are “Mixed” Locos?
A doubt many people have is: “Why are there separate locomotives to haul passenger and freight trains? And why another “Mixed” type?” “What is the difference between, say, a WDP4 and WDG4 or a WAP7 and WAG9, since they all have the same engines/traction motors and power?”
The answer is simple. Passenger trains need speed (power) while freight trains need pulling force (torque) which requires locomotives to be designed differently to cater to these two needs. Imagine you starting off an empty car versus a car fully loaded or with a trailer attached. This is the same case in point. Loads that freight locomotives have to pull will be many hundreds of times heavier than that of passenger trains, requiring goods locomotives to have more “Starting Traction” force or torque, adhesion factor (Grip) and overall weight to get all that load moving from standstill, else the wheels will lose grip and just spin on the track, called “Wheel Slip”. This torque, however, comes at the cost of speed, but speed is not important for freights. Passenger locomotives, on the other hand, can be lighter and less torque-y to achieve higher top speeds. For two locomotives with the same power rating, this is achieved majorly by two things: weight of the locomotive and their gearing. Freight locomotives must be heavier and have lower Gear Ratios (traction motor gearing) to make the locomotive to be able to transmit more force to its wheels giving them increased starting torque to pull heavy loads, while passenger locomotives must be lighter and have higher Gear Ratios to achieve higher speeds at low torque. This also makes freight locos capable in hauling passenger trains but we rarely see a passenger loco haul freight trains. Mixed locomotives tread the middle path and try to balance both speed and torque as a compromise, making them good and bad at both. In modern 3-phase locomotives, software for the computers controlling the locomotive also plays a part in deciding what load the loco should handle. All this is applicable for both diesel and electric locomotives.
Let us see how the WDM3A, WDP3A and WDG3A and WAP7 and WAG9 are different from each other.
Indian Locomotive Classes, Types, Statistics and Explanations
Since its formation in 1948, the Indian Railways has operated 92 different classes of diesel and electric locomotives. Only four types of Steam engines were widely known to be in service, the WP, WG, YG and YP class locomotives, which were all withdrawn from active service by the late 1980s. Today, the scene is dominated by Broad Gauge AC Electric and Diesel Locomotives. Here is a drill down of the classification of these locos in terms of Gauge, Traction, and Load, based on how many are diesel and different types of electric traction. For example, there have been 6 classes of Broad Gauge AC Electric Passenger Locomotives, 11 classes of BG Diesel Mixed locos, 1 class of DC electric Goods loco, total 13 classes of AC electric Goods locos and 9 classes of Meter Gauge locos and 50 types of Diesel locomotives in all and so on. In the next parts, we will check out most of these loco classes one by one, starting with the Diesels.

Love it - Great app, use it a ton its one of the few PDF apps that really makes it easy to organize a big file and put things in different order. The full screen view mode with all pages as thumbnails is ridiculously useful. OCR also works really great. Only problem is that the app store version is not the newest version, and I would like to be able to have that version. Emailed support and haven’t heard back yet, but i will give benefit of the doubt and not reduce to a 4 star, as long as they will give me a liscence for the non apple store one if they cant update it here.
Zero stars - v2.2 Crashes almost instantly in Mavericks. It is particularly bad with PDFs that contain plots, vector graphs & other rendered postscript. Will ask for refund at once. I hope your mileage does vary, because mine didn’t even get me out the door.This promotion is for Rewards members only.

(Before I fell off my couch in jubilation during the 9th inning comeback.) I’m toggling over to some show about the Craigslist killer. The police admit this guy got caught because he was stupid. Imagine if he had a smidge of tech training (or watched The Wire.) He gets a burner cell phone (Stringer Bell would be proud) maybe an IP spoofer, a fake email address and uses an internet cafe across town. BAM its that simple and he’s a ghost.
And I get to thinking… Every For Sale By Owner should be watching this. Imagine Mr. or Mrs. Seller puts an ad online or in the paper. Craigslist Killer Guy (CKG) comes a calling. Probably chats them up. Sellers always say too much….”Oh my husband won’t be home at 5pm but I’ll be there.” CKG even gets to see cool pictures of your stuff. If you’ve got nice furniture, you probably have an ipod, video camera, a watch , jewelry etc. It’s like online shopping for CKG. In this economy, people are looking for a way to make a living. So the FSBOs put themselves at risk just to save money on a place they won’t be able to sell.
These are desperate times for some. Think I’m kidding, last week a guy dressed like a waiter with a yellow tie in Hoboken and walked off with people’s cash, twice in the same night.

Speak Your MindMOON TOWNSHIP, Pa. (AP) Mathew Barr threw an 84-yard touchdown pass to Kyle Buss with 3:18 left in the game and Cole Blake added a 12-yard scoring run just under two minutes later to help Robert Morris overcome a late 9-7 deficit and beat East Tennessee State 21-9.
Barr finished with 225 yards passing and two touchdowns for the Colonials (3-6). Buss added 138 yards receiving on nine receptions with a touchdown, and Blake had 83 yards rushing with a TD.
East Tennessee State (1-8) entered the fourth quarter leading 9-7 on the strength of three JJ Jerman field goals. After the Barr to Buss touchdown strike gave Robert Morris the advantage the Buccaneers had an opportunity to retake the lead but turned the ball over on downs after gaining just three yards in eight plays.
Falon Lee had 73 yards rushing for East Tennessee State. Jajuan Stinson added 71.Being a geek, I love thinking about the next technologies that may make a splash. One technology whose time is slowly approaching is wide-range ad hoc networks.
We're nearing a point where ad hoc networks among personal devices will become very common. You're probably already using wireless keyboards and connecting your phones to wifi networks - both of which are examples of a nascent, budding ad hockery between our various devices. Your thumb drive is only an inch away from not needing to be plugged in. Your DS is only an inch away from being able to interact with people playing the same game on their phones.
In addition, the technology has reached a level where individual people can create/deploy large numbers of ad hoc wireless nodes. Hell, we're maybe a year away from being able to print them on our home fabricators, aside from a few generic parts like batteries.
It seems to me that, even though nothing has really started moving yet, this is about to explode. Especially when net neutrality fails and the EU passes its internet censorship bill.
A lot of people want to fight against governments and corporations screwing up the internet, but I'm more interested in what comes next. It seems far more likely that geeks can come up with a new technology that slowly replaces the internet, and far less likely that geeks can oppose all the money on the planet working against them. So, I'm betting on ad hoc networks.
What I see initially is ad hoc networks largely limited to your personal devices - your computer recognizing your phone, and your lights detecting your iPad, for example. Already happens to a large extent: every time someone turns on the 360, my computer tells me I should share my media with them. If my DS is near another DS playing the same game, it often pops up and offers trades. I simply predict more of it.
I see this network expanding to allow approved foreign devices. Your friend's phone automatically connects to your phone and tags your friend's location when he's in walking range. Hold up your phone, and you see markers where your friends are. This voluntary sharing requires fewer privacy breaches since A) your friend is only reporting his position to you, not to a central network, B) your friend is free to obscure or hide his presence in any way he sees fit (or lie), C) you do not have to report your position to him.
This kind of connectivity will rapidly grow into a painfully insecure ad hoc network that supports your game playing habits, connects you to random passerbyes because you signed up for the same dating service, pops up today's menu from the restaurant you're passing, and trades computational data about traffic patterns.
At this point, the ad hoc network will shoulder more and more of the bandwidth that a user tends to use. Not because it's good at it, but because it's available. A lot of products will come out that rely heavily on short-range ad hockery or extending ad hoc networks to wider areas. Ad hoc networks will begin to integrate with internet connections, such that a phone browsing the internet might connect to a node through an ad hoc network instead of relying on a 3G connection.
The nature of ad hoc networks of this size strongly favors individuals and open source products. Even if a corporation or government seeds an ad hoc network with a few thousand nodes, it's unlikely they'll keep up the project, and it's also likely they'll have misimplemented something (on purpose or on accident). Individuals are likely to deploy their own devices (either stationary or carried) to take advantage of better technologies, better implementations, and higher security. In addition, owning a reliable ad hoc node will probably give good karma and interesting tidbits of information.
Once a baseline ad hoc network reaches a certain level, it essentially replaces the internet. It may use many of the same data backbones for ease of long-range high-bandwidth transmission, but even if you are surfing "the internet", you are surfing through a largely anonymous connection via an untracked route. Similarly, you probably won't be surfing that obsolete old thing any more: a large ad hoc network will support applications and data presentations we will have a hard time imagining. But they'll be just as much part of our day as the internet is today.
(There are some REALLY wacky things you can do with large ad hoc networks, especially ones with moving pieces. But that's definitely a whole other article. Lets just say that the most straightforward few of them are augmented reality.)
Anyway, I've spun a tale of large ad hoc networks springing up in the relatively near future. Let's say... five years from now, it'll be obvious they're starting, and in ten years they'll be a major part of many lives.
As predictions go, I'm pretty comfortable with it. There are a lot of barriers in the way, but most of those barriers go away instantly if individuals can manufacture low-energy wireless relays in their spare time, or buy open hardware versions on the cheap.
I just can't imagine the internet remaining as it is today. It's so... seventies. And the only route I see away from the internet involves massive ad hockery.
Fortunately, if there's one thing we geeks are good at, it's ad hockery.Most popular

Its thin lift of hotmix asphalt over a silty sand subgrade was adequate then, but in the heart of modern-day Hollywood, the road is not winning any Oscars. The city of Los Angeles Bureau of Street Services was charged with finding a cost-effective urban street reconstruction process.
The solution for this innovative agency was found when the city went to Palm Springs to see a solvent-free cold in-place recycling Reflex project on Highway 111, a project that produced good coating and an engineered approach to mix design. But the city still had reservations because it felt the recycling train was too large for an urban environment and that a majority of the streets did not have an existing asphalt section thick enough to support the recycle train.
Within two years, the city solved part of its problems by purchasing a Wirtgen 2200 recycling machine-smaller and more compact. In October 2005, the city set up a test section with SemMaterials L.P. to try the Fortress process using asphalt emulsion on Ogden Drive, just two miles from the famed Paramount Studios. Fortress is a process for full-depth reclamation that consists of an engineered mix design, performance- related specifications and an innovative asphalt emulsion to produce a flexible bituminous stabilized base that is strong enough for traffic before surfacing and improves cracking resistance and moisture susceptibility.
On the Ogden Drive test section, the city needed a process that could be utilized for both full-depth reclamation and cold in-place recycling. The test section consisted of two city blocks and was 30 ft wide. The recycling depth was 4 in., while the road structure was 2 1/2 in. of cracked, aged pavement that, according to some residents, had received only minimal maintenance over the last 40 years. Intersections were at least 4 in. of asphalt.
For Ogden Drive, the city used its Wirtgen 2200 recycler, with the built-in tamping bar screed-the only machine of its type in the U.S. The recycling machine was followed by two Hamm rollers, allowing the 30-ft-wide project to be reclaimed curb to curb with the elimination of some typical equipment. For the cold in-place recycling streets, the pug mill crushing unit and paving machine were eliminated; for the full-depth reclamation, a padfoot roller and motor grader were eliminated.
After the pulverizing and mixing of the Fortress mix was complete, traffic returned only two hours later. A 2-in. hot-mix overlay was applied five days later. The residents were thrilled they had access to their homes throughout the entire construction process.
One of the leading innovative agencies in the nation, the city of Los Angeles, along with SemMaterials , expects that other agencies will see the impressive results of the Ogden Drive project and also will venture "out of the box" to strike gold.I am just so freakin' aggravated right now. I was supposed to get a call from my adviser at WGU at 3:15. I put off everything else I had to do so that I could have some quiet time to talk to her. I didn't get any calls until 3:50 (this is not the first time this has happened) and it wasn't even my adviser. The assistant called me to tell me that my adviser left early and she had rescheduled me with another adviser but that one left early also. So I'm not very happy about that right now, and she tells me that one of my transcripts did not make it in yet (I had them sent rush two weeks ago) and they had a meeting today to drop me and she didn't have the results of the meeting. I delayed entry last month due to some of my other colleges dragging their feet on sending the transcripts.
Now, I am also attending one of the community colleges in my area, finishing up my last two classes before I graduate. I enrolled now because I was told by the adviser that I could do so and transfer my AA when I finished it.
Well...come today I was told by her assistant I cant do that. I need to finish the classes I am taking now or they wont count. I dont understand that. What if I earn education credits at the job I have. Will those not count???? Ugh....I am so aggravated now. At least I got confirmation from the assistant that my application fee wont be effected and I wont have to pay it again. Looks like I wont be starting my BA in Special Ed until at least January. I just cant even explain how upset I am right now. :\

“We are getting out,” Mr Trump said.
“But we will start to negotiate, and we will see if we can make a deal that’s fair. And if we can, that’s great.”
Yet, shortly after his address, leaders in France, Italy and Germany issued a joint statement that the climate accord would not be renegotiated.
The Paris Agreement was established in 2015 to strengthen global response to climate change and limit global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius.
It was signed by more than 190 countries, and has since been ratified by 146 countries, including Australia, which announced its formal commitment in November last year, less than a day after Mr Trump was voted in as US President-elect.
Federal Energy minister Josh Frydenberg said the news of the US withdrawal was disappointing, but Australia would “follow through”.
“It’s important to have all the major emitters in the world participating in an agreement such as this,” Mr Frydenberg told ABC.
“It’s clearly preferable to have the US at the table.
“I’ve spoken to our Prime Minister this morning, who has just landed in Singapore, and we reiterate our commitments to the Paris accord; we believe to the targets we agreed to, a 26-28 per cent reduction in our emissions by 2030 from 2005 levels, are reasonable [and] achievable.
“We will beat them just as we beat our first Kyoto target, and we’re on track to beat our second Kyoto target.”
Mr Frydenberg said the targets of the Paris Accord were “reasonable” and “achievable”.
“I do believe that it is still a very meaningful agreement,” he said.
“Even without the US, around 70 per cent of the world’s emissions are covered by that agreement.”The ocean lighthouse car Seagull – PSD material

Laughter Made from Experience by Lola Gillebaard.
“The book is a collection of vignettes about one woman’s life: getting married, raising four sons, surviving breast cancer, and everything else in between,” Dumas says. “Gillebaard has a natural writing style that makes you feel like you are having coffee with a wise aunt, someone who has lived a full life and has the gift of recounting it with humor and warmth. She does not have a publicist or big publishing house promoting her book. It was one of those great finds that makes you realize that ordinary people often make the best subjects.”
Firoozeh Dumas was born in Ibadan, Iran and moved to America at the age of seven. She is the author of the memoir Funny in Farsi: Growing Up Iranian in America.The death has occurred of William ‘Willie’ Meehan, Ballykerin, Modeligo, Cappagh

058 422 00Some of the stress that came out in my previous post has been dealt with now. Or at least a plan has been made for dealing with it. So that's good.
This morning I took stock of my proto-job-talk and the net result of my latest research binge. The proto-job-talk is actually in decent shape. Talking about my work in a different part of the country is going to require some additional information to be conveyed in the background sections, but I don't think I have to change much in terms of slides. And I am starting to identify some key graphs and results from my recent work that I'd like to talk about. Now I just have to get them looking pretty, be really sure of what they're telling me, and make sure I understand their context. Then I've got to figure out how to integrate them into the narrative arc of my talk. And then, practice, practice, practice...tinker, tinker....practice, practice, practice.
Don't expect to much of me in terms of posts in the next two weeks. Between the in-laws, the interview prep, and then the interview itself, I don't expect to have the bandwidth to write intelligent posts. But I will keep reading your blogs...

Glad to hear you're feeling better about your job talk! Good luck with the coming interview (and the in-laws).
We just finished a round of interviews for a permanant curator position at the museum. Amazingly, all three interviewees were women in the early stages of their careers - all with phds and postdoc experience. As a postdoc, myself, I paid close attention to their talks and interpersonal skills. I thought I would give a brief list of observations/advise to inspire you, Science Woman.
1. Enthusiasm goes a long way. Be sure to exude excitement for your own research as well as the ideas of your potential colleagues.
2. While they suggest that you give a general science audience talk, don't dumb it down. Present the real science and how it is important. Make the slides clear and present them clearly.
3. Be sure your science doens't neglect the complications in your research. Admit the short falls to your research and be willing to hear new ideas or brianstorm ideas for how to address the problems. Nobody's perfect and sometimes it takes a lot of different kinds of experiments to come up with a final answer.
4. Be interested in other people in the department. Introduce yourself and find out who everyone is. People will be flattered by your interest.
5. Have a good idea of what it will take for you to be successful at the insitution. What supplies, lab space will you need. Try to come up with a dollar amount for critical lab supplies. Also, have a good idea of where future funding will come from, even if you haven't been a PI yet.
6. Have a very good answer for the question "Why do you want to come here?" The answer should not be "because I hate where I am now" or "because I don't know where to go after I graduate." Focus on the positive aspects of the department - the location for future field work, the facilities, the people, the range of students, teaching.
7. Have confindence in yourself. Others can read it in your posture or speech patterns. Effervesce your intellect and special qualities.
GOOD LUCK! You rock, Science Woman! I'll be in touch.
xoxo, Volcano Girl
Your readers have such great words of wisdom for you! You have my constant support, admiration, and encouragement. I'm rooting for ya! I'm always sending good vibes your way. When you go for your interview I'll be sure to redirect my vibe sender so they reach you there too!Website Worth and Statistics for Domain: kesound.com

LINKS:Family-friendly push from Canadian firms A new study of Canadian HR managers has suggested a promising trend towards supporting working parents after more than 60 per cent said their firms had introduced family-friendly policies in the past five years. Commissioned by Office Team, the study also compared which perks are most favoured by employees with the ones organizations are most likely to offer. The clear winner – for employees at least, was flexible hours. A huge 69 per cent said that perk in particular would have the greatest impact on their decision to work at a company. Reassuringly, almost the same amount of employers (67 per cent) offered the option. Telecommuting was also important to employees and 20 per cent cited it as the most influential perk while 39 per cent of HR managers said their organization offered the benefit. After a notable drop in interest, maternity and paternity leave took third place for employees at six per cent while a huge 84 per cent of employers said they offered the perk. Just four per cent of employees said a childcare program would have the biggest impact although 17 per cent of HR managers offered it and only one per cent of employees said adoption benefits would be the most influential while 20 per cent of HR managers offered it.  also noted that the benefits could play a role in not only attracting and retaining employees but keeping them happy and engaged too. Better balance is something everyone appreciates,” she said. “Perks like flexible hours and telecommuting can help ease the demands of personal obligations, ensuring staff remain focused and productive at work."

Video: Rocket Launcher - June 10, 2015
Daily posting, this video originally uploaded on November 6, 2014, showing the Rocket Launcher weapon type.
Rocket Launchers are very powerful weapons, dealing 6x damage to a large area at unlimited range. Unlike Rifles, enemies can't protect their friends using Shields, making the Rocket Launcher ideal for taking out groups of enemies at long range.
However, despite these massive advantages, Rocket Launchers have equally massive disadvantages. They hurt allies and enemies, which means you will likely not be using Rocket Launchers in combat, and ironically more from a stealth standpoint. They also only have 2 ammo max, so unless you have ways to boost maximum ammo or refill ammo in combat, your Rocket Launcher usage may be short-lived.
Rocket Launchers are also loud, which draws enemies to the source of the noise, though this can be considered an advantage or a disadvantage.

[December 2014 through November 2015 temps of] 1.06 C Above 1880: Climate Year 2015 Shatters All Previous Records For Hottest Ever.
Robertscribbler 14 December 2015
We knew it was going to be a record breaker. We knew that atmospheric greenhouse gasses in the range of 400 parts per million CO2 and 485 parts per million CO2e, when combined with one of the top three strongest El Ninos in the Pacific, would result in new all-time global record high temperatures. But what we didn’t know was how substantial the jump would ultimately be.Today, the numbers were made public by NASA. And I hate to say it, but it’s a real doozy. Overall, according to NASA, Climate Year 2015 — the 12 month period from December of 2014 through November of 2015 — was 0.84 C hotter than NASA’s 20th Century Baseline. That’s 0.11 C hotter than previous hottest year 2014 and a full 0.21 C hotter than climate change deniers’ favorite cherry — 1998. In other words past record hot years are being left in the dust as the world is heating up to ever more dangerously warm global temperatures.. This year’s 0.84 C temperature departure above NASA’s 20th Century baseline is 1.06 C hotter than 1880s values. It’s a number just 0.44 C (or two more strong El Ninos) away from crossing the very dangerous 1.5 C threshold that nations of the world recently pledged to attempt to avoid at the Paris Climate Summit. It’s also a number more than halfway toward hitting the catastrophic 2 C warming threshold. Perhaps more ominously, Monthly temperature departures in October of 2015 hit a range of 1.06 C above the 20th Century baseline and 1.28 C above 1880s averages — shorter term ranges that are already coming close to testing the 1.5 C threshold.
And just how much of a percentage of 1.5 C of the COP21's agreed-to global warming target is 1.28 C above 1880s levels is? About 85%. Forget waiting for peak oil, peak natural gas and peak coal to occur if we want to avoid catastrophic climate change and even more bizarre global weirding -- business as usual warped by fossil fuel extraction peaks and declines will still yield an atmospheric CO2 content of about 550 ppm (CO2e would be worse), yielding an ECS temperature rise of 3 C and an ESS rise of 6 C over the space of a thousand years. In geological time, that means Near Term Human Extinction.

We had a bit of trouble to find cisors and knifes so that everybody could work at the same (but eventually we had) and also to find laders and chairs in order for the smallest of us to actually reach the grapes!
When the grapes are all mashed up (thanks to the super machine!), they hang in there (or rather bathe) for 10 days. Until then they are still in the state of grape juice : it's called "Tsveni".
After those 10 days of rest, the juice is put into those huge bottles, for some more rest : so that pips, insects and everything that isn't drinkable goes to the bottom of the bottles. No filter used, it's natural filtration. Several bottles are used, and from the red color of the grapes we end up with a yellow colored wine.
Don't be afraid, the wine we drink is actually really clean (and really good, isn't it so Lekso?).
After the great work was finished, the sun came in just in time for "Supra" and Mtsvadi (barbecue).

It was really nice to seat all together, to share the great foods (potatoes bread, cheese, mtsvadi, chicken, katchapouri, apple cake,...) alongside with some live music (acoustic guitar by Lekso's uncle and Joe, and also a bit of piano!).

Possibly one of the rarest collections of autographs of all time, this styrofoam “gallery control” hat used by Tournament Marshal’s for golf tournaments, was signed by virtually every player in the field from the 1966 Tournament of Champions. This Tournament was held at the Desert Inn Country Club in Las Vegas, Nevada from April 14-17, 1966 with an 18 hole playoff taking place on Monday April 18, 1966 between Arnold Palmer and Gay Brewer. Palmer won the playoff. This hat is signed by many members of the World Golf Hall of Fame and multiple Major winning golfers cluding. Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus, Sam Snead, Gary Player, Billy Casper, Chi Chi Rodriguez, Ken Venturi, Gene Littler, Ray Floyd. “Champagne” Tony Lema, Doug Sanders, Phil Rodgers, Gay Brewer (lost in playoff that year to Palmer), Lionel Hebert, Mr. 59 Al Geiberger, George Archer, Bob Charles, Bruce Crampton, George Knudson, Joe Campbell, and others. This is a one of a kind keepsake. It was worn by a gentleman named Barney Baxter, who was a friend of a friend of my Grandfather, named Pug Pilcher (maker of the “PUG-UGLY” putters). Pug was like a second Grandfather to me and he gave me this hat that he had gotten from his friend Barney. I received it back in the mid 1980’s. I have kept it around ever since, moving it from place to place. I don’t have much time or room for golf memorabilia anymore with having a wife and 2 kids. I want to sell this to someone that will be able to display it proudly as it is very very rare with all of these signatures. Please send me an offer on the hat if you are interested.

My husband and I are huge fans of How to Train Your Dragon, and we have been playing it for a while now. However recently it hasn't been letting my husband log in (he loves his Zippleback, and it is his favorite dragon) and whenever I try to buy a Zippleback the game completely freezes and crashes.
I have tried in installing the game, it didn't work, I've checked the other dragons, it seems to only happen with the Zippleback. It doesn't give me an error code, it just crashes. I find it very frustrating and my husband loves flying around after he gets out of work. We normally play offline, and have spent more than I care to admit of real money for in-game purchases.
I would appreciate it if you could look into the matter. Thank you.
Hi, thank you for reporting this issue. When your husband tries to log in does he get an error message? What happens when he tries to log in? Regarding your issue, have you been charged for the Zippleback egg but not received it? Do you get any error messages when trying to purchase it? Could you please also let us know what platform you are using to play, and if this occurs in others platforms or devices? Do let us know. Thank you!
Thank you for the udpate. You mentioned reinstalling the PC downloadable did not help resolve the issue, correct? Is your phone IOS or android? If these does not occur across platforms it may be there is an issue with your device. Could you let us what kind of computer you are using to play the game as well as what OS you are running. Thank you!
Hello! Thank you for the udpate. This only occurs on the downloadable correct? Could you please provide us with the username and viking name. Do you remember what you were doing in game before this first occurred? Please also provide us with the username and viking name for your viking, as you are unable to purchase the Zippleback egg. Thank you!
When he tries to log in the game just freezes and crashes without any error message. We use my PC to play the game. when I go to purchase one from the store, it doesn't even load the animation for the dragon, I click it to buy one and the game just stops working and crashes, no error message. It seems to only happen on my computer and not my phone.

StarTech.com 4 Port DVI Video Splitter with Audio -Portmore to get its own market
Residents of Portmore can expect an agricultural market in the next administration of the municipal council.
Acting Mayor of Portmore Leon Thomas said at a STAR/JNN community forum in Portmore last night that the Portmore Municipal Council has made plans to build a market on a piece of land that has already been identified.
He said the facility will be located in Cedar Grove, across from the Caymanas Police Station.
President of the Sunshine City Chamber of Commerce, Norman Walker, said that the time has come for Portmore to have its own market.
“We think that Portmore is ready for a market,” Walker said at the townhall meeting held on the grounds of the HEART Trust/NTA last night.
“If we are going to have a business environment that is going to create employment then we need an environment that is conducive to business development,” Walker said in his opening address in front of the visibly divided crowd; one side donning green and the other orange.
The acting mayor of Portmore Leon Thomas, gave further details.
“What we have done so far is that we had three consultative meetings. We have met with the Local Government Ministry. We have done the plan and the design and we are now conducting a survey with Portmore citizens to get their views on the matter,” Thomas said.
The Portmore Municipal Council was formed in 2003 and is the only council without a market.
Meanwhile Thomas faced fiery questions about the short-comings of the Council, among them the is the question about containing mosquitoes.
When a resident asked about fogging throughout the municipality, Thomas said the responsibility is of the St Catherine Health department.
“It is not the responsibility of the municipal council to conduct fogging. However, the municipal council has purchased four fogger machines and gave them to the St Catherine Health department,” he said.
Jamaica Labour Party candidate Keith Blake and Thomas will vie for the mayor post in the November 28 Local Government elections.Student or Learner
The mage pointed to a two-story house of brick and timber behind a jig-jog brick wall with deep arches.
Wouldn't be possible to understand as jig-jog what in Architecture is known as "articulated"__An articulated wall, which I think is when bricks are in and out in a decorative way all along its surface.
I add the characteristics of the neighbourhood in which the house and the wall are:
the snobby neighborhood sported houses gaudy even by the citizens' standards. Mismatched towers, archways, curved staircases, hedged gardens, turrets, tricolor chimneys, false fronts, frescoes, balconies, and other ridiculous trappings decorated the block.

The Ultimate Guide To commercial painting termsIn 40 ABY, the Five Worlds government of the Corellian system assembled a decoy fleet of decommissioned and nearly derelict vessels, and brought it to a deep-space rendezvous point to conduct negotiations with the Galactic Alliance. Captain Hoclaw's Victory-class Star Destroyer Valorum served as the flagship of the fleet. The negotiations were a farce, however, as Five World Prime Minister Sadras Koyan was simply attempting to lure Alliance Chief of State Jacen Solo to the negotiation site in order to fire Centerpoint Station, an ancient superweapon that hung in the Corellian system, at Solo's flagship. A battle occurred between the decoy fleet and the Galactic Alliance Second Fleet, and Corellian reinforcements arrived to help. Centerpoint's repulsor weapon fired and destroyed the GA Second Fleet and the decoy fleet.

This week was pretty chill. We didn't have to many citas [appointments] and we didn't meet any new investigators so it was a little rough but were still working. Victor and Vilma, were able to go to a baptism this week of a girl in the ward though. And they said they were excited for their baptism. They are reading the Book of Mormon together and they also said that its bonita [beautiful], so i'm excited for that .
Today is exactly 6 months that I left on my mission. Its absolutely insane how fast itsd gone by, and even though is only been 6 months, I've still learned a ton about this Gospel and my testimonio is 50 times bigger than before i left. And i know that in the next 18 months i still have a lot more stuff to learn and I'm pumped to be able to do that.
Yesterday we had the opportunity to to visit a family in the ward that went through something really hard. The dad of this family was accused of robbing and beating someone in a park that he was never even been in and they put him in jail for a month and basically took away everything he had. This guy is like 60 years old and is literally the nicest person i have ever met. And after he got out of jail he couldn't do anything. He couldn't leave his house alone and he had to be in his house at 6pm or they put him back in jail. The cool thing about the visit that we had was that we were contacting and we knocked on their without knowing that they lived there. We shared a couple scriptures with them and they thanked us for everything and told us that that visit was exactly what they needed. Experiences like that are what make it exciting to be a missionary. That we can have such a big impact on people. Its super cool.
Anyway that's about it for this week. Love you all and hope you have a good week.
Elder Crisp12:43 p.m. | Updated Before a federal jury found him guilty on Monday, former State Senator Pedro Espada Jr. seemed to be channeling his inner Hugo Chávez.
Now it was Mr. Espada who, like Mr. Chávez, detected satanic forces.
For protection against “evil spiritual powers,” he went around the other day with a rosary-attached cross dangling prominently from his neck. Members of his entourage wore red, a color that they said was another way to ward off evil. If you next see Mr. Espada clutching a clove of garlic, you’ll know he suspects that vampires, too, are out to get him.
His Lucifer is the United States government, whose lawyers had a hard time convincing a jury in Brooklyn that the former senator — who might be referred to with greater precision as the thoroughly disgraced former senator — was the crook they said he was.
On Monday, on their 11th day of deliberations in the federal courthouse in Brooklyn, jurors pronounced him guilty on four counts of theft in the embezzlement case against him and his son, Pedro Gautier Espada. No verdict was reached, not yet anyway, against the son. The case turned on charges that the Espadas looted a nonprofit health care network to treat themselves to hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of high living, including sushi and lobster dinners, spa getaways and luxury cars.
For many days, the jurors seemed to be doing some channeling themselves: summoning their inner Gordon Gekko, the character in the film “Wall Street” best known for the line that “greed, for lack of a better word, is good.” In this case, it may well have been that some jurors believed that greed, if not good, was at least acceptable.
That Mr. Espada has an avaricious streak wider than the Cross Bronx Expressway is hard to dispute. The evidence of lavish spending is ample.
The tensions within the jury may have been about the Espadas’ claim to a right to have done whatever they wished with all that money, never mind that everyone else was left holding their noses. At the trial’s start in March, the former senator’s lawyer told jurors that her client “was entitled to spend the money in the way that he did.”
If Mr. Espada says he is bedeviled, think how federal prosecutors must have felt. They have had a rough time in several recent cases trying to convince juries to convict New York politicians charged with felonious possession of sticky fingers.
In December, a federal jury in Manhattan failed to reach a verdict in the corruption trial of City Councilman Larry B. Seabrook, who was accused of money laundering and extortion to enrich relatives, friends and himself. Mr. Seabrook may deserve to be forever known as Bagel Larry for a charge that he doctored a $7 receipt for a bagel sandwich and a soda so that he could get $177 back from a political club. He now faces a new trial. In the meantime, his City Council privileges to decide how public money is spent in his Bronx district have been revoked.
Then we have Assemblyman William F. Boyland Jr., acquitted last November by another federal jury in Manhattan of conspiring to take bribes from a health care group. Mr. Boyland was later brought up on a separate set of bribery charges.
The November verdict was a devilment of its own, because the head of the health care group had previously been convicted of conspiring to give those bribes. In other words, he offered payoffs to a man who, to go by the Boyland jurors’ logic, didn’t receive them. As long as we’re dabbling in religion and mysticism, we might as well call it the immaculate reception.
As for the elder Espada, everything about him — his outsized sense of entitlement, his flaunting of large sums spent on himself, his Chávez-like antics — should give former colleagues in Albany pause, be they his fellow Democrats or Republicans. They had once thought him worthy of leadership positions. No courtroom verdict was needed to figure out what it says about their own judgment.A Sri Lankan man, who successfully claimed refugee status in Canada after fleeing the country, is still waiting to become a full Canadian citizen because his case is snarled due to the changes in the Immigration Policy, the CBC News reported on Thursday. The 36-year-old man N.A.M.N. came to Vancouver during the war in Sri Lanka in 2008. His lawyer Doug Cannon has said the Lankan followed the rules when he made two return trips home, but now that Canada’s immigration laws have changed, he’s caught in a legal limbo. “He’s a law-abiding refugee who is now being told to get lost,” said. N.A.M.N. says that when the civil war was over three years later, he returned home twice to visit his ailing mother and then to get married. When he returned from his trip with his new wife, they dreamed of starting a family in Vancouver.
But in the meantime, changes to the law allowed officials to reopen asylum files. Cannon says the focus on pushing people out suggests “refugees really are just opportunists — or they are a constant burden on our society, and we should get rid of as many as we can. N.A.M.N. only learned he was being flagged for his earlier trips home after writing his citizenship tests in 2015 and awaiting word of the date for his swearing-in ceremony. Nilam’s wife, Fathima, 30, has obtained permanent residency status — but Nilam may now be deported, despite living in Vancouver, working as a taxi driver, paying taxes like a “model citizen,” says his lawyer. – See more at:Akshay Verma is a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine student at Michigan State University and a Research & Development Consultant.

I realize there's a lot of "buzzy" talk about blockchain. But blockchain isn't about technology at all. Rather, it's about new business models that fundamentally change how business will be done. As Emily Becher, SVP AT Samsung NEXT International, explains: "Blockchain is a distribution of trust that can shift the distribution of power …."
Don't be put off by the geek-speak. Blockchain represents the biggest new revenue opportunity for agencies since 2005, before the industry was taken over by a few big ad networks, black box platforms and fraud. In 2005, ad tech was approached with a "wait and see attitude" because agencies didn't see the business model. Ten years later, the business model is clear and agencies took the biggest hit.
In a reversal of fortune, instead of technology creating more opacity as usual, blockchain is the technology of trust agencies need to protect and act on their clients' best behalf. What's disruptive about blockchain for agencies is that it powers a new and vital "trust" role for agencies, ensuring the quality of the entire advertising supply, heretofore impossible for agencies to execute.
With blockchain, "trust" can become a monetizable asset for agencies three ways.
1. Blockchain allows agencies to diversify campaigns efficiently by breaking the lock of the big ad duopoly.
Facebook and Google capture 70% of all U.S. ad dollars because, for agencies, these platforms scale easily. Yet this concentration of so many ad dollars into so few outlets puts agencies and their advertisers at a huge disadvantage, with little control over campaign execution. Blockchain solves this problem because it decentralizes "transactional" control, so that agencies can efficiently deal directly with many digital outlets, like local media, to improve the quality of campaigns. In this new environment, savvy agencies can create engaging user experiences organized around verified audiences who are engaged on specific topics in real time.
2. Blockchain eliminates the need for "black box middlemen" who bleed ad budgets (and results) for advertisers.
Blockchain aims its "decentralization arrow" at the heart of ad tech middlemen (ad networks, exchanges and SaaS platforms) because its distributed ledger architecture is a trusted framework with which parties can directly interact. No need for "transaction arbitrators" or external SaaS players, all of who saw spectacular financial growth at the direct expense of advertiser results, due to an erosion of active media dollars.
3. Blockchain breaks the financial influence tech firms have on marketing.
Let's face it. Technologists drove ad tech to suit the needs of investors first and marketers second, which is why we are left with a complex, dysfunctional landscape of epic proportions. Right now, blockchain is being largely left to the technologists, who have a propensity to solve technical problems in complex ways. For instance, one blockchain venture plans to run 100,000 simultaneous blockchains to overcome the severe blockchain transaction limit of 7-10 per minute. This approach may be imaginative, but its complexity is daunting, covering issues as diverse as energy management (blockchain consumes crazy amounts of energy) to latency issues. Yet this is what is getting funded. The nascent blockchain business is being shaped by technologists, not agencies, and that could mean agencies will miss a new revenue opportunity, one they haven't seen in over a decade and are unlikely to see again for another decade.
The most important change agencies need right now is a change of attitude. Blockchain can disproportionately allow agencies to save the industry, as they save themselves. If agencies had 2005 to do again -- I bet a lot would be different. It's a "back to the future" moment when Dr. Brown declares: "If my calculations are correct … you gonna see some serious shit," and for the disruptive agencies, this is gonna be awesome.Supernatural season 7 episode 23 mkv download

Today, I went to check on the animals at Lake Murray, as usual, and I thought I heard a falcon calling. Then, I saw something that looked like a juvenile falcon, but wasn't sure. A few minutes later, I see a vulture flying around and right after that, an adult falcon chases him off. I went over to try to get the falcon's photo, stepping through a bunch of coot parts and a bad a smelly area. But, he flew off and attacked some ducks across the lake. Luckily, the ducks saw him and got a good head start. However he, and the other bird, were very persistent. At one point, I saw something hit the water, but I think it was a ruddy duck or coot taking a dive. As far as I know, no one was hurt and I didn't see the falcons again (or get a picture).
Right under where the falcons were hanging out were about 15 ducks including Quacker, Peaches and her mates and daughters and some ducks that Project Wildlife released earlier this year. Here is one of the ducks that almost became a victim:
I also saw, in the same area, some eared grebes, but far off:

Can you please tell me that i have to create framework for each and every new project or can we use old framework which we have create for other project?
HI,
It depends project to projects for an example in E-Commerce project your component of Frameworks are re usable because all the E-Commerce applications have almost same application flow.
Excel Utilities and other Utilities can be used again and again in every project with little project specific changes.
Page Object Model structure can be re-used with changing the page objects. Framework is nothing but the idea of implementiing things in a logical and effective way and that can be remain same in your projects, for another example reporting structure, logging structure.
But there are many things which differ project to project like page elements, application flow, testing needs and those has to be cater differently.

My mom grew up there. My dad discovered and fell in love with it, finding it far superior to the Harlem railroad flats of his youth. They married at the time Hitler was perfecting his blitzkrieg. I arrived at the peak of the Führer’s success.
The war in Europe scooped up my father and took him out of our life while he was still just a blur to me. He was gone for two years and returned as a large, semi-stranger from a far-off land whose presence filled the bungalow and wedged uncomfortably between my mom and me.
Spitting distance from our house was a little brown-sand beach. In the summer time, if the tide was high and the day warm, I went swimming with Mom and Dad in the tepid and semi-polluted saltwater. After splashing around in the languid seaweed, baking under the hot sun, we all went back into the little house and showered to rid ourselves of the salt and god knows what else. The house had a cubicle of a bathroom, subway-tiled walls, tiny hex-tiled floor, a toilet, sink and, of course, an enamelled, iron bathtub, which was to play a major role in my young life.
I loved my mom. She was very beautiful. Even as a toddler I knew this as I hugged my arm ‘round her leg, rested my cheek against her smooth thigh and looked upward at the delightful rest of her. After swimming, she took me into the shower with her and rinsed me off. I loved it—the intimacy of our bathing together, the warm water, my wonderful young mom with the golden blond hair standing over me naked. I watched her rinsing the salt from her hair, the water flowing over the pure white skin, which her bathing suit hid from the sun and the calm tan the sun’s rays had lavished upon her glistening legs. Her sweet image mesmerized me. It was a period of calm life, a good time for a sprout to grow.
There it is. A memory. An artefact to hoard and cherish. Not to be launched into the attic dust but carefully stored within the mind as experience. We all hoard experiences. You really cannot throw them away, even if desperate to do so. You’d have to throw yourself away. And of course, that’s been done, many times over, always with the same, sad ending.

I love cooking (if I’m not forced to). I usually try to cook at least one meal a day, but it’s tough with school and homework and such things. Sundays are my day off… well sort of. I actually play catch up for all the homework I didn’t do on Saturday. But never the less, I end up cooking on Sunday.
Today I made crepes for breakfast. Mmm. A few weeks ago (when it first started getting cold out) I made the most delicious pumpkin butter to go with the crepes, or bread, etc.
For lunch, well you see what I made… Vegetarian sandwiches choc-full of veggies. Mmm. Fresh and delish. I bought some Tuscan bread, dill, onions, tomatoes, carrots, cucumbers and cream cheese. I chopped up the dill very finely and mixed it into the cream cheese and just sliced up the rest of the veggies.
As you can see, my boyfriend made this garden veggie sandwich into an open face creation.
I plan to make schnitzel and (eastern european style) potato salad for dinner. 🙂 I have some hints to share when it comes to making schnitzel, but you’ll have to wait until later to read about it.A hot car can be remedied quickly by using the modern marvel of air conditioning, but is it more fuel efficient to roll the windows down instead? The answer to this question depends on the speed of your car. We have collected the following advice for drivers who want to cool down their car and save on gas.
When the car is already cool, the air conditioner doesn’t have to work as hard. Car temperatures can quickly rise to over 140 degrees on a hot day. Parking in the shade or in a garage can help reduce the workload placed on the air conditioner. Window shades placed on the inside of the windshield can also help to deflect the sun’s rays. If a car is hot before it is time to go, drivers should open their doors to let the hot air out before cranking up the air conditioning.
When considering whether to ride with the windows down or the air conditioning on, the speed of the car will determine the savings on fuel. A car traveling as speeds over 40 miles-per-hour meets a fair amount of resistance, or drag, from the air moving around it. Like a parachute opening, the drag is increased when the windows of the car are rolled down. More resistance means the car has to work harder to get down the road. In these instances, it is better to ride with the windows up and the air conditioning on.Here is a scenario. You have a product or service that you want to advertise to the world by launching its website. Or you simply want to have your say through an online blog. In such a case, the very first question you ask yourself is, how to make a free website that encompasses all the features that you need and all the attributes your readers or visitors will be looking for.
One of the best ways to create a website in today’s world is through an online website builder. Especially for the novice in the field, a website builder takes much of the hassle and expenditure of time and money from the process of creating a website. But, the story doesn’t stop just here. The Internet is inundated with so many website builders that may or may not come up to your expectations.
So in this post, I would highlight all the aspects that one should look for while choosing a website builder. This write up is especially aimed at beginners who want to teach themselves a lesson or two about online website builders and their specific features.
1. How much will it cost you?
Price is the very first point of concern for almost every potential website creator. I think that it is quite reasonable to look for the price because if a website builder charges you the same as professional development and design services, then what’s the point of going for a website builder in the first place?
Different website builder have different price options, and there may be a few that offer free website creation. However, remember that it’s just a cliché that if something is pricy, it better be good too. I have seen some paid website builders that mess up with your website creation project, and I have also seen some free ones that offer Html5 website templates and a bundle of features for creating a stunning website.
All in all, I would recommend to go for a free website builder for the very first version of your website till you test the waters or get used to the whole concept. Once you know your niche and the features that are important for your kind of business, try the paid website building service for more professional or heavy-duty website.
2. What are the possibilities of modification and customization?
The biggest disadvantage of creating websites through a website builder is that they would all look quite similar to each other. Most website builders offer a set pattern or ‘formula webs design’ to its users. Even in that situation, however, there is one thing that can turn the tables for your website and make it stand out, and that is the possibility of customization.
If a website builder offers merely the option of content replacement, colors and fonts editing – take it immediately off your like, I repeat, abort! Give it up! A good builder should offer advanced options like custom background settings, a wide range of fonts to pick from, editing spacing and margins or editing the entire page design, etc. It should also allow you to preview the changes you make, which helps to avoid a number of mistakes and save your time.
3. Is it search engine optimized?
Creating a website is just half the story, promoting it online covers the second half. To get much visitors and traffic on your website, it’s important for it to be search engine optimized. It gives you a push to get your site higher in search engines and help you beat your competitors. A website that is SEO optimized facilitates your communication with users, builds your brand awareness, and above all, it enables potential users to find you on the web easily.
When you start making your website with the help of a website builder, you should check if the website they create is optimized for the search engine. There are a lot of website building services that provide features like adding keywords, meta tags, meta descriptions, activate Google Analytics and Google Webmaster Tools for your site, as well as generate a sitemap in the websites they create.
If you don’t have an extra budget for professional SEO services, the SEO feature offered by your website builder may be enough for you to at least to get started with your online presence.
Do they create responsive websites?
This is the era of multiple digital devices. Therefore, it is important for your website to be responsive in order to look good on all the devices. Especially for mobile screens, your website needs to be responsive in order to cater to all kinds of users.
If your website builder does not provide ‘completely’ responsive website, then at least it should be available for desktop and mobile phones. But I would recommend you to look for a builder that makes everything work, i.e. customize your desktop design to mobile automatically.
Conclusion
To choose the most suitable website builder is not a difficult task and even the beginners in the field can do it themselves. You just need to see which things to look for and what can be the deal breakers, and hopefully this article will help you do just that.The newest members of the Topeka Zoo, three, female, Sumatran tiger cubs, are growing right on track according to a news release from the City of Topeka on Tuesday.
“They are amazing,” Animal Care Supervisor Shanna Simpson said. “They are so active and playful and very vocal now. All three are chuffing regularly”
The three cubs, born on May 4, 2014, are all now weighing in at just more than 13 pounds. Jingga, the mother of the three cubs, continues to provide all the care the cubs need. Zoo staff continue to keep a close eye on the developmental progress the cubs are making through video evaluation and morning weight checks while Jingga stretches her legs outside.
The Zoo says the cubs are still on track to make their public debut around the first week of August.SMAN Coal Feeder Breakers ., coke, salt, gypsum, potash and other friable minerals. Feeder-Breakers are designed with an electro-mechanical breaker drive, utilizing a torque control coupling.

apple tree quilt block. Their question was "What's your favorite way to eat apples?" It reminded me of my mother's wonderful apple crisp recipe, so I thought I'd share that on the blog today.
I often take a pint canning jar (or equivalent) and layer the dry ingredients inside. The college kids absolutely love to receive them as gifts. All they have to add is a stick of margarine and 5 pared/sliced apples to have a great tasting and easy treat! (Especially great warm and with ice cream)
Grandma Seifert's Apple Crisp
5 medium apples, peeled, cored and thinly sliced
3/4 cup quick oats
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup granulated sugar
1/2 cup flour
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 cup margarine (1 stick)
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease an 8x8 baking pan. Arrange apples in the bottom of the pan. In a bowl, combine all dry ingredients. Cut in margarine with a pastry blender until crumbly. Pour on top of apples and pat down. Bake at 350 degrees for 45 minutes.
tips: Softer apples bake quicker, crisp apples need a longer baking time. Mixing varieties is OK. Older or drier apples can be tossed with a little connamon sugar or lemon juice to draw out their juices before arranging them in the pan.
Mother used to peel the apples and cut slices off of them while holding them in her hand. Don't know how she avoided cutting herself doing that! The system I use to prepare the apples is:
1. peel apple with a potato/vegetable peeler
2. cut in half stem to bottom
3. scoop out seeds/core with a melon baller
4. cut a V with a paring knife to remove blossom end and stem
5. place apple cut side down on a cutting board and slice down into slices 1/8 to 1/4 inch widePricesLayout

As in Venice, bridges here link a number of small islands, which are dotted with houses that once were, and still largely are, workmen's cottages. Many of them line the Fondamenta dei Vetrai, the canalside walkway leading from the Colonna vaporetto landing. To avoid being pressured to buy glass, take the regular vaporetto from Piazzale Roma or the Fondamente Nuove to Murano instead of succumbing to the hawkers offering you a "free" trip to Murano. They will take you to inferior glassmakers and will abandon you if you don't buy. If you do buy, rest assured that your taxi driver's commission will be added into the price you pay. Once on the island "guides" herd new arrivals to factories, but you can avoid the hustle by just walking away.
Be aware that some of the glass sold as "Murano" is made in China or Eastern Europe. Even if a piece is, in fact, made on Murano, its origin does not ensure either its quality or status as a good investment. If you are concerned with these issues, stick to pieces by those glassmakers with established reputations, most of whom have pieces displayed in the Murano Glass Museum or quality boutiques in and around Piazza San Marco.

If you missed the 2nd annual AMP Birthday Bash, don’t worry, we’ve got you covered! Especially when it comes to all things MKTO.
Let’s get you started with a quick background on Tony and Malcom: 10 Things You Didn’t Know About MKTO.
Up next, a review of AMP Birthday Bash, done by you – the listeners: AMP’s 2nd Annual Birthday Bash Reviewed By YOU!
Now, let’s get to the good stuff!
Vanessa is one lucky girl! She got to chat with MKTO backstage at the 2nd annual AMP Birthday Bash, where she confirmed that the boys are just as dreamy in person as they are on TV.
She started off the interview by praising the boys on how good they smell and on their Boston-centric style. Unfortunately we couldn’t capture their smell, but we’ve got plenty of pictures of the guys for you to check out here.
Did you know that MKTO loves Boston? When Vanessa asked them if they had been to Boston before, they said they’ve been here a couple times and Tony continued with, “It’s always good to just be able to go see Boston which has so much history and it’s beautiful, but also being able to play a show in a beautiful stadium like this [Gillette].”
The boys are stoked to be coming back to Boston on August 6th for The American Dream Tour, so Malcom can try pizza burgers and the boys can go on their first duck tour.
You can get your tickets for their show at the Paradise Rock Club here.
Did we mention that Vanessa convinced the boys that a duck tour involves swimming? Watch the video to see what she said, and for more details on their new single, “Classic”!

The small town, with its 6 000 inhabitants, straddles the N8 between Groblershoop and Kimberley in the Northern Cape.
SANRAL Project Manager, Imelda Julies, said the plan was to make the road more pedestrian friendly. With the help of the community and the town council, it was agreed that the N8 (which carries a large amount of heavy-vehicle traffic) should be made safer, so that it can cater for vulnerable road users such as children, the elderly and people with disabilities.
Julies said a concept plan has been accepted and the project is in the design phase.
“This phase will include consultation with the local town council and members of the community. Once the process has been completed, we will move to construction.”
Gideon Witbooi, a resident of Griekwastad, who has been a foreman at the Siyancuma Local Municipality for 42 years, said he was particularly excited about the agency’s plans to improve the pedestrian infrastructure in town.
Witbooi said that trucks often speed through the town with no regard for pedestrians or other traffic.
“Also, when it rains, storm water runs everywhere. We are very pleased with SANRAL’s plans and are looking forward to seeing the improvements,” he said.
There are businesses situated along both sides of the N8 and any upgrades for pedestrians would also include parking spaces for vehicles visiting the businesses.
Julies said: “Included in the proposal is the upgrading of the sidewalks, high visibility signs, safe pedestrian crossings, parking spaces and the upgrading of the storm water drainage in the town.”The Sentinel Echo reported on the tragic and preventable death of Dorothy McKnight. McKnight was a resident of Laurel Village. The facility failed to supervise her and allowed her to leave the premises during frigid winter temperatures on Jan. 18. Laurel County Coroner Doug Bowling said after the incident that McKnight was “not dressed for the weather” that measured only 6 degrees above 0 the previous night and morning. She died from exposure.
A lawsuit was filed May 31 by Joseph McKnight, who was appointed executor of the estate of Dorothy McKnight following her death on Jan. 18. The lawsuit claims that employees at the elderly housing complex were negligent in supervising the 95-year-old woman who is described in the lawsuit as “an adult with physical and mental disabilities.”
That alleged negligence includes claims that the staff at Laurel Village “failed to adequately assess, assist, care for, supervise and monitor” McKnight’s activities; did not follow its own policies and did not provide adequate staff and adequately trained staff. It also states the nursing facility did not conduct timely checks on the residents and did not implement a care plan for McKnight.
“As a result of the Defendant’s negligence, Dorothy McKnight eloped from the premises, was injured and died,” the document reads. “As a result of Dorothy McKnight’s injuries she suffered physical pain and mental anguish until the time of her death….her estate has incurred funeral and burial expenses.”10 Facts about Chernobyl Nuclear Disaster

Earlier this month, we had an opportunity to pitch at the Test Track event for TRAFFIC Vancouver. This was our first public ‘hello world’ as we start down a process that is sure to be a wild ride. As part of this, we built a website for our brand and slapped up a “Beta” next to the logo, after all… we were truly in Beta.
This gave us a chance to reminisce to four years ago when a few of our principles were involved in another startup and we labeled the initial release as”First Draft”, arguing that “Beta” in the world of Web 2.0 software often implied a product that was, “entirely workable, defect free, and a good option for all that ails them.”
Here is an excerpt from the blog post that was writte for that launch, as come to think of it, a lot of what we have done so far definitely falls into the whole concept of “first draft” as well.
Unfortunately, people (thanks in large part to Google and the whole Web 2.0 phenomenon/bubble) expect that when you see Beta next to a product, it is entirely workable, defect free, and a good option for all that ails them. Heck, even Microsoft is charging for their Beta.
Our justification for naming is just this. Think back to writing those college/university papers when you first put all your thoughts down on paper. Sometimes you get it right the very first time and your prose are perfect, and with a few edits here and there … whammo – you submit an A+ paper. But the reality for most of us isn’t like that. You put your first draft together with an underlying genesis of an idea at the core, cobbled together with bits and pieces of stories you read, the odd plagiarized copy here and there [legal note: this is a reference to using Google’s API, not an Apple/Creative thing], and paragraphs that sound good, but you know they are not in the final order. If it is a thesis, you may even have a committee who reviews your first draft and offers you feedback on how to improve, change, modify, etc. You may even get steered down an entirely different path by the feedback you receive. And that is why it is Calgoo First Draft.
And like the term paper, we gave ourselves a deadline. Otherwise, products are never released, and they will never be more than 90% done. So if you want to label it, you can call it version 1.0 if you must. But we ask this of you, don’t grade us yet. This is just the beginning.
So like then as is now… this is just the beginning.More Entries

Fantastic Latino Girl Face And Playing Cards TattooI mentioned earlier on the blog that we had all taken on some projects during our break from publishing HBM. For me, this meant working a little on video game writing ideas and a little on nothing at all. Then, Duane, Vincent, and I decided to write a truly collaborative piece. For those who don't know, Issue 3 of Here Be Monsters (called "Where Cities Tread") was made up of three stories that were all set in the same world. We'd designed the concept together, but each story was still written by the author on his own. During the summer though, we started on a story that was actually written by all three of us.
To do this, we used Google Docs. It allowed us to write on the same page at once, comment on eachother's writing, all while chatting from our computers at our separate houses. I'd known about the tool before this, but to see it in action was pretty incredible. During our first session, we were brainstorming all kinds of ideas. Characters, themes, rules about the story, publication plans, everything was pouring out faster than we could have done around a kitchen table (our usual meeting room).
There was even some healthy debate going on about ethics, religion in fiction, all sorts of things. And, keep in mind, this is with 3 passionate writers, so the fact that we were able to keep it to "healthy debate" is a testament to how well we get along and work together.
The plot was slower to come together than some of the other parts, but we had enough to start with. So, each of us began writing from a separate point in the story. I was doing a scene between two characters, going back and forth, when I got stuck. I wrote "I'm stuck" on the screen just so that the guys knew why I'd stopped, and then the amazing thing happened. Vincent picked up right from where I'd left off and continued the scene. He stayed true to everything I'd written so far but brought the story forward in a way I wasn't expecting. And I was totally on-board with it.
For those of you who are writers, or even other artists, you can probably imagine how scary it could be to work together in this way. You see all of eachother's mistakes before they can be corrected, you're required to buy in to other people's ideas and hope they buy into yours -- But this worked. Really really well. We all ended up tagging in and out like this as we formed the first few scenes of the story. It was so exciting.
Sadly, the project did get put on hold, but that's okay. It led us back to Here Be Monsters and a new issue. Also, it proved that we could do it. I don't doubt that we'll pick it up again. Whether it will end up as an HBM publication of some kind, I don't know, but it was too fun to not follow through on.

Years later, many women despise the question, “So what do you do?” and find it feels degrading to say, “I’m a homemaker”.
One can only conclude that “homemaker” feels like a degrading profession because our culture mostly has a degrading view of home. Do we even realize that’s the logical reality? Do we even know how low a value we have placed on the home? And why can’t we make the connections between so many of our societal ills and the moving away from the value of home?
When home was valued, and therefore women were proud to be “homemakers”, what did the home look like? More importantly, what should it look like now?
Helper Wife
A proper, biblical view of marriage understands that a wife delights to help her husband. It is not a degrading position. We all help people, no matter what profession we’re in. An attorney helps his clients; a teacher helps her students and principal; employees all seek to help their employers. But talk of “helping a husband” is not a favorite topic. A godly wife, however, sees her position as her husband’s helper a privilege and she knows that obedience to her Lord means obedience to her role. Does she manage her home so that “he safely trusts her”? Can he concentrate on his role as provider knowing that his “teammate” is doing her part to make the family run smoothly? Does he know that she is giving herself the task of training their children to grow up with the skills they need?
Mother
Perhaps the most challenging and engaging role of a home-maker is shaping the little ones in her home. It helps me to step back from time to time, look at that 4-year-old and envision a grown woman. Am I investing in her life, her time, her very soul? The next generation is the one in whom we invest or neglect. Either way, the responsibility falls on us. Do we comprehend the import of our role to train their characters, to teach them of God and to prepare them for all of life? Could there be anything more worthy of our time and energy?
Friend
Women of yesteryear had time to invest in the lives of other women. Younger mothers, widows, family members–she made herself available for reaching out to the needs of others. Could it be that the declining state of women’s mental health could be due in part to the lack of community and support women once received from each other?
A few of her jobs
Besides her titles, her jobs are numerous and powerful. Over the years, less value has been placed on seemingly unimportant things that make a home, but there are profound implications for the empty homes their neglect has created. Just a few…
- Ministering to family and guests through meals around a family table where people look at each other, discuss life, and connect each day.
- Creating an atmosphere of serenity. A homemaker adds her own touch through music, candles, flowers, decorating or maybe just her smile. In a day of clamor and chaos, a safe, peaceful place in which a family can seek harbor is a rare treasure.
- Peace through “being there”. Ask a child what he most needs and if he is able, he’ll answer “time”. Is she there when he needs to ask a question? When he has an injury? When he is sad and needs a lap? A hug? Or, is she simple there–like a soothing balm of reassurance, even when he’s in the other room? There is no one that takes a mother’s place in creating this constant “being there” peace in her child’s life.
- Offering her gifts and services to those in need. Our lack of availability has created the need for a “nanny state” to care for so many needs that once the women of the community and churches cared for.
In a society where homemaking has become little more than a 50’s icon, perhaps through our zeal we can demonstrate to those around us the joy and privilege of making home. And just maybe, women will begin to “make it back home”!

oh, i love this!
I loved this post! I am a “homemaker” and feel quite blessed to be able to be a full time homemaker. I do the same thing with both my girls and the reaction is the same as you “she is going to be a woman someday! Am I giving her good, solid, biblical preparation?”
Good post – thanks!
Amen Kelly,
I’m going to share this with my friends. Thank you for a wonderful post.
Blessings
Awesome post and a great way to start my week!! 🙂
I LOVE this post! Thank you! Yes indeed, a great way to start the week!
It is incredible that we were just discussing the 31st chapter of Proverbs yesterday in Sunday school and then today I read this posting from you. Was that your inspiration?
Thanks so much for sharing such a great post. Though I don’t find that people see my role as a homemaker as less. Most, including women seem to automatically attribute the role as a homemaker as a huge responsibility and I suppose it is the maternal feminist in me that keeps my head held high that I am doing what God would have me do. “In the early years, a child’s needs to be with his mother is as intense as his need for food.” LLLI.
Yes, I think one of the most important ways to argue for homemaking today is to talk about children, especially young children. Someone has to watch them. Having worked in daycares, I know firsthand that is not the ideal setting! And why would you pay someone else to have more time and influence over your children than you do during the week? If it’s at all possible, I think it’s wonderful for the mother to be the one to stay home with her children. My mom did, and I felt exactly that peace and security you described having her always near.
Thank you for this post! I am going to share this on my facebook page for my friends and family to read. It is such a blessing to know others share my believe in what a home should be & what a mother should be.
also tricky to find the time while homemaking to strengthen and support younger moms in their roles, yet, I think we’re supposed to try to do this…
What a wonderful post! And so true!!!! God have given us an amazing gift in our role as homemakers…and any gift given to us by God is never something to be ashamed of even when society may not always understand it. 🙂
Oh this is truly a wonderful post! I am NEVER disappointed when I read all your new posts. Thanks for sharing this! I will of course be passing this along to everyone I know! 🙂 Thanks!!
Thank you for such a wonderful post! I love reading things that affirm our decision for me to be a homemaker. I just wish our finances would release the guilt from me to make additional income. I really do think we need a calling “back to home.” We definitely live is a society where it is not readily accepted, especially to be “raising homemakers.”
I really enjoyed this post! So true that our society doesn’t value the home any longer. And what a tragedy it has brought with it! It is such a blessing to stay at home with your children. My heart breaks when women don’t see it that way. Thanks for the inspiration.
what a great post. very incouraging. thanks!
I really enjoyed this post. I even mentioned it in one of my blog posts. Thanks!

The treemission project started as a collaboration between Rotary and the National Trust of Australia (WA) and Carbon Neutral in 2008. The concept is to encourage people to make a commitment to address climate change.
Through treemission, emissions accrued in everyday activities can be turned into trees and shrubs. This will not only help lower carbon levels in our atmosphere but also conserve endangered plants, animals and rehabilitate degraded land.
The initiative sets up a system to make tax deductible donations to offset carbon emissions from meetings and daily activities. These donations will enable an area of land to be planted and rehabilitated and a covenant placed over the site preventing removal of the trees for 100 years.
An exciting part of the project is that where possible locally endemic species will be used, and tree and under-storey species will be chosen for reasons of biodiversity.Foreign Minister Laila Freivalds Resigns
Sweden’s Foreign Minister Laila Freivalds resigned Tuesday after accusations that she acted unconstitutionally, and lied about knowing one of her aides was involved in shutting down a controversial far right website that posted cartoons depicting the prophet Mohammed.

This is not the first time Laila Freivalds has come under fire, as Judi Milar tells us:
The resignation comes with less than six months to the next general elections, with the ruling Social Democrats trailing in the polls.Marmot Folk,
Not long ago, with the help of Candice and Douglas Brooks, I posted a text and video overview of the fall conditioning program for SBA's alpine and free-ride skiers. As I put together the YouTube movie, I was struck then by how much fun the kids were having on the new high performance Indo Rowers, Real Ryders, Sliders, BOSU Domes and Balls in the SBA Performance Training Center.
Despite the challenging nature of our conditioning program, there were big smiles on the faces of our student-athletes and they were obviously having great fun (in particular Critter and Schrage), thanks in large part to their own enthusiasm and to the positive energy of all the people who have the good fortune to work in a coaching/conditioning capacity with our student-athletes. They thrive on it.
I turn now to another ski-racing group on the SBA campus that knows how to have a lot of fun while they're conditioning. The "Nordies" are the fastest-growing group on the SBA campus. Under Head Nordic Coach Jeff Schloss, SBA's Nordic student-athlete presence has more than doubled in just a year's time. Call it a cult of positive personality, great coaching, or both, but he and coach Ambrose Tuscano clearly have a great thing going.
As I put together the movie on the Nordic team's summer and fall conditioning program (also embedded below the blog post), I was struck, again, by the fun that these student-athletes were having and by the practically incomparable beauty of the terrain they typically cover on their late summer and early fall conditioning hikes, bikes, runs and skis.
Beauty can be found anywhere if you look hard enough, but, where we live and work, no search is necessary.
It is everywhere.
"Our sport is great for enjoying the natural aspects of Truckee because we don't have to stay on the trails," said SBA student-athlete and Nordic ski racer Kelly Habibi.
"We can go off the trail and enjoy some of the untouched country rather than the developed areas."
"Your settings can be taken for granted in your daily lives. When you're out training in Royal Gorge or on the back-country trip we took from the Boreal vicinity to the top of a peak, gaining 2,000 feet and down into Tahoe-Donner, you get back into appreciating your setting."
I asked Coach Jeff - "Jefe," as he is known - for an overview of the fall Nordic conditioning program. This is what he wrote:
The fall is an extremely important training time for Nordic Skiers. To succeed in Nordic racing an athlete has to have a very well developed aerobic capacity and there is only one way to achieve that: lots, and lots of endurance training.
In order to maximize on-snow performance SBA nordic skiers train year round, day after day, averaging about 10 hours a week of training in the summer months and building to about 16-20 hours a week in the fall. For the fall we used a three-week cycle where we concentrate on high intensity training in week 1, high volume training in week 2, and lower volume (recovery) in week three. Every week would have hard intervals, strength training, speed training, and lots and lots of endurance training.
Because we train so much it is important to have a lot of variety in the activities we do to keep it fresh. The most specific training we can do in the dry-land season is rollerskiing, and we rollerskied up old highway 40 a couple of times every week. We also did a lot of running including four high school XC running races in which SBA athletes had several top finishes including the SBA girls team going 1,2,3 at the Truckee Invitational in September. So we did lots of rollerskiing, lots of running, but also added some road and mountain biking, some awesome long hikes, some rock climbing, and some quality time in the SBA athletic training performance gym.
How do we know if all of this training is working? Every other week we do a time trial either rollerskiing or running and every SBA Nordic athlete has lowered their times substantially over the fall. Yes, we are getting fit!
We have been lucky to have been on snow starting on November 9th which is a great early start. Sophomore Alec Wiltz says “It is really great to be back on snow and I feel my technique and fitness have improved ten-fold since this time last year.”
Next up for a lot of the team is a trip to West Yellowstone.
The conditioning never ends, but, says Habibi, neither does the Nordic fun.
"We're a funky group, but when we're all together it's a good time."
Thanks to Coaches Jeff and Ambrose for all their help putting this post together. Ambrose supplied the video clips and a lot of the stills that you see in the movie, available at.
Be well,
Marmot ManWednesday, December 5, 2012
The Calm Before the Storm
After the flurry of assignments, tests and journals for the past week, today was mostly uneventful. I arrived home early, (6.30pm) and frankly, I'm blank. I have nothing to do. It was like the calm before the storm.
Starting tomorrow, the storm will come in the form of theater public performance, finals and college applications. Starting tomorrow, my life will be so busy that I won't have time to blog. Starting tomorrow, stress level will be high, sleep hours will be low and eye bags would be imminent. Such suffering that would befall me throughout next week.
But for what?
Yes, for what? Sometimes, we are flooded with information and to-do-lists that we lose sight of the very zenith we targeted. We dwell more on the stones along our way that we stray off our original path. That's human. But at times like this, we should reflect back our goals and priorities.
Hence, the calm before the storm.
It's like God really wanted me to reflect myself. Before I'm attacked by the stones of my journey and stray off, He wanted me to look forward and see if I'm on the right track.
So, am I?I was reminded this week that cooking is more an art than a science. I was making this mushroom omelette using a Donna Hay recipe online. It turned out very nice looking and it tasted great. But it was totally stuck to the pan. How frustrating.
The omelette was finished in the oven, as per the recipe. For this reason, you can't use a non-stick pan or any pan with a plastic handle. I don't own a cast iron pan, just the stainless steel one you see pictured. It's actually a great quality wedding gift with copper in the base, etc, etc. But sadly, there's no use touting its quality when half the egg is falling out of the pan in large, jagged bits and the rest is still stuck inside. Sigh.
I used a bit more oil than the recipe called for because I was worried this might happen. I guess that was not the answer, at least not this time. While I believe baking to be a science, cooking is more an art, and this tasty, but flawed, omelette proves it for me. Maybe it was my timing of the different parts of the recipe, or the heat of the stove, or the humidity in the kitchen, or anything else including the freshness of the eggs, the moisture of the mushrooms, and my mood. Who knows? I certainly don't.
On the positive side, this is a fantastic flavour combination. The shiitake mushrooms form the base for several other Asian tastes: ginger, sesame oil, red chilli, and scallions (green onions). Please try it out and tell me if it slides out of the pan for you. As for me, the next time I make it I'm going to use my non-stick pan and cook it fully on the stove with a lid to help things along.
This dish is part of our Wednesdays with Donna Hay blogging group. If you want to join us, next week we are making baba ghanoush from Modern Classics 1. Visit the others in my blogging group to see if they liked the recipe: Margaret from Tea and Scones, Kayte from Grandma's Kitchen Table, Gaye from Laws of the Kitchen, and Chaya from Bizzy Bakes.

- 3 VisitorsOur first full day at Disney. After a quick breakfast, we walked down to the Boardwalk and grabbed a boat to Hollywood Studios. The weather was overcast but warm enough to wear shorts with sweaters.
The place was buzzing as we walked up to the front gate. Jeremy and Corbin were excited. Tina and I noticed a lot of groups of Brazil. Like everywhere. We walked over to the Tower of Terror ride. Corbin didn't want to go on it, but I did manage to talk Tina into going.
Like all Disney rides, the waiting line is broken up into section. First, you get herded into a room where Rod Sterling appears on TV, telling you what happened at the Hollywood Tower Hotel. Then you end up in the basement. Next, you are guided to a number on the floor in front of the elevator doors. The doors open and you take your seat, buckle in and wait in anticipation. The ride moves up and you are treated to some more Disney theatre.
All of a sudden the 'car' moves forward and then into a completely dark room. Oh oh. Then the car drops. And I mean it drops. Then it goes back up. It drops. Up. Drops. I swear that on one drop the hang time was at least 5 or so seconds. Tina was screaming. That was a great ride. Exiting the ride, there was a boutique that had your picture. And there was Tina and I in our glory - me with my eyes closed (or looking away from the camera) and Tina with one of the best terrified looks ever. So we had to get the picture.
Corbin and I walked over to the Rock and Roll Roller Coaster and got a FastPass despite the tour groups were taking all the FastPasses. We wandered around some more, and ended up in the Pixar area. The wait for Toy Story Mania was at least 50 minutes. FastPass was available for 4:00 PM - I kid you not. So we waited in line to take pictures with Buzz Lightyear and Woody.
I noticed that the line to Toy Story Mania was much shorter and the wait was only 30 minutes. Part way through the line is a talking Potato Head that has a conversation with you. So Corbin had an excellent chat. Toy Story Mania is a ride - two people per car - where you wear 3D glasses and shot a gun at different scenes. It's a blast. Even my mom loved the ride.
Headed back to the Rock And Roll Roller Coaster. Didn't have to wait too long with our FastPass. Had an issue after boarding the ride in that Corbin put his arms inside the restraint. A castmember came over and politely told Corbin to put his arms outside. Then it was launch time. That was an amazing launch. Then loops and rolls and all sorts of crazy things. Stopped in at the photo booth and purchased the photo of Corbin and I for delivery to our hotel.
Grabbed our first Disney Dining Plan counter-service during lunch time. An ample individual pizza, salad, pop and a desert. Corbin gobbled up the pizza. Jeremy did too. The desert was good. We were all full.
Tina had had enough of Corbin's anxiety of waiting in line and walked over with Corbin to Customer Services to obtain a Guest Assistance Card. The rest of us shopped in the stores. My mom bought a beautiful jacket to keep her warm. The great thing about staying in the park is the ability to charge purchases to your room. No need to keep a lot of cash or credit cards on you.
The Guest Assistance Card made a difference. We were able to utilize the FastPass line when available. It also enabled us to wait in a more quiet area for any shows. It came in handy for the Indiana Jones Stunt Spectacular. One of the Castmembers even gave us a tip about how to beat the crowd out (wait for Indy to shoot the gun and the explosion and then leave - where you can head over the Star Tours or Jedi Training Academy and beat the crowd). The Indiana Jones Stunt Spectacular was a hit. We all loved it. Jeremy and Corbin were speechless.
Next we took a ride on Star Tours and then walked around some more going to a few more rides and attractions before calling it quits due to the high crowd levels. Those tour groups really messed up the day.

Published: 12 December 2017labor arbitrage
Labor arbitrage is the practice of searching for and then using the lowest-cost workforce to produce products or goods. The use of the term labor arbitrage is limited in its daily use; it is more likely to be used in academic papers and business-consulting reports than in everyday business discussions, although the practice itself is common and widespread.
> arbitrage, which relates to the French word for “refereeing,” comes into English-language business-labor circles from its application in the financial world. In the financial realm it refers to purchasing commodities, financial securities and gold in one market and selling them in another market in a near-immediate transaction (where profits come from the price differentials between those two markets).
The term as it applies to labor specifically has become more common in staffing and workforce discussions during the past few decades, and the practice has become more prevalent due to shifting government policies and societal expectations as well as new technologies that have allowed the practice to be more broadly applied.
Some experts limit the definition of labor arbitrage, saying it applies strictly to taking work from one location to another where there is the same skill set but at lower costs.
However, some experts use a broader definition and say labor arbitrage encompasses multiple corporate policies that result in lowest-cost labor. That lowest-cost labor can come in a variety of forms today. One form is off-shore workers, where companies can hire workers in a foreign country and pay less for wages, payroll taxes, benefits and/or overtime. Another form is using cheaper subcontractors in a company's home country instead of staff employees. Still another form is using work-visa programs to import foreign workers willing to take lower salaries. Companies that pressure existing workers to take lower wages to save their jobs are engaging in labor arbitrage, too. Some experts also consider the use of undocumented immigrants who generally work for less and aren't able to fight for their legal work rights as a form of labor arbitrage.
Companies throughout history have sought to keep labor costs in check, so in some regard the concept of labor arbitrage is not new. However, historically companies were located near their workforce and stayed in those regions over the long term. For example, in the United States, the textile industry was a New England industry through the early 20th century but then moved all its operations to Southern states in part to capitalize on lower labor costs.
Moreover, companies today can more easily opt to engage in labor arbitrage for pieces of their production, engaging different sets of workers for different components of their products or services.
A number of factors have caused this shift in how companies now engage in labor arbitrage, a shift that started following World War II and has continued into this century. Lower national tariffs helped foster global workforce competition. At the same time new technologies broke down barriers that made shifting work away from central corporate facilities easier and more efficient. The Internet and global communications technologies, for example, enable more off-shoring and outsourcing while still allowing corporate controls to be in place.

Join the conversationI recently moved back to the North Shore from the Madison, Wisconsin area, where my family lived for the past two years. During that time, I learned:
- A “bubbler” is a drinking fountain, right? “Right” as used here loosely translates to “Don’t you agree with me?” from Wisconsin-ese.
- Everything in the Badger State tastes better with cheese. Think fried rice topped with mozzarella.
- Hunting is widely popular – camouflage print is the new black in Wisconsin. Currently, the Wisconsin legislature is considering a bill to require the state’s Department of Public Instruction to develop a curriculum for high school students on how to handle and shoot firearms.
- How to attach and remove my bicycle tires to access the seemingly endless scenic trails.
- It can be challenging to assimilate if you’re not originally from the state or didn’t attend school there. I found Madison, home of the crown jewel of the University of Wisconsin System, more insular than I anticipated. Of course, my Bears and Cubs jerseys didn’t help matters.
- Madison isn’t as liberal as its reputation. In fact, there’s a strong evangelical presence immediately outside the city. I shouldn’t have been surprised then by the weekly Christian gathering dubbed “Jesus Lunches” that occurred adjacent to our public high school or that up to a quarter of students there attended said lunches.
- The Wisconsin Idea, the principle that the University of Wisconsin should improve lives beyond UW classrooms, manifests itself in free – yes and unbelievably free – access to scores of cultural gems, from the Chazen Museum of Art to Memorial Library.
- Chicagoans may look down their noses at Cheeseheads but the disdain goes both ways. Many Wisconsinites dislike what they perceive as the pushiness of residents, traffic gridlock, and rampant violence in Chicago. So much so that they’re willing to pay big bucks and endure multiple layovers to avoid flying out of O’Hare.
- While Badger State residents may pride themselves on being “Wisconsin Nice,” the truth is that nice and not-so-nice transcend state lines.
- Visiting a place is not the same as living there. And a related lesson – it’s hard to overstate the value of roots and connections.
- Home isn’t merely where you hang your (cheesehead) hat but where you feel most content, right?

“We aren’t completely sure why,” Lurie told a hastily called news conference at Flint City Hall this evening. “It could be the way the samples were collected.”
Officials say the homeowners have been advised and the homes are being retested.
“If you’re a Flint resident, be sure to get your water tested,” Gov. Rick Snyder tweeted during the press conference at Flint City Hall.
Since last year, the state has been handing out water filters designed to remove lead. The filters are certified to screen out lead up to 150 parts per billion. Officials say special filters are not enough in some Flint homes to screen out high levels of lead in the drinking water.
Mark Durno is with the EPA. He’s the onsite coordinator for the federal response to Flint’s water crisis.
“We’re telling you we still have confidence in the filters,” says Durno, adding, “if you have not had your water tested, get it tested now.”
The problem began back in April, 2014, when the city’s drinking water source was switched from the Detroit system to the Flint River. Without corrosion controls, the river water ate away at the city’s pipes. The damaged pipes have been leaching lead into the drinking water.
The city switched back to Detroit water in October. It’s been hoped that the switch would allow a protective layer within the pipe to reform and contain the lead..
The city has hired Edwards to oversee water testing. He also was appointed by Gov. Rick Snyder to a committee that will set in place long-term solutions.
Lathan Jefferson listened to the news conference at city hall. He’s skeptical about assurances that the water filters will work.
“It’s going to take them going in and putting new pipes in,” says Jefferson. But that’s going to be a long process that has not even begun. Meanwhile, Flint residents are still being urged to use the filters. Many ignore the filters and just drink bottled water.

The Purcellville Cannons lost to the Winchester Royals on Tuesday, ending a season that saw the team leading their division from the beginning.
The Royals clenched the three-game postseason series with a 9-4 win, earning a spot in the North Division finals against the Strasburg Express.
The Cannons had beaten the Royals in the first game of their matchup, but the Royals responded with back-to-back wins.
The Cannons stayed on top of the North Division for almost all of the 2017 season, had four players on the North Division All-Star team, and sent two players to represent the Valley League in the Southern Collegiate Showcase in Kannapolis, North Carolina. The only Valley League team that has won more games this season is the Charlottesville Tom Sox, who are eleven games ahead of their closest rival on the South Division.
Former Purcellville Town Manager Rob Lohr threw out the opening pitch, with his son playing catcher.

I had created arranged in order to meet my lady in a nearby recreation space in order that my own 3 boys could blow-off a number of water prior to planning property for supper.
It had been there in a vehicle recreation area that we noticed a person trying to clay-bar their own automobile. Certain things struck us as unusual. To start with while i have already been based in Exercise the past 20 years We have seldom witnessed someone work with their own automobile along with the following was a man wanting to clay bar! That was fantastic.
Secondly this individual ended up being trying really without success for you to clay bar his / her auto. I couldn’t support myself personally, I needed to bring in personally and offer him several ideas.
Pupil this individual ended up being a us surviving in Europe anf the husband has been organizing the rear spoiler in order that he or she might aluminum foil that. He’d learnt from the Internet in which before using foil that the paint surface has to be decontaminated with a clay-bar. Appropriate! Nevertheless exactly what the forum failed to tell him ended up being just what is a Clay-Bar and ways to use it correctly?
So what is a new Clay Bar?
Inside the Eighties, a few extremely intelligent people in The japanese invented the particular Clay-Bar. Car makers had been trying to find a approach to speedily remove overspray coming from recently coloured autos and never have to vacation resort moist sanding. Nowadays it is unimaginable to get a expert detailer to never make use of a clay-bar.
Decontaminating the color.
Whenever a vehicle can be powered or even sitting outside the house, it will pick-up a few quite unpleasant grime debris like very hot braking system airborne debris, iron debris coming from train songs, street tar residue even unclean rain could imprinted themselves in to the coloring. Inside the describing globe we all call this ‘contamination’ and eliminate substances is certainly a important action i will attempt to describe without sending that you rest.
Soil contaminants upload themselves deeply in to the obvious coating. Washing the car won’t remove these types of partials. It is essential to take away the toxins before sharpening as if you not can become with additional hairline chafes.
I want to make clear. Make a very small small materials regarding fine sand trapped to the surface of the paint. If you don’t take away that wheat involving mud and you review that using a sprucing device that is rotating in 1’500 revs per minuet. In which resolution is certain to get captured inside the mat and also provide simple facts in wonderful round moves. The same as sand paper. That hurts!
Just how Clay Bar aids
Clay bar can be a desperate stop regarding pliable plastic just like content which has a similar uniformity to learn money. Consider it as any ‘dirt magnet’. Since the clay is indeed ‘sticky’, the dirt does not have any chance of clinging on the fresh paint surface area; the idea re-embeds alone on top of the clay bar. Following numerous goes by, the particular clay bar will become packed with substances, which you can observe within the image and for that reason you have to on a regular basis collapsed the particular clay to press the determination to the core of the clay.
What’s crucial when using clay as well as what my good friend in a vehicle car park was without is ‘Lubrication’. Lubes might be clean water or even even better any detailers bottle of spray that you simply spray directly on top of the autos area. Unless you work with a squirt the actual clay will undoubtedly stick to the area, end up being difficult to shift making a terrible mess with pieces of clay adhering your car or truck rather than raising from the dirt. Even worse it could possibly also scratch your car or truck.
Done correctly, it is possible to notice the paint turning into cleaner. That will start as being a itches sound then after a few goes gets silent as well as less noisy. I’m talking about the actual clay undertaking it can be operate raising off of all of the nasty’s.
Once you’ve done your coloring has become de-contaminated.
Also an important tip! Should you unintentionally decline your own clay, throw it away. There isn’t any chance of keeping becoming soon as it has contacted the floor; it’s picked out more dirt this ever could from the vehicle. In the event you begin to use that once more, it’s going to scratch the coloring.Eight car salesmen have been arrested in what law enforcement officials say is the biggest counterfeiting case on Long Island in more than 15 years.
The men were charged with possession of more than 1 million of counterfeit currency, $700,000 of which was seized by the U.S. Secret Service.
Samuel Zona, special agent in charge of the Secret Service's Melville, N.Y., office, which has jurisdiction over Nassau and Suffolk counties on New York's Long Island, said that the counterfeiting case was the largest in the area since the Secret Service opened its office there in 1977.
Officials believe that another half million dollars of counterfeit bills are still missing, which raises the prospect of some of the money eventually finding its way into circulation.
While the case is a mere drop in the bucket of the more than $80 million of counterfeit U.S. dollars seized each year, it illustrates the need for continued vigilance by banks and retailers to keep counterfeiters at bay.
"We get more currency turned into us from banks than from any other source," said Joseph D'Angelillio, supervisor of the Secret Service's counterfeit squad in Manhattan, which has jurisdiction over the five boroughs of New York.
Drug Link Cited
In addition to protecting he President, the Secret Service handles all counterfeiting cases in the country.
Authorities believe that much of the counterfeit money is made outside the U.S., and is smuggled into the country by drug cartels, through traditional contraband smuggling routes.
Authorities have no evidence that the money seized on Long Island had any tie to the drug trade. But they do believe it was imported - specifically, that is was made in Austria and delivered to Long Island by Swiss citizens who have not been named in the complaints.
Authorities Tipped Off
The authorities believe that the Swiss citizens delivered the money to a pair of Long Island car salesmen, Thomas J. Cunningham, 28, of East Patchogue, N.Y., and 23-year-old John J. Vallone, of Seaford, N.Y.
These two men were said to have enlisted the help of five car salesmen at a Toyota dealership in Westbury, N.Y., who were given several thousand dollars of counterfeit $100 bills to test by spending the money at local merchants.
Some of the money made it to a local bank that has not been named, that in turn notified the authorities.
Buried in the Woods
The $700,000 that was recovered had been buried in a wooded area in Oakdale, N.Y.
An eighth defendant, 28-year-old Robert J. Brower 3d, of East Patchogue, was charged with trying to get rid of another another half million dollars of counterfeit money, in order to keep it out of the hands of the police.
Authorities believe most of the money was thrown away in a garbage can in front of a home East Patchogue, and has not been recovered.
90% Recovery Rate
If convicted, each of the defendants faces a maximum of 15 years imprisonment, and a $250,000 fine.
Gayle Moore, a Secret Service special agent and spokesperson in Washington, D.C., said that seizures of counterfeit money have held steady at about $80 million a year since 1989. Nine-tenths of this money is normally seized before it is spent
The biggest problem areas are New York, Los Angeles and Miami. In the year ended in October, 1992, the most recent period for which figures are available, $40 million of counterfeit money was recovered from these cities, $6 million of which was recovered after it had been spent.
Photocopying a New Problem
The majority of counterfeit money is made by printing presses, which limits counterfeiting to only those people with printing expertise.
But an increasing problem is the photocopying of money with high-quality color copiers, a practice that makes it possible for broader range of people to make phony money that can appear to be very authentic.
Mr. D'Angelillio, of the Manhattan office of the Secret Service, said that in New York the agency seizes about $45,000 each week of printed counterfeit bills, and another $6,000 and $7,000 a week of phony money that has been photocopied.The USL has posted its conference alignment for the 2018 regular season.

The progress was made possible by an agreement by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) to allow AlDOT to combine construction of the Outer Loop with construction of an I-85 extension into a single project. The agreement means the $100 million already approved for the I-85 extension now can be used on the Outer Loop.
AlDOT plants to begin accepted bids on May 27 for the first of several components of the Outer Loop project, which includes a large interchange and a 3-mile segment of the limited-access highway.
AlDOT has already spent $55 million to do an environmental assessment, land acquisition and a small amount of excavation for the Outer Loop.
The agreement culminates a two-year effort by AlDOT to win FHWA approval to combine the two projects.
AlDOT plans to extend I-85 west to connect to I-20 and I-59 in Cuba, Ala.LAS VEGAS (AP) — Officials in Las Vegas say McCarran International Airport handled more passengers in March than a year earlier.
Data released Tuesday by the Clark County Department of Aviation show more than 4.2 million people flew in and out of the airport last month. That’s 3.2 percent more than March of 2016.
More than 3.8 million of the passengers who walked through McCarran last month traveled in domestic flights, while over 284,000 people traveled in international flights.
Southwest Airlines continued to be the busiest carrier at the airport, transporting more than 1.5 million passengers in March.
Of the top five airlines serving McCarran, only American Airlines saw a decrease in passengers over the year.
Airport officials have tallied more than 11.3 million passengers through March. McCarran handled 47.4 million passengers in 2016.

Category: Decoration IdeasI'm in my first online course this semester. It's a learning experience for me. There's just something about never actually seeing or talking to a professor or other students that makes it hard for me to believe that it's a real class.
Each week, two students are in charge of leading the discussion. Next week is my week...
Last night, in an effort to treat the online course like the credit that it's worth, I emailed my partner (Erika) and we decided to meet for lunch today and figure out a plan of attack.
In an unbelievable stroke of luck not only was my partner a gorgeous southern belle (redundant?), but we are in the same class which immediately followed lunch.
Lunch when swimmingly, we walked to class together and I sat next to her.
Allow me to digress...
Two years ago, my poetry writing professor mentioned to the class, "Each of us believes that we can accurately read someone else's thoughts while still keeping our own thoughts hidden."
I disagreed, thinking, I'm better at judging people than they are at judging me.
(End digression)
There's a girl in our class that keeps a food blog. She eats something weird everyday and blogs about it. Before class, people were talking about her next culinary conquest, some kind of exotic bratwurst sausage. It went a little something like this...
Blog girl: "I really don't know if I can get it down"
Male student: "What do you mean?"
Blog girl: "I just don't think I can put it in my mouth, it just looks so gross"
Professor: "You should blindfold yourself"
Erika: "Yeah, then you can just put the whole thing in your mouth and be done with it"
Blog girl: "Maybe I'll try it. I don't know, it's gonna be hard..."
(I listened in silence with a small smirk on my face)
Just as class was beginning, without even looking at me, Erika leaned over and said, "You're a pervert."

Haha, amazing. You would think though that at least someone in the class would have had the courage to drop a "that's what she said" in front of the whole class and become a legend for the rest of the semester.If You Enjoy Computer Games Guides

The cancer society is seeking “champions” who will help enroll 10 people or more apiece in April on the way to getting 500 residents from the area enrolled in a 20- to 30-year community study called Cancer Prevention Study-3.
“We would love to far exceed that, if possible,” said Danielle Truan, the mission delivery manager for the cancer society’s Augusta office.
The group will hold a kick-off beginning at 8 a.m. Wednesday in Chafee Hall at the Salvation Army of Augusta Kroc Center, 1833 Broad St.
Nationwide, the study is seeking about 300,000 people between ages 30 and 65 who have never had a diagnosis of cancer. Participants would register online to get an appointment to provide a small amount of blood, waist circumference and other baseline measures. Participants would answer surveys every few years to help researchers narrow down who is developing cancer and perhaps why, Truan said.
“The goal of the study is prevention of cancer so they are going to be asking specific questions in these surveys and be looking for specific factors: lifestyle, genetic, environmental, medical history, these types of things,” she said. Some, unfortunately will develop cancer, but researchers “are hoping that their findings will make sense in terms of the things that are pointing to a cancer diagnosis in a specific person’s life.”Bragg Adocio
As I Lay Dying - Poem by Bragg Adocio
As I Lay Dying
Birds are chirping songs on billboard's top three, because your body doesn't make that funny little whistle sound when you dropp from the second floor. And yet, any dropp you take automatically, apparently, has enough time to play a montage of your life to an audience of one and a room full of critics that measure the contents of your life as playable in a two-story drop.
Twenty feet of gravity and the only one that matters is the last. That last second. But, I guess, if it's only twenty feet, the first second is your last.
As life flows by with every regret multiplied ten-fold like a river, before you even get the chance to say Mississippi, time slows just enough to make you remember what you had chosen to forget, and make you regret that which you cannot remember.
The past is nothing but a memory, but when your present is a clear shot at your future, a fall could make you wish you were dreaming. A wake-up call to a restless REMnant as he falls from the bed, crashing down from the top floor of his imagination, clipped wings of the one who dreams of being a pilot.... Followed by a loud thud, and soft warm carpet, then a yell from afar in loving concern.
But if your lucky, a fall from that wall might just have you catching window pains. As you hit the ground, bleeding, sprawled out on the sidewalk, screaming, did you get a good look at your meaning?
Those flashes of light are only media lights, and you shouldn't stare at the sun or you might damage your eyes, though even in your damaged body it isn't pain you feel but a change in your life.

CPD-18841 15K 10/04 CLPut your finger on the black spot on the new U.S. postage stamp and the darkness vanishes to reveal an image of the full moon. Magic? No. It’s fat.
The nifty thermochromic stamp — created to honor Monday’s total eclipse of the sun and being snapped up by collectors and fun-loving folks everywhere — works like Crisco. At room temperature, the shortening is a gloppy, white paste that liquefies into a clear, shiny soup when warm. The novelty stamp, however, won’t leave fingers oily, black or cold.
“They’re esters. But it’s not like the fat right here,” said Lyle Small, pointing to his stomach, which doesn’t jiggle much at all. “These are special kinds of fat that come from vegetable sources — really specific chemicals with an exact melting point.”
Small, the founder of Chromatic Technologies Inc. in Colorado Springs, and his 54-person team provided the special thermochromic ink for the 60 million solar-eclipse stamps printed this summer by the U.S. Postal Service. It “melts” at around 84.2 degrees Fahrenheit. Also, it is the first U.S. stamp to use heat-activated ink, a technology unavailable 38 years ago — the last time a total solar eclipse was seen in the contiguous U.S. And it has helped spread enthusiasm for science across the nation.
“I’m a nerd. A proud nerd,” Small said. “And to have something like the eclipse, I will be making my way to Wyoming.”
Small plans to pitch a tent somewhere in Wyoming to catch the 160 seconds of complete blockage of the sun by the moon.
Thermochromics have been around since the 1970s. Small’s company, which he started while in college in the 1990s, has its own lab with scientists creating new molecules, perfecting colors and tweaking reactions to light and temperature. The company also is working on inks that can tell people whether their boxed milk or unrefrigerated hummus went through a high-pressure, bacteria-killing pasteurization process. And it’s working with the University of Colorado to use inks and dyes as a cancer treatment.
For now, though, Chromatic Technologies is enjoying the fun stuff. As are philatelists, or stamp collectors.
“Well,” said John Sinski, president of the Rocky Mountain Philatelic Library in Denver, “I would say almost everybody I know that collects U.S. stamps is trying to make sure they have copies of this one.”
Some members also plan to travel to Casper or other cities in the path of the full eclipse. They’ll be taking the stamps and mailing letters back to themselves from those cities to get them postmarked on the date, he said.
U.S. stamps incorporating novel technologies are rare. In June, the Postal Service launched “Have a Ball!” stamps, featuring popular sporting balls with texture to mimic the feel of a baseball’s stitching, a golf ball’s dimples and a soccer ball’s panels.
The most memorable U.S. stamp came in July 2000 — the first U.S. holographic stamp. The space-themed stamp was the nation’s first circular one.
“We’ve seen all kinds of varieties of stamps from other countries,” said Sinski, 73, who began collecting stamps at age 8. “A lot use holograms. Some use foil. There are all kinds of gimmicky stamps, especially from smaller countries that don’t use a lot of stamps themselves but make money selling them to collectors.”
The eclipse stamp, launched June 20 and available at usps.com, is limited to a 60-million run, said USPS spokesman Mark Saunders.
“The stamps have been extremely popular in large part due to the educational information it helps communicate about the upcoming eclipse,” Saunders said, “And also for its first-of-its-kind feature for a U.S. postage stamp that enables the image to change from the heat of a finger.”
The Postal Service receives 40,000 suggestions for stamp ideas a year, but only 20-25 make the cut. The eclipse stamp, which features a photo of the total eclipse viewed from Libya in 2006, has been in the works for more than a year.
Fred Espenak, a retired NASA astrophysicist who took the photo, said he was first contacted by the Postal Service a year and a half ago to check documents for eclipse accuracy. He didn’t hear that his photo, nor that heat-activated ink would be used, until around last Thanksgiving.
“I thought it was an intriguing idea. I hadn’t heard of the technology myself,” said Espenak, who is traveling to Casper for the event. “Since then, I heard they use (the ink) on beer cans.”
Chromatic Technologies does use similar ink on beer cans — specifically, the Coors Light cans that make the mountains turn blue when the can is cold. Chromatic Technologies started working on the eclipse project in April, just about two months before the stamp’s debut. Good thing the company has a library of 2,000 different inks, based on color, temperature and reaction to light.
To make UV Screen Black 29 degrees Celsius — the official name of the black ink used in the stamp — the company mixes fat, dye and developer.
The fat, similar to fats used in lipsticks and lotions, melts at 29 degrees Celsius, approximately 84.2 degrees Fahrenheit. It’s mixed with a leuco dye that can switch from color to colorless. Then the company adds a developer, which injects a proton into the dye, making the ink go black.
“The heat from your finger melts the fat, and when the fat melts, the developer disassociates from the dye and wants to become associated with the fat. And the dye shuts off,” Small said. “When I rub the stamp, I’m melting the fat. As I let go, the fat gets back to the solid state and the proton donor wants to go back to the dye.”
While the interactive stamp gives consumers an animated glimpse of what will happen Monday, pretty much everyone in this story plans to be in Casper for the event — even though bumper-to-bumper traffic is anticipated.
“This is something you don’t want to watch as a partial eclipse,” said Espenak, a.k.a. “Mr. Eclipse,” who left for Wyoming this week. “Especially if you’re in Denver, you want to get up to Wyoming. The difference between seeing a partial eclipse versus a full eclipse is like watching the Super Bowl from box seats in the stadium versus your car in the parking lot.”Next has been awarded the contract for the design and construction of The Buckland residential development.

Note: Riot Games is not a Higher Logic client, nor did Higher Logic work with Riot Games around this issue. We just found this to be an inspiring story and a great example of fine community management at work. We’re excited to share the story with you.
How do you change the behavior of millions of community members? That’s the problem Riot Games had to solve with their game, League of Legends, when they realized that antisocial behavior - like gamers using racial and homophobic slurs with each other - had reached toxic levels.
By using social science and tons (and TONS!) of data, Riot Games uncovered tactics to reduce - if not end - toxic trolling within their game, League of Legends. League of Legends has 67 million players (27 million a day) and grossed an estimated $1.25 billion in revenue in 2015, but it’s reputation for toxic gamer behavior, such as gamers often making racist and homophobic remarks, made it hard to attract and retain players. Just because their gaming community created certain community norms didn’t mean that Riot Games had to maintain them - especially if they were hurtful to fellow gamers and deterred new people from playing their game. Toxic behavior, like racist and homophobic comments between teammates, created a very poor user experience for most of their players, so they set out to change their gamers’ behavior.
Riot Games hired Jeffrey Lin, who had just received his PhD in cognitive neuroscience. Jeffrey was to act as a game designer and had access to the company’s seemingly endless supply of user data. The first thing he did was assemble a team to go over thousands of log chats (chats between players) to get a clear picture of what was currently happening in the game.
From his team’s analysis, they discovered that roughly 1% of the players were considered toxic - but they only accounted for 5% of all ‘toxic’ activity. This revelation was surprising, since it’s usually believed that most people don’t engage in bad behavior. Rather than just a few trolls bringing the community down, the culture at large allowed everyone to participate in toxic behavior at some level. That gave Jeffrey an important clue: he needed to change the entire culture - no small feat, given the vast number of players.
As any community builder would know, changing a widespread cultural problem is extremely difficult. But Jeffrey and his team had two incredible advantages working for them - autonomy and data.
Although Jeffrey has a PhD in cognitive neuroscience, he turned to psychology 101 basics. He decided to test ‘priming’ - where a person is exposed to something and their reaction is measured. Priming sounds more complicated than it is.
Jeffrey and his team ‘primed’ gamers with color coded tips throughout the game. Here’s an example tip: “Teammates perform worse if you harass them.” They discovered the tips performed best if they were in red boxes. Overall, they reduced verbal abuse by 6.2% and offensive language by 11%.
They were on the right track. But if Jeffrey’s team wanted to essentially revamp a toxic culture including millions of gamers, they needed better results.
That’s when Jeffrey introduced a brand new aspect of the game - “The Tribunal.” Gamers needed to be directly involved to effect lasting change and help transform the culture from the inside out.
Now, whenever a gamer reports another gamer, the misbehaving gamer ends up in The Tribunal - a jury of their peers.
Results showed most people didn’t know what rules they had broken. If they were never informed, they’d often pick up their old habits and continually be suspended from the game. But when players were told why they were in The Tribunal, 50% didn’t misbehave again for at least three months.
Equally interesting, when those people received written feedback from members of The Tribunal, the reform rate soared to 70%. And when offenders received feedback within 5-10 minutes of their infractions, the reform rate reached 92%.
Although Jeffrey’s work for Riot Games is impressive, most people don’t have access to the amount of data League of Legends created. Even if they did, it takes time, money and expertise to run the types of studies Jeffrey did.
But there are a few nuggets in this study that anyone could learn from and apply in their own community, no matter the size or toxicity level..
Unfortunately, you can’t assume everyone will know how to interact in your community. Just as it takes work to learn how to be a community manager or builder, it can take work to learn how to become a productive community member.
That’s why it’s so important to create comprehensive guidelines for your members. They need a document they can look at and you can reference, outlining what good behavior looks like and what your strategy is for dealing with toxic behavior.
When disciplining members, be sure to spell out exactly what they did wrong. Although it probably seems obvious to you, you can’t assume they know what they did wrong. This goes back to giving members guidance - take this as an opportunity to educate. You may be surprised by the outcome.
As Riot Games found, the reform rate for toxic behavior climbs when offenders get feedback from their peers. This doesn’t mean you should create your own Tribunal, but it does show how much people care about what their peers think. If possible, let members self moderate and call out the toxic behavior.
Speed is key - the faster you deal with toxic behavior, the better. In Riot Games’ study, the faster they reprimanded the offender, the more likely they they were to stop.What’s the true meaning of “I and my Father are one”?
By Wang Ya In the past, I saw the Bible recorded, “And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway […]
Like most of the brothers and sisters in the Lord, I have read the Bible over and over again all these years and already loved the Bible. Reading the Bible, memorizing the Bible, and copying the Bible has already become an indispensable part of my life of believing in the Lord. Like many believers in the Lord, I also believe that belief in the Lord is belief in the Bible, that if one strays from the Bible then he cannot be called a believer in the Lord, and that all scripture is the word of God and is inspired by God. The Bible has become the holy book in our hearts, which is absolutely without blemish or error. We don’t care whether we have the work of the Holy Spirit, and can still carry on living even if we cannot touch the presence of the Lord, but as soon as we lose the Bible, then it is as if we have lost our life. However, we have no idea what the origins of the Bible are, what exactly kind of book the Bible is, and who is the author of the Bible.
One day, on a famous website I saw many books of truth which revealed lots of mysteries rarely known by people, including the mystery of the Bible. There was a passage saying: ” (“Concerning the Bible (4)”).
From this passage of words I understood that the Bible contains not only God’s words but also many words of man, and that only when we differentiate between God’s words and man’s words in the Bible can we treat the Bible properly. In fact, God’s words in the Bible include the word God spoke to Moses, the revelation of God to the prophets, the word of the Lord Jesus, and the prophecies in the Book of Revelation. Most of the other words in the Bible are actually man’s words, among which, some are the experiences and understandings originating from the enlightenment and illumination of God, and some are the records of the historical figures and events. Besides, the Bible also documents some words of Satan, such as the words the serpent said to entice Eve, and the words Satan spoke to tempt the Lord Jesus.
Moreover, from the formation of the Bible I saw that God’s work is always performed before it is compiled by man. For example, the New Testament came into existence after A.D. 300. Later generations compiled the records of the Lord Jesus’ work and words kept by the apostles and disciples during the period of their following the Lord Jesus into the Four Gospels; meanwhile they also compiled some of the apostles’ and disciples’ experiences and understandings including Paul’s letters into the Bible, regardless of whether they came from the enlightenment and guidance of the Holy Spirit or from the notions and imaginations of man. After the Bible became a book, generation after generation of believers in God have been regarding it as precious treasure, exalting and preaching it till today. However, it cannot be denied that, no matter how people treasure this book, the letters, experiences, and understandings of the apostles in it are not the words of God; even though some of them accord with the truth, they can only be taken as words inspired by the Holy Spirit, and can never be confused with the words of God.
Actually every chapter of the Bible has its author, and was recorded and compiled by man. The human records are always mixed with human will and imaginations and have errors. For example, the Old Testament records, ). From these two verses we can see that one verse says the LORD God moved David to number Israel while the other records it was Satan that provoked David to number Israel. In addition, regarding the death of Judas, one verse says, “And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself” (Matthew 27:5), and another says, “Now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the middle, and all his bowels gushed out” (Acts 1:18). It can be seen that the same thing is recorded differently in these two verses. If they were the words given by inspiration of God, there wouldn’t be these discrepancies. From this, I came to realize that the author of the Bible is man rather than God. So the records concerning God and God’s work, which are compiled by corrupt people, will inevitably be mixed with man’s imaginations, notions, and definitions, and even have many absurd sayings and conclusions. The well-known Jesus’ genealogy written by Matthew is a most typical example. This book of truth says: ?” (“Concerning the Bible (3)”). Therefore, it is entirely because Matthew didn’t understand the truth that he created the genealogy for Jesus; it actually came from his enthusiasm and betrayed God’s will. This proves that the Bible isn’t given by inspiration of God, and that the author of the Bible is man and not God.
Since the author of the Bible is not God Himself but man, it is erroneous and extremely preposterous that we take all the words in the Bible as the words of God and think the Bible is given by inspiration of God. I saw the words in the book of truth: ” (“Concerning the Bible (3)”).
If it were not for this book of truth revealing to us the mysteries of the Bible, we would never understand them or see through the root and essence of the problems even if we experience for a lifetime. This is absolutely true. Actually none of the authors of the Bible, except Moses and prophets who were directly instructed by God to convey the word of Him, dared say their words were inspired or revealed by God. The Lord Jesus never said such thing, nor did the Holy Spirit. If any of the authors of the Bible dared say that, it is blasphemy against God. As those who compiled the Bible didn’t tell people how to treat the Bible correctly, later generations formed a wrong view on it. They can’t distinguish between God’s words and man’s words in the Bible, and as a result, they treat man’s words as God’s words to adhere to and follow, and nullify God’s words, which completely stray from God’s will. In fact, prophets just convey God’s words. People used by the Holy Spirit are also unable to express God’s words, because they don’t possess what God has and is. They can only speak of their own experiences and testimonies under the enlightenment and illumination of the Holy Spirit to provide and support people, which conforms to the truth and God’s will but can never be compared to God’s words. The Bible documents some words that Paul and other apostles spoke according to the actual situation of the churches of the time, and some of Paul’s words were compiled into the thirteen epistles. However, these words were spoken for the sake of building the churches and establishing the believers’ faith, and some of them were inspired by the Holy Spirit when they bore a burden for the church. It can’t be said that these words were inspired by God. But we not only worship the Bible, but even treat man’s words in the Bible as God’s words, holding on to the view that all scripture was given by the inspiration of God. We are so foolish. Isn’t it opposing and blaspheming God?
At this point, we should understand that the Bible is a historical record of the work of Jehovah God in the Age of Law and the work of the Lord Jesus in the Age of Grace, and was written by man; the words of the Bible are not completely the words of God, nor are they inspired by God. Therefore, the notion that “belief in God is belief in the Bible” is wrong, because the author of the Bible is man and!Another busy week full of work and wedding. I'm pulling together posts about our amazing wedding ring DIY and about a fun fashion event I attended on Sunday. I'll have them up soon. In the meantime I thought I'd share a few of the items on my spring wish list.
The week before our wedding {msL} and I will be going to the courthouse in DC to get a legal marriage license and take our vows in front of the Justice of the Peace. You see we live in Virginia where our marriage will not be legally recognized. Luckily for us we live close to DC and Maryland where marriage equality is in place. Laws and minds have come so far but there is still a long way to go. Please support marriage equality in your state. Hopefully one day soon our marriage will be recognized in every state. I want a pretty dress to wear to the courthouse and I love this polka dot dress from Coldwater Creek.
I've been waiting until after the wedding to make any changes to my hair. This is killing me. I change my hair often and I'm sure I'll be doing something like adding an ombre look or cutting it shorter.
I wear my flats much more than my heels. My flats are starting to look a bit old so I'm on the hunt for fun new flats I can wear all spring and summer. These mirror silver flats from ASOS are great. I love the pointed toe and the ankle strap.
A leather skirt has been on my list for some time. Leather is hot this spring and I'm going to get myself a great skirt. Pencil skirts just don't work on my curvy body. This full style is perfect.
Crystals, pearls and skulls, FANTASTIC! One of my favorite things is to mix tough with pretty. This statement necklace is a dream for me in that department. I definitely need this one on my wish list.
My handbag collection is a bit nuts. This spring I'm planning a closet clean out. I'll be purging the bags I never use and replacing a few of them with classics that I'll use often. This tan tote from Zara is the perfect replacement. It's large enough for work but sleek and polished. The tan color will go with everything this spring.

Partner post:Grape Boycott in New York City Protests Use of Pesticides
NEW YORK
NEW YORK CITY has become a focal point in the battle by the United Farm Workers of America to limit use of pesticides by growers of California table grapes. Several of the city's largest supermarket chains, representing 126 stores, have moved recently to limit or halt grape sales. The grocers' action is in support of the union's contention that the pesticides cause health problems in farm workers and could threaten the well-being of consumers. The boycott is the culmination of five years of efforts by the union and its president, Cesar Chavez.
Almost all domestic table grapes come from California. New York City is the second-largest market for them, after Los Angeles.
Store officials say the grape issue is part of a broader problem, and that they are aiming to send a message. ``We have to draw the line someplace with all the pesticides being used by the farmers,'' says John Catsimatidis, chief executive of Red Apple Companies, which owns several store chains. He questions whether grapes are any more harmful for consumers than other produce exposed to pesticides. Still, he compares concerns about them to the recent controversy over the chemical Alar, which apple growers agreed to stop using in the face of public concern.
Bruce Obbink, president of the California Table Grape Commission, representing growers, says there is no proof of harmful effects. ``I say, `C'mon Cesar, you make these charges - somebody has got to have tested grapes and show some results.' Nobody finds something.''
He says that Mr. Chavez is using the pesticide issue to force unionization of the 60,000 California grape pickers. ``It is extremely unfortunate that supermarkets let themselves be bullied around by an economic terrorist,'' Mr. Obbink says.
Union officials concede that their effort to get growers to allow open elections among the grape pickers is a factor in the boycott, but they insist the pesticide issue is real. Union vice-president Arturo Rodriguez says California has documented serious health problems in grape-growing communities.
The union contends that five chemicals sprayed on - or injected into - the grapes are dangerous: Captan, methyl bromide, phosdrin, parathion, and Dinoseb. Union leaders also argue that consumers may face a long-term risk from the pesticide residues that remain on the grapes.
``There is ample evidence that there is a problem with pesticides,'' Mr. Rodriguez says, although the Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Agriculture say it has not been proved. ``Both agencies have been proven wrong time and again on their testing methods. They test right now less than 1 percent of all the produce in our country. Of over 600 chemicals used in agriculture, they have only properly tested 20 or so.''
Some stores are banning California table grapes completely, while others will institute periodic bans and restrict advertising to foster awareness of the issue.0 👍

A friend and I recently spent several enjoyable hours making the rounds and visiting some – but not all – of the participating art galleries.
Art galleries and art spaces currently participating are:
- Beatnik Studios – 723 S Street
- ARTHOUSE on R – 1021R Street, 2nd Floor
- Casa de Espanol – 1101 R Street
- WAL Public Market – 1104 R Street
- Warehouse Artist Lofts – 1108 R Street
- 1810 Gallery – 1810 12th Street
- Raphael Delgado Art Studio – 1200 S Street

Among the galleries we visited was the Sparrow Gallery which recently (June 1) moved into the ARTHOUSE on R Building (1st Floor).
We arrived at the start of the event. We were glad we did as we had the chance to take our time viewing the art and chatting with the artists. Later that evening it became more crowded.
My friend has artistic talent, and she was very interested to see and learn more about some of the techniques utilized to create the various works of art. As someone who has taken classes she also has an appreciation as to level of difficulty involved in creating some of the paintings we viewed.
We saw quite a few intriguing works of art. One of the works I enjoyed was the painting of a bubbling brook amid trees and rocks. What made it stand out? When you looked closely you saw a sprinkling of music scores embedded in the painting. Many of us, I am sure, have appreciated the music created by a creek or stream as it tumbles over rocks in a natural setting. I certainly have.
I also enjoyed the opportunity to chat briefly with a fabric collage artist whose work I had seen and admired previously in the downtown Sacramento CalEPA building. The artist, Merle Axelrad, mentioned that the CalEPA commission had been her first public art commission.
Towards the end of our evening we had worked up a thirst so we decided to stop at the Shady Lady Saloon for a drink before heading home. The place was packed, but we were able to secure a table on the outside patio. I headed to the bar to secure our drinks as table service on the outside patio is only provided if food is ordered. Luckily I was served in short order – likely because I was not ordering any complicated mixed drinks.
The R Street Corridor is now also home to a number of restaurants including the Iron Horse Tavern and Amaro. See related posts: Iron Horse Tavern – Sacramento Restaurants and Amaro – Sacramento Restaurants.
Taking advantage of the close proximity, dinner at one of the nearby restaurants before or after attending the R Street Corridor First Friday Art Walk sounds appealing. Next time.
Have you participated in the R Street Corridor First Friday Art Walk? What is your favorite gallery?

The opportunity to see the work of so many artists, all within close proximity, is truly a privilege. Whether it’s on Second Saturday or on First Friday, the experience is always satisfying and enriching.
Yes, agreed!The Sovereign Order of Malta is participating in the 71st United Nations General Assembly, which opened on 19 September, in New York. The topic of the general debate of the annual Session is “The Sustainable Development Goals: A universal push to transform our world”. The Grand Hospitaller of the Sovereign Order of Malta Dominique de La Rochefoucauld-Montbel spoke at the High Level Meeting on Addressing Large Movements of Refugees and Migrants and will be engaged in other meetings during the course of the event, ending on September 26.
In his address in the plenary session, the Grand Hospitaller made a strong plea: “We call for development programs which must cover extended time periods, complemented by emergency aid for immediate suffering. We call for adequate funding for the humanitarian and development fields. To respond to the challenge, the recommendations of the World Humanitarian Summit – on bridging the humanitarian-development gap – must be implemented”.
With over 60 million people displaced around the world, the Grand Hospitaller emphasised the importance of including faith-based organizations and institutions when addressing the enormous humanitarian needs at stake. An important step was taken at the Istanbul World Humanitarian Summit last May, when the Order of Malta reaffirmed the special role faith based aid agencies play in the field of humanitarian assistance.
As the Grand Hospitaller noted “Religious-based organizations develop networks of support and solidarity, can be the liaison between diasporas and affected populations, and are often trusted by local communities”.
Another important engagement for the Order of Malta was the participation in the roundtable on Addressing the Vulnerability of Refugees and Migrants on their journeys from their countries of origin to their countries of arrival.
Drawing from the long-term experience in emergency and assistance programmes for migrants and refugees around the world – at sea and on land- Dominique de La Rochefoucauld-Montbel stressed the need to reaffirm and respect humanitarian laws and human rights: “We strongly believe that no human being is illegal and therefore s/he has rights. These rights are not being respected. If you take away the status of a human being, you take away his basic rights. This is how refugees and migrants are being treated” he stated.
The Grand Hospitaller called for a stronger cooperation between migration authorities and child protection services and for enhancing protection of women and girls, all too often subject to different sorts of physical and psychological violence during their treacherous journeys.Sorry HP, The Slate 7 Is Dead On Arrival; Nobody Trusts You Any More
I displays and cheap plastic, you’ll remember how we were all regarded as the rich and fancy business kids of the block.
Then came HP. I’d say the transition benefited HP more than it benefited Compaq. If not, try to compare the gorgeous design of an iPAQ back then with the cheap-looking HP Jornada. HP did a bold move though, as they adopted the iPAQ as their product and began focusing on making Pocket PC’s smaller and more portable at the same time as they also made them cheaper. Let’s just say HP single-handedly sunk Palm’s PDA business back then by making the Pocket PC the mainstream PDA of choice. That also marked my transition into my future with HP Pocket PCs and even smartphones, as well as laptops and printers. I don’t regret those days at all.
Sadly HP’s problem was always the fact that they were a big ship that was commanded by everybody except the captain. Change is always good, but HP spent a great deal of time changing what didn’t need to be changed. As a result, the iPAQ, which HP sadly took away from HTC, became a dying product that people stopped caring about. What to do? Let’s buy Palm they said. Another bold move if you ask me, since they were in-part responsible for nailing Palm’s coffin in the early days, and webOS wasn’t really taking off with the iPhone’s competition. Yeah, well, we already know how that story ended. And if you want me to add even more drama to this article, do any of you remember who built the first slate Tablet PC? Yeah, that was HP too.
So, with the iPAQ dead, the Tablet PC failures, and even the once-glorious Palm dead and their most precious asset webOS being sold to LG, HP is now giving Android tablets a try. No I am not kidding you. The same company that never figured out how to sell Tablet PCs, Pocket PCs, Smartphones, nor even their own mobile operating system is now back with another change. A clear example of a company that doesn’t have a clue of what they’re doing, but that still want’s to do everything.
Is this change really going to drive HP to the future? I’ll give you a couple of my ideas as to why not.
HP, sadly hardware-only OEMs are not succeeding
HP’s biggest problem is that their new HP Slate 7 is just another cheap Android tablet. There is nothing special about it except for the price tag. You’d argue that Android OEMs are hardware-only, but they really aren’t. They could’ve all chosen to just bundle stock Android on their products, but HTC, Samsung and even Nokia on the Windows Phone arena have decided to push their base operating systems with enough custom software to make their products differentiate themselves from the crowd. These companies have all invested hard on software, and in the case of Samsung in particular, the positive results are seen clearly.
Now if you would flip the switch and bring players like Motorola, Huawei, Acer or others that only bundle minimal software in their products and don’t really invest in enhancing your experience with the product, and what you get is sadly a pool full of good ideas that die young. I don’t mention Sony on purpose here, as they’ve failed for other reasons that don’t have to do with their products.
I guess my biggest question to HP is: Why oh why did you not push this tablet with webOS? Yes, we know it struggled in its day, but there were apps and a solid community behind it and all. It surely would’ve been a rough ride to the top, but the Slate 7’s possibilities of adoption were much larger with webOS than with Android. Why, because of the webOS cult following. The world doesn’t need or care about another Android tablet no matter how well it’s priced.
HP, people don’t trust you any more
Do I need to repeat all the once-successful products that have died terrible deaths in the clutches of HP? After the whole HP TouchPad debacle, the last thing I want in March is to spend $170 on a tablet that HP will drop and re-price to just $50 the next day because their executives have no clue as to how much a new product needs to be in store shelves to take off.
HP either has no clear understanding of the market, or of their customers in general, and after all the stunts they’ve pulled in the last decade, I’m sad to admit that it seems HP doesn’t even have a clue of anything anymore. Don’t you find this to be such an irony coming from one of the pioneers of the mobile space, which also absorbed other pioneers like Palm and Compaq in the process?
The Bottom Line
Even at the time when HP dropped the price of the TouchPad to just $100, I decided to skip the product even though I was more than capable of buying a couple of them. The reason why is because if not even HP believed in their own product back then, why should I do any different? I don’t think HP understands the depth of that mistake, but it was huge.
What HP needed was new blood to succeed in mobile, and instead of using these assets in their Palm or Compaq transitions, they decided to continue relying on their experts (who had already failed in everything before).
Do I want HP to succeed? Yes I do. There’s a big part of me that wished I wasn’t typing this on a Mac after three of my previous HP laptops crashed due to motherboard issues just days after the warranty expired on each. I do wish that they figured it out, but I honestly doubt they will if their plans are to just “compete”. The mobile market of today is about innovating more than others, and the HP Slate 7 is sadly just another me-too product.
What about you? Are you planning to buy an HP Slate 7 at least for the price tag? Please share your comments down bellow.In Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37 the High Court has unanimously allowed an appeal from a decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, which had increased the sentence imposed on William David Bugmy.
Bugmy is an Indigenous person who "grew up in circumstances of social deprivation".
He grew up in a household in which alcohol abuse and violence were commonplace. He has had little formal education and is unable to read or write. He started drinking alcohol and taking prohibited drugs when he was 13 years old. He reports having witnessed his father stabbing his mother 15 times. He and his siblings all have records for violence. The appellant's record of juvenile offending commenced when he was 12 years old. From that age he was regularly detained in juvenile detention centres. When he turned 18 he was transferred to an adult prison. He has a long record of convictions including for offences of violence. He was 29 years old at the date of the present offences. He has spent much of his adult life in prison. He gives a history of repeated suicide attempts. He has maintained a long-term relationship with a woman by whom he has a daughter. He and his partner are both alcoholics. The child has been placed in the care of her maternal grandmother. The appellant also has a history of head injury and of auditory hallucinationsBugmy had been convicted in the District Court of New South Wales for intentionally causing grievous bodily harm to a correctional services officer while incarcerated at Broken Hill. Bugmy was sentenced to a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of four years with a balance of term of two years. The DPP appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeal on the ground that the sentence was manifestly inadequate.
The Supreme Court in R v Bugmy [2012] NSWCCA 223 allowed that appeal, re-sentencing Bugmy to a non-parole period of five years with a balance of term of two years and six months.
Bugmy argued in the High Court that the Court of Criminal Appeal erred in allowing the DPP appeal without having held that the original sentence was manifestly inadequate and without having considered the exercise of its residual discretion to dismiss an appeal by the DPP. Bugmy also argued that it erred in holding that the extent to which his deprived background as an Indigenous person could be taken into account in sentencing diminished with time and repeat offending.
The High Court unanimously allowed his appeal, holding that as the Court of Criminal Appeal had not addressed the question of whether the original sentence was manifestly inadequate and had not considered its residual discretion to dismiss the DPP appeal, its authority to re-sentence Bugmy had not been enlivened. The High Court accordingly set aside the Court of Criminal Appeal order relating to the offence and remitted the DPP appeal.
The High Court held that the same sentencing principles apply irrespective of the identity of a particular offender or that person's membership of an ethnic or other group, something that's likely to be missed in coming mass media coverage.
The majority commented that
... the propositions stated in [R v Fernando (1992) 76 A Crim R 58] are particularly directed to the circumstances of offenders living in Aboriginal communities. Aboriginal Australians who live in an urban environment do not lose their Aboriginal identity and they, too, may be subject to the grave social difficulties discussed in Fernando. Nonetheless, the appellant's submission that courts should take judicial notice of the systemic background of deprivation of Aboriginal offenders cannot be accepted. It, too, is antithetical to individualised justice. Aboriginal Australians as a group are subject to social and economic disadvantage measured across a range of indices, but to recognise this is to say nothing about a particular Aboriginal offender. In any case in which it is sought to rely on an offender's background of deprivation in mitigation of sentence, it is necessary to point to material tending to establish that background.
It will be recalled that in the Court of Criminal Appeal the prosecution submitted that the evidence of the appellant's deprived background lost much of its force when viewed against the background of his previous offences. On the hearing of the appeal in this Court the Director did not maintain that submission. The Director acknowledges that the effects of profound deprivation do not diminish over time and he submits that they are to be given full weight in the determination of the appropriate sentence in every case.
The Director's submission should be accepted..
Because the effects of profound childhood deprivation do not diminish with the passage of time and repeated offending, it is right to speak of giving "full weight" to an offender's deprived background in every sentencing decision. However, this is not to suggest, as the appellant's submissions were apt to do, that an offender's deprived background has the same (mitigatory) relevance for all of the purposes of punishment. Giving weight to the conflicting purposes of punishment is what makes the exercise of the discretion so difficult[66]. An offender's childhood exposure to extreme violence and alcohol abuse may explain the offender's recourse to violence when frustrated such that the offender's moral culpability for the inability to control that impulse may be substantially reduced. However, the inability to control the violent response to frustration may increase the importance of protecting the community from the offender.The Court held that the effects upon an offender of profound deprivation do not diminish over time and should be given full weight when sentencing the offender. Importantly, those effects do not necessarily serve to mitigate an offender's sentence given the conflicting purposes of imprisonment (such as rehabilitation and personal and general deterrence) that must be balanced in each specific case.
That is consistent with Munda v The State of Western Australia [2013] HCA 38, with the High Court, by majority, dismissed an appeal from State of Western Australia v Ernest Munda [2012] WASCA 164, a decision of the Court of Appeal of the Supreme Court of Western Australia. The latter had allowed an appeal against the original sentence imposed on Munda (for the manslaughter of his de facto partner) on the basis that it was manifestly inadequate.
Munda had pleaded guilty to manslaughter, being sentenced in the WA Supreme Court to a term of imprisonment of five years and three months, with a non-parole period of three years and three months. The sentencing judge took Munda's personal circumstances into consideration as a mitigating factor, noting that he was a "traditional Aboriginal man" who had been exposed to the negative influences of alcohol and family violence from a young age.
The Court of Appeal allowed the State's appeal against the sentence, resentencing Munda to seven years and nine months imprisonment (with Munda remaining eligible for parole).
Munda by special leave appealed to the High Court on the grounds that the Court of Appeal failed to correctly apply the principles concerning State appeals against sentence and that it failed to give proper regard to his antecedents and personal circumstances. A majority of the High Court upheld the Court of Appeal's decision that the original sentence was manifestly inadequate, holding that the same sentencing principles must be applied in every case, irrespective of an offender's identity or membership of an ethnic or other group. The Court indicated that it was relevant to take into consideration an offender's circumstances of severe social disadvantage.
It also held that the Court of Appeal did not err in not exercising residual discretion to refuse to allow the State's appeal.
A perspective on Bugmy is provided by 'Indigenising Sentencing? Bugmy v The Queen' by Thalia Anthony in (2013) 35(2) Sydney Law Review 451, with the Fernando Principles being discussed in the NSW Sentencing Council's 2009 'Fernando principles: the sentencing of Indigenous offenders in NSW' [PDF].Know the anatomy of a roof
Like many professions, the field of construction has its own lingo. Many homeowners needing a new roof usually find themselves in this situation due to unfavorable circumstances, like a leaky or damaged roof after a storm.
The need for attention to this type of circumstance is usually urgent. In other cases, homeowners have the opportunity to research and shop around, to find the perfect roof for their new or existing home. Having a fundamental understanding of basic roofing terminology, systems and the standard for installation practice, can empower the homeowner with the ability to be certain of their product and contractor choices.
Here’s some roofing terminology that every homeowner should know:
A square: Roofers typically don’t measure using “square feet.” Instead, when discussing the size of your project, they will typically refer to it as “such and such squares.” A square is the basic unit of measurement for most roofing contractors, and it is the equivalent of a 10-foot by 10-foot area. //()

In the 1960s, his play The Beard became a huge cause when it was repeatedly censored in San Francisco and Los Angeles. The play was eventually moved to New York where McClure won an Obie Award as its author. The play was also cited by notable playwright Sam Shepard as an important precursor to his work which radically transformed the theater in the 1970s and 1980s.
In the early 1970s, McClure was one of the first writers of interest to both artists and scientists. McClure’s work has been cited by a variety of leading scientific thinkers, i.e., Francis Crick who received a Nobel for discovery of DNA.

Tom Holland Might Make Cameos To Sony And Vice Versa
Tom Holland should make offer an interesting addition to the Spider Verse where he is that sincere Peter parker that gets to interact with the Venom. Not to forget the venom once had Spiderman as his host !
Sony Will Get Better Script
If Marvel even though secretly is any which way involved in the Venom movie then SOny might as well break its curse of bad spider verse plans. If they get the better script and Marvel gets to keep the character, the fans are in for a blast. Also Tom Hardy will be an awesome Venom !
We Get To Retain Spiderman In MCU For Future Films
If Sony continues to expand it’s projects and somehow justified it’s timeline then we get better view of films in the future. Sony might renew it’s contract with Marvel. This means that we will also get more of Tom Holland’s Spider Man after the similar events of Venom movie.
More Spark To Phase 4
Many Actors Have Ended Their Contract With Marvel; after the second Infinity War movie. Spiderman without a doubt still a beloved character that makes it out of Phase 3. If we see full creative control then we might see cameos of likes of Doctor Strange, Carnage, Deadpool etc in phase 4 movies given that Spiderman universe is still unexplored in the MCU.

Not all foods are equal as fuels. It takes a little more thought and exploration to work which fuels are best; you have to make sure you put petrol in your petrol car, rather than diesel, and it is the same for your body. In this ketosis series, we’re going to be discussing the different types of fuel that our bodies use to operate; which fuel source is the most efficient; and how we can induce, maintain, and identify the different energy states within our bodies, and what the benefits are of each.
We can induce ketosis via our diet, called nutritional ketosis, by eating a very high-fat, very low-carbohydrate, moderate-protein diet. This puts our bodies into fat burning mode; the resultant effects including weight loss and enhanced mental and physical performance.
The cells of your body can run from sugars (from carbohydrates) or ketone bodies (from fats). Throughout our evolutionary history, we ate a fat-based, ketogenic diet; a diet that promotes our bodies to run from fats as the primary fuel source, rather than carbohydrates. Ketosis can be a transient state, or can be sustained for long periods of time i.e. weeks or months.1 In the modern day, as a result of cooking and food processing techniques, the predominant fuel that is powering people’s bodies is sugar. Cereal, porridge, or toast for breakfast; sandwiches, grains, pulses, and potatoes common in lunches and dinner; and all often accompanied by sugary drinks. Regardless of whether we should include carbohydrates in our diets, we eat WAY too many!
“There are essential amino acids and essential fatty acids, but there is no such thing as an essential carbohydrate”. Richard K Bernstein, M.D1
Carbohydrate rant over, back to ketosis!
Our bodies switch to using ketones as fuel in a state of starvation – not having eaten – to conserve the precious stores of glucose. This clever switch provides a very efficient fuel for the brain and prevents the breakdown of muscles for the formation of glucose; if the body needs to, it can convert muscles, which are made from protein, into glucose via a process called gluconeogenesis.
The ketogenic diet is the standard of treatment for drug-resistant epilepsy, and is used to control seizures. As the early epilepsy researchers found, the ketogenic diet mimics the metabolic and physiological benefits of fasting.2 This is mediated by carbohydrate restriction: low glucose, low insulin, and high ketone bodies. The ketogenic diet lowers insulin, which triggers a lot of physiological processes, including ketogenesis, which is neuroprotective.2, 3
There are two types of ketosis. Nutritional ketosis is induced as a result of prolonged carbohydrate restriction, and can mimic many of the metabolic states of fasting; this can be maintained indefinitely, unlike fasting. Starvation-induced ketosis is induced if we stop eating or severely limit carbohydrate intake. Our body mobilises fat stores for energy from dietary fat or our adipose tissues, which are our fat stores. These are metabolised (broken down) in the liver and converted to the ketone bodies, beta-hydroxybutyrate and aceto-acetate. These ketone bodies are alternative energy sources that are more efficient than sugars. As your brain becomes adapted to ketones, your thinking and physiological processes are maintained and enhanced.
Let’s think of our metabolism as a fire that burns to keep us going. There’s only so much wood we can fit into the fire at any time, so we need to choose the most efficient fuel that can keep us going the longest. Eating sugar, or sugary foods, is akin to putting kindling on the fire; it will burn brightly, but for a brief time.
- Starchy foods (rice, beans, grains) are like twigs.
- Potatoes, pasta, and cereal are like crumpled paper.
- Alcohol and sweetened drinks are like petrol.
Fats (ketones), on the other hand, are like the logs; they take a while to get going, but once they’re burning they will do so intensely, and for a long time. You can real feel this once you’ve spent some time taking yourself in and out of ketosis and seeing the effects it has on your energy levels! Appetite suppressive effects and removal of sugar cravings means it becomes easy to fast for long periods at a time, the mental clarity is liberating and the weight-loss an added bonus (if that’s what you need). Furthermore, you can build muscle on ketosis! The protein sparing effects mean the weight loss is not mediated by muscle wasting, and the proportions of the diet mean you can eat meaningful amounts of protein to gain muscle. Think better, eat less, lose fat, and gain muscle. What’s not to love?
What Are the Benefits of Ketosis?
- Natural hunger and appetite control.
- Effortless weight loss and maintenance.
- Mental clarity
- Sounder, more restful sleep
- Normalized metabolic function
- Stabilized blood sugar and restored insulin sensitivity.
- Lower inflammation levels
- Lowered blood pressure
- Increased HDL (good) cholesterol
- Reduced triglycerides
- Lowered or eliminated small LDL particles (bad cholesterol).
- Ability to go twelve to twenty-four hours between meals.
- Use of stored body fat as a fuel source.
- Better fertility
- Prevention of traumatic brain injury.
- Increased sex drive
- Improved immune system
- Slowed aging due to reduction in free radical production.
- Improvements in blood chemistry.
How Do You Induce Ketosis?
We can induce ketosis via our diet, called nutritional ketosis, by eating a very high-fat, very low-carbohydrate, moderate-protein diet. This puts our bodies into fat burning mode; the resultant effects including weight loss and enhanced mental and physical performance. Nutritional ketosis can take 24-48 hours to induce, but with ketone-forming supplementation, for example the medium chain triglyceride (MCT) oils added to buttery coffee, ketosis can be achieved in 10-15 minutes. Starvation-level ketosis, which would take a week to achieve nutritionally, can be achieved in 10 minutes with the most potent form of ketone supplements, ketone esters.
Jimmy Moore, author of the book Keto Clarity, has a helpful way of remembering the ground rules:
Keep carbs low.
Eat more fat.
Test ketones often.
Overdoing protein is bad.4
MCT oil: the golden boy of ketosis!
MCT’s are saturated fats, whose medium chain length allows them to be absorbed by your body and used almost completely as energy, by being converted into ketone bodies. This means that they are not stored as fat, unlike other fats sources.5 When switching to a ketogenic diet, adding MCT oil to your coffee, tea, and food can rapidly decrease the time it takes your body to become fat adapted, and the time it takes you to enter ketosis. Be careful though! Start with a small amount (1 tbsp in one sitting) and work your way up – too much too quickly can result as something people refer to as disaster pants! If the MCT oil is taken with a meal, with protein and fibre, to slow down gastric transit time and gastric emptying, it can be tolerated better.
It takes a couple of weeks to become ‘fat-adapted’; that is, to upregulate the expression of genes involved with fat metabolism. In other words for your body to sense that you are eating more fat, to read the machine-building blueprints in your DNA, and to build the machines that are used to digest, process and convert the fats you eat into ketones, which are then burned as fuel.
If you’re looking for the next step in your dietary experimentation then ketosis is the way forward – or if you’re looking for more energy, to lose weight, have better performance stamina, or improve your cognition. It’s almost hard to believe that something so simple as a specifically organised diet can have so many benefits, with no downsides (well, maybe the mild ketosis breath!), but with a little more thought it makes sense. Our ancestors evolved with a ketogenic diet, and we are born in ketosis. Maybe it works so well because that’s how our bodies are evolutionary meant to operate? Stay tuned for Part 2.

- 3 VisitorsI dearly love my children. They are all grown and have children of their own, some of whom are also adults now. I have always wanted to be a woman who had an open heart and listening ears, so that others are free to speak to me about their personal concerns. That especially applies to members of my family.
When my husband and I married many years ago, our wedding coincided with health problems in my parents. We decided that we didn’t want to burden my parents with any difficulties we had, because we didn’t want to add stress to Mom and Dad’s lives. Sometimes they didn’t understand some of our decisions because they didn’t know the background story, and that was all right. We talked about the happy times in our home, but when something negative came up, we kept it to ourselves.
Our children have problems from time to time, and they talk to us. We listen, but we can’t make their decisions for them. Sometimes they just need to talk and we want to be there for them. Maybe they made a wrong choice at some point in their lives, and they are suffering as a result. We can’t change the past, any more than we could stop them when they made the wrong choice in the first place. Most of the time we stand on the sidelines as a support system.
The most important thing we can do is pray for them. We do that on a daily basis, and sometimes through the night hours as well when we can’t sleep. God knows their needs far better than we do, and He alone is able to strengthen and support them in ways that even the most loving parents cannot.
I do have a problem of worrying about my kids, going over and over their situations in my mind and sometimes feeling ill because of the pressures that I put on myself. Lately I have been trying to relax and let them live their lives, make their decisions–right or wrong–and deal with the fallout or success, whatever it is. This is the decision I have made. It is a fine balance that we parents and grandparents walk, to be a support system, without crumpling under the stress of being supportive.
I can only pray that each one has trusted the Lord and has a right relationship with Him, regardless of circumstance.
“I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth.” III John 4

,” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Friday.While the Wii U will be compatible with previous Wii accessories and controllers, Nintendo will offer Wii U branded Wiimotes. But Nintendo didn’t just take some old Wiimotes and slap a “Wii U” logo on them. The new motion controllers are actually improved in many ways. Besides featuring built-in Motion Plus technology, the Wii U branded Wiimotes will have an external sync button. In the older controllers, players had to remove the battery cover in order to sync the controller with the console. The sync button is now conveniently located under the controller. The Wii U console itself will feature an external sync button at the front of the console, to make everything easier for players. Nintendo will launch the console with a slew of first party accessories, from Wiimotes and Nun-chuck controllers, to Pro controllers, console and controller stands, and even a screen protector for the GamePad. Source local_offer Nintendo wii u wii u accessory wiimote stars Further Reading Nintendo loses patent appeal, ordered to pay Nintendo was brainstorming about Switch when Naterman Yes finally. Thank u Nintendo for making the wii u as comfortable as possible. That’s why the wii u is superior to everything out now and everything out in the future. Btw this is my first time being the first post 🙂 Ikari-pt In what way this makes the wiiU more confortable or superior? Naterman Because now u don’t have to open up the back to click the sync button. It’s exteriorized now. And it’s a next gen console so clearly it’s superior Kav So, the little button that you need to press like… 3 times at year is now visible and maybe you can press it by accident? that is superior. NintendoMan :D Congrats for being the first person to post a comment. Do you want a cookie? Naterman Unless u have needle fingers, ull most likely NOT press it by accident. Besides, Haters gonna Hate Chips You were suppose to hold both [sync] buttons down at the same time instead of mashing them like an idiot. NavyBlueYoshi It would truly be far more superior if it was rechargeable, instead of Buying a third party rechargeable battery ._. Captain Potato …so Rayovac and Duracell are third parties? Would LOVE to see a game by either! “The Charging Games” or “Charge Wars” come to mind! LOL! Grodus @Captain_Potato It’s not Nintendo, or you. Hence, third party, Third parties aren’t just people who make games… PACMAN MAKE A NEW NUNCHUK WITH A BETTER JOYSTICK!!! PLEASE!!!! NINTENDO!!!! Wii U next gen Congrats man and yes i agree haters will always be around i say put them in a corner and keep going Kahhhhyle Nothing is WRONG with the current wii motes but I do think we need a redesign, built in rechargeable batteries, an analogue stick on the remote and an upgraded nunchuck with rumble and a gyroscope in it. THAT would be superior. This is a nice addition but nothing to write home about Ninjafish Nice! Too bad I own 6 wiimotes already -___- yay. Tobbe Me too Derpy “That seems a bit excessive” ;D Ninjafish 2 came with games (Wii Play and Skyward Sword lol). So now I have 6 XD Tobbe i have 2 that are cordeless between chuck and mote. Pretty good, coz i have been cut the cord in half of the chucks while boxing 🙁 and when i bought a second wii just to expriment on it i got one set of mote/chuck. But i will buy brand new when Wii U comes out. new and fresh. Here in sweden Wii u comes out 30 nov but i will be able to try it on the 4th november. i am exited TheFearless Firs…… Nah its not worth it Cugno the Swiss Dat nickname! NEIN! lover Remember this i will always thumb down your comments and remember who you start problems with next time boy Vaughn Chung Is this compatible with my Super Nintendo? Fireheart Ha ha very funny my friend very funny. Long live the SNES for real. Cubical_M SNES for LIFE!!! Chris Is that why they aren’t making games for it anymore? ceramicsaturn Not to be “that guy”, but my new wiimote I bought about three months ago with built in motion plus had the red sync button on the bottom of the remote (there’s a hole in the battery cover it pokes through). I doubt these are any different than the one I got before. And that was NOT marked with a Wii U branded box. Goose Came here to say the same thing. I think the Wiiudaily just copied this story from mynintendonews.com NintendoMan :D Its not these are just Wii U branded. Im guessing the Wii ones will be discontinued in 5 or 6 months. Kahhhhyle Actually the box is the only thing that says wii u. The remote itself the same in every way dubYA Stores where I live have had Wii Remotes with external sync buttons for several months. My friends have two of them, and when I bring over my old Wii Remote +, I always wish I didn’t have to take off the battery cover to play. when they come to my place, all they have to do is hit the button. I need to get up to date! theorangefish You just have to press 1&2 simultaneously to connect with wii’s that aren’t yours. EvanescentHero Yeah, there’s an option to temporarily connect Wii remotes that aren’t synced to your Wii in the menu that pops up when you hit the Home button. But to be fair, it’s not exactly obvious. I didn’t know about it for a while. nintendofreak They should have made a new wii mote like motion plus advanced or something like dat……or cordless nunchucks or something…not dat i dont like the idea of a out side sync button but im not gonnna buy a new controller just cuz of dat as long as my legend of zelda wii mote works Fireheart I would love to see a Wireless Nunchuck. It would be so much better than smacking myself with the wire as I get too into a game lol. PenguinGames Wireless or cordless nunchucks would be so amazing! I played Rayman Raving Rabbids 2 when I was small and when I was told to bring the Wii Mote and Nunchuck apart I’d do it real hard so the wire flung in my face. Ouch. Derpy We don’t need another Motion Plus variation. The Motion Plus/Wii Remote Plus works great. And we definitely do not need cordless nunchucks, lol, it’s just a bad idea. XD nintendofreak its good cuz d wires just get in the way when ur boxing, and stuff and plus it would look cooler Kirbymon123 I still dont know what the sync button does Kirbymon123 Oops wrong place to comment Kirbymon123 What does the sync button eve do?!?! Naterman Well yea but I’m a clumsy person that drops the nunchuk and the cord is always saving my fall lol. Cordless will be nice tho. And chargeable through the wiiu itself. And longer life with better Bluetooth connection cuz lately I’ve been playin ssbb and it randomly switches off so I have to take off the batteries and reconnect. All in all the wii u is looking to be flawless NaX Um why can’t Nov 18 be today :'( Finnishnintendofan Or nov 30th Fireheart I totally agree man I am tired of waiting to play the Wii U. I can’t wait for Nov 18 not just because I get to pick up my Wii U at GameStop, but I get to be part of the Wii U launch party at the Walmart I work for. It’s going to be an awesome day for sure. MyBodyIsReady same here but cant you try out the wii U in Best Buy? Brandon K. Wow, I all ready have a Wiimote and Nunchuk and personally have no plans on buying more accessories unless I’m forced. Which won’t happen. Derpy Wiimote Plus? fan NINTENDO Just played it at my local Gamestop. BEST DAMN CONSOLE.IN THE UNIVERSE. WHY THE FUCK DIDN’T I PRE O DER WHEN I HAD THE CHANCE D2K It’s just brilliant how Nintendo incorporated everything good about the Wii into the Wii U. Billy I fucking hate bestbuy, none of the stores around me have the demo kiosks. My heart is breaking with each phone call I make. EvanescentHero Check GameStops as well! ddr5 These changes are still lacking. What I really want to know is if they have an internal battery. I understand that the motion tech for the wii was really new and maybe even expensive but unless they add an internal battery to these new wiiu branded wii motes then they really should drop the price. Serious Sam Stone I assume thats why it’s been moved otherwise Nintendo would just re brand current stock. NintendoMan :D Do regular Wiimotes (the ones without motion plus) still work with the Wii U? I have 4 and i really hope I don’t have to buy new ones. Wii U “Past accessories will work with the wii u. Backwards compatibility with the wii and accessories” so yes they will function. 🙂 anthony Some games on wii u need advanced motion control!! Nintendoland some of the mini games require it!! I read it somewhere! mojojojo888 You can just buy the motion plus dongle for your wiimotes if you want, you can find them pretty cheap, and then you don’t have to buy new controllers. I think you can find them pretty cheap at tmart.com, I think like 9 or 10 bucks. Neonridr “But Nintendo didn’t just take some old Wiimotes and slap a “Wii U” logo on them. The new motion controllers are actually improved in many ways.” First off, aside from the box, do the actual wiimotes have a Wii U logo on them anywhere? And secondly, outside of the external sync button (which may be on the wiimotes with included motion plus already) what else changed on the remotes? They say many ways, but I can’t even count two things. Obviously they are an improved over the first generation wiimotes that had to have the external motion plus adapter hooked into them. But take the Zelda Skyward Sword Wiimote, what is the difference between these new remotes and that one? NintendoYOU Agreed. News is slow on this site… Has been for a while Wii U is next gen I can’t wait for the wii u to come out hurry wii u hurry!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Elite I am pretty sure this doesnt help most of us. The majority of us will not go out and spend $40 bucks on another wii mote when we already have 1-4 wii motes already… But its good that there is that change for anyone who doesn’t own a wii. Nintendominant just wtf is a WiiU Wiimote? can’t they call it “WiiUmote”? theorangefish There is NOTHING SUPERIOR to the Goldmote!!!!!!!!!!!! Joesatmoes i hav owned a wii for 4 whole years. I took me until about 2 months ago 4 me to even KNOW ther was a sync butyon! ive had to go through the hassel of reconnecting both controllers evry time i used it with my bro. No longer shall i hav to worry about that james braselton come down you have 24 days 12 hours left Grodus Not to be that guy that, every time you see his comment, you dislike, then read, but, is that it? Nothing, like, WiiMotion++, or, Ruble Feature, or rechargeable batteries or anything? I mean, I don’t mean to be a downer, but, yippee, I don’t need to open the battery cover, that *doesn’t* need t be screwed out, one more time in my life? Plus, it sound like, from other comments, you’d have to use a needle anyway! it would be a lot more convenient just to open the case then! Gee, you really broke your backs with this, Nintendo. Good effort… Br Nice idea but like many phones these days i also would have loved the ability to sync by nudging the console with the wiimote and skip the button fiddling SteampunkJedi (3DS FC: 5284-2360-9145) I think I’ve used the sync button perhaps twice in the several years I’ve had the Wii. So that feature isn’t too groundbreaking for me. It’s nice though. But in my opinion, the best feature the new remotes have is the built-in Motion Plus. Mils For what it’s worth – I picked up a WiiU branded Wiimote and the sync button is not external – it’s exactly the same as before, under the battery cover. javier! hey. that isn’t much of a difference. anyways using my wii u internet browser! works amazing!.

Susquehanna’s women’s basketball lost to Moravian 86-42 on Saturday, despite a revitalized scoring effort in the second half. Crusader Gina Palazzi managed to land double figures, and teammate Shannon Grunwald followed closely behind with nine points and 10 rebounds. The attempt to get ahead, however, was swiftly lost after Moravian took a run that launched the team to 77-38. The Greyhounds nabbed a 40-plus lead by the end, winning 86-42.
Ranck at home in both field and classroom
Senior Jessica Ranck has found her calling as a biology-secondary education major, a passion only rivaled by her love of being a thrower for track and field.
“You can’t beat that feeling of having the whole team come together and cheering and having them cheer for you,” Ranck said. “Being an athlete at Susquehanna means you are held to a higher standard, but it’s so worth it! It keeps you focused and healthy, both mentally and physically. You build bonds that you don’t create in any other club or organization on campus, and they’re a constant support system that proves to be invaluable in college.”
Ranck said that her inspiration to become a thrower was her older brother. She joined her high school track team, and has been throwing since, a decision she has not regretted.
“I can’t imagine my college career without my team,” she said.

What happens is that it will work fine for several hours, and then eventually I won't be able to connect to the web interface or SSH into it. The router still works though, as in I can connect to the web via both wired and wireless connections. I have to power cycle to fix this. What seems really strange though is that sometimes I'll still be able to access the Transmission gui, which will tell me under each active transfer that there is an error (the directory is unavailable).
I've tried several different Tomato builds including:

The download directory is set to /opt/Downloads. I've tried using the built-in Transmission client (on applicable builds) as well as the Transmission installed through optware.

Ok on to fun news, Daisy is being fixed next week and GEEZUSS its expensive to have a dog, she's so picky she will only eat the "expensive" dog food @10 for a 12 day supply. I guess its a bit of the husbands fault too for buying her the Royal Canine $12 a bag specialty Chihuahua food. It does say its good for her heart and health and the poor thing has been through an awful lot in her short life. Geez I love that little mutt. The vet asked if we would be taking the option of the cone for her after her surgery (who knew it was an option?) they said some people opt to not have the cone but he said that if she licks her wounds open she will have to go back to have it re-closed at a cost of $45. So we opted for the $11 cone. SHE IS NOT GOING TO LIKE THAT! But you can all be sure that I will certainly post pictures of how silly she looks like a good dog mommy.

Ask your vet about the right food for Daisy, whatever it says on the package is simply marketing remember.
When we had Cecil fixed, the vet gave him this pain buster thingy that kept him medicated for the first 12 hours or so and this was great because it helped him to stay sleepy and not run around right after surgery. It also helped me to not feel he was in pain that was indirectly because of me. I don't know if they use these routinely now, but you might want to ask your vet about this too. Tell Daisy that if she is a good girl about the collar that she and mommy will go shopping when she feels better and buy a her a new outfit. It COULD help!
I am having Rickey finally fixed next month (Im such a bad mom for not having it done already!) Its going to be traumatic for me I think. Hope that Daisy does well..cant wait for pictures of her with the cone!!
Awwwww, poor lil Daisy. She will so not like that collar thing. And she will look pitiful. And funny. Can we get a picture posted?
That is good news about your husband. I know both of you are relieved.
Anne- have you ever heard of neuticals? Do a google search and see if they are right for him hehe.
I hope Daisy gets along well with getting fixed. She shouldn't have the cone on for long. And soon she will be back to herself. I so want a dog.
I think those cones are simply a money-making scam for vets.
Thank goodness your hubby is ok. Good work nursing him!In the Tradition of Laurel and Hardy,
Tom Dougherty Takes a Partner
Tom bring us up to date with his career in a conversation at the Monte Carlo International Festival of Circus
For over thirty years Tom Dougherty was a solo clown. After graduating from Ringling’s Clown College, his earliest professional clowning was accomplished in an early stint with the Blue Unit, followed by another with the Big Apple Circus and then two engagements with Ringling’s Gold Unit and finally, back to the big show in 2008 in a production called Over the Top in which he was featured and when everything changed. Also in the cast of that show were a pair of diminutive clowns billed as Pepe (Silva Rodriguez) and Royo (Eric Sanchez). According to the show’s loosely knit plot Pepe and Royo were the assistants to the ringmaster Chuck Wagner, and whenever Tom managed to get his hands on the ringmaster’s top hat, he would bring on the silly acts. Pepe and Royo would then try to steal it away from him and give it back to Chuck who would then bring on the serious acts.
That all worked fine until the middle of the tour when Royo suddenly quit, leaving something of a hole in the plotting that somehow had to be fixed. In an act of self-preservation, Tom and Pepe put their heads together to figure how to make it work with one less character. In talking together the two seemingly disparate clowns realized that they actually had a lot in common: a similar approach and love of clowning and comedy, which Tom points out, is “mostly Laurel and Hardy,” which they both love.
By the end of the tour, it was becoming clear that management was changing the direction Ringling was about to go, and there would be no lead clown spot anymore. Necessity was about to spawn invention. “As we wondered about what to do next,” Tom recalls. “Pepe proposed the idea of a partnership.”
Tom recalls thinking that although he had already done solo clowning for so long and had done a lot in that field, there was still more he could do artistically within a partnership. As it turned out Pepe was booked into a prestigious festival in Spain that introduced new talent that hadn’t been seen in Europe before. Since that description fi the new partnership perfectly, they took the spot as a duo, and thus began a period of experimentation, exploration and discovery that continues to this day.
Pepe began his career in the circus with what was the first social circus in the world, Los Muchachos, founded by a Spanish priest. He eventually attended the Fratellini school in France as a wire walker and worked with both Annie Fratellini and Pierre Etaix learning the circus business from the ground up. That experience, he says had a profound effect on him, bringing him to a deep understanding and appreciation of the collaborative nature of circus.
What makes this new partnership work is that they share a lot of ideas about comedy, and especially they share a love of the clown despite coming from two different worlds and having different ways of seeing things. “It has taken a little time to find ourselves as a partnership,” Tom readily admits. Five years into their collaboration, it’s still an ongoing process of finding their synchronicity. “We have the same heart and love,” they agree, “but we come from different approaches and how to do the comedy.”
In the beginning they took all of Tom’s routines that he had developed with Ringling, the music routine, the baby routine and struggled to make them into duo routines. “At first it was like using training wheels, but then we found our connections, and we started to develop some new material,” Tom explains. The music routine, for instance, became very different from what it had been as a solo routine. “It truly became a duo routine. Now we have new material that we are developing that comes from us as a team.”
Following their debut in Spain the new duo received a contract for a full season with the French circus Artlette Gruss, a period Tom describes as one of “groping” to find their way. Pepe had often worked with a partner before teaming up with Tom, whom he regards as a master clown, but of the experience he says, “I learned a lot from the process. It took time to find our way,” but slowly they came to a working relationship that Pepe refers to as “making songs.”
For Tom the experience was a bit more difficult. “As a solo clown,” he explains, “you have a very different kind of focus which is just you and your relationship with the audience. It’s just that direct. With a partner you have a relationship with your partner and also with the audience. So it’s definitely an adjustment because my instincts were developed from thirty years of doing solo. I would hit a moment and turn to do something that was instinctive, and I would find I was excluding my partner and I had to go, ‘wait a minute that is not right.’ It’s not two solo clowns; it’s two clowns coming together as one unit. That’s what makes it, for me, so beautiful. That was the hardest adjustment, developing a trusting relationship. I was sure about my instinct, but I was not sure about our instincts. That took a little bit of time. Now we’re getting there.
“Our work together in the long range of things is really a very short time. It’s only been five years. Arlette gave us a full season but we eventually decided that we weren’t as interested in full seasons and started doing festivals. But there would be big gaps between gigs. We would do Krone in February and then I would go back to America, and he would go back to Paris, and I wouldn’t see him again until August. So when Europa Park offered us a job, we realized it was just what we needed.”
In assessing his learning curve insofar as becoming a clown is concerned, Tom insists he wouldn’t be performing in the Monte Carlo if it weren’t for Clown College and Ringling Bros and Barnum & Bailey. “One of the greatest things about Ringling was working every day, getting sometimes two or three chances a day in front of an audience to learn how to be a clown. In Europa Park we were there six days a week. We did a stage show in the fall, and then in the winter we did the circus, three shows a day, every day, every week. So just that repetition was what we needed. That’s why we’ve done Europa Park the last two years and it has been a big help in getting the foundation we needed to work together smoothly.”
Europa Park is in Germany, near Strasbourg, France. It’s a theme park, the second most popular park in Europe after Disneyland. The Mack family who owns the park builds roller coasters and have built many of the ones in use here in America. Unlike an American park Europa stays open even when it’s cold. It has three seasons basically, the first starting In March and running through November. Around September, it switches over from summer to Halloween, which is getting more and more popular in Germany. The Germans have embraced the holiday. The Halloween season is probably the park’s most well attended. They hire an American man who comes over and sets up the haunted houses. After Halloween the park is closed for two weeks and then reopens with the winter season and, as is a tradition in Europe, it includes a winter circus. They bring a tent in. Joseph Bouglione from Cirque d’Hiver comes in and directs the show, so of course it’s a quality production.
Ian Jenkins, the entertainment director of the park was an ex-figure skater, who knows how to handle artists. “He would hire you and say, ‘Here’s your stage; go do your thing, boys. Go be funny.’ Then he would leave us alone, trusting that we were going to put some good twenty minutes on that stage. It was wonderful to have that trust, because then we could try new things, discovering for instance that the audience laughs at this but not at that. So we would take out what didn’t work and all of a sudden after a few weeks we had a polished gem.”
A couple of the routines that Tom and Pepe were performing in Monte Carlo came from their collaboration in Europa Park. The two agree it is a wonderful place to work. They will be going back again later this year.
In addition to learning how to work as partners, the two clowns are also discovering the differences in audiences around the world and what they find funny and how they react to comedy. “There are some images that Americans have in their mind to laugh at right away,” Tom has observed. “Americans are more free with their laughter. They want to play more. The French are more reserved, but they appreciate the artistry involved in clowning. We did a real carpet tramp, sensitive routine in Arlette Gruss. It was the first time I put on my tramp outfit since 1982 when I first left Ringling. It was a beautiful opportunity. To do it in a circus was special. The character is very special to me. I felt we don’t see that character in a circus anymore. So I created a very poetic routine, and the French loved it. Then we took it over to a festival in Budapest, Hungary, and they hated it. That was our first education in discovering that not all images are universally accepted. We died a horrible death on that one in Hungary. You learn and pick up the pieces. The German audiences are a little more vocal than the French audiences, but they like to mess with you a little bit. Spanish audiences are similar to those in America, in their love of life. Spanish people are full of life and love to play. They see the clown and they want to play with you.
“We played a circus in Madrid, Spain, in a modern circus building built in 2008. It was a beautiful show and audiences enjoyed it. David Larible came in and directed it. He is a great director. Of course being a clown, I have learned that in the circus the clown is often an after thought. Managers don’t always appreciate that the clown is delicate, that he needs time to adjust to the environment, to the show itself. Often times we are changing things to fit in where we are. David understood that and featured the clowns beautifully so we were fortunate to work with him.”
Following that train of thought, Tom pursues the idea that clowning is a delicate art form. Timing has to be just right. That is why Tom and Pepe brought their own technician to Monte Carlo, to make sure the timing of the technical aspects of their bits was just right. They are fully aware that the people who stage the Monte Carlo festival put together two entire three-hour circuses in three days, and subtle things can go wrong which may not bother other acts but they do for clowns. “We are trying to do our best to keep it as easy for all the people involved technically and still get what we need, when we need it,” Tom explains.
Here his partner Pepe interjects, “I think it is very important to say that clowning is a delicate job because people think it’s all noise, but a good clown is more delicate.”
“With the clown,” Tom picks up the thread, “you’re dealing with a different set of emotions than the thrill of watching a juggler or a high wire artist. There is an emotional response to that, but with the clown you’re dealing with something more human, something with the heart. We are that connection between the people and the impossible things being presented in the ring. We are the humanity between the two and it’s a hard thing to do. It’s hard because the circus is a very different environment than the theatre. Or the street. That’s where you mainly find clowns. The circus nowadays is fast, fast, fast. It used to be the European clown, for instance the Fratellinis, would go out and do fifteen or twenty minutes. You come here, and it’s ‘get in and get out.’”
“When I was with Los Muchachos, I worked with Charlie Rivel,” Pepe recalls. “He would be in the ring for twenty minutes. The kids did the first part of the show, and he did the second half for almost as long.”
Another thing that is changing about clowning in the circus is that circus producers are bringing in comics or comedy magicians who are slowly replacing the clown. “We were in a show where they had a wonderful comic,” Tom recalls, “and it was very difficult to balance his comedy with our clowning.”
The other inescapable fact is that the audience is changing. Ringling has been trying very hard in recent years to adjust the show to fit the changing tastes which are changing so rapidly these days. In addition there is a loss of innocence in our society now. Clowns who are symbols of innocence and joy are having to compete with humor that seems to be getting more biting.
In contrast, Tom says, “We are trying to preserve a sense of innocence and tradition.” The first reprise that they tried in Monte Carlo was from Fratellini’s old entrée “Trying to get a job at the circus.” “We adjusted it a little bit for the times,” Tom points out. “It is a throwback to the traditional clown entrée. We are proud of it. Whether or not it works, we’ll see.
“A lot of clown work is not tangible,” Tom observes. “A juggler’s act doesn’t change no matter the audience; his act is not built on audience interaction no matter its size. It’s built on his skill. A clown’s skill is creating interaction.“
Pepe adds a final note. “I like to think we are the artisans, artisans of joy. We need to keep going and connecting with the past because if we don’t, something essential will be lost.”This oppose efforts to change self-defense advocates call “victim disarmament policies.”
Within days of the rampage by Seung-Hui Cho that left 32 people dead and 17 others wounded, an ambitious movement originally called Students for Concealed Carry on Campus was founded. The idea startled anti-gunners whose only response to the mayhem in West Ambler Johnston and Norris Halls was to demand more gun control.
In the decade since the April 16, 2007 attack, the student group has evolved to become Students for Concealed Carry. They created the “Empty Holster” protest movement to underscore the erroneous notion that disarming the wrong people makes them safer.
That much was evident last Nov. 28 when a Somali refugee named Abdul Razak Ali Artan rammed a car into a group of students at Ohio State University and savagely attacked his victims with a knife. By sheer coincidence, an armed campus police officer was nearby due to reported chemical leak in one of the buildings and he fatally shot the would-be terrorist.
Much has been written about the pros and cons of concealed carry on campus; lots of emotion, plenty of conjecture.
According to the SCC website, the organization has some 43,000 members, and they are scattered across the 50 states. They fought a campus ban in Colorado and have pushed for concealed carry on campus laws in other states.
By no small coincidence, there is currently a case pending in Seattle regarding a shooting at the University of Washington in January during a raucous protest against an appearance by Milo Yiannopoulos. A felony assault charge has been filed against the shooter, a woman whose attorney is arguing she fired in defense of her husband.
The UW is among the majority of campuses that prohibit firearms, though that didn’t prevent the 2007 slaying of Rebecca Greigo by a stalker ex-boyfriend against whom she had a protection order, but it had not been served. Jonathan Rowan was an alien who had overstayed his visa by about ten years, was being sought by immigration authorities and he was armed with a stolen handgun, so there had been no background check.
Whether with a firearm, knife or speeding car or any combination, violent attacks on or off campus don’t happen on a pre-arranged schedule. Neither do killers call ahead to let you know they’re coming.
But for those who are present if and when an attack occurs, proponents of campus carry contend that the intended victims should at least have a chance to fight back.
If that becomes part of the discussion this weekend, and beyond, then self-defense advocates have made some progress.

Grab The Football Tickets And Leave The Gun At Home!The New York Times Style Magazine of March 8, 2015 had a cover story, “The Rediscovered Genius of Jean-Michel Basquiat” (then the title of the article was “The Unknown Notebooks of Jean-Michel Basquiat”). Those books, at that time soon to be on display at the Brooklyn Museum, were from 1980 to 1981 (some of his breakthrough years) and contain poetry, notes, sketches, scenarios, lyrics, mantras, and other things that would become raw material for Basquiat’s later art. The article's author discussed the ways Basquiat worked out his ideas and recorded things he learned and observed.
The piece reminded me of another article published almost exactly 28 years earlier, “The Lost Notebooks of Leonardo DaVinci,” in the March 3, 1967 issue of Life magazine. I was in fourth grade, loved science, and felt inspired by this article to pursue science. (Mom probably checked out the issue from our local library.) In the books, rediscovered after being miscatalogued for over a century in a Madrid library, DaVinci sketched ideas for machines and sculptures, explained in his famous mirror-image handwriting. kept many of his sketches and ideas.
THEN, these articles lead me to brainstorm the name of a book that I had given away to a book fair but regretted doing so. The author had kept journals since her youth and had volumes of her words and sketches. The book was a call to readers to set down their own observations and discoveries in their own notebooks, with her own pages (and her life) as examples. I couldn’t remember the author or title. Doing a search for “journals” and “journaling” resulted in many, many other books but not this one. Finally I remembered that I’d purchased the book at a Nature Company store and that gave me a clue for a successful search: A Trail Through Leaves: The Journal as a Path to Place, by Hannah Hinchman (W.W. Norton & Co., 1999). It’s a beautiful book; she is a very talented author and artist.
When I was a kid, I wanted to keep a journal. I also loved the Henry Reed series of young adult novels that featured the eponymous character recording his adventures in a journal (not a diary, the character explained, which he thought girly). I didn’t get very far in journaling because of a contradictory impulse: self-consciously, I wanted to write it well, with a good beginning (which I could never get right). I seemed to be aiming to write my life's story---all eleven years of it. Yet I didn't want anyone to read my private thoughts.
Later, when I was in college and then divinity school, I thought I’d make a journaling effort again---but once again, I didn’t want anyone else to read it, and also, I felt that my thoughts were foolish and self-involved. This time, I typed the entries, which had the benefit of on-the-spot free-writing.
My main effort at keeping a journal was, instead, a file of index cards! I jotted or typed quotations, bible verses, theological explanations, and notes on numerous theological subjects as I, in the grip of a tenacious bout of depression, got through my coursework. I was trying to hold onto the Lord as best as I could, to believe amidst my blues, and these notes helped me focus on the God upon whom I counted for all my well-being.
My father began recording daily observations in diary books, which I kept and have stored safely. Usually his jottings were the day's weather, his blood sugar readings, how my mother was feeling, and things that I (their only child) was up to. He made observations in the morning and evening. The last entry, September 16, 1999, had only his morning entry; he died at around suppertime that day.
Over the years, I’ve carried numerous spiral-bound notebooks for recording thoughts. These have been very helpful as I work on writing projects: stray thoughts and verbal images may be useful later. These aren’t particularly important notebooks to me later, nor particularly private, but I keep them on hand and have a stack in my office.
Beginning in the 00s, blogging became my substitute for keeping a journal notebook. I no longer wince when rereading my own ruminations. So I haven’t minded during the past few years posting my various thoughts and discoveries in what eventually became six different sites (this one the most regularly updated now). Four of those sites became a personal Bible study project that got out of hand, though I was happy rather than despairing when I worked on it. A benefit of on-line personal writing is that I can include website links to whom I may want to return again.
Still, the attraction of a tangible notebook---a hardback book or a solid ring notebook---still holds great appeal. The other day, I went to Office Depot and purchased three journal-books to begin keeping track of random things. I know myself well enough to realize I won’t keep them on a daily basis, but it would satisfy an old, small dream to keep track of events and observations, through words and drawings.

Life begins are conception and stem cell research contradict one another completely in the mind of conservative, pro-life people like McCain.
- "I'm proud of the people who come to our rallies" ... oh yea? The ones who chant "kill, kill, kill", you support them too?
- For McCain to say Sarah Palin's excited women and brought them a step forward is just absolutely disgusting to me. Talk about a big, whopping lie! Most women are insulted. People with Sarah Palin's qualification have never been involved before because they're not qualified! New doesn't mean different and new to the scene definitely doesn't mean better.
- At one point McCain said "hundreds" and then corrected himself it to "billions" ... I wasn't going to point that out, but McCain did that more than one and, man, that's a big difference!
- I cannot believe McCain said that most of Superior Court decisions were wrong. How insulting to those judges who have achieved such standing and the presidents that suggested they be put in those positions! Then he said that such decisions should rest in the hands of the states - uh, why are we the "united" states at all then???
- Anyone that supports Roe V Wade automatically makes them unqualified for sitting on the Superior Court?! Wow! That's terrifying. Though I do not believe that is a decision I could ever personally make, I will never, ever, ever be okay with some older, white man thinking he can take that option away from every woman no matter what the circumstances. Uh! And for Obama to then smooth it over by saying that he feels abortion is a very difficult issue and a moral issue ... that the constitution has a "right to privacy" in it. I liked that!! That our "rights" should not be put up to public vote. Oh man, he won me right there if he hadn't already. Personal, private choices should remain that - our own decisions, not forced ones due to a narrow minded, conservative weighed judges and if that's "mainstream America" - well, mainstream isn't everyone's current in life!
- Personally I also really liked Obama's idea of community work required for students - I think it is GREAT! My rescue experience has gotten me so far in life, made me very mature & aware. Also, I cannot imagine my life without my time in Belize, even for how short it was. That time in my life will forever be greatly valued and on my mind.
- And my, wouldn't it be great to get rid of bad teachers!? They're such a detriment to not only the education of our children, but their self-esteem and self value. Whether they feel bad for constantly doing poorly in a class due to poor teaching practices, unhelpful, non-hands-on educators or those belittling teachers. They affect our whole lives greatly!
- Oh, and I also liked how McCain practically jumped Obama
Afterwards, NBC had a little mini poll/interview with 4 independent voters, 1 republican and 1 democrat. When asked to answer honestly, 3 people raised their hands saying they knew people who would not vote for Obama due to his race. When asked if they knew anyone that would not vote for McCain due to Sarah Palin ... every single one of those six people raised their hand! That says something right there, I think. Also, they were very impressed that Obama contained his temperament and discipline - I have to agree with that. I don't want a president that gets heated, over-worked and angry representing me ... let alone making decisions in a time of crisis.
Post debate I checked out the polls on AOL and found this comment along the lines of how stupid Democrats must be and the women who are doing anything but falling to their knees in worship before McCain because of how awful Obama was to Hillary Clinton. What?! I felt compelled to comment as well: Fastcat121, as a woman, I wouldn't vote for McCain strictly for the embarrassment to my gender that is Sarah Palin and for the undeniable factor that he chose her because she IS a woman ... as if that would mean I'd automatically vote for her strictly because we both have vag...s - a family she can't control (pregnant, unwed teen when she's so conservative, a soon-to-be-son-in-law that dropped out of highschool when Palin said before that there's no reason to not work through whatever and get your high school diploma), a brain she is being fed lines to follow (yay for setting women back so far) and the lack of a backbone to stick up for herself, her values and women as a whole is so SAD!—
“If you want to live a happy life, tie it to a goal, not to people or things.”

Don’t be upset and caught up with things or people
you cannot change.
Instead move on, let go and concentrate

Things that enhance your life.
You deserve to be HAPPY….

Dh Poem Cont..................... - Poem by Sylvia Loven Carter
It is your home I don't pay bills?
Do you have to take my pride is this the way
you want me to go. God know I would not do
you like that. But I learned that early in life
What hurts me is most is What I'm doing to you
Or were you always this disrespectful
to your men.
Our love seems to go up and down to me
We got to come to a decision you've got a son
the way you treat me is the way he'll
expect women to treat him it's okay cause mom
use to talk to her old boyfriends like this
I am not going to let him believe this.

'no to mining' po ba talaga ang sinusulong ng mga taong against the mining act of 1995?
paano naman po ang issue ng environmental justice? dahil kailangan nating mga tao ang natural resources para sa ating kaginhawaan, sisirain na natin ang mga ito?
it's good to have statistics, yet it's also good to see the real picture of what we say as 'responsible mining'. salamat po sa blog na to,
Hi, salamat sa comments. Re environmental justice, tingnan nyo na lang po ang sinulat ko about the case of Rio Tuba Nickel Mining in southern Palawan. Wala hong nasisira, walang erosion, walang mine tailings leak to the river. May 2 pictures akong pinakita doon -- Pasig River, sobrang dami ng eroded soil dinadala, wala namang mining. Rio Tuba River, may mining pero walang bahid ng soil erosion.
So if statistics don't convince you, perhaps actual photos can. Salamat ulit,Additional Information Tags (0) Reviews (0) Questions (0)

This is part of Target’s strategy to get you to spend more time in their stores. In addition to playing upbeat music (to get your heart racing and encourage you to spend), the retailer wants to offer a boutique experience at a lower price point that’s focused on lines that are actually cute. A New Day, a women’s brand that is meant to be mixed and matched, and Goodfellow & Co., a menswear brand that provides modern takes on clothing and accessories, are currently. Project 62, a chic home offering, and JoyLab, an activewear line that’s “fitness-meets-fashion-and-function,” hit shelves in October. Seems like Target is getting fashion-y AF.
According to the Wall Street Journal, Target took a look at the brands that were performing the best and began to phase out the ones that weren't (like Merona and Mossimo) to create niche labels that speak to customers’ need to feel special. “People are looking for something that is more curated and meaningful to their specific lifestyle,” said Mark Tritton, Target’s chief merchandising officer.Crystal Palace Apartments

missing-texas-teen-1512484206183-9562553-ver1-0.jpg
A missing 13-year-old girl from Katy, Texas was found safe in Mexico Sunday thanks to an investigation by the FBI in cooperation with Mexican authorities.
Ashlee Hattermann ran away from home on Friday. Her parents said she left a note, saying she was meeting a 29-year-old man she had met online.
'We found a note in her room,' Keith Hattermann told KHOU. 'She calls the guy "daddy" and herself "baby girl." (The note read) "Daddy owns my body and my soul," over and over and over again down this sheet of paper.'
The Harris County Sheriff's Office said Sunday evening that Ashlee had been found safe in Mexico, and thanked the FBI's San Antonio field office, the ICE, Homeland Security and Mexican authorities for locating her.
Officials believe she traveled to Laredo and crossed into Mexico on Friday nightPsychic reading advice

Trading prices for crude increase, but Texas oil and gas employment is still weak
When oil prices dropped oil and gas producers were quick to lay off employees, but now that prices are slowly on the rise, employment is not rising with prices in the industry. In fact, according to an article in NGI’s Shale Daily, unemployment continues to rise in the industry. The number of active rigs in Texas for May averaged 182, as compared to last year in the same month when an average of 375 rigs were actively drilling in the state. The economic struggles associated with low oil prices have led to some industry leaders calling for a restriction on foreign energy imports.
Oil producers encourage grassroots movement to restrict imports.
The Albuquerque Journal reports an attempt by major oil producers, especially in New Mexico and West Texas, to include all major U.S. crude suppliers to restrict overseas oil imports. Efforts will formally begin in September at the Southeastern New Mexico Energy Summit in Carlsbad followed by other public meetings in the Bakken and Eagle Ford shale plays.
The purpose of the movement is to save oil field workers jobs and drive up domestic oil prices as a reaction to OPEC’s (Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries) massive production, which has driven down global prices. Currently 50 percent of US oil is supplied by the Mid-East, and that number is continuing to grow as domestic production slows.
Delaware Basin draws in deals from Permian
The Permian Basin has been a hotbed of activity in comparison to other shale plays across the U.S. But things might be changing. According to The Street, Canaccod Genuity Inc. analysts expect the Delaware basin to draw out deals for oil companies looking to buy oil assets. Some privately held companies may be willing to offer initial public offerings (IPO) for their stocks in the future as another strategy for funding.This is a password protected album.

</a>
To save and increase the capital, they must be invested as profitably as possible. It can be currency, gold, deposit.
But the most profitable can be called the purchase of shares of a prosperous enterprise.
Reliable shares - a stable profit
Among the banks of Russia and CIS countries, the first place inAll positions are taken by Sberbank of Russia. It owns 25% of the assets of the entire Russian Federation. This bank is reliable, because, unlike the banks-early maturity, its history counts more than a hundred years (another key to success). The position of Sberbank of Russia in the financial system is stable, therefore shareholders each year have the right to expect a corresponding profit.
The amount of dividends is established by the general meeting of shareholders of the Savings Bank of Russia.
Where to buy shares
If you are not a broker, the availability of the required amountNot enough. It is impossible to make a purchase "from hand to hand", for an individual this process is not available. Russian law reserves this right exclusively for brokerage companies and investment centers. Therefore, in Russia, the acquisition of shares is possible only through cooperation with two stock exchanges - RTS and MICEX (the Moscow International Currency Exchange) or the investment company Zerich Capital Management.
Having concluded the contract with professionals, having left onMarket of securities, it is necessary to investigate the system of proposals. To the attention of the consumer ordinary shares and privileged are granted. The difference between them is in nominal value and in the crushing ratio (1: 1000 and 1:20, respectively). Information on the issuance of shares, changing their quotes to date, can be found on the bank's website in the relevant section.
How to buy shares
The website also contains the conditions for providing Brokerage services, emphasizing the customers' attention to the features of the secondary market. So, the purchase of shares occurs in stages:
- replenishment of the broker's account,
- purchase of shares through Internet-trading (sale-purchase through the Internet).
Transactions are mainly made on the Moscow stock exchange. The value of securities depends on many factors, for example, economic, political.
Sberbank Russia provides the necessaryInformation, but does not guarantee that the purchase of its shares will be profitable. That is, to think, analyze and solve only the potential buyer. Positive indicators in the past do not guarantee a 100% profit in the future, although the bank's share package is among the most stable.Sexville free adult video chat commun!!

Our last edition covering late June can be found here.
That reliable source of comedy, the Confederation of British Industry, was making more headlines (online - the controlled media aren't very interested in mocking them). It was revealed that before they attempted to register as an official partner of the no campaign (alongside such groups as the far right Britannica) they had shared private conversations with the Electoral Commission.
This was at odds with statements made by CBI Director General John Cridland, who claimed he had no knowledge that his organisation would be making an application.
"In his submission to the Electoral Commission, Cridland insisted the CBI had received no legal advice prior to the application form being signed. However days earlier in a BBC interview the CBI Director General claimed his organisation had indeed received advice." Newsnet Scotland, 27th of June
In an unusual outbreak of frankness, Liberal Democrat and no campaigner Willie Rennie MSP, confirmed that Westminster can close the Scottish Parliament down at any time unless we vote for independence. He confirmed that it is a temporary institution and went on to say:
"They [the Westminster Parliament] can legislate on anything to do with the Scottish Parliament at any time." Willie Rennie MSP, June 2014
Of course, if a second question had been added to the ballot paper offering more powers and guaranteeing the Scottish Parliament's existence, then this wouldn't be an issue. But that option was opposed by...Willie Rennie. Great to see how much he values our parliament. June
Professor.
Can't count, won't count
It was great fun attending the BBC Bias protest on Sunday, the 29th of June. There were so many people and so much excitement. Over 2,000 people were present to show their discontent at the anti-independence bias which the BBC in Scotland produces.
The BBC, which stated that everything they have produced has been "fair and accurate" (we presume that they are including each of the 35+ stories here in their 'fair and accurate' assessment), claimed there were only 350 protesters. Check out sources from these blogs, domestic news and international news sites and below and judge which report is more accurate.
The reason we were protesting the BBC is the same reason they claimed that only 350 people were present...those at the top of the organisation are biased.
Can't count, will estimate
The BBC bias protest was not the only event taking place on the last weekend in June. Armed Forces Day was held in Sterling on Saturday, the 28th. The BBC used the MOD's (ridiculous) attendance figure of 35,000 when reporting the event, however you can see here (and here) that this is very detached from reality.
We know that the BBC is biased and would be keen to underplay the attendance of the protests against itself, but why give a false and inflated impression of Armed Forces Day?
." Wee Ginger Dug, A tale of two events
It's clear that many working for a no vote view militarism as a method for gaining support, but the reasoning goes beyond this. The UK Parliament is looking increasingly likely to pass a National Service Bill, which will make military service (or community service, something which Westminster views as a punishment) very likely for those who will be voting for the first time. It is this link between the state broadcaster and the state interests which causes so much concern.
"[T." Wee Ginger Dug, A tale of two events
Survey Group YouGov has come under criticism from online analysts for how it records support for independence amongst SNP voters.
The group, which now gives the lowest figures of support for a Yes vote and had stated as early as 2011 that a Yes vote was 'literally impossible', have so far refused to explain it's unusual methodology of splitting SNP supporters into two groups when weighting support. They have also failed to justify their position of not offering the base numbers in their datasets.
Laurence Janta-Lipinski, an employee of YouGov, stated on Twitter during an exchange with Scot Goes Pop:
"no, you will not get breakdown (of the hidden SNP datasets). Why? Why should you? We don't put up 1000s of potential xtabs at behest of bloggers" Laurence Janta-Lipinski
Survation and Scot Goes Pop, whose successful crowdfunding appeal raised £3,475 earlier this year, highlighted the flaw in the YouGov defence:
"(YouGov) specifically cites the eccentric practice of splitting SNP voters into two distinct groups as a reason for thinking YouGov are right and others are wrong. I'm not quite sure where that leaves Mr Janta-Lipinski's claim that it's OK to be ultra-secretive about that part of the methodology because it's just one trivial detail out of 'thousands'!" Scot Goes Pop, 2nd of July 2014
We have written before regarding how opinion polls can influence elections (see: 'It's Great to be Different') but experts appearing on the controlled media are not highlighting when polling agencies artificially lower Yes support in their figures. Thankfully, the controlled media is a dinosaur, and it is soon to be extinct!
Labour MPs helping David Cameron?
On Wednesday the 2nd of July, Jim Sheridan MP had a chance to challenge David Cameron during Prime Minister's Questions. What question would be the best to ask on behalf of his constituents in Paisley and Renfewshire North? Would he ask about widespread increases in poverty during a supposed recovery?
"Does the Prime Minister agree with me that there is a moral responsibility on employers to inform their employees what the consequencies of any separation of Scotland from the UK in order they can make an 'informed' choice prior to the referendum?" Jim Sheridan MP, 2nd of July 2014
Former Trade Union Convener Jim Sheridan thought the best way to represent his constituents was to ask a planted question to a Tory Prime Minister asking managers to tell their employees how to vote. Just read that line a few times again so that it sinks in. A Labour MP, a former Trade Union Convener, is helping David Cameron by asking a soft question encouraging bosses to be able to influence how their workers vote.
Of course, this tactic of having large corporations coercing their employees to vote a certain way isn't new. Jim Sheridan is calling on the UK Government to take the same approach that failed US Presidential candidate Mitt Romney encouraged in 2012.
But is there any economic justification for this approach? Earlier, Mr Sheridan claimed that companies were withholding investment in Scotland due to the referendum. This is at odds with reality as Scotland has seen a dramatic increase in investment since the referendum was announced. Good to see that he is aiding a Conservative Prime Minister for ideological rather than practical reasons!
Don't offer an opinion!
It was revealed that international news broadcaster Russia Today was warned against discussing the Scottish Independence referendum on their most popular show 'The Keiser Report'.
The show's host, Max Keiser, tweeted that he was not allowed to offer any opinion on-air at the risk of the channel losing their licence on Freeview. A petition to uncover who at OFCOM issued this warning to an outspoken supporter of a Yes vote and to allow Russia Today to report freely again has been started here.
A super big rally (with 220 people)
Prime Minister David Cameron was the star attraction at the super-mega important Rally for the Union. Just 220 people attended. Cough. That isn't even enough to fill a large passenger bus or even the economy seats on a 747 (not that David Cameron or his pals would ever need to travel economy!)
I'll give you £15 million a year for just £270 million (Deal or no Deal)
That is the offer Prime Minister David Cameron offered Scots in early July. This is a terrible deal which no amount of spin from the Daily Express can hide for long. Rather than reporting the reality that Glasgow will receive a paltry 6% of the cuts in welfare payments back, they instead claim that money being invested by the Scottish Government is also Cameron's (although if his family had paid tax in the UK it would probably equal this amount!).
Nurse, Nurse!
Earlier this year Sir Paul Nurse, a senior UK scientist, claimed that cancer research could be harmed by a Yes vote. Despite having obvious flaws, this statement was given blanket coverage throughout the controlled media.
In early July, Professor Anne Glover, Chief Scientific Adviser to outgoing EU president Jose Manuel Barroso, refuted the assertion that a Yes vote would negatively affect research in Scotland.
"On the 19th of September I don't see that changing because if I am in China or in North America, I want to work with the best and if the best are in Scotland, I'm still going to work with the best." Professor Anne Glover, Holyrood Magazine
Professor Glover has no titles to gain speaking positively or negatively regarding the referendum. So how does the BBC report this important (and independent) assessment? "Scottish Independence: Academics say 'Yes' vote could harm scientific research". You know BBC, writing headlines like this which are the opposite of reality is why so many people turned up to the 'anti-BBC bias' rally last month!
Then again, perhaps all of this could have been prevent if people stopped mixing science with politics! Nurse!!
Nurse, Nurse (2)!
We view the online version of the Huffington Post quite a lot. However this post from the 4th of July was read purely for its comedic value.
Dr Nicholas M Almond, who states that he is 'a quarter Scottish', made so many mistakes that it could be the most ill-informed piece of writing regarding the referendum. Thankfully, Reverend Stuart Campbell at Wings over Scotland made a full review of them.
"So that’s 16 flat-out major factual blunders, and a whole bunch of screaming batshit madness on top, squeezed into just 914 words. That’s one serious mistake every 57 words. (This paragraph has 65.) God alone knows how many it would have been if he hadn’t been a quarter Scottish. The bar’s certainly been set high for Johann Lamont’s next speech, that’s all we can say." Rev Stuart Campbell, Wings over Scotland
Oil, oil everywhere (except in the Scottish newspapers!)
On Sunday, the 6th of July, Professor Donald Mackay, board member of right wing think tank Reform Scotland, declared that the UK government's projections for an independent Scotland's oil revenues was woefully undervalued and half of what it should be (resulting in an extra £8,000,000,000 of revenue every year).
On Monday, the 7th of July, the following media outlets said nothing:
Scottish Sun
The Scotsman
The Herald
Scottish Daily Express
Scottish Daily Mail
Guardian
Courier
Press & Journal
BBC Website
STV website
Only the Sunday Mail ran with the story. What was even more ironic, was the response of the OBR (Office of Budget Responsibility). Upon their predictions being described as absurdly pessimistic, they further reduced their expectations for oil revenues. This aspect of the story was covered by the Times, Telegraph, Scotsman, Herald, Independent, Scottish Sun, Daily Record, Courier, Guardian, Press & Journal, Daily Mail, Financial Times, BBC and STV.
Many thanks to Wings over Scotland for spotting and covering the story.
Europa Un-Universalis
Professor Sionaidh Douglas-Scott of Oxford University produced a study in an independent Scotland's membership of the EU following a Yes vote. You can read it here. It highlighted that it was in the interests of other EU states to support Scotland's continued membership. Derek Bateman stated:
"[The report] lends an unimpeachable voice to the only sane solution on the EU, the one with least hurdles for existing members and the course already laid out by the Scottish Government. Her calm exposition reads like straightforward common sense when compared to the childishly hysterical screams of alarm from Unionist MEPs and commentators who don’t know any better." Derek Bateman, 8th of July 2014
That's pretty clear. And we received statements from Italy (who will hold the presidency of the EU till the end of the year) and the new president of the European Commission stating that the wishes of the people of Scotland will be respected. How many of the newspapers will highlight this?..
I wanna hold your hand
Our favourite story from early July involved Tory MP Rory Stewart. His 'hands across the border' (not actually taking place at the border) was designed to show how much people in the UK oppose decisions affecting Scotland being made in Scotland. However for 'logistical' reasons, this has been called off.
"I wonder if those "logistical" problems might conceivably include - a) not enough people, and b) the wrong border?" SCOT goes POP!, 9th of July 2014
I think that Scot goes Pop is wrong in this instance. The only problem must be that those about to take part just didn't know how to hold hands so, for the benefit of the no campaign and their leaders in Westminster, we have linked to this 'How to Hold Hands: 10 Steps' by wikiHow. Now that the real logistical problem has been solved, 'hands across the border' can take place...or maybe not.
What side would you like to be on?
This is a question those in the main stream media should be asking themselves (but so far aren't):
The BBC - A guide to how to mess up referendum coverage
The UK state broadcaster has made a number of unusual editorial decisions (unusual until you understand that it is merely an extension of Westminster that will do anything to maintain a status quo) but its latest spending choice is probably its biggest blunder of the campaign so far.
The BBC wants to host a debate in Glasgow regarding the referendum one week before the vote. This is fine, however they then proceeded to pay £100,000 so that a live audience of 12,000 people where maybe 0.0015% of them would be able to even ask a question (just 17 questions were asked in the 3rd US Presidential Debate which was 90 minutes long). If that was a stupid idea, then allowing the budget to spiral out of control to £500,000 is even worse.
What were they thinking?!
You've got mail (but don't worry, we deleted it)
"Communications between the Electoral Commission and the CBI that led to a meeting to discuss the independence referendum, have been deleted the electoral watchdog has told Newsnet Scotland." Newsnet Scotland, 12th of July 2014
Is this how the impartial, accountable and professional Electoral Commission is supposed to behave? Is it right that they don't appear bothered by errors in the official no campaign registration or have much interest in the spending and actions of the no campaigning Orange Order? We will leave these questions up to you readers.
I would cycle 500 miles
A number of the Sign for Scotland team managed to meet Indy Cyclist Mark Coburn on his 500 miles fundraiser. The campaign, which was generating funds for 10 local yes groups as well as Maryhill food bank, started on Thursday, the 10th of July and easily surpassed the initial goal of £5,000. The fundraiser officially ends on Friday the 18th so if you haven't donated yet then please consider doing so.
Checking your purse before your pulse
This is one of the most important reasons for supporting a Yes vote:
"But there is a further threat facing the NHS. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) is the fruit of long-running negotiations between the EU and the US over trade liberalisation. One of its fundamental principles is that services, including state services, should be open to private competition from American multinationals. According to Garcia Bercero, the EU Commission official with responsibility for TTIP, health services in Europe will be opened to private competition, but only where privatisation is already established.
In other words, where there is an existing state monopoly, foreign companies cannot sue the government in question for unfair competition.
But. We are a long way from that being tested in law, but what is beyond doubt is that the UK has made the NHS in England TTIP compliant. It seems highly likely that the Scottish system will be seen as an unacceptable anachronism in a unitary state." Sunday Herald, 13th of July 2014
Independent nations are capable of defending and representing themselves. Even if you believe that health care should be privatised, it is wrong for that view to be forced upon the people against their wishes. If you believe it, then you should have the courage of your convictions, start campaigning and win debates, not wait for an uncontrollable Westminster to force it through (especially since many of the House of Lords stand to gain financially if health care profiteering takes place).

When looking at a government's debt burden over time, the most useful quick metric is the ratio of total accumulated debt/GDP. Here's a CBO figure from March 2017 showing this metric for the US economy over time--and projections for the next couple of decades. The common pattern over time is that the debt/GDP ratio rises sharply during wartime, and around times of extreme economic stress like the Great Depression of the 1930s and the more recent Great Recession.
But the Great Recession ended back in June 2009, and the US unemployment rate has been 5% or lower for more than two years, since September 2015. Moreover, the long-term projections from CBO suggest that existing government programs are going to exert very large pressures for higher government debt in the next couple of decades, as the boomer generation retires and health care costs continue to rise. When (and not if) the next recession arrives, it will be a good time to run larger deficits again. But the case for a tax cut to stimulate the US economy that reported a 4.1% unemployment rate in October 2017 is weak.
What about the effects of the tax bill on economic incentives? I sometimes use the analogy that economies carrying a tax burden are similar to a hiker carrying gear for a back-country excursion. If the hiker has a well-fitted and well-padded backpack, with the weight nicely distributed, it's a lot easier to hike all day. If you took the exact same camping gear and randomly attached it to hiker around their body--some on the feet, the heaviest weight on the right arm and nothing on the left arm--that same amount of weight becomes very difficult to carry. Thus, the question of tax reform is not whether the burden should be higher or lower, but rather how best to distribute a given amount of weight.
There are of course lots of estimates of how the tax bill will affect incentives, but the estimates of the Joint Committee on Taxation are especially worthy of notice. Because Republicans control Congress, that party also controls the Joint Committee on Taxation. However, many staff members of the JCT soldier on from one administration to the next, showing both some willingness to be flexible as their political guidance changes, but also showing some stubbornness in insisting on a certain level of consistency and logic in their estimates. Thus, economists who tend to align with the Democratic party like Larry Summers, Jason Furman, and Paul Krugman have all been willing to cite the JCT estimates as a reasonable basis for discussion (although I'm sure they also disagree with these estimates in various ways).
Here are some comments from the JCT report. "Macroeconomic Analysis of the“Tax Cut and Jobs Act” as Ordered Reported by the Senate Committee on Finance on November 16, 2017" (November 30, 2017):
We estimate that this proposal would increase the level of output (as measured by Gross Domestic Product) by about 0.8 percent on average over the 10- year budget window. That increase in income would increase revenues, relative to the conventional estimate of a loss of $1,414 billion ... by $458 billion over that period. This budget effect would be partially offset by an increase in interest payments on the Federal debt of about $50 billion over the budget period. We expect that both an increase in GDP and resulting additional revenues would continue in the second decade after enactment, although at a lower level, as many of the provisions that are expected to increase GDP within the budget window expire before the second decade.Thus, this estimate incorporates a moderate version of the Republican believe that the tax cut will boost growth, but even after adding such an effect, taxes are estimated to be about $1 trillion lower over 10 years. What about more specific changes to the individual income tax? The JCT report summarizes the main changes in this way:
"The bill changes individual income tax rates, lowering the top individual income tax rate from 39.6 percent to 38.5 percent, creating an additional individual income tax rate bracket, and lowering statutory tax rates for most tax rate brackets, while changing the measure used to adjust the brackets for inflation from the present law consumer price index (“CPI-U”) to the chained consumer price index (“chained CPI”). The chained CPI grows more slowly than the CPI-U, thus resulting in people over time moving into higher rate brackets at a faster rate under the bill than under present law. The bill also reduces individual shared responsibility payments for failure to obtain qualified health insurance coverage enacted as part of the affordable care act to zero. At the same time, the proposal eliminates a number of deductions and credits from their individual taxable income while increasing others. The biggest changes include eliminating personal exemptions while increasing the standard deduction, and increasing the maximum amount of the child tax credit while increasing the income range over which individuals may claim it."Thus, while the bill does reduce taxes at high income levels, that doesn't seem to me the main thrust of the bill. The cost of the dramatic rise in the standard deduction and to a lesser extent in the child tax credit is very high. To me, one of the most interesting dimensions of this change is that with a much higher standard deduction, many fewer taxpayers would find it worthwhile to itemize deductions. Thus, if or when proposals resurface a few years from now to reduce popular deductions like the one for home mortgage interest or state and local taxes, many fewer people will be using those deductions, and the political calculus around them may shift.
The bill also shifts business taxation, with a goal of reducing corporate tax rates and encouraging firms to repatriate earnings now held abroad. It's hard to remember amidst the political din, but these were also announced goals of the Obama administration. For example, a joint report from the Obama White House and the Department of the Treasury in April 2016 called "The President’s Framework for BusinessTax Reform: An Update," included comments like:
"The Framework would eliminate dozens of different tax expenditures and fundamentally reform the business tax base to reduce distortions that hurt productivity and growth. It would reinvest these savings to lower the corporate tax rate to 28 percent, putting the United States in line with major competitor countries and encouraging greater investment in America. ... Our tax system should not give companies an incentive to locate production overseas or engage in accounting games to shift profits abroad, eroding the U.S. tax base."For comparison, here's the JCT description of the corporate tax changes in the Senate version of the tax reform plan:
"In addition, the bill lowers the corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent beginning in 2019; and, it increases the rate of bonus depreciation to 100 percent while extending it for five years, from 2018 through 2022. The bill also repeals or limits deductions for a number of business expenses, the largest of which is a 30 percent limit on interest deductibility. Finally, the bill makes significant changes to the taxation of both foreign and domestically controlled multinational entities. It would allow domestic corporations to receive a dividend from their foreign subsidiaries without incurring United States tax on the income. It also creates a new minimum tax for certain related party transactions in order to reduce the erosion of the United States corporate income tax base. In a further effort to reduce base erosion, it equalizes the tax treatment of specified high return income from foreign sales whether they are earned through a foreign corporation or a domestic corporation."There are clear differences between the plans, of course. The Obama administration was talking about cutting the corporate tax rate to 28%, not 20%. In addition, the Obama plan emphasized that changes to corporate taxes should be revenue-neutral. But on other other side, the Obama proposal is a white paper, not actual legislation, which means that it had not been put through the Congressional meat-grinder where seemingly every legislator is demanding a sweet tidbit of their own devising in exchange for supporting the bill.
Assuming this tax bill moves forward and becomes law in essentially its current form, one of the most interesting aspects to keep track of will be its effect on investment. There is a widespread fear that ongoing low levels of investment are slowing US economic growth, both in the short-run and the long-term. A common solution proposed by Democratic-leaning economists has been to support a high level of infrastructure spending, and before President Trump was elected, it was common to hear arguments pointing out that if an infrastructure investment could be financed at today's low interest rates, and if that infrastructure investment brought a long-term payoff, it would be economically sensible to undertake the project even if it increased short-run budget deficits. In effect, the current Republican tax bill repurposes that argument into a claim that if certain tax changes call forth sufficient private sector investment, then it is worth increased budget deficits as well.
This already overlong blog post isn't the place to try to sort through the merits of public-sector and private-sector investment, and whether the kind of politically-driven infrastructure spending on roads and bridges that typically bubbles up through Congress is the most productive way to build a strong base for the US economy in the 21st century. I think it might be even more useful to consider an infrastructure agenda applying to energy resources and to data networks, and for hardening this infrastructure against physical- and cyber-attack. But focusing just on the Republican tax plan, the additional budget deficits seem certain to be very high and the promised investment benefits seem relatively small and uncertain.Working on your business is not the same as working in your business. That came as news to me when I first read Lynn Grodski’s primer, Building Your Ideal Private Practice. I used to think that if I was seeing my clients or charting notes on my clients that I was working on my business. After all, this is why I went to graduate school — to learn the clinical piece.
It’s Not Enough
Unfortunately, the clinical knowledge and skills of psychotherapy did not begin to prepare me for the business end of private practice. As long as I wanted to work in an agency or hospital for someone else, that would have been good enough. However, for those of us who have the entrepreneurial bug and yearn to be in business for ourselves . . . the clinical knowledge and skills are only half of the private practice package. In fact, you can easily and quickly starve to death if you know nothing or do nothing to work on the business end of your practice.
Working On Your Business
To paraphrase Lynn Grodski, “working on your business is at least as important as working in your business.” And, working on the business means spending time, money, and resources to create and sustain a healthy flow of clients coming into your business. Some of these tasks include:
- Developing ideas for new services;
- Learning about new marketing strategies;
- Re-working packaging for your services;
- Branding for your business;
- Designing business cards, letterhead, postcards, and advertising;
- Networking with other professionals to educate them about your business;
- Creating (and using) a marketing kit;
- Writing articles / books for publication;
- Drafting informational brochures for client education; and,
- Updating your professional vita;
To work on your business means recognizing that your work in private practice extends far beyond just the skills of counseling and psychotherapy.
What I’m Doing
Today, I have met with my graphic designer, Jennifer Gunther of Nudge Creative, to rework my business card and letterhead. I have vetted a potential printer for my print needs. I have collaborated with my blog designer, Beth Hayden of Basics of Blogging. I met another colleague for lunch to brainstorm about my marketing needs. I’m writing this post for my blog. These are the things that I am doing to work on my business today.
What about you? What are the ways that you are working on your business today?

World Travel Market 2013 will generate more than £2 billion (€2.35 billion) worth of business and £160 million for the London economy, the event’s organisers predict.
The four-day event, which opens on Monday, will attract more than 50,000 of the global travel industry’s most senior executives.
Some 225 new exhibitors will attend the event this year. The biggest increase is in WTM’s new Travel Tech Show, where 61 new technology exhibitors have booked space. The second biggest growth in numbers has been seen in Europe, where 43 companies and tourist boards will be making their debuts.
“WTM plays a vital role for both the global travel and tourism industry, facilitating more than £2 billion in industry deals,” Simon Press, Reed Travel Exhibitions’ senior exhibition director, said.
“The event has a massive impact on the London economy with 50,000 senior executives staying in the capital and spending money on hotels and evening entertainment, totalling more than £160 million.”

2) As root, edit the ppd file for the printer: it is located in /etc/cups/ppd/ and titled "printer.ppd" with "printer" being the cups name for the printer.

On the South Coast there was a heavy, but not spectacular surf. Just inside the harbour, I found a group of black shags (Phalacrocorax carbo). They seemed to be just hanging about, not fishing or doing anything purposeful. I speculate that they were simply sheltering from the chilly Southerly.
Around the headland a few individual shags were making hard work of getting where they were going. Shags have very small wings for their body weight, and they depend a lot on flying close to the surface of the water to get the “ground effect”. When the surface is heaving up and down, flying requires more effort, and there is a lot of flapping for comparatively little forward motion.
Waves have always fascinated me, especially the long slow ones with real power behind them. You may get a sense of the day with the last image and the shape of that incoming wave. I would not wish to be among those rocks with such waves.
Something different tomorrow, I hope.

The postgame press conference can often be a very monotonous affair. Coaches get the same questions in different variations throughout the year and give the same answers in response to those questions. But, sometimes, these press conferences can provide us with great moments, particularly when they involve kids.
That was the case tonight for South Carolina head coach Frank Martin when he was asked a question by a Sports Illustrated for Kids reporter following his team’s win against Baylor. Martin took time to praise the young, intrepid reporter for his thoughtful question before proceeding with his answer. Make sure to have the volume up on your computer when you watch the video.
Those are the kinds of moments you love to see, and I have to say, impressive job done by the kid. Seems to have a future in this business.THE FARMER FAMILY
.JPG)
.JPG)
Welcome to our blog "The Thread to Mylee"! Let me start by telling you a little bit about how we ventured into this journey called adoption. My name is Gina Farmer and my husband is Donnie. We have 3 biological children; Whitney (22), Dillon (14) and Peyton (11), and an adopted daughter from China, Maci (2).
We actually got the idea to adopt from China by attending a Steven Curtis Chapman concert. During the concert, God was really working on Donnies heart. During intermission he told me he was going to get some information on adopting from China. I was totally taken by surprise, but overwhelmed with joy!
But how could we afford this? We knew that if God had spoke to our hearts to adopt, He would take care of the financial end of it. Philippians 4:19 says "And my God will meet all your needs according to his glorious riches in Christ Jesus." We adopted our beautiful daughter, Maci Marie JiaoLe Farmer on Christmas Day 2006! She has been such a blessing to our family and has brought us nothing but pure joy! We thank God for little Maci each and every day!
But God wasn't finished there! He spoke to me and Donnie yet again. So with great faith and little hesitation, we have started the paperwork to adopt another little girl from China. We will name her Mylee.
Debbie Wankel, a very special friend, called me one day and asked if I had thought about starting a blog to raise money for our adoption. She offered to help make hair bows and hand-made cards to sell. She even used her own money to get it started. Debbie and her husband are in the process of adopting a little girl from Ethiopia.
Our prayer is to raise above and beyond what we need to adopt little Mylee. We will then use the money we have raised to start a fund to help other families adopt internationally. Many families can afford the day to day expenses of raising a child, but cannot afford the inital cost of adoption. We want to help those families experience the same love and joy we have had by welcoming a beautiful child into their family. God bless!PORT AU PRINCE, Haiti (CMC) — Haiti on Monday announced six days of official mourning for the late former president Rene Preval, who died last weekend at his home of a cerebral vascular accident (CVA) or stroke.
A CVA is the sudden death of some brain cells due to lack of oxygen when the blood flow to the brain is impaired by blockage or rupture of an artery to the brain. Symptoms of a stroke depend on the area of the brain affected.
Secretary General of the Presidency, Yves Germain Joseph, said that Preval’s funeral will take place on Saturday, March 11 and his body will lie in state at the Museum of the Haitian National Pantheon (MUPANAH) on Friday.

I loved reading this series looking at what might have happened if Darcy had a mentor who encouraged him to better act upon the good principles he knew were right, and what might have happened if Lizzy and her sisters worked to counteract Lydia's stupid behavior. This second book in the series focuses on the Bennet family right before Collins comes to visit and before Bingley comes to Netherfield. It 's a journey of discovery for Elizabeth, and it's nice to see the four oldest sisters work together to encourage their different gifts as they face challenges thrown their way. The ending of the story is delightful, as Lizzy is able to be her shining self, after some trying times.
I really enjoyed the narration of this story, which definitely brought the story to life even more.Up and down the hills
Up and down the hills in the desertRight outside our door is a small dirt road. To call it a road is a stretch I think, more like a 4 wheeler path. It goes up and down hills, around and through washes, and keeps going farther then we have been on it. Mom has been taking Torrey on this road and they are running and hiking up and down the hills. Torrey is wiped out when they get back, so it must be fun.

Beautiful Photos!~5/17/2011 ~ Do you remember the wondrous woman in Chapter Three of my book, whose grandmother saved her from teenage depression by “prescribing” Maya Angelou’s “Phenomenal Woman” as medicine, to be recited morning and night? C.C. Carter is now a world renowned performance poet who is using her voice to stop violence against women. She founded POW WOW, INC, a weekly spoken venue that has changed the lives of men and women “who refuse to stay silent” about abuse.
I received this extraordinary poem from her last month and want to share it, and her work, with you (scroll down for more information on C.C. and POW WOW):
I was saved by a poem, by a poem written on a page but
recited out loud. A poem that begged to be spoken cause its
intention would be missed if hummed under breath silently.
I was saved by a poem, by a poem that infused the
Mississippi Mass Choir and Nikki Giovanni’s voice over
a stereo system on Sunday morning before leaving for church.
I was saved by a poem, by a poem that transformed my
grandmother from a little old lady into a sultry Harlem
Renaissance starlet reciting Langston Hughes and Paul
Laurence Dunbar while peeling white potatoes and
snapping green beans or playing dress up with clothes
from her secret trunk hidden in the attic – I, by her side
watching and mimicking every move and vocal intonation.
I was saved by a poem, a poem that was my prayer taped to
my mirror so that I could recite every night before bed and
every morning before leaving for school – my armor into the world
of petite thin girls and weight watcher recruiters who
dared to try and battle me and Maya as Phenomenal Women.
I was saved by a poem, by a choreopoem just for colored girls
like me who were raised with a myriad of etiquette and
cultural codes of conduct of shouldn’ts, couldn’ts,
wouldn’ts and don’ts. I was saved by a poem, by a poem
that I once wrote that I didn’t always believe its power,
but performed anyway – pretended grandma was right next
to me, watched women come alive from being dead inside,
start dancing and swaying big hips and ample thighs and
then I joined in, felt their testimony and was saved too,
again. I was saved by a poem.

Those are fried banana nuggets on top, then a crispy banana cracker (how else would you describe it?), over a super-tender braised beef with tomatoes and peas and so on.
They also served a little bread basket with rounds that had been pressed and grilled, like a dense version of the bread part of a grilled cheese sandwich. I’m not doing it justice; I would go back for the bread basket alone.
Delicious.
Is it time for lunch yet?

Oh, that’s the dish they put nanoneurons in to turn you into a Castro loyalist. Dang tasty, though.
It’s worth it.
As a side note, “Ropa Vieja” means “Old Clothes”. Not the most delectable name.
Okay Donnie Downer. :)

“Step it out” is incredible!
I liked step it out best, but it could have used some better lyrics.
I loved the concept of Move to the drums but it fell short because it could have used a harder drum line and i liked the lyrics although there weren’t many other than being drunk.

Shuffleboard powder is a finely granulated substance that people sprinkle or spray over shuffleboard courts and sometimes tables in order to lower the friction of players’ pucks. The powder acts as a lubricant that helps the pucks glide faster and more efficiently, and can make the game more fun. It’s usually made out of tiny bead-like particles of slippery plastic or other synthetic materials, often combined with something like cornstarch. Manufacturers sometimes create products with different proportions of specific ingredients in order to achieve certain desired outcomes, and powders are frequently sold by the speeds they’re promised to achieve. Powders tend to be really helpful in some respects but they can also be troublesome to clean, and they’re most common on larger courts for this reason. Sprinkling powder over a table can get messy, and wax is often chosen instead in these circumstances.
Shuffleboard is a game played with pucks that opponents glide or “shuffle” across a scored game board in order to win points. The most traditional form of this game takes place on large courts, and players push the pucks with spade-shaped sticks called tangs. Table versions are also popular; in these instances, players stand on opposite ends of a long, narrow shuffleboard table and push the pucks with their hands to get them into goals on the other side.
The game works best when the surface is slick and doesn’t cause a lot of friction with the puck. This is where shuffleboard powder comes in. It helps the pucks glide, which allows them to go farther and gives players more control. Of course, powder doesn’t replace the need for regular maintenance like cleaning and oiling the surface. It can help improve the game, though, and can contribute to a more enjoyable playing experience.
In most cases the powder is a composite of silicone and cornstarch. The silicone is typically formed into very small beads or rounds, and the starch basically keeps those beads more or less together and prevents them from bouncing and spilling all over the court or table. Some products are made with other synthetic plastics, but the sphere shape is more or less ubiquitous. The idea is usually to elevate the puck just slightly, almost giving it the feeling of floating as it glides.
There are usually a number of different products available, and much of the choice depends on users’ specific needs. There are typically different formulations for tables versus floors, for instance, and there are often a number of different speed rankings, too. In general, the more silicone a product contains, the faster the puck will glide.
This loose powder often resembles talcum, cornstarch, or confectioner's sugar, and it’s usually sold in a cylindrical container that reminds some people of a can of powdered bleach cleanser. The array of holes on the top of the can allows users to shake the contents for more even distribution. Powders that are intended more for use on courts or large floorboards might also come in spray varieties. The product is usually the same, but wide-nozzle sprayers can make application more efficient.
Shuffleboard powder is just one option for people looking to improve glide while reducing friction. Many board owners use waxes or varnishes for this purpose; determining which product is best is usually a matter of circumstance and use. There are pros and cons to almost any option. One of the biggest downsides to powder is that the distribution can be uneven, which can lead to choppiness of puck movement. Users sometimes also complain that the residue is difficult to remove once the game is over. With floor versions, the board usually just needs to be swept; tables, though, can prove more challenging in this regard.

Have you ever wanted to go behind the scenes of a masterpiece? Many of us have been lucky enough to have visited our favourite artworks hanging in galleries. But we rarely see the background behind them, just see the finished product. The Dublin City Gallery The Hugh Lane in Dublin however offers a chance to see the actual studio of one of our greatest painters, Francis Bacon.
The studio was donated to the gallery after Francis Bacon’s death and brought over from his property in London. It was then recreated exactly in Dublin. Everything from his studio, from the floor to the ceiling, even the dust was reassembled exactly as Francis left it for the last time! In total there are some 7,000 items in the small room which makes for a chaotic scene, but it gives you a great impression of the man as he was.
Francis Bacon’s Studio
Among the many treasures in the exhibit including art equipment, books, photographs and furniture, are one hundred slashed and destroyed canvases. These give you an impression of the techniques used by the artist to create his works and span some fifty years of his career. For me, it is one of the more poignant aspects of the room.
The recreation of this space allows the visitor to get an unrivaled and exciting glimpse behind the scenes of the artist responsible for the worlds most expensive painting ever sold at auction (when not factoring in inflation). The triptych, Three Studies of Lucian Freud (1969) sold recently in New York for an astounding sum of $142 million (eclipsing the price paid for “The Scream” last year) is a truly stunning piece of art and clearly encapsulates the unique style of this talented artist. The painting, in three separate pieces was actually split up for a while in the 1970s before being reunited in the 1990s.
The ‘Three Studies of Lucian Freud’, by Francis Bacon
The painting was purchased by an anonymous phone bidder so we have no idea where this masterpiece is heading. We can only hope that this fine treasure is not hidden forever but instead made public. I am a huge believer in important artwork being made available to the public as opposed to being locked away in private collections. It would be amazing if it were to be displayed in Bacon’s home town. However I must accept that whom ever purchased this painting has the right to do what they please with it. In the meantime you can always pop along to the fantastic Hugh Lane Gallery and visit the studio of the great artist to get a sense of th mind that created this chaos, and beauty.
Admission to the gallery is free too!

NEW YORK (JTA) -- With advocates for Ethiopian immigration to Israel stepping up their pressure on the Israeli government, Israeli Interior Ministry officials are returning to Ethiopia to check the eligibility for aliyah of approximately 3,000 more Falash Mura.
The three representatives from the Interior Ministry, who were scheduled to leave Thursday for Ethiopia, are tasked with verifying whether anyone remaining in the country has legitimate claims to immigrate to Israel.
Ethiopians able to prove their Jewish lineage remain eligible for Israeli citizenship under the Law of Return, and 400 are currently in the process of immigrating that way, according to the Jewish Agency for Israel.
Advocates are hoping this new effort -- coming a year after the last planeload of Falash Mura immigrants landed in Tel Aviv -- will reopen the gates to mass Ethiopian immigration and lead to the eventual consideration of at least 8,700 additional Ethiopians.
“Continuing discussions are being held at the highest level of the Israeli government which would also authorize inspecting the 8,700,” said Joseph Feit, a key advocate for Ethiopian aliyah and a past president of the North American Conference on Ethiopian Jewry, the main Jewish advocacy and aid organization working in Ethiopia.
Ethiopian immigration long has vexed the Israeli government. Several times, Israeli governments have committed to bringing a finite number of immigrants whom advocates said constituted all the remaining Ethiopians eligible for aliyah, only to be told once the number had been reached that thousands more had been left behind.
Israel completed the most recent phase of mass Ethiopian aliyah last August, when the last of some 16,095 immigrants arrived under a 2003 decision by Ariel Sharon’s government to bring those eligible from a 1999 Israeli census of possible Ethiopian olim.
That census counted some 27,000 Ethiopians as potentially eligible for aliyah, but upon examination only 16,095 of those who filed immigration petitions turned out to qualify and were brought to Israel. Others received rejection notices or never filed petitions.
The purpose of the new Interior Ministry effort is to give those from the 1999 census who never petitioned for aliyah a chance to do so. In order to be eligible for this special opportunity, the Falash Mura must have relatives in Israel file an aliyah application on their behalf by July 31.
The Interior Ministry is supposed to complete the verification process by Sept. 30. Israeli officials say they plan to check approximately 3,000 individuals.
Falash Mura advocates, however, want Israel to check the eligibility of 8,700 Ethiopians whom they say are waiting in the northern Ethiopian city of Gondar to move to Israel.
The Ethiopians migrated to Gondar from their rural farming villages over the last several years -- a move that left most without means of supporting their families. As a consequence, they have become dependent on aid offered at centers funded by NACOEJ and supported by individual local Jewish federations in North America and the United Jewish Communities, the North American arm of the federation system.
The centers, located in gated compounds, provide Jewish education, school lunches and some employment assistance to the population. No housing is provided.
The American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee used to operate health clinics in Gondar to provide for the medical needs of the Falash Mura, but the clinics closed in April after aliyah depleted their client base. The few Ethiopians who remained because their applications for aliyah were rejected were referred to Gondar’s hospital, where the JDC continues to pay for their medical care out of humanitarian considerations.
Advocates for the Falash Mura have been unable to convince the Israeli government to facilitate another mass aliyah movement. Ethiopians among the 3,000 who are deemed eligible for aliyah will be brought to Israel at the rate of 100 per month, according to the Jewish Agency, which is handling the aliyah operation.
“Initially there’s going to be 3,000 to check, and then the government will decide how to proceed,” said a spokesman for the Jewish Agency, which paid for the Interior Ministry delegation visiting Ethiopia. “They’re beginning with the 3,000, but everyone’s talking about a ballpark figure of 8,000 to 10,000.”
Many Israeli officials believe that the 8,700 Ethiopians for which the advocates are pushing,” Meir Sheetrit, Israel’s interior minister under Ehud Olmert, told the Jerusalem Post in a 2007 interview about the 8,700.
The new Israeli interior minister, Eli Yishai of the Shas Party, appears more favorably disposed to Ethiopian aliyah. In a previous stint as interior minister in 2003, Yishai supported additional mass Falash Mura immigration.
The Falash Mura are distinct from the Ethiopian Jews who retained their Jewish identity and observances over hundreds of years, and immigrated to Israel during Operation Moses in the 1980s and Operation Solomon in 1991.
On May 12, the Israeli government issued a decision saying that once the current group of 3,000 is checked, organized immigration to Israel from Ethiopia will cease.
Similar commitments in the past have collapsed under pressure from Ethiopian advocates in Israel and the United States, including Jewish federations in North America.
Whether the Israeli government’s decision of May 12 will be any different remains to be seen.BMW 7 series 740i 1998 November 19, 2016 admin BMW 0 City fuel economy 17.5 Highway fuel economy 8.2 Mixed mode fuel economy 11.9 Fuel tank volume 90 Fuel distance from 510 Fuel distance to 1100 Recommended fuel AI-98 Ecological standard Full speed 240 Time for acceleration to 100 km/h 7Frauenarbeit Women in engineering--United States Wissenschaftlerin Femmes en ingénierie Leadership 9780784409206 078440920X Reston, Va.

Both the public and businesses are worried about the idea of taxing health benefits. iStockphoto.com hide caption
Pros And Cons Of Taxing Health Benefits
Supporters say taxing benefits could:
— Slow premium cost growth by encouraging less-expensive health insurance.
— Provide financing needed for a health overhaul bill.
— End the advantage of those who get health insurance through their jobs tax free over those who buy insurance on their own, who don't.
Critics say changing the benefits. system, estimated to cost more than $1 trillion over 10 years. There's a lot of money at stake: Because health benefits are excluded from payroll and income taxes, the U.S. Treasury lost out on $226 billion in 2008, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation.
Politically,.
There's also "a lurking fear that the whole basis of employer-sponsored health insurance system may be at risk if we start fooling around with the tax exemption," Bos said.
How would all this affect you? Currently, workers who get health insurance from their employers don't pay income or payroll taxes on the cost of the policy. Self-employed people can deduct the cost of their premiums. But workers who don't get employer coverage and buy their own policies generally don't get the tax break.
Ideas for changing current policies fall into three broad categories: taxing health benefits above a certain dollar amount, taxing only wealthier people, or replacing the tax break with a tax credit.
Option 1: Cap The Tax Break
This would tax workers on the portion of their health benefits that exceeds a set amount. Determining that benchmark is tricky. The higher it is, the less revenue government would collect.
The benchmark could be the national average premium for comprehensive policies. Those policies currently cost on average $4,704 a year for single workers or $12,680 for family coverage, according to an annual survey of employers by the Kaiser Family Foundation. (Kaiser Health News is part of the foundation.)
Workers with policies priced higher than the benchmark would be taxed on the difference. Those with premiums below the benchmark would owe nothing. About 48 percent of workers with family health insurance currently have a policy with premiums at or above the national average, the Kaiser survey found..
The Impact
How much an additional $115. States are likely to tax the income, too.
A worker earning $180,000 would be in the 33 percent tax bracket and owe $495, plus $115 if Social Security and Medicare taxes are included.
For workers who are self-employed, the impact is not clear. Lawmakers may consider them employers and allow them to continue deducting health insurance costs as business expenses. Or the self-employed may, like workers,.
Option 2: Tax The Rich
This option would tax only those.
The Impact
The income threshold is key. A Senate Finance Committee policy options paper 1. The Lewin report, assuming a gradual phase.
Option 3: End The Tax Break
A group of conservative Republicans has introduced a bill that would tax health benefits, but provide a tax credit of $2,290 for individuals and $5,710 for families. Another bill, co-sponsored by Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) and Sen. Robert Bennett (R-UT), would also tax health combination of the two.
The Impact
Under the Republican bill, if you're a single worker paid $50,000 and covered by a $3,500 health insurance policy you would.

Loren was sitting at the coffee shop on her break when Mel, he best friend walked in.
"You know what today is?"
"Buy one donut get one free day?" Loren smiled.
"Oh come on, I know you're excited about you're 3 month anniversary with Cam!"
Loren smiled, "He's taking me out to dinner at 6, and then we're going to the fair.""Ugh so romantic. Make sure you pay the guy to stop the Ferris wheel when you guys are at the top."
Loren laughed, "I just can't believe it's been 3 months!"
"I know I thought you would have dumped him for Eddie when Eddie dumped Chloe."
"No, Eddie and I are just friends.""Hard to believe we tried to sneak into his concert"
"I know we were crazy fan girls weren't we?"
They laughed and talked until Adam came in and Loren had to go back to work. About an hour later Loren was making herself a coffee to go when Cam scared her.
"HEY!" he said creeping up behind her. She spilled her, thankfully iced, coffee down her shirt and pants, ruining them completely.
"Cam!"
"Sorry babe." He kissed her as she came out from behind the counter getting ready to end her shift.
"What's up?"
"Just wanted to be positive we're on after my practice."
"Wouldn't miss it for the world. I have to go change. But I'll see you after my session with Eddie"
"Alright see you then" Cam said as he walked Loren to her car.
She started the car and texted Eddie. 'Gonna be a little late. I have to change my clothes.'
She drove home to an empty house. Her mom left her a note on the wall.
'Out with Don. Be gone till late xoxox Mom'
Loren sneered. She hated her mom dating Don Masters. Not only because he is Adriana's dad but because she could tell there was something not right with him. He's a player, she can feel it. She crumpled the paper and threw it in the trash. Her phone vibrated, Eddie texted her back. 'Hurry here; songwriting isn't fun unless you're here '
She smiled and got ready to meet Eddie.
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
Eddie was sitting at his and Loren's spot. They tried writing songs in a studio, at the club and everywhere really but here is where their minds really click. They've written 3 songs now and Eddie was ecstatic. With Loren's help, his record label was getting what they wanted and he was having fun writing songs. He saw her walk up with foam cooler. That was their deal; he brings the guitar, she brings the food. He quickly checked his breath and stood up to take the cooler from her.
"Hey Loren," he said hugging her, "have fun at work?"
"Yeah because I love dealing with stuck up rich kids from school and smelling like coffee all the time." They laughed.
"You smell fine. Ready to get started?"
"Yeah, but I have to leave early today." She said sitting down.
"What why?"
"Well, tonight is my 3 month anniversary with Cam."
"Oh, okay." He didn't know why but this really bothered him. He didn't like Cam. Something about him just rubbed him the wrong way and he would be damned to see him hurt Loren.
For the next few hours they laughed and wrote lyrics to their new song. It seemed like 10 minutes went by when Melissa called Loren.
"Hey Mel you're on speaker"
"WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU?"
"I'm songwriting with Eddie why?"
"It's 5:00! You were supposed to be here half an hour ago!"
"Shit, I'll be there in 5 minutes."
She hung up the phone and picked up her stuff, "This was fun Eddie. See you tomorrow?"
"Yeah have fun on your date." He said with a half smile. He watched her walk away and wished she would stay. He looked out and saw the sun start to set.
'Why does this bother me so much?' he thought.
He picked up his car keys and drove to his dad's club. He needed to talk to someone.
"Hey Eddie" Max said ad Eddie walked in the door.
"Hey, pop" Eddie said, "I need to talk to you." With that Eddie said everything on his mind. When he was finished his dad was smiling at him with an eyebrow raised.
"Son, you're jealous" Max said.
"No dad, she's just a friend."
"Please, you always talk about her, want to spend time with her. You hate it when she's with any other guy. She's been there for you since you and Chloe broke up. It's normal that you developed feelings."
Eddies looked at his dad, "Shit" he said. His dad handed him a beer and his phone vibrated.
"Loren just tweeted a photo of her and Cameron at the top of the Ferris wheel." He said turning his phone off.
"Go home son, it's late." Max said putting a hand on Eddie's back. Eddie left the club and went home. He laid down in his bed and thought about what Max said. It was the complete truth.
'I can't try and take her from Cameron, she really likes him. But I'm better than that guy. He doesn't deserve her. No, she's happy I won't do this to her.' Eddie rolled onto his side and tried to fall asleep. 'Just keep your mouth shut, Duran' he told himself as he drifted into a dreamless sleep.

For families looking for a days activity this can be lots of fun - watching the plowing matches, seeing the equipment and displays(over 300).I spent most of today consolidating two of my storage sheds into one. It was a long, hot, grueling, tiring and dirty job - not fun at all but it had to be done. I can't keep paying money to store stuff that needs to be sorted through and donated/thrown out.
The trouble with all of this started when I was planning to move with husband #2 and put items in storage in anticipation of that. But then my Mom died and my parent's house was sold. Because my Dad was also very sick, there wasn't time to go through the contents of their house before it sold (we only had two weeks) and I ended up taking boxes of items from their house and just putting it all into storage. But out of sight, out of mind. Everything has continued to sit in a 10 x 20 shed until now when I just can't put off going through my stuff, my parent's stuff and husband #1's stuff any longer. I can't afford it and with the prospect of moving, it has to be eliminated in case I need to store furniture or items that won't fit into an apartment.
Problem #2 - I just don't have much time to go through everything, which is why it has sat for the two years my Mom has been gone. Hopping on over to a storage facility to work on clearing out your parent's old belongings is not up there on the fun parade of things to do. It is depressing and sad to do so. Time consuming and grimy besides. And because the storage site is some miles away, it is another factor preventing much progress on the task.
One of my close girlfriends called me last night having just returned from a trip to her parent's home. She had spent a week there of vacation trying to clean up/clear out the home in preparation of selling it. Her dad is now in an assisted living facility and her mom passed away a few years back. She claimed to have not made much progress in her week there. I laughed as she described how her dad hoarded everything and collected pencils, pens, rubber bands, flashlights, pads of paper and the like. The same with my Dad! In my cleanup of their home, I found a paper bag with probably 500, if not more, book marks! But my parents were not as organized as my friend's parents. There were boxes in my parent's home with papers in them ranging from 1972 - 2002 in no particular order. That made going through things more difficult because I needed to look at all the contents of a box - couldn't just assume it was all from the early disco era!
In talking with my friend, I mentioned that what made me so sad is that the fact that my Dad now lives in an assisted living facility and has no trace of the former life he used to live around him. No need for his extensive pen, pencil and bookmark collection. It is like everything in my parent's home ended up not amounting to very much in the end. My girlfriend understood exactly what I meant - she felt the same way too as she visited her father in his assisted living facility.
In the end, the vast array of stuff we accumulate and surround ourselves with is just junk! Worthless and taking up unnecessary space in the storage sheds or garages of unfortunate relatives left to the task of sorting through all of it. My girlfriend who was divorced in March also has her home on the market to downsize. I commiserated with her that here we are trying to get through the junk in our own lives and also stuck with the task of dealing with the mess of our parents.
These observations have given me the impetus to get through the junk as quickly as possible and to not hold on to much - the bare minimum of memories. It is serving a bit as a guide to how I want to move forward from here - with less clutter and unnecessary items accumulating and stagnating my life.
Today I am grateful:
1. For fireflies.
2. For ladybugs.
3. For butterflies.
4. For cottage cheese with pineapple.
5. For raisin toast.
I know that's a lot of work and I hope it goes quickly for you. I've also been working toward the realization that stuff is just stuff. It's not what's important, and a lot of times it holds you back. I bet you will feel a huge burden lifted off your shoulders once you get it done! Now I hope your post will inspire me enough to go tackle my garage. :)
I keep thinking or the concept that once you get rid of unwanted/unneeded clutter, new and good things will start flowing to you because you've freed up the space (emotionally and physically). A good image to hold on to in the face of clearing out garages!Wonderful.

Last Summer, we introduced the next generation to the City of Lights (and love). We wanted to do something special to remember the occasion, so I asked French Grey Photography to capture us with some of Paris’ iconic images.

As we head into conference play in college basketball, there are generally a team or a small group of teams in most conferences that are viewed as the clear favorites to win the conference. And the betting public is often pretty good at finding these winners. To keep things interesting, though, our goal here is to look at some of those top conference contenders to see which ones could be vulnerable and don't therefore offer as much value for bettors as some people might think. Here are four such giants that could hit a rough patch and be caught and passed by a conference rival. (Posted odds are odds to win the national title)

Arizona (+1000): The Wildcats came into the season seemingly poised to be at least a No. 2 seed in the tournament and perhaps even better. In four days at Atlantis, though, the team's woes were really exposed. They lost three straight tournament games in the Battle 4 Atlantis - N.C. State, SMU and Purdue. There isn't a lot of embarrassment in any of those losses in isolation, but this team shouldn't be losing them and certainly shouldn't be in a situation where they are letting losses stack up. They beat themselves, and that is a real concern going forward. The Pac-12 is lousy this year, and that is a gift and a curse for this team. On the plus side, they should have a fairly sizable margin for error in conference play. On the other hand, even if they play perfect basketball their conference wins may not be enough to help the climb back into major contention for a high seed. I don't think that that is a major concern, though, because the toughness of this team - or lack of it - is an ongoing concern.
Kentucky (+1400): Kentucky always tends to get a bit more respect than they deserve from the betting public - it's the power of the brand. This year we have the combination of a roster that isn't quite as talented as it has been in recent years and an SEC that is much more competitive than it has been in a long time. It's not that Kentucky can't win the conference. It's just that them doing so has seemed like an inevitability many years, and it is far from that this year. Texas A&M and Florida are both very legitimate teams in the conference. This is a Kentucky team that bettors need to be careful of this year.
Gonzaga (+3300): The Bulldogs have played two Top 7 teams this year - Villanova and Florida. They lost by 16 and six points, respectively, and proved that while this is a good team it is not the best squad we have seen. The West Coast Conference title has just been an assumption for many years for the team, but Saint Mary's has always been a semi-threat, and they could be again this year. They also have two losses, and they aren't as strong as Gonzaga's, but this is a talented team that could be poised to challenge the Bulldogs if Gonzaga isn't at full strength. Beyond the top two teams, the West Coast isn't particularly great this year, so there is a good chance that - as has often happened - the two games between Gonzaga and Saint Mary's will be the deciding factor in the race for the title. Gonzaga is the better team, but the gap is narrower than it has been at times, and I certainly wouldn't bet all of my money on Gonzaga.
Duke (+400): 1.20 points per possession. That's what Boston College scored en route to their 89-84 upset win over Duke recently. There is only one way that a team scores at that kind of clip - they are playing against a team that is bad at playing defense. What has been striking since last year is that teams have no fear about shooting from beyond the arc against this Blue Devils team. They know they will get their chances, and they aren't afraid of throwing the ball up. The good teams that Duke has played this year all have done the same thing - throw up the three a noticeably significant number of times. And it's not like these Blue Devils are dominant inside, either. It can't be seen as too surprising that they struggle to defend. When you commit to high-end young talent like they have in recent years you can't make defense your first priority. If they can't tighten things up to a reasonable extent then they could be vulnerable in a conference that has some good teams. They may be the national favorites right now, but this is not yet a championship defense.

AdvertisementsDifficulty: Easy-moderate. The preserve has four miles of trails, split by the St. George River. The trails travel over fairly even terrain and include several small bridges.
How to get there: Gibson Preserve has two separate trail networks, and therefore, two trailheads.
To reach the north trail network, start at the center of Searsmont at the Fraternity Village Store and drive west on Route 173 for three miles. The parking lot will be on the left. From the trailhead kiosk, the trail crosses a small meadow and enters the woods.
To reach the south trail network, start at the center of Searsmont and drive west on Route 173 for two miles and turn left onto Ripley Corner Road. Park on the shoulder of the road. Proceed on foot down the road and cross a bridge over St. George River. After the bridge, take the first right onto the overgrown woods road. Walk approximately 0.25 mile to the preserve entrance on the right, a footpath that leads to a trailhead kiosk.
Information: The 124-acre Gibson Preserve is named after Charles Dana Gibson and Kay Gibson, who gifted the land to the Georges River Land Trust in 1999. Today, the preserve features approximately four miles of walking trails that are open to the public year round for hiking, cross-country skiing and snowshoeing. The trails are well-marked with blue blazes and travel over relatively even terrain; yet walkers should still be careful of their footing. Exposed roots and wooden bog bridges require attention.
The preserve’s two trail networks are separated by the St. George River, which runs through the property from northwest to southeast. The land trust plans to construct a bridge over the river that will connect the two trail networks, but as of October 2013, the bridge was yet to be built.
The 225-square-mile St. George River watershed extends from Montville to Port Clyde, where the 51-mile-long river flows into Muscongus Bay. The Georges River Land Trust mission is “to conserve the ecosystems and traditional heritage of the Georges River watershed region through permanent land protection, stewardship, education, and outdoor experiences. Today, the land trust stewards 54 properties (39 conservation easements and 15 preserves).
The Gibson Preserve is managed for “high quality of wildlife habitat.” Hunting is not allowed on the property and dogs must be kept on leash at all times. A natural resources inventory found five amphibians, three reptiles, 59 birds and 14 mammals. And the forest was estimated to be about 40-50 years old, according to the land trust website.
Personal note: My dog Oreo and I explored the north trail network of the Gibson Preserve on Oct. 19, a sunny and unseasonably warm Saturday. While Oreo enjoyed the various scents of the forests and fields (his nose often buried under leaves), I enjoyed the preserve’s vibrant colors — the occasional beech tree, with its bright yellow-orange leaves; the forest floor, covered with orange pine needles and golden ferns; the deep blue sky reflecting in the St. George River; the red maple leaves floating in the streams; and the rich green conifer stands.
About a third of the way through our hike, we stopped to watch a group of chickadees, which I’ve learned from various birding websites is called a “banditry.” As winter nears, it’s comforting to know that the black-capped chickadee, of all the animals that roam Maine’s forests, will continue to visit me during my various hikes. Adult chickadees don’t migrate, according to the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. It knows its home so well that it stashes seeds and other food in thousands of hiding spots to be retrieved and eaten later.
I learned a lesson on this hike that I’d like to share with you. Keep track of your sunglasses, especially during leaf peeping season. About halfway through the hike, at the far end of the large loop trail, I looked up at an especially beautiful beech tree and my Ray Bans slipped off the top of my head. Of course, I didn’t notice until I got back in Fred the Forester. So Oreo and I had to hike the whole trail network again (this time at triple the pace) looking for the glasses. Fortunately, I remembered looking up at the tree and shooting video (the clip seen at the beginning of the “1-minute hike” video), so I had an inkling of where I’d find the glasses. On the bright side, Oreo was happy to go for a fast walk and burn off some energy.You may want to search:

| CNS News
From left to right: Humanexus creators Norbert Herber, Ying-Fang Shen, and Katy Börner
Humanexus has done it again.
The film just received four more awards in a single weekend at three different film festivals around the country. They include Best Short Animation at the Albany FilmFest in Albany, CA, Best Animated Short at the Richmond International Film Festival in Richmond, VA, and the Documentary Shorts Award and Best Director Award at the Macon Film Festival in Macon, GA.
Ying-Fang Shen’s animated film depicts the ever-accelerating spread of information and communication over the course of human history. It’s perhaps fitting, then, that the film itself has been caught up in a similar momentum, with buzz about Humanexus and recognition for Shen building rapidly over the past year. Click here to see the film's full list of accolades.
Humanexus: Knowledge and Communication Through the Ages is the product of a close collaboration between Shen and Indiana University professor Katy Börner, an expert in the theory and practice of data mining and information visualization who suggested the initial story and provided guidance and resources along the way..Tesco Pickled Sliced Beetroot 340G

Business InformationSaturday Night and Sunday Morning (1960) Directed by Karel Reisz
Nick:
I was just about aware around the age of four, it's about as far back as my memory goes, of a lot of the things that appear in Saturday Night and Sunday Morning. I mean that in a sense of the cars in this film could still be found on the streets of Britain in the early 70's, middle-aged men had quiffs, obviously the overriding influence of Elvis and Jimmy Dean on popular culture still reverberating. Those same middle-aged men were wearing the late 50's tailored suit style as opposed to the Hippy Look. Working in factories. Council houses. My father ticked all these boxes. He was an Italian version of Albert Finney's Arthur Seaton. Certainly that's how I remember him when I was four.
My father wasn't as angry as Seaton is in Saturday Night and Sunday Morning. Or maybe he was. Working class. Kitchen sink drama. It's this anger that still gives the picture its power. Forget Seaton's womanizing and boozing, that's his only way to crush the boredom and his injustice of being born the wrong side of the tracks. Seaton describes his parents as "They have a TV set and a packet of fags, but they're both dead from the neck up." Seaton's different: "I'm out for a good time - all the rest is propaganda!" or as Morrissey might say "Don't let the bastards grind you down!" Yes, pop culture has loved this film, even The Arctic Monkeys have got in on the act of taking their first album title from Seaton spew."
And that's why this is a landmark film and still resonates. We're all comfortable now, middle class, wanting anything we can get in our privileged lives. But the Arthur Seatons of this world still exist, waiting to tear down your dream-houses, pissing on your front door questioning your reason for living. Me? I'm with Seaton.
Astrid:
I had heard talk of the English kitchen sink drama, but never seen one until Saturday Night – Sunday Morning. If some Russians have managed to spy on the American way of suburban life á la 2000s, I feel like a spy entering the Northern English way of life of the 1960s.
This is the scruffy side of cinema, where glamor appears ridiculous and distant. The narrative and the camera are working towards creating 'reality'. Documenting the present in order to preserve the experience. It just so happens that in 2010 this 'reality' appears aesthetically more coherent and romantic than our own.
Arthur (Finney) is coarse and angry. Yet, he is endearing in his boyish manner. From the beginning of the film we gather that he is rebelling inside of his claustrophobic surroundings. He has an awareness of something bigger, newer and more free. However, during the course of the film his character becomes more and more tangled in the restricting conventions of his village.
Saturday Night – Sunday Morning offers excellent acting especially in the scenes between the main character and his older and married lover and then with his new young girlfriend. It is painful to see the married woman's loneliness as she considers abortion because she is expecting her lover's child. It is fun to witness the awkward exchanges between the beautiful new girlfriend and Arthur, as they develop a kind of love.
Will Arthur break away from the life ahead of him and move to a big city in the southern parts of England? The film doesn't tell. But in a way, many of the Arthurs of 'the real world' did.Holabird Advocate

Holabird Found on Facebook
It started out as an ordinary at the home office, when all of the sudden, we were notified that Shannon Walls posted to our Facebook page. Shannon's son, Hunter Mees, helped bring about something wonderful into our lives about 7 years ago, just by getting cancer.
Hunter's story began with an article in the Wessington Springs newspaper. It was picked up by South Dakota Magazine, then we picked it up, and by the time we set it back down, people all over the state were talking about it, people were getting their hair cut, and giving money to the tune of $30,000.
The world has changed a whole lot in those 7 years. Since then, blogging has given way to other social media, our Publisher picked up a BA degree, and Hunter is cancer free and playing high school basketball. Being a small part of the effort in Hunter's cure has become our most prized accomplishment. While some criticize the Internet, it can't be denied that had it not been created, Hunter's cure would have had to have come from somewhere else. Technology has it's place.
Our Publisher has a page on MySpace, Facebook, and Twitter. And yet Blogger is still his favorite form of media, social or otherwise. The Holabird Advocate has a Facebook page as well, where people can go to get all the inside scoop on what we're up to.
When 1st and 2nd Amendments Collide by Jerry Hinkle
The recent flap over Bob Costas speaking his mind on guns last Sunday proves that both sides of the issue need to step back and look at the other side. After Costas made those remarks, a lot of people became offended, or at least claimed to be, and demanded that he be fired.
In much the same way, when Hank Williams Jr. made some so called offensive remarks, not only were there calls to get him fired, but those calls were answered almost immediately after the fact. For now, it appears that Mr. Costas will keep his job. That's good, because it would be sad for anyone to lose their job at Christmastime!
I find it hard to believe that this country is so polarized that they throw a fit over anything that a sportscaster says. Then again whenever these kinds of issues get brought up, people get their undies in a bunch. As for me, I was not offended by any of Mr. Costas's remarks. He felt compelled to share them, I listened. even though i didn't quite agree with everything he said, I was never offended.
I believe in both the 1st and 2nd amendments. I feel free to speak my mind and deal with the results when it goes bad. That's what a blogger does. I have to speak my mind. When someone gets offended they stop reading, them I'm sunk! Still that is what makes America the best country in the world. We can disagree, but there is plenty of room for all opinions.
I don't own a gun, and at present have no use for one. But I'm glad I live in a country where I can choose to get one if I so desire. Should I choose to, it is my responsibility to learn the proper way to handle a gun. As corny as it sounds, it's true that guns don't kill people. My dad has a 30-06. It has killed everything from rabbits, coyotes, raccoons, skunks and deer. never has it killed a person. The only way it could, is if someone who did not have my dad's moral compass and his careful aim was to use it. The gun didn't kill that football player's girlfriend. it was the football player himself. It's sad bit true! It's not a gun culture, it's a hate culture. You can take away the gun, but removing the hate is a whole heap harder! God be with you and do the best you can!

Here's a great bedtime book for the Christmas season. These are very short personal memories about Christmas from over a dozen writers, many stressing stories of hard times during the Depression and World War II, when an orange and some candy was an exciting gift and that one special gift, even if it was used, could make your day. Some stories are about a child giving up a beloved gift to someone else who has nothing. All are heartwarming, although some are rather amateurish in style.
Take Joy!, Tasha Tudor
From childhood reading the unforgettable The Secret Garden, I was in love with Tasha Tudor's lovely, delicate drawings and watercolors. I ended up buying a hardback of Secret Garden simply to get her color illustrations. Take Joy! is a mixed confection of a few Christmas stories and poems, Christmas music, small legends of Christmas, and a section talking of Christmas preparations at Tudor's Vermont farm, all liberally decorated with color and black-and-white illustrations of birds, children, biblical figures, Christmas plants, decorations, homes and fields of snow, animals, and of course the corgis of Tasha's "Corgi Cottage." For Christmas and Tudor lovers everywhere!Bell Restoration Fund
Are your church’s bells in need of restoration or repair? If so, and if your church is within the Diocese of Leicester (which covers Leicestershire), we may be able to assist with a grant.
The Leicester Diocesan Guild Bell Restoration Fund (BRF) is a separate registered charity 508748, set up by the Leicester Diocesan Guild of Church Bell Ringers and controlled by its General Committee. Its object is to provide financial assistance through grants to churches within the Diocese of Leicester, for the purpose of improving their bell installations. Improvements might include work on existing bells, fittings or frames, or work in connection with new bells and augmentations.
To assist with the running of the fund there are two separate committees:
- The BRF Fundraising Committee provides support to towers wishing to raise funds for their own bell restoration projects, organises fund-raising events and supports the Guild's districts in raising money for the Bell Restoration Fund.
- The BRF Allocations Committee meets annually to consider all applications received for grants from the Bell Restoration Fund, before making recommendations to the General Committee.
You can download a short report which summarises the finances of the fund and the grant allocations agreed.
The BRF Fund-raising Committee runs a 100CLUB as part of its fund-raising activities.ISLAMABAD: Following the Jamaat-e-Islami adjournment motion in National Assembly and senate, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf (PTI) has also submitted the adjournment motion in senate to discuss Zainab murder, who was kidnapped, raped and killed in Kasur few days ago.

Comentarii recenteBy Achilleas Antoniades
I woke up at 5.30. It’s been a bad night. My sleep was interrupted several times. Anxiety set in my soul since the late afternoon. I got out of bed unable to sleep or think. I am sitting on the balcony overlooking some watermelon fields and bunches of acacia trees in Kapparis Bay. Some houses are further away and even further away is the sea. I can hardly see it.
Forty-three years after the catastrophe of the Turkish invasion and four years after an own-made financial catastrophe my tiny country is still desperately gasping for air.
It is still searching for survival. You probably wouldn’t know it if you strolled along the golden sandy beaches and the promenades and board walks along the seafront. The thousands of tourists busily and noisily filling up all spaces would tell you this is a thriving place: Thriving on the outside. These are the people who would disappear in no time with the first shot being fired. The buffer zone, where the Turkish troops stopped their advance in August 1974 is literally just around the corner.
We saw it yesterday afternoon. It disturbed me. I had seen it before but this time it is different. In the distance, sprawling along the seafront is the ghost city of Famagusta. Its name in Greek, Ammohostos, means buried in sand. It is indeed buried in the golden sand but for the moment it is also buried under the boot of the occupying military power.
Since 1974 it is under the control of the Turkish army. It was not in their military objectives, but they captured it when its inhabitants fled to save their lives. The UN Security Council, recognising that this was a major mistake, made decisions with the force of international law holding the Turkish government directly responsible for the future of the city and calling for them to return it to its citizens. Bang on a deaf person’s door as much as you want. You won’t get an answer. So goes a Cypriot saying. The Turkish deaf ears have been holding Famagusta hostage for 43 years now. It has dishonestly been holding it and dangling it in front of Greek Cypriot faces as an incentive for them to sign the agreement that Turkey demands.
It is now a city of ghosts. Uninhabited, derelict, engulfed in a gray mood of abandonment, of death. I saw the ghosts yesterday afternoon. They were hovering over the city, together with news that the Turks are about to re-conquer it by allowing their own people to move in and inhabit the properties of the Greek Cypriots.
We drove to Dherynia, the closest town to the buffer zone. We went straight to the house we knew there was an observation post on the roof. We wanted to see the corpse lying there for 43 years. Probably for the last time. After ringing and ringing an old man from next door peered his head out of the front door and told us the observation post was closed down. “No more visitors,” he said. “It was not worth keeping it open.” The owner was a Greek Cypriot woman named Annita, who had returned from the UK.
I remember her as a vivacious polyglot who wanted the whole world to see the shame of the ghost town. Now she was put to shame by having to close down her protest move.
The old man explained to us where another observation post had been established, further into town. It was a restaurant with an attractive garden. The owner was about to leave for the day, it was 7 o’clock. Not much business at this part of town. But he encouraged us to open the gate, go up the staircase and look as much as we wanted. And he drove off. That’s what you call trust. We did, picking a fig or two on the way up, from the tree at the corner of the garden.
A mantle with a half a dozen sets of binoculars was standing on the northern side of the terrace. A horizontal bar was meant to steady the hands holding the binoculars. Obviously, the expectation was that people would stare for a long time. We certainly did. We tried to spot the buildings, name the empty hotels, wonder why the cranes on unfinished building sites had not been taken down, probably a public threat by now. But the absurdity of the thought immediately becomes evident. What public? The rats and snakes roaming freely in the broken streets?
A building that stands out is the St. Nicholas Cathedral, a remnant from the Venetian and Lusignian times. The kings of Jerusalem used to be crowned here. A magnificent gothic structure, massive but elegant. Now it is a mosque, a minaret piercing the sky.
Sad, sad, as US President Trump likes to say. I wonder if he would appreciate what his country could do to change the sadness of Mrs Maria we meet on the way out. She is sweeping the ground. She stops to ask where we are from and encourages us to pick more figs, befriend the two grandchildren. She is the aunt of the young man who had just left.
Her husband and in-laws were from Famagusta. They are all dead now, gone with the nostalgia of returning to their home in their hearts. They owned a small hotel in Famagusta and her husband was saving to have it repaired when- he never lost hope- they would return. She is bitter. But she is realistic.
“The Turks,” she blurts out, “are not the kind of people to give anything back. Grab them and throw them all in the sea. That’s when they will leave.”
Our sadness is compounded by a story she tells of a man who for 43 years comes to this place every day. He looks at the white house a short distance away, his own house and asks everybody “When am I going to go back?” Poor man. He probably does not know, or does not want to know that the Turks will never give his house back. Greed is not an uncommon phenomenon in times of war. Who is going to make them see justice?
At the same time, she is cynical about the fate of her land.
“You lost and we gained” the villagers down the coast keep telling her. They are now millionaires having harvested the windfall from the rapid tourist development.
“What can you do?” she bemoans. “At least some tourists come this way and our restaurant has some business. If our children work hard they will make it.”
It is Mrs Maria’s determination that saves the day. She is not giving up, she says. Maybe her sons and nephews will compromise with reality in order to survive but she won’t. She has nothing else to live for. The ghosts of Famagusta are hovering around her and me. A sleepless night is a small price to pay for remembering the suffering of others. It is a small tribute to those who this weekend are marking the 43rd anniversary of the accidental and tragic conquering of their city.

deletes all files on a hard drive is circulating on the Internet,
according to the Energy Department.
The agency's Computer Incident Advisory Capability unit says this is
different from the AOL4FREE virus warning hoax message that had been
widely circulated earlier. Trojan horses are not dubbed viruses
because they do not spread to other computers, but they can still
seriously damage the PC that is attacked.
The program has been sent to at least several hundred people and
probably more, said William Orvis, a member of the Computer Incident
Advisory Capability team. He said the presence of the two
programs--the AOL4FREE virus, which is a hoax, and the Trojan horse
AOL4FREE.COM--could create confusion.
"We would like people to stop passing around the hoax message, because
they get people worried about something that isn't real," Orvis said.
"Now there is a real program out there by a similar name that will
thrash your machine."
A message on the Energy Department's Web site reads: "CIAC has
obtained a Trojaned copy of the AOL4FREE.COM program that, if run,
deletes all the files on a user's hard drive. If you are emailed this
file or if you have downloaded it from an online service, do not
attempt to run it."
It goes on to say that if the program is received as an email
attachment, users should not attempt to open it.
Computers that run on Windows-based PCs are susceptible to the
program, the agency says. The original AOL4FREE was a Macintosh
program for fraudently creating free AOL accounts, according to the
Web site. The program's creator has pleaded guilty to defrauding AOL.hourglass cold brew coffee maker instructions cold brew coffee maker cold brew coffee maker coffee maker reviews good housekeeping.

There is not a universal term to describe or a universal recipe for success to effectively market to local communities on a one to one basis. What is universal is that just about all consumer businesses need to succeed from a local store marketing perspective if they are going to succeed from a financial perspective. Local Store Marketing is essential to building long term strength in the brand and the local communities. In most competitive categories, the fight for share of dollars is won by a brand’s ability to win the local store battles in the immediate trade area.
Many brands choose to use location (store) managers and leaders to serve as the voice of the brand at a local level. However, with all of the other demands on a local manager’s time, it is not a realistic concept that these managers can be a consistent and effective marketer at the local level. E3 Local believes that the first step in Local Store Marketing success is keeping managers in the units, focusing on their product quality and customer service excellence. Leave the Local Store Marketing to the teams that can manage it effectively, accurately and responsively.

Jamshedpur: Six days after Kolhan commissioner Birendra Mohan Kumar issued arrest orders for open defecators, East Singhbhum and Seraikela-Kharsawan police have not managed to nab a single person doing the deed.
East Singhbhum's Jamshedpur and Seraikela-Kharsawan's Adityapur have crowded localities near rivers Subernarekha and Kharkai where people defecate openly on banks and under bridges. Also, railway tracks, deserted fields and bushes at strategic places are haunts for those who don't use toilets.
Thousands of urban slum residents, migrant labour and the homeless - many being women and children - sully these spaces.
But, till Sunday, despite the commissioner's order that patrolling teams be deployed 24/7, the police have not managed to arrest an offender
While Seraikela-Kharsawan SP Chandan Sinha hailed the order as a "good step to instil fear among offenders", he also admitted that they could not arrest anyone so far.
DSP (headquarters II) Kailash Karmali, under whose jurisdiction river areas of Kadma and Sonari in Jamshedpur fall, told the paper on Sunday they could not spot anyone openly defecating but added patrolling was being done as per orders.
Sonari thana OC Anuj Kumar admitted scores of slum dwellers defecated in the open, especially along the Subernarekha and also the Kadma-Sonari Marine Drive. "We will definitely act against them," he said.
Policemen off the record said the rains last week impeded their efforts. Many also expressed doubts over the protocol to arrest women and children if caught defecating. "Mahila police patrolling will also have to be deployed in such cases," a policeman said.
Kolhan commissioner Kumar who issued the order last week, said he was inspecting Chhath ghats along Kharkai at Adityapur when residents drew his attention to filth due to open defecation.
"The government is providing septic tank to every individual household and community septic tanks to stop open defecation. Still, some people relieve themselves in the open as a habit. I decided to immediately put the onus on police patrolling teams to bring an end to the practice," commissioner Kumar said.You have heard of the parable of the sower before. It is recorded in Mark 4 and in Matthew 13. We will not copy it here because of its length. But essentially, you have a sower who went out to sow (Mark 4:3). Some seeds fall by the way side (verse 4) and the fowls of the air devour them. Some fall on stony ground (verse 5), then grow immediately because there is no much dirt. However, when the sun comes up, they die quickly. Others fall among thorns (verse 7), but they are chocked by them when those thorns grow up. And some fall on good ground (verse 8), and end up yielding fruits in abundance and even superabundance. We shall call them “way side”, “stony ground”, “among thorns” and “good ground”.
Our Lord Jesus explains this parable in Mark 4:14-20. In all four cases, the ground refers to people, the seed is the Word of God, and all four types of people “hear” the Word (verses 15, 16, 18 and 20). However, only two of the four types (“stony ground” and “good ground”) actually “receive” the Word.
This said, a little study of the two verbs “to hear” and “to receive” (or “to accept” depending on the version of your bible) reveals that much of the real meaning of this parable has been lost in most English translations.
It’s about HOW you Hear!
Mark 4: 20 – But these are the ones sown on good ground, those who hear the word, accept it, and bear fruit: some thirtyfold, some sixty, and some a hundred.”
When looking at how the verb “to hear” is conjugated in each of the four cases, we find that only in the case of the good ground (verse 20) is this verb in the “Present Indicative Active”. In other words, this is the only group of people that hear and keep hearing continuously the Word of God! These people are plugged to Christ!
In stark contrast, the same verb is in the “Aorist” tense in all of the first three groups (“way side”, “stony ground” and “among thorns”). This tense means that this action of hearing is not continuous or habitual. The reason for them not producing fruit is because they do not keep on hearing the Word of Christ.
So what about the stony ground? The only other group mentioned as receiving the Word?
Mark 4:16 – And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground; who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with gladness;
Not only did they “receive” it, but our Lord says that they receive it “immediately” and “with gladness”. But then our Lord says that they “immediately” stumble when tribulation comes because they have no root (verse 17). Ouch! What went wrong?
It’s about HOW you Receive!
See, we already established that the first problem with all the groups except good ground is that they do not make it a habit to hear the Word. In the worst case, they hear it one time and that is it. But now focusing on the verb “to receive”, we see that in the case of stony ground (verse 16), the greek verb is lambano, while in the case of good ground it is the greek verb para-dechomai. In a nutshell, these two verbs focus on two “very” different aspects of the reception process.
Lambano emphasizes the manifestation of what has been received while para-dechomai emphasizes the strong and loving acceptance of what has been received. An example of lambano is found in Acts 19, where Paul ends up laying His hand on some people so they may receive (lambano) the Holy Spirit.
Acts 19:2,6 – He said unto them, Have ye received (lambano) the Holy Ghost since ye believed?… 6 And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Ghost came on them; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied.
There was a clear manifestation/evidence of the reception: They spoke with tongues and prophesied. In the case of the stony ground, the manifestation is that they immediately start to speak or preach what they have just been taught. How do we know? Verse 17 says that it is for “the Word’s sake that they face tribulations”. They do not just get tribulations for any reason. They are attacked specifically on their faith. But that faith is weak because they do not continue to hear! They are batteries and they run out, they are not plugs!
Para-dechomai is actually a stronger form of the verb “decomai” and it is used only 6 times in the New Testament. One of the other five is this great record in Hebrews.
Hebrews 12:6 – My son, do not despise the chastening of the Lord, Nor be discouraged when you are rebuked by Him; 6 For whom the Lord loves He chastens, And scourges every son whom He receives (para-dechomai).
Can you sense the intense love God has for us? How He receives us? And by the way, this is also in the present tense, meaning, the Lord continually receives us! Wow!! Want to talk about being accepted by Him? Here you have it!
So what’s the deal here? “Good ground” hears and keeps on hearing the Word. As a result, he starts to accept and receive this Word, becoming one with it, loving it, making it his very own. He cannot get enough of it! So he never forgets that he needs to stay plugged, and as a result, he produces fruits in the most natural of ways, and even in great abundance. Stony ground hears it once, gets extremely excited. Heck, it seems to be the most excited of all! But then he takes the little he received and runs with it. What a pity! Why do you leave? You are battery on your own, and soon after, you are out of juice!
What is the takeaway? Stay plugged! Keep on hearing! Let’s not focus on what we can do, like stony ground did. The Word calls that our works. Instead, let’s focus on being close to Him, simply listening to Him, day in and day out (2 Timothy 1:9). Bearing fruits is not about exerting effort of our own, but about letting His Word dwell in us richly! He who drinks from Him (i.e. He who hears Him) will never thirst and out of him will flow rivers of living waters (John 7: 37, 38 – you want to talk about producing fruits?!).Hotel reservation

Make Do and Mend Attitude
The Make do and Mend Attitude started during WWII, it all began with clothing and fabric rations. Ladies started to re purpose their curtains and blankets into clothing (I have a really cute war time jumper style dress made out of a quilted blanket). This philosophy carried over to other parts of their lives and households.
I like to make do and mend whenever possible (now the term is reduce, reuse, and recycle but I still like to say make do and mend instead). One example of this is: I like to buy things in the bulk but I end up with lots of things sitting around in little bags in my cupboards which is pretty unsightly when you have really pretty, old time paned glass front cupboards like I do. I was going to go out and buy neat, tidy, and uniform plastic containers but what fun would that be? So I had to come up with a creative alternative that also included a bit of recycling... I mean making do!
I started saving my jars that I have from different food items and when the food was all gone I washed them up and air dried them for many hours. I ended up with a nice assortment of shapes and sizes including some really great glass milk jugs which make great containers for flour and almond meal. I am still not done, this is a work in progress and will be until every last thing has a place and a pretty glass jar of its own.

Things to do around Barcelona
Barcelona, a part of the charm and beauty of this city is that it is surrounded by many wonderful places that you can visit, especially if you’ve already been to the city a few times before and are looking for something new. If you’ve never been to the Catalan capital before then it may be best that you check out the Barcelona accommodation on offer in the city center and plan a trip within the city walls. Otherwise, to get the most out of your trip, you can rent an apartment that will enable you to see the best of the inner city and the surrounding area by renting a bit further from the center. You’ll save money too as quality apartments away from the center are cheaper to stay in.
Girona
The city of Girona is 100km from Barcelona and was founded as in 77BC, as such, this beautiful place has a rich history. You can stroll through the picturesque streets around the center and see the cathedral with the largest gothic nave in the world. You can also take photos of the charming characteristic houses which stretch across the river.
Costa Brava
One of the best places to visit across Barcelona, full of an array of destinations. This region consists of 200 miles of coast north of Barcelona, from Blanes to Portbou. There’s a varied landscape too, from small fishing villages to medieval towns and mid-sized cities. If you had to choose only 2 places to visit though, then it’s recommended you check out Tossa de Mar and Roses.
Figueres
You can find Figueres 136 km from Barcelona. It’s one of the most important cities on the Costa Brava and capital of the region Alt Emportdà. The importance of visiting this location is owing to the fact that it was the birthplace of Dalí, and in every corner, you can practically breathe in his art. It is, therefore, home to an impressive Dalí museum, with the best of surrealist art on show.
Sitges
The town of Sitges is another place to visit near Barcelona. There are many medieval elements of the town that are still preserved and it has a rich cultural heritage because it was a landmark place for modernist intellectuals.
Montaña de Montserrat
The mountain of Montserrat is one of the most interesting places to visit near Barcelona. It’s practically an icon of the city, and of Catalonia too. Here you will find the famous monastery which houses a statue of the Virgin Mary, black, the patron saint of Catalonia.
La Montaña de la sal – CardonaBarcelona surrounding areas
In English, it translates to “The Salt Mountain” is a monument geographically located close to Barcelona and is exactly what it says that it is. It’s little over an hour away from Barcelona. These salt mines were one of the most important exports in Europe. They are found in the “Parc Cultural de la Muntanya de Sal”, which were founded in 1997. In front of the min is the Castle of Cardona, built between the ninth and twelfth century. A location well worth visiting.
Next time you land in the Catalan capital, you don’t have to settle for just seeing the city. Expand your horizons, and tour the entire region of Barcelona. It’s recommended that if you want to do this then you should rent a car. If for whatever reason you can’t, then some of the places are well connected with public transport (like Montserrat, Sitges, Girona) but you’ll have to plan in advance. Once you’ve exhausted the Barcelona region you can even consider moving on to Madrid, where you can stay in a Madrid apartment.Shania Twain

Social Background
Backgrounds were designed to help players and Game Masters flesh out the backgrounds of beginning fantasy characters, providing them with a skill set that will follow them throughout their entire adventuring career. Backgrounds are not strictly required, but may act as a starting point, combined with your character’s Social Station, to help determine not only appropriate Aspects, but options for your character’s starting skills. The below lists of skills are merely examples of those learned in typical occupational backgrounds. These lists give no bonuses, but merely suggestive ideas.
Backgrounds use occupations to reflect a player character’s former livelihood, taking “occupation” in its loosest sense: how did a player character occupy his time prior to adventuring? Each occupation entry offers a brief description and some skill suggestions. Each player character should choose only one occupation, and this occupation is chosen as part of the character creation.
An occupation reflects the player character’s prior life, which normally occurs during adolescence. As such, the fantasy occupations presented here were constructed as adolescent occupations. A beginning warrior character might have been a squire, but he probably would not have been a knight. A beginning initiate might have spent time in temple learning the basics and performing duties, but was probably not ordained, given the rite of initiation, as a priest or cleric before play begins.
Once play begins, a player character may or may not continue in his previous occupation. The skills reflect his proficiency in what he learned, regardless of whether he still follows his old calling. Should the character choose a new occupation, he will choose skills (and stunts) that he acquires normally as he progresses in his career.
Some occupations are more broadly defined than others, due to the same skill set being more broadly applicable. A player character that takes the fisherman occupation was probably a fisherman, getting into a boat and casting nets on a daily basis. A player character with the apprentice occupation, by contrast, could be a butcher or a blacksmith. As a result, player characters that choose a broadly defined occupation should keep their narrow focus in mind when selecting profession or craft skills.
Backgrounds
Human characters have the following backgrounds to choose from. If you wish to play a non-human character, you must consult with the DM prior to play to discuss your character background and class options.

WHY DO I CREATE?
As an Artist who believes in the constant evolution of creativity, my objective is to always “say something” and stretch my imagination more and more. Life is a Choose Your Own Adventure Book and we are the Authors. Similar to the Ocean, I like to dig slightly deeper than just a pretty picture. I truly enjoy the challenges of innovation and creativity. There’s no greater love for me than to be presented with a boring room in a house, business, or community street where I am able to listen to the stories, taste the atmosphere, analyze my surroundings and begin to create a unique concept from paper to its final brushstroke. Within those concepts, if I have the opportunity to add a little “umpf” to the equation, you better believe I will.
My work always has some aspect of concentrated detail, sarcasm, and the contrasts of humanity with a hint of personal struggles in them. I am continuously creating and networking with people from cultures of all walks of life. You will see me during Live Painting Events, customizing works for Businesses and Residences, and posting Works in Progress pics and videos on Social Media. What my clients and curators value in collaborating with me is my confidence, honesty and immeasurable professional work ethics. Due to my own adolescent experiences, I take pride in providing a Voice for the Voiceless. Not necessarily creating imagery on concepts that have never been heard of, but providing a platform to share the struggles of my own and others’, colors, stories, triumphs and allow us all to be vulnerable. I don’t mind sticking up for the minorities, empowering the less confident, the so-called “nerds”, bullied and abused or neglected. Anyone falling short of genuine, organic love.
I am a product of the Post-70’s & 80’s, the Hip-Hop and Metal Movements, the Electronic Music and Tech era, the numerous Athletic Legends, video games, personal computers, social media, the internet, and the swift progression of our world to date. I’ve been truly fortunate to be catapulted and affected by the Art World since my arrival. Looking at imagery and objects always fascinated me. From crayons to pencils to markers to paint….I was always mimicking what I perceived, in some way. Anytime I come across a different medium, I have to try it. I was far from a “natural” since day 1. I welcomed hard work and consistency, which was always a big influence from the strong women of my family. If they could conquer their struggles, so could I.
Subconsciously, I was building my techniques and experimenting with many aspects of the Visual Arts. As a youngster, I was a typical S. Florida-rugged boy. Always needing to be outside and in the elements of Nature. Whether building a fort or climbing a tree, swimming in the ocean, making my Mom nuts by ruining my clothes on a daily… it was always something physical. Getting my hands dirty was just a way of life and the way I connected with the elements around me. Art eventually became a way to channel that, thank God for the local Art Programs. I was able to feed my curiosity since I was 6 years old. I’ve dabbled with almost every medium I could, but working with woods and paints has always been my true Love.
As I began to understand what humanity was doing to trees, taking them from their natural environments in order to create “superficial environments” and convenience for us, I really started collecting and utilizing reclaimed wood more and more. The trees have no say in this. Even I couldn’t stop the massive industries from doing this, but what I could do is to attempt to preserve what I can and give it a new and final voice.
I utilize a Surreal-Organic imagery with bold graphic line work, colorful contrast and the need to make a statement of some kind. I attempt to capture elements of my Past and Present….in hopes to evolve on different intellectual and emotional levels in the Future.
HOW AND WHY THIS ALL BEGAN?
Most people wouldn’t know this by meeting Jacob (his friends call him “Jake”), but he’s a 1st generation American born from his Father (born in Caibarien, Cuba) and his Mother (born in Siberia, Russia), extremely contrasting cultures. These two interesting people immigrated to New York City and were determined to become Americanized. So determined in fact, that they didn’t care to teach his 4 siblings and him either language….way to go parents. They decided to move to Ft. Lauderdale shortly after their honeymoon and it was there, Jake was born. His earliest memories are an intense experience with an immediate feeling of neglect, obscure perceptions of sound, his Mom always under stress, his Father nowhere to be found. Therefore, the hereditary roots created an emotionally driven-intuitive force of nature. Born into a broken system created a means for constant adaptation. Riding the waves of Humanity & Diversity, where struggle is a daily part of life and clearly inevitable. How does one keep their shit together?........FIGHT, FIGHT, FIGHT! The feeling of never being a part of the Inner Circle. Never having the proper stability and structure, to be allowed to stick around long enough to really grasp any of it. His perception of the world was slightly distorted. Unfortunately, he was born with 40% hearing loss in both ears. Since birth, there were tons of sounds he was missing out. Let’s just say, he was easily misunderstood and excluded from the circulating, daily functions at home and school. Even to this day, people think he is ignoring them or not validating their instructions. There were numerous accounts where he was screamed at and punished, for just not acknowledging someone speaking to him. He was brought into a world of strange noises, different languages, wide range of music, startling sounds, and hereditary emotions. He evolved to visualize the world within a muffled version of reality.
His parents divorced shortly after his birth, but they still resided in Florida, where he has remained throughout most of life. Luckily he found his inner voice early, and was able to tune out the chaos with his imagination. He had the opportunity to attend Magnet Schools in Broward County, (Walker Elementary and Parkway Middle) from 3rd-7th grades. Within a 5-year period, he was introduced to such a wide range of Art, Music and Culture. Many of these programs were located in less fortunate neighborhoods and he was perceived as the minority. It was a Culture Shock but beautiful in his eyes, because it was different than the chaos at home. One of his fondest memories were during Black History month and the range of important American icons he was able to create posters of and even participated in school plays. These were the hands-on creative and cultural experiences he had, that could not be learned in a book. The challenges with certain teachers and students, where skin pigment was a subject of hatred and bigotry, which he learned had been going on for hundreds of years. He was now on the other side of the fence and many times physically and mentally abused for “being a white kid in a black neighborhood”, which was just scary. But, he survived. Not everyone would act the same way in this situation. Instead, he embraced the culture, he absorbed the music, the dancing and food. He may have some war scars and may battle an occasional nightmare from time to time. He genuinely feels if he didn’t go through that, he doesn’t believe he would have the perspective of humanity he does today. Mean people are just mean people, and ignorance is scary. It doesn’t possess a skin pigment, it’s a mentality. He’s had his share of fist fights and was toughened up to stand his ground against bullies, and was eventually able to make boundaries clearly understood. One thing’s for certain, he’ll never let that stifle him or compromise his dignity.
Jake’s Mother remarried and had 3 younger siblings. A sister and twin brothers. This was another failed marriage with a lot of physical and emotional abuse circulating the home, and Jake just dove deeper and deeper into his Art to tune out the chaos. His father was never around until Jake was about 7 years old. While running some errands with a friend of his Mom’s, they came across a hung over bum look-alike sleeping on a bench, in Downtown Lauderdale. Shockingly, his Mom’s friend informed Jake that the man sleeping was his Father. Offering this guy a ride and really looking at this man eye-to-eye for his first recollection that this was his Father, really impacted Jake. It’s quite possible that his Father had a moment of realization that, his little baby boy was now a 7 year old. It turns out, his Father decided to really clean up his act and decided to kick his 20+ year disease of alcoholism, and actually be a parent to his older boys. They made weekend and occasional holiday visits to Miami to visit their Father and his Cuban Family. Through adolescent conflicts with his mother, there were continuous battles of misunderstanding, and his mother was really not equipped to raise an opinionated and strong-willed young man. His mother and her Church mentors labeled him to be “unruly” because he stood up for his beliefs and never let up. Even then, he knew what he needed most, and that was a positive household and compassionate Father-figure. This led to his mother wanting to put him in a home for troubled boys. His Father stepped in and a nasty custody battle took place. Upon his Father winning those rights, understanding this was the opportunity to catch up to what he neglected for so long. Jake had an opportunity to begin a new life and live with him at 13 years old. The opportunity to develop a relationship with him was crucial to his growth as a young man.
He moved to Miami and attended a local public middle school (Arvida Middle) in Kendall. Starting the culture shock all over. After only 1 year there he ended up going to a local private school. Again, he had to start all over with a new demographic. By now, he was used to the routine. Fortunately, his father was doing amazingly well with his business and was able to put him in a College Prep School, (Christopher Columbus High School) being a great jump start to his education. There, he learned a lot about the “rich politics” and the “successful Latin Families”. He wasn’t stifled by it, and didn’t let his lack of wealth sway him. He welcomed it and took it as an opportunity to learn. He excelled in Sports (Wrestling, Football and Track) and Academics, also being awarded Art and Academic Awards in the process. Numerous teachers and coaches played a part in molding these gentlemen, a few he still remains in touch with. While there, he continued to create and paint even more and pursued a Bachelors of Fine Arts degree upon graduating in ’97. Those 5 years in Miami were very good to him and are considered some of his fondest moments.
But, it was now time to start all over. He was stoked to attend UCF and to finally be on his own. He felt he was armed with wisdom, confidence and really understood that it was time to pave his own future, away from the Family drama. Along with his pursuit of academics in the Fine Arts, he stumbled across an additional passion. In the beginning of his Freshman year, he walked up to a UCF Rugby booth, signed up for the team and was immediately hooked. Loving the physical demand, hitting and tackling, he put on a “#7 Flanker” jersey and never looked back. Traveling all over the Southeast and continuing the UCF Rugby legacy, were some really great times with some good gentlemen. He went on to play the sport for nearly a decade.
Plagued with challenging circumstances once again, in the beginning of his Sophomore year his father was diagnosed with colon cancer. After numerous chemo therapy treatments and radiation, his Father lost this battle. He and his older brother buried him early February 2000. Not having much opportunity to mourn and faced with the nasty realities of dysfunctional family and estate laws, they were left with nothing. For whatever reasons, his Father never wrote a Will or even attempted to solidify his last requests. Hoping during this time of loss, the Family would come together and support each other, it went the complete opposite. Many deep-rooted arguments between siblings erupted, several dark lies and deceptions were resurfacing. Jake’s older brother sifted through some medical records and found out cancer only wiped his Father out, but was not the core disease he was battling for over 15 years. This robbed any memory these siblings had about their lives with him. It brought a cold, sick feeling to their guts and made them question everything and everyone. He was then faced with a constant fear and realization that he was not equipped to become a successful adult. At 20 years old Jake realized his ignorance with business ethics, he lacked the trust in humanity in order to have genuine relationships, and lacked the confidence to parent his own child, someday. He was overwhelmed with the tasks ahead of him and knew he had to grow up, quickly. This was the epitome of feeling “alone” and “misunderstood”. It was a crazy, emotional rollercoaster but he possessed an inner fight and was determined to face any obstacle head on, almost blindly. Graduating within a 4-year plan was thrown out the window. He worked 2-3 jobs to put himself through school and pay for his Fine Arts degree. His schedule was overbearing, but his focus was intense. He would clean residential pools, take classes, install graphic signage, take more classes, work at a restaurant till 3am, play Rugby and racquetball during any free time, and do the same thing the next day. He barely slept. He had the privilege to continue to play Rugby and eventually be Captain of the Team, even transitioning to the local Orlando Men’s League (Iron Horse Rugby) before life and injuries took a toll. He finally received his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in 2004. He accomplished all of this on his own, but was heartbroken that he didn’t have all the people he cared about there to celebrate with him. He just channeled that back into his work.
Slowly Rugby withered away, but drawing and painting only intensified. There was more studio time and the demand for school had diminished. Most people stop creating 5 years after they graduated. He was just getting started! Now it was time for him to start really building a personal portfolio and begin exhibiting and putting his stamp on the current Art Scene. Creating and experimenting with mediums has been the only constant, going on 32 years of his life. He was part of the Orlando Visual Artists League, participating in Juried Exhibits and Exhibitions for local businesses. With most business focus towards the theme parks and hospitality markets, the Art market in Orlando was very slow and he was determined to be financially stable doing what he loved. He decided to liquidate his belongings, move to Miami for 6 months and cut any Florida ties in order to relocate. Things did not go quite as he planned. Jake was blessed to cross paths with his gorgeous and amazing wife. He decided to remain in Miami so they could begin building their own foundation. He understood earlier on, the Art Industry was competitive and there was more to the Art Business than just being talented. He’s always striving for longevity, and made it a point to get hands-on working knowledge of the Art Industry. What better way to get a few notches in his belt, than working for 2 of Miami’s biggest Art Gallery Empires (Britto Central and Peter Lik Gallery). His leadership personality and team work ethics always landed him in Management positions. These Corporate endeavors humbled him in many ways. He took infrastructure notes for his own Empire, someday.He gradually began building his own Artistic endeavors. Now with 2 amazing kids and still working full-time, he began showcasing his works in local Exhibitions, Events and is frequently called upon for Live Painting gigs. Up to date, he’s had pieces seen on major networks such as MTV2, Showtime, Spike TV and even licensed some pieces to NBC-Universal Studios. He is the sole apparel designer for UFC Veteran Ben “Killa B” Saunders. The task of relevancy spawned custom mural commissions for schools, businesses and private residences. He’s been fortunate enough to have numerous commissions on numerous surfaces such as walls, wood, canvas, apparel, surfboards, skateboards….you name it, he’s applied his creativity to it. He’s not known for being a mass production artist, but the sky is the limit. He’s taken great pride in paying close attention to clientele and customizing imagery to really catch the Creative Vibe in the moment. He truly enjoys the visual experimentation. Some aspects of the Art World and the way certain people run the business may be a little distorted, but that will only make his genuine approach to business stand out and people will continue to enjoy working with him.
“I truly love people, their personal journeys and listening to their visions to enhance their spaces(s). There’s something beautiful in everyone and everywhere. I am glad I have an additional voice and use it to identify that beauty in my work. Let’s collaborate some more!”

Christmas break was too long ago and spring break isn't soon enough. actually, it's in less than a month, but that still seems so far away! i can't wait to go to california! my valentine's day was pretty boring. we had to go out to eat fried catfish for k-dogg's grandma's 80th b-day. yes, that's the family with all of the boyfriends and girlfriends and his cousins that really make you wonder...
anyway, i gotta go see if the big bang theory is new tonight!

bbt was a rerun! =(
I've never been on a jury either, though, I've been called a lot to show up for the weeding out process. Because I was in the military and now I'm the main caretaker of our kiddos, I have never had to actually show up for just the processing part. I'm grateful because I probably couldn't stand the stupidity or I would get chosen for one of those long and drawn out cases and end up going crazy!:) Anyway, I would like to request a picture of these new shoes. I'm having a hard time picturing them...
i've only been called to jury duty once, and that was after i had moved from the county.Shalom Freedman

Poem Submitted: Monday, February Can Be Written In Five Minutes by Shalom FreedmanGlobalization environment. This creates a moral dilemma: American firms often need to buy supplies from the developing world to remain competitive, but doing so might come at the cost of the exploitation of foreign workers and environmental damage.
In a new working paper, UC Hastings professor Jodi Short, along with Yanhua Z. Bird and Michael W. Toffel of Harvard Business School, study two strategies American firms deploy in response to this dilemma to promote human rights abroad: “legalization” and “worker participation.” Legalization involves using law-like rules and standards to improve working conditions, such as requiring suppliers to obtain certification from a non-governmental organization attesting to the adequacy of their labor practices. Some legalization strategies have become familiar to American consumers. For example, many coffee shops sell certified “fair trade” coffee where the certification indicates that the coffee was produced without, among other things, the use of child labor. Alternatively, worker-participation strategies aim to increase the voice of employees in the workplace. For example, Reebok requires its suppliers to inform workers of their legal rights and to establish formal communication channels and processes. Unionization is another common worker-participation strategy.
In their new study, Professor Short and her coauthors look for evidence about the efficacy of legalization and worker participation using a dataset from a social-auditing firm that includes all audits that the firm conducted from 2012 to 2015. The audited firms in the dataset are located all over the world, especially in China, and they are in the supply chains of a wide range of industries, ranging from old economy staples like furniture and clothing to new industries like electronics. On each audit, the auditor examines the firm’s operations and assigns it a score between 0 and 100 that is meant to capture the firm’s level of compliance with a code of conduct that addresses workplace standards, environmental factors and occupational health and safety practices. The study finds evidence that suppliers that utilized legalization and worker-participation strategies improved more over time than the firms that did not do so. However, as Professor Short and her coauthors note, the goals of improved working conditions and environmental standards are in tension with the economic goal of producing goods as cheaply as possible. This tension was reflected in the data: the use of incentive compensation that might incentivize employees to cheat to meet production goals appeared to reduce the positive impact of legalization and worker participation. The paper therefore offers lessons for the promotion of human rights abroad and for managing global supply chains.Ro!

At times, GIF’s are better than videos to get your message through or engage your friends/followers. GIF(Graphics Interchange Format) is a set of multiple images in one file making it animated. In the past, we shared how you can share GIF on WhatsApp and post GIF on Instagram. And in this tutorial, we will let you know how to upload or post GIF on Facebook, the social media giant.
If you are here reading this then it is safe to assume that you tried to upload GIF on Facebook like you upload a photo/video. Yikes, after hitting that Post button you see that your GIF is not animated and sits there as a normal image. Well, it is because Facebook doesn’t allow or supports uploading GIF directly. But you can use the method mentioned below to share GIF on Facebook.
Post GIF on Facebook
If you have your own GIF on your computer/PC and wish to upload it on Facebook then you cannot directly upload it as you might have found out.
GIF can only be posted via links on Facebook. So, in order to get a link to your GIF, you will have to first upload it somewhere on a server. Now, you don’t need to purchase a server for this task. You can make use of file hosting services like Google Drive or Dropbox.
In this example, I am going to share steps and procedure for Google Drive. But once you know this you can easily follow the same method for other file storing services with slight changes.
1. Upload GIF on Facebook From Computer
a. Open Google Drive and sign in using your Gmail account.
b. Upload your GIF there by using the New File Upload option. Make sure you turn on link sharing for the GIF file. This means anyone with the link can view the file.
c. After the file is uploaded, double-click to open it. Once it opens, click on the three vertical dots at the top right corner and select Open in new Window.
d. Now, in the new Window, right click on the GIF and select Copy image address if you are using Chrome. On Firefox the option will be by the name of Copy Image Location. On other browsers, the same option will have different names but you should be able to make out easily which one gives the URL of the GIF.
Alternatively, you can also right click and select the Open image in new tab and copy the image URL from the address bar.
e. After you have copied the URL of the GIF, head over to Facebook. Go to your profile, page or group you wish to post the GIF. You can either use Ctrl+v on keyboard or right click on the status box and select Paste.
This will paste the GIF URL and it will be loaded in the preview. Once you have the preview you can either keep the GIF URL or remove it. It is up to you.
Finally, hit the Publish/Post button.
Your GIF will be there.

2. Post GIF on Facebook from other Websites
If you want to publish a GIF you like on other websites then simply right click on the GIF and select Copy Image Location(Firefox) or Copy image address(Chrome).
Alternatively, you can also view the GIF and copy its URL from the address bar.
After copying the GIF URL, go to your Facebook profile, page or group where you wish to post the GIF. Paste the GIF address in the status box using Ctrl+v or by right clicking and selecting paste.
Once you get the GIF preview, you can either keep the URL in the status/post or remove it as desired.

Abstract
Guinevere has existed in literature for nearly a millennium, evolving to suit societal values and mores. She has metamorphosed from Arthur’s noble queen to Lancelot’s jealous lover, from a motherly sovereign to a vindictive adulteress as each author struggled to apply his own literary and societal conventions to a character that is both inherited and created.
In addressing the evolution of Guinevere, this thesis has followed her progression through three works: The Knight of the Cart by Chrétien de Troyes, Le Morte d’Arthur by Sir Thomas Malory, and The Idylls of the King by Alfred, Lord Tennyson. In addition, this thesis has drawn upon literary criticism, including that of Maureen Fries and Norris J. Lacy, in proving how Guinevere’s character marks the societal values and beliefs of each author’s time period, as well as how she exemplifies the struggle to understand female characters in literature.

December 18, 2016 6:44 pm
After a hiatus of 4 weeks I am back.
While Grammar Schools continue to divide political parties, such reasons being given by nay-sayers are not even remotely near the mark. Their argument centres mainly on the fact that bright pupils from the community are needed to form the top stratum of Comprehensives/Academies. They claim those very bright children will inspire the slower pupils to achieve. Of course this is nonsense. Our country needs its bright minds and those bright minds, indubitably, develop and flower more vividly at Grammar Schools. These establishments give clever children from poor backgrounds an opportunity to reach the top fruit on life’s tree. Grammars have teachers as committed to excellence and attendance as those found at top Public Schools. Above all, behavioural expectations in these small academic communities are demanding and rigidly enforced. And they are free!
One would think, therefore, along with top achievement both on the playing field and in the classroom, every politician and every parent would demand a possible Grammar School place for every child. But no, there appears a conspiracy among certain people to condemn, with garrulous and intransigent near sightedness all those brilliant children whose parents happen to be poor, to the realms of local High Schools.
At the moment I am feeling particularly riled on behalf of a teenager I tutor. With her sights set on a career either in veterinary surgery, psychological profiling or law, she has had precious little maths, literature or science this term. Why? Her teachers have been absent for some reason, frequently sick or pregnant. This student with her breathtaking ambition and willingness to work and her longing to achieve should have the opportunity of securing a Grammar School place. I fear, however, she will become disheartened and end up another victim of noisy classrooms and absentee teachers. With stunning indifference our decision makers simply refuse to acknowledge the abyss between idealism and reality, between the haves and have nots and that one of the only ways to achieve a fairer system is via Grammar Schools.
Rant over! Back to the next stage of teaching your child to read.
Our next phonics are:
all; as in ball, call, hall and in gallon and balloon.
ell; as in dell, fell, bluebell, shell, swell, spell.
ill; as in spill, chill, trill, filling, willing, pillar.
oll; as in doll, dolly, brolly, swollen, holly.
ull; as in full, bull, pull and in gull, dull, mull.
Where a phonic has two sounds, e.g. ‘ball and gallon,’ or ‘full and gull’ teach exactly that way. Explain this phonic has two sounds, but it’s not a problem, we can tell which sound we need when we read it in a book.
And now your reader can manage;
‘That magic ball in beautiful colours fell softly into the bluebells with a little bang, Great sparks glittered and spilled into the dark friendly woods. I took a doll and a teddy and we made a house under lovely green trees. We had a drink of Cherry Cheer and a shell cake with gillyberry sweets. Dolly said the picnic was magically wonderful and told her friend Molly Rabbit.’
‘Sunshine spilled into the pretty yard when Milly took her brolly and set it up among the bamboo canes in her back garden. Olly came along with his best books and he and Milly began to look at the colourful pages. Olly liked the red jelly and sweets in chapter ten but Milly loved the chilli balls and bully-bells in chapter seven. Suddenly, Mum came up, smiling at the children. ”Let us have lemon drink and folly cakes,” she said. ”They are so tasty.”
”Oh, yes,” cried Milly and Olly. They were all very happy.’
Draw and colour pictures both for comprehension and enjoyment. All of the above text can be read – with attention to phonics and sounding across. Aside from the handful of sight words nothing needs to be guessed at, remembered or worked out via an illustration. Your child is reading!
Keep learning the fast phonics, keep playing, keep reading and your child will be a fearless and confident reader, ready and able to answer every question put to him as he progresses through his education.
Now for a further game which, once again, combines learning with fun.
When my son was tiny I would frequently speak to him in French and Latin, nothing impressive simply pieces dredged up from my own school days. If I sang little songs and lullabies in these languages he would want me to translate each word. One day he asked me to teach him to say ‘hello’ and ‘goodbye’ in every language. Rashly and with only a mother’s bravado I promised to do my best, bearing in mind this was the sixties, no Google, no car and the nearest library in Dee Why, an uphill, downhill walk away. Ultimately, the few languages I gathered were painstakingly researched and fairly few on the ground.
Fifty years have greatly dimmed the precise languages, but, the game went as follows. Each room in the house was a different country and would have a specific item of clothing to hand, plus a few pictures with information. I was the wide-eyed tourist. I would visit room by room, country by country, to be met by a smiling native.
”Bonjour Madame,” said my young tour guide in the laundry, wearing a black beret and with an eyebrow pencil moustache lopsidedly decorating his upper lip. Showing me pictures of Paris, Notre Dame, outdoor cafes, the Champs Elysee, he would describe each picture, giving me a thumbnail sketch of life in Paris and in France. Adding humour to the spiel he would tell me the French love onions so much they carry strings of them around their necks to eat along the way. Then, more factually, add that the French bake special bread and grow lots of grapes to make wine, and lavender to make scent.
Then, bidding me ”Au revoir,” he would invite me to wander round his ‘country’ – at which point he scorched off to the living room, tied on an obi sash and was at the door to wait for his tourist.
”Konnichiwa,”I was greeted with a deep bow and we had a repeat performance of France, but now describing cherry blossoms, paper walls, tea ceremonies, warm winds and so on. Then ”Sayonara,” and the tourist would ‘roam’ Japan while Germany was prepared for me in the kitchen.
This intriguing game was, like the Estate Agent play, designed to develop creative, fast thinking, articulate speech, manners and confidence. Along the way my four year old learned a huge amount of geography, quite a lot of history and began a lifelong love of languages (he won the French Literature Prize at Brentwood School and years later taught himself a working knowledge of both Russian and Greek).
Games will not only teach a child, they will develop and encourage his knowledge in so many ways. You never ever have to sell a game even to the most recalcitrant pupil – it is pure sugar-coated learning.

Once I got going though I was pretty productive, managed to get through 4 hours of organic chemistry lectures (so I'm up to date with that module, until Wednesday anyway!), still have quite a few more hours to go (although thankfully out of double figures now!), not going to do any more tonight mind!
Also managed half an hour or so of some physical/inorganic chemistry work shop questions. Not interesting enough to hold my attention though so I gave up and had some food instead. Based on my now, post-dinner feelings I expect that's it for me today with work, 'cept for helping my brother learn some maths later!
Given that I'm going to be in the lab all day tomorrow I think I can have a relaxing evening. Looks like we really will be in the lab all day as well, as opposed to previous lab rotations where everything has been done early. We've got a tight schedule to follow if we're going to get everything done for our project. I'm not optimistic, even now and not having set foot in the lab, but it is my first "real" chemistry in over a year and depending where life takes me it could be the last time I ever go in a lab so I should try and make the best of it. I'll keep telling myself that. *grumble grumble labs grumble grumble*
Here's today's picture. Work and coffee (lunch!), what an exciting life I lead! :PHello everybody. It's me...JR Boyd. I certainly hope everybody had a safe and happy Father's Day weekend. It's hot here in Texas and I couldn't think of anything better for you than a hot and steamy story. So, I decided to rifle through my archives to kill two birds with one stone. One, I spared myself some time to spend with my daddy and my family. Two, I get the chance to share some of this Texas heat with you. I hope you enjoy it. It's one of my faves. Feel free to let me know what you think *wink*.
And without further ado...here's Digging Deep.
Digging Deep
Shayne laughed as he closed his cell phone. “Apparently, you have made quite the impression on my brother, Dillon.”
“What do you mean, Mr. Standeven?” Dillon’s pace quickened as he tried to keep up with his long-legged senior.
Shayne turned to his intern. “My brother wants to go out with you. And, since we’re in town, I told him you would meet him this evening.”
“But, Mr. Standeven-” Dillon’s eyes widened, his voice two octaves higher than normal.
The archaeologist quickly changed the subject. “This is it. This is the site for our next dig.” Shayne let his satchel strap slide down his arm as he knelt to the ground.
“Mr. Standeven, I simply cannot-”
“This is the kind of dirt we will be working with.” Shayne tapped the hard ground with a rock. “As you can see, it’s going to take most near every tool and piece of equipment-”
“Damn it, Mr. Standeven! I am your intern. Not a callboy. You can’t just pimp me out to your brother like that. I don’t even know your brother.”
Shayne stood, his full height causing him to tower over Dillon. He placed a hand on Dillon’s shoulder and peered down into his eyes. “Dillon, please. I understand it may be awkward. But it’s not any more awkward for you than it is for me. My brother just wants to meet you. That’s all. And, frankly, I have a hard time talking about his sexuality with him. It felt good to be able to do this.”
Dillon dug the heel of his boot into the dry ground. “I can’t believe this.”
“Just meet him in town. That’s all I ask.”
“Alright. But you owe me, Mr. Standeven.” Dillon eyed his boss as the older man's focus shifted again to the dirt under their feet.
****
Dillon gazed into the evening sky as the sun sank behind the buildings. The hustle and bustle of the town square made his head swim. With drifting thoughts, Dillon barely noticed the lights come on as the downtown lamp post cast its glow over him.
“Dillon? Dillon Ezparza?” The voice was as gentle as a breeze rustling through a field of wheat.
The sexy voice drew Dillon from his trance. He blinked once, brought the other man into focus as he extended his hand between them. “Nathan Standeven…” Dillon smiled. “What a delight it is to finally meet you.” Dillon looked him over and what he saw caused his cock to throb against his jeans.
“I do believe the pleasure is mine.” Nathan’s face lit up with joy.
Dillon’s attraction for Nathan took him totally off guard. Ogling the full length of his date’s body, Dillon knew he couldn't hide what he was thinking. Holy shit. He’s hot!
Right there in front of the movie theater, uncaring of who watched, Nathan cupped Dillon’s jaw settling his mouth over Dillon’s. Dillon welcomed Nathan’s tongue as it slid past his parted lips. Coffee. He tastes like coffee and chocolate.
Dillon groaned into his lover’s mouth. “I need you. Right now.”
Dillon led his boss’s brother to his van, clamoring in a twist of arms and legs to the bench seat in the back. He meshed his rigid cock with Nathan’s as moans filled the van.
Nathan grunted, reached for Dillon’s shirt. “Too many clothes.”
Fueled by desire and the scent of hot flesh, Dillon stripped quickly, his cock throbbing with the mix of cool night air and Nathan sans clothing. When Nathan lifted off the seat to shove his pants down his legs, Dillon gripped his hips and flipped Nathan over. He spread Nathan’s ass cheeks and slathered the alluring manhole with his wet tongue.
But only for a minute. Nathan had something else in mind.
“Turn around here and let me taste that fat cock of yours.” Nathan ordered, pulling away to lay on his back across the seat.
A final flick over Nathan’s asshole, and Dillon turned around and straddled his lover’s face. Dillon swiped his hard cock across Nathan’s moist lips as he took great pleasure in gulping down the well-endowed prick that danced before him.
Unable to control himself any longer, Dillon rocked his hips forward. Dillon felt Nathan’s throat tighten around his prick. Sounds of slurping and gagging spurred Dillon’s craving for satisfaction.
Nathan’s ability to deep throat sent Dillon’s eyes rolling back and made him yearn for even more of his date’s cock in his throat.
Gasping for a quick breath of air, Nathan cried out. “Fuck my face, baby. Shove that cock!”
Nathan’s fingers dug into Dillon’s ass cheeks. And at the same time, he also received another few inches of dick in his throat.
With a final thrust of his cock and plunge of his mouth, Dillon ensured both cocks were buried deep. Muffled moans filled the van as lust washed over the backs of their throats.
Dillon swallowed one last time then turned around. He grinned, loving the sparkle in Nathan’s pretty blue eyes. “This show is playing tomorrow night too.”

XOXO,
DeniseMy baby turned 5 this week. Another milestone has passed.
I used to always feel sad at each of their birthdays. Lamenting how they were growing too fast. Longing for their chunky babyness to remain. Another year older marked the perfect time for me to drown myself in old video footage from the years before.
I have always referred to Imogen as “my baby”. Calling her “my best baby” to differentiate her from Jaz, who is “my best big girl”.
So at her birthday dinner when I called her “baby girl”, she said, “I’m 5 now, I’m not a baby anymore.” Historically this would have sent me into a weepy decline. Now I would definitely be dragging out baby videos when we got home?? But I felt just fine. I have wanted to get my head around their inevitable growth .. to feel good about it.
For me, the key to this acceptance is not feeling regretful about my parenting. There is no, “I wish I had done more of this… or less of that…” I am an engaged, happy parent most of the time. And for the many times that I am not, I don’t beat myself up about it.
Now Imi is 5 and starts school next week. And I just feel thankful for her 5 glorious baby years and am ready for the next stage. No tears required.
As I tucked her in after a long day of picnicking, bushwalking and celebrating, I tested… “goodnight baby big girl.” She seemed content with the new title, for now…

AUSTRALIAN TERRIER ORIGINS
The Australian terrier originated in Australia in the 19th century. The earlier settlers wanted a breed that was hardy & robust enough to cope with the tough Australian conditions & that was also capable to help eradicate Vermin & snakes, aswell as a herding dog.They also wanted a small dog as a companion for the children & wives on the homesteads.
The actual origins are uncertain, but is suggested they where developed by crossing several British rough coated type terrier breeds such as the Dandie Dinmont (for protective & decorative topknots) The skye terrier (for ear carriage,litheness,lenght of body, neck ruff & front coat apron) The yorkshire terrier (to retain a coveniently small size & to emphasize pleasant colour ) The Scottish terrier (which was different looking from todays Scottie was used for the harsh weather proof coat) The Cairn terrier (once again was probably used for erect ears & coat quality ) & Irish terriers (perhaps the Manchester terrier, where used for enriching the colour ) .
Development of the breed began in Tasmania in 1820 & it was first known as the "Australian Rough coated Terrier". They where first shown under this name in Melbourne in1868. The breed was first recognised with the founding of the first breed club in 1887 & they finally became known & recognised as "The Australian terrier" in 1892.
They where recognised in the UK in 1933, & The American kennel club in 1960.
AUSTRALIAN TERRIER CHARACTER
The Australian terrier (or the Aussie as they are affectionaly known ) are what you would describe as a big dog in little dogs body. They are energetic little dogs with charming personalities. They are fearless, intelligent, adventurous, tenacious, cheeky, extreamly friendly fun loving little clowns with Personality Plus!!
They are extreamly loyal & love to please, & it's because of this that most Aussies are alot easier to train than some of the other terrier breeds. They make a great family dog & fit into most enviroments,whether its a rural acreage property or an apartment in the city Aussies will easily adapt to the life style.
I find once you own a Aussie, they quickly win over your heart with their enduring qualities,& I must warn you that once they have captured your heart you just might not be able to stop at one!!
AUSTRALIAN TERRIER TEMPERAMENT
Australian terriers are calm & outgoing, extreamly friendly & affectionate & make excellent companions. They are great with children,provided that the child is taught to be respectful & gentle with them.(Adult supervision is always advisable with children & all breeds of dogs .)
Being a working terrier they do have high prey drives & should always be socialised from a young age with smaller pets. We do advise though that you still always supervise your Aussie with smaller animals.
Aussies are not overly yappy, but will bark to announce strangers & visitors & they do make excellent watch dogs.
They can be escape artists, so a securely fenced yard is essential, aswell as some form of entertainment like toys & a chewy bone to stop boredom & prevent digging.

Australian terriers are great with children of all ages
DESCRIPTION OF AN AUSTRALIAN TERRIER
A low set, sturdy, rough-coated lttle dog. Extreamly well adapted for Australia's changing climates & protected by a double coat- a soft coated undercoat with a weather resistant harsher coat, which grows to a length of 6.5 cm (2.5 inchs). In maturity both sexes have a ruff framing the head at the neck which extends to an apron covering the neck. It has a topknot of lighter colour & finer texture to the main body coat. They come in the colours of Blue & tan, Solid red, & Sandy red.
The look of the Aussie terrier is described as "Hard bitten" & "Rugged". They have a long head with erect v-shaped ears & lively oval dark eyes. The black nose has a v-shaped space above it. The teeth should meet in a scissor bite. The body is slightly longer than it is tall, with a level top line. The chest is strong , moderately wide & deep.They have small cat - like feet with a high set tail ( which have been traditionaly docked in the past, but are now no longer docked in Australia.)
"Bailey" A Blue & Tan Australian terrier.
"Tubby" A Sandy/Red Australian terrier.
EXCERCISING YOUR AUSTRALIAN TERRIER
Australian terriers are busy little dogs with lots of energy,& need atleast 30 minutes of some form of excercise a day. Our dogs do well running around our acreage & swimming in the dam,however for owners that are not on acreage, your Aussie should be happy with a 30 minute walk on a lead, or a off leash run in a confined area like a dog park (Never let your Aussie of leash in an unconfined area in public, as due to their high prey drive if something does catch their eye they may run off & may be very hard to recall)
Aussies are also very happy if you give them 30 minutes of play time at home , like a game of fetch & most of them love an outing in the car visiting family & friends. They also do well with dogs sports like Agility & Earth dog trials.
TRAINING & OBEDIENCE
Australian terriers are very busy & determined little dogs, & would certainly take over a house hold if "let go". They do need a firm hand & consistency is required. We recommend all new owners to take their pups to puppy scool & to purchase a good book on training, behaviour & obedience.
Once an Aussie has established you as their "Pack leader", they are a joy to have in the home. They are very clever & quickly pick up new commands & tricks.
GROOMING YOUR AUSTRALIAN TERRIER
The Australian terrier has a low shedding coat & is fairly easy to groom. For pet dogs they require a good brush a couple of times a week to remove dead hairs, & when needed the hair around the eyes,ears, bottom & paws should be neatened & trimmed. Nails also should also be regularly clipped. They only require a bath about once a month or when they a very dirty. Over bathing them can strip the coat of its oils.
For show dogs, their is a little more grooming involved & the coat requires hand stripping.
GENERAL HEALTH & LIFE SPAN
Aussie terriers are a very tough, hardy, healthy Robust breed, that are blessed with very little health problems & hereditary diseases. They are prone to diabetes if they become obese & a well balanced diet of a good premium food for small dogs combined with decent excercise is recommended. (do not over do the treats )
It has been known for some dogs to suffer from luxating patellas in the past, but breeders have done well to breed this out & it is very rare to see a case these days.
The Aussie terriers life span is approximately 12 to 15 years, but some Aussies we have known have lived way into their late teens.

[[WMG:Heroes are repurposed civilians]]
* Heroes aren't built completely from scratch. Most villains canonically started out as something different, so it's possibly that Heroes are civilian workers that, either voluntarily or otherwise, have been reworked into a body more suitable for crimefighting and world-saving and whatnot. Sure, there are mentions of Heroes being built "from scratch", but it's implied that the Assembly Tower is how Mak Megahertz "recovered" from being de-atomized.
[[WMG: Rocka is really a female pretending to be a guy]]
There were no females in the 3.0 wave. Maybe she wants to avoid attention from Furno.
* Or the glass ceiling.
* This is now [[{{Tropers/MorttheGhost}} my]] new headcanon.
[[WMG: My predictions for 5.0]]
* Von Nebula will be back, and with a new set.
* The heroes will have a different build entirely from the 2.0-4.0 ones, and bring back gear functions.
* William Furno will be rebuilt into a draconic form, and Rocka into a literal lion.
* There will be a new female.
* More vehicles.
** Assuming you're talking about the Brain Attack series, most of these things are jossed. Exceptions include part of your second point and your fifth point, because gear functions are present in the Jet Rocka set, which can also be considered a vehicle. Action features are also present in several of the other sets this wave, though none of the sets but Jet Rocka use gears for this purpose, and all of the sets with action features are still largely based on the traditional 2.0 build.
[[WMG: There will be an official cross-over with Bionicle in the near-future]]
* The reason all these "Bring Bionicle Back" campains and petitions are failing is actually because Lego is secretly planning to actually re-release Bionicle-themed sets as part of a secret cross-over with Hero Factory. Lego is fully aware of the large fandom of Bionicle; and the reason they "discontinued" Bionicle was to move the sights over to a terraformed astroid not far from Spherus Magna so they can "expand" the story. This is especially notable in the 4.0 series, where we are introduced to Black Phantom. The reason we don't get a backstory is because it's shocking: [[spoiler:Black Phantom is actually Makuta Teridax, who somehow survived the destruction of the Great Spirit Robot and was captured by Hero Factory.]] He even gets into the depths of the factory at the end of the 4.0 arc, and following that, [[spoiler:the Toa team up with the Heroes to defeat Teridax once more.]] The reason Lego did not tell anyone is simple. It's a suprise.
** {{Jossed}}. Greg Farshtey, writer of the BIONICLE and Hero Factory books and comics, stated [[ here]] that there will never be a BIONICLE and Hero Factory crossover because they do not exist in the same time continuum, just as the real world and the BIONICLE universe would never interact in canon story media.Your Secure Session, is about to expire in seconds..Useful links

However, it is important to note that an Employee also has a duty to engage in the interactive process. Failure for an Employee to engage in the interactive process may result in his/her case being dismissed.
Before an individual can ask for an accommodation, he/she must prove they are disabled under the ADA. Once an individual establishes he/she is disabled under the ADA, he/she can engage in the interactive process with the Employer to request an accommodation.)). In other words, once the Employer is put on notice that an individual is disabled and requires an accommodation, the Employer has a duty to participate in the interactive process of trying to accommodate the individual and his/her disability.
While the Employer has a duty to engage in the interactive process, so does the Employee. If the Employer is engaging in the interactive process and the Employee is not cooperating, then the Employee is not acting in good faith and may not be able to bring a disability discrimination lawsuit against their Employer if an accommodation is not provided. In Taylor v. Phoenixville School, 184 F.3d 296, 312 (3d. Cir. 1999), there was an Employee diagnosed with a mental disorder who sought to return to work from extended disability leave. The Employer required the Employee to take a physical before returning to work. Id. The Employee refused to take the physical and refused to return to work. Id. The Court held that:
An employee’s request for reasonable accommodation requires a great deal of communication between the employee and employer … [B]oth parties bear responsibility for determining what accommodation is necessary … “[N]either party should be able to cause a breakdown in the process for the purpose of either avoiding or inflicting liability. Rather, courts should look for signs of failure to participate in good faith or failure by one of the parties. In other words, because the Employee did not get the physical exam or return to work, the Court found that he was not acting in good faith in trying to accommodate his disability. Therefore, the Employer’s refusal to accommodate the Employee was not discriminatory.
For a simpler example, let’s say an Employee has a disability and an Employer offers an accommodation in the form of a light-duty position. If the Employee simply refuses the job, fails to give an explanation as to why the accommodation is not reasonable and stops showing up to work, he/she is not acting in good faith and has failed to engage in the interactive process. If the Employer subsequently terminates the Employee, the Employee will have a difficult time proving disability discrimination.
It is important to remember that engaging in the interactive process is not one-sided. It is not the Employer’s sole responsibility to offer accommodations. It is also the Employee’s responsibility to actively engage in the process of trying to find an appropriate accommodation for his/her disability.Good news on the job front - I got a phone interview! Relief - I was starting to get all despair-y. I said the other day that I have mood swings, not emotions lately, and that's largely because of the uncertainty. Life is wide open right now; no particular location to move to, no reason to stay or leave, no particular job that I want, no clothes I want. I didn't even really want the smartphone; I was fine with my old phone. So that's the trouble - I don't have a thing to want. I mean, I want to stay fit, so I'm running. I want to lose 5lbs, but I'm working out and eating well so there's nothing more I can do there. Things are best to want, because they are achievable, like degrees for instance. Maybe I was so upset about Bud because he distracted me from this realization. There's nothing I can do about it. I can't tell myself how to feel.
Things I used to want:
to run a fashion blog
to have a boyfriend
the perfect white t-shirt
the perfect chambray shirt
to publish a best-selling novel
Okay, I still want the perfect white t-shirt, but the other things I don't want anymore. I want a relationship, not a boyfriend. I figured out which clothes look good on me, so I'm not obsessed with fashion. I found my chambray shirt last March. I don't care if my novel is best-selling (or even published), just that I wrote it; and it doesn't even have to be a novel anymore.
I was asked, would I rather, for the rest of my life, have every song I hear be by Nickelback, or have the lead actor in every movie be replaced by Nicolas Cage?
I chose Nicolas Cage. For me music > movies. What an evil choice to make. I hope it never comes to this.At the same time, I want to be healthy and fit. I want to radiate. I want to be at peace with my body instead of always fighting with it.
I think I'll be okay. Just got to keep trekking along and focus on the picture in my mind of the healthy, happy, radiant me :)
Rissa and her long time boyfriend broke up this past week so she really wanted to have a girls getaway weekend. We got a room at this cute boutique hotel downtown :) We went to dinner at this place called The Catacombs. Finding something on the menu that was vegan was practically impossible. Everything had either meat, cheese, or both. I ended up getting this cucumber tomato salad with kalamata olives, hold the feta, with some bread on the side for a bit more sustenance. I also ended up eating the crusts from Rissa's pizzas which felt a tad glutenous but maybe that's just the eating disorder talking.
We're such old ladies at heart, we turned in for the night after dinner. Ended up watching The Wedding Planner and Monster-In-Law on the teli and drank wine. Rissa had this idea we were going to drink two entire bottles of wine between the two of us in addition to the drink (plural for Rissa) we had with dinner. She was so funny nagging me to finish my wine so she could give me more. I'm not a crazy drinker and I barely drink a glass at a time. I'm not someone who likes drinking a lot- one glass is just find with me and I'll sip on it for the entire night. I don't get why it bothers the friends I hang out with that I only drink one glass, in comparison to their two or three or more glasses of alcohol.
Rissa is already asleep! I think it was the wine. She was hiccuping and everything haha. Reminds me of the disney movie Sleeping Beauty, when the mandolin player kept sneaking drinks while the two kings fought and ended up drunk, hiccuping and asleep under the table.
I'm just chilling in the lobby of the hotel on my computer, thinking. Thinking about the future, thinking about whether or not I am going to choose health over Ed. The more I think about it, the more I want health. I'm slightly jealous of my friends who are giving into their eds...but I know it's not worth it. The price is too high and I'm not willing to pay with my life.
Drunk girls are walking through the lobby in their sequined, too tight, too short dresses and mini skirts. I'm glad I'm staying here and not going out like them.
It's so definitely NOT worth it <3
One day, when your life is back on track and you're getting everything you SHOULD be getting/experiencing, you'll be glad you found the strength to abandon your EDs for your health, the courage to choose life over death.
I'll pray for your friends, too.
I think the up and down feelings are normal. I experience those too. I think the tricky part of ED is....when we are experiencing a good part of recovery, it tricks us back to it, it throws us wrenches, makes it harder. That is when we need to use our healthy coping skills and recovery tools. Use the reminders you mentioned about wanting "to be healthy, fit, to radiate". Keep reminding yourself of this, focus on these. They are not compatable with an ED. You can do this. Stay strong. You are doing wonderful and have made so much progress. Proud of you. We can do this!
"The price is too high and I'm not willing to pay with my life."
PREACH.
I think during those time you just really have to evaluate which is more important, losing weight and feeling small or "I want to be healthy and fit. I want to radiate. I want to be at peace with my body instead of always fighting with it."
I know it gets really frustrating wanting two things, but not being able to have both. Some of my friends are struggling a lot like yours. When I feel like I really want what they have, I force myself to think about eveything else that I DO NOT want that will come with it. I think about everything I have to sacrifice just to be thin. Its not worth it, you're right. Its hard, and I wish there was some way to get over it, but for now we just have to keep telling ourselves what we truely want in like and how we are going to get there. You can do it, keep your head up! <3Buy new best Chenille It from $11.17

The smartphone had 1.4 million registrations for its flash sale and on the date of the sale it sold out in under 1 minute. Fans around the world have been asking the company when they will be announcing Nokia 6 for other countries. Good news for Nokia fans, Nokia 6 is heading to different markets with its first stop being Philippines.
One of the major retailers in the country, Lazada Philippines will be selling the Nokia 6 exclusively. The seem to have the white variant of the device in-stock. In Chinese market we only got to see the black variant. In the promotional advertisement another stark difference can be seen in the prices. In China, Nokia 6 retailed at $245 but at Lazada Philippines, it is priced at $370. It will go on sale on 26th February.
Nokia under HMD Global is working on reviving the iconic brand name. For this purpose their strategy is to produce devices with good specs and an affordable price point. In China this strategy has worked but we don’t know how many devices were sold. In Philippines with a higher price point will users choose Nokia 6 or go for some other brand which offers same specs at a better price points.

Royal Westmoreland - 13 February 2017
There’s loads to see and do during the day in Barbados, whether it be the gorgeous beaches or perhaps a tour of a rum distillery, but things are just as exciting when the sun goes down, with a rich and varied nightlife to explore.
The majority of the activity takes place at St. Lawrence Gap on the island’s south coast (or ‘The Gap’, as it’s also known), but there’s also a concentration of high-end bars located on the west coast (the ‘Platinum Coast’).
So whether it’s a chilled out cocktail bar or a lively street party you’re after, here are twelve of the best bars in Barbados.
Payne’s Bay
St. James
This swanky cocktail bar/restaurant is located right on the west coast of the island, overlooking the gorgeous Payne’s Bay.
The bar itself is found inside an old chattel house (a small, moveable wooden house), with classy décor featuring pop art prints of celebrities such as Marilyn Monroe and Steve McQueen.
The drinks menu features a long list of cocktails, and there’s a great selection of Asian and local dishes to snack on too.
Marine Villa
Bay Street
St. Michael
This large open-air club is found right on the beach, just to the south of Bridgetown. They hold a number of events, such as the Beach Extravaganza Dinner Show every Monday and Wednesday, with live music, fire-eating, acrobats, limbo dancing and plenty of audience participation!
On other nights it’s your standard club night, and the place to be after the Oistin’s Fish Fry on a Friday night!
St. Lawrence Gap
Christ Church
This margarita bar is located in the heart of the St. Lawrence Gap hotspot and is lively without being too rowdy.
Earlier on, they also serve a great selection of Mexican food and offer happy hour deals on drinks between 5-7pm and 10pm-12pm.
And if you’re not into margaritas, don’t worry, as they also have loads of other cocktails, with different drinks offers every night.
Hastings
This open air venue serves up great fresh food, including locally caught fish, and a huge array of 68 house cocktails!
The
piña
coladas in particular come highly recommended, and their location right on Rockley Beach makes it the perfect place to chill out for a quiet drink.
Rockley
No matter how much you’re having a great time in Barbados, you don’t want to miss the big game while you’re away, so be sure to check out Bert’s.
It’s owned by the owner of a Canadian hockey team, and while their games take priority, they show all the major sporting events and also serve up a mean banana daiquiri.
And if you’re hungry try out one of their authentic stone-fire pizzas.
Limegrove
Holetown
If there’s
one
word to sum up the Lime Bar on the west coast, it would be ‘style’. Their team of spirit connoisseurs take the time craft you the perfectly balanced cocktail whether it be a mojito, martini, or one of their own creations.
They also have a number of live music nights which are always worth checking out.
Mango Bay Hotel
This sophisticated cocktail bar in Holetown offers regular live DJ sets, a slight hipster vibe, and great drinks of course.
Their signature cocktails include the Red Door Mule, which consists of white rum, fresh lime, wild berries and ginger, topped with ginger beer.
2nd Street
Attached to the excellent restaurant of the same name, The Mews have a great selection of drinks on offer, as well as their own house band, Saphire, who play a mixture of jazz, hip-hop, reggae and soca every Wednesday and Friday.
1st Street

Publisher: Dark Horse
Writer: John Layman
Artist: Chris Mooneyham
Colorist: Michael Atiyeh
Cover: Glenn Fabry
When you mix three iconic characters like these you better come with a story worthy of the carnage and destruction we expect to see. The Predators have a history of being the most adept hunters in the galaxy, Aliens are the perfect killing machines, and Judge Dredd IS The Law which makes his jurisdiction the entire planet I guess. So let’s find out if this triple threat match is worthy of your time and money!
Layman opens the story with a tense chase scene where we catch up to a Predator in a position that we usually don’t get to see them in. It’s a fast paced introduction that not only introduces him but some of the genetically created villains in the story as well. They have a link to a more sinister villain that is introduced later who gives off a Dr. Moreau vibe but it’s this person that is going to make a bad situation even worse. It’s just what mad scientists do but Layman gives his character Alien DNA to play with so things should get awesomely catastrophic pretty quickly. Now Dredd’s introduction has him and several other Judges dispensing some justice and gets directly to the point of what Dredd is about. Layman also lets you know what type of world we’re operating in and how crazy it’s become especially when one of the villains is named Archbishop Emoji just in case the mutated citizens and talking animal people were a bit too “normal” for you. Now some might be a little disappointed that the Aliens aren’t as prominent here but Layman still makes them a vital piece of the story and a wildcard that effectively connects every one involved and gives us a reason for this story.
As far as the art is concerned, Mooneyham and Atiyeh do some excellent work enhancing the story. That opening sequence is so good because Mooneyham gives you little visual cues that the fight isn’t going in the Predator’s favor aside from the obvious taking place in the panels. Then there’s the reveal shot of the Predator where we see the extent of the injuries and it’s just a nice beat. The rest of the issue is just as good and the opening Judge Dredd panel layouts seem to be a bit of a respective nod to those classic issues from back in the day. Atiyeh’s colors are consistently on point when it comes to heightening the tone and making sure that every panel is just as good as the last.
One thing many look forward to whenever Aliens and Predators show up are the character designs. More so with the Predators because each warrior usually wears a combination of armor that sets him apart from others. Well Mooneyham does not disappoint with the designs here as we get what could be called the “standard” Predator design similar to what we saw in the 1987 film. Then out of nowhere he hits you with some more diverse designs that are the visual kick needed to keep these characters feeling like new. There’s a Predator wearing the chest of a xenomorph as a protective breastplate then there’s another whose mask has a Cylon-like visor! Every piece of armor and weapon is something necessary to the hunt and not just added for an aesthetic choice but to either protect his life or end another. So bravo to Mooneyham for keeping things visually cool and interesting with the Predators. Now I can’t wait to see how he tweaks the designs of the Aliens.
Overall, this is a great first issue that does exactly what it’s supposed to and that’s have you ready to go out and get the second issue when you see that last page. And it’s a safe bet that if you’re already a fan of even one of these characters then you’ll be excited with what the creative team has done here.

I’ve said many times I could write a book on weight loss/fitness/good eating strategies. But really… most of us could right? I mean, not at the age of 18. Maybe not even at 29. But, seeing as I just turned 30 last week I’m feeling very wisdom-y and thought I could do no better deed today than share all those tidbits I’ve gleaned over the years with you all. That or I could clean up our front yard so our neighbors aren’t annoyed with us, the yardworkaphobes, anymore. But I digress.
The thing about all the weight loss/fitness books on the market is that not one of them is going to work for everyone. Because everyone is different. Not just how our bodies metabolize food but how our brains work, how we think, what we are motivated by.
So…recognizing that this little bulleted list might apply to no one in particular besides myself, here goes nothin’.
On exercise…
- Everyone has time to exercise. Not everyone considers it a priority. If you want your health to improve and lose excess weight it’s not about finding time, it’s about making time. Ideally about an hour a day at least three to four days a week. Five to six if you’re trying to get in shape.
- Start slowly. Work your way up to longer, more frequent workouts. You’re not going to go from couch potato to fitness star in a week.
- People who exercise in the morning are, on average, the most regular exercisers. Why? I think this one’s obvious. By the time you get out of work you’re more often than not either tired, cranky, or have a million other things to do. It’s easy to blow off your workout if you put it at the end of your day.
- When you love your workout, it makes being committed to a fitness plan so much easier to stick to. I’m a big fan of group exercise classes for a lot of reasons. Being around other people makes you more aware of how intensely you’re working and makes it less likely you’re going to slack off in the middle when you start to fatigue. It can also be a lot of fun if the environment is right. (Insert plug for jazzercise here)
- Have an exercise buddy. Because exercise is more fun when you have a friend to sweat it out with.
- On the topic of finding something you love – if what you love about your fitness activity of choice is that it’s not that hard (I’m going to use the example of going for a walk, the classic “it’s better than nothing” exercise in my book), find another workout. You get out what you put in.
- Don’t be an “all or nothing” person. This strategy generally doesn’t jive with real life. This mindset also sets you up for failure and possible injury if you have unrealistically high expectations starting out. Set realistic expectations and stick with it.
On eating…
- Getting overeating/bad eating habits under control is not so much about doing something different as it is about being someone different. If you change your habits you will probably see good results. But unless you have also changed the way you think about food, habits can easily revert.
- You have to emotionally distance yourself from food. This is probably the hardest thing to do but the most important. If your sanity rests on whether or not you get to have a brownie after dinner that should send up a red flag.
- On that note – don’t use food as a reward. Find something else you love to reward yourself/console yourself with.
- Try not to get overwhelmed with advice. (Irony, check.) We’ve all heard those “easy little tips” to help you lose weight, right? (Put your fork down in between bites. Drink a glass of water before your meals. Use a smaller plate to trick your brain into thinking you’re eating more. Etc.) They’re great, most of them. But just pick, like, one to focus on, okay? Once that’s second nature to you, maybe try another one.
- DO track your calories. It’s a real eye opener. Even if you eat very healthy foods you can still be eating too much. Possibly WAY too much as I found out after gaining 60 lbs during my last pregnancy. Tracking forces you to be aware of all the little bites here and there and how they add up. There are many free websites and apps that you can use to do this.
- Tracking calories also helps you see trends in your consumption so that you can plan ahead for parties and going out. Being healthy and trim does NOT mean you can’t enjoy life and the food that goes with it! If you know one thing about me it’s that I love food and recognize it as one of the primary ways that we celebrate life. I would never recommend someone forgo all that joy. Just be cognizant of what you’re putting in your body and plan on how you’re going to balance it all out.
- Plan what and how much you’re going to eat before the food is in front of your face. And then stick to it. That’s a lot better than getting to the end of the meal and going, “Whoa. I ate five pieces of pizza?”
- Say it out loud. Or post it on your facebook. Whatever. Make your intentions real and you will be less likely to try and rationalize your way out of doing what you had planned for yourself later. (Does five pieces of pizza sound like a reasonable amount to you?)
- Variety is the spice of life – unless you’re trying to curb how much you eat. The more choices you have, the more you are likely to consume. I’ve read of studies that confirm this and I can tell you from personal experience this is true for me. Every meal can’t be a buffet. Have a main and a veggie or fruit, a small dessert, and call it quits.
- Don’t eat foods you hate just because someone tells you they should be part of your diet plan. That doesn’t work. If your body and your life are going to change you have to be truly satisfied with your meals or you’ll set yourself up for mental/emotional torment.
- Eat until you are 80% full. So Confucius say. Good one to live by.
- Moms – don’t eat off your kids’ plates after you’re done with your meal. Easy way to rack up several hundred extra calories mindlessly. And for what? So you don’t have to put it in the fridge? Surely there are more satisfying ways to consume calories.
- Also moms – when you go to a restaurant you’re not fooling anyone by ordering a salad. You know you’re just waiting to pick fries and the ends of grilled cheese sandwiches off the kids’ plates. Do yourself a favor and order something you actually want – something so yummy it makes the kids’ food look undesirable – and box up half immediately for tomorrow.
- Have dessert. Just keep it small. My rule is 150 calories for an “everyday” dessert. Feeling like you’re depriving yourself is a one-way ticket to emotional overeating.
- And lastly – don’t weigh yourself. At least not often. I think once a week is overkill. The number does not mean ANYTHING. And it has the power to wreck your day if you let it. What matters is how you look, how you feel, how your clothes fit. Those are the things that matter and you don’t need a bathroom scale to tell you those things. We all know how to manipulate the bathroom scale. Why bother? It’s nonsense. Even BMI is a terrible way of determining your fitness level and overall health. It only takes into account weight and height with no regard for muscle mass. You can be the same height and weight (and therefore have the same BMI) as the gal next to you but look completely different because of muscle mass. (I’m not making this up, this exact situation happened to me once.)
That’s it. Thanks for indulging me! See you in a few days with more food!

First of all, happy belated birthday! And second, I agree with you entirely on this post. I just began the process of getting back in shape. And being such foodies, I think I speak for both of us when I say all I can depend on is my willpower in portion control. Three things I swear by: Your Shape game on the Kinect (just bought the kinect for $40 off Craigslist…YAY), the Lose It app for calorie counting on my iPhone, and diet tonic because my vodka needs a low calorie friend.

According to People Magazine, Reynolds opened up about becoming a dad and he is simply smitten with his little girl!
“Having a daughter was a dream come true for me. I would have made a terrible king,” the Deadpool star said. “I never admitted it out loud, to myself or my wife, but I really wanted a little girl,it’s the best,” he added.
Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively have chosen to shelter James from the world — the public has yet to see this baby’s face — and they are very hands-on parents. According to Ryan’s interview, the couple shuffles their respective work schedules around to ensure that one of them is with James at all times.
It’s no surprise, of course, that Ryan is so in love with his daughter.
“I don’t have to prepare to be wrapped around my daughter’s finger. I have been wrapped around her little finger since the day she plopped out into this world,” Reynolds said.
According to E! News, Ryan Reynolds, like many dads, would do anything for his baby girl. And while he and Blake may not be too forthcoming when it comes to chatting about their 1-year-old, Ryan seems more than fine gushing about the wonderful experience that he has had as a father so far.
“I love it. I truly worship that kid. It’s terrible. She has me so far wrapped around her finger it’s dumb. She says ‘dada’ and I will walk through a cement wall to get to her,” he said. Is that not the sweetest thing ever?!.

Disciplinary procedures
The University of Exeter is a community, and as members of this community students are expected to adhere to University rules and regulations, to show respect for persons and property, and to behave in a way that does not interfere with normal operations of the University. Where there is reason to believe that rules and regulations have been broken, and/or when the behaviour of a student falls below the expected standards, Disciplinary Procedures will be instigated by authorised staff.
In general terms, disciplinary offences are likely to fall into one of the categories below:
- Actions which cause actual or potential distress or harm to others;
- Actions which cause actual or potential damage to property of others;
- Actions which may cause reputational damage to the University, particularly instances where this may prevent or disrupt the normal functioning of the University;
- Actions which impede or interfere with the pursuance of work/ study of University members, or impact on normal operations of the University.
A member of staff who has reason to believe that a student is not behaving responsibly will first discuss the matter with the student concerned. If this does not produce a satisfactory solution then the student's personal tutor will be approached, then the Head of Department (or delegated person) who may instigate procedures, or refer the student to the Dean of Taught Faculty.
In all but the most severe cases of unsatisfactory behaviour, you will be warned, in accordance with University procedures and given chances to improve your behaviour. You will normally receive an informal warning, then a College level written warning. If you fail to resolve the issues as set out in that warning, the College will report the student to the Dean of Taught Faculty and recommend appropriate action. Ultimately, failure to respond to measures put in place may lead to you being withdrawn from the University.

UTS van Egeraat Verhuizigen is an age-old relocation company founded in Bergen op Zoom in 1783! In the following years UTS Van Egeraat Verhuizingen developed into a professional relocation company with multiple services, in which quality is of main importance.
With establishments in Bergen op Zoom, Roosendaal and Etten-Leur, UTS Van Egeraat Verhuizingen is the relocation specialist of West-Brabant.
Historie
UTS Van Egeraat Verhuiziningen is a company with an elaborate historical background. Extensive investigation into the archives of the local authorities of Bergen op Zoom prove that the foundation of the relocation company originates from December 1783! The enterprise Van Egeraat Verhuizingen has grown to be an energetic relocation company with a broad service package. UTS Van Egeraat Verhuizingen was added to the Meeus Group as a new operating company around the middle of 2006. The Meeus Group is a big logistic service providing organization with diverse operating companies which are active in their own specialty within the logistics. Our relocation company has establishments in Bergen op Zoom, Roosendaal and Etten-Leur. A lot of our customers are from these locations, but an international relocation is obviously also not a problem. Besides the private and project relocations we are specialized in relocations in the care sector & education and we have the disposal of a modern furniture and archive storage accommodation.
Team
To guarantee this we are continuously occupied with the education and development of our employees. UTS Van Egeraat Verhuizingen has 14 employees with different specialties: 8 of them have a furniture mover/project mover certificate at their disposal, there are 5 move assistants, 2 handy men, 2 front men, 2 project leaders, 2 specialized art movers and 2 company first responders. UTS van Egeraat Verhuizingen combines the advantages of a medium sized relocation company with those of a big national organization – UTS Nederland. In this way we can always fall back on the extra capacity and/or specific knowledge if necessary. Quality, flexibility and the unburdening of our customers are our main assumptions.So a new controversy has popped up. The IDF released a video on June 4th of one of its naval members giving instructions to the Gaza flotilla, at which point a voice comes on the line saying "Go back to Auschwitz" . 2 other comments follow, one voice that has been identified, then another bizarre comment "We are helping Arabs going against the US. Don't forget 9-11 guys" . But the re-released clip comes from a May 31st clip in which the substance and tone are very very different.
So the controversy has erupted whether Israel doctored the tapes. You decide. Both clips are here.Have you seen the Lego movie? We LOVE it! It was rainy and dreary this weekend so I let the boys watch it. They mention Taco Tuesday a bunch of times and Colwynn suddenly says, "What's a taco?" I realized I have never actually made tacos for dinner since he was born. I used to make them once a week when it was just Matt and I. What could be easier? Brown a little meat, stir in the package of mystery powder full of chemicals, and serve on a deep fried and probably partially made of plastic taco shell. Needless to say, that's probably why I haven't made them ;) But tonight I threw a homemade version together complete with shells and a hidden veggie. The kids loved them! The quiet dinner of everyone eating happily was totally worth the AMAZING mess produced by a 7, 5, and 2 year old eating tacos :)
Since there is pureed spinach in with the meat the tacos are green. My family is used to a lot of their food being green so they didn't bat an eye but you could certainly omit the spinach if you don't want green tacos. My kids have no problem eating spinach raw, mixed in stuff, or in a salad but, the second I try to put it on a sandwich or in a tortilla or something, everyone complains. Even the biggest kid (remember when Matt actually requested I puree the spinach into the sloppy joes). So by pureeing it and adding it into the meat I can make sure that they are still eating a green veggie but I save myself all the whining. Then I eat mine with a big pile of spinach and feel extra good about my veggie intake for the day :)
Ingredients:
Taco filling-
- 1 lb 93% lean ground turkey
- 1 Tbsp dried minced onion
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tsp chili powder
- 1 tsp cumin
- 1/2 tsp garlic powder
- 1/4 tsp dried oregano
- 1 T whole grain cornmeal (or whole wheat flour)
- 1/2 cup water
- 3 big handfuls spinach
- Optional: 15oz can no salt added diced tomatoes, undrained
- Optional: 15oz can black beans, drained and rinsed well
Taco shells-
- Whole grain tortillas
- cooking spray
ONE: In a large skillet over medium heat, brown the ground turkey until no longer pink. Drain the excess grease.
TWO: Puree the spinach into the 1/2 cup of water and add it to the browned meat in the skillet with all of the seasonings and tomatoes and black beans if using. (Sometimes I don't feel like bothering with the mini blender so I just rip the spinach up into little pieces and throw it in as is. But still add the 1/2 cup of water). Mix well and continue to cook over medium heat until the sauce has thickened a bit, about 3-5 minutes.
Freeze leftovers in 1/4 cup portions using the medium/large portions method to feed your freezer stash.
To make homemade taco shells:
Turn a muffin pan upside down. Spray both sides of the tortillas lightly with cooking spray and wedge between the cups of the muffin pan so that they are standing upright and look like taco shells. Bake in a preheated 350 degree oven for 15-17 minutes until crispy and golden brown.

:)Iam getting an authentication failure trap from several of my devices.
I know that this kind of trap is generated for an non authorized snmp query to a device.
This general trap does not include the IP address of the equipment who is trying to walk the device.
I think that is a problem of the MIB loaded in the CiscoWorks LMS.
I there a way to include the CiscoGeneralMib ?
This is a limitation in the way DFM handles this trap. If you need to see the IP of the poller, you will have to forward this trap to another trap receiving application, or look at the raw trap in a sniffer trace.
I have the following thoughts...
1.-The DFM development belongs to Cisco.
2.-The latest DFM loads an old MIB for Cisco devices.
3.-The load of the new Cisco MIB in the new realease of CiscoWorks LMS2.6 should fix this problem?
If this simple functionality cant be solved inside Cisco products itself... this is no good at all for the Cisco image. Anyway... i have posted a couple of questions before, and the answer never drives me to a solution without having to spend more money.
The part of DFM responsible for receiving traps and turning them into events belongs to EMC/Smarts, but DFM as a product is Cisco's responsibility. There is no way to load MIBs into DFM, and one will not see the polling address in LMS 2.6 either.
You should open a TAC service request so that a bug can be raised for this.Last February, two months before I embarked on my journey, Ulsterman asked me what was the one thing that I would like to do when I get here (besides him).
Without hesitation I said, "Sean-nós!"
A bewildered Ulsterman replied, "Sean knows what? And who is Sean?".
"No!", I replied, "Sean-nós is an old song genre unaccompanied by instruments. It is the oldest form of traditional Irish music. Very rarely performed and an often misunderstood genre. Mostly performed in the West of Ireland, but can be found in villages in the countryside throughout the island, north and south."
Ulsterman relieved let out a resounding, "I see. Sean-nós it is then."
I was first introduced to traditional Irish music when I was studying Ethnomusicology at UCLA. We were given an elective to take at least one class on the music of Western Europe. I was stuck with the Traditional Irish Music class. I wasn't looking forward to it and thought it would be a snoozer. How exciting can fiddles and tin whistles be? That was until my professor brought his grandfather in who came all the way from Galway!
I remember a very tall distinguished looking gentleman wearing a tweed jacket walking across the lecture stage. He sat himself on the stool, took a deep breath, closed his eyes, and sang like I've never heard anyone before. It pierced right through me, and the cadences of his voice were echoing throughout the hall. It was so beautiful and I was so moved, I couldn't hold back my tears. It was amazing. Just him and his voice. There was a deep soulful genuine-ness to it. Pure and clean. No nonsense bullshit. When he finished his song, there was a 5 second silence which seemed to last forever. Everyone finally picked their chins off the floor and we gave him a well deserved standing ovation. That was the moment I said to myself, "That's it. I'm going to Ireland!"
Fast forward 9 years, I'm here in Norn Iron a year out and no Sean-nós. We travelled to Galway last May with intentions to see it, but we were trapped in the middle of nowhere in Fanore! The trip turned out to be a disaster and I resigned myself to the fact that it wasn't meant to be. I was gutted. I doubt I would be able to hear Sean-nos here in Belfast, I'd probably have to go to the countryside and even then it's not a guarantee that I will see it. Like I said, it's a rare sight because they only do it when it moves them. I'd be lucky to catch one.
***Ethnomusicology = the study of culture through music. Just in case you were wondering. :)
2 comments:
God I wouldn't even know if you could hear it anywhere in Belfast. Have you tried asking at the Ireland Tourist Board, they might know if there are any organisations up here or if anyone will be performing. I know some of the GAA clubs used to have singers and vocalists in to sing on certain nights, a lot of the time unaccompanied but I'm not sure if any sing Sean nos.

Sing Sing’s mothership studio on Gordon St, Melbourne, was a luxurious place decked with outboard gear, loads of instruments, a Neve console in one control room, and an SSL in another. With developers moving in on the storied spot, Sing Sing announced the studio’s secondary Chapel St location (Sing Sing South) would take its place as the studio’s spiritual home. A few hurdles accompanied the prospect of relocating the iconic recording hotspot. Moving a studio with this much gear is an elaborate process at the best of times, notwithstanding the fact that Sing Sing South offers significantly less room to put it all in.
Sing Sing South isn’t a new space. The venue has etched its mark in Aussie recording history ever since the ’50s where it started out hosting radio plays. It fell under the Platinum Recording Studios name a few decades later to produce artists like Daryl Braithwaite, Kylie Minogue, and Crowded House. When Sing Sing owner Kaj Dahlstrom purchased it in 1996, it initially acted as an overflow studio.
“When we were full at Sing Sing in Gordon St we used to move work up there,” says Kaj. “Some people loved it so they just booked that place. We began moving out of Gordon St in January this year, so we started to do up Sing Sing South. We repainted everything and took all the great gear up. It opened on the 1st of June.”
MOVING CONSOLES
So you’ve got to move an 88-channel SSL G-Series console from one studio to another. Where do you start? Thankfully, long-time Sing Sing engineer Adam Rhodes (pictured) is a genius and a half with pulling things apart. Adam successfully dismantled the console into three parts for transportation. Arriving at its new home on Chapel St, the SSL parts were carried upstairs to the control room designed mainly for mixing and mastering. Here, Adam pieced it back together as a 64-channel version of its original self. Quite a feat in itself, and probably not something you’d want to do everyday.
Recording at Sing Sing South is a bit more intimate than its former location. The SSL tracking room isn’t huge but still houses a Yamaha G3 grand piano and six 16-channel headphone mixers for live recording. While the SSL studio is perfectly capable of recording bands (and often does), it’s more tailored for mixing, mastering, and overdubs.
The Neve tracking space is larger and has three isolation spaces branching off it to accomodate vocalists, musicians, or other softer sources when recording live. Don’t sweat it if you forgot to bring your guitar because you’ll be spoilt for choice with the house options. Not just guitars, the Neve live room has a Yamaha C7 grand piano, vintage Wurlitzer and Fender Rhodes electric pianos, and several bass and electric guitar amplifiers and cabinets. Not to mention comfortable couches everywhere you turn.
Leisure activities are well taken care of with a games room, dining room, and another space with an upright piano and couches for working out parts between sessions. The boutique interior design is a nod to the studio’s rich history, with lots of cosy colours and wooden paneling making it a very friendly and comfortable place to cut a record.
WANT IT MY WAY
Kaj says Sing Sing South’s USP is the studio’s ability to accommodate a variety of recording workflows. Pick an era and mimic its sound — because you won’t be limited by gear in this place. Everything you could want is at your disposal, from the 24-track two-inch Otari tape machine hooked up to the vintage Neve BCM console with 16 channels of 1073 preamps, to a full Pro Tools HDX ecosystem.
“If people want to mix in the ’70s they can go fully analogue if they want to. Or if they want to go ’80s they can still record analogue but do it on the SSL. But if they want to work in the box we’ve got all the plug-ins as well. The Pro Tools HDX gives over 200 input channels. Workflow-wise, we can cover anything from the ’50s right up to the current because we have the whole range.”
It’s true. Sing Sing South is outboard central, and it’s a wonder there’s room for it all. Some of it was sold during the moving process but Kaj affirms the best vintage gear has made the transition without hope of retirement. After all, it’s what makes Sing Sing, sing.
SING SING EAST
Sing Sing Recording Studios has recently partnered with Box Hill Institute which is in the process of building a new facility for its Audio and Composition program. Box Hill Institute has purchased a lot of gear from Sing Sing, including the SSL 9000 K Console, that will all be installed in a very spacious new tracking and mixing suite out at the Box Hill Campus. This will become Sing Sing East. Stay tuned for its opening in 2018.almonds, honey, pastry, pistachios
I’m still writing up this week’s Sunday baking recipe, but as an appetizer, I’m putting up the baklava I made in the middle of last week.
And why did the crazy woman make baklava in the middle of the week? Because she can, darlings!
OK, truthfully, because she defrosted phyllo over the Fourth of July weekend, dreaming all kinds of big phyllo-wrapped dreams, but never actually got around to realizing any of them. Instead, I made a simple spinach, potato and feta pie for dinner on Tuesday, using one of the two individually-wrapped 8-oz sleeves in the pack. Then, looking down at the third of a roll of dough left in the sleeve, I thought, what the hell, I’ll make baklava while I’m at it.
Although I have a few legitimate Greek cookbooks, I chose the Cook’s Illustrated Best International Recipe version as a starting point because I had yet to cook out of that book despite having obtained it it nearly two years ago as a result of the temporary insanity that led me to sign up for the CI cookbook club.
In addition to roughly quartering the quantities to fit the amount of dough I had, I made a couple of modifications in terms of ingredients and technique. First, regardless of its supposed superiority over plain melting, there was no way I was clarifying butter at 9:00 pm on a work day. I also chose the more adventurous combination of almonds and pistachios over their walnut-almond mix.
The combination of almonds and pistachios worked well, because pistachios alone can be a little overwhelming in baklava, and almonds by themselves don’t have enough character to stand up to the honey syrup. The CI approach of creating three thin layers of nut filling produces a nicely flaky and cohesive pastry without the usual tendency to slide and split in half when picked up. It was nicely saturated all the way through with this quantity of syrup, but next time I might double it just to ensure a completely hedonistic experience.
Baklava is never going to be an effortless endeavor, but this was ready to bake by the time the spinach pie came out of the oven, and it makes a perfectly reasonable quantity for a small household instead of enough to feed an army. It does need to sit several hours to absorb the syrup, so you won’t be eating it until morning unless you’re an even more incorrigible night owl than I am. The reward for your evening industriousness is sticky, buttery, crisp, perfect baklava with your breakfast coffee.
Almond-Pistachio Baklava
Serves 2-6
Syrup:
5 tablespoons granulated sugar
3 tablespoons honey
2 strips lemon zest
1-inch piece of cinnamon stick
2 cloves
1 pinch salt
2 teaspoons lemon juice
Pastry:
2 ounces sliced, unsalted almonds
1 ounce roasted, salted pistachios
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
Generous pinch of ground cloves
1/2 tablespoon granulated sugar
1 stick unsalted butter, melted
1/4 lb phyllo sheets
Combine sugar, honey, zest, and spices for the syrup in a small saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat until sugar has dissolved, stirring or swirling the pot as necessary. Transfer to a heat-safe cup, remove the lemon peel and cinnamon stick, stir in the lemon juice, and set aside to cool.
Adjust oven rack to the lower-middle position and preheat the oven to 300 F. Liberally butter the bottom and sides of a glass baking dish approximately 8 x 6 x 2.
Process nuts in a food processor until finely chopped, and transfer to a small bowl. Remove 1 tablespoon of nut mixture for the final garnish, then add cinnamon, cloves, and 1/2 tablespoon of sugar to remaining nuts.
Unroll the phyllo and cut to fit the size of the pan. Place one sheet in the bottom of the pan, and brush the entire surface with melted butter. Repeat with 9 more sheets, then sprinkle the top with one third of the nut filling. Cover the filling with 6 more individually-buttered sheets, and the next third of the filling. Repeat with another 6 sheets and the final third of nut mixture. Top with 8-10 more sheets of phyllo.
Using your flat palms, press out any air bubbles in the pastry, then brush on the remaining butter. Using a serrated knife, cut the baklava into diamonds, making sure to pierce all the way through the bottom layers.
Bake 1 1/2 hours or until completely golden, rotating the pan halfway through. Remove from oven and immediately pour all but 2 tablespoons of the syrup along each crevice, then drizzle the remaining syrup over the top. Sprinkle a generous pinch of the reserved ground nuts on the center of each piece.
Cool on a wire rack for 2-3 hours, then cover with foil and let stand 8 hours or overnight.

State Registration
Novartis Crop Protection, Inc.

Dear Mr. Harrison:
Re: Registration of a Major Change in Use for Fludioxonil Contained in Medallion M Fungicide (EPA Reg. No. 100-769)
Novartis Crop Protection, Inc. submitted an application and supporting documentation on March 27, 1997 for the registration of Medallion Fungicide (EPA Reg. No. 100-769), containing the active ingredient fludioxonil, for use to control certain foliar and soil-borne diseases in ornamental plants grown in containers, greenhouses and other enclosed structures.
Fludioxonil
is currently registered in New York State in the pesticide product Maxim 4FS (EPA Reg. No. 100-758) for use as a seed treatment to control certain fungal diseases in field and sweet corn, popcorn and sorghum. The Department determined that the proposed use of Medallion on ornamentals in enclosed structures represents a major change in label for fludioxonil.
Medallion is a protectant fungicide containing 50% fludioxonil [4-(2,2-difluoro-1,3-benzdioxol-4-yl)-1H-pyrrole-3-carbonitrile, a pyrrolnitrin derivative] which can be applied through irrigation and by either soil drench or foliar spray methods. Medallion controls damping-off and root and stem rot disease caused by Rhizoctonia spp. Medallion may be used as a soil drench on ornamentals at the time of seeding or transplanting, or on established plants. Medallion is also used as a foliar spray for control of Botrytis spp., foliar Rhizoctonia spp., and Alternaria spp. on ornamentals. Medallion is mixed at the rate of one eight-ounce packet per 100 gal. water and is applied at the rate of up to one pt/sq. ft using one application for seedlings. Medallion is used on transplants and cuttings using two to four eight-ounce packets/100 gal. of water. This application may be repeated in 21-28 days if needed. Medallion is mixed at the rate of 4-16 packets/100 gal. of water when used as a foliar spray and this application may be repeated at 7-14 day intervals.
The Department has completed its review of the subject product. The findings and conclusions are discussed below, broken down by Ecological, Human Health and Groundwater impacts.
Ecological Effects:
Minimal exposure to fish and wildlife is expected from the use of fludioxonil in greenhouses and other enclosed structures.
Human Health Effects:
While fludioxonil has been previously evaluated as to human health effects, the Medallion registration package contained some additional toxicity information as well as acute toxicity data for the Medallion product. The acute toxicity data for Medallion indicate that it is not very toxic, irritating or a sensitizer.
It has been noted that fludioxonil caused an increased incidence of heptacellular tumors in female rats and a positive dose-related trend for total lymphomas in females in one mouse oncogenicity study. A second study in mice, which included higher dose levels, did not report an increased tumor incidence in either sex. At the time of the first review, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) had not yet classified fludioxonil as to its oncogenic potential, and the USEPA Registration Eligibility Decision document states that no additional uses (other than seed treatment) of this compound should be registered until the Carcinogenicity Peer Review Committee has evaluated the carcinogenicity data. The Committee has now classified fludioxonil as a Group D (not classifiable as to human carcinogenicity) compound.
The USEPA estimated exposure and risks to mixer/loader/applicators of medallion from soil drench treatment and foliar spray treatment were estimated to be 0.2995 milligrams/kilogram body weight/day (mg/kg/day) and 0.0477 mg/kg/day, respectively. Medallion can be applied repeatedly at certain intervals, but chronic daily use by workers is not expected. To evaluate worker risks, the USEPA compared estimated exposures to a no-observed-effects level (NOEL) from an oral subchronic dog study (50 mg/kg/day) and calculated margins of exposure of 167 and 1,048 for soil drench and foliar spray treatments, respectively. In a rat developmental toxicity study, an increased incidence of dilated renal, pelvis and ureter in offspring was reported at a dose level of 1,000 mg/kg/day, with a NOEL of 100 mg/kg/day. Margins of exposure for soil drench and foliar spray are 334 and 2,096, respectively, based on comparison of exposure estimates to this NOEL.
Medallion is labeled for use on ornamental plants grown in containers, greenhouses and other enclosed structures. Given this use, exposure of the general public to fludioxonil from Medallion use should be minimal. In addition, risk estimates for workers handling Medallion are at levels generally accepted as adequate for occupational exposures.
Groundwater Impacts:
The Department did not review this indoor use as they had previously reviewed fludioxonil for outdoor use as a seed treatment and had no objection to its registration.
Registration Action:
Therefore, based on the above reviews, the Department accepts for registration in New York State the pesticide product Medallion Fungicide (EPA Reg. No. 100-769) for use as federally/D. Luttinger, NYS Dept. of HealthDid you know…? TU Dresden Welcome Center offers Farewell Service

Is the home of John & Mary Carter, their two young boys, George and Bob, the boys 'Nana and Grandad', Doreen and Gary, our 36 Satanta Siberian Huskies, three Scandinavian hounds, three collies, two Maremma sheepdogs working as Stock Guardian Dogs, a flock of registered Hebridean sheep, rare breed Hungarian Wooly Pigs (Mangalitza pigs), some rescue hens, a Whitebred Shorthorn bull and the Glasclune Fold of pedigree Highland Cattle.
Our life with huskies all began when John was encouraged by a friend to try running his Brother and Sister-in-Law’s Siberian huskies – and once tried, was immediately hooked so began training and competing with their huskies initially. He soon got his own husky puppies which were added to the team once they came of age. John later imported two Siberian Huskies, Barrow (AKA Bow) and Superior (AKA Scoop), from one of the top racing kennels, Lokiboden, in Canada in the early 90’s – The majority of our Siberian huskies within our kennel are descendants of ‘Bow’ and he was also the inspiration for ‘Bow’land Trails name. .
Mary began handling and training with her friend's huskies, and eventually ran a borrowed team in the mid to late 1990's, getting her own huskies in 1999. John and Mary met through racing and training huskies, and married in 2007 at Bowland Trails .
We both like to get the very best out of our dogs, and consequently we have both won a multitude of British and Scottish championships with our various team sizes from 1 up to 8 dogs. Internationally, John has gained many podium places racing at Dryland European & World championships with 6 and 8 dog teams. Just recently, November 2017, John won the title of WSA World Dryland Champion, racing at the World Sleddog Association World Championships in Italy with his 8-dog team and took a bronze medal at the International Federation of Sleddog Sports World Dryland Championship in Poland.
In 2015 Mary became the IFSS World Champion by winning the World Cup with their 8 dog team, and also took 3rd place in the world cup that same year with their 4 dog team. In 2016 Mary was crowned IFSS European Champion with her 6-dog team, and in November 2017 won the Silver Medal at the IFSS World Dryland Championship in Poland.
John moved here on Halloween 2001 - and set about creating a network of trails on the 220 acre site for running his Championship winning Siberian Huskies in harness as well training other peoples lead dogs to be good command leaders.
Since then, apart from the sleddog training activities, and after many requests, we now offer the very popular Siberian husky rides – where people can take a ride as a passenger with a large team of our huskies.
Bowland trails has hosted a multitude of sleddog race events each year for various clubs and organisations. Bowland Trails often hosts the Sled Dog Association of Scotland Championship final in March, has hosted British Championship races and had the honour of hosting the European Canicross Federation European Championship race event in 2015 – which attracted competitors from 13 nations across the whole of Europe.Recently, good news from State Intellectual Property Bureau: Guangdong SIRUI Optical Co.,Ltd was acknowledged as "National Intellectual Property Advantage Enterprise" which is another honor on intellectual property after SIRUI has been awarded with "Guangdong Intellectual Property Advantage Enterprise", "2016 Guangdong Paten Gold Award".
Meanwhile, SIRUI also successfully passed "State Intellectual Property Management System Certification" to be one of the minority enterprises passing this certification at the earliest time. All these honors means that SIRUI was highly recognized on the capability of independent innovation and the management of innovative products and intellectual property.
SIRUI always insists on branding and acquiring intellectual property by independent innovation.

Demona: The images of rows and rows of fishes on this gigantic banner hanging outside the restaurant was definitely an eye catcher to anyone who passes by. So much so that even if you were standing on the other end of the lot, you could still faintly see it.
However, it wasn’t the fishes which caught much of our attention. Instead, it was the two digit number that was printed next to the fishes, the beautiful number of 1 2 and the two alphabets before them, R M.
RM 12/ one full fish woey.!?
We could hardly believe our eyes. Well at least, for KL’s price of fishes, that is.
Demona: Fatty Tiger was fairly packed, so we proceeded upstairs. Biz looked good for the taukehs here as several tables were occupied upstairs as well. The menu boasts of a huge range of river rishes, which a frog-under-the-coconut-shell person like myself, wouldn’t know how to differentiate except some obvious difference in shapes and sizes between the several few.
Some fishes had golden bar price tags, potentially costing a mere fish head alone to be several hundred bucks (WOW!)
We hunted for the RM12/fish but couldn’t spot it on the menu. The waitress came up and explained to us that there was such a fish at such a price. These particular riverfishes are reared by the taukeh and sold at a real good deal price, and they do not make much profit out of this. Instead, their profit targets are more on the higher end river rishes eg: the golden price tag fishes.
Demona: Poor RM 12 river fish, you. Fed to the right size, and scooped right out of its pond and in it went, into a pack of ice, waiting to be served fresh to the next customer…… US.
Demona: Sorry, fishy fish. You were the chosen one to serve us. Cooked assam nyonya style. Initially, the sauce was really spicy and sour, yet at the end palate, the sweetness of the pineapples showed up. The fish meat was fairly fresh. We had this fish, cooked plain steamed before, and my gf who joined in the dinner mentioned that there was a slight muddy taste to it but thankfully, wasn’t obvious enough to put you off eating it further. With the assam nyonya paste, the mud taste was of course, covered.
Anyhow, in usual circumstances, almost all self reared riverfishes couldn’t run too far from having the distinct muddy taste to their meat as they have less room to freely swim about, unlike their wild river fish brothers.
Demona: Dogma ordered a Dried Chillis Fried Chicken rice to eat along with the fish. The chicken meat was quite tender, with a nice fragrant aroma of ginger, onions and dried chillies absorbed into the meat. Deliciouso! As for me, the usual rice skipper…. I also stole half of Dogma’s chicken slices away. Grrrrrrrrrr.
I’m guessing the owner will shake his head whenever he sees people like us coming in, as we chose the cheapes fish, and ate the least (some more share meal!). If there are more of us diners coming in, the restaurant’s profit margin’s going to decline drastically.
On the contrary, the owner came up to us instead, with a big sincere smile, explaining to us about the fish which we ate, as well as the other fishes that he was selling, and even brought those expensive dead fishes on a tray, just to show us. He did subtly mentioned that the profit earnings for the RM12/fish was not much but that did not affect him severely as this strategy also earned him more happy return customers who potentially have golden goose pockets, and willing to explore more than just the RM12/fish deal.
This is one restaurant that we shall always come to whenever we feel like having good olde’ fish meat to eat and not having to burn our wallets too much.This is a quick, non-riff-related, aside that I felt compelled to publish for some reason. A couple weeks ago a trailer for a movie entitled “Annihilation” was released. You can watch that below.
Now the reason for my rambling is that this movie (in title) is based off of the first book in Jeff VanderMeers Southern Reach trilogy. Out of all the sci-fi I’ve read recently, this series is damn near the bottom of the list when it came to film adaptations I thought would happen.
While some stuff I’ve read makes sense for the screen and has even ended up there already (see; The Expanse), Southern Reach and Annihilation in particular, is such a mindfuck that I thought there was no way in hell it would get made. The book is a creepy and unsettling combination of Lovecraftian horror and conspiracy. It generates questions page after page, half of which there will never be a concrete answer for. This is not a series where you get a nice, rational end result. It’s a series with many things left to interpretation and in some cases, unresolved mystery.
Shot as a lower-budget art flick? Sure, that could have worked. Hell, half the effects they tacked on in the trailer aren’t present in the book. I can only really see this going two ways; either it (somehow) nails the source material and tanks financially or it manages to bastardize the original work so much it sells to the general public.
Either way I guess I’ll have to watch it and find out next year. If you’re into creepy and confusing reading, I highly recommended the entire Southern Reach series.A UKSBD Service - Subscribe to UKSBD : Review

My recipe has a little kick to it because that's what we like. Coffee and wine enhance flavors, and the paprika and chipotle chile powder give a little kick. For us, this is 6-7 servings, but we're small eaters. Although I will say when it comes to beef stew, we both tend to eat more than we would normally.
Beef Stew
Source: Judy's Kitchen
INGREDIENTS: 1/3 cup all-purpose flour
1 tsp. sea salt
1/4 tsp. black pepper
1/2 tsp. chipotle chile pepper
1 tsp. paprika
2.5 lbs. beef chuck, cut into bite-sized pieces, excess fat removed
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
2 cups coarsely chopped onions (about 1 large)
1 Tbsp. chopped fresh garlic
1 cup coarsely chopped celery
1 cup dry red wine, drinking quality (I used Firenze 2006 Chianti)
1 15-oz. can diced tomatoes
1/2 cup water
1/2 tsp. instant coffee powder
1 cup coarsely chopped parsley
2 large baking potatoes, peeled, cut in large pieces
2 carrots, peeled, cut in chunks
1/2 cup coarsely chopped parsley
DIRECTIONS: Preheat oven to 300 degrees F. Mix flour and seasonings in gallon size resealable plastic bag. Add beef, seal bag and shake to distribute flour evenly over beef. Heat oil in large skillet. Add beef with any excess flour, onions, garlic, and celery. Saute' over medium heat till beef is lightly browned and vegetables start to cook, about 5-10 minutes. Turn heat up to high and pour wine over skillet. Let it bubble up for a minute or two and scrape up any residue on the bottom of the pan; then add the tomatoes, water, coffee powder and parsley. After the mixture comes to a boil, spoon or pour it into a 9x12 baking dish and bake it in the oven, covered, for 2-3 hours. Remove cover, add potatoes, carrots and parsley and cook, uncovered for 1 hour.This page was generated on 2018-01-16 08:18:13 -0500 (Tue, 16 Jan 2018).

DEAR ABBY: I can‘t stand my 10-year-old daughter. I was an 18-year-old single mother when she was born. I find her ugly and annoying. Everyone tells me how "sweet" and “pretty” she is, but I can‘t‘t. —ABBY
Gabby's Reply
Hi Anonymous: You ask what's wrong with you. There's nothing wrong with you providing (and this is extremely important) you are willing and able to follow these instructions. If you read the following and pooh pooh it or simply can't bring yourself to follow these instructions then you reveal that you need a minimum of 25-hours of therapy.
If you don't follow the instructions, and, don't do the therapy, then your treatment of your daughter will continue to inflict even more damage on your husband and sons, only from now on it will be premeditated. You won't be able to tell anyone, perhaps through jail bars, that you didn't know. And yes, the damage to everyone has been that bad. However, you can clean it all up with a series of sit-down conversations with everyone beginning with your daughter.
Let's assume that you don't need therapy but that you've simply been stuck in your communication mastery curriculum. It's not your fault. Teachers don't teach students how to communicate, they only introduce students to the fundamentals of communication. You're experiencing a communication breakdown, one that forces you to attempt to deliver the same communications over and over but non verbally and psychically. You've been repeating some very uncomfortable communications non verbally all these years because no one in your life has been able to get you, to acknowledge you for your thoughts. This means that both you and your husband have been unconscious. A conscious man would not have married you until you had either cleaned up your relationship with your parents and your daughter, or estranged yourself from your parents until they had completed 25 hours of therapy each. Unfortunately he has been unconsciously empowering you in abusing your daughter; he too is reaping the karma of abuse; in other words, you have been non verbally communicating to him and your sons, "Please help me, I don't want to treat her this way, I just don't know how to stop." but, because they too have been unconscious, they couldn't see it or they themselves didn't know how to stop you.
No matter how healthy and well adjusted your sons may appear to be you've been modeling for them how to destroy relationships by withholding thoughts, how to torture and damage another without leaving physical marks, and how to stand by and watch (actually it's intend) another being abused so as to not receive the same treatment (it's referred to as the “good” German phenomena). I assure you at some level it bothers them to watch you treat her as you do; they feel guilty and ashamed; it bothers them so much that it gets in the way of their potential, especially communications between them and their teachers. They intuitively know they should say something, to speak up in defense of their sister but they've compromised their integrity, thus it has been their intention, however unconscious, for you continue treating her abusively. In other words, you've enrolled them in empowering you to abuse their sister. They have already learned from you that it's not only OK but that it's how one must treat girls. They will do everything in their power to emulate you so as to please you their leader.
What's even worse is that you have enrolled your husband in supporting you in abusing another; he gets an imitation of intimacy and harmony at the expense of another's happiness and well-being. I say “imitation” because whatever you may be calling intimacy is nowhere near real because there has been abuse in the space. Given that it's been your leadership communication skills that have been supporting the others in your abuse of her it can't be having good karma for you or anyone. Another motivation to follow these instructions, to do the free Communication Process (see below) is that eventually the karma will start to manifest itself physically with behavior/health issues.
Re: "I am not physically abusive to her - I would never do that." As though mental abuse is any less abusive. A broken arm can mend but the effects of the verbal abuse surrounding the breaking of an arm lasts longer, for most, a lifetime.
Re: "She just makes me so mad." This reveals your addiction to blaming. A conscious person would have caught the lie in the sentence—that she's the source of your anger—and would have deleted the sentence and written, "I find myself blaming her for my anger."
Your problem will disappear once you share with her all the thoughts about her that have been floating around in your mind all these years. I know this sounds strange but your polite act is wreaking havoc on the entire family. You need to verbally communicate to her (responsibly) what you've been delivering non verbally.
Here's a free communication process that will restore everyone's integrity, however, it's written specifically for you and your daughter. Later you can do the process with the other family members. Click here to take you to the free Communication Process.

Until recently, and like many other fellow data scientists I have talked to, I built data science pipelines on my local machine or a remote host while relying on virtual environments. In doing so, I ensured some degree of replicability by keeping check of language versions, library versions, and so on. While this is a fairly efficient process that facilitated shared coding and portability, I do occasionally run into a common, recurring error.
For better or for worse, much of my development is performed on my local machine, and on the occasion where datasets or RAM requirements are too large, I will rely on a DigitalOcean droplet or EC2 instance to resolve that problem. However, neither of these cases tend to be the final step, as I will often refactor/modify my code in order to productionalize it into something that won’t terrify the code delivery team. In many cases, this will involve transitioning to a different machine or OS, such as moving from MAC OS to Ubuntu 14.04, and this is where the pain points with virtual environments appear. Often I will find myself configuring the OS to my requirements, installing the correct Python version, gcc compilers and BLAS libraries, which invariably leads to minor (sometimes major) conflicts, bugs and annoyances. More importantly, there is no way to really persist all these efforts should you wish to run this on another machine or have someone reproduce your code independently.
Docker solves all these issues!
What does Docker do?
Paraphrasing from their website,, Docker offers the ability to
contain ALL your code and dependencies into a single
container, and never have to worry about it ever again (actually those were exactly the same words, but less well-written…). This was an intriguing concept, and the more qualified engineers around me assured me that it was also a
good concept, so I decided to integrate this as part of my regular workflow. In the following, I will go through the steps to get started and create your first Docker container for a data science project, and hopefully convince you that Docker should be integrated as part of your regular workflow along the way!
If you haven’t already, you can install Docker on your local machine using the instructions at the following link. Once that is done, you can go ahead and find the Docker Quickstart Terminal icon, double-click on it, and see a new terminal window appear with the following output:
Last login: Tue Feb 16 21:43:51 on ttys005 bash --login '/Applications/Docker/Docker Quickstart Terminal.app/Contents/Resources/Scripts/start.sh' TLV-private:~ ThomasVincent$ bash --login '/Applications/Docker/Docker Quickstart Terminal.app/Contents/Resources/Scripts/start.sh' Machine default already exists in VirtualBox.

docker is configured to use the default machine with IP XXX.XXX.XX.XXX For help getting started, check out the docs at TLV-private:~ ThomasVincent$
Now that Docker is up and running, we can begin to build the main components of our container. For now, we will assume that you have a Python script that you want to automatically run every time you run a Docker container (although as we will see, other use cases can easily be adapted).
The basics
The very simplistic workflow for creating your own Docker container is the following:
- Create a file called
Dockerfile, which we will use to place the relevant instructions and commands that will define what our container can do.
- Build the Docker container, this will install and apply all the environnment variables and configurations that you have specified in the Dockerfile.
- Run the Dockerfile and reap the benefits of fully reproducible research across any computing platform!
Writing your own Dockerfile
A Dockerfile is usually started by specifying a base image from which you would like to start. Here, we will use the Ubuntu 14.04 image. It is also customary to specify the maintainer/creator of the Docker container you are about to create.
# specifiy base image FROM ubuntu:14.04 # provide creator/maintainer of this Dockerfile MAINTAINER Thomas Vincent <your_email_address@something.com>
The ubuntu:14.04 image comes as a very barebones implementation of the Linux OS, so it is up to us to specify some of the useful system tools and libraries that we would like to include:
#
At this point, we are in a good position to also install the Python and the pip Python package manager.
# install Python and pip package manager RUN apt-get install -y python \ python-dev \ python-distribute \ python-pip
As pip is installed, we can now go ahead and install commonly used Python libraries and other more specific ones that may be required by your Python script or web app.
# intall useful and/or required Python libraries to run your script RUN pip install matplotlib \ seaborn \ pandas \ numpy \ scipy \ sklearn \ python-dateutil \ gensim
Once you are sure that all the required Python libraries have been added, you can go ahead and define the command that you would like to when your Docker conatiner starts. In this case, we specify to run your Python script.
# define command to when Docker container starts ENTRYPOINT ["python"] CMD ["my_script.py"]
In all, your Dockerfile should look like this
# specifiy base image FROM ubuntu:14.04 # provide creator/maintainer of this Dockerfile MAINTAINER Thomas Vincent <your_email_address@something.com> # # install Python and pip package manager RUN apt-get install -y python \ python-dev \ python-distribute \ python-pip # intall useful and/or required Python libraries to run your script RUN pip install matplotlib \ seaborn \ pandas \ numpy \ scipy \ sklearn \ python-dateutil \ gensim # define command to when Docker container starts ENTRYPOINT ["python"] CMD ["my_script.py"]
Considering how much Docker can simplify your life, this is a pretty small and straighforward amount of code to have to write!
Building and running your Docker container
Now that you have written your own Dockerfile, you can go ahead and build the entire image. If you haven’t already, follow the instructions at the beginning of this post to ensure that you are running from within the Docker Terminal. Be sure that you are also working from within the directory in which your Dockerfile and Python script are located. You can then build your first Docker image by simply typing:
docker build -t your_image_name .
The
-t flag allows you to name the docker container as whatever pleases you. When pressing enter, you should see a fair amount of logging information and other miscallaneous output displayed to your console. Once the build is finished, you can then go straight ahead and run your Docker image, which will compute or output whatever your Python script was intended to do!
docker run -t your_image_name
Shutting down your docker container
Once you are done with your docker container, you can shut it down by using the command
docker rm -f CONTAINER_ID
where the CONTAINER_ID value can be found by running
docker ps
Conclusions
We have covered a simple use case for Docker that allowed us to produce a running instance of a Python script that - along with all of its required dependencies - can be seamlessly ran across any system. In many ways, we have only scratched the surface of what can be done with Docker, but hopefully this demonstrates how useful it can be (and that is why it has seen an explosive growth in adoption across all segments of the tech industry!)He's too old. He's forgetful. He doesn't know where he is. He's a doddering old fool with no business being in the race.
Sound familiar? Maybe not as familiar as you think.
These sentiments were uttered about Admiral James Stockdale in 1992 after a bad performance at the Vice Presidential debate. Compared to Dan Quayle and Al Gore, he certainly looked like it. Even though Stockdale had more gravitas than the two knuckleheads he was on stage with combined, he never got over the stigma of being "too old."
Now, Democrats are resurrecting these same arguments against John McCain. If the Democrats are successful, they won't need to "swift boat" McCain because they will have already "Stockdaled" him. And Republicans and conservatives have to figure out a way to counteract it or it will catch on.
The problem McCain faces is, well, he is older than Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. With his medical issues, it's a second strike against him. And if nobody from the McCain side does or says anything to address these issues and calm voters' fears, it won't matter what McCain says. He will be framed by his opponents, and they will not give up ground to let him get back on his feet.
And, no, cries of "ageism" won't cut it.
The key to beating the Democrats on the age issue lies in the past and Ronald Reagan. Reagan managed to bounce back after a dismal first debate with Walter Mondale with a simple statement about him not making his opponents youth and inexperience against him. McCain needs a Reagan moment like this to put down the "he's too old" line once and for all. The sooner he does this, the better. Given the fact that Hillary and Obama are looking and sounding like immature brats, now is the time to strike.
The alternative? Looking like Bob Dole stumbling over his own website address during one of the debates in 1996.BACKGROUND
Bishop Heber High School is situated in the village of Malpas, serving students across South West Cheshire. The school currently has 1,000 pupils and
provides a safe and caring environment, through which it encourages respect, opportunity and achievement. Being at the forefront of technology provision for both staff and students plays a key part in helping the school achieve its vision, along with an understanding of the technical requirements to help everything run smoothly.
PROBLEM/OBJECTIVE
Like many other secondary schools across the country, Bishop Heber was keen to embrace new ways for teachers to deliver content to students, making lessons more engaging and informative. As such, presentations were becoming more multimedia-based, using video clips and online content. Storage of these large files (some up to 50MB each) was putting a huge strain on the existing data storage system, which was made up of plug-in USB drives and was fast reaching capacity. The way in which files were shared between teachers also needed reviewing, with staff using USB pens and laptops to store their presentations and emailing the large files to colleagues.
In addition, the school has also seen a big rise in the amount of other forms of data it needs to manage,
including emails and media streaming. The resilience of the storage was also a cause for concern in the ICT
department, with no back-up in place should servers (and disks) fail. Physical space and budget was also
at a premium, so the department was reluctant to bolt on any more USB storage devices.
SOLUTION
The school needed a more cost-effective, scalable solution to meet its ever expanding storage needs. Through IT partner i7 Technologies Limited, Gary Naylor – ICT network and SIMS manager at Bishop Heber High School – looked into the options for a more resilient SAN solution. Already a trusted partner for networking and wireless support, the school selected to work with NETGEAR for the upgrade. To ensure the right solution was put in place, i7 Technologies arranged for NETGEAR to conduct a site survey to assess storage needs. Gary also needed to get buy-in from senior management to overhaul the system, with many questioning why using more plug-in devices was not an option. NETGEAR recommended its ReadyDATA 5200 product with a 180TB capacity and deduplication features. As part of the process, NETGEAR brought in a device to show Gary exactly how it worked and what he was getting for his money, so he was able to see how it would provide real value for the school and grow with its needs.
The ReadyDATA 5200 not only provided all of the functionality that Gary needed, but was a more cost-effective option than the Fujitsu and HP storage the school previously used, giving him the ammunition needed to get management go-ahead. Throughout the transition to the new system, NETGEAR staff were on-hand to provide support and manage any initial teething problems, with all queries and issues resolved within 24 hours
RESULTS
With the school’s storage needs rising from 1TB 6 years ago to 7TB today, the NETGEAR solution provides more than enough capacity to meet the school’s needs now and in the future. Back-ups are now happening more quickly and files are able to be restored with ease if accidentally deleted, without having to go through the back-up software. Staff can easily save and share data rather than having to email or transfer files via USB pens. Gary and his team now have more time to focus on other aspects of their role instead of spending hours scanning and deleting duplicate files to free up space on the server. The deduplication facility means that this now happens automatically, and all that is needed is an occasional scan and delete of files that shouldn’t be saved on the school system. Moving forward, the school is looking to add another ReadyDATA unit, so the two can mirror each other and provide backup in the event of a technical issue or access problem. It also plans to work with NETGEAR to upgrade its wireless network and improve performance across all buildings on the school site.

Contents
SSH is one of the best inventions since sliced bread. With the advent of networked computing, remote access to a system was a given. Networks are susceptible to sniffing, so it wasn't until SSH that you could rely on a secure terminal session. Use of SSH could have prevented Kevin Mitnick's spoofing attack on Tsutomu Shimomura in 1995.
A sad fact of SSH is that we're still using passwords. Passwords are pretty hopeless, by and large. Noone likes having to remember passwords, let alone different passwords for different things. Passwords can also be lost, forgotten or stolen. They're not ideal for their job, which is helping you prove that you're you.
The use of secure passwords or more so the prevention of the use of passwords in place of more secure authentication methods discussed is of particular importance in a web hosting environment. Web hosting servers are connected to a public network from which by default any of the millions of Internet users can attempt to maliciously compromise the security of the server.
That said, SSH is indispensable, and there's plenty we can do to improve the situation. If you've already been compromised, you probably want to do some cleanup right now, this article may help: Security Cleanup of a Compromised Hacked or Cracked Host
Passwords
Short passwords
The first problem most people have with passwords is that they're too short. Older systems used to have an 8-character limit on passwords; anything longer would be ignored. Modern computers are very fast and can test every possible 8-character password in no time at all (this is called "brute-forcing"). This is made even worse by the fact that many people choose short AND easily-guessable passwords. If you're trying to break someone's password, you'll do well by trying dictionary words first, along with names of pets, kids, relatives, holiday destinations, etc.
If you're still unconvinced, security guru Bruce Schneier ran an article a couple of years ago about an analysis of 34,000 stolen Myspace account passwords. The average password is 8-characters long, and uses only letters and numbers. That's a lot of possible passwords but it doesn't really matter, seeing as plenty are easily guessable.
There's a cute saying about writing that goes something like, "sentences are like a girl's skirt: the shorter the better, but they should cover the most important parts". Passwords are the exact opposite, they should fall all the way to the ground! (maybe with some nice knife pleats, but I digress)
Long passwords
Short passwords have been known for a long time, and most large organisations will have policies enforcing the use of longer passwords. This can effectively thwart dictionary and brute-force attacks, but opens the door to another class of problems. Noone will ever guess "uhe8734ytc83y4t77tynycntse4ys" as your password, but when a password is too long to remember, everyone's first instinct is to write it down somewhere. All too often this is on a piece of paper close to the computer, stuck to the monitor for easy reading (!), under the keyboard, in a desk drawer, etc.
This is well and good if you're at home and the system you're logging into is on the other side of the world, but it just doesn't cut it in an environment where those who might set out to exploit you work in the same office.
Adding to this problem is the fact that long passwords are a hassle to type. If passwords are a hassle, people are especially inclined to pick easier (ie. weaker) passwords, defeating the purpose.
Better passwords
It seems that what we're after are passwords that are:
- long
- easy to remember
- resistant to attack
We can easily go a long way towards meeting these criteria. At Anchor, we use software to automatically generate randomised passwords for our users when we make a new account, or they need a reset. This is mostly for administrative efficiency, but we take advantage of the chance to produce more secure passwords. We could ask the user for a password they'd like, but as we know, users are notoriously bad at picking good passwords.
A random password generated by our system
change$cursor9Jack
The software strings together random dictionary words, separated by numbers and punctuation. You'll also notice the uppercase 'J' in 'Jack'. We've found these passwords are easy for users to remember, and even comical at times. A memorable password immediately thwarts the need to keep it written down.
It's quite long, meaning it's less susceptible to shoulder surfing if used in a public place. The use of punctuation and numbers increases the character space of the password and largely rules out guessing. Coupled with the length, this defeats the smarter brute-forcing techniques in crackers like John the Ripper, which try various "nearby" derivatives of dictionary words.
One final consideration is that our users don't get to choose it (they can change the password later if they feel like it, though). An easily-overlooked advantage is that the password is assured to be different from other passwords the user has. In the case of a compromise or password theft, the attacker doesn't get a free pass to the victim's other accounts (eg. online banking, medical matters).
This isn't perfect, but it's much closer to something you can be comfortable about using.
Public key authentication
So far we've covered passwords, which are now better, but they're still lacking. They still hinge on you proving that you know something. A better system is to use what's referred to as a "token", something you have in your possession. This is where public keys come in. (this is technically called a "keypair", consisting of a private key and a public key)
Public keys use asymmetric cryptography, meaning different keys are used for encrypting and decrypting data. The practical upshot of this is that you can prove that you possess the private key without showing it to anyone. This works well for SSH. You give the server your public key (it's not a secret, you can give it to anybody), then whenever you want to login, you can prove that you're in possession of the matching private key (your PC does some heavy-duty maths on your behalf).
If an attacker wants to login as you, they now need to steal your private key. It's not written down so they can't just pick it up or remember it, but it's still on your computer. If they can use your computer, they can steal your key. To prevent this, the key should be encrypted with a password. Yes, it's back to passwords again, but this is hugely more difficult to attack, now that you've got a long password that's easy to remember and hard to guess.
It's out of scope to cover the exact procedure for using public keys here, but good guides can be had and it's easy to setup.
Depending on how paranoid you are, you can also carry your keys on a removable USB drive. This helps keep them under your control, plus it's just plain cool.
Location-based access control
One of the core philosophies in security is Defense In Depth. This means that you don't rely on any one security measure to protect you, you use multiple layers. Castles are a great example of this; you'd have a moat, high walls, gates, guards, traps, etc. Attackers might be able to defeat one or some of these, but to get in they'd have to defeat ALL of them. That's defense in depth.
In most situations, you know who's going to be logging on to your system. For most of our customers, chances are it'll be themselves working from their home/office, and maybe their developers from their offices. So why would we be interested in letting some zombie computer in Russia or China even bother trying? Obviously we're not, and we can enforce it. In fact, this can be done in a number of places, which is a good defense against potential undiscovered bugs in different pieces of software.
If users are connecting from a fixed address/es, we can configure the firewall to only respond to requests from those addresses. Any other connections will be silently ignored, as though SSH isn't running at all. But what if the firewall is down? To this we can add TCP Wrappers, which allows us to implement similar restrictions. TCP Wrappers also allows you to easily log connections and perform other actions if required.
These measures aren't very fine-grained, however; there's no support for per-user restrictions. Our first stop here is with Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM). PAM isn't strictly coupled to SSH, it's an authentication layer provided by the OS. By making a small change to our PAM configuration, we can restrict access on a per-user basis.
First create the file /etc/security/ssh_users
# Each entry is a single line, and consists of three colon-separated fields; # 1. an allow/deny specifier (plus/minus respectively) # 2. the username # 3. the source of the connection +:username:.my.home.isp.net +:someotherguy:office.in.america.net +:anotherguy:12.34.56.78 -:ALL:ALL
Then edit your /etc/pam.d/sshd, adding a line to the start of the "account" entries
account required pam_access.so accessfile=/etc/security/ssh_users
The syntax is quite flexible, and you can specify remote hosts as fully qualified hostname, domain suffixes, IP addresses and IP ranges. For full details you should read the system's manual page for pam_access. This configuration of PAM can only be done at a system-wide level though, not as an ordinary user. For one final measure, you can do something like this as a user if you use public keys to login. SSH supports a "from" directive on your key, which states where it may be used from. This is specified in your authorized_keys files, prepended to each key listing.
from="*.anchor.net.au,*.randw1.nsw.optusnet.com.au" ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABIwAAetcetcetc=
With this, I'm allowing access from work, and a very specific Optus exchange (this gets around the fact that the IP address isn't static). By disabling the password on that account, I can enforce that access is ONLY possible with a public key, protected by a strong password, from a limited number of well-controlled locations.
Defence against brute-force attacks
If you have to use passwords, you're really hoping noone guesses your password. SSH already imposes a 2-second timer on failed password attempts and is vastly slower than an offline attack, but it doesn't actually stop someone trying. It also fills up your logs, which is just plain annoying and can lead to you running out of diskspace in an extreme situation.
Brute-force attacks are really obvious when you're watching them, it'd be nice to do something about it when you spot one. There's a few ways to do this, the one we deploy on most of our dedicated servers is called sshd_sentry. sshd_sentry is a perl script that watches the SSH logs. When it detects too many failed logins for an account in a short period of time, it'll add a temporary entry to the TCP Wrappers denial list. We find this to be quite effective, and helps protect against situations where SSH gets flooded with malicious login attempts and stops responding for a short while.
Another option available in modern kernels is a matching module called "recent". While not able to differentiate between users, it offers detection at a very early stage, in the firewall, before it gets far enough to waste time talking to the SSH daemon. The firewall maintains a table of recent activity, and can be configured to drop any requests from a remote IP address if it decides they're opening too many connections to be considered legitimate.
The best thing is that it's dead-easy to implement, it's only a few lines of iptables rules. It's nice to create a separate table for the brute-force matching, as it offers extra flexibility should you need to cover more services.
# make the table iptables -N brute # whitelist specific IPs/ranges iptables -A brute -s 202.4.224.0/20 -j RETURN # if they've "hit" twice in 15sec, just drop the packets and stop processing iptables -A brute -m recent --update --name brute --seconds 15 --hitcount 2 -j DROP # assuming they're not already dropped, record a "hit" iptables -A brute -m recent --name brute --set # if they get through, return to our regular rules iptables -A brute -j RETURN # elsewhere in our ruleset... # new ssh connections get checked for brute-forcing # we ONLY test new connections, otherwise we'll disrupt legitimate connections right after they're established iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport ssh -m state --state NEW -j brute # allow existing connections, or connections that got through the "brute" table without being harmed iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport ssh -j ACCEPT
There's a potential Denial of Service attack here if an attacker knows your IP address and spoofs requests to the SSH server, but judicious use of the --rttl flag to iptables can dodge this, along with whitelisting.
Appropriate access and security
The great thing about this is that you can mix and match to suit your situation and increase your security (thus reducing the chance of a compromise). As an example, it's widely recommended that remote access to the root account be disabled, but we believe there's more to it. We do in fact login to servers as root on a regular basis. We'd go nuts trying to manage servers otherwise. The catch is that only password-protected public keys are used, each staff member has their own for manageability. Access is only allowed from our office, which has a VPN link direct to the datacentre. The security here is a mix of technology and policy, something which is often overlooked.
The important thing is that it's appropriate for the task at hand. At the other end of the scale, we're not too concerned about an account that's only used for mail; we're happy enough to put a decent password on it and check our email from internet cafes.
As a practical example, the user running your website doesn't need the ability to run sudo (allowing escalation of privileges), so they shouldn't have it. If your site is broken, the last thing you want the attacker doing is using the system against you. For this reason, we create separate user accounts for site-content and management tasks.
Summary
By employing some (or all!) of the measures above, you can have an extremely secure system that isn't an onerous burden to login to on a day-to-day basis. On a well-implemented system the additional security will pose little extra hassle for legitimate users, but is clammed up tight against would-be intruders, who have to break multiple systems to get in (there's that Defense In Depth principle again).
We've seen our fair share of compromises of machines at Anchor, but these are few and far between. Most are on servers not managed by our team, and all of them could have been prevented. While not a comprehensive list, there are some features we notice in these systems that make them hard to secure effectively.
- Weak passwords are the Number 1 enemy that we've seen
- Systems with lots of users (lots of potential targets)
- Systems where accounts aren't directly managed by us (more chance for users to pick weak passwords)
- It may not be practical or feasible to setup public key authentication (non-techy userbase, remote sites make workstation setup difficult)
- Fast-changing userbase makes password/key management difficult/impractical
- Logins shared by multiple users (makes accountability a nightmare)
- Users needing to connect from varying locations (cripples the use of location-based controls)
- Administrators simply not being security-conscious, or unaware of these great security measures
If you're an Anchor customer and would like to ensure your dedicated server is using some (or ALL!) of the above principles please contact us. If you're not, we hope you found this article useful and please feel free to contact us to discuss any of the concepts discussed.

Whether you engage in professional ethanol production or need to ferment a minute group of ethanol at home, choosing the finest yeast can certainly enhance the quality and quantity of your final product.
Alcohols and spirits including whiskey, beer, wine, vodka, rum, etc have to move by means of a number of brewing and even distilling steps before they final up in your glass. These procedures start by firstly mixing the raw materials such as wheat, barley, corn, sugar, potatoes, grapes, apples, or any other ingredient depending on the country where the drinks are made and the end product that is expected, along with water. This mixture is boiled, milled, and cooled so as to support the activation of enzymes that alter all possible starch in the raw material into various fermentable sugars including sucrose, glucose, and fructose.
When the wort or mash is ready for fermentation then ideal ethanol yeast is included to kick-start the fermentation practice. Various varieties of active yeast are needed to ferment Unique variations of ethanol. various kinds of yeast have restrictions in the form of yeast temperature and alcohol tolerance. Subsequently, if you tend to generate beer or lager then you will need to have brewers yeast or saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast that can basically live through in mild alcoholic beverages. However, if you plan to generate wine then you will need to make use of wine yeast while vodka will require the utilize of vodka yeast that can even get by in 17% alcohol strength.
At the time yeast is merged into the mash or wort then the ethanol fermentation approach changes all fermentable sugars into ethanol. This process could last for days and you might also need another round of fermentation to fine-tune your ideal alcohol so that you attain that perfect color, taste and strength. You can also check out newer yeast varieties which includes turbo yeast that offers much better results than traditional yeast. This yeast can endure in higher temperatures and stronger alcohols, and can Therefore improve ethanol yield. This yeast can also generate a higher yield of ethanol from weaker mashes, which in turn makes it excellent value-for-money yeast.
Yeast ethanol fermentation is usually done in conical stainless steel vessels eventhough various breweries and distilleries also employ open vessels depending on the alcoholic beverage that have to be generated. It is also important that you apply procedures have to be followed strictly to generate the best quality alcohols or spirits. a variety of types of yeast that can survive in varying temperatures and alcohol strengths are mixed in the mash to yield ideal alcoholic beverages. Introducing high-quality ethanol yeast which includes turbo yeast can definitely enhance ethanol formation and even offer for better tasting alcohol with remarkable character.TJ's Health Bites

###I've blogged before about the stories I used to write in fifth grade, middle school, my freshman year of high school... well guess what, folks! Some of those stories have BOOK COVERS! And attached to those book covers are the stories that go with them and, oh man, they crack me up. I might need to share samples from some of those stories in another flashback.
This post is about book covers, so I'll begin with THIS:
I didn't get my first set of fancy colored pencils until 6th grade, so I made do with crayons. And check out the calligraphy in that title! Practicing calligraphy was one of 11-year-old Marisa's favorite pastimes.
(for those who recognized the frightening girl in the mirror - yes, that was me. You'll find brown-haired, blue-eyed, moley-faced characters on a lot of my covers because I learned how to draw people from looking in the mirror. Also, I never finished the drawing because I thought it was so darned ugly)
In this story, my main character's BFF dies. Her name was November Shane. I was a huge Guns N' Roses fan, you guys.
Also, I killed off someone in just about all of my stories. I loved killing characters. In fact, here is a little clip from the diary I kept when I was in 5th grade:
(also, in case you are wondering, this entry was from March - my diary did a great job of reminding me of those missing summer pages in that when I came to them, they were missing!)
According to my notes, I planned for the doll to have the hair and eyelashes of the dead girl... but how that could be when she disappeared and her body was found a hundred years later locked in a trunk behind a brick wall, I have no idea. But hey, not too bad for age 13!
And because it amuses me: The title page, complete with publishing information.
I didn't win. Heck, I wasn't even chosen from amongst my classmates to participate in the actual Faire - my story was pretty darned boring, despite the mildly interesting title. However, I wasn't upset. Only one book was chosen from each class to be entered into the contest, and the girl who won from my class asked me to do the illustrations for her book, which I did. That made me happy.
And now for a mermaid story (because there has to be a mermaid story somewhere - these are MY stories, after all):
Sadly, I cannot find the other book covers I drew, though I know they are around my house somewhere. Most of these I found in a file marked: MARISA'S TAXES '02. My organization skillz are clearly lacking.
Have a flashback of your own to share? Head on over to Tia's blog and join in the fun!
Have a great weekend, folks!
xoxo,

OMG you are so fun and brilliant! I'm so glad I know you! i love that - unexpected friendships! I want to write stories about that. Why do you think they were missing - those pages?
My missing book covers, Tina? Missing because they are probably stuffed in a folder marked: COOKING PROJECTS or a folder marked: WEDDING PHOTOS, or something like that. I basically try to get organized and then fail miserably when I begin stuffing papers wherever I find room for them. :D
I love everything about this post, Marisa!
Also, "According to my notes, I planned for the doll to have the hair and eyelashes of the dead girl... "
<3 <3 <3
I think you should do this.
This is just one more reason why I love you and bask in your awesomeness.
November Shane...wow :) Party on Wayne. I seriously sense you were immersed in VC Andrews books. See, only the most excellent Marisa Meyers would have gone that extra yard to draw her own book covers. Someday when they are doing the "True Hollywood Story" on you they are gonna drag these babies out. And yet again, your middle school art skills murder my 39 year old skills. Just sayin.
I liked looking at all the eyebrows after you mentioned the one...they're all so different and I can tell you really THOUGHT about the eyebrows. I wish I had started writing at a young age. And your posts are making me more sentimental about keeping my kids' work...their future selves thank you!
oh wow, you can definitely see the evolution in your art work but I think these are all excellent for a kid growing up and a great example of your dedication to being a writer since a very young age! How great to have these!
AMAZING! I would love to read some of these. They say never judge a book by it's cover - heck by these covers these book have got to be gems.
Natalie - Creepy dead girl dolls FTW! <3 I have many creepy middle school stories just begging to be rewritten by adult me. :)
Alyssa - Haha, I knew you'd love this post. And wouldn't you know it, November Shane had a sister called Rain. I kid you not.
Anita - I STILL think about eyebrows when I draw - they can make or break the face! Also, save those creative pieces!! My mom gave me a file cabinet when I was 11 to keep all my work in, and that's the only reason I have them today!
Katie - haha, thanks! :)
Emily - :D Thanks!! They are so much fun to read!
These are awesome - I had similar covers from elementary school, but I generally got bored from drawing them half way through so they all have very white backgrounds :-) My favorite, I think, was my "The A-Z's of Recycling" lol
That is an awesome flash back! :) You have great artistic skills! I couldn't draw like that even now even if I tried! :)
So fun!!
Love the Scooby Doo one...made me laugh.
Great flashback post!!
Have a great Mother's Day weekend!
oh my, these are wonderful! and so interesting to see the progression of your artwork. I wish I had saved some of my old art work.
Oh my gosh. I am about to get all fangirly and maybe a little Swim Fan all over you and your creativity. Can we just be best friends and get over this awkward courting phase?
You are SO FUNNY! Marisa's Taxes.. *snork*
Maybe you found making the covers taxing? :)
Or maybe you are brilliant, knowing you'd need to hang onto your taxes for years?
Either way, this is a wonderful slice of a creative childhood you've got here...
Fun!
Kate
I am IMPRESSED by your book covers! Seriously. And you had some really good book ideas, too. The one about the doll with the hair and eyelashes of the dead girl? Totally gave me the shivers.
Oh Marise,
I distinctly remember a good half of those book covers. They were so dramatic and serious, just like the stories we used to write.... more like the first page we used to write...until we moved on to the next book cover, amazing titles and character names. Thanks for sharing Marise, you're posts bring back such amazing memories :) xoxoxo Big hugsThe first trailer for Disney's upcoming Zootopia just dropped on the Walt Disney Animation Studios' YouTube channel, and it's priceless.

New research overturns longstanding assumption

“We have discovered there is a highly reproducible genomic response to injury that is essentially the same — no matter the patient’s individual genetic background, whether the injury was caused by major trauma or serious burns, or if recovery is rapid or complicated,” said Ronald G. Tompkins,.”
Tompkins is the Sumner M. Redstone Professor of Surgery at Harvard Medical School.
The Inflammation and Host Response to Injury consortium was established in 2001 to investigate how the human body responds to injury and what factors set off excessive, uncontrolled inflammation that can lead to sepsis such as said.  difference is how much they change and how soon they return to normal.
“With this knowledge we can begin to design therapies to promote improvement in patients who would otherwise have complicated recoveries,” he added. “We also can look at whether measuring genomic changes soon after injury can help us predict which patients will recover well and which will need the maximal treatment typically delivered in ICUs, which, in addition to being expensive, can sometimes be harmful.”
The collaborative program — which includes investigators from 20 academic research centers around the country — is supported by a grant from theNational Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) at the National Institutes of Health.

The rigid shell (hard boot) provides your child with lasting protection and good ankle support.
These skates are easy to put on and tighten thanks to the buckles that hold your foot in place. Once you've found the right position, no further adjustments are needed! How do you put on and fasten the skates? It's child's play!
The tongue on the front of the boots lets you adjust them to three sizes. This means that the skates grow with your child. The wide opening makes them easy to put on.

Oxelo is committed to helping your child skate safely, whatever their technical ability. We have chosen to fit all our children's products with rubber wheels and brakes instead of PVC, because our number one concern is your child's safety.
Unlike plastic, which skids but doesn't brake, rubber provides good traction. This stops your child from slipping when they push off, as well as helping them brake effectively. Rubber also wears out less quickly than plastic.
Repair and maintain your skates with the spare parts available in-store from the department or the workshop. Find our advice and tutorials on the Oxelo YouTube channel:
The brakes can be used on the right or left (spare brake pads available in-store, ref. 8110638). To make your wheels last longer, swap them into different positions to even out the wear.
The boot can be machine washed at 30°C..

O produto é forte, deve ser administrado com cuidado e gradativamente, conforme a bula ou ainda mais brandamente. Junto com alimentação adequada e aeróbico, os resultados são ótimos. Sem falar na energia que proporciona, nos primeiros dias das doses mais altas dá até barato... Logo, tudo que excita, deprime, por isso deve ser deixado longe das pessoas que sofrem depressão ou algo similar, conforme indica a bula.

This product didn't work for me and scared me a little. I have taken thermogenics in the past but none have given me side effects but this one. As soon as I upped my dose to the two capsules a day - I felt like I was on speed. My heart was RACING. And i could feel it, which caused me to want to panic a bit. I was antsy, couldn't breathe well and just didn't feel right. I pushed through a workout but felt terrible the entire time. After my workout I came completely down. Rock bottom. I was exhausted. Two days after my last dose (because i didn't take anymore, I won't even risk going back to one a day) I got a rash all over my chest, arms and back. I didn't combine this with anything other than a multivitamin. Just be careful what you put in your body and pay attention to how it reacts with new products.

AwesomeiPhones aren’t just for geeks and techy people, they are for everyone. As a matter of fact, if you look at this chart, you’ll see that from 2007 when the first iPhone was introduced all the way through the end of last quarter (March 31, 2011), there have been about 108,624,000 iPhones sold. That’s a lot of iPhones!
We’ve featured many unique iPhone cases here on Bit Rebels, and most of the time they are the slickest, geekiest, most sophisticated ones out there. We’ve also written about some wacky ones, like this case made out of plants, this one that looks like you could eat it, and this one that stores your emergency condom.
However, what if you don’t want anything flashy or geeky? What if you enjoy crafts and want something custom made? NeoStitch has the solution for you. They’ve created a DIY cross-stitch kit so you can make your own iPhone case. It’s available in 6 different colors. Each kit comes with 2 needles, thread and patterns to follow. You don’t have to use a pattern though, you can let your imagination run wild and create your own! I don’t even like to sew, but this still looks like fun to me. You can pick one up at Connect Design for $18.
Do they make one for other phones? Like Samsung Galaxy S4 or S5?Free windows

Reviews
There are no reviews yet.By Holly Scheer
I share something in common with many of you– the church I attend now is not the church I grew up in. Our society is increasingly mobile.
We move for jobs, for college, when we get married. Sometimes we move so far away that going “home” is hard.
And for those of us reared in the church this means that not only are we apart from childhood friends and family we are apart from the church of our youth.
New churches come with new experiences. New meals at potlucks, new holiday traditions. New hymns the congregation prefers.
I grew up with the liturgy. I can close my eyes and say it by heart. It runs through my mind during the day and when I’m going to sleep.
My childhood church was different than the beloved one I attend now– but the liturgy remains the same.
When I am at the rail for communion I remember that not only am I communing with the dear saints next to me kneeling– but all the hosts of Heaven.
We are a true family, the family of believers. A new church brings new traditions, but the things we share unify us. They keep us close together.
There is so much beauty in the shared songs and patterns of the church– what it teaches us as small children and reminds us of when we are old. The deep gifts of our Lord, given freely and generously to us.
There are things and people I miss from my church I grew up in, but I take comfort in the promise of the Resurrection and the knowledge that missing things is a concern of this world.Ginger Rogers and Bread Astaire, the Gingerbread Cookies

Spirituality and Politics.
In: Woods, Richard, Tyler, Peter, (eds.)
Bloomsbury Guide to Christian Spirituality.
London: Bloomsbury Press, pp. 187-199.
[Book section]
The chapter explores the relationship between spirituality and politics, using one author from antiquity (Augustine) and one from the modern era (Johann Baptist Metz). The themes of political idolatry and the vulnerability of the subject are seen to be related by both authors as causes of political messianism. A further connection with spirituality is explored in Metz's relation with Karl Rahner, as these authors two contrasting 'moments' in the Ignatian Spiritual Exercises (Ashley).by Leon Sievers,
Professional Land Surveyor with the Weld County Public Works Dept.
In 1785, Congress enacted a law stating that the land in the new states was to be surveyed by a grid system consisting of townships 6 miles square and the said townships were to start at a principal meridian and its base line. These initial points were established as needed across the country.
The Kansas-Nebraska Act of May 30, 1854 created the Territories of Nebraska and Kansas, which had to be surveyed before settlement of the prairies could proceed.
On May 8, 1855, Charles A. Manners set a monument made of cast iron on the
bluff west of the Missouri River at 40° north latitude. In 1855-56 Manners surveyed 108 miles westward from this cast iron monument establishing the base line, the boundary between Kansas and Nebraska and established the Initial Point of the Sixth Principal Meridian.
The monument has the words Colorado on its west face, Kansas on the south face and Nebraska on its north face. This baseline continues westerly from the initial point and terminates at the summit of the Rocky Mountains, approximately 21 miles west of Boulder. The baseline is the longest baseline in the Centennial United States.
Why is the line between Kansas and Nebraska important to Weld County? That line, the 40° north latitude line, happens to be the southerly boundary of Weld County. All subsequent east-west township lines were surveyed to be parallel to
this baseline. The map to the right illustrates the vast area that is controlled by the baseline and the Sixth Principal Meridian.
The Sixth Principal Meridian starts at the initial point and runs in a true north-south direction. The northern terminus was on the southerly bank of the Missouri River. Thanks to the movement of the river, this point is now in the Missouri River. The southern terminus is the south line of the state of Kansas. All north-south township lines run in a true north to south direction. They are not parallel to the Sixth Principal Meridian line due to the fact that they converge at the north pole. This creates the difficultly in surveying and laying out square sections on a sphere. The problem was minimized by making corrections on the east-west township lines at 24 mile intervals north of the baseline. Anyone traveling north or south should notice the ‘jog’ in the road at the baseline, which is Weld County Road (WCR) 2, and the correction lines of WCR 50 and WCR 98. The ‘jogs’ are a result of the correction in section lines that helped to compensate for the “square on a sphere” problem. Other lines were surveyed to help control the location of the township lines. These lines were run true north and south and were called Guide Meridians. The correction lines mentioned above were also known as Standard Parallels as they were parallel to the baseline.
Township Lines were set six miles apart from each other going north and south from the 40th Parallel North and Range Lines were set six miles apart west of the Sixth Principal Meridian. The townships were numbered, starting with one for the first six mile increment, two for the second and so forth, giving each township a number subscript. The first township is called Township One North, the second Township Two North, etc. The Range Lines were numbered from the Sixth Principal Meridian (P.M.) going West again, in six mile increments. The first Range West of the 6th P. M. is called Range One West, the second Range Two West and so forth.
Once the Township Lines and Range Lines were in place, the surveyors started subdividing these areas into one mile rectangular parcels known as sections. They would start at the southeast corner of the Township, go west one mile, then north six miles, marking each "half-mile" and "mile" corner. At each mile or section corner, they would survey to the east and connect to the section corner already in place and make any corrections needed for alignment. This continued from east to west across the township.
Monuments were placed every half mile and described in the surveyor’s notebook so that later surveyors could identify that marker as genuine. The picture on the
left is a section corner stone that was recently recovered while surveying near the town of Grover.
The stone is shown on its side, but when originally placed it would have been upright. Marks were originally placed on the stone to indicate the number of miles west and north of the southeast township corner. You can faintly see the marks on this stone which was originally set in 1869. If stones were not readily available, surveyors would remove sod from approximately a 2’ by 4’ area in all four directions from the corner and stack this sod where the section corner would be. Next, they drove a wooden stake through the sod. The stake was marked with lines like the stone. This type of monument was called a “pit and mound”. Stones were permanently set and not easily removed, however the pits and mounds were easily destroyed. Prairie fires burned the stakes and stampeding buffalo obliterated the mounts. By in large, the location of the original markers are still used today as the original location of the section corners, even if there is reason to question the accuracy of how they were set.
It’s important to remember what it would be like to be an original surveyor in this area. The surveys of Weld County took place in the 1860’s. The Civil War was raging, Wyatt Erp was only twelve years old. The Native American and the Settlers were hostile to each other. The Sand Creek Massacre happened in this time period. The wild, wild west was not yet in full swing but gun slingers were present. Railroads were beginning to appear. Gold was discovered in the area called Auraria and in the mountains and once the land was surveyed, settlers came to homestead and populate Weld County.
Surveyors measured the land by using a 66’ long Gunthers Chain as seen in the picture below.
The direction of their travel was determined by a compass, as seen in the picture below.
Crews were made up of 5 to 7 men. These men worked from sunrise to sunset and lived in camp sites. Life was not easy for the early surveyors. Food was shot along the way. Work proceeded summer and winter. They were outside and faced the elements every day. Reports were sent back to the Surveyor Generals office of Native Americans discharging their weapons at them and disrupting their camps with midnight raids. Many workers feared for their lives. The crews would survey and walk more than 10 miles per day. Surveying time was much longer and more difficult when surveying in the townships around the major rivers in the county. Surveyors were required to describe the vegetation encountered and they were required to rate the soil and state an opinion on the ability to use this land for farming. These records were to be used by people wanting to move to Weld County and homestead. However, the records may not have been as accurate as hoped because it seems surveyors were not as good at rating soil as they were in surveying..
The early surveyors completed one heck of a task with what today would be considered very primitive equipment. With our present day equipment, one person can measure to a small fraction of an inch and many miles in a very short time. I think if we were forced to survey today with the equipment and burdens they had back then, I doubt we could do the job nearly as good as they did. There are many adventurous and hardworking people that can be found in the early years of Weld County and certainly the original surveyors should be listed among them. They truly helped “form” and “shape” the county.

Back in March, I went to my first lymphoma conference. It was a good conference, all things considered, and I sat in on an interesting talk about the history and current state of lymphoma. I thought it might make for good viewing beyond the conference.
Since Dr. LaCasce gave the talk, and since she's both my medical oncologist and Dana-Farber faculty, I asked her if we could put it up on Dana-Farber's Slideshare page. She agreed. If you haven't used Slideshare before, it's a social media site for presentations. You can view presentations, or in some cases, like this one, listen and view simultaneously. (I'd recommend using Internet Explorer or Safari, though. It's not always smooth sailing on Chrome or Firefox, nor is it great on mobile platforms.)
Anyway, it's about a 30-minute talk and it's interesting, particularly if you have an interest in lymphoma. If you want the shorter summary, you can find that on the Dana-Farber blog.

This fall, we took the plane to China, in order to reach Getu He valley. Some people had already done rock climbing there before but Petzl team bolted many new routes for its climbing event in 2011, Petzl Rock Trip. Since there, we thought it could be interesting to go there for a climbing trip. On top af that, it would be for sure a very exotic destination for us, lost in China and very far from France!
And as soon as we arrived in Guiyang airport (Guiyang airport: 贵阳), which is the closer to Getu He, we just were on another planet. Everything here is so different. You can see people dancing in the street at any hour. Others are playing diabolo and you can see funny means of transport like this special bike used to carry vegetables. There’s also an incredible difference between very fashionable shops and traditionnal ones.
Something important you have to know arriving here is that almost nobody can speak english. This means that you need a good preparation in order to arrive where you want. It s impossible for us to read chinese indications and renting a car is a very bad idea. That’s why it’s very important to print on papers the names in chinese of the places you want to go to. Taxi drivers are very busy people and you’ll have to show them very quickly the adress of the hotel if you have to spend a night in Guiyang, which is almost inevitable as you have to give your arriving adress in China to have your visa!
Most of the taxi drivers don’t like to get out of Guiyang city, so the easier to reach Getu He is to go to Jinyang bus station (金阳客运站). From there you’ll take a comfortable bus to Ziyun ( 紫云). It’s about 2 hours. It seems there are only two bus each day and the last one left Jinyang at 13h00 during our trip.
From Ziyun, a small bus takes you to Getu in 45 minutes. Last bus from Zinyun to Getu He ( 格凸河) at 17h30 during our trip.
Gigantic Jinyang bus station where the game consists in geting inside the good bus!
On the road to Getu, The landscape becomes very different from Guiyang’s one, with small villages lost in the fields and these very special green chinese mountains.
The entrance of Getu valley, china
A village in getu valley
We decided to stay at the guest house which is on the left at the entrance of Getu village, with many Petzl posters. There are two hotels a bit further but the guest house has the best food (to eat with chopsticks !) of the valley and it’s very cheap with a good comfort (60 yuans per person for night, dinner and noodles for breakfast). We didn’t book anything before arriving. Anyway, the very friendly family doesn’t speak english, so it would have been complicated to do it!
You can find small stores in the village where you can buy a few things but if you need coffee, fresh fruits or any other special food, you’ll have to go to Ziyun.
You needn’t any car to go climbing and the further cliff is Fish Crag that you can reach in a 45 minutes walk. There’s a lot of choice in grade 6 or 7. Strong climbers doing grade 8 would have quite few routes to do though these are very nice. There are also less routes in grade 5. The weather is rather wet but many cliffs are protected from the rain. Just take some dry clothes to change once you will be under a cave! It’s a bit more complicated to find grade 5 routes for the rainy days…
At the entrance of the valley, you can find very nice routes in grade 6 or 7. Fish Crag offers steep technical walls while Oliver’s Crag, Rastaman and Wawan’s Crag are quite overhanging.
Fish crag and its beatifull wall.
The nice 5c+ of Rastaman crag
Florence, climbing Zion, 6c+ at Rastaman crag
Roman, climbing the amazing 7a+ of Wawan’s cave.
In the same area, you can find easier routes in White Crag, Left of Red and CMDI wall, which one is also a very good cliff for multipich routes. You can also find a long route in Pussa Yan with a complicated descent and some easy routes at the bottom.
A bit closer to the village, you can go to Banyang’s Cave which is probably the best sector for hard routes at that time. You’ll have long routes in 7c on tufa climbing on the left side and nice stamina routes in 8a/8b on the right wall.
Flo climbs the long routes with tufa on the left of Banyang cave. (Photo: Roman Bayon)
Guillaume climbs right wall’s routes… (photo: Roman Bayon)
… which are sometimes very physical! (Photo: Roman Bayon)
In front of the guest house, the Lazy Dragon sector has some nice routes. You have to cross the river that goes inside the cave to reach the routes on right side which are rather dirty for the moment as few people climbed there.
On the paths to go to the cliffs, you’ll see many fields and the inhabitants spend most of their time working outside to produce vegetables and rice, sometimes with incredibly old techniques! It’s just like travelling throughout the ages. It’s also a big surprise to see some of them get the last generation of smartphone out of their pocket to phone a friend while working!
Although they are very poor, people are very friendly and many invited us to eat something while we were walking in the country. Tourism is rather new here and people are curious about europeans. Pyrotechnics and firecrackers are very popular and you sometimes will have the impression of beeing in the middle of the war.
If you go in the opposite direction, you ‘ll find the two great arches that made all the fame of climbing in Getu. This is a national parc and you’ll have to pay either for a six days pass or for a one day ticket. We were very impatient to see these gigantic caves!
Chuanshang Cave, the great arch of Getu valley
We didn’t climbed on the lower arch where there are only multipitch routes with the famous « Voie du milieu » in 8b+, to hard for us!
To reach Chuanshang Cave, the main sector, you’ll have to take a ferry boat. Take care that the ferry service is no longer available after 18h00!
Food on getu river side, china
While waiting the boat, you can try local food with fried potatoes, fishes or meat!
The ferry to go to the main arch of Getu
You’ll have to climb the 1500 stairs before climbing in Chuanshang Cave. Perfect for warming up!
The steps to reach Chuanshang Cave
Easy climbing in Chuanshang Cave, the great arch of Getu valley
You ll find very original routes with strange pockets in this arch. Most of the holds are undercling in these routes and this makes the climbing very technical and physical in the same time. As it’s white rock (as often on shadow cliffs) and rather new, the friction isn’t very good. All the routes are protected from rain and you’ll find grades from 6a to 9a.
Flo climbs Dunman, beautifull 7a + in Chuanshang Cave.
Having a good rest before the hard section of Autochtono, 7c+.
When we were in Getu, chinese had started big works in the arch. As a consequence, it was very noisy and it was impossible to climb some of the routes because of the installations on the ground…
On the path to the great arch, you can go on the left to reach Flag Cliff’s routes, very nice but almost never climbed or Buddha Cave with amazing hard routes in grade 7 or 8.
Roman is having fun in the amazing routes of Buddha cave.
After climbing in the Great Arch, although the routes on pockets are very beautifull, we had clearly the impression that doing the incredible multipitch routes in this big roof was the best climbing here. There are many 200 m routes here, from 6c+ to 8c+ for the incredible « Corazon de Ensueno » de Dani Andrada.
That’s why I came back a few days later with my friend Guillaume to climb « Lost in Translation ». This route has a bright itinerary and was equiped by Stephanie Bodet and Arnaud Petit. It’s absolutely incredible and we were really happy to have big fights in such a big roof!
The first pitch of Lost in Translation. There’s still a lot to do!
Climbing is very physical, so it’s very important to find tricky rests.
Guillaume in the crux of Lost in translation, the third pitch in 8a.
The incredible roof.
It seems the route had some special effects on Guillaume’s health…
Guillaume went back in the cave two days later with Roman to do Nihao Wokepa which is also an amazing route!
More informations:
Health: hepatitis A and B, dTP and typhoid. Apparently, no big problem of malaria near Getu but close regions require more precautions, especially in rainy season. Take Micropure pastilles to prepare the water which is not drinkable, a good first-aid kit for the small cuts and other disorders. The food is quite spiced and gastric disorders are possible.
Administrative: valid passport with two consecutive free pages and compulsory visa. For the visa, it is necessary to supply a whole list of documents and to prepare everything at the latest one month in advance.
Season: we were in Getu in October-November and the climate was very pleasant.
Currency: 1 euro is approximately 8 yuans. Difficult (impossible?) to have yuans before your departure. Best is to withdraw money with your credit card arriving at the airport in China. Take care of swindles in some small exchange offices. Life in town is much more expensive than in countryside. For information, we needed 300 euros to spend 3 weeks in China.
Plane: the plane ticket Nice-Guiyang is around 900 euros. Approximately 25 hours are needed with long enough stopovers in oder to have fewer chances to lose your luggage. If they happen to be lost, it seems better to wait for its in Guiyang than in Getu!
Mind you: it is good to have your sleeping bag with you and an additional mattress ( beds are quite hard) for more comfort even if there are covers in the guest house. The mobile phone works well in Getu. WiFi and electricity in the guest house (plan an adapter).
Guidebook: for the moment, the most complete one is supplied by Petzl, you can find it here.
And for those who would like to go in Getu He, you will find more informations on Petzl website, or on El Potrero Chico website with this article..Takeaway Restaurant Vegetarian South West Agent SBX Code Number SV1092 Restaurant takeaway preparing and serving fresh vegetarian meals soft and cold drinks Also

Posted By: Carol <Pinocckio@aol.com> (cache-ntc-ab09.proxy.aol.com)
Date: 5/9/3 15:55
An beautiful antique sofa with hand carving has been in my family for ages. The problem is that people almost never sit in it because it is so uncomfortable (the seat and back are so hard).
I don't care about ruining the antique $ value. I would rather have my family want to keep and use it. That's why I've decided to reupholster it.
I've taken photos of the sofa to be able to reconstruct it so that it looks similar. I'm working my way into the seat to see how it was constructed -- it looks like horsehair, matted cotton, etc.
I've seen messages on this bulletin board about sinuous and coil springs. I've read that sinuous springs are good when you want to keep a low profile. That would be necessary if I place foam above them - for comfort. In fact, I'm thinking of using this same approach (with thinner foam) on the back.
Please let me know if you think I'm on the right track. Thanks!

29/03/2016 - 8.15AM
At 8.15am on Tuesday (29) one crew from Huntingdon and one crew from Stanground were called to a fire on Ring Road in Huntingdon.
Firefighters arrived to find a fire in the chimney of the Old Bridge Hotel. Using the Multistar 1+ they extinguished the fire using a hose reel. The bridge connecting Huntingdon and Godmanchester was closed while the crews extinguished the fire.

Labels: AccountabiliBuddy, pease puddin'Editor plugins in UE4 2# – A few tips
There are few tips I’d like to share with you before you start coding. Some of them are obvious, some a bit less, but I thought it’s worth mentioning.
UI extension points
If you are going to extend the editor, you will need to know where to place the button/menu/widget. For that reason, UE4 uses extension points (Extension hooks). They serve as a way to identify a certain place in UI. There is a way to display them, so you can easily find out, where to place your custom UI. Go to Edit/Editor Preferences and under General/Miscellaneous check Display UIExtension Points.
You will see the effect on newly created menus, but I recommend restarting editor, so it takes effect across the whole editor. The extension points will be displayed in green text.
Widget Reflector
If you need to know, how certain UI element (menu, window, button) was created, you can use Widget Reflector. You can find it in Window/Developer Tools/ Widget Reflector. The easiest way to use it is to click on Pick Live Widget. This will allow you to pick a widget by simply hovering over it. You can end picking by pressing ESC key. In the Widget reflector, you will be able to see all the layers, that makes selected UI element.
Documentation
Documentation is your friend. That obviously applies to gameplay programming as well, but in this case, it is even more important. Unlike gameplay programming, there aren’t that many tutorials on plugin development and if you ask a question on Answerhub, chances are, that it will remain unanswered forever. So you will probably have to figure out most of the problems yourself, and documentation is one way to make this process a little bit easier.
There is also one quite important piece of information at every docs page. Right at the bottom of a docs page, you can see the header file, that needs to be included to use a specific class and a module, to which this class belongs. This is important because you need to add this module to your Build.cs file in order to use the header file.
Source code
Another way, to learn new thing as far as extending editor goes, is to explore the engine source code. It can be pretty daunting at first, but once you get the hang of it, you can find pretty much anything you can imagine there. Most of the stuff I learned was from exploring the source code and testing my findings inside my plugin code. I thought I’m going to give you few tips, where to find useful info.
A good start would be to check out PluginBrowser plugin. You can find it in Plugins/Editor/PluginBrowser . It has enough elements, that you can learn a lot from it, but it is not too complicated. SFilePathBlock is a good example of a custom widget. It is also nicely commented and you can easily compare the code to the result (it is the path and name part of the plugin wizard).
For more complex stuff, go check out Paper2D. Under Plugins/2D/Paper2D/Paper2DEditor you can find a lot of information. I recommend checking out ContentBrowserExtension and LevelEditorMenuExtensions to see, how they did menu extension in different parts of the editor. You can also check out, how they build whole custom editors for sprites, flipbooks, tilesets, and tilemaps.
Another good resource for learning slate code is in Source/Runtime/AppFramework and then Framework/Testing. Lots of slate code to check out.
Last recommendation from me would be Source/Editor/Kismet and Source/Editor/BlueprintGraph. That’s where BP editor and K2 nodes are. Great stuff, if you want to start messing with BP editor or create custom nodes (K2 nodes will be covered in a future tutorial).ALSO READKatrina shares glimpses from 'Jagga Jasoos' sets Can't blame them: Anurag Basu on Indian audience's shifting interests Jagga Jassos is for children, says Anurag Basu Gujarat to promote film tourism at 2016 NFDC's Film Bazaar Every moment of being Jhilmil was pure joy: PeeCee celebrates four years of 'Barfi!'

Through a unique approach of defining the bus system as a whole, rather than looking just at the vehicle, the European Bus System of the Future (EBSF) set out to achieve major advances in the design of not only vehicles, but also infrastructure and operations.
EBSF innovations in IT systems, vehicle design, driver cabins and bus stations were put to the test in real operational scenarios in eight European cities: Bremerhaven, Brunoy, Budapest, Gothenburg, Madrid, Paris, Rome and Rouen, achieving key results in an IT standard architecture, capacity and modularity, and passenger flow, for example.
"The sheer scale and ambition of EBSF make it unique in the bus sector and even the whole public transport domain and has been a great success on many different levels," explained UITP secretary general, Alain Flausch. "Bringing together so many manufacturers and industry partners led to the creation of a variety of innovative solutions and an overall strengthening of the competitive position of European bus manufacturers".
Chris Brown was arrested Tuesday afternoon on felony assault charges.
A spokesperson with the LAPD told Variety the singer was arrested and formally charged for assault with a deadly weapon following an incident early Tuesday morning.
Police responded to a call at about 3 a.m. on Tuesday, in which a woman said Brown threatened her with a gun during an altercation. After a police report was filed, cops obtained a search warrant for his Tarzana, Calif., property.
Brown initially refused to leave his home for the police investigation, resulting in an hours-long standoff. His attorney, Mark Geragos, arrived at Brown’s home shortly after the warrant was issued. At one point, Brown threw a bag out of his window that contained guns and drugs, according to TMZ, which first broke the news of his arrest.
As news broke on Tuesday, Brown posted a series of videos on Instagram declaring his innocence. He called the police “idiots” and went on to say, “I’m innocent f— everybody I’m tired of hearing this s—.”
“When you get the warrant or whatever you need to do, you’re going to walk right up in here and you’re going to see nothing. You idiots,” he said.
It’s only the latest in Brown’s legal trouble.

ABOUT THE PRODUCTION
SHUFFLE UP AND DEAL
"Lucky You," the new romantic drama from writer/director/producer Curtis Hanson, is set in the world of high-stakes poker in Las Vegas in 2003. A longtime poker player himself, Hanson offers, "I wanted to do a relationship story set in the world of poker because I've always been fascinated by the fact that the skills one must develop to be a good poker player are almost the exact opposite of the skills needed to be successful in a relationship.."
Screenwriter Eric Roth actually began writing the original script for "Lucky You" before the spike in poker's popularity. "I wanted to create something different about gamblers and gambling because I think all great gambling movies are love stories at heart, about winning and losing and finding your way," he says.
Hanson adds, "We set the story in 2003 because that was the year the world of poker dramatically changed. Three things came together to make that happen. Internet poker was exploding, allowing amateur players from all over the world to hone their card skills online. The hole card camera was introduced that year, which made the game much more popular on television because it allowed the audience at home to see the players' hole cards and learn about the nuances of betting and bluffing from the top pros. And it was the year an unknown amateur internet player named Chris Moneymaker won the World Series of Poker, making it possible for everyone to say, `That could be me.'"
Hanson and Roth collaborated on a final script even as the fast-growing poker craze was bringing a new dimension to the story of a dynamic young poker pro named Huck; his estranged father, legendary poker champion L.C. Cheever; and an aspiring singer named Billie, who comes into Huck's life and becomes, at once, his muse and his conscience.
Producer Carol Fenelon remarks, "I think Curtis believes the ability to distinguish truth from artifice is an important element of any relationship. In many ways, the world of professional poker in Las Vegas provided the perfect opportunity to explore that idea. Poker can only truly be mastered by those who excel at discerning the difference between honesty and deception. The ability to read people-to understand their `tells' and then act on that knowledge to one's personal advantage-is perhaps the biggest key to conquering the game."
Producer Denise Di Novi notes that the poker boom coming when it did was "a nice coincidence because more people are playing and watching poker and understanding the game. Poker really is used as a kind of metaphor for how the characters lead their lives and deal with their relationships, so the more people understand poker, the more meaningful that aspect of the story is to them and the more they can get out of the movie. It's about the game of life and how you play it to get the most out of it. How much risk do you take and how much do you open up?"
FACE CARDS
Eric Bana was cast in the central role of audacious poker player Huck Cheever, and Curtis Hanson says that the actor came with an uncompromising approach to his work that made him perfect for the role. "Like Huck, Eric Bana is a blaster; he came at his part full out. During the rehearsal period, he not only worked on his scenes but immersed himself in learning the game of poker. He is a true chameleon. Unlike many actors who twist characters to fit their own personalities and characteristics, I think Eric looks at each part as an opportunity to truly become someone else."
In becoming Huck Cheever, Bana says that he developed an insight into what drives his character. "I think Huck has competitive juices flying through his system so the world of poker really suits his personality and his lifestyle. He enjoys it; it gives him a sense of purpose, but he's so immersed in that world that, really, nothing else exists for him. I think other people believe he could be one of the great poker players if he could keep his head together, but I'm not sure he knows himself what his true potential is. In a way, he was born to be a poker player, but he needs to sort out other elements in his life if he is going to take his game to the next level."
Huck's innate ability at the poker table and his seeming inability to reach his potential can both be traced back to one "element" in his life: his strained relationship with his father, L.C. Cheever, a maverick poker player in whose shadow Huck has always lived and played. "Huck is haunted by his father's reputation in the poker world," Bana comments. "We see his behavior change when L.C. is around. He's a much more secure player when his father is not around and becomes a little hotheaded when L.C. is present. It definitely has an effect on him."
In what the filmmakers agree was something of a casting coup, Academy Award winner Robert Duvall stars in the role of L.C. Cheever. "We wanted L.C. to be an almost iconic figure, so the choice of Robert Duvall to bring him to life was an easy one," states Hanson. "He brought all of his creative power to the role, beautifully establishing the essence of the man-fiercely competitive, tough and intimidating, both as a father and as a player."
Duvall is only half joking when he says that he didn't know the difference between a flush and a straight when he was approached to play the role of a great poker champion. "I really didn't know if I could do this part because there was so much to learn. But it was a very sophisticated script-very smart and very accurate-and Curtis is a talented director, so I thought it would be interesting. I wish I could have gotten the script six months earlier, though, because I almost had to decode it, but I did my research and now I understand the game...somewhat."
Duvall, however, needed no help understanding the dynamic between L.C. and Huck, saying, "A lot of animosity has built up between them, especially on Huck's part because of certain things that have happened in the past. But L.C. hasn't given up on them at all; throughout the movie he tries to reach out to Huck."
Denise Di Novi notes, "The father-son relationship was always important to the story, but once Robert Duvall was cast, it became even more meaningful because he's such a brilliant actor and added so much dimension to it. To me, that aspect of the story is something every adult can relate to, because it's about how you can't really move on with your life and have a successful relationship until you deal with the baggage that you carry from your parents, which we all must do."
Seeming to bear out that theory, Huck's romantic entanglements have been limited to brief flirtations and casual affairs with no promise, or even hope, of any long-term commitments. However, all that seems about to change with the arrival of an aspiring young singer named Billie Offer.
Drew Barrymore, who stars as Billie, observes, "She is so different from the people in Vegas who are willing to risk it all. Billie is very much a person with traditional values who believes you have to work hard to make it. But she thinks Las Vegas is the place for her because it's where she can finally try to do the thing her heart wants most, which is to sing. When I read the script, I immediately liked her honesty and her humility and the way she sees the world. She is idealistic but also very grounded, especially in a town that is way up in the clouds."
Nevertheless, Barrymore admits that one aspect of the role gave her pause. "I had to sing in this movie, which terrified me, but Curtis asked me to train as hard as I could so it could be me up there singing. Just the fact that he had that kind of faith in me meant the world to me, so I told him I would do whatever it took."
And she did, Hanson attests. "She worked very hard, and I just love her for that. Beyond that, Drew projects a unique combination of innocence and wisdom that I thought would be perfect for the role of Billie. Like Huck, Billie is especially adept at reading people, but instead of using what she learns to defeat them, she sees their emotional truth with an open and supportive heart."
Perhaps a little too open when it comes to Huck, Barrymore acknowledges. "Billie has been very reliable and old-fashioned in a sense, but the thing she's been the most frivolous with is her heart. She really intends to be careful from now on and try and find the right person, someone who is not going to hurt her. Then, of course, she meets Huck, who is a classic heartbreaker. I think she might sense that, but because of the small-town world she comes from, she has a certain lack of judgment about him. But when he crosses the line, she will not be `bluffed' or charmed like the other women in his life. She becomes an example to him of how to be honest and true to yourself, whether the stakes are small or high...whether they are personal or professional."
"Huck sees something in Billie that he hasn't seen before in other women," Bana agrees. "I think that's why he ultimately lowers his guard with her, which allows him to experience the first true relationship he's probably ever known."
Billie's older sister, Suzanne, an old acquaintance of Huck's, warns Billie not to succumb to Huck's womanizing charms. But as Billie and Huck's relationship progresses, Suzanne begins to let go of her concerns. Suzanne is played by Debra Messing, who affirms, "I think Suzanne sees that Billie has gotten to Huck, and there might actually be hope for something real for him. Curtis and I talked a lot about the differences between the two sisters. Billie is a romantic; she sees everything with hope and optimism, whereas Suzanne is a little more world-weary and a realist."
Barrymore agrees. "I think Billie is definitely an optimist. She knows that heartbreak is inevitable in life-she's experienced it before and may again. But she sees something in Huck that makes her willing to risk her heart again."
THE REEL DEAL
"Lucky You" is the first Hollywood film to be set against the excitement and drama of the recent worldwide poker phenomenon, and the filmmakers went to great lengths to accurately represent the world of high-stakes cash games and tournament play in Las Vegas, circa 2003. For assistance, they turned first to poker legend Doyle "Texas Dolly" Brunson. In addition to serving as the film's poker consultant, Brunson was in a position to have a special insight into the central characters of "Lucky You." Like Robert Duvall's character, L.C. Cheever, Brunson is a two-time World Series of Poker Champion and is considered an icon in the world of poker. And, like L.C., Brunson also has a son, Todd Brunson, who has followed in his father's footsteps and will forever be faced with the legacy of his more-famous father.
Matt Savage, who has been a tournament director for some of the biggest events in poker, served as the film's tournament consultant, and professional poker player Jason Lester, who finished fourth in the WSOP Main Event in 2003, acted as a consultant for the scenes involving the film's climactic Main Event championship. Brunson, Savage and Lester also make cameo appearances in the movie.
The first order of business was to teach Bana and Duvall how to play poker like seasoned pros. "Robert Duvall and Eric Bana trained for months in order to play side-by-side with the poker professionals who appear in the film. Their goal was not to become expert players, per se, but to be able to sit at the table and handle their cards and their chips like the experts," explains Hanson. "Robert also had the privilege of spending a considerable amount of time with Doyle Brunson. And while his character is not based on Doyle, it was certainly informed by Robert's experiences with him."
While hanging out with Brunson, Duvall discovered that, in the poker world, the definition of a celebrity is quite different. "I went down with Doyle to the casino in Commerce, California, and almost nobody came up to me at all. I don't even know if they recognized me. He was definitely the star when we walked in there."
Eric Bana also benefited from time spent with some real-life poker pros, both on and off the set. "It lifted our game because it's impossible for it not to rub off," the actor says. "For instance, a scene that might only be a minute onscreen could take us days to shoot, so that's hours and hours sitting around with these guys, and all you're doing between takes is talking poker. It definitely elevated my ability to sell my character as someone who knows his way around a poker table."
"With millions of people watching poker on television, it was vital to maintain the authenticity of not only the game but its players," states Hanson. To that end, Brunson, Lester and Savage were joined onscreen by some of today's most recognizable poker pros: Jack Binion, Johnny Chan, Hoyt Corkins, Antonio Esfandiari, Sam Farha, Chris Ferguson, Ted Forrest, Phil Hellmuth, Chau Giang, Barry Greenstein, Dan Harrington, Karina Jett, John Juanda, Erick Lindgren, Minh Ly, Mike Matusow, Daniel Negreanu, Erik Seidel, Mimi Tran, Cyndy Violette, Marsha Waggoner and Robert Williamson III.
"It was very important that we surround the actors with people who really know how to play the game, how to handle their chips, and how to bet," Hanson asserts. "To me, that was more important than having people who could just deliver the lines. Poker is very much a game of looks and attitude."
In fact, apart from Eric Bana and Robert Duvall, one of the only Hollywood actors with a major role at the poker table is Emmy winner Jean Smart in the role of Michelle Lewis. Smart's character was inspired by one of poker's most successful female professionals, Jennifer Harman, while Harman herself appears in the film as a fictional player named Shannon Kincaid. Poker pros John Hennigan and David Oppenheim also portray fictional characters in the movie.
Sam Farha comments that the pros were impressed with the director's commitment to accuracy. "He would ask us, `Is that how you'd play it? Is this how the betting would go?' He wanted us to give our opinions. I think he did a great job."
Hanson valued the guidance of all the players, but none more so than Doyle Brunson. "We wanted the poker in the movie to be valid, so we based every hand of cards on a real hand, either from tournament play or an observed cash game," the director offers. "We were lucky enough to enlist Doyle early on as our poker consultant. I went over every hand with him-the sequence of the cards and the betting-taking his advice and making adjustments. Doyle, of course, knows better than anyone that there are no hard and fast rules of play: players make unpredictable moves and luck is definitely part of the game. That's why poker is endlessly fascinating."
Throughout the production, the presence of the real poker players was invaluable to the filmmakers, who went to great lengths to accurately represent not only the world of tournament play but the less public high-stakes cash games in Las Vegas. No detail was overlooked; even the dealers at the tables were all longtime poker dealers who were recruited for the film from local casinos during filming in Las Vegas.
The numerous poker scenes in the film are not restricted to the No Limit Hold `Em tournaments with which television audiences are very familiar. They encompass both cash games and tournament play and include a mix of different poker games with varying levels of stakes. At the Bellagio, we see Huck "playing with the guppies" to build up his bankroll before he eventually moves up to the "Big Game," where he plays with the game's top pros.
Carol Fenelon remarks, "Most outsiders don't know about the Big Game, but it is legendary in Las Vegas, and we went to some trouble to create a fictional but authentic version of it in the film. The `Big Game' is a mixed game where the type of poker being played changes every half hour or so, unlike regular casino tables where one particular version of poker is played continuously. It is the pantheon of cash games where the biggest action and the best players are. The `Big Game' is where Huck's father plays whenever he's in town, and Huck wants to prove he can compete at that level and win."
"There's a big difference between tournament play and the high-stakes games," Jason Lester explains, adding that there is also a difference between playing and filming a poker tournament. "A poker tournament can go ten hours or more a day, but we play different hands. We don't play the same hand for ten hours over and over," he laughs.
"Filming the poker scenes was a challenge," says Hanson, who teamed with cinematographer Peter Deming to capture all the action. "How do you film them in a way that makes it interesting? How do you differentiate one game dramatically from another? How do you make it special for audiences who are now used to watching poker on television? On television, the pocket camera allows the viewer to see the hole cards of all the players. Being ahead of the players is entertaining, but, of course, it's not what playing the game is actually like. Additionally, when telling a story, I want the audience to identify with one character as much as possible. Consequently, we shot all the poker scenes from Huck's point of view; we see only his hole cards and we watch him trying to figure out what the other players have. This invites the audience to think along with Huck and will hopefully help them to identify with him, too."
To anyone who watches poker, the seemingly unconscious habit of shuffling stacks of chips is a definite indicator of long hours spent honing one's skill in live games. It seemed appropriate to Bana and the filmmakers that Huck would have such a tic. While on location in Las Vegas, Bana, Hanson and Fenelon spent an afternoon at the home of one of the game's best chip handlers, Antonio Esfandiari. Esfandiari taught Bana a three-chip hand manipulation that the actor can be seen using throughout the movie.
Apart from cards and chips, the role of Huck Cheever required that Bana also master a completely different skill set. "Eric not only had to learn to play poker, he also had to train to hit a golf ball like a player with a four handicap," Hanson offers, referring to a pivotal sequence in which Huck is forced to take on a physically demanding bet. "He did that very well, too. Every golf shot in the movie is his."
But only after hours spent on the links of Australia, Los Angeles and Las Vegas, Bana concedes. "For me, the golf was the most daunting part of the making the film, because I'd played very, very little golf, and my game had usually been of great comedic value to my friends. You could have nicknamed me `The Slicer.' But Curtis was very strict about it. He said, `You have to swing like you have a four handicap, so get to work.' So I did, and it really paid off. I don't know how many free golf lessons I had, but it was a lot," he smiles.
The golfing scene in "Lucky You" is no ordinary game; it is part of an elaborate "proposition bet" conceived by an inveterate gambler named Ready Eddie, who is played by popular comic actor Horatio Sanz. Eddie gambles that Huck can't run five miles and shoot 18 holes of golf in 78 strokes or under, all in three hours or less. If he can do it, Huck will win the $10,000 he needs to stake his entry into the World Series of Poker. If not, he'll be another $10,000 in the hole.
Barrymore offers, "I think that's a great sequence in the film because Billie- seduced by the excitement of the competition-finds herself rooting for Huck. But then his willingness to do anything to win causes her to distrust him once again."
In the film, Ready Eddie is also engaged in an even more outlandish wager with a character named Lester, played by Saverio Guerra. Eddie bets Lester that he can't live for one entire month in the men's room at the Aladdin Hotel. What might seem even more peculiar than a guy having room service delivered to his lounge chair set up in a hotel men's room is that the same guy appears to have a decidedly female bustline-the result of yet another unconventional bet.
If moviegoers assume the outrageous bets portrayed in "Lucky You" are merely the invention of the screenwriters, they would be in for a surprise. In fact, side bets- both impromptu and planned-are fairly commonplace among gamblers who call Las Vegas home.
Surrounded by poker pros and gamblers during filming, Eric Bana witnessed firsthand that anything could spark a vigorous round of betting. "We were sitting at a poker table with these guys for weeks on end and they're just betting on everything," he laughs. "They'd bet on how many takes we would do for that set-up, or how many times the camera would have to move for that scene...anything to get their juices flowing."
THE PERFECT BLUFF
The filmmakers' dedication to verisimilitude was carried over into every aspect of the production, including the spot-on re-creation of the poker room at the Bellagio Hotel and Casino, which had been completely redecorated since 2003 when the story takes place.
The initial intention had been to shoot in the actual poker rooms, but the Bellagio's renovation made that impossible. Instead, the decision was made to build an exact replica of the Bellagio poker room, circa 2003, on a soundstage in Los Angeles. As it turned out, the timing of the Bellagio refurbishment could not have been more serendipitous. Production designer Clay A. Griffith reveals, "The hotel was auctioning off all the old murals, carpeting and furniture, so we just outbid everyone. The chandeliers, the drapes, the sconces-we got it all, which was fantastic because it was a very intricate set to build; there is so much latticework and detail, even on the ceiling. The Bellagio was also very cooperative. They even supplied copies of the original floor plans."
The result was an uncanny re-creation of the Bellagio's original poker room, as those who knew best testify. "It blew me away," says poker professional Daniel Negreanu. "It was surreal; it was the exact same Bellagio poker room that I remember. There was nothing at all different about it."
Fellow pro Erick Lindgren agrees. "I was almost scared when I walked in and saw the Bellagio set. It was like traveling back in time."
The pros had a similar reaction to Griffith's duplication of the famous "Benny's Bullpen," the upstairs multi-purpose room at Binion's Gambling Hall, where the final table of the WSOP Main Event was played in 2003. Matt Savage recalls, "I got chills walking into that room in L.A. and seeing how realistic it looked. They did an amazing job."
Griffith and his team could take particular pride in the observations of the one man whose opinion arguably mattered most: Jack Binion. "I couldn't believe the attention to detail to make everything so accurate," he remarks. "It was just great."
Remembering the humble beginnings of what is now the WSOP, Binion says no one could have predicted that Hollywood would someday come calling. "We weren't even thinking of it as a poker tournament; it was more of a poker `get together.' We started out with maybe 50 or 60 people, and it came down to a kind of consensus of opinion of who was the best poker player there. We never dreamed it would become this popular. I think the two things that really made the change were the hole card cam and the internet poker sites. It's just exploded, especially in the last few years."
Hanson verifies, "There were 631 players in the 2002 World Series of Poker. By 2006, that number had mushroomed to more than 8,000. Veteran players now find themselves going up against players who cut their teeth staring at avatars on a screen. I think that's part of the enormous appeal of the game today. Unless you're deluded, you don't really think you could go one-on-one with Allen Iverson on the basketball court or compete against Tiger Woods on the golf course. But in poker, you can play against the best, and, with a little luck, you can even win."
Apart from the replication of the Bellagio poker room and Benny's Bullpen, most of the principal photography on "Lucky You" was accomplished on location in Las Vegas, where, Denise Di Novi says, "Curtis wanted to show the Las Vegas that we haven't often seen on film-not the glitzy Vegas, but the diners and the shops and the neighborhoods where the people that live and work there hang out. Las Vegas exists in two parallel worlds: the modern tourist attraction Vegas and the old historic Vegas, which is more authentic."
Griffith confirms, "We wanted to show Las Vegas from different points of view, to combine classic and contemporary settings in terms of what was left of the old Vegas versus the new Vegas, where things are changing by the minute. That actually made scouting a challenge. There were places I found in November-like little restaurants that had been around since the `50s-that were suddenly gone when I went back in January."
"Sadly, I think Las Vegas is the quintessential example of our culture's failure to value what is authentic and historic and to instead favor a newer simulated version of the original," Fenelon comments. "Places that reflect the period in which they were built are being torn down everywhere in our country, but Las Vegas is perhaps the most extreme example of it. The Strip is an amalgamation of architectural make-believe."
Filming in Las Vegas also took place at the Aladdin Casino, the Polo Lounge, and in the actual poker pit at Binion's, as well as at the Bear's Best Golf Course, designed by the great Jack Nicholas, where each hole is a replica of a hole that exists on another famous golf course. Going behind the scenes at the Bellagio, Hanson shot Huck's arrival on a motorcycle in a work area underneath the casino that is off-limits to tourists and then followed him through a labyrinth of corridors and hidden stairways to a door where he literally pops out next to the stage of the popular Fontana Lounge on the casino floor.
Hanson notes, "One of the things I love is having the opportunity to go into a world other than my own-submerging myself in that world, learning as much as I can about it and then selectively using what I've learnt in the telling of a story. That was very much the case with the world of high-stakes, professional poker portrayed in `Lucky You.' The balancing act, if you will, was to try and show it in such a way that the people who really know it would feel it was a true representation of their world, and at the same time, to tell a story that's entertaining and maybe even enlightening to the rest of the audience."
NO BAD BEATS
For the filmmakers, music was another integral element in capturing the time, place and emotions of the story. Fenelon relates, "One of the first things we think about is the music. How can we use it to reveal the essence of the characters, the settings and the themes? Coming into `Lucky You,' Curtis and I both gravitated-independent of one another-toward the Americana music of artists like Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, Ryan Adams and George Jones."
Legendary music pioneer Bob Dylan had previously worked with Hanson and Fenelon on the film "Wonder Boys," writing the song "Things Have Changed," which brought the artist an Academy Award and a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. The filmmakers were thrilled when Dylan offered to compose a new song for "Lucky You." The result was "Huck's Tune," which Fenelon calls "the most mesmerizing contribution to the film's soundtrack. It is a perfect poetic rendition of the movie that cuts to the essence of both Huck and the film."
Other songs heard in "Lucky You" include: "Lucky Town" and "The Fever" (Bruce Springsteen); "Like a Rolling Stone" (Bob Dylan); "Let It Ride" (Ryan Adams); "El Paso" (Marty Robbins); a cover of Leonard Cohen's "Dance Me To The End of Love" (performed on camera in the Fontana Lounge at the Bellagio by Madeleine Peyroux); "Choices" and "I Always Get Lucky With You" (George Jones); a Kris Kristofferson cover of "They Ain't Got Em All" (also performed on camera by Drew Barrymore); and Drew Barrymore's cover of the George Jones classic "Cold Hard Truth."
"All of these songs are steeped in emotional truth, honestly and openly presented," Fenelon says. "They reveal the pain and frustration of love and life and growing old, of making the wrong choices, of taking risks and losing and trying again."

Q: I have been with my wife for 11 years. She had an affair with a friend for 2 years. Before that, this man was having an affair with another friend's wife that we both knew about, and I told my wife to stay away from him because he was no good. No matter how I spoke about this man, she decided to have a relationship with him. I have a daughter that I love very much. I tried to make things work four times because she asked me to come back home, but she didn't want to talk about it or go for counseling and she still continued to talk to the other man. The families of both households know what went on. She also brought him into my home to spend time. I am in the beginning of a divorce. The man's wife has called me three times and told me she is very emotional, and they are going to counseling. I have respected my wife and worked very hard to give us a nice life, but I don't think I can continue with this relationship. -- Paul, 35
Dr. Susan: You may be right about your marriage ending. If your wife won't talk to you, won't agree to counseling even to save your relationship, then she is apparently not as committed to making it work as you have been. It would be very hard for you to "get over" her two-year affair, yet it can be done. But only with her help and full cooperation. People get crazy when they're in the early stages of an affair. They don't think straight. They act like addicts. They actually forget how much they loved their own mate earlier on. They mistake this new person as their "real" love. If a marriage is to have any hopes of surviving, your wife has to let go of her affair partner completely. She's being unfair to you, your daughter, and the other couple also, as they seem to be trying to save their own marriage.!New images from Pokémon Sun and Moon have started to leak from CoroCoro, a popular Japanese magazine. The leaked images feature two new Pokémon. One of them is Nekkoala, who is classified as the Contagious Dream Pokémon. Nekkoala is Normal-type Pokémon with the ability Definite Sleep.
The other Pokémon shown is Iwanko, the Deep Eye Pokémon. This is the dog-like Pokémon that appeared in one the past trailers for the games. Iwanko is a Rock-type Pokémon and its abilities are Keen Eye or Vital Spirit.
Another leaked image shows more details about the features of the new Rotom Pokédex, like the QR scanner.
The last two images show off details about the new Pokémon movie, which features the new Pokémon Magearna.
According to the last two images, people that attend the movie will receive a Pokémon Ga-Olé disc that has a QR Code that once scanned in Pokémon Sun and Moon it will allow players to get Magearna in the games. Magearna will be at level 50, it will have the Soul Heart Ability, and a new move called Furuuru Cannon.
Expect to see the two Pokémon revealed in CoroCoro in the next Pokémon Sun and Moon footage we get to see. This will most likely be next week during E3 2016.We are registered suppliers of furniture to State and Central Government Departments.

Summary
This collection of essays aims to explore the transformations of the political landscapes within which Afro Latino social movements have been operating since the end of the 1970s. It is premised on the assertion that, distinctively in different national contexts, the major characteristic of these transformations has been the ideological alteration of the official narrative of national identity through the passage from ‘monocultural mestizaje’ and ‘invisibilization’ of Afro Latinos organized by the state and other dominant social actors to multiculturalism and state corporatism/cooptation.I know, I just started the Halloween features, but Christmas is fast on it’s tail. I like to know exactly who I’m buying for by October 1st. I do this so that I can check my stash and keep an eye out for deals on items for specific people.
My husband comes from a large family. Many of them do not see or speak to each other, which makes holidays difficult. We feel obligated to purchase gifts for them, as they always send gifts to us. The problem? They struggle dearly and we do not. We bargain shop, and they do not. I feel terrible about someone who cannot afford it purchasing my child a $25 gift when I pay a few pennies for theirs, even if the gifts I purchase are worth hundreds. What’s worse is that just a couple of us get together, so gifts are handed down at gatherings until they eventually make it to the intended party- months later.
The hubby says that we should only purchase for one of his nephews (they are very close). Of course, he’ll change his mind between now and then if the rest of the family doesn’t jump on board. Skipping in-law gifts will knock 16 names off of my list. At the $5 limit I set for myself, that’s only $80, but if it keeps the rest of the family from spending $400, it’s worth it.
I don’t like to see everyone else struggling to make ends meet and spending a fortune on gifts for my kids. I don’t mind to spend it on them, but I want to know NOW!
Do you guys have any ideas? Is this a problem for your family?
I don’t like drawing names and setting limits, because in order for me to hit a spending limit, one child will receive substantially more gifts than another. And, one sister holds the majority of the kids, so many that she would be purchasing for her own if names were drawn.
This is a good year to cut back for everyone; the economic downturn can be your scapegoat. One side of our family has stopped buying Christmas gifts entirely, but instead buy for birthdays so that it's spread throughout the year. We still get together and enjoy a huge meal, but now put the focus on being together and remember the Reason for the season. Another side of the family has started choosing a couple of families from the Share Your Christmas tree and buying for them instead. It makes everyone feel great to know we're helping someone less fortunate. By doing this, we're only buying for our immediate family (spouse & kids)….sure works for us!
[Reply]
I have to agree with K2save. Times are tough for all most everyone and Christams has become so commericalized anymore that many people tend to forget the real reason for the season. We buy for our most immediate family and for our parent's I send a money order made payable to the electric company as well one for their favorite store so if there is something they actually "need" they can get it (ie…groceries,prescriptions or those incidentials that we all use) One could also put together food baskets for family members that are struggling and perhaps a small toy for the child/children. It feels good to give and it does comes back to those that give with a open loving heart

Now, here's my question... how do I list the play on my sidebar? Officially, it's not published. No editor has seen it. I'm not sure I want to send it out for queries because I want the freedom to use the play with other non-profit groups with no budget. But it isn't in submission either.

The Play's the Thing...
Posted by Liana Brooks at 10:34 AM All About: publishing
Why are you worried about listing it in your sidebar? What the harm be in listing it? Am I missing something???
*looks around stupidly*
I'm not NaNo-ing either. I'm blogging. Because I'm lazy. Argh.
Um... because I'm being obsessive because my brain went and fused after writing 1k in 30 minutes.
If I could keep up a 2k an hour pace NaNo would be over very quickly :)
Congratulations Liana.
Maybe it warrents it's own section listed under performed?
:o) I might have to do that.
And, thank you. I have my fingers crossed. I'm hoping the play goes over well.
congradulations!! hope everything with it goes well :)I'm finding it hilarious that the Obama campaign is currently using Harry Reid, of all people, as point man on its current attack at Mitt Romney.
Of course there's some irony, and some tiny bit of backlash protection, provided by using a fellow Mormon to accuse Romney of paying nothing in income taxes for a decade. But the elegance and genius of the move is just astounding. (And I don't think there's any question Reid is doing this in coordination with the campaign... no way he'd go riding off on his own for a whole week like this, given the potential blowback.)
First, as Rachel Maddow points out, having Romney get into a scrap with the Senate Majority Leader makes Romney look weaker and like he's not really in Obama's class. (Which, as a politician, he clearly isn't.)
Second, it doesn't matter at all what Romney says in response to Reid's seemingly wild accusation. He can whine about Reid "putting up or shutting up" all he wants. The mere fact that he won't release his returns even in response to something as outrageous as this means people will assume that either a) Reid's accusation is true, or that b) it isn't true but what's in the returns is just as damaging. Keep in mind too that the rather inept and leak-prone McCain campaign already looked at his returns four years ago... whether or not you think that explains why they passed Romney over for Palin, it drastically increases the odds that the Obama campaign already has a pretty good idea of what's in those returns. Plus, Reid and the Obama campaign know damn well that there's basically zero chance Romney actually releases his returns to disprove the allegations. This is a guy who has been campaigning off and on for public office since the '90s and hadn't released any returns at all until the piddling drip of 2010 returns he reluctantly offered up for his presidential run.
Third, Romney's weak non-response further paints him as a bully who can dish it out but can't take it: a narrative that ties right in to the "haircut" incident from his school days and, frankly, his standard reaction to anyone who challenges him or doesn't back down from him.
Obama's just toying with the poor sap right now, and we're barely into August. Given Romney's innate cowardice and his campaign's tendency towards hiding their candidate, right now I'd put the odds at about 20% that they only debate once, and at about 10% that there are no debates between Obama and Romney at all. The more smacks to the mouth Romney takes, the more likely it becomes that he just turtles and tries desperately to let a tidal wave of super PAC money carry him into the White House.MAIDENCRAIG HOUSE

In Downsizing, a bracing comedy of shocking gravity, Payne and longtime writing partner Jim Taylor posit a future where human beings are offered the chance to shrink down to about five-inches in size and thereby be less of a burden on the besieged environment. And the money part's not bad either in a world where a little truly does go a long way. Any volunteers?
From WWII to the war on America's free press, a riot-torn Detroit to the Sunken Place – Peter Travers on his Top 10 films of the year
Paul Safranek (Matt Damon at his Everyman finest ) is intrigued. His job as an occupational therapist at Omaha Steaks is a mid-level trap. Paul and his wife Audrey (Kristen Wiig) have no children and nothing to hold them back. Plus, their BFFs (Jason Sudeikis and Maribeth Monroe), have gone small and they're loving it, raving about Leisureland, a dome-covered community (bugs, you know) where the small can live large in elegant surroundings, complete with pools and golf courses. Even the shrinking process is relatively painless once you shave your hair (otherwise you'll look like ZZ Top) and remove your fillings (otherwise your head will explode). Payne makes these changes as humorous and un-contrived as possible, the better to suck you into this brave new miniature world.
For a year, all is well for Paul, except for his wife's 11th-hour desertion and the hedonistic, Eurotrash boys next door, Dusan (Christoph Waltz) and Joris (Udo Kier), who keep pushing him to party. Sex, drugs and rock & roll still hold sway, even in miniature, and it's a kick to watch Waltz and Kier riotously indulge. Payne and his FX team achieve visual miracles, letting us see full-sized humans and those who've gone small in the same frame. Cheers to cinematographer Phedon Papamichael, production designer Stefania Cella and visual-effects master James E. Price for making the impossible seem thrillingly real.
It's only when Paul meets Ngoc Lan (Hong Chau), a Vietnamese dissident, shrunk against her will, who works as his maid, that his worldview begins to change. Despite the fact that she wears a prosthetic – one of her legs has been amputated below the knee – Ngoc is a one-woman army of protest and purpose, her broken English no obstacle to her blunt communication. And the Third World she occupies is a microcosm of the one made manifest in cold reality. Hong Chau, best known from Inherent Vice and HBO's Treme, achieves nothing less than an acting triumph. Her Best Supporting Actress nominations from the Golden Globes and the Screen Actors Guild are just the start of the honors coming her way. Her poignant scenes with Damon, an actor so good he can make decency intriguing, cut to the heart. As Paul and Ngoc move from unlikely friendship to unlikelier romance, Payne takes us on a journey that leaves everything at risk.
To say more would cheat audiences who enter this film, as they should, with no preconceptions. Downsizing brims over with the pleasures of the unexpected, a hallmark of Payne's artistry. His six previous films (Citizen Ruth, Election, About Schmidt, Sideways, The Descendants, Nebraska) center around characters at a crossroads, American dreamers grabbing at intangibles. Downsizing is no exception, though its sci-fi premise plays out against an atypically grand design. The visionary ambition of Downsizing is a new direction for Payne, and it's rough terrain. It's true that he juggles more ideas than he can keep airborne. And his social satire lacks the killer instinct to leave his dreamers in ruin. But that's the thing about Payne. His core humanity is as exhilarating and resonant as any new road he takes us on. Downsizing leads us to, of all things, the end of the world. Without a scintilla of Hollywood sentiment, Payne suggests it's a journey better traveled together. There's nothing small about that.Oklahoma City center Steven Adams has apologized after referring to Golden State's guards as "quick little monkeys" in an interview with ESPN's Chris Broussard following the Thunder's 108-102 Game 1 win over the Warriors on Monday.

source :Winnie and Wolf is the story of the extraordinary relationship between Winifred Wagner and Adolf Hitler that took place during the years 1925–40, as seen through the eyes of the secretary at the Wagner house in Bayreuth.
Win.
In the debacle of the post-Versailles world, the Wagner family hope for the coming, not of a warrior, a fearless Siegfried,.
Like Winnie, Hitler was an outsider. Like her, he was haunted by the impossibility opera.
In A.N. Wilson’s most bold and ambitious novel yet, the world of the Weimar Republic and Nazi Germany is brilliantly recreated, and forms the backdrop to this incredible bond, which ultimately reveals the remarkable capacity of human beings to deceive themselves.
I added this book to my TBR list when it was placed on The Booker Prize long list without even realising what it was about. Although this book didn't make it onto the shortlist, with the winners announcement just days away it seemed as though it was probably time to read at least one of the nominees! And besides someone else had requested it from the library, so I couldn't extend it again!
The blurb for this book in some ways describes only one aspect of the story that we read in it's pages, although it is the main part of the book. Not only is there the friendship between Winnie and Wolf, otherwise known as Winifred Wagner (daughter in law of the famous opera composer) and Adolf Hitler, there is the question of how was it that Hitler came to be the leader of Germany, and intertwined throughout this are various threads about the life of Richard Wagner and details relating to the staging of the Wagner festivals in Bayreuth during the 1930s.
Our narrator is an unnamed man, who is writing his story from behind the Iron Curtain in East Germany. He was secretary/administrator to Siegfried Wagner, (son of Richard and composer/ Wagner Festival director) and therefore was quite involved in the personal lives of the Wagner family. The reason our narrator is unnamed is that he is afraid of the dreaded Stasi police in East Germany - afraid mainly for himself - but also having been afraid for his daughter, even though she has long ago fled to the West.
He confesses through the pages things he could not confess even to his wife - that he knew a very different Hitler - a man who had a way with children and pets, who loved opera to the point of obsession, and that the narrator had had an unrequited love for Winnie (although his wife had pretty much guessed that!) . But make no mistake, this is not an book which tries to repaint the picture of Hitler as we know him, but more asks a couple of questions. How did this man become one of the most popular leaders in Germany ever? How could individuals and the German people as a whole have pretty much turned a blind eye to the early signs of what was to come? Was the fact that they went from a country in deep economic depression full of starving people to what appeared to be a viable economy enough to ignore the fact that people were being murdered and SS gangs were roaming the streets and towns, that there were camps set up where anyone opposed to the regime were being sent, even before WWII began.
From Page 33:
Is our capacity to love another person often (always) accompanied by an inability to notice what it is that prevents the majority of other people loving them? (In the case of Wolf there are many complicated factors at work, of course, since he was extremely popular, the most popular political leader our country had ever had - so were we all suffering from the same delusion as Winnie?)This wasn't a book that I could sit down and read in one sitting having become absolutely absorbed in. It is the kind of book that you have to work at. The storyline meanders from one of the threads to another and then back again, with a large cast of famous and infamous characters. Yet it works.
Not long after I finished it, I was asked whether I liked this book, and my answer was I really don't know. Is it possible to like a book that features Hitler as a character? The various facets of the story are interesting, the writing is challenging, and I am sure that if I really loved Wagner or opera in general that I might have been really captivated.
Trying to grade it was also therefore somewhat difficult. It wasn't so average that it should be 3.5 but if we want to go just on enjoyment that is probably around the mark. In the end, it was interesting enough and challenging enough to deserve the mark that I eventually gave it. Maybe I should just split the difference!
Would I rush out and buy more books by A N Wilson...probably not. Am I maybe just a tiny bit interested in seeing whether I can find some snippets of the operas mentioned in the novel.....yes. If I don't do that within the next couple of days will I forget about it? It's a definite maybe!

The weather was amazing. The ceremony was at St. Joseph University in Buffalo and the reception was at the Columns Banquets in Elma.
For the idle, we went to Knox Farm State Park. This location is very rustic, with barns, wooden fences, and rolling hills. It is great place for wedding photos. We love it also for engagement, maternity, and family portrait sessions.
When we arrive to a location, we always start with the bridal party for photos. We will take group pictures, then the groom with his groomsmen, and bride with her bridesmaids. We always try to get everyone involved and have fun. We know the wedding party does not really want to take photos, but this part of the day is important to the bride and groom. We keep everything moving as best we can, then send the party back to the limo and work with the bride and groom.
In this image, we have Jenne and her bridesmaids. This is the second shooter perspective. We had all the ladies lean up against one of the fences. The back drop would be rolling hills. While I was taking that angle, Neal asked the bride to look toward him. He was standing off to the side. This was his angle and it looks great! Jenna has such a great smile.
We always have two people photographing a wedding. Neal and Danielle Urban are a husband and wife team. Clients will receive two different styles of images representing both Neal and Danielle. Having two photographers allows us to capture different angles and emotions, just like you see here.
Location: 437 Buffalo Rd, East Aurora, NY 14052.It's now been 4 weeks since Mongolia. I've ridden less than I ever have in a month in my adult life. Commuted that first week, 1h ride on weekend ended in a broken arm. Not only have I ridden less than ever, I've been sedentary more than ever. I've walked to work more now, arm was sore even walking for the first while.
This week had two updates - a specialist appointment on the arm - essentially saying don't do surgery. If it was the ulna on the outside of the elbow with the thin skin covering it, he said they'd slap a few screws in there lickety split. The radius on the inside, and its angle of break. is right under all the veins/muscles/nerves/tendons of the inner forearm. Said that surgery would irritate the elbow so much that mobility would go from current "good" to "virtually nothing" again and start with a few degrees of movement and rehab. Plus it wouldn't be straightforward near zero risk stuff with everything that's in the way. So I'm just waiting and healing. I go back for xrays early November and presumably they'll just say "looks fine, off you go".
Hip had more fluid drained again. It's not a bad little routine, say 15 minutes, a freezing shot, 4-5 needles of recovery of fluid, then steroid and anti inflammatory injection. The big needle going in leaves that little section of skin looking pretty pincushioned after it all.
I feel good though and have most mobility back. I can almost straighten arm and almost bend it closed. Enough already for practical movement. The rotation of the hand is pretty good too, just a little shy of back to normal.
Strength is zilch. My right wrist feels like two bones wrapped in skin. I don't have the biggest forearms to start with (typing and moving a mouse isn't resistance training), but there's really nothing there. My tricep hasn't done anything in a month and has withered away. My arm is scrawny, the elbow looks like the widest point, where usually it looks like a thinner point with some degree of muscle around it.~Kat's Cat needs new kitties to add to the list of kitties to be posted!

Just a Phrase I'm Going Through
My Life in Language
Routledge, 2009 2009
New Books in LanguageNew Books in Politics & SocietyNew Books Network August 15, 2011 Chris Cummins.
The book follows Crystal’s career across an enormous range of linguistic disciplines, from English usage through clinical linguistics and on into semantic Web indexing. It also describes the many other channels along which Crystal’s enthusiasm for language has run – reconstructing the speech sounds of Shakespeare for the stage, presenting the case for endangered languages, and doing battle with the forces of ‘linguistic purism’ on the radio.
I talk with Crystal about his motivation for writing a memoir, the challenges of applied linguistics, and the unpredictable future of language and its study. Along the way, I learn how to sell parts of speech to a shoe merchant, how not to sell knives to internet users, and why we won’t be seeing a Broadway musical on the topic of language death.
Podcast: Download (Duration: 1:02:51 —)On the way to my camera shop one afternoon, we spotted this
delightful sight alongside the highway. The town was installing
new water pipes and here and there a new hydrant. I guess they
didn't want anybody to think they were a source of water for
fire-fighting until they actually were, but Ricky &
I took one look & simultaneously dubbed it "Christo's
fire-hydrant."
Wasn't till the end of August that I had a lovely sunny day
and I found a safe place to pull over so I could shoot half a
dozen photos of it. My timing was startling: the next time I
passed, the hydrant had been unwrapped <g>.
Ssssh! Don't tell Christo. I take it he has no sense of humor.
He squelched one of the funniest cards I ever saw in my life....
The front was a simple but lovely drawing of a Christmas tree
wrapped up in paper. Inside, it said, "Merry Christo!"
I laugh every time I think about it &, to this day, I'm sorry
I didn't see the card in time to buy one for myself.
Oh, & here's the capper to the joke. When I picked up
this roll of film from my developer, I was asked who the artist
was. They all thought the fire-hydrant was the last of the umpteen
rolls I'd shot at Grounds
for Sculpture! Perfect! Ahahahahaha!
[21 Feb 05: This is the page I posted sometime in 2001 (I
think). As much as I'd like to rewrite it completely, I haven't
the energy. Please take it as-was. Thanks.]Now you can buy tablets in six-packs just like soda – and you even get the little cardboard carrier.
The tablet in question is Amazon’s new Fire, which at about $50 is so affordable that it can be bought in bulk — pay for five, get a sixth free — for less than the price of a single iPad mini 2.
The cheap Fire is among a number of products Amazon announced in its ongoing bid to be an alternative to Apple in the tablet and video-player markets. (Amazon has thus far failed in the smartphone market, having yanked its poor-selling Fire Phone without announcing a replacement — see my review, “Amazon Fire Phone Too Limited and Gimmicky,” 25 July 2014).
Amazon’s new products also include a couple of mainstream, higher-priced tablets, a tablet aimed at children, and a Fire TV streaming box that supports 4K Ultra HD video (something Apple can’t claim with its recently revamped Apple TV).
Pricing on all of this hardware positions Amazon as a budget option compared to Apple, which typically targets the higher end. Amazon also is focused on content consumption (with that content purchased from Amazon, natch), while Apple has lately pushed tablet-based productivity and content creation.
Fire -- For $49.99, value-conscious buyers get a 7-inch tablet with a 1.3 GHz quad-core processor, a 1024-by-600 IPS color display, and rugged construction that, Amazon claims, makes the Fire nearly twice as durable as the iPad Air 2 (“as measured in tumble tests,” whatever that means).
The Fire also has 8 GB of storage (only 5 GB is available to the user, but storage is expandable to 128 GB via microSD card) along with front-facing (VGA quality) and rear-facing (2 megapixel) cameras.
Those choosing the six-pack route pay $250 for a half-dozen Fires tucked into an orange cardboard tote. By comparison, one 7.9-inch iPad mini 2 with 16 GB of storage costs $269.
The Fire is set to ship 30 September 2015.
Fire HD 8 and 10 -- The “Fire HD” moniker has long referred to Amazon’s high-end tablets with HD touchscreens, and this category just got a refresh.
New 8-inch and 10.1-inch Fire HD models start at $149.99 (8 GB, with 16 GB available) and $229.99 (16 GB, with 32 GB available). This compares to an iPad mini 4 starting at $399 and an iPad Air starting at $499, both with 16 GB of storage.
The new Fire HD tablets are thinner and lighter than their precursors and, like the Fire, are said to be more durable than comparable iPads.
The new tablets are colorful, too. The Fire HD 8 comes in black, magenta, blue, and tangerine, while the Fire HD 10 comes black and white.
Both new Fire HD tablets have a display resolution of 1280-by-800 along with 1.5 GHz quad-core processors. Boosting the on-board storage the next level ups the cost by $20 and $30, respectively. Storage is further expandable to 128 GB via microSD.
They are scheduled to ship 30 September 2015.
Amazon continues to sell a $99.99 6-inch Fire HD 6 tablet that apparently won’t see an update during this product cycle.
Fire Kids Edition -- For $99.99, parents can buy a child-friendly tablet with a large blue or purple bumper along with built-in parental controls.
They also get a 2-year accidental-damage replacement guarantee, and a year of free access to Amazon’s Kindle FreeTime Unlimited service that offers 8,000 kid-friendly videos, books, games and educational apps. Normally, the service starts at $2.99 per month for Amazon Prime members with one child; it maxes out at $9.99 per month for four children (and no Amazon Prime membership).
The 7-inch Fire Kids Edition tablet is otherwise comparable to the 7-inch, $50 Fire with a 1.3 GHz quad-core processor, 1024-by-600 touchscreen, front- and rear-facing cameras, and 8 GB of storage (again, only 5 GB is available to the user). This begs the question for some, why not buy a identically specced Fire at half the cost, and put it in a protective case?
The Fire Kids Edition replaces the 2014 Fire for Kids tablet. Like the other new models, the Fire Kids Edition ships 30 September 2015.
Amazon Underground -- The Fire tablets for adults include a service called Amazon Underground, which offers free access to what Amazon claims is more than $10,000 in paid apps, games and in-app purchases.
Amazon Underground is part of Amazon’s emphasis on content consumption, with the use of its tablets for reading, watching, and playing. The company also sells tablet keyboards for productivity, but downplays this aspect.
That is in sharp contrast to Apple, which recently made tablet-based productivity an emphasis during its debut of the jumbo iPad Pro (see “iPad Pro with Smart Keyboard and Apple Pencil Announced,” 9 September 2015), and updated its iOS 9 operating system with worker-friendly features like Split Screen and trackpad-like cursor positioning.
You might wonder why app developers would sign up for Amazon Underground. They’re not doing it for free — Amazon will pay a developer based on the amount of time that developer’s app is used. The rate is $0.0020 per minute (that’s two-tenths of a cent), which means a penny per five minutes, or 12 cents per hour. For a game that would otherwise sell for $0.99, the developer will have to entice you to play for 8.25 hours.
Fire TV with 4K Last year’s Fire TV streaming device introduced a remote with an integrated microphone for simple voice search (see our coverage in “Fire Watch with Me: Amazon Fire TV vs. Apple TV,” 13 May 2014).
Now Amazon is upping the ante with an upgraded box that supports 4K Ultra HD video, along with access to a library of 4K video content. 4K support was notably absent from the Apple TV features trumpeted during Apple’s recent product mega-event (see “The Fourth-Generation Apple TV Is Coming at Last,” 9 September 2015).
Voice control has been upgraded with access to Alexa, the intelligent assistant that also is available via the Amazon Echo smart speaker. This Amazon move mirrors a recent Apple announcement that Siri will be available via a microphone-equipped remote for the new Apple TV.
Amazon adds, snarkily, that the new Fire TV offers “voice search that actually works.”
The Fire TV has 8 GB of on-board storage, expandable to 128 GB via microSD card, along with a quad-core processor, a dedicated GPU, and support for 802.11ac wireless connectivity.
Amazon will charge $99.99 for the new Fire TV, due 5 October 2015. For an extra $30, Amazon will trade the Voice Remote for the Fire TV Game Controller, a 32 GB microSD card, and two free games as part of the Fire TV Gaming Edition bundle. The Voice Remote costs an additional $29.99 for Gaming Edition buyers.
For comparison, the new Apple TV will cost $149 for a 32 GB model and $199 for a 64 GB version.
Amazon also is offering an updated version of its Fire TV Stick, a dongle-style device that plugs directly into a TV’s HDMI port. The new Fire TV Stick with Voice Remote is voice-enabled – but apparently not Alexa-enabled. It runs $49.99 and is due 22 October 2015.
Amazon’s current $39.99 Fire TV Stick (without the Voice Remote) sticks around, just as Apple is continuing to sell its current, long-in-the-tooth Apple TV for $69. The original Fire TV streaming box, however, is listed as unavailable on Amazon.
Amazon’s Hardware Play -- Despite the failure of Amazon’s Fire Phone, the company is clearly going all in with hardware, with devices designed to handle the major media types that Amazon sells: books (Kindle e-readers and Fire tablets), video (Fire TV and Fire tablets), apps (Fire tablets and Fire TV), and music (Fire tablets and Amazon Echo).
Although Apple sells exactly the same kinds of content, the contrast with Apple’s approach is stark. Where Apple’s focus has always been on making money through its premium hardware, Amazon sees its less-expensive devices as ways to sell more content and encourage users to shop more generally at Amazon.
Given the rate of technological change, it isn’t hard to see the utility of buying inexpensive hardware and replacing it more frequently, if desired.2014 BMW X5 $29,995 42,392 Miles Rolling back prices..

Veggie risotto takes more preparation time but a fraction of the cooking time. Overall, I'm really happy with the "risotto" that I made out of turnip, which is pictured here.
First I used my spiralizer to make turnip noodles. (Here's my first spiralizer post and you can see which one I own by looking at the pictures and the links.) Then I took the turnip noodles and pulsed them in the food processor for about five seconds in total. I did this in batches, until all the turnip was turned into bits the size and shape of rice.
Vegetables are the perfect replacement for rice if you want to eat a lower carbohydrate diet. I have decided that veggie rice is actually more tasty than regular rice and just as versatile. In the past I have made riced cauliflower and recently I made rice out of daikon. Riced turnip worked so well because the turnip is firm enough to hold its shape yet it still cooks quickly. Also turnip is not an overpowering flavour, so it fits well in a dish like tomato, basil, and red wine "risotto". There are so many other flavours in this dish that there is a need for a neutral backdrop. Turnip rice plays that role perfectly.
Just like risotto, you can cook veggie rice to your desired doneness. I like my risotto still a little firm, possibly even a tad crunchy. But if you like your risotto softer, test it while cooking by biting into a little bit of the turnip rice to see if it has reached your desired texture.
Tomato, Basil, and Red Wine "Risotto" with Minced Pork and Sliced Aubergine (Eggplant)
serves 4
inspired by Donna Hay in New Food Fast
and Inspiralizedand Inspiralized
2 small aubergines (eggplants), about 450 g total
mild olive oil
2 medium turnips, about 600 g total
300 g minced pork
1/2 c red wine (or vegetable stock)
2 tomatoes, chopped
1/2 c (20 g) shredded basil
1/2 c (50 g) grated parmesan cheese
Cut the aubergines into 1/2 cm slices. Brush on both sides with oil. Pan fry over high heat for four minutes on each side.
Do this in batches and then set aside and keep warm.
Meanwhile, spiralize the turnips into noodles. Place the noodles into a food processor and pulse briefly to create rice-sized pieces. Take care not to over-process.
In a large pan, heat some more oil and scramble fry the pork mince.
Add the riced turnip and red wine and stir to combine.
Cover and allow the rice to steam for five minutes.
Add the tomatoes. Cook for three minutes.
Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the basil and parmesan cheese.
Serve the risotto topped with aubergine slices.

Be in a bubble of spirituality, peace and quiet. During your retreat you will be among monks and nuns whose wisdom and experience fasting will help you achieve your water fasting goals. Have a safe experience fasting receiving the proper guidance, environment and encouragement while. Sip on water throughout your day knowing you are detoxing and healing yourself. What a perfect way to relax during an intense experience!
Water Options
Direct Guidance
Peaceful Environment
Monitoring
Safe Fast-Breaking
Support
We do not recommend anyone who is taking medications to do a water fast.
To provide the right environment for water fasting we do not accept the following individuals:
1. Individuals with heart problems, mental illness, PTSD, taking medications, or excessive mental negativity. Fasting can occasionally trigger negative symptoms and we do not accept anyone under these conditions.
2. Individuals with any condition/infection that releases pus, ooze, skin, or anything else that might compromise the health of other guests as well as the cleanliness of our center.
3. Individuals with no interest to grow spiritually or to be engaged in the ashram’s activities.
4. Individuals working or conducting business of any sort while at the retreat.
5. Individuals fasting JUST to lose weight.
Sometimes a person.
Only in a few cases did we have to recommend a person to break their fast early because of signs and symptoms their body was showing. Everyone has broken their fast safely while under our guidance.
We will provide you with the information you need in order to break your fast; however, it is preferred you break your fast under right guidance as that is a critical part of the fast. If the fast is broken improperly, it can hurt the body.
If you would like to learn classes during your water fast experience, you can sign up and register for any workshop. The breathing techniques from the Purnam System.
Any time is a good time to water fast. Because the body temperature drops slightly during a water fast, it is best to fast during warmer months like April to October. Guests still water fast through the winter, but it is important to stay very warm during this time (bringing extra clothes and blankets).
Our water comes from our local town. They get the water from a running river 1600 ft below the ground. Our water is very soft, unlike tap water you typically find in a bigger city. At our center, we run the water through a Berkey Purification System which removes viruses, harmful pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, pesticides, herbicides, pharmaceuticals, heavy metals, unhealthy contaminants and impurities to below detectable levels while leaving in most of the essential minerals your body needs. The water is refreshing, crisp, and perfectly pure for your water fast.
It depends. Every body is different and losing weight is normal during a water fast. The longer the water fast, the more weight you can lose but it will be in proportion to your body. On average our guests lose about 7 lbs. per week. Once you break your water fast and return to eating you will gain some weight back. How much weight will depend on how active you are and the diet you return to. If you are looking for a more permanent solution for losing weight then you will need to consider changing your diet and being more active in your life. For example, we teach the Purnam System to help you lose weight through special intensive breathing techniques combined with yoga postures as well as promote a balanced vegetarian diet, which will automatically help you remove all those negative and hurtful toxins.
No, there are no medical professionals or physicians to oversee your fast. Monks and nuns will oversee your fast who are personally experienced with water and dry fasting for various extended periods of times, and who have helped many others successfully complete their water fasts.
Yes, you can participate in multiple workshops during your retreat if other programs are being offered. During a 3-day stay, we do not advise more than two workshops. To learn more about adding on an another retreat, click here for more information.
We do not offer enemas and PROHIBIT self-served enemas.
Yes, you can have a silent retreat too. You can ask your questions by writing them on a piece of paper, or you can ask your questions in class, then return to your silence once class is over.
Yes, we do offer private consultations in 30-minute and 1-hour sessions on a first-come, first-serve basis. You can request your private consultation at the time of registration or during your program. To learn more about the private consultation, click here.
An ashram is a beautiful place conducive to spiritual learning and self-improvement. It is the perfect place to experience higher thinking through simple living. We offer clean accommodations with all the essentials. Even if you have never done a water fast or a spiritual retreat you will gain tremendous insight about yourself. Expect to increase your willpower, strengthen your confidence, experience humbleness, heal your body, purify your soul, learn directly from monks and nuns, and expand your consciousness, peace, & happiness. Check out our reviews page to hear from past guests directly in their words.
Because of the nature of water fasting, we have found that our guests have a better experience when they have their own room. Sleeping patterns change during a fast and this can be uncomfortable for guests sharing a.Health & Safety

By Jennifer Olin, BSN, RN
Palliative care and hospice nursing have been the focus of several articles this week on Notes from the Nurses’ Station. Caring for the chronically or seriously ill and nursing care for people at the end of life is a very special area that takes a certain amount of special education. There are nursing programs and courses that focus on palliative care, there is a certification and a professional organization for nurses who find their passion in nursing these unique patients.
The baby boomer generation is quickly moving into old age. Many of this generation are sandwiched between caring for their children and grandchildren while also being responsible for their elderly parents. Palliative and hospice nursing is growth industry. Even the American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN) has addressed the issue of end-of-life nursing care and developing competencies for educators and nurses to meet as this specialty area grows in need.
Palliative Care Nursing
According to the Hospice and Palliative Nurses Association (HPNA).
To become a palliative care nurse most providers require RNs to have at least one year of acute care experience, excellent assessment skills, and clear and concise communications skills. Since both palliative and hospice care are provided by a team approach there is a lot of dependence on the nurse since it is the nursing providers who will see the patient most often. The interdisciplinary team will rely on the nurse’s assessment to make decisions for the plan of care and both the care team and the client’s family will need information that is timely, accurate, and, particularly for the family, easy to understand.
Any level of RN can work as and be certified as a palliative care and hospice nurse. Hospice and palliative nurses are prepared at the associate- degree, baccalaureate-degree, and even the master’s-degree level. A small percentage of hospice and palliative nurses hold a doctoral degree.
Palliative care can be offered anywhere patients are seen in any stage of illness. Palliative care programs are seen most often in hospitals, though there are programs that are found in outpatient care and other areas.
Hospice Nursing
Hospice care, a part of palliative care, is provided to patients during the end stages of their disease process and is defined by Medicare regulations stating that a patient is thought to be in their last six months of life. Hospice care is provided in the patient’s home regardless of whether this is a private home, a personal care home, a skilled nursing facility, correctional facility, group home, or hospice run residential facility. There are also inpatient hospice units in hospitals that are used most frequently to help control symptoms so that the patient can return to their home. Hospice care is focused on the patient and those who love them, wherever they reside.
No matter the setting, hospice care is given by an interdisciplinary team which typically includes RNs, LP/VNs, nursing assistants, a social worker, a chaplain, volunteers, and a medical director. The patient and family are also considered part of the team. Others like occupational or physical and speech therapists may also be part of the team. The entire team works toward meeting the goals of the patient and family.
Nurses.
Hospice nurses work in a variety of settings, there can be extensive travel, care environments that may be threatening, unpredictable hours, and variable levels of reimbursement. Palliative care and hospice nurses earn salaries comparable to other registered nurses. If the nurse holds an advanced degree specialized in palliative or hospice care the salary is usually comparable to that of nurse practitioners.
Education
There is a distinct body of knowledge with direct application to the practice of hospice and palliative care nursing. This includes: pain and symptom management; end-stage disease processes; psychosocial, spiritual, and culturally sensitive care of patients and their families; interdisciplinary collaborative practice; loss and grief issues; patient education and advocacy; bereavement care; ethical and legal considerations; communication skills; and awareness of community resources.
There are fewer than 20 universities that offer graduate level education programs with a focus on hospice and palliative care. Some of those schools merely offer a few courses, while others offer enough classroom and clinical experience to earn a certification, specialization, minor degree or post-graduate certification in hospice and palliative care. All these different programs fall under the auspices of masters level programs offering adult (ANP), pediatric (PNP) and doctoral (DNP) nurse practitioner education and training. There are currently two master’s degree programs that focus on specifically on hospice and palliative care – New York University (New York, NY) and Ursuline College (Pepper Pike, OH).
For nurses who are not working on a graduate degree but prefer to focus their time on their careers in palliative and hospice care nursing the HPNA offers continuing education courses and credits. There is also certification credentialing in this specialty for all levels of nursing (APN, RN, pediatric RN, LP/VN, nursing assistant) and administrator.
Finally, to be a palliative care or hospice nurse you must have the temperament and emotional stability for the job. It takes a lot of self-assessment to be sure you can handle the patients and the families you will be providing for. A hospice nurse must be very patient and compassionate. When people are critically ill or facing death they may not be easy to care for, their own fears, worries, and illness outweigh everything else. A palliative care or hospice nurse must be able to encourage and provide comfort to not only their immediate client but to the client’s family and friends as well.We were so fortunate to be about to collaborate with School Linked Services and Measure A to provide funding for this event.

This fine six storied step battlemented tower
house was built by the O'Flahertys around the end of the fifteenth
century
it is one of some 200 tower houses in Galway. The castle stands
on the shores of Lough Corrib, Aughnanure Castle sits inside a double
Bawn. The outer Bawn has a turret and encloses the ruins of a banqueting
hall, dating from the sixteenth century.
The O'Flaherty clan held the castle until
1572, when it was captured by the President of Connaught, Sir Edward
Filton.
During the Cromwellian invasion it was used
to blockade Galway, later it was granted to the Earl of Clanrickard,
who soon after lost it to the O'Flahertys. Who lost it to Lord St.
George as the result of the foreclosure of a mortgage. It is now
in the possession of the state.
From the tower is a fine view
of Lough Corrib.Jesse Owens, the amazing American track and field star who won the gold medal in the 1936 Olympics will forever be a staple in American sports history. On Sunday, his gold medal was sold at an auction to the billionaire owner of the Pittsburgh Penguins, Ron Burkle for $1,466,574 setting the record for the highest price ever paid for Olympic memorabilia.
Jesse Owens, the son of sharecroppers and the grandson of slaves dismantled the Aryan supremacy that Adolf Hitler was planning to showcase at the Olympics. His gold medal is a symbol of so much more than just the game. It symbolizes hope, freedom and the advancement of African-Americans in their fight for equality around the globe.
Owens won four gold medals in the 1936 Olympics, and the whereabouts of the other three are still unknown.

Fourth place Liverpool will look to keep pace with the leading pack when they take welcome Aston Villa to Anfield, in the evening kickoff on Saturday.
LIVERPOOL V ASTON VILLA ODDS
WILLIAM HILL EXCLUSIVE!
Latest Odds: Liverpool 1/4, Draw 6/1, Aston Villa 14/1
Popular UK firm William Hill have announced they are offering free bets worth £25/€25 to all new customers to spend on the midweek coupon!
The Reds have made a stunning start to 2014 winning all three games to date in January with 9 goals scored and just two conceded. Brendan Rodgers side have lost two of their last 9 games, losing away to both Manchester City and Chelsea, winning 6 league games and one cup in that run.
The last time out the club beat Stoke 5-3, a game that saw Daniel Sturridge return to action with a goal and an assist.
The England’s man return to form so early after a two month absence was most pleasing to his manager who has tipped the player to become a truly world class forward.
.”
Sturridge looks set to start on Saturday resuming the SAS partnership with Luis Suarez that has so far this season yielded 31 league goals.
Joe Allen and Mamadou Sakho are also back in contention following recent injuries however Daniel Agger, Jon Flanagan, Sebastian Coates and Jose Enrique are all out.
Villa meanwhile received their own striker boost on Monday when Christian Benteke scored his first goal since September in the 2-1 loss to Arsenal.
The Belgian has had a mixed season, starting the season on-fire but then succumbing to injury and the goal will be a welcome boost ahead of the second half of the season.
The arrival of Grant Holt on loan from Wigan will help ease the striking burden on Benteke with the former Norwich man set to go straight into the squad.
Nathan Baker misses out after he suffered concussion against Arsenal.
Four of Villa’s six wins this season have come on the road but they face a tough task against a Liverpool side that has won 10 of their 11 games at Anfield this season

Not My Job: We Quiz Lena Headey On Games Worse Than 'Game Of Thrones'
Download
Vera Anderson/WireImage
Game of Thrones may possibly have killed off numerous main characters, but the manipulative, scheming Queen Cersei is nonetheless standing. She’s played by Lena Headey, who we’ve invited to play a game known as “You win and you die.”
Because The Game of Thrones does not sound particularly enjoyable to play, we’ll ask 3 questions about even worse games.
Transcript
PETER SAGAL, HOST:
And now the game exactly where we invite on people we like and make them answer questions about factors they know nothing at all about. “Game Of Thrones” is the most well-known Tv show on the planet, in spite of obtaining an extremely complex plot and also a habit of killing off major characters. But nonetheless surviving following six seasons is the manipulative, scheming Queen Cersei Lannister. She’s played by the quite nice actress Lena Headey. She joins us now. Lena, welcome to WAIT WAIT… Do not Inform ME.
LENA HEADEY: Thank you.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: Now, I know the cliche that you are but an actor. You are not the components that you play, however at the prospect of speaking to you, I was actually terrified. Does this take place to you a lot?
HEADEY: Yeah, it does appear to. Folks do look to think that I am going to be some wicked witch, and then they’re often surprised to locate out I am just a little clumsy nerd.
SAGAL: Actually? Do you enjoy playing somebody who is so pointedly not cheerful and happy?
HEADEY: Yeah, it is cathartic since I guess, you know, it is not socially acceptable to be a full and utter manipulative cow. So I can get it all out…
SAGAL: I guess so. I really feel that both for men and women who haven’t observed “Game Of Thrones,” and I pity them, or for folks who have observed it and can not hold the names straight, could briefly describe who your character is?
HEADEY: She is the energy-hungry mother of 3 kids by her brother, desperate to sit on the throne and run the seven kingdoms.
SAGAL: Right.
HEADEY: And she’s not a really nice girl.
SAGAL: No, she’s not.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: And so for six seasons, we’ve essentially observed her manipulate, lie, lure men and women to their deaths and do a variety of unpleasant issues.
HEADEY: Yeah, she’s had a few rough days.
SAGAL: I understand.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Since the individuals on the show, the characters, are so incredibly unpleasant and are constantly undertaking very unpleasant things to every other, I think about your cast parties are, like, blowout entertaining due to the fact you must have to, like, let off all the steam of getting horrible to every single other.
HEADEY: There’s a lot of Olympic drinking, yes.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Now, you have played a lot of extremely – I will – for lack of a greater word – nerdy roles. You have been in the big classic nerdy Greek combat film “300” as the…
HEADEY: Yeah.
SAGAL: …Sexy Queen Gorgo. So the nerds must freak out when they see you on the street.
HEADEY: Yep, I get a bit of nerd really like.
SAGAL: You do?
HEADEY: (Unintelligible).
SAGAL: What is nerd enjoy like?
HEADEY: Loud. And…
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Did you – I have to ask you this question – you, like a lot of the actors on “Game Of Thrones, did not read the books, appropriate?
HEADEY: No.
SAGAL: And is that due to the fact you didn’t want to uncover out what happened to your character in yet another medium or they’re just a ridiculous nerd issue and you would by no means go near such a thing?
HEADEY: Both of those issues.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: And…
HEADEY: I did attempt. My mother read them all obsessively. And so I get the sort also intriguing to get into, to walk naked in a stroll of shame, as somebody’s…
HEADEY: Yes.
SAGAL: …Yelling shame through the entire town. That was a very extended sequence. Now, initial of all, did you really have to do that?
HEADEY: Yes, I was truly there, contrary to common belief, in the location undertaking the complete thing. But I was not naked although.
SAGAL: You had been not naked?
HEADEY: Not my physique.
SAGAL: That was not – truly? Did they do the personal computer thing exactly where they gave you somebody else’s body?
HEADEY: They did, yes.
SAGAL: Did you get to choose whose physique it was?
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Due to the fact offered the opportunity, I would actually get pleasure from to have some – my head place on somebody else’s physique.
HEADEY: You’d consider, but I – you know what? I was just like if somebody is brave enough to do this with me, then I never care what they appear like.
SAGAL: Correct.
HEADEY: I actually do not.
SAGAL: There was 1 guy in that sequence who leaps out and exposes himself to your character. And all I could believe of with that guy was like hey everybody, I got a portion in “Game Of Thrones.”
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: It is going to make me.
HEADEY: I know due to the fact, you know, we all sat around for, like, three days sort of tag-teaming on and off that set. And he was there we have been sort of possessing coffee. And I was like so, what are you – what are you doing? He was like oh, I am flashing my willy at you.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: So what’s fascinating is for individuals that might not know, the series is based on this extremely lengthy complicated series of books. But last season, season six, they caught up with the finish of the books. So nobody knows what’s taking place subsequent except you, Lena Headey…
HEADEY: Yeah.
SAGAL: …Due to the fact the production has been completed, proper? It is going to be broadcast in a couple of months. So what are the secrecy rules? I imply, what do they inform you about what you can and cannot say?
HEADEY: I can’t inform you a factor.
SAGAL: You can not inform me a thing.
HEADEY: No.
SAGAL: If you were to tell me one thing, what would happen to you?
HEADEY: It is far more what would occur to you.
(LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE)
HELEN HONG: Somebody would jump out and flash their willy at you for positive. especially exciting to play…
HEADEY: Yes.
SAGAL: …Ask Ned Stark. So we thought we’d ask you about three even worse games. Answer two of them appropriately, you are going to win our prize for 1 of our listeners – Carl Kassel’s voice on their voicemail. Bill, who is actress Lena Headey playing for?
HEADEY: Chris Shields of Beaverton, Ore.
SAGAL: All proper, you ready to play, Lena?
HEADEY: Yes, I’m ready.
SAGAL: All proper, now, which of these is a genuine board game that you could go out, purchase and play with your family members today if you wanted to? Is it A, Swedish Parliament in which you and your buddies recreate the Swedish national elections around your dining room table, B, “Family Time” in which you play a member of a household attempting to make a decision some thing to do that will hold you from fighting tonight or C, Mule in which you attempt to smuggle as many drugs across the border utilizing your personal physique cavities as possible.
ROY BLOUNT, JR.: Ooh.
(LAUGHTER)
HEADEY: God, one particular of them sounds more fascinating, but I’m going to go for the second 1, the family point – the non-fighting.
SAGAL: So a game referred to as Family Time…
HEADEY: Yes.
SAGAL: …In which you and your family gather about and play the roles of a family members attempting to determine to figure out what to do…
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: …Of an evening. So that’s your option, you are going to go for Family Time?
HEADEY: I am, yes.
SAGAL: All correct. I am afraid it was Swedish Parliament. That is an actual game that you can purchase. It was listed as one of the ten-worst board games ever made by a British newspaper, The Guardian. And then they published an apology because all these fans of “Swedish Parliament” wrote in and said, you know, it really is actually really interesting.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: All right, in 2013, a designer created a new iPhone game that speedily got banned from the App Shop. Was it which of these – A, Send Me To Heaven, which challenges you to throw your telephone as high as you can into the air…
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: …B, Massive Jerk – the object of that game is to stroll by as several folks as you can even though staring at your telephone or C, Drug Mule which is an iPhone version of the board game I mentioned in the earlier question.
(LAUGHTER)
HEADEY: I – I am going to go for the second one.
SAGAL: You are going to go for Massive Jerk?
HEADEY: (Laughter).
SAGAL: You’re going to go for that?
HEADEY: I really feel very strong in my answer.
SAGAL: I – I – no. No, I am afraid the game was Send – (laughter) – the game was Send Me To Heaven. And it was invented by a guy who just wanted to see how several folks he could trick into wrecking their iPhones by hurling them as higher as they could into the air.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: And really, the comments on the game in, like, the app shop have been I broke my phone.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: All proper, let’s see if you can get one proper. The 1960s were a golden age of board games. One particular of the less-effective games from that era is which of these – A, Digestion Monopoly, which is like normal monopoly except right after you select your piece you swallow it.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Whoever gets their’s back 1st wins.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: B – B, I say, Connect Two or C, a board game named Big Funeral. You play by planning a funeral.
HEADEY: Oh, I never want to get it incorrect. But I know, I am going to say the funeral game.
SAGAL: The funeral game – you are right, it is in reality the funeral game…
(SOUNDBITE OF BELL, APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: …Massive Funeral. Bill, how did Lena Headey do on our quiz?
KURTIS: Lena got one particular right out 3. And, you know, Lena, that’s genuinely very is in theaters now, and you can see her in the new season of HBO’s “Game Of Thrones.” That premieres in April. I am lining up in front of my tv now. Lena Headey, thank you so much for joining us.
HEADEY: Thank you, guys.
SAGAL: Thank you, Lena.
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, “KILLER QUEEN”)
QUEEN: (Singing) She’s a killer queen. Gunpowder, gelatine, dynamite with a laser beam. Assured to blow your thoughts…
SAGAL: In just a minute, Bill says words, some of which rhyme. It’s our Listener Limerick Challenge. Get in touch with 1-888-WAIT-WAIT to join us on the air. We’ll be back in a minute with far more WAIT WAIT… Never Tell ME from NPR.

JonThe South Windsor Police Department was recently recognized as the top fundraising team for the Special Olympics of Connecticut. The department raised $56,712 for the organization.
Agent Ron Littell is the organizer of the SWPD's fundraising events throughout the year and has been involved with the Special Olympics since 2000.
"The South Windsor Police Department and Agent Ron Littell have been amazing partners of SOCT for years. Over the years their events have grown and, most importantly, our athletes continue to get more involved every year," said Jackie Turro, director of special events for the Special Olympics of CT.
Between the Tip-a-Cop at the Red Onion (which consistently raises several thousand dollars a year), the Haunted Torch Walk, and the Ellington Plunge, the SWPD is involved with SOCT on a year-round basis.
Littell was honored with the first ever Exceptional Community Service Award late last year for his efforts in supporting the Special Olympics. He said he often donates his own money to help buy materials to fund events and never looks to be reimbursed because he feels he is just making a donation. However, he thinks that all the people around him who play a part in fundraising should be recognized.
"I'm glad to get the award and was ecstatic to get it, but honestly, it's the community, employees, and businesses that make it all possible," Littell said. "South Windsor residents always support it, too. It's really a team effort."
Littell said he is happy that the SWPD raised a large amount of money last year and is proud of the accomplishment, but he isn't trying to outdo last year's final tally.
"I obviously want to go above and beyond what we did, but it's more about getting the Special Olympics one more dollar than they had before; that's most important," he said. He added that every cent that someone donates goes toward a good cause. "Even if it's pocket change, it still adds up."
Many of the residents Littell meets during fundraising events have the misconception that he has a relative with special needs. Noting how involved he is in so many events that benefit Special Olympics, some are surprised to learn that is not what motivates him.
"I do what I do because I see the smiles that can be put on the families' faces that have children with special needs," Littell said. "They appreciate it; that's the best thing."
Even though he is not related to anyone that has special needs, he has met families all over the country who have had to deal with hardships but somehow keep pressing forward, which he said is inspiring.
"When you see a parent get up and speak on behalf of that child, and the family is dealing with the cards they've been dealt, and the kids are always up and happy, people should realize that their bad days are nothing [in comparison], Littell said."
This year's fundraising events kick off on March 21 with the Penguin Plunge at Crystal Lake in Ellington. Registration for the "freezin' for a reason" event is from 10-11:45 a.m. and the penguins will take the plunge at 12 noon. To register, join a team, make donations or volunteer, visit. All proceeds benefit Special Olympics Connecticut.Fr?
Mainstream media seemed bias to promote the doctors's interest using concern for rising healthcare cost as excuse. That is far from the truth.
Some of the Malay social media are using the chinese bogey by claiming chinese monopolised the pharmaceutical industry. Hmmm ... isn't it foreign pharmaceutical companies?
With the doctors are campaigning hard and the Malaysian Medical Association (or MMA) being a powerful and influential group that could dictate public health policies, the pharmacist are a seriously disadvantaged lot.
The plight of pharmacist as professional in the medical field seemed not given the space to speak thus we emphatise with them. They are professionals and should not be reduced to cashiers at pharmacies.
For someone on regular medication and regularly hospitalised, we can relate to the pharmacist side of the story.
Our experience made us believe that doctors should not takeover the role of pharmacists.
Our respirologist prescribed for our COPD problem with something like 8 or 9 types of medicines and inhalers at one time. A friend realised this and told us that it is strange. We will end up immuned to medicine that there will be no medicine when our condition escalate.
For his much worse asthma condition, he was limited to few medications.
During Haj, a pharmacist at the Tabung Haji makeshift hospital alerted us that most of the medicine prescribed were duplication. Without saying it, she inferred that we were overdosed and prescribed unnecessary steroids yet the cough never subsided.
It was in one occasion of an asthma attack over Hari Raya that we switched specialist at another hospital. Finally, he was able to address the incessant cough of many years. All that was needed was one regular Symbicort inhaler and in the event of attack, only a Ventolin inhaler and a type of pill.
We realised that not only we were overdosed, we were wrongly prescribed over the past few years.
So doctors should not be dispensing medicine because the pharmacist is more qualified for this role. And, Doctors have limited knowledge on drugs, chemical content of medicine, side effects, and issue of safety.
Pharmacist must be involved in curing patience. As per our experience, they could reduce mistakes and side effects of wrong prescription of medicine.
The reason private clinic doctors were allowed to dispense medicine and encroach into the area of pharmacist must be the situation of insufficient number of pharmacists of the time.
That ratio is now down to 1:2,400. WHO requirement is 1:2,000. By 2020, it will be 1:1,600 so it is high time.
As we believe, there is also the consideration to keep cost of private sector health cost low by doctor's consultancy in private clinic being partly subsidised by medicine sale.
It is no more the case today as doctors are not not only taking percentage profit on top of the supplier's cost but selling it at few multiples of the supplier's cost.
It reminded me of late father's ulcer medicine. The doctor had accidently left the original package with the brand name of the medicine. Father made the effort to compare prices and he found out that the doctor had charged three times the pharmacy price.
There was an incident that we got a clinic to issue a note to get a particular medicine from the next door pharmacy. For only RM8 for the doctor's note, we were able to reuse the note and buy medicine at the pharmacy for 30 to 40% lower than that charged at doctor's clinic.
This procedure was a way for doctor's to take a ride on the lower medicine cost at pharmacy. By right, it should be left to the pharmacy to do so.
Demarking the line between medical consultancy and dispensing medicine should bring about lower cost for medication, and more advantageous to patients and consumers.
Doctor role would be to diagnose and recommend the medicine but it is the pharmacy that authorise the dispensing medicine to ensure safety. This way there is counter checking of a professional by other qualified professional.
By separating dispensing role from doctors, the pharmacist profession can flourish and grow like mushroom throughout the country. It is time that we have a more professional and dynamic public healthcare system like in other developed country.
For too long, pharmacist have been reduced to sales person at pharmacy.
In government hospitals, one will notice pharmacist playing their role and explaining the medicine prescribed to patients. Doctors will follow the medicine prescribed by pharmacist.
Malaysia has been recognised by world health organisation as having one of the best health system because of the government facilities. It is well planned as it covers for rural and urban population.
The government hospital have been practising the separation between diagnosing by doctors and dispensing of medicine. Why can't that model be applied to private clinics?
It is the private clinics that is resisting the separation of diagnosis and resisting the change because private health practise have turned these healthcare professional tending to the sick into heartless businessmen.
These clinics have been shortchanging consumers and put patients in danger by hiring unqualified assistants to handle medicine.
It is also time that healthcare consumers at private healthcare institution be given itemised bill. They should know the cost of their medicine and able to compare prices. There should not be any more hiding of brand and package from patients as happened to late father.
Maybe it is time to do away with these small neighbourhood clinics with limited role which only contribute to rising healthcare cost.

Doctors prescribe medicines, it's their job to learn about drugs. Always. Keeping up to date via journals and seminars and such. They don't just recommend, the prescription is part of the treatment and they are liable for it.
I think what you're trying to say is that private clinics should not be acting as pharmacies as well, if they don't have the actual pharmacists.
Well, minus the sideline from dispensing medicines, I guess the people should get used to paying doctors just for consultancy fees and then buying the medicines themselves from pharmacies. More freedom of choice, but more hassle too.
In Indonesia, they already have this system. Sometimes, it's the pharmacy that employs doctors instead of the other way around. Pharmacists are able to dispense certain medicines only if there is a doctor prescription. You can use a doctor's prescription to buy those medicines in any pharmacy that happens to stock them. The prescription always has the doctor's name, practice, phone number and his registration number. They're not just any notes, they're a legal requirement.
There is even a specific way of writing the prescription down that both doctors and pharmacists use and understand. They may use generic or specific brands, sometimes certain doctors may even give special recipes that is prepared a certain way by the pharmacist.
With the current practice, patients are forced to take whatever medicines the doctor prescribe without having the chance of consulting pharmacists and buying the option that suits them, for example financially by buying cheaper generics.
So I agree that the current practice needs to change. Seems like there are also other problems regarding prescribing of drugs with doctors here as well.
What I don't agree is changing it in order to get votes. Doctors being the wealthier, always make better lobbyists. You're gonna lose if that's how you choose to play.
What you are saying is full of lies and embellishments. Your real motive is this;
" By separating dispensing role from doctors, the pharmacist profession can flourish and grow like mushroom throughout the country. It is time that we have a more professional and dynamic public healthcare system like in other developed country." From your own words. Not concern for other people, but your pockets.
You said for safety, but my relatives were sold dangerous items from pharmacies without doctor's prescription.
If you want to be doctors, go to medical schools.
As a pharmacist, mohon izin kongsikan pandangan bernas saudara. Terima kasih kerana memahami dilema kami
Anon 6:41
You wanna deal with drugs and medicine, dont go to medical school/
Take up pharmacy.
One incident at a pharmacy does not substantiate the over charging private clinincs have been imposing on concumers.
To accuse the bloggers as lies and full of embellishments only reflect your refusal to face fact and hide the reality from consumers.
You must be a money minded doctor
Obviously doctors and pharmacists are only in for the money!
Why not appoint a consultant to advise the patient to decide on whether to use which? At a 10% fee of course.
My relatives died because of doctors mistake. If u want to do pharmacist's job, go to pharmacy school.
Hi! just so u know, first, that was a wrong poster u put up there. we had updated a newer one. MDC did not coorganised the event with us and it was supposed to be Dispensing Separation. Second, we did request for input of questions and response that will help the dialogue from the pharmacists yang cancelled but.........
Anyway, Puteri UMNO tried our very best to engage with the pharmacists for this dialogue. Unfortunately the 2 speakers ( En. Amrahi Buang and one of your academicians ) cancelled at the very last minute due to reason tak mahu memburukkan keadaan yang sedia tegang and because the possibilities of people hijacking the event and causing riot ( hmmmm...! ) Fortunately your students turned up and guess what? They were superb! One of the girls spoke very well and shed some lights to us. we were very impressed, Puteri and the doctors!
We want to hear more from the pharmacist and the doctors, hence the dialog. we want the rakyat to hear the info "first hand" and not just wondering and making speculations why in the world this 2 professions gaduh gaduh sana sini in media. i lived in Ireland before where they used ds and i liked it! But we just wanted to know the pros and cons implementing it in Malaysia. Those who attended the dialog yesterday would know there was joke that Puteri pro DS but yet those who opposed came! Of course we appreciate the concern from ur higher level authority about the risk of unwanted event. We took precautions! Puteri was willing to take the risk and so did the doctors. But why didn't the pharmacies. This is not about the vote per se. We genuinely wanted to educate the rakyat, to instill budaya pemikir dalam diri rakyat Malaysia. Even after the dialog yesterday, we advised to get more info, read up and WAIT for the official announcement calmly. A simple sharing session was all we wanted from all parties so that the rakyat get a basic understanding about DS as well as to clear the misconception about DS and the "war" between the 2 professions. Was that too much to ask? any indication Puteri being "bought" by the Doctors? We will continue to engage with all parties for the benefit of all but at the end of the day...yes, the vote is yours. - EXCO PUTERI UMNO MALAYSIA
dont go to GP's unless y got a lot of money n ur in a hurry. better go to gov clinics. jimat. not all GP's are money orientated. but many of them are.
Read this to hear the other side.
So u want our healthcare system to follow as what the Indonesian is doing ?? Mind you, our healthcare standard is much better than the Indonesian which has become hay wire so as India and Korea who did DS without proper study.
My late grandmother was prescribed medicine to lower her blood pressure, and some strong painkillers after a urinary tract infection (if I'm not mistaken). After several incidences of her falling, a pharmacist reviewed all her medication and realised that she was being given multiple different anti-hypertensives from different doctors which made her blood pressure too low.
To this day, I believe that because of the unnecessarily strong painkillers which my family did not realise my grandmother was being fed, my late grandmother was never quite the same - she was there but she was just a shell of her former self. The overlapping and unnecessary medicines were stopped but she never really recovered.
Please, please work together for the safety of your patients. Who knows how many people out there experience the same thing?
In the western world..big pharma is a dominant entity influencing plotics. If having docs and pharmacy services separated mk things better..the west didnt really help the consumers or pts..as the cost was still prohibitive and they still hv bloating cost of medicare
The pharma claimed doc is just making profits. The docs said pharma is actually wanting to do that. The pharma controls behaviour or market behaviour of pharmacist..in that they can potentially enforce buying of branded meications which are extremely expensive. So both had issues. But i tend to believe the pharma entity would like to hv a strong foothold on the market so that they can eventually monopolise the industry
Why? Because the current system work well, although not perfect in isokated cases. There is no need to force on docs or pts to adopt what they think is right, if their suggestion is way better and more beneficial to the cutizens. The (open) market can decide on that. Let the citizens decide which clinic they want to go..the one with only doc or the one with doc and pharmacy counter.
It is crucial that the politicians are not bought by any parties on this issue..and the best solution us to let both system being implemented ..and doc/pharmacist must compete fairly and openly ..if any party wish to monopolise and refuse an open market..i say to them..take a hike!
I wonder why all of sudden the doctors are concerned about patients convenience. You don't even respect us even when we pay consultation fees. Now u should start to have some respect for us since u have realised the reason behind your rice pot
The pharmacist have yet to make anything and already they are being levelled as money minded.
This must be doctors trying to make villains out of innocent pharmacist when in fact the crooked ones are doctors!
I am only concerned with having the dispensing of our medicine be done professionally, comprehensively and safely so that the risk of having the cases mentioned are avoided.
Both can make their fair share of living but not by oppressing the consumers as being unethically done by many doctors!!!
The experience is japan shows cost of drugs to consumers decreasing. Read:
Korean experience showed reduced in abuses by both doctors and pharmacists as well promoted healthy competition from the transparency and encourage R&D.
Read
The study by consumer association of penang support the popularly held believe that dispensing by pharmacy is more economical:
Doctors should stop resisting this change and be selfish. It deny their family annual ski holiday in switzerland but help the mass rakyat.
Is this the only 'contribution' by Puteri UMNO. I have not heard of any real constructive contribution from them.By the way,it doesn't matter about the vote of Pharmacist as most of them are chinese and we know where their vote will go to no matter what we say.A chinese business can prosper in a malay area but a malay business can never survive in a chinese area. They are just damn racist!
Increase of uric acid is due to proteins unable to be digested and thus released into the bloodstream. To counter this take more pineapples which has enzymes to convert the protein into harmless waste.
Seriously, the big pharma spends money on BOTH doctors and pharmacists for promoting their products even with the system now.
All those medicines, both doctors and pharmacists get them from pharmaceutical companies.
Difference is, when you go to pharmacies for example to buy some off the counter medication, you could choose what you want. You could compare prices, ask the pharmacist, because, hell, it's the pharmacist, it's his freaking job. Compare with when you go to the doctor. How many of you even thought of asking the doctor to switch to some other medicine, or even ask about the taking of, the precautions and such?You only know when you get whatever is dispensed by whoever doing the dispensing in that clinic. It boggles my mind people would want to still stick to this kind of standard.
Have you ever realized that the pharma companies could have their sales people giving incentives to doctors to prescribe their brand instead of others?This actually happens. It's not even considered bribery. No wonder some of you even tell stories of patients being over prescribed. Gee, I wonder why.
One thing you need to understand, doctors have varying skill levels. Some of them might not even be real doctors and you wouldn't even know it. The real doctors have been educated in different countries. For example you might think the UK educated ones would be better, but have they the more experience in treating dengue compared to a locally educated one?Errors, even fatal errors could always happen. This could be lessened with identifying what is wrong, and making rules that address it that health practitioners need to abide to. For example, making rules that pharmacies are not allowed to sell dangerous medicines without a prescription, or making sure that doctors ask whether their patients have drug allergies, or have been taking other medicines before seeing them.
About doctors making money, well, no shit Sherlock. Medical school is not cheap. You can go to government funded(what makes them cheap for you) public hospitals and drive up the workload of government hospital doctors, with their kind of pay I wouldn't be surprised if most of them get into private practice as soon as they can. Some even would risk the fine of violating their JPA loan/scholarship, the senior ones who also teach in the government funded universities would also find private hospitals and universities more attractive to practice in.
Local universities have been offering pharmacy courses, besides other allied health courses, for a long time already. By now we should have a pool of pharmacists, who should be allowed to do what they are supposed to do, instead of having doctors trying to fill the same role and profiting off it. Yeah, they certainly make money off it.
Implementing this means they ave to rely more on consultancy fees.
So does the pharmacist, it's their freaking livelihood! You don't want pharmacists and want doctors doing the dispensing, don't train pharmacists.
I don't know how people gets the impression pharmacists will be doing doctor's job, they're supposed to work together and complement each other!Just like with nurses, radiographers, lab technicians, therapists, a whole lot of people working within the health industry!It's not just doctors!
Well, if you want to say Malaysia is a third rate country unable to implement this properly and better off stagnant with how the old things are run, eh, why not, wouldn't want to argue.
Maybe you are right.
Maybe GST also sucks and Malaysians simply are not prepared and won't be able to handle GST as well.
If doctors really care about patient convenience they should allow pharmacists to operate in their clinics without working for the doctor.
Yes, make it like that, especially in urban areas.
Only doctors who operate in rural and other areas that lack pharmacists be able to dispense and sell medicines.
DS is already implemented in government hospitals. It's in private doctors sector where they diagnose disease and then sell medicines to treat the disease they diagnose.
I guess the healthcare standard for government hospitals must be bad and haywire like Indonesia, since DS already exist in government hospitals.
No, no no. Doctors know about the ailments as they are the only ones qualified and experienced to diagnose and, based on that, prescribe.
Pharmacists don't. They can't. They know only the general uses of the medicines.
But if anyone wants to buy from pharmacies, stating their medical complaint, yes, the pharmacists must be allowed to "sell" - not "prescribe", as only doctors can do that.
Panadol is basically a pain killer but has been used for all sorts of medical complaints. Until the Health Ministry did a crackdown (? or was it just a blistering attack) on the over-prescription of the use of panadol recently.
Me? Slight headaches and rheumatic pains, I'll just take panadol. But if I have flu that doesn't clear after 3 days, I go to the doctor, not the pharmacist for alternative medicine, man.
Let doctors sell the medicines that they prescribe. Nothing wrong with that. They are professionals and must want their patients recover quickly and therefore not likely to do hanky panky.
After all, pharmacies can sell non-medical products to increase their revenue. Doctors can't even sell herbal remedies, can they?
Dear Puteri-Puteri UMNO.
Append herewith some information for the Rakyat on the issue of Dispensing Separation:
Hope you will circulate this to your members and the public too.
Dispensing Separation - Information for the Rakyat:
1. Medicine Dispensing is NEVER the duty of medical doctors because they are not FORMALLY trained or qualified in this subject. There is no justification to delay the implementation of the prescribing and dispensing functions for doctors and pharmacists in Malaysia, unlike in the government sector where doctors are prescribing and pharmacists are dispensing for the full safeguard and the utilization of the pharmacists training and knowledge towards optimizing of the public health. Likewise the doctors and Specialists in private hospitals and health-institutions are already working towards the maximum benefit of the patients under the system of dispensing separation. Why are pharmacists in the private sector community pharmacy practice continued not to be treated the same especially when the Health Ministry has no hesitation to upgrade and expand the various specialties and services of the same profession in the government service to almost full intake to saturation? Why the double standards?
2. We do not quite understand what some people mean when they said “when we separate the dispensing, that’s when the patient’s rights will be robbed”? Have they forgotten what their MMA had promised when they had signed the Patient charter in the 1980s? On the contrary the patient’s right to prescription screening, medication counselling and advice will be restored. With due respect, please note that just because doctors have learn a bit of pharmacology plus the human anatomy as one subject in their MBBS degree course it does not mean doctors are very well versed or trained to do the work of a pharmacist. Pharmacologists spent several years learning pharmacology but they are not allowed to prescribe or dispense medicines unless they are clinical pharmacologists (i.e. they are also doctors) right?
The pharmacists too are trained in clinical pharmacy where they also learned about diseases, symptoms and treatment. They also learn in the clinical ward rounds but all these do not mean they can do all the work of the doctor’s right? Pharmacists and Doctors are two distinct and different professions. One does not want an accountant to do the work of an auditor or an engineer to perform as an architect and vice-versa right? It is only right that a very ill person should see their doctor first. However after seeing the doctor they should be sending their patient with a prescription to the pharmacist and not get their untrained and unqualified clinic assistants to dish out the medications to their patients without proper screening, checking and medication counselling.
Pharmacists are the only professionals who are formally trained and professionally qualified and recognised in medicine dispensing. Doctors only have some lectures on pharmacology (i.e. the subject that deal with the effects of medicines in the body) in one year of their 5 year medicine course while the pharmacists are trained in ALL aspect of medicines, starting right from the formulation, production, indications (the right usage), dosages, monitoring of side and adverse effects, remedial actions in cases of overdosage or toxicity. Other than Pharmacology which the pharmacists study in depth over their four years pharmacy course, the pharmacists are taught subjects like Pharmaceutics & Dispensing, Pharmaceutical Technology, Pharmacotherapy, Pharmacodynamics, Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacognosy, Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Pharmaco Economics, Medication Therapy Review, Medication Counselling, Patient Medication Monitoring, Pathophysiology and last but not least Clinical Pharmacy. Not to mention that Pharmacists need to be in possession of a Poison License (renewable yearly) to be able to dispense and one of the conditions to qualify for this Poison License, pharmacists have to pass the Forensic Exams. This, i.e. to pass the Forensic Exam and to be in possession of a poison license, the dispensing doctors have the privilege of not having to go through.
Medicine Dispensing appears ‘easy from what a patient can see’, but it involves pharmacists’ mind (that works rapidly) to screen every dispensed drug against any possible ‘drug-drug interactions’, drug-food interactions, drug-substances incompatibility, correct doses, and right indications etc. before the medicines are given to the patients. It is not just the physical act of dishing out the medicines to the patients. As it is, in Malaysia many clinic assistants are dishing out the medicines without even the proper labeling of the medications been supplied and this include omitting the names of the medicines that had been supplied. For your information, under our current Poison Act 1952 (Controlled Medicines Act) all controlled medicines are required to be labelled with the name of the patient, name of the medicines, dosage instructions etc.
3. Private Doctors are qualified in the diagnosis of various diseases, and it is necessary for them to do what they had been trained and qualified to do and that is to diagnose and prescribe. It is never in the patients’ interests for private doctors to dispense drugs.
4. For those private medical doctors who are afraid of the new Healthcare Plan, we feel they need to go back to the basics in their medical studies. More CME will prepare them to serve the patients better and they will enjoy their work as respected Clinicians. All the registered pharmacists want is to complement the Professional Role of Clinicians but not the Dispenser-Doctors role! The TIME Has Come For A CHANGE, and ‘Change We Must’.
5. ‘Dispensing Separation’ will be for the Patients benefits. It is not true that the patients Will Pay More unless the doctor charges the Rakyat more for the consultation which some had already threatened to do so. This threat the rakyat do not have to worry for reasons of competition. Those private doctors who increase their consultation fees will soon have to close down as more and more doctors set up their clinics (the country is overproducing doctors and pharmacists). MPCAM had itself admitted that many clinics had closed down because of the stiff competition amongst the private clinics. Moreover why should the people be subjected to such threats which is akin to blackmailing or holding the rakyat to ransom.
6. With D.S, the patients’ medications prescribed by their Doctors will be double checked by professionally trained pharmacists and any medication problem or prescription error will be rectified before the medications are dispensed to the patients. The patients will be given the necessary information when they receive their medications. They will be alerted on possible side effects and be provided with advice on how to counteract or minimise any of these side effects if it do happen. In addition, patients will be informed on the best way and time to take their medications, to maximise the efficacy and minimise the side effects. Moreover the patients will be able to discuss with their pharmacists on any other issues related to their medications..
10. We believe most of the doctors had worked in the Government General Hospitals before (this writer had been a pharmacist in Government Hospitals for 33 years). To recapitulate in the event that some of these doctors had forgotten or chose to forget, in most Government Hospitals there are:
a) The Drug Information Service (D.I.S) and this D.I.S is one of the busiest units within the Pharmacy. The clients that are using this D.I.S are mostly doctors who require information not only on what are the most appropriate medicine to use but also on other info like the proper indications, time of administration, appropriate dosing, side & adverse drug reactions to look out for and in the event of wrong prescribing/overdosing what remedial measures are required.
b) Medication Therapy Adherence Clinics (M.T.A.C) manned by pharmacists had been set up in many government hospitals. These M.T.A.C s operate side by side with the doctors clinics in the specislt clinics of the hospitals. At these clinics, patients who are on long term medication therapy are referred to the pharmacists manning the MTAC for the required drug and medication counselling. The Pharmacists Medication Therapy Adherence Clinics (M.T.A.C) are very much in demand as the doctors want the pharmacist’s intervention to see better compliance to medications. Better compliance to medication lead to better outcomes. This I am speaking from my own personal experience after having been the Chief Pharmacist in Government General Hospitals for more than half of my 33 years in government service. Government doctors and specialists have no qualms working together with pharmacists not only in the MTAC but also in many other areas with many other health care professionals to provide the best healthcare for the patients
c) The Medication Counselling Service that are being carried out in the outpatient pharmacy department and the bedside medication counselling service in the wards for the past decades or so had assisted to improve patients medicines compliance after discharged. The pharmacists are also a part of the Hospital Home Visit Team. This Home Monitoring of the patients are mostly been done for the very severe or very under privileged group of patients.
d) Pharmacists, dieticians, physiotherapists and other healthcare professionals had been working very closely with doctors as members of the healthcare team to provide a comprehensive healthcare in the hospitals and other health institutions. In these government hospitals and the other healthcare institutions, the doctors, including all the Consultant Specialists have no hesitation to seek the pharmacist’s professional advice when it comes to medications. What we do not understand nor comprehend is why when some of these doctors quit government service and go into private practice, suddenly the pharmacist’s services are no longer of use to them or to the patients?
e) The government and the doctors in government hospitals and healthcare facilities know and acknowledge that the patients can benefit greatly from the practice of pharmacy and that is why the doctors in these health institutions are more than willing to work together with pharmacists for the benefits of the patients and not for the benefits of any sector of the health professionals.
The government has the facts and figures on the number of fatal prescribing errors like wrong dosages, inappropriate/irrational or excessive prescribing, drug-drug interaction, drug-food/herbs/supplements interactions. The numbers of the pharmacists intervention on these errors prior to dispensing to the patients are also documented. These data are collected from both the government outpatient and inpatient pharmacies as part and parcel of the Ministry of Health’s Quality Control Program (QAP) to ensure medication safety to patients are been maintained. The general members of the public may not be aware that these pharmacists are working quietly behind the counters to ensure medications safety for the patients. These data can be only be collected in settings where there are dispensing separation, i.e where the doctors prescribe and the pharmacists screen before dispensing to the patients.
f) The allegations by some doctors that dispensing in government hospitals and clinics are not been carried out by pharmacists only showed how ignorant and outdated some of these doctors are as to the progress that the government pharmacy practices had made since the 1970s, not to mention the grave injustice that they had committed against the government pharmacists who had been diligently providing the best pharmaceutical care to the rakyat.
11. There is no provision in the Poison Act for the private clinic doctors to delegate the dispensing in the clinic to other qualified personnel. In short the "dispensing" doctor/s is required to supply the medicines personally to their own patients. Is this been practised in most private clinics? FYI dispensing in government hospitals ARE DONE by pharmacists. And in the Community pharmacies dispensing are also been carried out by the pharmacists and/or under the personal supervision of the pharmacist (and this is provided for under the Poison Act.). There may be some black sheep pharmacist who may not be around when dispensing are been carried out. For these black sheep pharmacists, please REPORT to the authorities. Similarly for those black sheep pharmacists who diagnose and prescribe Group B poisons please report to the authorities. We do not CONDONE such practices of these pharmacists.
12. Some doctors are frank enough to admit that in the final analysis it’s the money that counts for their practice to be viable. However we hope all healthcare professionals will always be mindful that we as professionals, we should be earning the money in the professional way, always taking into consideration the people’s welfare first. Healthcare professionals should never behave like an ordinary lay businessman!
Perhaps we should all listen to what the late Dr. Richard Teo has to say at.
Quote Dr. Richard’s own words: ”
That is another good reason why the patients need pharmacist to be their check and balance. If the doctor is both the prescriber and the dispenser, who will act as their screener to ensure that the medications given to the patients are correct in all aspects, for their health?
13. In the current discussions some private practitioners had been portraying the picture that ALL Medicines require a doctor prescription and had accused Pharmacists of selling medicines without prescriptions from the doctors!
For the information of the Rakyat, in our country, medicines are classified into Group B, C and others. Many medications including the various cough & cold remedies, creams & Ointments, eye drops, medicines for diabetes, asthma, painkillers, etc. etc. are under Group C classifications. Group C medicines are medicines which pharmacists can supply without doctors prescriptions. For Group B medicines, one needs a prescription to be dispensed by the pharmacists. But without Dispensing Separation, community pharmacists in Malaysia do not receive many direct prescriptions from the private clinics doctors. No pharmacy or pharmacist can hope to sell any group B medicines to any walk in patients like “kacang-puteh”.
At one meeting a senior MOH officer had stated that our Country Group C lists appear very limited compared to those that they see in the developed countries. In any case in the developed world more and more medicines are been allowed to be prescribed by the pharmacists. In several countries like the US, pharmacists are allowed to prescribe many of these Group B medicines without the need of doctors. In the U.K, they had even allowed physiotherapists to prescribe certain group B analgesics. Is there a difference how we are trained, those employed in the service and those of us in the community pharmacy? Is there an inadequacy in our pharmacy training – accredited by these countries – that we are deemed as worse than the physiotherapists in UK?
In any case doctors do not have the sole prerogative in prescribing. More than halve of all the medicinal products that are registered in Malaysia are classified as “Non Poisons”, i.e. these medicines are not under the “Controlled Medicines” group. Pharmacists are legally allowed to prescribe and supply those Group C poisons (in some other countries these are called “Pharmacy Items” and the many other OTC or Non Controlled Medicines categories of medicinal products. The traditional practitioners are allowed to prescribe these non-controlled medicines. In fact any uncles, aunties, grandfathers or grandmothers can and have been “prescribing” these non-controlled medicinal items since time memorable!
14. Several private clinic doctors too had objected to pharmacists conducting blood sugar level and blood pressure measurements with those home monitoring devices. There is absolutely nothing wrong with pharmacists performing blood tests using those home monitoring medical devices. Non doctors like nurses, medical assistants and laboratory technicians had been conducting all these measurements in hospitals as part of their work to screen the patients before the patients see their doctor in the hospitals or clinics. Government doctors in the hospitals and clinics are encouraging patients to monitor their own health parameters like blood sugar levels and blood pressure. Are the private clinics doctors also saying that the patients who are using these home monitoring devices to monitor these important health parameters are also guilty of "playing doctor"? The Pathology Lab had also not disallowed pharmacies to carry out such measurements with the home monitoring devices. Are the private clinic doctors ignorant of these as well? Haven these private clinic doctors NOT read those news report on the high percentage of our population been walking time bombs as they are not aware that they are having high blood pressure and/or high blood sugar levels? One typical news report on this matter is “The Star” Headline report on the 28th Feb 2015 at
Al healthcare professionals are encouraged to assist in the screening of our rakyat for early detection of these two most frequent non communicable diseases. And again pharmacies are the most accessible and most affordable health facilities for patients to seek the assistance of a health professional to monitor their health parameters. Thus instead of trying to portray the pharmacies as doing something very wrong with their assistance to monitor these important health parameters, private doctors should be encouraging the pharmacies to work harder and to have a larger section of the population to be screened. Many community pharmacists had been doing such screening and had referred several cases of their patients which had readings that are out of the normal accepted range to the private doctors clinics for a more thorough investigation and treatment.
15. These days more and more educated and the well informed members of the public are seeking the services of the pharmacies, not only in the government health facilities but also the services of the pharmacists in the private sector.
This perhaps explain why “smart” self-paying private patients without medical coverage prefers to get a prescription (especially from private hospitals with dispensing separated administration) and have it dispensed from a pharmacy. They have a choice to hop from pharmacy to pharmacy in an open market for the best price; or to request for much cheaper generic equivalent registered with Ministry of Health. Even as victims to discriminatory price inducement, the open free market competition would force upon pharmacies to yield away most of their margins; more often, they make less than the standard price-off (>20%); to a greater part by the proliferation of the illegal “runner-sourced” goods originated from the same sole distributors selectively promoted by the principles and sold to/through favoured practices or outlets. We believe many of these principle-companies justify these inducement acts on the basis of group B medicines for doctors only; hence the people have to pay (without choice or contest?).
No 16. Malaysia has one of the best healthcare systems in the world. So why the need to change?
The positive ranking that the World Health organization (W.H.O) has given Malaysia is due to our healthcare delivery system by the PUBLIC Sector and not the Private Clinic Sector. The rankings are based on an index of five factors — health, health equality, responsiveness, responsiveness equality, and fair financial contribution.. The Doctors associations like MMA and MPCAM attempts to attribute Malaysia’s good ranking to the Doctor Dispensing system in our country is indeed very pathetic and misleading. In any case please take note that a large majority of the countries with rankings which are better than Malaysia had been practicing Dispensing Separation for a long time (Kindly refer to )
If at all anyone would like to know what the W.H.O thinks of dispensing doctors, please refer to Section 10 of the W.H.O report at
That World Health Organization paper on Policy Perspectives on Medicines had listed 'perverse financial incentives' as one reason why 'worldwide more than 50 per cent of all medicines are prescribed, dispensed or sold inappropriately'. It found that 'prescribers who earn money from the sale of medicines prescribe more medicines, and more expensive medicines, than prescribers who do not…'
Another W.H.O report had stated that ”Drugs cannot be viewed as ordinary commodities of commerce as they are not like most other commodities. Drugs are not chosen directly by the buyer (the patient), the buyer is not always the responsible payer, and the buyer often has no background or the necessary information to evaluate or make a choice which can have hazardous or even deadly consequences for the patient….”.
17. Some would probably be demanding for proofs on what we had mentioned about the inducements of medical prescribers by the unethical drug companies. Let us highlight the example of Panadol 650mg to clearly illustrate this discriminatory practice that is widely practiced by most drug companies in Malaysia.
PANADOL 650mg is also a very good example to highlight on how many drug companies in Malaysia had short changed the people of Malaysia. For your information, prior to 2012, GSK only make their PANADOL 650mg to private clinics.
In 2011 PANADOL 650mg had been sold to private clinics at prices ranging from RM3.84 to RM7.16 per box of 80 Caplets (i.e. the clinic cost price of the PANADOL 650mg was less than 9 cents per Caplet.
PANADOL 650mg was NOT available to any pharmacies and pharmacies can only purchase their Panadol 500mg Tablet at about RM2.15 per strip of 10 Tablets, i.e. the cost price of the Panadol 500mg for pharmacies was at 21 sen per Tablet.
In 2011 the Panadol 650mg regular price for private clinics was at RM7.16 per pack of 80 Caplets (i.e. at 9 sen per caplet) with bonus 8+1 (meaning buy 8 packs get 1 pack f.o.c) which will bring the cost to about 8 sen per caplet. There will be the usual occasional promotion where the private clinics are encouraged to purchase bigger lots at very much discounted price, like the promotion in late 2011 where the PANADOL 650mg was offered to the private clinics at RM3.84 per pack of 80 caplets but the private clinics have to purchase 80 packs of 80 caplets and 10 packs will be given f.o.c. The price after this 80+10 bonus offer at RM3.84 will bring down the cost of the PANADOL Caplet to less than 5 sen per Caplet!
Then in 2013, after our official complaint to the GSK Headquarters in the United Kingdom and also to the Malaysian Competition Commission GSK decided to make the PANADOL 650mg to Pharmacies but at RM26.67 per pack of 80 Caplets i.e. at 33.33 sen per Caplet compared to the regular Doctor’s price of 8 to 9 sen per Caplet! The Recommended Selling Price (RSP) was fixed at RM32.00 per pack of 80 Caplets or 40 sen per Caplet.
In summary, pharmacies have to pay about 33sen one Caplet of the Panadol 650mg while clinics pay only 8-9 sen for 1 Caplet of the Panadol 650mg! With the RSP set at 40 sen per Caplet by GSK, the margin for pharmacies was fixed at maximum of 7 sen per Caplet while the maximum margin for clinics vary from 31 to 35 sen per Caplet (depending on their quantities purchased). Kindly see the attached files for copies of the relevant documents related to GSK Unethical practices. Please take note that GSK may have adjusted their prices after 2012.
Now if that Panadol 650mg was also available to pharmacies at 8 to 9 sen per Caplet, then the rakyat will be able to buy the Panadol 650mg at less than 15 cents per tablet of the Panadol 650mg, compared to the 25 cents that they are paying for the Panadol 500mg! Why should drug companies want to deny the public an equitable access to more affordable medicines if not because they want to induce the prescribers to use more of their products.
Last but not least lest you think that the Panadol case is just an isolated case do see what several articles on these unethical practices of drug companies. You may say that “all these are also happening in other countries so what is the big deal”? The difference is that in all the other countries, the authorities are at least doing something to address this issue or at least to punish those errant countries unlike in Malaysia no actions had been taken against these errant drug companies.

Malaysian Pharmacist
On Behalf of “Say No to inducement of medical prescribers Facebook" group:
as a layman, do you think the common people like me would go out to buy medications in a pharmacy after getting prescription from a doctor while i am sick?
i have seen people buying medications in pharmacy and that poor fellow developed allergic reaction.
Anon 1.01, 1.28 and 7.22
Get an education first before giving an opinion!!!!!
So in the process of going forward with this pharmacy bill do you doctors and pharmacists just argue with each other or do any of your associations even bother to inform and also ask the common people what do they want?
Or are the common people deemed uneducated and their opinions and wishes worthless and irrelevant?
Maybe the common people should just better seek alternative and complementary medicines instead.
11:49 PM,
Looks like you not only need an education on the right to dissent, but also medication of the psychotic kind.
Pity.
11:49,
You sound like a Red Bean. Blurting out a few words of condemnation without any explanation. No upbringing, eh>
Be civil, man. Learn to argue. Put out your reasoning. Otherwise people will call you stupid. And the High Court has recently ruled that the words stupid and recalcitrant are not defamatory.
2:41 AM,
Seems to me that the arguments on dishonesty, cheating, profit motive etc apply to both - the medical clinic doctors as well as the privately practising pharmacists.
And I'd warn the 11:49 bloke that if he insults me for expressing an opinion, I have a host of insults to throw back at him.
And if this blog allows his comment, it's only fair that the responses be allowed, too.
Ladies & Gentlemen, It is not the pharmacists who want to rob the hard-working doctors of their right to dispense medicine. It is the manipulative Chinese tycoons with chains of shops waiting to open up pharmacies at the expense of the 10,000 doctors. Our beloved Malaysia has the best medical care in the World for decades. Why should the doctors' rights give way to one or two tycoons ? Do not bully the poor doctors using the innocent pharmascists as an excuse. It is the TYCOONS.
Ladies & Gentlemen, It is the greedy Chinese tycoons with chains of shops who want to rob the 10,000 doctors of their rights. Not the pharmacist. This is as clear as daylight.Costs of medicines will increase for the Rakyat if the tycoons succeed.
Appears to me that the problem the doctors side choose to bring up over the pharmacy bill doesn't attack privately practising pharmacists. I think most pharmacists end up employed to somebody else anyway instead of actually owning and practising in their own pharmacies. Is this true or not?I don't know how many people here are doctors, pharmacists or just normal people(like me). There's a pharmacist up there, but his comment only hinted that the current system is unfair to them. They really need to speak up.
Rather there are allegations made that some unscrupulous businessmen are moving towards a monopoly on the pharmacy retail business, buying up small pharmacies and spending money to push the bill. Don't know if it's true or not. Ugly fight and me as ordinary citizen don't get the impression that any side even care to get feedback from ordinary people.
Not surprised, the bill is actually protected under OSA. Heard some doctors were mad they couldn't bring it back home to read or something recently.
Feels refreshing to have an opinion from somebody in the medical field that is neutral.
Additional notes for the Rakyat.
We hope to inform the public that we cannot allow 3rd level healthcare to continue when we have these fine pharmacy graduates already trained to provide healthcare delivery which will be safer, more effective and towards a system that will be more cost effective compared to now where the doctors can do what they want without counterchecks on whether they are giving the correct or best medicine at the correct dose for the correct duration and whether multiple medicines they prescribe in on prescription are really necessary or whether these medicines could interact and eventually result in a bad reaction or poor ineffective treatment for the patient. As long as there is no check and balance and one party is doing all the 3 functions :diagnosis, prescription and dispensing, the final outcome of the treatment; whether it is effective or the opposite, no one knows. Is this what the patients want?
For the information of your members please take note that the Government (i.e B.N) had determined the training models of pharmacists and doctors where the curricula were set by the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Education long time back, where the system of check and balance for the safety of patients and also to promote the optimal outcome of any treatment is the aim.
Our curriculum in medicine trains the doctor for diagnosis and treatment, while that in Pharmacy the curriculum was aimed to trains the graduate to check prescriptions & to look out for errors, to check on drug combinations and contraindications, effective dosing and also on the individual characteristics of patients, their health status, their lifestyle, their concurrent intake of foods/herbs/supplements which can impact on the outcome of the medicines prescribed. All these concerns are questions the pharmacists consider when they screen a prescription and counsel the patient during dispensing.
These roles of the doctor and the pharmacists were planned by the Government when these medical and pharmacy curricula were adopted. Today 19 universities with pharmacy schools are training pharmacists to do these separate roles for the delivery of first world healthcare for Malaysia.
We now have 13,000 registered pharmacists. Much of the problems we are facing today is related to this dichotomy, where training of these professionals are at the level of 1st world and delivery of service in the private sector is still at the 3rd world level, where the doctors still want to diagnose, prescribe and “dispense” (often through an untrained assistants). The original aim of “check and balance” on the medications in the prescriptions for the patients is non-existent. This practice back in 1970s was acceptable because at that period of time we only had 1 pharmacy school graduating pharmacists.
If we are comfortable with 3rd world type of healthcare delivery, then the training of medical doctors should be increased by 2 years, so that they will learn more about medications and dispensing, so that they will be able to do dispensing in the proper manner. At present this is NOT an outcome in the curriculum of the medical doctor; they are not trained in this practice (dispensing) at all. Under such a circumstance, the Ministry of Education should rationalise and close off the pharmacy courses and channel all prospective students to medical schools. This will be maximising the resources of parents and the country, as only those who are trained for a certain career should be doing the job of which they are trained.
With the current arguments going on, doctors are whipping up the concerns of patients by playing on the extra time needed for patients to get prescriptions filled in pharmacies which might be a distance away from the clinic. The current scenario exist as a consequence of no Dispensing Separation, a policy that had been maintained by the government for the past 6 decades. There is no incentive for pharmacists to open a pharmacy next to a doctor’s clinic as no or few prescriptions are coming to them to fill. The work which the pharmacists are trained in, is still being carried out by the medical doctors who NOT trained in this area.
In not having their prescriptions filled by the pharmacists, the patient is also being deprived of all the training of the pharmacists, their counselling on medications, interactions with other drugs, possible /foods/herbs/supplements, possible allergic effects.in other words they might not be given the best medications for their conditions and the treatment outcome are not be optimised.
One other very important benefit that the separation will bring about which has not been given too much prominence is that patients will be prescribed the best option for his medical condition. In the current system, the patient gets prescribed what is in the Doctor's small dispensary including those which are about to expire since the current system is all about business first. What is kept in the Doctor's small dispensary is also influenced greatly by the marketing strategies of the Drug Companies. With Dispensing Separation, this unhealthy aspect of Healthcare Industry in this country can be controlled.
Pharmacist good in giving meds..but can u ensure pts risk,compliance and complications??how do u monitor patient condition or follow-up for a certain chronic disease just an example like diabetes..can u do that??
If u think u can do that..would u take any responsibility if any mortality arise??can u??of course not!! coz u will never have DR in front of ur name..where ur first oath is totally different from us!!! (Do no harm!!)
Plus..if u think pts will come back n forth to the clinic and pharmacy just for the sake of their diabetes follow up and treatment..i don't think they will do that!!it is so ridiculous and definitely such a wasting of time..cost and transport problem furthermore..
Why so eager to do DS..while we already been duin that at private hosp and all gomens hosp and KK..but we call that as dispensary integration..if u r really concern about the patient care..come fight to work for us in private GP..we can hire u..instead of work away from us..
this will definitely make the health systems in GP much more better plus we can reduce the risk of giving wrong meds to the patient if we have pharmacist to work for us(if that is really ur main concern la kann)-yes fight for that..
So..the current system is already good and no patient has any complaint about it..then y bother to change??if u can get at least 20% from the rakyat marhaen to sign ur petition then please proceed. .
if none of them did.. then cont dreaming my frens!!!
Huh? So..the current system is already good? Good for the private prescribing and Dispensing Doctor you mean?

I get alot of emails of folks asking me where would be a good place to catfish from the banks. when you get around the big river towns or cities, bank fishing spots can get crowded along with alot of fishing pressure. This is one of many videos i will be doing over the course of my outings that i will share with everyone who is bank bound. This spot is very secluded with little or no pressure from anglers which also has a great potential for catching not only numbers of catfish, but there is a good chance you could hook into a trophy catfish too. However please remember that these trophy size catfish are a resource we cant afford to abuse, please practice catch and release with them. As far as the 5-10 lb eater catfish, there are plenty of them and certainly better eating than the larger fish. Good luck to all.

Fundamentally talking, you’ve got to have a look at a few items ahead of you decide to purchase a specific weed eater. Initial of all, you must contemplate the motor style. You will discover a few kinds according to their motor. You have a gasoline run a person, that’s essentially regarded certainly one of quite possibly the most powerful resources, despite the fact that it might get a small too noisy for your neighbors. Up coming, you may have the electrical string trimmer, which happens to be perfect for more compact gardens as you will require a power offer close to the machine. And final but not minimum, there is certainly the cordless one that will come with rechargeable batteries. This is often also great for more compact gardens simply because it does not past for a longer time than an hour or so.
I hope some of these suggestions offers you a soar around the complete practical experience of transferring. There exists a good deal a lot more points to take into account than simply buying up your things from level A to point B.
GT-200R: This contains a curved shaft trimmer and is light-weight. It is actually characterised by i-30 get started know-how. This is a gasoline battery weed eater and it is good in edging and trimming. It works very well despite having challenging weeds and tall grass.
And, no matter how significantly operate you set into them, sod and seed yards really don’t previous forever. Emerging guidance for recognising criteria of stihl weed eaters. All you will need is often a undesirable drought or a freak snowfall, and you may wind up with lifeless patches in your property. Then, it is again into the nursery or home enhancement retail store to purchase a lot more sod and seed!
They did. Black and Decker has several styles, even crafted to be solar billed. Within the initially of June in 2008 I selected the Black & Decker CMM1200 19-Inch 24-Volt Cordless Electric Mulching Lawn mower for $399.99 with free shipping and handling. Now its $359 and shipping continues for being free. That is actually a good bargain. I was thinking with gas prices once it may nicely take about Eighteen months to pay for my investment in money saved by not buying fuel.
With battery-powered weed eaters, the only glaring disadvantage is that you may need to prepare just one or two extra sets of batteries as backup. Otherwise, if the current batteries about the equipment suddenly run out in the middle of your function, it will be a hassle. Other than this, battery-powered weed eaters are better alternatives to get the job done areas not anywhere in the vicinity of a socket or electrical power outlet. The battery run weed eaters are also handy in times of electrical power interruptions. Also, without the hassle of cords, these machines can be dragged practically anywhere, even reaching the sides on the perform area farthest to the house.
A hand fork or small trowel are terrific when digging out isolated weeds from your lawn. If you try to pull them out by the leaves the roots are left behind and soon the weed is again. If you haven’t got a fork or trowel, an old blunt dinner knife is good, or even a screw driver. Just be careful not to injure yourself although.
You will find other cordless lawn mowers available on the market; most cost alot more versus Black and Decker products. Some have removable batteries; others you should not. It really is nice to generally be able to ignore the fuel pumps now, and smile. Not far too a lot, even though. You will find plenty of drivers in existence still paying a mint to fill the tanks for their cars and lawn mowers.Sierra Oncology, Inc. (NASDAQ:SRRA) Gets Upgrade From Wedbush Analyst

A big crowd was present for Laurimars first ever game and their early quarter presence was felt kicking the opening goal of the game and applying and abundance of pressure on the Eltham side. After the Turtles settled and started to work into their new game plan they have been working on over the pre-season the signs of a side that have played together for some years started to show. The Turtles pressure started to take control and with fierce tackling and superb ball movement through the midfield the Turtles piled on the next 5 goals to take a commanding lead at the first break.
Albeit a 6 quarter game and with no scoring, the Turtles new game style looked to be well rehearsed and their quick ball movement and early season skill seemed to raise eyebrows and impressing the early onlookers.
The Turtles official season commences in less than a month when they take on Prahran Assumption on April 8 and Eltham College Oval.In the kitchen today, Owner Joe Paglia joins us from Arturo Joe’s making Sunset Farm Osso Buco, a beef shank coated with flour and pan sauted in oil.

Caitlyn (Jessy Schram), an aspiring fashion designer and assistant to Abigail (Cheryl Ladd), a high-powered fashion magazine editor, finds her world turned upside down as the magazine not only runs a New Year's Eve fashion show but also a New Year's Eve ball afterwards which she must help organize. But on top of that it is rumoured that Prince Jeffery (Sam Page) will propose to Lady Isabelle Collins (Hayley Sales) at the ball and after seeing one of Caitlyn's designs Isabelle asks her to design a dress for her, something which puts Abigail's nose out of joint leading to her trying. It is one of the first things you notice in the Hallmark movie "Royal New Year's Eve" as we meet Prince Jeffery, Lady Isabelle and of course the Prince's assistant with each of them sounding completely unnatural. I know it is done partly for comedy effect but it ends up making this sort of romantic comedy a little too cheesy and distracting from the pleasant side of the movie.
Yes "Royal New Year's Eve" does have a pleasant side which sees Jessy Schram delivering plenty of niceness as Caitlyn who having to spend. But it is a sweet romantic drama which delivers the sort of fun you expect from a Hallmark movie with an extra layer of skulduggery thanks to the scheming Abigail.
What this all boils down to is that "Royal New Year's Eve" is just some pleasant romantic comedy fun which has a slightly different take on the whole "commoner" falls for a royal storyline which you tend to find in made for TV movies.Study on Yin Chang's Southward Journey to Lead the Army and Yuan Shikai Taking the Role
Wang Qingshuai;
According to related historical material, in the Minister of Army Yi Chang's southward journey to lead the army in 1911, he arrived in Xinyang on 17 October, but did not arrive in Xiaogan until five days later on 22 October. Then it took another five days before he ordered the Qing dynasty army to attack at dawn on 27 October. This military activity underwent a meandering course: at first he marched actively, but then he held back and at last stayed defensive. The reason of Yin Chang's unusual performance was neither Beiyang Army disobeyed his order nor he was incompetent or coward. After the Qing army's first failure on 18 October, Yin Chang realized it was not easy to cope with the revolutionary army; on one hand he requested the application of cannons and machine guns, but on the other he agreed with the "keeping on solid defense" strategy proposed by Yuan Shikai. As early as 21 October, the Qing government had decided, under the behind-the-scene propelling of Sheng Xuanhuai and Zai Ze, to call back Yin Chang and give Yuan Shikai full military authority in the condition that Yuan Shikai should promptly march southward. Sheng Xuanhuai and others had advocated "rapid extermination of the rebels" and had been discontent with Yin Chang holding back in Xinyang. Meanwhile, both the court and the public urged the government to summon back Yin Chang because the separation of leadership and authority was detrimental, which was also an important factor for Yin Chang's call-back.

There are barely any journal testimonials of the stream 63i which produced acquiring it one thing of a leap of religion, particularly as it is not low-cost (but you can store around). I have experimented with to make this overview as thorough and as sincere as feasible in scenario you are also asking yourself whether or not to purchase or not. I have lived with this minimal machine for a when and waited in advance of producing this evaluate to avoid obtaining carried away by 1st impressions. Getting now received utilized to this box of tips and owning tried it is different features i can honestly say that i love this roberts, for the sizing of it, the sound and features has amazed me no close. It is a sensible searching box probably a very little larger than a shoe box and whether it can be meant to be or not it is really portable. I needed a little something to sound great both in the conservatory or at the odd bbq, it’s possible even to wake up to in the bedroom and the roberts appeared to fit the monthly bill. I like my music and hi-fi’s and for me it has to sound very good – for the measurement of this machine the sound quality is exceptional, getting comprehensive and warm. You will have to established the equaliser yourself to find the sweet location – this is the only player i have exactly where the treble is established larger than the bass – but it works and creates a loaded sound and manages to uncover incredibly suitable element from all sources. It would not sound as very good as an costly hello-fi but it definitely will not disappoint and will fill a room (or patio) beautifully. If you want to you can connect it to your hi fi or encompass system – no, that will not defeat the item since the roberts has so quite a few sources to select from – read on. . . I found the controls and menus intuitive sufficient and had no trouble with the contact controls on the device – you can change the sensitivity in any case. The buttons on the distant are effortless to come across even in the darkish as you actually you should not have to use very a lot of of them to handle things. The usb and sd card inputs are a bonus and i consider aimed far more at staying capable to record radio to them as opposed to playing media as a result of them – it will enjoy of class but will not demonstrate the album/monitor facts, just folders. The cd player doesn’t either which is peculiar in this day and age but i won’t be able to say i minded far too a great deal. The sound copy from these digital sources was again fantastic. Recording to the gadgets was uncomplicated – but is there nearly anything to record? oh of course, a lot. I really don’t actually have an ipod, really don’t feel they essentially sound that good and i have a sony as a substitute, but as this is a created for ipod merchandise i have no doubt that it will do the job as properly with your ipod as with all other resources and with just as superior a sound. There is an auxilliary input for us non-ipod possessing people, and all over again this works just fantastic, just transform the quantity up on your participant. Dab reception from the created in aerial is really great and it picked up 50-odd stations. You can take away the equipped aerial and use a coaxial a single if you would like – but to be genuine i failed to acquire this for dab which i think has pretty limited decision. Link to my wireless network was very simple,(and perfectly discussed in the handbook which is thorough and distinct)you will want your community vital and if you are not confident where to obtain this just google the issue. It linked and accessed home windows media player (i have home windows seven)without having problems – and it does exhibit album/track details from this. I have not knowledgeable and drop outs or issues with this operate. Wi-fi reception is pretty very good and i have no issues connecting wherever in the dwelling or outside the house – there are a lot more reception bars than my laptop. If you have not tried out internet radio then you genuinely really should do. Some stations broadcast in a low bitrate but a lot of are bigger excellent than dab, some very substantially so – and you will obtain dab stations here anyway. The simple fact is that the roberts tends to make all of them sound quite, extremely superior and you will in no way be trapped for some thing to pay attention to yet again – there are some definitely excellent stations out there, advert no cost and very good tunes way too. For the reason that there are so lots of you sign up the roberts on the ‘frontier silicon’ site (the system data menu will give you an obtain code, yet again the guide tells you in which to find this) and listed here you can help you save all of your favorite stations beneath unique genre’s which then show on the radio itself. Uncover one, generate it down, insert it through the site and it will be on your radio, you can retailer hundreds of them. You can also look for on the roberts alone, by area, genre and many others. And you can retail store some by using presets, but i find no need to do so. You will obtain a station actively playing what you like, when you want it, and in lots of cases without any adverts. Record it to your flash memory/sd card and you can acquire it with you anywhere you want. You can also get ‘listen again’ plans from the bbc. Then there is last fm, you should not beneath-amount it. You are provided a month’s membership to this for absolutely free and if you like it you can subscribe for £3 per month (pay back by way of paypal every single thirty day period or as a a person-off for as several/many as you want). I like this support, it takes a minimal bit of discovering but if you get it appropriate you will conclusion up with a personalised advert no cost radio station that is familiar with what music you like and will perform it for you 24/7. It will throw in some tracks it feels you may perhaps like, if you do, tell it through the distant, if you you should not just press the ‘ban’ button and it is not going to appear again. Outstanding, presents hrs and hrs of enjoyment and if you want to transfer to the upcoming monitor just push ff as you would on a cd. You cannot record from last fm but i can hear to new music i like but have never bought and i have also been introduced to new artists i would never have identified existed. As a clock radio you have two alarms – 7 days and weekends- and can select what to wake up to. The exhibit is dimmable and is not as well brilliant at evening as some have proposed. In all i am actually delighted with this invest in and do not regret spending the income, i have a truly functional little bit of kit that will preserve me amused for several hours (times basically) on conclusion with a wide range of songs i can really decide on myself or have decided on for me. I guess there are some quirks – such as usb and cd not displaying details, but i am not at all upset by these and i carefully advocate this as a worthwhile get. Long term critique:i just have to update this to share my long expression views on this genuinely fantastic product or service. I have experienced it now for about two many years, it is still heading sturdy and has carried out faultlessly. I can actually say it is my favorite toy and i wouldn’t be with out it now. Possessing experienced a summer this year i can’t anxiety sufficient what a pleasure it has been to sit outside the house on an night becoming equipped to hear to this kind of a enormous variety of new music with these kinds of superb sound top quality. And that is why i am doing this later overview – the sound top quality. There is a assessment on listed here that talks of awful sound distortion, please, make sure you never let it put you off. The speakers on this roberts just need running in and i stick to my previously information – set the treble high and the bass low to start with (i know, i would hardly ever aspiration of carrying out it ordinarily) and the sound is good to get started with but wow, does it get improved around time. Set in the correct spot (a corner is very best for mirrored sound from the bass ports)the sound is incredible, excellent clarity from all resources and i now have the bass and treble set where by i would ordinarily set them with no distortion. The sound is definitely comprehensive and warm – it manages to have a little something of that aged ‘radio’ top quality that i can’t pretty describe but is unique to other hi fi i own and it receives by far the most use. It can stand on your own sound smart and i really like listening to it. I am hooked, totally. Internet radio is by far exceptional and never ever uninteresting, not often interrupted by possibly adverts or presentersand just seems excellent. I nevertheless subscribe to very last fm which is an fantastic music services and i use it most days, it is a these types of a shame about the latest tragedy joined to it. If this roberts broke tomorrow i would obtain a further yet another a person tomorrow and then be concerned about the revenue later. It ain’t affordable – but get a person, if you enjoy it fifty percent as a lot as i do you definitely will not regret it. This just one goes up to 11. Comprehensively, totally advised. .
Excellent Item But Not Very Five Star. I bought this unit as a substitute for my ageing and cumbersome hello-fi. I was searching for something with internet radio and an ipod dock. Soon after looking at a lot of other tends to make and products i made a decision on the roberts stream 63i. The issue that clinched it was the inclusion of a cd player. I determined that even although i have all my new music in mp3 structure i wasn’t however prepared to just take the action of entirely abandoning cds. Very first impressions had been excellent. The device was a minor lesser than i assumed but this was due to not examining the measurements prior to i purchased it. The internet radio was really effortless to established up and it can be a breeze to navigate the 1000’s of stations obtainable. The sound is also good for a unit of this kind of dimension. Dab reception is superior and it picked up extra stations than my former system. Owning the skill to engage in all the new music from my computer was an added bonus. Setting this up was incredibly uncomplicated with home windows seven. I just had to click 1 choice in home windows media participant. I may perhaps be showing my age but it looks magical to have accessibility to all the songs on my computer by just switching on the pc and not possessing to touch it. There were being a few slight issues which i did not expect when paying out over £300. The remote management isn’t going to normally operate when far more than about 2m away. This isn’t a huge issue due to the fact you are not able to see the display from that much in any case but is annoying when making an attempt to regulate the volume from length. When enjoying mp3s from a cd, sd card or usb you are unable to navigate by artist, album, observe only by folder and track selection. You can only see the track name when it is playing by urgent the info button. This helps make it really tricky to navigate and my original concept of finding a major sd card and placing all my new music on it is now not an selection. You can navigate by artist, album and so on when streaming from a computer system. A further insignificant position is despite the fact that it will work with the apple iphone it is really not created for it. You get a message when plugging in your telephone to explain to you that you might get some interference. On a new products at this cost i might expect something with an ipod dock to also function appropriately with iphones. Total this is a good products and very near to 5 stars. However owing to the large rate and minimal niggles i can only give it four. .
The STREAM 63i is a sound system for all of your listening requires, it offers DAB/FM and Wi-Fi radio, a dock for iPod and, a CD participant.

Stream 63i You should not Forget about About ‘last.fm’. Roberts stream63i-black wi-fi internet/dab/fm radio with cd participant & ipod dock in blacki have had the stream63i given that the starting of december when it was released. I was likely to acquire the mp53i until by luck i discovered that the stream63i would be unveiled early december. I am happy i waited as this is a really fantastic new music player. Its uncomplicated to established up, seems to be and feels fantastic and addresses nearly anyway you could desire to play tunes other than a 6′ solitary and cassette tape. Sound high-quality is fantastic, not brain blowing but the optical url can connect to my encompass system if expected but i have not bothered nevertheless. I would only do that to get a much larger bass sound for say a celebration, or else no want. I did not find the built-in sound configurations were up to substantially so just set up my own, on the other hand that is down to private taste. I experienced purchsed it for use in a smaller home but have saved it in the lounge so significantly. One particular function that really should not be ignored is very last. Fm compatibility. I started off a final. Fm account very last yr simply because as a loved ones we hear to new music on i-pods, computer systems and laptops, last. Fm presents you accessibility to a checklist of saved favourite tracks more than the internet. It is like your personal individual radio station. It also presents you obtain to new songs to match your tastes or equivalent to your favorite artists. If you like a monitor you can help you save as a favorite, if not it will not participate in it once again. The total account price £3 for each month on the other hand soon after a month or two we stopped employing it. With the addition of the stream63i, with developed in very last. Fm compatibility we are a lot more than obtaining our monies really worth. Probably fifty% of the tunes we hear to is past. Fm sourced. I just imagine this could be a aspect that could be neglected by some users. Effectively value providing a check out, there is a free of charge demo provide to get you started. The only challenge i have had so considerably is the distant can be temperamental as situations. In general 4. five/5 but as you can only give complete quantities it will have to be a 4/five. Very well carried out to roberts, its an additional reward to guidance a uk firm. .
Now Dab + Completely ready – I Hope. Just to update the details. Roberts have confirmed to me (by electronic mail) final 7 days (spring 2013) that the 63i is dab+ all set and displays cd text and file tags. On this foundation i discover it tough to fault the features of the 63i and it looks to be a deserving substitute for my denon s52 dab that i liked but which wasn’t dependable and failed to last extended. Can not wait around to give the roberts a whirl. For the duration of my window searching i was advised (by a highly regarded supplier) that specified the 30 pin to lightning connector improvements roberts program to get rid of ipod docks upcoming year and depend exclusively on wi-fi connectivity. This obtained me wondering that as i depend on my ipod typical now is the time to get. .
Roberts 63i Intrnet Radio. I necessary a radio for the bed room that would play new music saved as flac information on my wd mybookworld server. Fm reception is bad and i essential either dab or internet radio. The roberts 63i dealt with equally these requirements extremely perfectly and making use of the set up wizard was up and operating in less than five minutes. The sound is superior and distinct and i like the piano gloss complete. The only criticism i have problems last fm which is involved free of charge for 1 thirty day period and then chargable which i uncover challenging to obtain and a squander of time. I shall surely not be making use of it.

Conclusion of Roberts Radios Roberts STREAM63i CD/DAB/FM Internet Sound System
I like my tunes and hi-fi’s and for me it has to sound very good – for the dimension of this equipment the sound good quality is superb, remaining complete and warm. You will have to set the equaliser by yourself to come across the sweet place – this is the only player i have where by the treble is set bigger than the bass – but it performs and makes a abundant sound and manages to find really appropriate element from all resources. The usb and sd card inputs are a reward and i imagine aimed a lot more at getting equipped to record radio to them as opposed to actively playing media by way of them – it will play of program but will not exhibit the album/observe information and facts, just folders. I really don’t really possess an ipod, never consider they truly sound that very good and i have a sony as a substitute, but as this is a built for ipod products i have no question that it will do the job as nicely with your ipod as with all other sources and with just as fantastic a sound. Some stations broadcast in a small bitrate but numerous are bigger top quality than dab, some pretty considerably so – and you will obtain dab stations below in any case.
The reality is that the roberts helps make all of them sound very, really very good and you will never be caught for a little something to pay attention to all over again – there are some truly fantastic stations out there, advert no cost and very good new music too. Since there are so numerous you sign-up the roberts on the ‘frontier silicon’ site (the system info menu will give you an access code, yet again the handbook tells you where by to discover this) and listed here you can save all of your favourite stations beneath distinct genre’s which then clearly show on the radio alone. I like this support, it takes a very little bit of finding out but if you get it appropriate you will conclusion up with a personalised advert absolutely free radio station that understands what tunes you like and will perform it for you 24/seven. Owning experienced a summer season this year i are unable to anxiety ample what a pleasure it has been to sit outside on an night getting capable to hear to these kinds of a substantial range of songs with this sort of superb sound top quality. The speakers on this roberts just will need working in and i adhere to my before suggestions – set the treble superior and the bass minimal to begin with (i know, i would never desire of carrying out it normally) and the sound is superior to commence with but wow, does it get better over time.
Established in the appropriate place (a corner is greatest for reflected sound from the bass ports)the sound is amazing, excellent clarity from all sources and i now have the bass and treble set exactly where i would normally set them with no distortion. The sound is genuinely full and heat – it manages to have one thing of that old ‘radio’ excellent that i won’t be able to really explain but is diverse to other hi fi i have and it gets by far the most use. Internet radio is by significantly exceptional and by no means tedious, rarely interrupted by possibly adverts or presenters and just seems terrific. I was hunting for anything with internet radio and an ipod dock. The internet radio was quite easy to established up and it really is a breeze to navigate the thousands of stations accessible.
Roberts stream63i-black wi-fi internet/dab/fm radio with cd participant & ipod dock in blacki have experienced the stream63i since the starting of december when it was released. I did not find the built-in sound options ended up up to a great deal so just setup my have, however that is down to individual flavor. My top precedence was the sound high-quality of the product and this radio has truly happy me in that respect. It has a much cleaner sound than the coulorstream had and for its sizing produces a fantastic sound – not specifically audiophile good quality but then neither is dab. The addition of the cd player is a actual furthermore and i have not tried using it yet but it also has the ability to record direct from radio or cd to sd card or usb memory stick.
i wanted a radio for the bed room that would enjoy audio stored as flac files on my wd mybookworld server. Fm reception is lousy and i necessary both dab or internet radio. We acquired this to change our dab radio in the kitchen area that experienced gone kaput. Acquiring internet radio on your ipod it appeared a great plan to have the exact same in the home. So easy to established up and the sound good quality is outstanding.
The producing high quality is exceptional as is the sound reproduction, on the other hand, i have an ongoing concern with the internet radio ‘freezing’ on every single occation it is applied in this manner, this can transpire at any time from a couple minutes to many hrs. I are living in an space with weak reception but the (considerably more affordable) radio this replaced experienced no trouble receiving the national bbc stations. – when streaming music wirelessly from my music server (upnp) the i would typically experience rebuffering – the signal would fall and the equipment would speedily drain its inside buffer (this only appears to be to keep ~ten seconds of tunes, pretty miserly observing as memory is affordable these days), then it would reconnect and get started actively playing once more choosing up from exactly where it still left off. – if i perform a cd by way of to the complete, and go away the device switched on, the cd will start out to participate in again from the starting soon after 50 % an hour or so. The wi-fi radio is excellent, we have horrible reception in this article so owning the radio work via the wi-fi link is outstanding.
Will work with virgin media now which was important for me and provides terrific sound excellent excellent appears and a load of functions. Roberts stream tremendous music device, this sound system is absolutely fantastic, i never understood that there were being somany radio stations, with dab and internet radio there is just about every style of tunes that has been invented. Delighted from working day one – setup is easy peasy — sounds outstanding to me (i am not an audio whizz – so are unable to decide any even more other than to repeat that on a working day to working day foundation the sound is fantastic ) – heaps of radio stations to hear to – all value having to pay that bit further – can undoubtedly suggest. It plays cd’s, streams from an countless listing of radio stations from all over the earth, tunes in to your local fm and dab radio broadcasts, lets you hear to mpegs, previous fm. For a relatively compact machine the quality of sound is extremely good at far more than satisfactory degrees and you can also hear with headphones or feed it into an exterior amplifier and speakers.
I use it as bedside alarm, clock and radio but it is compact ample to have into another area and furnished you have radio signal company and/or wifi/community obtain it could present a top quality portable radio facility. I shall exchange a different radio with a roberts wifi as quickly as i have saved up. The internet radio choice operates functions well with my bt wireless router, sd card recording is great, but fast ahead is a tiny sluggish. For me the dab radio has a lot far better reception than fm, but that is possibly because of to domestically poor fm coverage. The roberts did locate several additional stations than my other dab radio.
We did want a thing for the kitchen area that gave us big wide variety and the ipod dock so this matches the invoice beautifully and the sound high-quality is pretty great more than enough. Dab reception is normally u/s in our location but the internet radio reception is excellent with very good sound also. Pretty effectively designed and a terrific established of functions – seems excellent – internet radio is the upcoming of radio for selection from all-around the globe. Incredibly uncomplicated to open up files and team globe large radio stations or genres of songs. I did come across it extremely ‘boomy’ even though (some individuals might find it okay, but i am not a lover of far too substantially bass), so retained the speakers from the outdated hello-fi, acquired a mini amp and now engage in the audio via the outdated speakers.
My specifications:-various abilities including: radio (analogue, dab and internet) cd personal computer streaming external input line out-not iphone specific (it does have apple iphone dock but can use external enter. )-stand alone unit (not individual speakers)-affordable value for full unit (ie not £500 to 1k+)-affordable sizepros-multiple sources such as regular radio, dab radio, internet radio, streaming from personal computer, past. -fantastic sound: i am no connoisseur of sound but i dohave an ear for hiss or other failings. But ahead of i explain these, i should really condition that the sound high-quality is incredibly fantastic, albeit a bit punchy on the bass side of issues which doesn’t do it any favours when performed at low quantity (the human voice tending to sound percussive and thumpy). The preset for storing radio stations is definitely easy to set up.
Very first disappointment was that it refused to perform a pair of my older and considerably treasured cds – types that played and however do participate in flawlessly quickly on other equipment. I was following a dab radio to get bbc radio 5 devoid of distortion. The internet radio is quite very good in fact, the dab pretty superior, the fm is suitable and the functionality with a cd or an ipod is of a really substantial order – as with most roberts merchandise the tone selection is fantastic and not much taken off from radios at 2 times this price tag. Internet radio is also a very good reward as the reception to fm radio exactly where we are living is atrocious. Fantastic choice of approaches to enjoy new music through sd card and usbi having said that do not feel the sound is as good as my outdated creatve soundworks cd / radio but are unable to purchase this any longer in the united kingdom.
I purchased it for its internet radio functionality as the radio reception the place i live in the yorkshire dales is abysmal. The shock was that the dab reception was very good – a hundred% much better than my previous sony dab radio even devoid of an external aerial. On all other fronts the sound top quality is amazing and it performs & expenses my wifes ipod touch four extremely perfectly. I like streaming on my roberts stream because i can obtain all the stations i like listningf to like oldies elvis stationalso a large amount of rock and roll stations all extremely simple to find and list to your favorites. Have been using this a pair of months now, and seriously can’t fault it. The sound is wonderful and the variable enter sources, cd, ipod, dab and internet radio, all get the job done a take care of.
The sound is wonderfully crystal clear, fm reception from an inside aerial superb and all in all i’m delighted with the radio. It was quick to set up , sound excellent is good for these types of a little system, and internet radio is wonderful. This roberts stream 63i is a excellent songs system, sound top quality is wonderful and the internet radio is great. Roberts radio personnel ended up amazing and so useful as the scree was defective on my item when it arrived. Roberts radios sorted it out.
Good quality item1. Perfectly recomended, pretty superior sound, very well produced, neat and effortless to area in any house. I hear to internet radio all the time now. The 63i was obtained to play cd’s, stream tunes from my computer system and play music from an ipad. When comparing fm to electronic there isn’t really actually a comparison the electronic sound is just so considerably improved if you like scanning the airwaves then consider looking the internet radio stations, it does this very effectively and there are some strange and excellent stations (i observed one that just plays pink floyd music all working day lengthy – which i like and my spouse hates) if the 63i is too expensive then have a look at the 83i you wont be unhappy. Bought this since i wanted an integrated radio that did everything – i’m in eire and there are pretty couple electronic radio stations here so i experienced to be guaranteed i could get internet radio.
Easy to set up, extremely intuitive and great sound system on it. Only detail i obtain a nuisance is that my notebook has to be turned on for it to link with the radio but i never believe that is robert’s fault. Exceptionally delighted with this products, like the sound and the seems of this sound system. I can get my favorite radio stations, uncover new ones, pay attention to my audio books or just charge the ipod. I preferred an internet /dab / fm radio with ipod for my ten thousand+ tunes.
If you are not able to discover factors you like on the internet, dab, fm and ipod then possibly last is for you but not for me. It was acquired because she likes to hook up her ipod to it far too and it has internet radio. I use this radio in mix with a stereo amplifier set and is connected in our dwelling with the internet by fritz. I now required an internet radio / cd for my lounge, as my companion experienced made me clear away my bose encompass sound with its 6 speakers, when we re-adorned.
Excellent Piece of Kit with a Few Minor Niggles. Looks great and, more importantly, sounds superb. I don’t have an ipod or last. Fm account, so haven’t tried these but all the other advertised functions work very well, with just a few minor issues (which i’d like to think a firmware upgrade would fix, if roberts are reading this. . )- dab reception is okay rather than brilliant. I live in an area with poor reception but the (much cheaper) radio this replaced had no trouble receiving the national bbc stations. With this one i have to place it (and align the aerial) very carefully to ensure 3+ bars of reception (less than this and it cuts out intermittently) – moving it just a few cm around seems to make a difference. – when streaming music wirelessly from my music server (upnp) the i would often suffer rebuffering – the signal would drop and the machine would rapidly drain its internal buffer (this only seems to hold ~10 seconds of music, quite miserly seeing as memory is cheap these days), then it would reconnect and start playing again picking up from where it left off. Since i started using the ethernet connection instead (purchasing a pair of powerline adapters) this problem has gone away. – if i play a cd through to the finish, and leave the unit switched on, the cd will start to play again from the beginning after half an hour or so. Also in some circumstances (i think if you switch the unit off in the middle of playing a cd and swap discs) the player will sometimes start playing newly inserted discs at something other than track 1. I don’t regret buying this, even at the high price, because the overall quality is worth it, especially the sound. But given roberts’ premium reputation i’m disappointed that at least some of these issues (cd replay, small upnp buffer) are there. .Last 24hrs of Weather Trends for Chelmsford Essex from CM2Weather

2018-01-30PMSA Gauteng Event, 'Building your Career in Projects'A few days back I was sharing with you 10 Amazing Things About Poland that you might not know. Seems to me I should also do my homeland justice and present you some rather interesting things about my hometown, about Iasi. So without any further ado let me get into that:
1) Iasi is the 4th biggest city in Romania, when it comes to the number of people living in it, just after the capital: Bucharest Cluj Napoca and Timisoara. The city grows even bigger if you take into account the number of students that come to the Uni's here. The faculty of Medicine is extremely popular and the "Alexandru Ioan Cuza" University in Copou is also very attractive to young people worldwide.
2) The first printed books in Moldavia (the region) was done in Iasi in the year 1643. You can still visit the house where it was printed - it is a small museum close to the Palace of Culture.
3) Iasi was set on fire 3 times - first in 1513 by the tatars, 1538 by the ottomans and then in 1686 by Russians.
4) Iasi was the capital of Moldavia for almost 300 years (1565-1859). It was moved from Suceava by Alexandru Lăpuşneanu.
5) Vasile Lupu created the very first school in Romanian language - you can see it on Stefan cel Mare Street, at the end towards the Palace of Culture. He also established a printer / press in the church Trei Ierarhi - also located on Stefan cel Mare Street.
6) Iasi was mentioned the first time in a commercial privilege emitted in 1408 by the ruler of Moldavia, Alexandru cel Bun. That makes the city over 600 years old ;)
7) In 1930 the number of Jewish people in Iasi was actually half of the number of Romanian! There were: 63.168 Romanian, 34.662 Jews, 980 German, 918 Russians and the rest up to 102.872 were other nations, in low numbers.
8) Iasi has three oldest and biggest Botanical Garden in Europe!
9) It is very similar to Rome in the sense of being named the "legendary city of the seven hills" - namely Cetatuia, Galata, Copou, Bucium, Sorogari, Repedea and Breazu.
10) The Grand Hotel Traian in the Union Square is "The" posh hotel in town. It was recently refurbished and it is in itself a gem. The building is from the 19th century and it is an architectural masterpiece of the French architect Gustave Eiffel - inaugurated in 1882.
Yours very much sincerly,

The Monmouth County Freeholder Board is declaring September "Go Gold Month" to raise awareness of pediatric cancer.
Every year almost 13,000 people under the age of 21 are diagnosed with cancer and seven children a day die from the disease.
"In September we pay tribute to the families, friends, professionals, and communities who lend their strength to children fighting pediatric cancer," says Freeholder Deputy Director Serena DiMaso. "We remember the young lives taken and dedicate our energies to combating pediatric cancer."
The Freeholder Board recently presented a proclamation for "Go Gold Month" to Terry Kelly, who lost her daughter to leukemia, and Robert Heugle of the Frances Foundation for Kids Fighting Cancer, a local non-profit charitable organization committed to bringing smiles to kids fighting cancer.
Gold has been the ribbon color for universal awareness of pediatric cancer since 1997. In the last 25 years, only two drugs have been specifically developed for children's cancer. DiMaso says it's shocking and saddening that only 3% of funds raised on behalf of the National Cancer Institute go directly to pediatric cancer research.
The Freeholder Board is urging everyone to get involved by wearing gold during the month of September, donating to a local or national charity, and urging lawmakers to continue funding pediatric cancer research.Basic Linux Terminlogy
By "Directory" under Linux we mean what is called under Windows "Folder".
However sometimes in Linux Distributions the word "Folder" is used as well.
The home directory (called in the File manager "Home") is in Linux denoted by "~".
Subdirectories are separated in Linux by backslash "/".
For instance "~/bin" is the subdirectory bin of ~ where ~ denotes Home
So its from the file manager reached by using Home -> bin

Bridcutt injured his Achilles in the 1-0 loss at Reading on April 1 and will not be risked by Whites head coach Garry Monk for Sunday’s clash at the DW Stadium.
No 2 goalkeeper Silvestri is also still recovering from an operation on his knee to correct ligament damage, while Jansson starts a three-game ban for picking up 15 yellow cards.
The Swedish centre back is set to be replaced by Liam Cooper who Monk now has available, with the defender having served his six-game ban for stamping on Reading’s Reece Oxford.
“Liam will be out for the game,” confirmed Monk, speaking at his Thursday afternoon press conference at Thorp Arch.
“He could possibly play at a push but there’s no point in pushing him at this point and it’s about really letting that Achilles settle down.
SUSPENDED: Leeds United's Pontus Jansson. Picture: Jonathan Gawthorpe
“Pontus is suspended and obviously there’s Marco but the rest are fully fit.”
Asked if Silvestri would be fine to return for pre-season, Monk reasoned: “I think at a push maybe he could have made the next couple of weeks but now, in this situation, it’s not worth the risk and it’s about making sure that everything heels properly.
“It’s just about making sure and there’s no need to push them this week.”
There’s no point in pushing him at this point and it’s about really letting that Achilles settle down.Leeds boss Garry Monk on Liam Bridcutt’s injuryLearning Resource Center
Mission
The Learning Resource Center (LRC) provides services to the TASIS community designed to support and enhance the educational experience of students, parents, and faculty in our learning community. The LRC offers a variety of programs and services, some of which can be accessed by all members of the community and others that are available only via qualification or psychometric evaluation.
Services and Fees
Basic Services
Fees for enrollment in the LRC for the 2017–2018 academic year are as follows:
- Elementary School: CHF 750
- Middle School: CHF 1,000
- High School: CHF 1,500
These fees help support the costs of delivering Basic Services, which include the following:
- formulation of a Learning Support Plan (LSP) describing your child’s cognitive strengths and weaknesses and detailing the accommodations he or she is entitled to on the basis of his or her learning difference*
- yearly LSP meeting with parents, teachers, and the student
- “push-in” services and formal bi-yearly feedback to parents
- consultations with LRC staff on an as-needed basis
- provision of extended time on internal tests and exams
- applications to external testing agencies for accommodations on external exams (e.g., PSAT, SAT, ACT, AP, and IB)
* The type of classroom accommodations varies by diagnosis and age of the student. In all cases, however, the goal of providing accommodations is to remove obstacles to performance so that the student has equal opportunity to learn and to demonstrate his or her competence.
Additional Services for Students
For students requiring remediation, the LRC will organize and deliver specialized “pull-out” instruction in specific academic areas (e.g., reading, writing, math) during the course of the school day. These services are only available to students in the Elementary or Middle School, as High School students requiring remediation are referred to the TASIS Tutoring Program and pay for services accordingly. Pull-out remediation for groups with 3–4 students are subject to the following price structure:
- CHF 3,375 for three 45-minute sessions per week
- CHF 4,500 for four 45-minute sessions per week
- CHF 5,625 for five 45-minute sessions per week
Pull-out sessions that involve 1–2 students per group are subject to the following price structure:
- CHF 4.320 for three 45-minute sessions per week
- CHF 5,760 for four 45-minute sessions per week
- CHF 7,200 for five 45-minute sessions per week
Please note that despite the best efforts of children, parents, and teachers, interventions and accommodations sometimes are not sufficient for a student to succeed academically. In those instances, an appropriate conclusion is a misfit between the child and the School program and the response to such situations is to find a school more suited to the child’s educational needs.
Organizational/Study Skills Tutorial
Beginning in September 2016, the LRC began offering an Organizational/Study Skills (OSS) Tutorial. In addition to students diagnosed with ADHD, many students with specific learning differences (dyslexia, dysgraphia, and dyscalculia) also experience difficulties with executive function skills. Executive functions include a variety of skills important for academic success, including regulating attention and emotions, selecting and initiating relevant task goals, planning and organization, shifting problem solving strategies, self-monitoring, sustaining concentration, and working memory. LRC staff will be providing a semester-by-semester OSS Tutorial for students in the MS and HS who are enrolled in the LRC. The sessions will be held twice weekly, and lessons will be interwoven with students’ actual homework assignments, projects, and tests. General themes will include planning and organization, time management, prioritizing and organizing homework assignments, note-taking skills, memorization strategies, test preparation, and emotion regulation. Similar to the “pull-out” remediation, the OSS Tutorial will be delivered by a learning specialist in a 4:1 student to teacher format. In the MS, it may be possible to offer the OSS Tutorial during the study hall period, but the diversity of the HS schedule would necessitate an after-school program. Fees for the OSS Tutorial will be CHF 1,200 for each semester. Parents may choose to enroll their child in the fall semester, spring semester, or both.
Services to the Community
Operating as a community resource, the LRC works to provide a variety of programs and initiatives to improve the educational experience and learning opportunities for all. Some of these services are available free of charge whereas others involve fees for service. Examples of community services include the following:
- workshops in learning strategies, stress management interventions, and parent education groups
- consultations with faculty and parents regarding pathways to student success
- professional development training for faculty and staff
Admission Requirements
Students with diagnosed learning differences are admitted to TASIS based on the following criteria:
- average or above average intellectual ability (as measured by standardized IQ tests)
- excellent motivation, a positive attitude, and a good work ethic
- committed to participating fully in the life of the School
- seeks and would benefit from a college preparatory program
- committed to learning or perfecting English language skills (whether native or non-native speakers)
- committed to being a good citizen, in sympathy with the program
As TASIS does not have a full range of learning support services, admission of a student with learning differences is contingent upon a match between the level of service available and the needs of the student and family based on multiple sources of information. A student’s acceptance and continued placement at TASIS is dependent upon full disclosure during the admissions process. Failure to fully disclose information regarding a student’s learning differences may jeopardize his or her current and future placement at TASIS.
The policy of the Learning Resource Center requires that a student has received a comprehensive psychoeducational evaluation within the past three years from an appropriate psychometric evaluator (e.g., clinical, neuropsychological, and/or educational psychologist). If the testing and report are not in English, the family will need to have it translated prior to submitting the report to TASIS. The evaluation must include the following:
- standardized IQ test with reported standard scores and percentile ranks (e.g., WISC, WAIS, Stanford-Binet)
- standardized achievement test with reported standard scores and percentile ranks (e.g., WIAT, Woodcock Johnson)
- other standardized tests related to the referral question (e.g., reading, short-term memory, attention, emotional functioning)
- diagnosis by a recognized diagnostic system (e.g., DSM-V or ICD-10)
- comparison of a student’s performance on timed and untimed tests if the student is seeking extended time as an accommodation
- list of recommended accommodations based on the results of the evaluationNear

As a communications pro, you want to stay ahead of any crisis or even potential crisis.
Clothing giant H&M has apologized and removed an advertising image of a black model in a sweatshirt with the words "Coolest monkey in the jungle".
AfricaNews.com:-Swedish fashion brand, H&M have attracted a strong social media backlash after what most people considered a racist photo appeared on their website.
The brand removed the image and apologized, but kept in place other designs modeled by white children.
H&M, based in Sweden, issued an apology via the New York Daily News on Monday from its Stockholm headquarters.
"We understand that many people are upset about the image", representatives told PR News in an email.
After facing sharp criticism on social media, the brand apologized on Monday and seemed to remove the item from its U.S. website. And the Weeknd has tweeted that he's "deeply offended" and that he's cutting ties with the store.
Toronto-based rapper, The Weeknd, who released his own line with H&M past year, announced via Twitter that he will no longer be working with the company. "We believe in diversity and inclusion in all that we do, and will be reviewing our internal routines". "The image has been removed from all online channels and the product will not be for sale in the United States".The Great Egg Debate- Eggs are a great source of protein (with 10 g per egg) and can help you feel satisfied longer than cereal or simple carbohydrates.

The yolk contains the fat (to help you feel full) as well as B-vitamins and iron. Eating 1-2 eggs a few times a week should not affect your cholesterol. The saturated fat in that extra portions of meat will raise your cholesterol faster than any measly egg. Combining an egg with a complex carb (a whole grain english muffin, wheat toast, or oatmeal makes for a great breakfast.

Resident of Upper Beeding and later Steyning.
Some scarce, sepia-tinted real photographic cards of Beeding and the Downs at Poynings with white borders are marked "Oldacre" on the front. This is an unusual surname in Sussex, and, although no initials are given, it is reasonable to assume that the publisher was Everard Oldacre, who is listed as a private resident at Oak Cottage in Upper Beeding in Kelly's 1915 Sussex Directory. There is no mention of him in the 1911 and 1918 editions. The 1919 Electoral Register lists him as a voter (with his wife Mary) at a house called Bonnington at Steyning and at another house, Bramburye, close to the railway station at Bramber, but this time without Mary. The couple may have been in the process of moving house or perhaps Everard had acquired Bramburye as an investment. The Autumn 1920 Register lists them both at Glebe Cottage in Beeding. Within a few years they moved to a house called The Homestead in Upper Beeding.
Oldacre cards have uneven handwritten captions and a serial number. The highest seen is 15, which suggests that only a few cards were produced. Subjects include "From Beeding Hill", "Haytime" and "Harvesting at Beeding". A 1928 postmark is the earliest reported, and all the cards employ a style of preprinted back that became popular with Sussex publishers in 1927.
A card of The Homestead viewed from the kitchen garden may have been produced for personal and family use. It is labelled R8 in contrast to other Oldacre cards, whose serial numbers lack a letter prefix.It too has a 1927 style back.
Oldacre was born on December 28, 1871 at Oakley in Croxall in the Tamworth area of Staffordshire. His father, Walter Oldacres, held a 230 acre farm (Broadfields) and employed 15 men and a boy. Walter had been born at Normanton Turville in Leicestershire in about 1833. Everard's mother was Helen Oldacres, née Norman, who had been born in about 1838 at Cosford in Warwickshire if the 1881 and 1891 censuses are to be believed, though the 1871 census says Leicestershire while the 1901 census plumps for Rugby in Warwickshire!
Walter and Helen Oldacres had had five children before Everard was born, and employed a governess to look after them all. The oldest child was Gertrude Mary Oldacres, born in 1859. She was followed in 1861 by Arthur James Oldacres, then Albert Norman Oldacres in 1862, Maud Oldacres in about 1864 and Walter Lionel Oldacres in 1865. Walter Oldacres failed to register Everard's birth until the end of May 1872, which nowadays would have earned him a stiff reprimand and a fine.
For some unknown reason Walter Oldacres decided during the 1870s to shorten his surname to Oldacre and the rest of his family followed suit. By the time the 1881 census was held he had given up the farm, left Staffordshire and become an "accountant's clerk". He and his family lived in a house in Church Lane in Marple in Cheshire. Everard, who was still a schoolboy, is listed in the census as Edward E. Oldacre! His brother Albert was a railway clerk while Walter Lionel was an apprentice. In 1891 Everard and his parents were still living at Marple. His father is described in the census as a "land agent". Everard, who was a warehouse clerk, is listed as Ernest Oldacre. Maud, who had returned to live at home, was a schoolmistress. By 1901 Walter and Helen had retired to Southport in Lancashire, and Maud had moved to South Manchester, where she was a district nurse. Everard (now listed as Ernest E. Oldacre) lived with her and worked a cashier at a glass works. It seems likely that he was often called Ernest in preference to Everard.
Everard (or Ernest) married Mary Connard at the Parish Church of Musbury between Accrington and Bury in Lancashire on July 8, 1902, when he was 30 years old. The marriage certificate records that he was a secretary, living at the Vicarage at nearby Helmshaw. Mary, who was a year older than Everard, was living in Southport and was the daughter of David Connard, a deceased decorator. His eldest sister, Gertrude Oldacre, attended the wedding.
In 1928 Sussex County Magazine published a photograph by Oldacre of Old Shoreham Bridge as a two-page spread.
Oldacre died on February 4, 1940 at his home, Little Coldharbour, at Spinney Lane roundabout at Pulborough, leaving effects of £1305. He described himself in his will as a "gentleman", which suggests that he enjoyed private means. He was survived by his wife, Mary, who was granted probate in the name of Mary Oldacres.To directory of publishers

For George Gershwin’s "I Got Rhythm," the singer provides a minute and a half from a scratchy 50-year old vocal demo with piano accompaniment to introduce the big band’s arrangement. Again in Basie band fashion, the transition evolves with sudden powerful bursts from the orchestra; fifty years zoom by in one fell swoop.
Like all of Dave Frishberg’s music, "I Want to be a Sideman" contains poignant lyrics guaranteed to bring a smile to your face. Brief solo spots by Scotty Barnhart and guest Gary Foster are colored by lyrics such as:
"Now, I can cut whatever comes up, Fake and transpose, won’t make a fuss. I want to set the vibes and drums up, Sightread the shows, sleep on the bus."
and later,
"I want to sleep in afternoons. And let the leader call all the tunes. I want to be young. I want to have fun. I want to be a sideman."
The instrumental solo spots are brief, intended to provide punctuation and form. Even the addition of Barry Manilow on "How About You" serves merely to embellish an otherwise stellar session with singer and big band sharing their love of classic songs. Recommended.

The Piezocone in Lightly Over Consolidated Clay
Summary
A laboratory experimental programme was carried out to investigate the behaviour of the piezocone in lightly over consolidated clay. The clay samples were prepared from reconstituted kaolin. The powdered form of this clay was mixed with water to form a slurry at a moisture content of approximately 120% under vacuum. The clay slurry was consolidated and then allowed to swell in chambers which were well instrumented.
Penetration tests were carried out with two sizes of piezocones. The smaller piezocone had a cross sectional area of 1cmý with pore pressure measurement at the cone shoulder. The larger piezocone with a cross sectional area of 5cmý had pore pressure measurements at four locations.
In addition to penetration testing, further information on the strength and consolidation characteristics of the test chamber samples was obtained form shear vane, restricted flow consolidation, flow pump permeability and consolidated undrained triaxial tests.
The horizontal effective stress and the vertical stress ratio were found to influence the generated excess pore pressure at all four different locations on the piezocone shaft and the net tip resistance. This led to the establishment of direct correlations for the tip resistance factor Q with the coefficient for lateral earth pressure at rest Ko and the vertical effective stress ratio (OCR). Direct correlations for the excess pore pressure ratio at all four measuring positions with Ko and OCR were also established.
Several methods of estimating over consolidation ratio were also examined. One of the factors examined was Bq which was found to correlate poorly with OCR before tending asymptotically to a value of approximately 0.4. Other examples of factors which showed promising results as estimators of OCR were Bmi, the excess pore pressure ratio, and Q, the tip resistance factor.
The excess pore pressures well behind the cone shoulder, which are partly generated by the shear stress in the area, showed promising correlations with the undrained shear strength. However, because correlations with pore pressure on the piezocone are dependent upon the position of the filter element, the particular results from this series may only be sued for piezocones whose filter elements are at equivalent positions.
The undrained strength ratio was also correlated with the tip resistance factor Q and the result was very promising for future interpretation. of piezocone data.

Ups and Downs
Mia has been struggling with some eating issues recently. She's started to throw up at meals again and we're not sure why. We saw her GI doctor today and we're going to lower her miralax dose while upping some natural laxative foods. It's something I've wanted to try for awhile anyway, so I'm ready to see what happens this month. We are also going to be doing more cream in her pediasure and hoping this will help boost her calories. He's concerned because she isn't gaining weight. It's just so hard with her, sometimes she'll be doing well and sometimes she won't. And he told me she should be getting close to 1400 calories a day. We are lucky if we get to 1000-1200 calories a day. It just seems like such a huge hurdle right now. So, please pray for us. When I get overwhelmed like this, I just look over our blog for the past 3, almost 4 years and it's so evident to me how God has carried us through every day and it helps me to regain focus on who's in control and to put my trust in His plan for Mia. But, we can still use all the extra prayers too!

I wanted to share with you photos of our Wisteria this year.
The blooms last about 3 weeks,
depending on the weather.
We have two wisterias up on our hill and
two growing next to our house.
The flowers are a very pretty violet color.
They also have the sweetest smell.
They're a great addition to your garden.
Inside the house,
I made a little vignette with a Garden Theme.
The garden girl statue is wearing a pretty daisy headband.
Jute and scissors displayed in glass jars.
A garden sign, branches from a flowering quince and
an old vintage watering can
greets everyone at the front door.

Carly and Scott brought us some fresh breads
from San Francisco.
This country loaf was from Tartine Bakery.
They were delicious.
And some sweet treats!!

Starting your own small business can, at the same time, be both the most exciting and scary thing you ever do! Even if you are confident about your business idea, the next step of organizing your business resources can drain both your confidence and your energy! It always helps to have a sense of the major priorities, to ensure that nothing’s forgotten and if that’s the point you’re at, then have a quick check over these business resource must-haves:
Business plan:
Basically this is a document which outlines what your business intends to do, including:
- details of your product or service, including manufacture, staffing and costs.
- your market research, which may include a comparison of local competitors and market viability study.
- the important details of the financial aspects of your business, including projected income and outlay.
This sounds a daunting document to create from scratch- so don’t! Invest some time researching business plans on-line and you’ll be pleasantly surprised – there are lots of templates available which are free to download. These can offer a greater or lesser degree of detail but most are easily adaptable to suit your needs. Some examples are even industry specific so if, for instance, you are planning to start up a cleaning company or a catering business, you should be able to find templates and examples of business plans in these specific areas.
Finance:
Most small businesses require some investment of capital in order to get started. A business start-up loan can be applied for from most banking or financial institutions, but you will need to have already drawn up your business plan so that you can show these lenders both that you are serious about your venture and that you have completed your research, so therefore can speak knowledgeably about the local or national market that you wish to compete in.
Even if you are self-financing, you will need to have a ‘float’ of savings behind you, not only to invest in outlay for setting up your company, but also so that you can be sure of meeting your own domestic bills during the period where your business is not fully up and running (until the point where it is earning you an income). You must be prepared for the fact that this can take upwards of six months, so you should ensure that you have enough savings to keep you afloat (aim for at least a year if you can).
Insurance;
Do check all aspects of insurance as you move into setting up your business. Consider:
- Changes to your home insurance: if you have set up a home office, are trading from home, or even holding stock in your garage, check with your insurer to make sure that your policy covers this. If your current policy doesn’t, then update it so that these items are included. It’s bad enough putting your home back to rights after an accident or burglary, imagine having to get your livelihood back on track too!
- Business insurance: if you are trading from a retail or office unit where customers and clients visit you, or you are providing a service that goes to the customer’s location, make sure that this is covered by a specific insurance, such as public liability insurance. Any good broker should be able to identify cheap business insurance that covers the basics that you will need, but if you have a very specific business idea, you may want to talk directly to some insurers to identify who can offer you both the best deal for the maximum cover.
These three are the mainstay business resources for whatever industry or market you are planning to join. Pay plenty of attention to preparing these three properly then you and your business can have a firm foothold as you step into the wide world of business! Good luck!

~MelindaWill we still praise the sun in Bloodborne?
A couple weeks before E3 2014 leaks of Fromsoftware’s next game leaked online on two separate occasions titled Project Beast. Said game was announced at Sony’s press event under the title Bloodborne as an effort between Fromsoftware and SCE Japan Studio as an exclusive for the PS4. This co-development is nothing new for Fromsoftware as they had a similar partnership with SCE for Demon’s Souls. Hidetaka Miyazaki, who directed both Demon’s Souls and Dark Souls, has been working on Bloodborne since the release of Fromsoftware’s Artorias of the Abyss DLC in 2012.
Statement from Bloodborne.”
What we know of Bloodborne is little, but still enough to get excited over.
- They are replacing magic with gadgets, guns and such, but this isn’t just an aesthetic palette swap. The game will have a faster feel to it compared to Dark Souls.
- No shields! This is the biggest departure from the previous souls game, but the change in intended to make for a game more about proper positioning and timely dodges. I know for myself this change will take the greatest getting used to.
- Weapons Transform. Depending on how a weapon is used its move set and appearance will alter. As displayed at E3, a saw like blade could switch into a scythe, chaning the play style of combat entirely. This transformation option will be integrated into every weapon, and be an integral part in boss fights.
- Bells! Whenever they ring the enemy placements throughout the environment change. So memorizing an area until you got it down pat is no longer the status quo. You’ll need to stay alert even on subsequent playthroughs.
- No easy mode. And we like it that way.
- Main mechanic seems to be related to blood and blood is also used to regain your HP and gain various other benefits.
- Over eating transforms you into a beast.
- The game will become harder in some fashion when playing as a beast. I’m looking forward to all beast runs.
- Human blood is required to revert back to normal, and that is where the online component comes into play.
Some gameplay footage from a closed E3 demoChild Maintenance Application Fees.
The Minister for Pensions, Steve Webb MP, this week announced the introduction of charges for people applying to the Child Maintenance Service. Information on the implementation of other changes, including the introduction of collection charges, is also now available. In brief:
- All new applicants to the Child Maintenance Service from 30 June 2014 will be charged a one-off application fee of £20.
This application fee will not apply to clients who
- are a victim of domestic violence and have reported this to an appropriate person or organisation, including a solicitor
- are residents of Northern Ireland or
- are aged under 19.
From 11 August 2014 collection charges will be charged to both parents in relation to all cases in the Child Maintenance Service Collect and Pay system on or after that date.
The charges will be 4% deducted from the child maintenance payments received the parent with care and 20% added on to the child maintenance liability for the non-resident parent.
Resolution has been informed by the DWP that the Child Maintenance Service is writing to all CMS clients (around 120,000 cases) advising them of the introduction of collection charges from 11 August 2014 and flagging up the free Direct Pay option and how to apply for this (or, in the case of parents with care, how to express an option to stick with Collect and Pay if they still want this).
You can find examples of the letters being sent to clients on the DWP website
Existing clients already within the Collect and Pay system have ‘a choice’ or ‘a cooling off period’ to allow them to avoid paying collection charges from 11 August 2014. They can decide whether to continue using the Collect and Pay system and be charged, or to avoid the collection fee by either working out arrangements between themselves or using the free Direct Pay system.
- CMS Non-resident parents with arrears (but no enforcement action as yet) will be given until 5 August 2014 to clear their arrears. If they do so, they will be able to opt for a Direct Pay arrangement.
- Enforcement charges against paying parents will apply within the Child Maintenance Service taken on or after 30 June 2014, where the Child Maintenance Service has to take enforcement action against non-payers in the Collect and Pay system.
These charges will not apply to existing enforcement action taken prior to 30 June 2014.
We will be monitoring the impact of the charges and will keep you informed of any developments.
Ending CSA arrangements
- First contact to ‘nil assessed’ clients also began on 30 June – all clients will be notified by letter, they won’t be receiving a phone call or email.
We will be providing further information on CSA case closure arrangements.

You find yourself unable to go makeup commando for a gym session. You don't want to be that girl that looks like she's about to hit a club on the treadmill. By using a few basic and necessary tools, it's easy to look your best and most importantly, look natural at the gym.
Steps
- 1Apply waterproof mascara. Probably one of the best inventions ever created, it does what it says and never fails (except when it's time to wash it off and it sticks to each lash like black glue). Even just a few coats will make your eyes appear larger and more defined.
- 2Do your eyebrows. If you don't know how to pencil your eyebrows you need to learn. Eyebrows are so important to the face. You can learn how to pencil yours easily with the help of makeup gurus on YouTube. Make sure you choose a shade that isn't too dark and goes with your hair colour.
- 3Apply lip stain. Lips can often go pale and dry when you are working up a sweat. To avoid this look, try sweeping a few coats of lip stain on before hitting the gym. The body shop carry’s a wonderful lip and cheek stain for a reasonable price. To keep it fresh, use Vaseline and pat your lip with a sheet of toilet paper, to rid them of any unwanted shine. You should strive for colour; you don’t want anything shiny or fake looking.
- 4Use concealer as needed. If you can find waterproof concealer, then you struck gold. Stores like Sephora or Ulta carry products that look natural and do the job. Cover any spots or pimples with a concealer to keep your complexion on point.
- 5Don't forget blush or bronzer. Sweep on a light amount of bronzer or blush or both if your complexion allows it. This brightens your skin up and looks natural when done right.
- 6Go work out! It's not a sin to want to feel good at the gym, and for most of us, that means looking good. People praise the women who can confidently bare all, but that is just not possible for some. Don't over-do it with makeup at the gym! You don't want to be that girl that looks like she's headed to the bar; go primer can be used to ensure that your makeup will last throughout the workout.
- Wearing too much makeup is much worse than wearing little.
- Moisturize before putting any makeup on.
- Get out there and sweat! After all, you're there to workout and tone your body. There's a time and a place for everything and dark makeup isn't for the gym.
- Don't worry! Nobody is looking at how little makeup you're wearing.
Warnings
- Don't ever gloss the heck out of those lips before any cardio.
- A high ponytail will always look good; don't overdo your hair either.
- You don't need dark eye-shadows when going to a gym.
- There's no need for any jet-black eyeliner.

It all started with Allmendinger bump-drafting Elliot, sending his Chevy towards the wall. Then, Allmendinger's car got turned onto its side and then onto its roof as a pack formed behind them.
"Once I got to Chase I got loose," Allmendinger said. "I barely tapped him. I tried to get off him at that point. It was too late. It's Talladega. I'm not a big fan of it. You're up front, and you've got a chance to go for it, and racing happens."
According to USA Today, there were no injuries among the pack, and after leaving the care center, the two drivers that initiated the crash had a short discussion among themselves.
Wow New hyundai kona small crossover, this is it!"He just apologized," said Elliot. "I don't know that it was really his fault, per se. He had a big run and kind of got to my bumper and was in a bad spot. He was skewed a little to my left rear. When that happens, it just unloads these cars too much."
After the incident, NASCAR red-flagged the race for almost 27 minutes in order to clean up the track. Source:Milan hotels in Città Studi

It is our passion to gather small groups of people so that people have the unique opportunity to know Christ, grow in their faith and make Him known.
Our Sunday morning LIFE Groups are for all age groups and we meet at church at 9:30am.

I really loved this story. It was a super quick read and it only took me a few hours to finish it. I loved the characters and where it took place. The author did a great job at making me believe I was there and going through what they were going through. I am glad that it all worked out in the end. I am for sure going to be checking more books for this author out.

Work from home IndiaOn the back of my last post i’ve been thinking a lot about how I can transform my classroom to better cater for the kids of todays world. To foster and encourage creativity and innovation and have them engaged within a learning environment that breaks away from the norm and gives them a sense of belonging.
So after ‘sketch noting’ up a storm, see below ;), i’ve attempted to mockup a learning environment using my current space that reflects 21st Century teaching and learning. I love the whole notion of learning space and learning space design and love seeing how other educators have their learning spaces set up.
Having heard him countless times and even had the opportunity to work alongside him, Stephen Heppell is a person whose ideology around what learning spaces look and feel like are well noted. His website at contains great information about all things learning space design and i have certainly adopted some of his thinking.
Documents such as those shared below via a dropbox folder are also great reads, albeit a little ‘departmentalised’, yet give clear insights into what perhaps an effective learning space can be and or should be. If this is the case though within these documents why are more school classrooms not like this…? The million dollar question!
The TEDx Talk below via Sean Corcorran is a great 17min watch and hearing Sean’s thoughts and philosophies relating to some of the thinking that goes into learning space design is terrific.
To cap this post off and on the back of my image below, i simply thought that I would describe my ideal classroom. Some, if not all, is certainly achievable and time to implement at least some of the below will be the only obstacle!
Here we go…
“I want a classroom space that belongs to my students. A space that they want to come to because it is safe, exciting and has purpose. Furniture is to be mixed and not all the same to cater for various learners. Bean bags, collaborative tablespaces, standing height benches, moveable seating, writable surfaces (walls and tables), and isolation, or independent, break out spaces are to be all complemented with natural lighting. I am also a big fan of ‘rooms within rooms’ for student to break away from what is happening in class and to have an environment that lessens interruptions to their learning. A great example of this is via the work Matt Ives, an educator from New Zealand is doing around Design Thinking, his blog can be located here.
I’d also love to have furniture that encourages physical activity, such as having to climb, crawl, or whatever it may be to gain access to a specific space. The examples below I think would be awesome! I think also having exercise machines such as exercise bikes in the classroom would also be fantastic and I am certain that they’d get used!
Here are three older images I located showing just a few of the things I mentions happening at my College.
Students, like those who work at Google, are to also have constant access to food and snacks throughout the day. We as adults are not restricted and told when to eat, our students should not be either. Obviously a focus geared towards healthy eating and brain food will be encouraged and not 500ml Cans of Red Bull!
Within the class there is to be a ‘makerspace‘ to foster and encourage student innovation and creativity that is NOT confined to the curriculum being taught. This also will be relevant towards teaching students to code within year levels where it is not stated within the curriculum. The use of other technologies to drive some of the above (MaKey MaKey, Arduino, iBeacon Tech, etc…) will certainly drive some very powerful learning. The greatest inventors of out time were never restricted to a syllabus!
To make the space personal I would like students to share achievements regarding things that they have achieved outside of school. To see their interests and passions that drive who they are and then for them to bring these passions into the classroom. My classroom would also be shoeless (A Heppell philosophy), to ensure comfort levels are optimum. I would also have no college/school uniform however I think that will be my one major sticking point. 😉 This all relates to the classroom belonging to the students.
My classroom would also be technology rich. Students having access to multiple devices, especially with an emphasis on using their own. I would have charging stations (OH&S, meh…), and a range of other attachments to suit individual learning needs. I would have a mobile LED TV, preferably interactive, that students could airplay, mirror their devices to. I would want this mobile so as to not make it the main point of the room. It would be flexible enough that I could use it with 1, 5, 10, or the whole class. I could turn it so others could not see it so as to not distract. In saying this it is exactly what I have now, apart from the interactivity, and it is brilliant! Also, and another point I heard off Mr. Heppell, is that I’d love to have ‘Skype’ or ‘Google Hangout’ bars. PLaces where students could interact and connect with others wherever they may be. Why should learning be limited to only the classroom and what is on the internet. Why should students not be able to connect with other experts, no matter where they are! As the American Educator Will Richardson puts it… “There are approx. 2.5 Billion People online. This can be seen as 2.5 billion predators, or, 2.5 billion teachers… You choose.”
Students would have the opportunity to present their work/findings/understandings in ways which play to their strengths and that also encourage a greater global audience.
I think that i’ll stop here. I could perhaps go on but for now, if my classroom was everything that I have just mentioned above, I would be a pretty happy man. I think that my students would be even happier though!Debt Consolidation

Tuesday’s Tale of Terror October 21, 2014
Consider yourself invited to an intimate dinner party among the elegant and artistic Parisian society at the home of Marquise de Strada, a woman of enduring beauty and flamboyance. Our narrator recounts the evening’s occult events in the Marquise’s drawing room. The guests decide to contact the spirit world. One of the guests, Henri, suggests they try a method of evocation called ‘the spectral hand.’ Beneath the flickering light of one lamp in the shape of an owl, this group attempts to conjure the dead.
“This is what must be done,’ Henri continued. ‘I shall attempt to invoke an invisible presence, requesting it to manifest itself by means of a sensation of coldness. Whichever one of us experiences that sensation most keenly is the one who is chosen to be summoned. His duty is to get up, and extend his hand into the gap between the curtains, into the dark void beyond.”
In terms of 19th century literature of the French Decadent Movement, author Jean Lorrain was well known. Openly homosexual and accused of perversity, bad taste, misogyny, anti-Semitism and much more, he wrote some thirty short stories, titles like The Glass of Blood, The Spirit of the Ruins, The Possessed, Prey to Darkness, The Locked Room. His most famous novel is Monsieur De Phocas. Sarah Bernhardt wrote to him “inside the abominably depraved being that you are, there beats the heart of a great artist, a genuinely sensitive and tender heart.”
A collection of his short stories is Nightmares of an Ether Drinker (which Lorrain was and presumably died of an overdose.)
Some readers consider Lorrain to be a breathtaking storyteller. How did you feel reading this short story? Could you tell the author was this dark?
Read The Spectral Hand in Late Victorian Gothic Tales (PDF, scroll to page 177, very short read).One of my favorite publications is the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). It’s put out weekly by the CDC and allows for rapid communication of emerging or interesting health trends. This week the CDC is reporting an extraordinary death rate from influenza in American Indians/Native Alaskans (AI/NA). Collecting data like this presents several challenges, including under-reporting of AI/NA ethnicity and under-reporting of H1N1 as a cause of death, which makes the data even more sobering.
The death rate from H1N1 among AI/NA is 3.7 per 100,000 population, compared with 0.9 per 100,000 for all other ethnicities combined. This is probably an under-estimate.
Many native populations carry a high burden of high-risk health problems such as diabetes which are associated with complications of influenza. In fact, NA/AI have twice the rate of diabetes as the rest of the population (over 45%). However, the trend of H1N1 mortality is also true for other indigenous populations, such as native Australians. This would seem to implicate poverty, marginalization, and other social factors in the disparity in mortality.
In some ways, this is a good thing. We can’t change genetics, but we can improve social disparities—if we really want to.Has anyone landed from altitude with both engines out? If so, what was it like?
What were the flight characteristics like?
daffy1029 @ Aug 8 2005, 08:08 PM wrote: Hi Art,
With a Lazair, you have around 12:1 glide ratio, which is very good in helping to find fields to land in (depending on your altitude). As far as flying without engines, it's not to much different than with engines. If fact, one of my first solo flights, I had an engine stop, as I was climbing. Since I had no experience with single engine flight, I elected to shut off the good engine and pointed the nose down to maintain airspeed. I simply glided to an open field beneath me and made a perfect landing in a plowed field. I stopped in about 40 feet. I was a little shook up, as I was very new to flying and was not expecting engine trouble so soon. All it was that caused the engine to quit was the nuts, holding the carb on, backed off! I lockwire them now(Rotax 185's).
I actually go up to higher altitudes now and then, and shut the engines off for practice. I have practiced single engine flying and find it fairly easy to handle. Depending on the conditions, you can maintain altitude with one Jpx engine (winter). With the Rotax 185, I could never quite maintain level flight, but it sure extends your glide! Such a wonderful plane to fly. Daffy

Verizon will pay the NFL more than $2 billion under the new deal, the Wall Street Journal reported; Reuters pegged it at around $2.25 billion over the five-year period, citing an anonymous source. The renewed and expanded pact will run through the 2022-23 season. Under the prior deal, Verizon has paid around $250 million per year ($1 billion total over the four-year span).
The new Verizon-NFL deal covers all in-market and national games, including preseason, regular season, and playoff games — including the Super Bowl — available to anyone in the U.S., on any mobile carrier or network provider. The package includes live-streaming rights to the NFL’s Thursday, Sunday and Monday Night Football games, and the Sunday day games that air on TV in viewers’ local market.
Verizon’s rights extend to mobile phones across all carriers and across Oath properties, including Yahoo, Yahoo Sports, AOL, and Go90. According to the company, its mobile and digital properties reach more than 200 million monthly unique users in the U.S. The new NFL deal also grants Verizon rights to sell select in-game ad inventory on its platforms.
Essentially, Verizon is getting U.S. multiplatform live-streaming rights to the entire NFL schedule — with the exception of Sunday afternoon out-of-market games. Those remain with AT&T’s DirecTV, which has locked up the NFL Sunday Ticket package through the end of the 2022-23 season.
“We’re making a commitment to fans for Verizon’s family of media properties to become the mobile destination for live sports,” Lowell McAdam, chairman and CEO of Verizon Communications, said in a statement. “The NFL is a great partner for us and we are excited to take its premier content across a massive mobile scale so viewers can enjoy live football and other original NFL content where and how they want it.”
TV broadcast rights, however, are still where the NFL makes its mint. The league rakes in an estimated $7 billion per year from TV deals, including with CBS, Fox, NBC and ESPN, representing about half its overall revenue.
The full extent of the new Verizon-NFL deal won’t go into effect until the 2018-19 season, but certain elements will roll out this postseason. Specifically, NFL postseason games will be available on Yahoo, Yahoo Sports, and Go90 (along with the NFL Mobile app) beginning no later than the conference championships on Jan. 21.
NFL commissioner Roger Goodell, in a statement, praised Verizon as a partner and emphasized that the deal will extend the league’s games to any mobile device “regardless of carrier.” Verizon has carried NFL games on mobile since 2010.
In addition to the expanded availability of live games, the new NFL-Verizon agreement encompasses mobile access to NFL highlights, coverage of NFL throughout the week and year, and a set of jointly developed original content (like virtual-reality experiences). Verizon has global distribution rights to the on-demand content, while the live games are U.S.-only.
Under the pact, Verizon also will continue to be the official wireless sponsor of the NFL while the telco’s media brands like Yahoo will become official NFL sponsor brands as well. Also, starting with the 2018 NFL season, Verizon will become the presenting sponsor of the Pro Bowl and the NFL Scouting Combine.
Verizon formed the Oath digital-media group this summer, combining AOL and Yahoo under one umbrella, after closing the $4.5 billion acquisition of Yahoo in June 2017.
The NFL has divvied up the rights to its crown jewels — the live games — across TV and digital partners for the last several years. This past season, it granted Amazon worldwide streaming rights to the 11-game “Thursday Night Football” lineup for a reported $50 million (after Twitter had “TNF” in 2016). And Verizon paid the league around $20 million to live-stream a single regular-season game (the Sept. 24 Ravens-Jaguars meeting in London), paying a premium because it wasn’t broadcast nationally in the U.S.
Verizon’s $2 billion NFL rights deal comes as tech players including Facebook, Amazon, and Twitter are looking to spend big bucks to bring more sports to their digital services. Facebook is said to be particularly aggressive: The social giant is seeking to hire an exec who will have a budget of a “few billion dollars” for sports-rights deals, Sports Business Journal reported last month.(

Introduction: Paper Castle
The castle techniques or tips and can be achieved by strategic placement of paper onto the embossing folder, as shown in the images used for the door and the other areas. The inking process of the parts is similar, but different colors are used.
Emboss door using Spellbinders Diamond Fleur de Lis M-Bossabilities™ Folder. Align paper as shown below. (For instruction regarding proper use of M’Bossabilities™ Folders in the Grand Calibur, please visit Spellbinders Paper Arts helpful How-To Videos: M’Bossabilities™.)
Using a Sponge Dauber, sponge door with Desert Sand Memento™ Dye Ink.
Apply theBrilliance Galaxy Gold Ink direct from ink pad to paper in long swipes.
Add details with a Precise V5 pen. The Precise V5 pen writes fine over the pigmented inks. Age with Toffee Crunch Memento™ Ink using a Sponge Dauber.
Add Tim Holtz Idea-ology Mini Fasteners to holes in door.
Note: These Sponge Daubers can be washed and re-used, and can be used with different colors.
Trim and Vaulted Entrance
Align paper as shown below.
Sponge on Toffee Crunch Memento™ Dye Ink with a Sponge Dauber.
Apply Mediterranean Blue and Rocket Red Brilliance Inks to desired areas.
Rub in inks with a paper towel. Directly from the ink pad to the paper swipe pieces with Brilliance Galaxy Gold Ink.
Sponge on Pearlescent Lime and Starlight Silver with Sponge Dauber. Rub in with paper towel, using the reverse side of the M’Bossabilities™ folder and align paper as shown below.
The vaulted entrance is arrows.
Ink towers with layers of with Pearlescent Lavender and Starlite Silver Brilliance Inks, and Memento™, so match them up prior to gluing with Bonding Memories Broad Tip Glue Pen. Do not glue the lower the inside of the lower portion on each side of the flags, and adhere to turrets.
Finishing Details
Add “mortar” look by sponging on Goosebumps Shimmer Texture Spray with a paper towel and liberally applying Beacon Adhesives “3-in-1 Advanced Craft Glue” to areas where walls and towers meet, wherever there are seams. The glue interacts with color.
Spritz the entire castle liberally Goosebumps Shimmer Texture Spray and sprinkle Cloud 9 Microfine Opaque Glitter. Let dry completely. This final application of products gives the castle a light dusting of snow and really makes the castle sparkle. The Goosebumps Shimmer Texture Spray dries raised, and looks like ice.
Because no castle is complete without jewels, add Teardrop Bling in clusters to look like flowers. Add LaCreme Pearls to flags and above each of the front windows.”
This is stunning! I can't even image the time this took to put together...fabulous!!
This is so pretty! Thank you so much for sharing your hard work and do have a splendorous day!

Should I buy VolksWagen Polo comfortline diesel?...
show more servicing cost I can bare, but if it goes beyond that, then it will be overload for me.....please suggest
VW POLO is a driver's car,no doubt it is one of the best premium hatchbacks in india. If u ralph lauren sweatshirts 2014
need a car for pure driving fun,great driving control with impressive technology and quality POLO is the best.
But CAUTION this car needs maintanance and is not that comfortable as compared to other hatchbacks as it is a Driver's car. new or used? for the most part, the engineering and oem parts are very good, on VW. for that they have (or get to) charge a bit more up front. regular maintenace is key to most any vehicle long term usefullness. the quality spares cost more, there is fewer required, less often, on a diesel. i dont know, and cannot say as to the market there, hear that the MOT inspection can be rather unforgiving. generally i will agree that that cheap products, dont last. rather like a toaster on wheels. some just are made to be used lightly, short time, toss out and get a new one. a solid car, that is comfortable, and pleasant to drive, will be a smarter investment, in my world. cars.com has pretty good research data, i would say to get more varied info, see what works for you. in the end its still partly emotion, drive the car, see if it feels right, that you will be happy living with it for a long while. best to ya. You need to first find a reliable VW mechanic you trust.
Then have them inspect the car.
Diesels are very low maintenance and very reliable.
But dealers are always too expensive, with any car.
I would not worry about the engine.
If the transmission is automatic, that would worry me more.
Engines can easily be swapped with salvage parts.
Automatic transmissions in salvage yards are not reliable enough to use.The programme includes the premiere of the Sound in the Silence 2017 documentary. co-organiser.

One such exclusive product that is inevitable for pool maintenance is filter. Pool filters with replacement cartridges have caught the fancy of people who are regular pool users. The cartridge filters are durable pool products and hence their deployment in home ponds help to solve a lot of problems associated with swimming ponds.
The longevity of pool increases with the installation of such new filters. They are also easy to buy as they are made available at discounted prices. People are found to visit the websites of various manufacturers such as Hayward, Astral, Harmsco, Jacuzzi and others. There are many retailer sites too where discounts on filters of these brands are available. They can be easily purchased by placing online orders for any pool product.
Such pool equipment is a complete solution for maintenance of ponds. The reason is that the filters help to maintain the chemical balance of water, avoid contamination of ponds, cleans the water used and promotes safety from microbial attack and bacterial formations.
The best part about the filters is that it uses its cartridge filament to trap dirt particles that are very minute in size. Clogging accelerates in such filters as the filtering medium is capable of trapping 4 -5 microns dirt. This enhanced cleaning ability is what makes the new filters absolutely marvelous. There is no reason why pond's safety won't get exalted after such sophisticated filters are installed in swimming ponds.
The popularity of cartridge filters is growing rapidly and people no longer want to depend on backwashing and refilling DE for pond cleaning. Instead they love to adapt to the new cartridge filters whereby things can be simplified as clogged cartridges can now be replaced.As we reported in previous issues, BP threw another firebomb on the Settlement Program by attempting to remove Claims Administrator Pat Juneau from his role as overseer of the settlement. Curiously, BP made this move notwithstanding two audits that confirmed the process was being implemented correctly, as well as numerous court decisions rejecting BP’s contentions that the Claims Administrator was improperly administrating the settlement. With its previous settlement interpretation arguments in ruins, BP sought to remove Mr. Juneau based upon a claim that he had a conflict of interest and failed to disclose the conflict to BP.
Predictably, these claims were proved to be completely untrue. In fact, Court documents established that there was no conflict and, further, the supposed “conflict” was known by BP even before Mr. Juneau took control of the Program. Frankly, BP was making this argument because it had no other argument to make. Just a few months before filing its motion to remove Mr. Juneau, an independent audit of the Claim Center’s activities concluded that 99.5 percent of claims were being processed correctly. Faced with the possibility of being seen as petty before the Fifth Circuit, BP dropped its effort to remove Juneau.
BP made the obvious and right decision to drop this appeal, but the company’s effort is another in a long line of examples of how far it will go to get what it wants. BP’s contentions were completely ridiculous, but the purpose was clear – disrupt the Facility to slow payments down and intimidate the Claims Administrator. Sadly, more money was spent on legal briefs and bully tactics instead of putting the money in the hands of Gulf Coast citizens. The more things change the more they stay the.Buy new best Bca Float from $12.8

Very pretty, thank you can't get over how adorable this necklace made by Lisa Leonard is with its little chirpy bird. Pretty and simple.
I like these recycled lucite earrings made into vintage shapes. For $15.00 that's a great price. The maker Sierra Bailey of Manic Trout has many other great and affordable pretties to wear. Take a look at all her fab creations, they are stylish and fun, I dare you to resist loving them.

Snooping
The Story
The ACLU is not quite over the revelation of the government’s surveillance programs and has filed a lawsuit regarding one of the programs.
theSKIMM
This is the first major lawsuit following the leaks about the government’s two big programs last week. The ACLU has already expressed its horror at the National Security Agency’s legit collection of phone records from Verizon. One problem the NSA might not have thought of? As luck would have it, the American Civil Liberties Union says it’s a Verizon customer and its constitutional rights have been violated . As for the other big leak—that the NSA also gets info from major internet companies— Google, Facebook, and Microsoft would like to tell users all about the government’s requests, but they can’t without the government’s permission. They have now officially asked for it.
Anything Uplifting?
Book sales are up! Sales of George Orwell’s 1984 have gone up anywhere between 3,000 and 6,000% (depending on whom you ask) on Amazon. So there’s that.
Sex & Drugs
The Story
An internal memo by an inspector general suggests higher-ups at the State Department may have interfered with or stopped investigations into some major, major misconduct by its staffers.
theSKIMM
Highlights of bad behavior include: Hillary Clinton’s security detail allegedly enjoying the company of prostitutes while abroad and an underground drug ring reportedly supplying security contractors with the goods in Iraq. The State Department said not to fret and that all allegations were very thoroughly investigated.

What to Say When Someone Brings up the NBA Finals
No more—let’s talk hockey. The Stanley Cup Finals start tonight with the Chicago Blackhawks battling the Boston Bruins in a classic matchup between two of the Original Six teams (read: first teams in the NHL). It will actually be the first time the two teams have faced off this season because of the NHL’s lockout, which caused a shortened schedule. The governors of Illinois and Massachusetts have decided to make a gentleman’s bet—loser will volunteer at a food bank of the winner’s choice. Yawn but still very nice.
What to Say When You See a Turtle
Slowly but surely, I’m sure you’ll do something. The Senate is now ready to start to debate immigration reform . This means onward with what could be the first major overhaul to immigration laws in a generation. The Senate bill would give the 11 million unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. a pathway to citizenship, add funds for stricter border security, and require employers to check on the status of new hires to make sure they’re legit. Critics don’t think it takes into account that making 11 million people legal is expensive or does enough to secure borders. The bill has a long way to go, including through the Republican controlled House, so yes, this is just a little step forward. Hold the applause.
What to Say to Your Boyfriend
I just wish you got me as much as M. Night Shyamalan does. Turns out the man behind The Happening and our favorite, After Earth , has a softer side. He just admitted that he ghost-wrote She’s All That . That’s right, the man who made us watch Lady in the Water also gifted us Freddie Prinze Jr. and choreographed prom dances. Don’t ever doubt yourself, Mr. Shyamalan. You clearly have a sixth sense about these things.

Computer parts layaway is the most practical way to replace and upgrade your pre-existing computer parts. It’s undeniable that most people live on a shoestring budget and it’s hardly easy to squeeze in your computer parts issues into it. Fortunately, there are many retailers and layaway services that offer computer parts layaway.
It’s true that giant retailers, like Kmart, and other popular computer brands, Dell, HP, and Apple, don’t offer parts for layaway. However, this doesn’t mean that your quest for a great computer parts layaway program should end up with nothing. If you search over the internet, different layaway services and retailers offer layaway programs that can be adjusted to match your budget and requests.
Despite the availability of layaway plans for computer parts, most consumers are still hesitant to take advantage of it. Most consumers are afraid that by the time the layaway period is over they’ll be getting obsolete parts for their computers – or so they thought.
ECLayaway (Electronic Components Layaway.com) is a first-rate online layaway shop that guarantees the best deals on products and great services. They recognize that computer technology involves a fast transitional phase. Their computer layaway program gives the consumer the privilege to upgrade the computer components, which have the same amount that the consumers agreed for, and they won’t charge any additional fees. Generally, by the time you receive the computer, you’ll be assured that its components are not outdated.
Like ECLayaway.com, TC Computers.com also offers a layaway program, which guarantees that you’ll only bring home computers with up-to-date parts. At the start of the program, they’ll discuss with you the options available to you and create a plan that revolves on the existing prices. On the event that new and better parts, like motherboards and processors, are available at the end of the layaway period, they will immediately replace your computer with those parts (as long as it has the matching price you locked in for).
Computer retailers, online and offline, have different policies on their layaway programs. Make sure that you carefully read through their online and offline policies – know the ins and outs before settling to one layaway service. Also, you don’t have to worry about bad credit problems because these retailers only require you to be of legal age (18 years and above) with a valid U.S. bank savings or account in order to qualify for their computer parts layaway program.

Valentines!! :)
Ahh....Valentines day! A lovely day to tell your loved ones how much you love them! Do you think it is a Hallmark day, like some? Or do you think it is a great day to remind yourself why you married the one you did, are dating the person you are, or are thankful for the kid you have? I myself, think it is a bit of both. My husband and I don't go all out, but we do celebrate it. We get our boy a little something and eachother a little something. Connor enjoys making decoartions and Valentines for his friends. I think it is great for kids to have days that are special like that and to be able to share things with them. They also need to know though that not just one day is for celebrating the ones you love! Every day is!! So I hope you and your family and loved ones all have a great Valentines Day and take that love throughout the whole year!!! :)

The new administrative head of BCCI, Vinod Rai, has told two senior officials from the old Board set up not to go for this week’s International Cricket Council meeting.cricket Updated: Jan 31, 2017 22:08 IST
In a major decision on Tuesday, BCCI treasurer Anirudh Chaudhary and joint secretary Amitabh Choudhary were told not to attend the crucial meeting of the International Cricket Council (ICC).
The reason behind Rai’s decision is not clear but the issue will be raised in the Supreme Court on Wednesday. Time, though, could be a constraint as the ICC meeting will be held in Dubai on Thursday.
The Supreme Court had ordered on Monday that banker Vikram Limaye, who was named in the four-member administrative panel, Anirudh and Amitabh can attend the ICC meeting where financial issues with major ramifications would be discussed as per the new governance structure of the world governing body.
BCCI administrative committee led by Vinod Rai met in Mumbai earlier today pic.twitter.com/hIjxE9Dg2V— ANI (@ANI_news) January 31, 2017
However, on Tuesday, it was learnt that the former Comptroller and Auditor General, Vinod Rai, who was appointed as the head of the administrators’ panel, informed that Limaye will represent BCCI at the meeting while Board CEO Rahul Johri would attend the ICC Chief executives’ meeting.
Calls to Anirudh and Amitabh went unanswered. Amitabh was also barred from chairing the senior selection meeting which picked the squad to face Bangladesh in the one-off Test starting on February 9.Index

Nerine
'Natasha'
The rain has thundered down, the wind has been rattling dead branches out of the trees and just down the road it has rattled a Chestnut Tree out of the ground. I was in a garden in Hampshire on Friday and they have already had their first frost. My sympathy goes out to all the gardeners who have been having a difficult season.
The bulb house is going through a change. The
Nerine
are expanding, the general bulbs are being pushed out. I had noticed that it was happening without any deliberate intention. I think I have to move with the times and accept that it has become a
Nerine
house.
'Natasha' stands head and shoulders above the crowd. I like these giants - 'Regina', 'Rushmere Star' and some of the Zeal cultivars. Hybrids involving
N. sarniensis
and other species (whose identity is often in doubt). So far none have set seed with me, I would love to breed some more. When I go looking for information about it, all I find is my own ignorance staring back at me through the mirror of the internet. Surely someone must know something?
(Perhaps it is recorded in a book, whatever they are.)

Galanthus
'Autumn Beauty'
The
Nerine
have almost complete control of their greenhouse. I can't see much else in there putting up a fight as they crush forward into the space. The only exception is the Autumn Snowdrops. They established a foothold just inside the door and they are expanding their control very slowly. For a few years now I have been buying new ones whenever I see them, but I can't see it getting out of hand. There really aren't very many. They seem to do much better under cover than they do in the open garden and I'm not enough of a purist to force them to suffer in the rain when I have a perfectly good (or at least reasonably adequate) greenhouse for them. I saw a few lovely gardens while I was away, but not a single snowdrop so I am satisfied (delighted) with my solution. Somebody somewhere will start breeding them and then I will need more space. Unfortunately, looking around at the moment, it may have to be me.
'Autumn Beauty' seems to be a small group of seedlings derived from a chance cross between
G. elwesii
and
G. reginae-olgae
. There is some variability among them, and all last year I promised myself that if I saw any more I would buy them. Wisley had five for sale on Friday and I turned my back. I still don't understand why. They weren't even very expensive. I think I was gripped by NACA (Nerine Anticipated Cost Anxiety).
16th October 2016
Galanthus reginae-olgae
'Tilebarn Jamie'
Most of the variation in Autumn Snowdrops seems to be coming from selections of
G. reginae-olgae
. It is the most successful of the species for the open garden. If I were to rephrase that and say it is the least disappointing then I think I would have got closer to the truth. There are some named selections with distinctive flowers, but most of the names refer to forms with reduced propensity to die in the garden.
'Tilebarn Jamie' was selected by Peter Moore and produces two large rounded flowers from a mature bulb. For me it has been vigorous and increased rapidly and I think it is where I would start if I wanted to raise a selection of seedlings. Perhaps that is a job for this afternoon. Some gentle hybridising in the sunshine - once I have bought some bread and unpacked the car from the trip away.
Perhaps the snowdrops will wait a few days after all.

Nerine
Exbury copper-lavender
Exbury is worth a visit at any time of the year but it is an overwhelming pleasure to visit when the Nerine are in flower. The collection consists mostly of
N. sarniensis
selections and hybrids, including many early cultivars raised at Exbury, a number raised by Sir Peter Smithers in Switzerland when the best of the collection went there, and many more raised since the collection returned.
Large numbers of seedlings have been raised and I am very grateful for their generosity. I have had this one for a few years and call it "Exbury copper-lavender" by way of identification. It has large un-twisted tepals and a strong stem. The flowers are coppery pink as they open but develop blue and lavender shades as they mature.
I got it as part of a deliberate plan to add more purple and mauve shades to my collection and this one was floating at the edge of the colour range when I first saw it. Exbury's breeding in the same range of colours has produced some of their strongest and most distinctive new cultivars.
In the event the NACA was overstated. I came away with a scarlet red seedling that is a better colour than anything else I have seen and a white one with strong upright stems. I was in the Exbury greenhouse when the rain hit, and pleased to be under cover.
As I say, my sympathy goes out to all gardeners having a difficult season.

- Super Nice!! My early 04 is rated at 225. later 04's were at 250. Curious, where is the sea chest on a 03? is it the newer design away from the tab?
- I bet it doesn't porpoise with the tabs down a little bit...all the time. I need to retract mine all the way for the trailer bunks, and I like to wheelie on the pad at 60... ha
LSS2 Transducer Placement
captpn replied to gambler1's topic in General Forumthis may help, its a similar hull and transducer. I put it in the pocket low and it works fine on plane. You could mount it higher to protect it, but it wont read above a fast idle.
- If the starboard side tab is lower on the hull due to the wedge, then on plane it will lift that side / You mention the boat usually needs starboard down for level (which is accomplished using the port tab -- by pressing right side switch) Makes sense to remove the wedge to level her. Hope that helps.

- Dang, yours is newer. (no change in the hulls, just an updated rating)
- That's the most important change. The design with the sea chest right next to the trim tab proved to be a weak spot on some well used boats. My 04 is rated at 225.

Steering Cable REPLACE
captpn replied to Timeflys's topic in General ForumIve done a few boats that were a pain. We used a motor hoist and unbolted it(only loosening the lower sliding bolts) from the transom to align the cable, keeping it fully rigged up. Made it a little easier.
What did you do to your boat today?
captpn replied to HewesYourDaddy's topic in General ForumI've been doing way too much 'Driveway Boating' lately is the main reason its clean. I just clean it up with some soap and bleach... and when not in use, leave it open so It breaths. Even when its under the cover, I turn the stainless latches and then close the lids so it keeps them open about a 1/2 inch... I think it helps prevent mold.Change is coming to Luzerne County government.
Three new members of county council will take their seats today, and council might also appoint a new chairperson.
Chris Perry, Sheila Saidman and Matthew Vough will be sworn in at 5:30 p.m. at the Luzerne County Courthouse. They, along with incumbents Linda McClosky Houck and Harry Haas, won four-year seats on county council in the Nov. 7 election.
The three new council members will fill the seats vacated by Kathy Dobash, Eileen Sorokas and Rick Williams, who did not seek re-election.
After the new members are sworn in, council will hold a reorganization meeting at 6 p.m.
The only items on the agenda are the election of a chairperson and vice chairperson.
There could be a changing of the guard.
Houck has served as chairwoman since January 2015, having previously served as vice chair.
Vice Chairman Tim McGinley, who served as council chairman from August 2012 to January 2014, is expected to be nominated for the chairmanship today.
McGinley did not return a message seeking comment on Monday. Houck declined to comment on the vote for the chairperson position.
Houck did say that whoever is elected chair by his or her peers needs to maintain separation between the legislative branch of government, represented by county council, and the administrative branch, represented by county Manager David Pedri and his administration.
The duties of both branches are outlined in the county home rule charter, according to Houck.
“The idea is that the chair should not be a daily presence in the courthouse,” she said. “The idea is we are the legislative body and the administration runs the county without interference from council.”
According to council’s bylaws, it takes six votes from the 11-member council to be named chair.
That could complicate today’s vote, if one or more council members do not attend the meeting or if more than two people are nominated to be chairperson.
Two years ago, council deadlocked 5-5 between Houck and McGinley in a vote to name a chairperson. With Councilman Stephen A. Urban absent, Councilman Eugene Kelleher changed his vote to Houck, effectively handing her the chair position.

by Henry M. Morris, Ph.D. * naming of an only begotten son is always an important event in the life of a family. In this intriguing set of questions, however, the prophet Agur (Proverbs 30:1) was particularly concerned to know the name of the Son of the very Creator of the universe, the one who had made the waters and the winds and all the ends of the earth.
In fact, he probably had been quite amazed when he first learned that God had a Son. As a prophet in Israel, he often must have repeated the great affirmation of Deuteronomy 6:4: "The LORD our God is one LORD," as well as the first commandment of the Decalogue: "Thou shalt have no other gods before me" (Exodus 20:3). How could it be that the God of creation would have a Son?
Nothing whatever is known about Agur except that God used him to write the fascinating and unique thirtieth chapter of King Solomon’s collection of proverbs. He was evidently a man of wisdom who loved the Lord, probably also a man well known and trusted by Solomon. He very likely knew David as well, or at least must have been acquainted with David’s psalms.
In David’s second psalm, there had been a profound reference to this divine Son. "The LORD hath said unto me, Thou art my Son; . . . and I shall give thee the heathen [i.e., 'the nations'] for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession" (Psalm 2:7-8).
Agur likely also had heard, from either David or Solomon, about God’s promise concerning David’s future seed: "He shall build an house for my name, and I will stablish the throne of his kingdom for ever. I will be his father, and he shall be my son" (2 Samuel 7:13-14; also 1 Chronicles 17:13). This enigmatic prophecy seemed in part to apply to Solomon, but its eternal dimensions clearly marked it as going far beyond Solomon to an even greater Son of David who would somehow also be the Son of God. In fact, from the vantage point of the New Testament (Hebrews 1:5), we now know that the statement "he shall be to me a son" applied specifically not to David’s son, Solomon, but to this very Son of God.
It is not surprising, therefore, that Agur would raise the question: "What is His Son’s name?" He also asked the name of the Creator, although he surely was very familiar with the several names applied to God in the writings of Moses—especially "God" (Elohim), "LORD" (Jehovah), and "Lord" (Adonai). But as Father to a Son, God must have another name as well. "What is His name?" he asked.
The Name of the Father
Although this question of Agur’s is never specifically answered in the Old Testament, this new name of the Lord is surely nothing less than "Father." It seems significant that although the word "father" (Hebrew, ab) occurs more than 500 times in the Old Testament, none of the writers ever addressed God as ab (or as abba, the Aramaic equivalent).
However, God did occasionally speak of Himself as Israel’s Father (e.g., Jeremiah 3:19, speaking prophetically of the future kingdom). On one occasion, Moses did remind Israel that Jehovah was also their ab because He had both made them and redeemed them from slavery (Deuteronomy 32:6). But this was probably the only biblical reference to God as Father which Agur could have heard in his time, except the above-mentioned references to God’s Son (2 Samuel 7:14; 1 Chronicles 17:13).
But then the Son of God finally did come into the world and the situation was altogether changed and clarified. On the night before His trial and crucifixion, He prayed for His disciples, saying: "Father, . . . I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world . . . Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou has given me, that they may be one, as we are. . . . O righteous Father, . . . I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare it" (John 17:1, 6, 11, 25-26). That name clearly was "our Father." When the Lord Jesus taught His disciples how to pray, He told them specifically to begin their prayer by addressing God as "our Father" (Matthew 6:9).
The New Testament word for "father" (Greek, pater) occurs about 500 times and was frequently used, both by Christ and the apostles, to refer to God as well as to human fathers. On one urgent occasion, the Lord Jesus prayed to His Father, saying: "Abba, Father" (Mark 14:36). This was in the Garden of Gethsemane just before His arrest. Although no one in the Old Testament would ever address God as "Abba," Christ did. This must have been the most intimate name for His Father in the innermost councils of the tri-une Godhead.
And now, by virtue of our own adoption through Christ, into God’s family, even we can—when the circumstances warrant it—use the same wonderful name when praying to our heavenly Father. ).
Perhaps this answers Agur’s question concerning the new name of God the Creator of the ends of the earth. But now we want to seek the answer to his second question. By what name is God’s Son to be called?
His Name Shall Be Called Wonderful
It would be almost 300 years after Solomon and Agur, however, before God would send another prophet with the answer. Then, through the wonderful prophet Isaiah, God delivered those two great prophecies that Christians rehearse over and over, at every Christmas season:
Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel. (Isaiah 7:14)
"Immanuel," of course, means "God with us," so this coming Son of the virgin would also be God incarnate in human flesh. Then, a short time later, God sent an amazing prophecy concerning the name of this Son.
For unto us [remember "God with us"] a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. (Isaiah 9:6)
What a name! Yet how appropriate for one whose name already had been stated as "God with us"—"Immanuel." This One who was promised would be a man, born of a Jewish maiden, yet also would be God, God in human flesh, God like us, God with us! How marvelous.
No wonder He is to be called "Wonderful." The connotation of the Hebrew word is "miraculous." God could never become man apart from a miraculous conception and virgin birth; otherwise, He would inherit a human sinful nature and thus could not be the uniquely holy God. His very name, indeed, must be "Wonderful."
Yet that alone is not enough. He was also to be mankind’s great Counselor, the One who could alone perfectly convey the grand nature of God’s holy standards couched in redeeming love to lost humanity. When He finally came, this God-man, speaking words of infinite wisdom phrased in childlike simplicity for all to understand, even God’s enemies found themselves acknowledging that "Never man spake like this man" (John 7:46).
Many scholars think that the sense of the prophecy really places the two words together—that is, "Wonderful Counsellor." This also is surely true; He was the "Miraculous Advisor" for every need of life, never having to retract or modify His counsel on any subject. He truly was the most wonderful counselor ever sent from heaven, speaking perfect words on every subject.
But note that His name is also "The mighty God." That He is God’s Son in no wise marks Him as of secondary importance in the Godhead. Before His incarnation, He was "equal with God" (Philippians 2:6). Even after He allowed Himself to be slain, He conquered death itself, and then could proclaim that "all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth" (Matthew 28:18).
His name is also to be called "The everlasting Father"—or, as many authorities would translate it, "Father of eternity." He is the Creator of time, as well as space and matter. "By him were all things created," and "without him was not any thing made that was made" (Colossians 1:16; John 1:3). He also could say, even though He was the Son of the Father, that "I and my Father are one" (John 10:30).
Yet another component of the name by which He is to be called is "The Prince of Peace." Though He is God, He is also man, and thus can be the one and only true and successful "mediator between God and men" (1 Timothy 2:5). He alone can bring true peace to the world, for "God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself" (2 Corinthians 5:19). He is the great Peacemaker (Matthew 5:9), who " . . . made peace through the blood of his cross" (Colossians 1:20).
What a glorious, multi-dimensional name He has! —and yet even this is not all. Speaking of this same God/man, the prophet Jeremiah said: "This is his name whereby he shall be called, THE LORD OUR RIGHTOUSNESS" (Jeremiah 23:6). The Lord Jesus "is made unto us wisdom and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption" (1 Corinthians 1:30). The heavenly Father "hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him" (2 Corinthians 5:21).
Thou Shalt Call His Name Jesus
When the time finally approached for the ancient prophecies to be fulfilled, God sent the angel Gabriel to a humble carpenter, who was engaged to marry a godly Jewish maiden named Mary, both of them descendants of King David, who had lived a thousand years earlier. The angel told Joseph that Mary, though pregnant, was still a chaste virgin, and was about to become the instrument to fulfill Isaiah’s great prophecy. "And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins" (Matthew 1:21).
Even before this, Gabriel had been sent to Mary with a similar announcement. "And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS" (Luke 1:31). Then he also made the amazing statement: " . . . that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God" (Luke 1:35).
The name "Jesus" seems a much simpler name than the exalted names predicted by Isaiah and Jeremiah. Other Jews had already been known by that name—Joshua, Isaiah, Hosea, Jeshua, are all variants of the same name. But it is wonderfully appropriate—in effect embracing all the other names, for it means, simply, "Jehovah saves," or "Jehovah our Savior."
Jesus is, therefore, His human name, given to Him by His heavenly Father and embracing His entire ministry of bringing salvation to a lost world and to men and women lost in sin but longing for forgiveness, peace and everlasting life.
Still there is more. The first reference to His name in the New Testament is in its very first chapter. "And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ" (Matthew 1:16). Not only is His name to be called Jesus: He is also called Christ.
That is, He is "the Christ," the long-awaited "Messiah" of Israel. These names are actually titles, of course, both meaning "the anointed One," in Greek and Hebrew respectively. In His human incarnation, He has been anointed by the Father as His eternal Prophet, Priest, and King. As our eternal Prophet, He is the incarnate Word of God (John 1:1, 14), forever declaring to us the Father and His will (John 1:18). As our great High Priest, "he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them" (Hebrews 7:25). Finally, there will be "on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS" (Revelation 19:16), when He returns as our eternal King, "and he shall reign for ever and ever" (Revelation 11:15).
His human name is thus Jesus Christ, but there is still another name—a first name, as it were—that should be added by those who "believe on his name," and thus "become the sons of God" (John 1:12). "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved" (Romans 10:13). He is, to us, Lord, as well as Jesus the Christ. Following His resurrection, the apostle Peter said to the Jews: "God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ" (Acts 2:36).
To the believer, therefore, His full name, so to speak, is "Lord Jesus Christ." But He may well be called by these other wonderful names as well, even now as we try to serve and honor Him in this present world.
His Name Is Called the Word of God
Yet there are still more names with which we shall honor Him when He comes again. One day our Lord Jesus Christ will return in power and great glory to this world He created and for which He has paid the redemption price in His own shed blood. The apostle John was granted the prophetic vision of His triumphant coming, and he saw and heard yet three more wonderful names by which He is to be called in the ages to come. "And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True" (Revelation 19:11). He is, even now, our "faithful high priest" (Hebrews 2:17), "a faithful Creator" (1 Peter 4:19), and "the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God" (Revelation 3:14). One of His great names in eternity will be Faithful and True, and the final chapter in the Bible includes these words: "These sayings are faithful and true" (Revelation 22:6), because it is the One who is ever Faithful and True who speaks them.
And then we read that "his name is called The Word of God" (Revelation 19:13). He was the creating Word in the beginning (John 1:1-3), the living Word in His incarnation (John 1:14), and now the victorious Word in the grand consummation when He rides victoriously over His enemies in triumph back to the earth.
Then there is the final name that He is to be called, "KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS" (Revelation 19:16). In that great day, all the universe will know that God has "given him a name which is above every name: That at the name of Jesus [that is, 'the name belonging to Jesus'] every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father" (Philippians 2:9-11).
There is your answer, Agur. "His Son’s name" is so indescribably great that it almost exhausts the language to tell it all. His name is called "Wonderful" and all the other beautiful names we see in His Word, and no doubt we shall learn many more in eternity.
But for now we especially love His human name given to us as those He has redeemed. He is our Lord Jesus Christ and, whether anyone can understand the significance of all His other names or not, it is enough simply to "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved" (Acts 16:31).
It is fitting that the Book of God closes in speaking this beautiful name of the Son of the heavenly Father: "He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly. Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen" (Revelation 22:20-21).

It has been revealed to Lawyers Weekly that as a result of this alleged behaviour, Asimus was subsequently hospitalised and diagnosed with severe depression and work-induced post-traumatic stress disorder.
Asimus declined to comment when contacted by Lawyers Weekly and referred our enquiries to Maurice Blackburn, the law firm acting for her.
Employment and industrial law principal Giri Sivaraman is representing Asimus.
Maurice Blackburn confirmed that a mediation hearing involving Asimus, Leaver and Hicksons has been scheduled for the Human Rights Commission on Friday (28 February).
Lander & Rogers is acting for Hicksons Lawyers.
Sydney-based workplace relations partner Mark Sullivan is leading the Landers legal team.
According to her LinkedIn profile, Asimus joined Hicksons in September 2011.
Prior to that, her experience included a five-year stint at Ashurst, which included an eight-month secondment to the Aboriginal Legal Service.
Hicksons has offices in Sydney, Newcastle, Canberra, Melbourne and Brisbane.
Intimidation and verbal outbursts
Lawyers Weekly understands that Asimus’ claim details a litany of alleged grievances against Leaver, the firm and its human resources department.
Lawyers Weekly has been told the alleged affection of Leaver towards Asimus was noticed by others at the firm.
In addition to the alleged sexual harassment, Lawyers Weekly understands Asimus was also allegedly on the receiving end of aggressive verbal outbursts by Leaver that left her feeling intimidated, shocked and fearful.
It is also Lawyers Weekly’s understanding that Leaver was not disciplined by the firm for his alleged conduct.
Lawyers Weekly has been informed that Asimus was a successful lawyer at Hicksons, having been promoted to associate level as reported in Lawyers Weekly on 19 August 2013.
Despite her comparatively good performance, it is Lawyers Weekly’s understanding that she received very little administrative or secretarial support and that she was regularly working in excess of 100 hours per week, including weekends.
“We take this issue very seriously, and take the responsibility of not disclosing the confidential information of our staff very seriously,” said senior Hicksons partner Rod Cameron.
Cameron, who heads the firm’s mortgage and debt recovery practice, would not comment on the specific nature of Asimus’ allegations.
Lawyers Weekly contacted Hicksons managing partner John Markos and Cameron Leaver for comment.
Both Markos and Leaver did not respond to Lawyers Weekly, with Cameron speaking on behalf of the firm.
Asimus is still listed as an employee on the Hicksons website. Lawyers Weekly understands that she is still employed by the firm but has been on leave for several months.
A recent study by the Law Council of Australia (LCA) showed that half of women lawyers and one in three men reported they had been bullied or intimidated in the workplace.

The best way to save money is to not spend it. One way to build up your savings is to be frugile and thrifty when it comes to shopping. I'm not talking about making your own clothes or growing your own food or anything thing like that, I'm talking about having some common sense. Tip of the day common sense translates to dollars and cents. The best way to shop is out of season. Don't buy shorts in the summer or coats in the winter. It's the simple law of supply and demand at work. You'll pay top dollar for something when it is in high demand versus when the demand is low. No one is looking to buy clothes out of season except for the smart shopper. find things on clearance for 50-75% full price. Take the money you save on clothes and put it in a nice CD or money market account to grow your money. You work hard for your money, now it's time for your money to work hard for you. >>>Stay tuned next week for making it big in real estate.

That’s not to make light of the events–which have sparked massive debates and outrage. Rather, I put on my writer’s glasses and tried to evaluate the news reports AS A WRITER.
Conflict on Every Page: What Kind of Conflict?
Many writing teachers drum it into their students heads: conflict on every page.
What they mean is that something has to happen on every page that makes the situation worse for the characters. Storytelling is about the problems of life, not the happy moments. Happiness is only possible when thrown into relief by contrast with the bad stuff.
This can easily go wrong: after a writing class where conflict was encouraged, one writer added “conflict” by having a wild creature attack a main character; but in the next scene, the character easily escapes and nothing was different. That’s adding in conflict just for the sake of conflict and that’s off-target. Instead, conflict should be integral to the story and make the characters’ lives different in some way.
Recently, I found insight into this from a surprising source. In his book, Contagious: Why Things Catch On, Jonah Berger says that things go viral easier when people are met with moments of high arousal. That sounded suspiciously like “conflict on every page.” Berger backs up his claims with various psychological studies (you should read his book for details). The high arousal moments included positive emotions: excitement, awe, inspirations, humor. But they also included negative emotions: anger, disgust, anxiety, and especially outrage.
In his book, Berger gives examples of Outrage, including one about mothers who carry babies in a special sling. In 2008, the practice was celebrated with the inaugural International Babywearing Week. McNeil Consumer Healthcare, the company who makes Motrin pain medication wanted to support the event. According to Berger, they figured that carrying babies in a sling was great for the mother-child relationship; however, they also thought that it would cause strain on mother’s backs and they would need pain-relief. The advertisement they created, however, caused outrage!
The advertisement implied that mothers wore babies as “a fashion statement,” and it implied that babywearing looked “crazy.”
Outrage swept through the mommy-bloggers. And of course, OUTRAGE brings us back to Ferguson and the problems of racial relations in the U.S. Outrage–as a storytelling element–has been evident in almost every report I saw on the incident.
It’s not redundant to say this: the events in Ferguson were outrageous; the outrage at the events made the news stories successful. So successful that I later heard a radio interview with protestors in Hong Kong who were asked about relations with the police there in Hong Kong. The protestor answered that the relations were just as strained as those between police and citizens in Ferguson. In other words, the outrage–the negative emotional response to events–has been so strong that it has been reported worldwide and has become a symbol of difficult police reactions. That’s the power of outrage in storytelling.
In your story, can you find a place to add outrage? If you can, your story will be stronger.

1. When Andy advises me to let my thoughts come and go they come but don't go easily,
2. Later he advises me almost to ignore these thoughts by bringing my focus back to the breaths
Should I focus more on letting thoughts in or pushing them out?
Isn't it strange that (as he mentions on another day) that once I stop counting breaths and let the mind do what it wants to do there is much less thinking going on!"
Andy's Answer
1) Yes, thoughts will generally appear to arise without effort, but because we are not used to letting them go, instead choosing to mull them over, engage with them, or even fight with them, it can often feel as though it requires more effort to let go. In time and with practice it becomes clear that it requires less effort rather than more and that thoughts disappear quite happily if left alone.
2) I would never recommend 'ignoring' thoughts. The idea of meditation is to become more aware, more awake, more conscious - the very antitheses of 'ignore'-ance. I certainly recommend you don't get too caught up in the thoughts that arise and gently bring awareness back to the breath, but this is very different to ignoring the thoughts. It is like seeing the thought, acknowledging it, letting it go and then returning the focus to the breath. This is the way to practise.
3) And yes, it is always a surprise when we give the mind freedom to behave as it wants to, only for it to sit still and do nothing! But this is why it is in there, to help remind us that we do not need to control more, but rather less. Peace of mind is not found in rigidly forcing the mind in one direction, but rather training the mind to rest in awareness, be that with or without an object of focus. In the meantime, enjoy that place of quiet and in time it will become a more frequent characteristic of the first part of the exercise too.State Power vs Money Power
Posted by Orrin Woodward on February 15, 2016
In today’s capitalistic society, money is power. The more money a person has, the more choices and resources available. Initially, money was simply the most marketable commodity within society. If Tom raised chickens and had extra eggs, he sought to barter the eggs for another item he desired. Mary, for instance, may have wanted to purchase eggs, but Tom did’t need the woman’s bracelet she offered in return. Barter of commodities, then, required both parties to want the others person’s items and in a quantity that made the trade possible. This, however, was not normally the case which made the exchange of goods a laborious process of seeking someone who desired the item you offered in exchange and vice-versa.
Fortunately, some entrepreneur in ancient Lydia solved the barter dilemma by coining electrum (a natural occurring mixture of gold and silver) that was desired by nearly everyone. This changed the bartering process forever. Now, even through Tom didn’t want Mary’s bracelet, she could still get eggs for breakfast. How? Mary simply exchanged her bracelet to a willing third party for the electrum coins that she knew Tom would happily accept in exchange for his eggs. The electrum coins of Lydia, without exaggeration, launched classical civilization into its golden age. Thereafter, trade expanded across the classical world as the coins made the exchange process so much simpler. All exchanges, interestingly enough, are still a form of bartering with the specific commodity now being traded for an agreed upon quantity of coins (money is simply the most marketable commodity). All the other commodities in society were subsequently valued by the free market in the quantity of coins needed to purchase them.
Although free market entrepreneurs developed coins (commodity money) and exploded societal wealth, its important to remember that the ruling elites are not interested in societal wealth, Rather, they are interested in increasing their wealth and power. Accordingly, commodity money was viewed as a threat to the elites’ power structure because society’s members could now exchange goods freely and increase wealth with minimal State involvement. This was unacceptable. The elites, predictably, used the State’s monopoly of force to capture the money supply within society to increase their power and control. After all, power is maximized when the monopolization of force and money is maximized. Classical historian Augustus Boeckh recognized this.” Not surprisingly, the ruling elites (kings, aristocracy, and bankers) quickly seized control of the money supply and use this explosive new innovation to enhance its own power.
This theme, strikingly, seem to repeat over and over in recorded history, namely, elites dictates over what society creates. In this case, the elites dictated the money supply that society’s entrepreneurs created. Curiously, the story of money isn’t as simple as the elites defeating the masses of society for increased power. The truth is actually more complicated. For the elites divided into two groups and battled over the next millennia for control of the money supply. In one corner stood the public State Power. It sought to use its “monopoly of force” power to control the money supply and dictate the value of money. In the other corner, however, stood the private Money Power. It sought to use “fractional-reserve-banking” (FRB) to control the money supply and bribe the State to use its monopoly of force to ensure it’s “lawful” control. Society’s masses, regrettably, were in a “heads you win and tails I lose” economic quandary.
The historical record reveals the private Money Power defeated the public State Power game/set/match. As a result, money across the civilized world is now in the hands of private central banks that back the Big Banks practicing fractional-reserve-banking to manipulate each nations money supply for its gain and society’s loss. The author has termed the private Money Power’s control over the banking system and money supply the Financial Matrix – a system of control where the Money Power creates money out of thin air to loan to society’s members for profits and control. The money elites generate massive profits by loaning out fake money and then collecting interest and principle payments on the loans. The State, corporations, and people are all trapped in the Financial Matrix and are enslaved just like the Bible describes in Proverbs 22:7, “The borrower is slave to the lender.” The final fruit of the Financial Matrix equation is pain. For once the borrower has indebted himself, he experiences the pain and stress of paying off the debt with compound interest working against him. The control and profits, in a nutshell, go to the Money Power while the pain and stress of go to the debtors as they unknowingly sell themselves into slavery.
Perhaps an example of the process will help. Suppose a person desires to purchase a house for $100,000 and has 20% ($20,000) for a down payment. The bank does not have to use its existing deposits, but rather merely creates a mortgage loan for the $80,000 (not including other closing cost) to be paid back monthly with interest. If they person pays monthly for the next 30 years at a 6% interest rate, he will end up paying nearly twice as much for the house as what it is actually worth. The bank, in other words, is allowed to create the loan out of thin air but the borrower must pay back nearly twice as much in dollars earned by sweat-equity real production. To add insult to injury, if at anytime the borrower does not pay, the bank uses the State Power to foreclose on the loan and receive the property in collateral. Although the bank created the mortgage from nothing, it receives something in return – either the monthly payment or the property. Either way the bank receives something for nothing because of its State protected special arrangement.
I suggest the reader do something about his/her debt. That something is to get serious about escaping the Financial Matrix through utilizing the techniques taught within LIFE Leadership‘s Financial Fitness Program and my Financial Matrix book. Imagine what a debt-free lifestyle would do to alleviate pain and stress in one’s life and how awesome it would be to pass these principles onto the next generation. The future belongs to those who boldly go in the direction of their dreams!

Justin said
Awesome read Orrin! With banking seeming to be the easiest way to “create” profits, what state protections prevent the average citizen from starting their own bank and manipulating the system for their own gains?
Orrin Woodward said
Justin, that is a great question and, of course, the banking regulations require massive dollars to break into so the elites keep the people from joining the FLD party. 🙂 Only the Big Banks get to work directly with the Central Bank and purchase USA debt for massive, practically guaranteed gains. Anytime FLD exist, you can be rest assured that someone is blocking either the entrance or the exit to illicitly gain. 🙂 thanks, Orrin
Morgan Brooks said
I remember hearing you say that the Fractional Reserve Banking System is something we are going to put a stop to. Do we really only need a group of entreprenuers to make it in business for themselves to make that kind of shift?
Orrin Woodward said
What we need is education at all levels for once people understand how FRB benefits the few at the many’s expense and initiates the boom/bust cycles that have plagued Western Civilization then it cannot last. The truth sets people and society’s free. 🙂 LIFE Leadership plays its part along with other concerned citizens of the world no matter what field they are involved in. thanks, Orrin

Thank you Orrin for this amazing article, every time I read one of your blogs I understand finances just a little bit more. I really appreciate the fact that you have dedicated your life to educating all of us who truly want to learn about what matters in our lives. I would love to see an article that talks about how the dollar and America’s economics affect the rest of the worlds currencies, this is something I still do not fully understand. Thank you again Orrin!

Great blog Orrin!! “Heads you win, tails I lose” sums it all up. We need a third side to the coin. I believe Life Leadership is working on that.Most businesses now have an online presence whether they like it or not. Searching for your business name will bring up a myriad of directory sites all listing your credentials.
If you want to truly harness the power of Internet marketing you need to be proactive in keeping information accurate.
Think you don't need to worry about Internet advertising? Think again!
Almost all searches done on the Internet are to pre-qualify a business before calling them.
Customers are already reviewing your business online, you can either ignore them or take control and use social marketing to your advantage.
Practical Ways to Improve your Online Presence
Search for your company name and see which directories you appear in.
If the directory offers a free listing and looks like a reputable website, claim your listing and update your information. When a customer leaves a review you will now be informed and can act quickly if the review is not favourable.

Abstract As the capital of China, Beijing has experienced a continued and rapid urbanization process in the past few decades. One of the key environmental impacts of rapid urbanization is the effect of urban heat island UHI. The objective of this study was to estimate the urbanization indexes of Beijing from 1992 to 2013 based on the stable nighttime light NTL data derived from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program’s Operational Line Scanner System DMSP-OLS, which has became a widely used remote sensing database after decades of development. The annual average value nighttime light Digital Number NTL-DN, and the total lit number and urban area proportion within Beijing’s boundary were calculated and compared with social-economic statistics parameters to estimate the correlation between them. Four Landsat thematic mapper TM images acquired in 1995 and 2009 were applied to estimate the normalized difference vegetation index NDVI and normalized land surface temperature LSTnor, and spatial correlation analysis was then carried out to investigate the relationship between the urbanization level and NDVI and LSTnor. Our results showed a strong negative linear relationship between the NTL-DN value and NDVI; however, in contrast, a strong positive linear relationship between existed between the NTL-DN value and LSTnor. By conducting a spatial comparison analysis of 1995 and 2009, the vegetation coverage change and surface temperature difference were calculated and compared with the NTL-DN difference. Our result revealed that the regions of fast urbanization resulted in a decrease of NDVI and increase of LSTnor. In addition, choropleth maps showing the spatial pattern of urban heat island zones were produced based on different temperatures, and the analysis result indicated that the spatial distribution of surface temperature was closely related with the NTL-DN and NDVI. These findings are helpful for understanding the urbanization process as well as urban ecology, which both have significant implications for urban planning and minimize the potential environmental impacts of urbanization in Beijing.

Until now, new immigrant nurses have had to prove they can converse with patients in basic Hebrew, but physicians -- who have less direct contacts with the sick were exempted. Now the Knesset Labor, Social Affairs and Health Committee on Monday approved regulations that would require doctors and two other types of professionals in healthcare to show their Hebrew proficiency as well.In addition to immigrant doctors, clinical communications specialists and clinical criminologists who ask for a license in their fields will have to prove to the Health Ministry that they have a basic knowledge of Hebrew. The proof will be by taking a state exam in Hebrew, having received an academic degree in a Hebrew-speaking college or university, having successfully taken matriculation exams in Hebrew, successfully passing exams in a relevant Hebrew ulpan or passing a Hebrew-screening test as part of psychometric exams given in other languages.Committee chairman Likud MK Haim Katz said that while aliya is very welcome and that he was aware of the language difficulties faced by new immigrants, especially in the health professions, the good of the patient was even more important. Yesh Atid MK Shimon Solomon, who said he almost lost his son because of medical treatment in which the professional had difficulty understanding Hebrew, said that even physicians must communicate with patients so their treatment could better succeed.Representatives of the Absorption Ministry and immigrant associations opposed the new regulations, arguing that new immigrants will have difficulty getting acclimated to the country and making a living if they cannot work without first learning Hebrew. Lawyer Avital Weiner of the Health Ministry’s legal department said the required level of Hebrew was very basic and a "minimum for conversing with a patient."

If you were looking for grips or an AC and I sent you a resume would you be more interested in:
1) a list of numerous projects Ive worked on UNDER the respective title
- So I'd just list project names I've worked on, the more specific role I did, and the year
- example:
Grip & Electric:
- Key Grip, "Project Name" Year
My concern about this way is even if I have a good handful of projects I've worked on and the roles I've done, someone I'm sending it to might look at this and say "so what? I haven't even heard of that project?" and that it's not substantial enough
or
2) a list of the responsibilities and experience of equipment and such I HAVE under that respective title instead?
-example:
Assistant Camera:
- "Title"
- 1st AC- responsibilities; equipment worked on
Which of these would be better to go with? I originally went with the first one and then had a separate section down below listing the equipment I've worked with.
Also my other question is, If I don't have a substantial list of either category "Assistant Camera" or "Grip" but have a lot of experience, should I still put them on separate resumes even though they'd be shorter (for now)? I've always been told not to put Assistant Camera and Grip on same resume
Thoughts?

Option 1 is what I do. I generally only include credits in the department of the job I'm applying for (ie, that low budget commercial where I jumped on as a non union 2AC because I had a slow week, or my first on set job as a locations PA) doesn't belong on my resume for set lighting jobs.
I would suggest that short films (at least those that haven't won major awards) or videography gigs should fall off the resume as soon as you have 8-12 professional/industry credits.
If you have some niche skill (like scuba training, rock climbing, extensive experience with high speed cameras, infrared photography), I'd list it in it's own category ("Other Skills"). If you have a few professional credits under your belt, it must be taken for granted that you're experienced with the most common equipment encountered in that role.
Hopefully, once you get the ball rolling, you'll get most of your work through recommendations, and the resume will become less important, but always good to keep it up to date.
Posted 18 May 2017 - 12:06 AM
Thank you for responding with feedback Matthew, I really appreciate it!
I will keep that in mind about the professional credits. I do have more than a couple indie-features under my belt but what would constitute as professional and fall under non-union gigs?
Another main question I have is, if I do version 1, I feel that even though I'm listing credits with the same role over and over, with the project names, the people reading it are going to be like "so what? I haven't even heard of that project?" Thoughts?
As an update, most of my work comes by recommendation or referral nowadays but I understand your point about the resume being less important overtime and up to date.
Thank you again!

Look up some comparable films to the ones you've worked on. Films of equal budget that maybe were distributed by the same company. Or follow the producers of the film and see what else they've done. Then look at the crew names, google those names, find the websites or online profiles and download their resumes to see what format and information they're including.
The NY Production Guide has a list as well of professional crew you could try googling. Not everyone will have a website where you can download their resume but some may. But to narrow the search to relevant results, try the steps prior to that.

Will do Michael!

By professional, I just meant paid work. Or even "freebies" of good quality that achieved some visibility. You just don't want to try to pad your resume with student films or wedding video or something.
I don't distinguish between union and non union work on my resume. If you're an IATSE member, go to meetings and network that way, and pay attention to your local's rules with regards to accepting non union work.
Posted 26 May 2017 - 02:47 PM
Mario,
In full agreement with pretty much everything Matthew said...just include your position, the project name and the year, but at a certain point you won't really need it. At this point I get most of my work through referrals or through the union, the only time I'm ever asked to submit a resume is if I'm gaffing an indie feature for an out of town DP i've never worked with before, and even then i just sent an email with a list of credits I've done...I haven't done a proper resume in years, and in this line of work it really is just a list of projects you've done and position, because no matter where you go in the country your job is pretty much the same and any potentially hiring producer is going to know exactly what you did on a job if you put down "grip" or "gaffer" or whatever...they know what your job is, usually when they're asking for a resume they just want to gauge your experience at it to determine if you're the right fit for the production.

Introduction Excerpt
Type I Chiari malformation (CMI) is a neurological disorder of the hindbrain in which the position of cerebellum is lower in the brain which could serve as an obstruction to cerebrospinal fluid motion. CMI patients present a wide range of symptoms that can vary from pain in the head and neck, dizziness or impaired cognitive functions. It is radiologically identified by the position of the cerebellar tonsils to be three to five millimeters below the foramen magnum. The goal of the present study is to determine what cerebellum morphometric parameters beyond the tonsillar herniation are different for CMI patients as compared to healthy controls..

Andrew Fountain — May 10th, 2011
Many people are discouraged by Hebrews
Why do you think that is?
Full of O.T. characters like Melchizedek who you have hardly heard of
Complex language
discouraging warnings
all kinds of stuff about the temple and sacrificial system
But
Contains many of our most encouraging and helpful texts of Scripture (as we will see)
Has the best presentation anywhere of the New Covenant
Teaches us some things about Jesus that are not taught with the same clarity anywhere else
The core message packs a very powerful punch
Introduction to Hebrews
Many people are discouraged by Hebrews
“Paul’s Epistle to the Hebrews”
?
That title was given 100’s of years after it was written
As we shall see, it’s
not written by Paul
, it’s
not an Epistle
and it’s
not to the Hebrews
!
Authorship
Ultimately unknown
not stated in letter
early on in History, some stated it was Paul
—probably because they believed an apostle had to have written it for it to be in Scripture
(but Mark, Luke...)
Cannot be Paul or Scripture would contradict itself
[Heb 2:3]
compared with
[Gal 1:11-12]
The big question is
Why
it is anonymous
author would have got into trouble were it known
(unlikely—not afraid of persecution
[12:4]
)
Christians sometimes write books anonymously because they don’t want the glory for themselves
So what
do
we know about the author?
Amazingly talented writer (written at the level of the most polished Greek literature)
Hangs out with Paul’s group (Timothy:
[Heb 13:22,23]
)
Some ideas are very similar to Paul’s but there are some new insights
Knows the O.T. Scriptures very well
Suggestions of people we know were Paul’s friends
Barnabas
Silas
Apollos
Mark
Luke
Can’t be Timothy!
Can’t be one of the 12
Reasons for suggesting Apollos:
[Acts 18:24]
[“Now a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man and mighty in the Scriptures, came to Ephesus.”]
he was noted for his eloquence and this book is very eloquent!
he was from Alexandria—the home of this style of polished Greek
he was “mighty in the Scriptures” i.e. the Old Testament
[Acts 18:28]
[“he vigorously refuted the Jews publicly, showing from the Scriptures that Jesus is the Christ.”]
[1 Cor 1:12]
—there seems to be an Apollos fan club
[1 Cor 3:4-6]
—this is a problem in the church
So this gives a motive for making it anonymous
But Paul put his name to his letters, why not Apollos?
you have to with a letter, but this was not a letter (as we shall see)
It is a work of art, a piece of literature, a demonstration of extraordinary literary skill
We can’t be sure, but Apollos is as good a guess as anyone
Date
It must have been before 70AD when the temple was destroyed or he could hardly have failed to mention that!
We cannot be more precise
Place
13:24 is totally ambiguous—those originally “from” Italy, living elsewhere, or the greeting could be “from Italy”.
Recipients
Must be Greek-speaking because of the complexity of the language (High-Greek)
The term “Hebrews” was reserved for Jews still living in Palestine, who wouldn’t have Greek as a first language
Some suggest it could be Jewish converts who were tempted to return to Judaism
But there is actually no reason to restrict it to Jews
So it could have been to any church in Greek speaking world (most of the Roman Empire)
But there is actually no reason to restrict it to Jews
The Gentiles were just as likely to be interested in the Scriptures
They were even more likely to want to know how the O.T. related to
themselves
This is one of the main purposes of the book
Form
Not an Epistle (letter)
Most people suggest it was a sermon that was later written down
My theory...
No opening section (from / to / grace / prayer of thanksgiving)
3 verses on the end show that it was written to be sent
Paul’s epistles are full of “I write to you...”
Whereas this is full of expressions such as
[11:32 “what more shall I say? For time will fail me...”]
Frequent references to running out of time
[5:11 “say... hearing”]
Most people suggest it was a sermon that was later written down
two problems
very long for a sermon
very complex
many of the intricate literary features would be lost in a sermon
My theory
(this is just an example of what might have happened!)
The church in Corinth wanted to run a conference, so they contacted Apollos, who was in Rome at the time.
They had been really blessed by his understanding of how the O.T. related to us today.
They asked him to give three messages on this theme at the conference.
It was a great success and lots of people wanted the tapes or the DVD...
So they asked Apollos if he would write the messages out for them.
He agreed on condition it was anonymous, because of all the trouble with factions at Corinth.
When he did so, he did quite a bit of work polishing it and organizing the content.
He then sent them a copy with a note attached to the end (
[13:22-24]
).
We will look at the structure shortly
Some Christians react to the idea that something can be Scripture and art at the same time
Some of the Psalms are intricate Hebrew poetry
Other books as well, such as Song of Solomon
unfortunately I can’t show you the beauty of the Greek, since you would have to be fairly advanced Greek students to really appreciate it.
My Greek tutor once made me translate some of it...
Structure
What is our primary purpose in reading this book?
Not just to get some “precious thoughts”
our first responsibility is to understand it
then we listen to what God is saying to us through it
involve mind, spirit, emotions, will
then we respond to it
involve mind, spirit, emotions, will
we wouldn’t be allowed to go to the middle of John Arnott’s sermon & take a few words out of context
we are going to look at the whole structure of the book
this is not intellectualism, it is faithfulness and submissiveness
If God has chosen to play the music in a certain style, we have to attune ourselves to it
History of attempts to find a structure
Tradition view divides it into teaching
[start-10:18]
and application
[10:19-end]
Only reason is that this is how Paul’s epistles are usually structured
It is generally recognized that this fits very badly
A second view is the “Patchwork”
In effect gives up on any structure
In the last 100 years, there has been a lot of success in identifying literary features in the book which help us determine the structure.
many of my ideas come from papers by scholars: Albert Vanhoye, David Alan Black, David J. MacLeod & Amar Djaballah
Structure
Three sermons
At the conclusion of most of the parts, he
announces
the next section
“Inclusio”
Overall structure
handout of structure
My suggestion is that originally there were three messages, of three points each
Each one could stand alone as a sermon
At the start of the 2nd and 3rd, he summarizes the previous one and outlines what is to come
This is a good practice when you are speaking
There is also a warning application in between each message and a longer application at the end
The writer (who is also the speaker (
[13:22]
) has shaped the material very cleverly and in almost perfect symmetry
shown in handout
At the conclusion of most of the parts, he
announces
the next section
This is a good practice when you are speaking
shown in handout
“Inclusio”
This is the term scholars use for words or phrases that are like matching bookends and the start and end of a passage
They “include” the passage
They are helpful in marking out the sections
shown in handout
repeated similar theme words —
Example of alliteration
Today preachers often have alliteration
or similarly sounding themes:
Thrilled, Filled & Spilled
Hebrews uses collections of synonyms—words of the same family
e.g. merciful, compassionate, helper, sympathizes
shown in handout—3a
Updated on 2011-05-11 by Andrew FountainGetting started with a blog for your business is a worthwhile use of your time and effort. Choosing a blogging platform is the first step in getting started. I highly recommend that you go with a ‘hosted’ site, rather than one that is on a free platform. The one used by the majority of people working online is WordPress.org.
The hosted option eliminates the hassle of finding a host for your blog as the company takes care of that for you. This option would cost you a monthly or annual fee. I’ve used both Blue Host and Host Gator to host my WordPress sites, but have now switched over to Liquid Web for all of my blog hosting because of recent changes in service and performance with those larger companies.
What you want to completely avoid is a free blogging platform, such as WordPress.com, Tumblr.com, or Blogger.com. I compare this to setting up a lemonade stand on the corner as opposed to leasing a space in the mall. You’re setting up a blog for your business, not for a hobby that may go by the wayside in the future.
WordPress.org is the other blog platform you should know, which is a standalone option. If you are already hosting some of your websites with a web host, WordPress.org is ideal for you. Not only is WordPress.org free for unlimited use, but it is the best-supported blog platform there is. For ultimate control of your blog, this is as good as it gets. It is the blog platform of choice of today’s savviest bloggers.
Visit the sites I’ve mentioned above and if you’re going for the hosted option, simply sign-up for an account and you’ll be ready to start blogging immediately. It’s truly a simple process to set up WordPress through your hosting account, and they will be happy to help you to do it quickly and easily.
Choosing a Name for Your Blog
If you already own a website, you understand the significance of choosing a good domain name. A good domain name not only enhances the branding of your business and makes it easy for your readers to share with others.
If your blog is going to play a significant role in your business, then spend some time choosing the right domain name for it. People tend to remember memorable domain names that end with a dot com to spread it around easier. I recommend using GoDaddy as the registrar for all of your domains. I currently own almost six hundred domains and appreciate how they are handled through this company.
Choosing a Template / Theme for Your Blog
With the free platforms like Blogger.com and WordPress.com, the need to hire a Web designer is eliminated. These options already have blog templates (often called “themes”) ready for use. Just pick a design that works well with the theme of your business and get ready to start blogging. The downside to this is that there is only so much you can do to alter its look and feel. What you see is what you get.
With WordPress.org however, you’re free to hire a Web Designer to design the style of your blog from the ground up. There are no limitations to what you can do with your design. There are WordPress.org templates that are also freely given away by the WordPress community with no strings attached. You have full rights to grab any of these templates and alter them to suit the theme of your business blog. If you need a recommendation for someone to help you set up a WordPress blog that’s exactly what you are thinking of, contact me and I’ll give you some names of the people that have helped me with my sites.
You can search on Google “Wordpress themes” and you’ll get a variety of sites to choose from. One of the more popular ones is found at.
Hi Connie, I’m going to switch to liquidweb real soon. Hostgator can no longer support my VPS to the quality of support I need.
I just started blogging for my business. I like to think I know a fair bit about WordPress though as I’ve had sites before and I have even designed themes…
There has been debate over free themes. I think if you a) get them from the WordPress.org site or b) from a recommendation of an authority; you are safe. If you just Google on, there is a chance there might be a nasty script hidden inside lol.
Mark Hunter recently posted…Do 5-Star Ratings Make Good Plugins
I couldn’t agree more Connie!
WordPress.org is definitely the way to go,
with regards to using a professional, self hosted blogging platform.
And like you pointed out, if need be, you can always hire a professional web designer, if you want or need a premium theme customized.Thanks for sharing some extremely practical information.

Rusty is a loving, 8 year old cocker spaniel. He is looking to land himself into a home with no kids to live out his golden years. He gets along with some dogs, but not all.
For information on adopting Rusty, please contact the HOPE Program by CLICKING HERE or calling . You can complete an application online by clicking here.
3-23-16 Rusty has been paroled and returned to his rescue. He is still available for adoption!
3-16-16
"Rusty is doing very well this week with being patient and waiting for me to take him out. He's waiting in his crate & sitting until I tell him it's okay to come out. He also waits with the "place" command. Rusty seemed to be even more playful and energetic this past week. Overall, he's doing very well and has been well behaved. Rusty is so friendly and affectionate. Nobody can understand why he is still here."
3-9-16
"Rusty has been doing well with all of his known commands. We've been working on variations of "leave it" this week. Now you can place a treat on his paw and he'll wait for you to give the "take it" cue. We are still working on placing it on his nose. Rusty has also done well with variations of the "touch" cue. He's been about the same with his tolerance of the other dogs, but I still try to expose him to them whenever possible."
3-2-16
"Rusty did very well this week with our training. We worked on loose leash walking and I setup an obstacle course for him to go through. That seemed like the best way to get him active this week. For some reason, he wasn't very interested in play or fetch. He's being pretty tolerant of the other dogs. He follows commands from anyone he meets and is always friendly. Rusty hasn't been on a single home visit since he's been here. He's shown much improvement in his time here so I'm hoping we can work on finding him a permanent home. I enjoy his company very much and I know someone else would too. I'd hate to see him spend his life here when he could have a much better one in a real home."
2-24-16
"This week, in addition to our usual training of all his commands, I worked with Rusty and Jasmine together. We did parallel walking and desensitization. Both dogs followed commands together and Rusty did very well with not showing any signs of aggression towards Jasmine. Rusty had to meet 50 people this week in order to complete his homework and as usual he was very friendly with everyone he met. He followed commands well from everyone too."
2-17-16
"Rusty is doing very well with all of his training. Rusty has a new habit of scooping my hand up onto his back and it's pretty sweet. He's been very affectionate lately and hopefully, he can show that to potential adopters & maybe it will help him get a home. Rusty has been doing well with the other dogs with the exception of Katy. These 2 really don't seem to like each other, but we hope in time that it will get better. Overall, I think his tolerance for other dogs is getting better and he's being less reactive to them."
2-10-16
"Rusty gets a gold star this week for his willingness to learn new things and follow multiple commands in order before getting a reward. He still loves playing out in the snow. He likes to dig holes in the snow, but he will not dig holes in the yard which is good. I set up a small obstacle course for Rusty outside with milk crates & balls and he really does well with that in the yard."

"Rusty seems to be doing just a little better around the other dogs this week. With so many new dogs, there is a bit of a getting to know each other period. He is being less reactive to them as time goes on. Rusty is still doing very well with commands and working on new ones. Rusty will sit and wait while his food is in his bowl until I tell him it's okay to eat. His recall is also pretty good when he's off leash and I call him to come."
1-27-16
"I don't think anyone enjoyed the massive amounts of snow we got more than Rusty. He had so much fun digging, jumping, and even eating the snow. We really had a lot of fun playing in the snow this week, but he also did very well listening to me and following all of his commands."
1-20-16
"Rusty got a haircut this week. He looks so small now that he's shaved. Rusty has been working going up and down the stairs a lot. It's going very well. I swear he runs faster outside now that he had his haircut! Guess all that hair really weighed him down. He's still listening well to all of his commands. He's been very well behaved this past week."
1-13-16
"Rusty is more than ready to be adopted. He just needs some help finding a home. Rusty's only barrier to adoption is his general dislike of other dogs, but it is on a case by case basis. He's not a fan of Ayla because she's so bouncy and loves to play. He knows his commands very well and we're working on new ones."
1-06-16
"I'm noticing that Rusty is getting more comfortable with me as time goes on. He's starting to rest his head on me or scoop my hand up onto his head to be petted. It's cute and just helps form more of a bond with him. He seems to listen to my commands better each week too. The new dog, Ayla, is interested in playing with Rusty, but as you know, he doesn't exactly play well with most other dogs. He barked at her when she tried to engage in play with him. Hopefully, over time Rusty will be more tolerant of her. I think sometimes he confuses play with being attacked and gets scared."
12-30-15
"When off leash in the yard, Rusty responded well when given the "come" command this week. He does well when we give him the "place" command. He's content to lay down on his mat and sleep. He's okay with other dogs as long as they don't get in his face. His favorite dog buddy here is still Pepper."
12-23-15
"Rusty and I practiced his commands and worked on getting his back paws on the stairs to walk up backwards. Rusty hung out with Pepper and Wally. He doesn't mind either one of them and gets along well with both. Rusty likes to sleep a lot and would be a good dog for someone who isn't super active."
12-16-15
"Rusty and Wally spent some time walking and playing together this week. Rusty was really good and showed no aggression towards Wally. I also worked with getting Rusty to stand on the seat at our tables. He did it once with no problem but after trying again, he fell and seems scared to try anymore. Rusty is ready for a home."
12-09-15
"This week I did something a little different with Rusty. While out in the yard, I would jog backwards and coax Rusty to chase me for a short distance. Then, I'd stop suddenly and treat him when he auto sits. He did very well and caught on right away allowing us to do a sort of stop/go kind of game. I also started working with him trying the "touch" command but getting him to touch a ball when I point at it instead of my hand like usual. That one needs a little more work and practice."
12-02-15
"I took Rusty cell to cell to meet some new people and he loved it. He loves attention. Rusty will snap at another dog if the dog gets right in his face but otherwise he's okay. He's completely fine with Pepper though and doesn't seem to mind Wally. The weather hasn't been great this week so our outdoor time has been short so we've practiced loose leash walking inside."
11-25-15
"Rusty gets a gold star this week for practicing find it and puppy push ups. I put a treat under one of the two bowls I have and he found it. Rusty met the new dog, Chloe. They don't play together, but they sniffed each other and he was okay with that. He's getting better at not barking as much when I'm not in the cell. Rusty really has come a long way. He's such a good dog."
11-18-15
"This week Rusty played with Pepper and he's okay with Wally so they hang out near each other. We did lots of doggie push ups. We played hide and seek in the cell. We tried to get Delaney and Rusty closer together this week and they still aren't very fond of each other. We'll keep working on it."
11-12-15
"Rusty is doing well living with 2 people now versus 1 like he originally was. He barks less when left alone from what I've heard and noticed. I've been using the place command with him in the cell more often and he's doing really well with it."
11-04-15
"Rusty listens to all of his commands and enjoys balls that squeak the best. We spent some time close to Ivy this week while both dogs were leashed and it went pretty well. They were able to get close. Neither dog reacted negatively to one another. It is a start and I am proud of him."
10-28-15
"I put Rusty on a diet and he's doing good with that. He gets along with all the dogs here except Delaney but they're getting better. Rusty no longer barks at her when she barks at him. He is a really good dog who just needs a home with people who can pay attention to him a lot."
10-21-15
"Rusty practiced auto sit and stay which he does both well. We played catch and tug of war. Rusty goes in his crate in the cell whenever I tell him to. If he jumps on my bed and I tell him to get off, he does so with no problems. He is a really great dog."
10-14-15
"Pepper and Rusty had fun chasing each other in and out of the dog pool. Rusty even liked laying in the water. His favorite dog here is Pepper. Rusty gets along with most of the other dogs here. He doesn't like hyper dogs. Rusty listens very well and knows all basic commands."
10-07-15
"Rusty and I had fun going to the dog park with Pepper. They get along super well. I even tied their leashes together and let them run around with each other. I did this to keep them both moving. Pepper has so much energy and I wanted to wear him out. Plus, I wanted them to try to walk together. Rusty has learned to automatically sit when I stop walking and to put his front paws in the milk crate. I put Rusty on a diet this week. I was told he was getting fat."
09-30-15
"Rusty met Sweetpea this week and did well with her. We played catch and lots of tug of war. Rusty loves to play with his balls and teddy bear. He's a great dog who is very people friendly. Everyone here loves him."
09-23-15
"Rusty and I played catch together this week like always. I took Rusty and Pepper to the softball field together. They are great together. Rusty is pretty good with the other dogs unless they bark at him and then he will lunge forward. We practiced stay and some tricks on the milk crate. I even let Rusty go in the pool which he liked to do."
09-16-15
"This week, Rusty and Pepper had fun playing with one another. Rusty gets along with all of the dogs except Delaney. It's something we have been working on. Rusty likes to play catch and walk around the block while people pet him. He loves people and the attention they give him. He does not like it when other dogs bark. He likes to play with his teddy bear and other toys. Rusty is a great dog."
09-09-15
"This week me and Rusty got to play with the new dogs here. Rusty did very well with this. We practiced some tricks like stand, stay, and sit. He is doing very well with all of them. Rusty is a good dog."
09-02-15
"Rusty is doing very well. He played with his best friend here, Pepper. If I tell him to stay anywhere, he won't move and listens so well. He loves to cuddle and play catch. Rusty loves when people pet him and I haven't had any problems with him. I have no problems putting his eye and ear meds in."
08-26-15
"Each week, Rusty gets better and better. He really is a good dog who needs a good home. He will make someone very happy. If I wasn't in jail, I would take him home with me. This week, we hung out playing catch. He loves that and practicing commands like find it, sit, rollover, and leave it."
08-19-15
"Rusty is an amazing dog. He's very well behaved and listens well. I tell him to stay, lay down, or sit and he knows all of the commands. He likes to cuddle with you. Rusty is good with people and tolerates most of the other dogs pretty well. I love that he knows his name. We play catch and I take him in the doggie pool we have here. He likes to do both of those things."
08-12-15
"Rusty is such a joy to have. He is so lovable and loves to play. He is also very smart. I took him to the dog yard this week so he could run around and we played catch. He gets along with most of the dogs. Rusty and Pepper are friends. They like each other very much. I love Rusty and hope that he can get into a good home. He is going to make someone very happy."
08-05-15
"I just got Rusty and he is a really friendly dog. He met a lot of new people so far and he did well with all of them. I took him out to play and he likes to play catch. He does really well for an older dog. Rusty knows commands like sit, stay, down, and roll over. He is very smart and let's me put medicine in his eyes and ears. Rusty doesn't always let you take a toy from him, but we're going to work on it. I let him sleep in bed with me and he takes up a lot of the room on the bed. Oh, and he does fart. When he comes over to me and puts his head on my chest though, it makes it worth it!"07 Apr 2015
Upgraded access to the Jamestown saleyards is one of the first reforms to emerge from the recently completed A Modern Transport System for Agriculture: A New Partnership Approach project.
The upgraded access for B-double and road trains to the saleyards, identified as a key issue during the project, will avoid the need for these vehicles to pass through the centre of Jamestown either on their way further north or to the saleyards.
It has been identified that for an investment of under $100,000 on minor roadworks on the northern end of OD5 Road, access for B-doubles and road trains could be delivered to the saleyards from RM Williams Way.
There is also the opportunity, for a relatively small investment, to improve the southern end of OD5 Road and its junction with Cockburn Road. This would provide access for B-doubles wishing to access the saleyards from the east.
The project has identified a number of reform initiatives across the State, aimed at ensuring more efficient and less costly transport for primary producers. The other initiatives, which are currently being investigated include:
• Approval of access for BAB quads road train access to the 53.5-metre road train network between the Northern Territory border and Port Augusta.
• Extending the maximum permitted length of a road train prime mover when operating as a semitrailer from 19 to 20 metres.
• Amending the existing SA tri-axle dolly policy to be nationally consistent.
The project emerged from a need for a more collaborative approach to agricultural road transport.
Agribusiness generates about $19.4 billion in revenue annually and accounts for almost half of South Australia’s total merchandise exports.
An important part of the project was the online survey conducted in November and December last year which clearly identified areas of concern in the regions.
Ninety per cent of the issues raised were from regional and rural South Australia.
The regulatory reforms will reduce costs for operator, farmers and other businesses.
Work on some of the reform initiatives identified through this project is already well underway, including discussions with the National Heavy vehicle Regulator.
DPTI will be establishing a team dedicated to addressing these regulatory issues over the next 12 months.
Primary Producers SA Chairperson Rob Kerin said primary producers welcomed the opportunity to have their say on the topic of road transport.
“Progressing this feedback into actions has provided a great opportunity for industry and government to work together to create efficiencies and real solutions that will benefit not just the agriculture industry, but the entire State,” he said.
A Project Steering Group will be set up to oversee the scoping and implementation of the initiatives, with quarterly meetings to occur during the 2015-16 year.

A Modern Transport System for Agriculture: A New Partnership Approach
Photo: ABC, Annabelle Homer.As someone who hoards (enjoys, loves, and wears, too!) makeup, I must say it all started with eyeliner and mascara, so those are products I have a lot of, but as a contact lens wearer (and someone who struggles with allergies), I usually find it difficult to find an eyeliner that lasts a long time on my waterline. IT Cosmetics is a brand that is usually incorporated into my makeup almost every single time. And, so, I have another review to share with you today.
In this review, we will discuss the following products:
– IT Cosmetics Highlight No-Tug Waterproof Gel Eyeliner
– IT Cosmetics Black No-Tug Waterproof Gel Eyeliner
– IT Cosmetics Brow Power Universal Brow Pencil
– YLBB (Your Lips But Better) Romantic Rose Lip Liner Stain
I’ve experienced the No-Tug Waterproof Gel Eyeliners before from the IT Cosmetics Your Most Radiant You 5-pc Holiday 2014 TSV. I had tried a brown/black shade, and I was so excited to try the black one because lately, all the black eyeliners I use on my waterline have been disintegrating quickly! But, this one! HOLY GRAIL STATUS! I’m so in love with this on my waterline.
The Highlight is perfect underneath or even lining your winged liner because it makes your eyes stand out more. I used it in the inner corner of my eye AND under my winged liner, and I loved how it looked. You definitely need this in your life. (Pictures to follow)
The best part about these are they are twist-up, so when they dull, just twist the bottom, and you will get a finer point, as needed.
The IT Cosmetics Universal Taupe Build-a-Brow is one of my FAVORITE brow products, but lately this Brow Power Universal Brow Pencil has been touch and go. And then touching it up with the Build-a-Brow to “gel” it has been perfection!
One side is the pencil, while the other side is the brush. I hardly use the brush as the Brow Power Universal Brow Pencil is pretty light. Just make sure you don’t apply TOO MUCH pressure or it could break and you will be unable to twist it up. Speaking from experience. *Sigh*
I’ve tried lipsticks and lipglosses from IT Cosmetics, but this was my first experience with the YLBB Your Lips But Better Lip Liner Stain. I chose Romantic Rose because I’ve kind of stuck on mauve, and this one did NOT disappoint. Beautiful and smooth. This is truly waterproof because it literally stays on your lips for quite some time. I did find that oil breaks it down, so it’s kind of like a liquid lipstick formula but in pencil form. It is kind of drying and unforgiving, so make sure you exfoliate and moisturize before wearing.
And, the final look:
L-R: IT Cosmetics Black No-Tug Waterproof Gel Eyeliner, Highlight No-Tug Waterproof Gel Eyeliner, Romantic Rose Lip Liner Stain, Brow Power Universal Brow Pencil
What do you think? Will you be picking up any of these?

July 1, 2015 at 5:16 pm
Beautiful look, as always! I love the IT Cosmetics products that I’ve tried so far, but I need more! I will keep the waterline gel eyeliner in mind. I’m using butterLONDON Wink Eye Pencil and I love it because it’s so easy to apply but it does come off my upper waterline and go onto my lower waterline that I don’t line in black. Does this one come off on your bottom waterline?
July 2, 2015 at 10:27 am
I also love the butter London one very much but that one requires sharpening and I prefer twist-up. I only used this on my lower lash line/waterliner. I prefer liquid on the eyelid. 🙂

Yes, this will last a long time! The lip liner is a beauty! I want to try more! ?

I really need to stock up on good lip liners. These look interesting. I’ve been buying MAC. My favorite is Chanel but my god, how many liners can I spend like 40.00 on?

Stephen King and Tim Sample team up for this amusing story about a fireworks competition gone awry. It’s the Maine natives versus the summer people and, with pride on the line, neither is willing to back down. Needless to say, it doesn’t end well. A fun, short (about an hour) listen.Thursday, February 04, 2010
Mirage
Legendary dance music label Mirage Records was formed in 1980 by brother Bob and Jerry Greenberg, Bob holding down the West coast and Jerry setting up office in the East. Jerry had previously been the youngest ever major record company executive, moving to the top position at Atlantic Records at age 32, and both brothers had storied careers in the music and entertainment industry that continues to this day. They have restaurants in Vegas and Jerry was involved in Michael Jackson's music rights holding company, sitting as chairman for Michael throughout the 90's.
Mirage was famous for producing underground electro funk and freestyle records that successfully crossed over to the mainstream. A couple of years ago John Morales remastered a selection of Mirage releases from the original tapes for the small indie re-release label FTG (Funky Town Grooves) records, which released them as an under the radar CD compilation series in the UK. They look like low quality bootlegs from the photoshopped, cheaply printed covers, but they are legit. Please seek these out and buy all 3 volumes so I don't feel so bad about posting a few of these great remasters.
Wait.. I don't feel bad, here is the music:
Break Machine - Break Dance Party
First Love - Can I Be With You Tonight
Terri Jones - Do It Again Tonight
First Love - Give Me Your Love
Norma Jean Wright - Love Attack
Blue Magic - Magic Number
Ingram - Smoothin Groovin
Ingram - When You're Hot Your Hot
The System - You Are In My System

Wow! Great stuff - just when I thought my harddrive couldn't take any more...thanks.
I just put a link to this post in the comments of the Russian blog Raketa 4000 - they are on top of a lot of great new stuff but when they post classics, they seem to flail about searching for material of this caliber. Hope you don't mind I linked here, and I hope they find the link. Peace.

The word garage, when looked up in the dictionary, has a simple meaning: a building or indoor area for parking or storing motor vehicles. By and large, this definition sums up exactly what comes to mind for most folks when they hear the word. But for some, garages are so much more than a space to park the family minivan and store the cumbersome and unattractive trash and recycling bins. Instead, they are functioning spaces of the home that, in the eye of the homeowner, serve just as much purpose as a kitchen or a bathroom and deserve just as much attention to detail.
More and more, people are using garages as a living space — it isn’t just an extra room anymore. Since the 1950s, most garages in North America are of the “attached” variety, meaning they are part of the use of the square footage.
the exterior and interior. appointed to serve as living rooms, sunrooms or a variety of other entertaining spaces that integrate seamlessly with the design and decor of the rest of the home.
A ground-breaking addition to the garage industry is the Trento Collection distributed by Amarr, a leading garage door company with decades of innovation and design experience. Available in an almost unlimited number of looks, doors in the Trento Collection can be customized to fit the architecture of any home. Unlike traditional garage doors that operate via a series of springs, rails and tracks along the ceiling, Trento Collection garage doors showcase revolutionary technology and Italian design, featuring a patented overlap design that allows the door to open by folding neatly in half without any ceiling hardware to clutter the overhead space in the garage. This allows for a Trento door to take up far less space and appear significantly sleeker on the inside and outside than a traditional garage door..

The hospital has been there for several decades and is really a great place to visit. Very educational and informative. They have several permanent residents, but Joey was not one of them. He was there long enought to make sure he was healthy and able to forage and feed on his own. In the meantime, he was used as a turtle travler to the schools. Theis little guy obviously loved his handler, following him around the pool as he walked and talked to the tour. He constantly was reaching toward him with his flipper, trying to get out of the pool.

MY NEW YEAR’S RESOLUTIONS
HAPPY 2018 EVERYONE! There were a few moments back in 2017 I wondered will we ever survive to the 2018 but here we are. Chris Cornell & Chester Bennington dying, that ridiculous world will end soon boom in September, North-Korea losing its shit and well, Trump. Though, I'm not here to chat about any that I've mentioned before. I'm here to chat about MY resolutions for 2018.
LEARN TO EAT AT LEAST THREE NEW MEALS
It's insane how picky I am. And when I'm not able to eat meat at all (not a vegan by own choice), so my options for food are limited. Also, I think I've got some kind of post-traumatic eating disorder after being forced to eat different things in 1st and 2nd grade. That's a storytime for another time. So my goal this year is to start to eat more healthily and at least taste three new things. I mean, the recipes I post here are 99% ones that I personally, have never tasted.
Last year, I found one type of chicken I was able to eat very little without getting nauseous or throw it up immediately and I think that's an amazing news.
START EXERCISING
I want to start a hobby. I know this sounds like a huge cliché because it's the 1st of January but I do, want to start some kind of exercising hobby or so. Thanks to the rheumatoid I'm not able to start anything super heavy, but I thought spinning or yoga would be so much fun to do once a week. I don't want to go to the gym, even though there is a 24/7 one right across the street but I don't have a clue how the stuff works there and I'm generally not a gym person at all. So no gym for me.
After the breast reduction surgery, I feel like all the doors are open for me.
RECYCLE BETTER
Beginning of 2017 we didn't recycle at all. But when I wasn't able to breastfeed D we had a lot of milk cartons around that needed to be recycled. So we started putting them in a different bag instead of the bag we used to put everything else. Also, we started recycling bio, paper, glass and metal. I'm super proud of us, but the end of the last year we became lazy. When bio bag leaks, it's the most disgusting thing on Earth but it still isn't an excuse to stop recycling. So I want to keep this recycling thing going.
MONETIZE LITTLE THINGS WITH JASSY
You read right. I'm struggling with money at the moment. Of course, like most of the people, I've got savings but I'm not going to use them unless I've tried everything possible on Earth. I don't feel like asking my husband to buy me things or buy things for D because he's my husband. Not talking carry around wallet without his own opinions. Even though he covers the food and living, stuff for D at the moment there's no one who covers things for me but myself. And at the moment all my money is going to our rent and I'm left with 7€/month own money to use. We're living tough times, at least in my head.
I'm not going to take any stress about this. I'm going to go with the flow and follow my intuition. I've been studying a lot about monetizing since September 2017 so I'm pretty comfortable, I've got a plan and I'll see if that will work. If it won't, I'll come up with another plan. At least I've got something to do before August when returning to work.
BE ACCEPTED TO SCHOOL
THIS, I've been on a gap year x4 since I graduated upper secondary school. I've been working, started a family and applying to the school. I want to study digital marketing and culture production and I've applied three times already. I'm at the point where even my grandparents ask me have I thought about studying something else and I'm asking that why would I study something I'm not interested in doing for a living.
In a couple of months, it will start and I've already created studying schedule for myself. I'm going to need J more than ever in this, as I really need to get into the school. I'm more determined than ever.
RENOVATE THE WARDROBE
This is a funny goal, as I'm broke. All my clothes are three sizes way too big for me, everything is tents from the time I wanted to hide myself and my breasts. I won't get over the past if I don't get rid of it permanently. That's why I started my little project in September 2017 and so far it has gone okay.

Excellent goals, Jasmin! I blogged my goals today, they're basically improving the blog and it's social, and doing well in other areas of life as well. Good luck with monetizing the blog - it's not the easiest job but it would sure be something you enjoy. :) Also, I wish you luck and consistency with your eating and exercise goals. Those will probably take some time but they can offer you some awesome results.
Thanks! The eating thing is on top of my list :D
These are all impressive goals, hope you achieve them especially the school one and monetising the blog
Thanks :-)

You have set such wonderful goals. You come across as a very perseverant person and I am sure you will achieve each one of these this year!
I love that you want to recycle more, I think we should all try to do that. Maybe you can combine that (more or less) with renovating your wardrobe. It's amazing what you can find at thrift shops!
Good luck with all of your goals and all the best for 2018!

Brilliant achievable goals! Good luck with them. It's good to see so many people having an environmental themed goal this year.

I'm working on the monetization thing too. I've operated blogs before, but this is my first attempt at earning any money from one. I'm not going to stress too much over it, but it'd be nice to have a little extra income from it if I can get there.
In terms of meals I always find myself looking at runonveg.com and recently looking through Run Fast Eat Slow book if you needed any suggestions on places to look for new meals to try :)
In terms of exercising, I’ve been following Lucy Wyndham-Read! Her videos are formatted in that on the left side there’s a beginner version of a move and then on the right there’s an intermediate version - she does a challenge every other month where she posts an exercise video everyday for a month - definitely recommend checking her out!

I made fitness one of my biggest goals in 2017 and I did it all from home, so I have no doubt that you can crush it this year! My blog is going to turn 4 this year and one of my biggest goals is to learn the HTML/CSS that goes behind it so that I can learn how to code my own WordPress themes. We'll see how it goes!
Really hope you achieve the school one! Good Luck in 2018 girl your goals sound really productive x
Morgan //
Wow, great goals but I need a post in more detail on point 1, honestly that was all I could think about as I was reading the others. Good luck with school! I hope you get to go somewhere incredible x

I want to exercise more as well, I started going to the gym in December but I had so much going on that I didn't really have a proper schedule. Now I'm starting pilates as well and hopefully I'll have the time to hit the gym at least once a week :)x

- Bernie remains consistent in his approach to addressing issues, while Hillary evolves.
- The Iraq War: Sanders was on the right side of history, while Clinton supported it.
- Clinton has neoconservative foreign policy that advocates for perpetual war.
- The Keystone XL Pipeline: Bernie Sanders has always been against it, while Clinton supported it.
- The TPP: Sanders has always been against it, while Clinton supported it 45 times.
- Big money interest groups cannot prevent Bernie from introducing much needed reforms, while Hillary would always bend before them.
- Clinton is an establishment politician, while Sanders is a lifelong progressive.
7 Reasons Explained:
1. Bernie remains consistent in addressing issues, while Hillary evolves.
Bernie Sanders has remained consistent with his approach to different issues. What he said back then in the past, he is saying them even today. Hillary Clinton always evolves. Today when presidential race is extremely competitive, she is quick to evolve usually following Bernie's lead on issues. How can a person who continually evolves based upon reasons unknown to the average voter be a better president?
Watch: Hillary Clinton’s Evolution in Motion
2. The Iraq War: Sanders was on the right side of history, while Clinton supported it.
Bernie Sanders voted against the Iraq War. He reached the decision to go against Iraq war using the same intelligence reports as Bush and Clinton. He also predicted the dire consequences of Iraq war. In contrast, Hillary Clinton voted for Iraq and now calls her vote a "mistake."
3. Clinton has neoconservative foreign policy that advocates for perpetual war.
America has suffered enough from a neoconservative foreign policy and one look at icasualties.org highlights this reality.
In contrast, Bernie says, "I'll be damned" if America leads the fight against ISIS. He calls for others to put ground troops in the region, not the US. He puts American soldiers and veterans first, as evident by his recent Congressional Award from the Veterans of Foreign Wars.
Some liberals hate Bush but love Hillary. They forget that Clinton and Bush aren't very different in terms of foreign policy. As Jacob Heilbrunn writes in The New York Times, ."
President Obama just sent American soldiers to Syria, and might even send more . Undoubtedly, a President Hillary Clinton would send more American soldiers to the Middle East and its tell-tale sign can be seen in her Libyan episode. Hillary made laughable joke, "We came, we saw, he died," and then helped usher a devastating civil war in Libya with her decision to oust the Libyan dictator Gaddafi. Had she been President, she would have pushed the US into the Syrian civil war too.
4. The Keystone XL Pipeline: Bernie Sanders has always been against it, while Clinton supported it.
The controversial Keystone XL may threaten water acquirers that irrigate much of the U.S. We know that Bernie Sanders will adamantly resist the Keystone XL. If elected, he will continue President Obama's vetoes of Keystone XL. Hillary Clinton once supported Keystone. As of today, although her decision on the issue has evolved, she cannot be trusted to veto Keystone legislation.
But now she says she's against it. As POLITIFACT states, "It's up to voters to decide how they feel about her changed stance on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, but we rate Clinton's reversal as a Full Flop."
6. Big money interest groups cannot prevent Bernie from introducing much needed reforms, while Hillary would always bend before them.
He could not be influenced by big money as he is running a grass roots campaign. On the other hand, Hillary Clinton will always have to bend before the demands of corporations as she is favored by Wall Street. Four of Clinton's top five donors since 1999 are Wall Street firms. Therefore, President Hillary would not be able to introduce reforms.
Bernie is a genuine reformer who eagerly takes on the "billionaire class." Bernie Sanders wants to break up the banks and reinstate a Glass-Steagall Act. Clinton does not advocate either policy objective.
Economically, Bernie is more progressive in tackling wealth inequality. Clinton also addresses the issue, but continues raking in Wall Street money. Deep rooted Wall Street ties would not be helpful in tackling wealth inequality.
7. Clinton is an establishment politician, while Sanders is a lifelong progressive.
Clinton represents establishment politics, while Sanders opposes it. If you're not voting for Sanders in 2016, forget complaining about Wall Street, perpetual wars, or money in politics. Bernie Sanders is a "once in a lifetime candidate."

Nancy Grace is a Big Fat Poo Poo Head
A jury of 12 peers decides guilt or innocence in this country. It is not perfect but it is the best game in town. About 10 years ago I sat on a jury. We knew the guy was guilty but based on the testimony, evidence and the judge's instructions on the law we were forced to return a not guilty verdict. No one in that jury room was happy. After 3 weeks there were all kinds of strong emotions expressed but we had no choice but to follow the law rather than our hearts. After the trial the judge told us about the large amount of evidence that was not allowed in court for one reason or another and he told us we did the right thing. In fact it was so one sided in court he said he would have reversed the decision if we found him guilty. The system works based upon the law.
I don't know what the jury knew or didn't know outside of the trial. I didn't watch that closely to begin with so this rant is based on the aftermath. The talking heads on HLN and the like can discuss this forever, but the jury could only weigh the evidence and there was reasonable doubt in their opinion. Do they think she is guilty...probably. Did they listen to the law instead of their emotions...yes and good for them.
Prior to this week I thought that Nancy Grace was someone who was the brunt of jokes on the Soup. She is something far worse that that. She is the antithesis of what a reporter should be. She is simply some loud mouth looking to further her career regardless of what her ranting does to lower the level of discourse in our society. She is despicable. She is in fact a great big poo poo head.

Preslova 229/1 (Pisárky) Brno Střed
Public transport: Pavlíkova (Trolejbus 38)
GPS: 49°11'41.78"N, 16°34'53.56"E
Brno attorney Karl Reissig commissioned an unusual project from Vienna-based architect Leopold Bauer in 1925. He wished to build a villa for the manager of his accounting office as a reward for her long-standing services. Miss Valerie Fischer was supposed to remain in the house for the rest of her life; however, this right was revoked ten years later for unknown reasons. Leopold Bauer had already designed a building for Karl Reissig in 1901. Although the house at Hlinky 148 was his first contract, it produced, quoting the period reviews, the most modern building in the empire. However, his architectural thought transformed significantly over following twenty years. Instead of hygiene, simplicity, state-of-the-art technologies and scientific rationality, Bauer favored diversity, historical and regional expressions as well as comfort, ranking him among the less progressive and popular stream of waning historicism.
The four-story building consists of two cubic volumes and is built on the slope at the beginning of Preslova Street. Its cylindrical Renaissance-style corner bays catch the eye from afar. Each story of the villa was originally broken by a different kind of windows, which also revealed its function. The arched windows on the ground floor opened the dining room out to the garden; the formal first floor featured an open arcade with Tuscany-style pillars. The second floor housed Miss Fischer's and her mother's bedrooms, and the top story with small windows and wooden paneling was intended for service facilities. The interior furnishings were no less magnificent. The core of the entire villa was the two-story entrance hall with a fireplace and reliefs by Vienna sculptor Alfred Hoffman, who also created the sculpture of the dancer situated in the hall. The furnishings of the spacious bedroom and bathroom paneled with onyx and located in one of the bays evoked a nearly sacred impression.
World War II brought an end to the original residential function of the villa. The Moravian Museum began to use the villa in the 1950s, but the institution did not interfere with the appearance of the house and preserved the original doors, wainscoting, coffered ceilings, built-in furniture, fireplace with terracotta reliefs and even the onyx panels in the bathroom until 2000. However, following restitution in the 1990s the new owners, due to a lack of any heritage protection legislation, had the house radically reconstructed in 2001, thus destroying the original furnishings of the interiors.

Review:
I honestly will never get tired of this series. This is one of those series that I would love to see it never end, but alas it was written awhile ago and I know there is no hope for it to be longer than six novels. That is ok for now, though, cause this is only the third novel which means I still have three more novels till I have to bawl my eyes out (LMAO).
Just like the last two Meg Cabot's writing style was flawless. I loved every single second of reading it. If you haven't read anything by meg cabot and you love paranormal this is a perfect series for you to start with by her. I highly encourage everyone to read this series. If you haven't read this novel yet or any in the series so far the rest will be spoiler-y so I would skip down to the overall portion =)
I really loved that Suze finally got to open up to one more person about her gift. Yes Gina knew a little bit about it already, but she didn't know any details and I was glad that Suze got to open up to her finally and that she was accepting. I also love that a little more happened between Suze and Jesse. It is not much at all, because he played small appearances in this novel on account of Gina staying in Suze's bedroom, but you can tell their relationship is starting to happen and that hopefully we will see it fully blossom by the end =D I really hope there is a way for them to be together, because I don't want it to end in heartbreak. The last thing I really loved about this novel is Suze has finally realized that she loves her new family. She might not be able to stand her two of her new step brothers most of the time, but she has finally realized that she loves them, they love her, and she will do anything to protect them.
Overall:
I really loved this novel. I don't think there is a single book in this series that I will end up hating. Well, I might hate the last book just for that main reason. Its the last book. (haha). I really wish this series was never ending, because I cannot get enough. I love Suze's character and she continues to make me love her more and more, and Jesse is fantastic and I really hope something happens between them. If you are a Meg Cabot fan and haven't read this series yet YOU NEED TO! And if you haven't tried Meg Cabot yet and love the Paranormal then this is a perfect series for you. I cannot wait to read the next three novels!
Rating: ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ 5/5
Ooh nice! Just skimmed the review to see what you thought! I LOOOOOOOVED this series! I read it years ago, so all my covers are the mismatch bunch! Two hardcovers, all different styles, the first four being under Jenny Carroll! I met Meg last year when she came to my town and got to show them off to others! I like when I have the old retro covers! I do have the newer style on book 6 though, obviously! Although it was a hardcover when I bought it!
Okay, sorry for the ramble! Nice review! I so <3 this series too!
Im so excited that you are loving this series! It is one of my all time favorites. I just love Suz and Jesse.
Great review!
No problem, I love ramblers =D
Thank you for commenting!!
Me too! I am going to be so sad when it ends =(
ooh..i haven't read this series, but your review has me going to check out book one. sweet review!
Yay! You will love this series trust me! everyone!. I'll be attending college in the spring(January 2011) and I have some unanswered questions. What is the difference between fafsa and federal stafford loans? Or is there a difference? Im curious to know. I will be filing as an independent student as I am over the age of 25. I live in the state of North Carolina for reference if needed. I understand there are grants available such as the pell grant but does the school expect you to file for stafford loans to cover tuition or does some part of "financial aid" cover that? I also understand that stafford loans have to be paid back and grants do not...but again, I ask...is financial aid different than stafford loans/grants?!? Please help, Im awfully confused! Thanks so much!
The Fafsa is the form that is required to receive federal and state aid. The Stafford loan is a loan; everyone who received the Stafford filed the Fafsa.
The FAFSA is the free application for all federal student aid. This includes loans like the Subsidized Stafford loan (does not gain interest during your in-school period), and the Unsubsidized Stafford Loan (gains interest while you go to school). It also includes the Federal Pell grant, and the Federal Work Study Program. This is all considered financial aid. Here's the other detail you need to know--since the FAFSA is generally filled out by every student seeking financial aid, it is also the guideline that many scholarship committees and state grant commissions use to determine financial need. So it is a definite must. For this current school year, you can fill it out online, right now using 2009 tax forms. Next step--when you put the schools you are considering on the FAFSA, that application will get sent to them. Their financial aid department will look at your financial information and put together as much aid as they can offer you in this order: 1. Grants and scholarships (If you have applied for scholarships) 2. Work-study (if you have requested it) 3. Loans They will send you a financial aid "award" letter with the amounts and information regarding any deadlines for acceptance of some of the grants. The Pell grant does not have a deadline, so you get it solely based on your need from the FAFSA information, but, depending on the school, the other grants and the work-study usually have deadlines for acceptance. The loans also do not have any deadlines, so you can refuse them then change your mind later if you decide you need some or all of the loan money. You do not have to take the loans. If you can cover your tuition and other expenses using only the grants they offer and your own money, then do it. You can also accept only part of the loans and then later, ask for more of what they offered if you need it. It is likely, this late in the year, that you will only get the Pell grant and the loans offered to you for this school year. Send your acceptances/rejections of financial aid back to the school and they will process it. If they ask you to send your tax forms for verification, do so promptly. They are required to verify a large percentage of their students every year, so don't think they're singling you out. It's pretty much a random draw. After that, you will sign loan forms shortly before school if you accepted loans, and then your aid will just wait until you are ready to start class. For the 2011-2012 school year, on January 2nd, or as soon as possible thereafter, go to, and fill out your FAFSA online using your year-end pay stubs and estimating the numbers that will be on your 2010 tax forms. After April 15th you can go back to update any numbers that might have been wrong. This is perfectly acceptable. IT IS VITAL THAT YOU FILL OUT THE FAFSA new-jersey JANUARY! Here's why--If you qualify for any state grants, you will miss out if you wait until April to fill out the FAFSA. The state grants will be gone by then. The Pell grant will still be around, but it is unlikely you will get any other grant and it could mean you lose a couple thousand more in money you don't have to give back. In the meantime, between January and the new school year, apply, apply, apply for scholarships. The scholarships will be asking for your FAFSA information and sometimes a copy of your award letter from the school so keep a copy of it for yourself. There's lots of money out there. Go get it! Good hunting! Check out and North Carolina's Student Aid Comission -- for more information about federal and state aid. And look for scholarships using

Frank Sinatra - My Way
A classic, easily recognizable song. If you already know this one, give it a second listen. It's a very touching image of a man who dies happily, after living his life to its fullest. There exist many cover versions of this song, but in my opinion, the original is definitely #1. If you are playing an instrument, like piano or an acoustic guitar, try playing it, for example according to this chords , it's a relatively easy number that's good to know. Have a moment of reflection upon your life with this song :)

John Lee Hooker - Serves Me Right To Suffer
Serves me right to be alone. Today I'll show you a classic blues piece. This number is an example of delta blues, one of the earliest forms of blues music. Unless you are living under a rock, you heard this kind of music at least a couple of times - a short lyric, then a short riff, and so on. John Lee Hooker is indisputably a legend of the genre. He inspired generations of bluesmen. Jimi Hendrix himself was very impressed by Hooker's music. Though he may seem not very popular, he had a huge impact on the image of the music, as his compilation albums still come out. Give this one a chance if you enjoy the blues.

Miles Davis - The Jitterbug Waltz
Original by Thomas "Fats" Waller. This jazz masterpiece was covered by many artists, but this one is my personal favorite. Sudden changes in tempo, clever use of different instruments, and very specific mood are what defines this track. When Waller wrote this, he was inspired by his son's piano exercises. It was mainly played on the pipe organ. What added certain depth to it, was Davis' use of many instruments. If you enjoy video games, you might like to know, that Waller's original was used in Bioshock 2.
If you're in a mood for a glass of whiskey, put this on and you won't regret it.

Mountain - Mississippi Queen
A hard rock classic foreshadowing of what's to come in 70s. The opening guitar riff is still easily recognizable. Its rich, "meaty" sound, probably inspired by Led Zeppelin was very popular at the time. The song appeared in the recent movie "The Expendables" by Sylvester Stallone. Covered by Ozzy Osbourne in 2005 - in my opinion, he managed to retain the original "spirit" of the track, but made it slightly different, due to his unusual voice and Jerry Cantrells characteristic guitar playing. I think the original is often overlooked, but remains a leading example of early hard rock. Enjoy.

Subskrybuj: Posty (Atom)Stenosis Qualitative
Straight to the Heart
- This reviews qualitative but complex physical aspects of flow through a restricted orifice.
- Fluid flow through the stenotic orifice is associated with a pressure gradient that supplies the acceleration force. Velocity reaches a maximum shortly downstream of the physical orifice at the vena contracta; the velocity there is significantly greater than would be predicted by a simplistic description of the geometry (area change).
- Downstream of the vena contracta, the fluid "decelerates" (acceleration opposite to the direction of flow) due to increasing pressure in the downstream direction ("pressure recovery") and dramatic (viscous) friction forces that are amplified by turbulence.
- Under appropriate circumstances, there is little energy lost on the center streamline upstream of the vena contracta; a stenosis is NOT a "resistance". This allows us to apply the simplified Bernoulli equation on the central streamline within in this confined region. Although there is a dramatic decrease in pressure across the stenosis ("gradient"), this energy is not lost but rather converted into kinetic energy, the mass and velocity of the fluid. Energy loss due to friction occurs primarily in the pressure recovery zone where pressure is actually increasing in the downstream direction.
- A stenosis sets the stage for a drastic range in the hemodynamic environment that includes turbulence downstream of the constriction and large variations in pressure, velocity, and shear forces. We see some fluid elements trapped near the stenosis in a "recirculation zone" and others that spin like a top ("vorticity").
- The Reynolds number is a ratio of inertial to viscous forces and is a necessary descriptor that determines the "shape" of a flow whenever there is a convective acceleration (change in fluid velocity with location).
I suspect that anyone reading this page (5 of you to date!) is likely quite familiar with the qualitative aspects of stenosis flow from daily experience in cardiology. I hope this review will provide perspective by showing and analyzing the results of computational fluid dynamic solutions (CFD). Go to the PREVIOUS PAGE for a link pathway to see how you can make your own images from the example computations. Solutions for axis-symmetric stenosis flow will be presented recurrently where a two-dimensional representation of the flow is shown. A picture's worth 1000 words, so I hope you get the idea from this figure:
In all that follows, flow enters from the left-hand side of the figure into a virtual cylindrical conduit with uniform radius until reaching an obstruction which consists of an orifice plate, essentially a wall with a circular hole in it at the center line of the parent tube. The stenosis flow models here are simplistic of course, as representations of the geometry that occurs in the heart. However the physical principles depicted apply both to stenosis and valvular regurgitation. All of the flows shown here are time invariant. That isn't a limitation of the method, just a limitation of practicality for presentation of the concepts.
Flow through a stenosis necessitates acceleration of fluid elements; velocity increases on the upstream side of the constriction but also must decrease on the downstream side. Both of these situations constitute acceleration, the latter being a vector quantity. In the setting of fluid dynamics, acceleration is a vector field - a vector quantity that typically varies with location in space (it also changes with time, but not in this discussion). Acceleration in the direction of motion increases speed, opposite the direction of motion decreases speed. Acceleration perpendicular to the direction of motion does not change the speed of the fluid element, only the direction of motion. The acceleration vector can, and typically does have components that change both the magnitude and direction of the velocity vector. Without having any prior knowledge of how this occurs, we might naïvely guess the following figure as a first approximation of the flow representation:
Here is depicted a uniform velocity at each axial location – the same unvarying velocity over the entire tube cross section, but varying with axial location and the cross-sectional area; no radial velocities appear. The numerical value of the uniform axial velocity is:
\(\Large \bar{u}_x(x) = \frac{q}{A(x)} \)
Here,\(\bar{u}_x(x)\) is the average axial velocity at location \(x\). \(u\) is used to represent velocity to avoid confusing it with voltage or volume; subscript \(x\) is to indicate the component of velocity in the axial direction and the \(x\) in parentheses indicates that the value can change with axial location. \(q\) is the volume flow rate (e.g. mL/sec) and \(A(x)\) is the physical cross-sectional area (e.g. cm2) which also can vary with axial coordinate, \(x\). In the particular example case shown above and below, the stenosis orifice area is \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the parent tube area (\(\frac{1}{2}\) the diameter) so the average velocity there is \(4\) times the value of the parent tube. For incompressible flow in a rigid conduit (with no inlets or outlets), the flow rate is invariant with axial location. Notice however that both the cross-sectional area, and consequently \( \bar{u}_x\), can change abruptly - discontinuously - with axial location.
Of course the actual flow cannot occur as suggested by the above figure. The cross-sectional area can change discontinuously, but the actual velocities cannot since that would constitute an infinite acceleration. The next figure is a more realistic approximation of the actual flow from the CFD solution showing velocity depicted as vectors but also by the color scale:
The figure depicts the calculated velocity vectors for this simple stenosis geometry with flow in the parent tube occurring at a prescribed Reynolds number of 1000. Flow enters at the left side of the figure with a prescribed uniform velocity of 1.0 (so the vectors at the far left also serve the purpose of a velocity scale legend). We can refer to the variation of velocity over the cross section as the "velocity profile". If you look closely, you'll see that the velocity profiles are never entirely uniform; the velocity always approaches 0.0 near the wall of the conduit ( upper border of the flow figure). In fact the fluid at the wall always must move at the same velocity as the wall, zero in this particular situation (the "no slip" condition). Since we know that the flow rate is the same at every axial location, slow moving fluid near the wall means that fluid elsewhere must move faster than the cross-sectional average. The slow moving fluid near a solid boundary is called a boundary layer. A boundary layer will always occur when the fluid possesses viscosity and ALL biological fluids are viscous. In effect, a boundary layer excludes high velocity flow from occurring immediately adjacent to a wall and for a variable distance away from the wall. This also means that the cross-sectional area available for flow is effectively smaller than the physical area. There will always be fluid elements moving faster than the computed average, \(\bar{u}_x(x)\), at every axial location.
At the seventh velocity profile from the left, i.e. at the physical stenosis, velocity has increased dramatically but in a way that might not have been anticipated. Clearly some of the velocity vectors are NOT directed axially only; the vectors include a significant radial component, in this case directed towards the centerline (lower edge of the figure) so that the flow is actual converging towards the centerline as it passes the physical stenosis. The component of velocity that is not directed axially does not contribute to the axial flow rate. Hence this too is velocity in excess of the average value. Furthermore we see again that there are relatively slower velocity vectors at the very edge of the physical stenosis. The specific velocities generated by the flow geometry contribute to the stenosis; the fluid flow itself is a component of the stenosis.
To delve a little further, you can see that it doesn't look like there's much of a radial velocity component at the centerline (there's actually NONE right at the centerline), yet velocity actually increases at the centerline due to the flow contraction. Flow velocity at the centerline is being enhanced from contributions by radial velocities farther away from the centerline. The continuity equation for this situation (axis-symmetric flow in a polar geometry) looks like this:
\(\Large \frac{\partial u_x}{\partial x} + \frac{u_r}{r} + \frac{\partial u_r}{\partial r} = 0\)
\(u_x\) is the velocity component in the axial direction, \(u_r\) is velocity in the radial direction. The first term, \(\partial u_x/\partial x\) has to do with how much the axial velocity is increasing as we move in the \(x\) direction (downstream). The equation shows that this is contributed to by radial velocity, \(u_r/r\), but also by a radial velocity gradient, \(\partial u_r/\partial r\).The fact that the radial component of velocity is changing in the radial direction also adds to the axial velocity. (I just didn't want you to think that anything slipshod was going on here.)
The next figure represents the velocity again in the alternative format of a contour plot which allows us to quickly identify regions of high and low velocity; lost in this depiction is the directional information afforded by the vector format. The figure clearly shows the location of the vena contracta, outlined by the red contour at the conduit centerline (lower edge of the plot), about half a diameter downstream from the physical stenosis. Qualitatively the vena contracta is always downstream of the physical stenosis although it's shape depends on the Reynolds number (see below) and the specific configuration of the stenosis geometry. For example, I learned from these numerical experiments that the vena contracta does not necessarily reside at the centerline. Picture a mild stenosis where the orifice plate does not protrude into the stream very far. In that case the vena contracta could be displaced from the centerline, forming a toroid (donut shape) in a three-dimensional representation.
Shown on the far right-hand side of the figure is the color velocity scale which has been configured to represent the full range of velocities of the plot; the maximum velocity at the vena contracta is 5.865 in this case. In this example, the velocity there is almost 1.5 times the average velocity at the physical stenosis ( 4.0 ). There would be a substantial error in estimating the stenosis flow velocity from flow rate and stenosis cross-sectional area alone. Note that the actual velocity at the vena contracta will always be greater than the value computed from the flow rate and physical stenosis area.
As promised by Newton's laws, the fluid is accelerated in moving from the inlet at the left of the plot to the location of maximal velocity at the vena contracta. This acceleration must be caused by a net force which is due principally to the pressure gradient in this instance. In clinical terminology, pressure gradient is often reported as a single number with physical units of pressure. More correctly however, pressure gradient is another vector field with a magnitude and direction at each location; it has physical units of pressure/distance (stress/length). In any case, the figure below depicts the intense spatial variation of pressure in the vicinity of the stenosis that all cardiologists are familiar with from cath lab experience. The figure suggests a structure to this pressure field, however, that is not readily appreciated from sliding a catheter back and forth across a valve. Notice for example that the pressure gradient is not directed only axially in the immediate vicinity of the stenosis, but that there is marked pressure variation from the conduit centerline to the wall. For the particular model shown, the pressure gradient force acts to accelerate the fluid towards the centerline on the upstream side of the stenosis and away from the centerline on the downstream side.
Comparison of this figure with the one above will allow you to appreciate the fact that the vena contracta (velocity maximum) coincides with the physical location of a pressure minimum, a region bounded in the above figure by the contours of the deepest blue color. Downstream of this location, the pressure begins to increase in the axial direction in the "pressure recovery" zone. A subsequent figure will allow you to better appreciate this latter aspect of the physics. However it should come as no surprise to you that the fluid continuing downstream from the vena contracta must be subjected to a force opposite the direction of motion for the velocity to return to the more sedate values downstream of the vena contracta. That force again derives from a pressure gradient acting to accelerate the fluid in the upstream direction, an adverse pressure gradient (synonymous with "pressure recovery" here). Fluid deceleration at this location also derives from frictional forces to a much greater extent than was true upstream of the stenosis.
Before leaving this figure, it's worth noting that the pressure field settles down, from the location of the vena contracta and downstream, so that the pressure has little variation over the cross section; the pressure gradient force is directed essentially upstream or downstream with no appreciable radial component. This is referred to sometimes as a "plane pressure" approximation (pretty much always assumed for clinical purposes).
The above figure is just a recap of the pressure field to show the extent of the pressure recovery zone (PRZ) starting at the vena contracta, where there is a local pressure minimum, extending a couple of diameters downstream to a local pressure maximum before the pressure begins to decrease in the downstream direction due to the usual mechanism of pressure loss (friction). The extent of this PRZ will depend on many things relating to the geometry and flow parameters. I know that it is a common source of confusion to clinicians that the pressure can be increasing in the downstream direction following a stenosis. The clinical literature sometimes applies the term "resistance" for quantifying stenosis severity, but this is a misnomer that contributes to the confusion in my opinion. The term "resistance" in both electrical terminology and in physical hemodynamics has to do specifically with a loss of energy (pressure) due to friction. This has little to do with the predominant physical processes occurring in the immediate vicinity of a stenosis. The pressure drop across a stenosis can be thought of as a conversion of pressure "energy" into kinetic energy of the fluid (more technically the pressure does work on the fluid to increase its kinetic energy). There is little energy lost to friction there and, in fact, application of the simplified Bernoulli equation makes the approximation that NO energy is lost. On the downstream side of the stenosis, some of the kinetic energy of the fluid is "recovered" and pressure increases (pressure does negative work on the fluid and decreases its kinetic energy). There's no one to stop you from applying the resistance formula in the region downstream of a stenosis, but this is inappropriate and you would find nonsensically that the resistance value is negative there if you do.
The next figure was generated by "labeling" fluid elements at the inlet of the conduit (far left) and ALSO at the vertical white line that transects the flow image; fluid paths were tracked through the stenosis and also as they orbit slowly in a recirculation zone. Color represents the speed of the fluid elements so you don't get bored. A dividing streamline separates the flow into 2 regions that have no flow communication with each other in a strictly mathematical sense. The dividing streamline also shows where boundary layer separation occurs, at the edge of the stenosis orifice in this case. This recirculation zone is a region of slowly flowing fluid that is separated from the main stream by a boundary layer that is detached from the wall. The location of boundary layer reattachment is not included in the figure but would be off screen to the right. In 3 dimensions, the dividing streamline is asurface that sequesters the recirculation zone from the rest of the flow although the rapidly moving jet is the source of energy to keep the recirculation zone moving.
Here we begin to see how extremes in hemodynamic environment can occur in the vicinity of a physical disruption of the flow field. The figure would imply that fluid in the recirculation zone is trapped there forever since there are no streamlines that traverse the zone – no pathway in to or out of it. The observation of such circumstances led researchers to consider whether a location such as this might be predisposed to disease ( such as atherosclerosis ) as a result of increased time of residence (for fluid, particles, chemicals, etc.) or decreased flow rate. Such circumstances do indeed relate to disease production and a principal contributor seems to be the decrease in shear stress at the endothelium resulting from the slower fluid flow; this alteration in physical environment results in endothelial dysfunction and diminished release of endothelial nitric oxide. In reality, pulsatility, turbulence, and minor variations in flow geometry prevent the pictured recirculation zone from being entirely sequestered from the main stream. Fully three-dimensional flows can result in some very interesting pathways by which fluid can both enter and exit these slow flow regions.
I'll also reminder you here that these computations employ a turbulence model called the \(k-\epsilon\) model. In consequence the velocities and fluid element paths shown are a kind of average expectation, a mean velocity vector at each location. A manifestation of turbulence is that it superimposes a seemingly random velocity onto the mean velocity vector; the magnitude of the random vector is related to the turbulence intensity (more below). The turbulence is isotropic in the \(k-\epsilon\) model meaning the magnitude of the turbulence vector is independent of direction; that's one of the limitations of the model.
The next figure focuses on the location of the boundary layer reattachment where the dividing streamline from the previous figure ends up touching the wall of the of the tube (not seen on the above figure). This is included just so you know what we are looking for to identify boundary layer reattachment. On either side of the reattachment point ( upstream and downstream ) we can see that the velocity vectors adjacent to the wall point away from the spot. This means that the fluid is flowing downstream to the right of this point and upstream to the left side of it. The point of boundary layer separation has the opposite characteristic – velocity vectors point towards the point of separation on both the upstream and downstream sides.
Why does boundary layer separation occur? It often has to do with an adverse pressure gradient – i.e. the pressure recovery zone. In such a region, pressure force acts opposite to the direction of flow. Since there will always be a region of slow moving fluid next to the wall, "deceleration" ( acceleration opposite the direction of flow ) affects this fluid by actually reversing the direction of motion. The dotted line in the figure below suggests the location of the boundary layer and you can see why there will be a region next to the wall where the fluid flows upstream, just as it does in the computations shown. The boundary layer separation for the stenosis occurs right at the tip of the obstruction (the valve "leaflet") making it difficult to illustrate with the computations in this example.
The figure above (showing how the fluid velocity vectors relate to boundary layer reattachment) illustrates another interesting attribute of the flow, that of entrainment. We know that the flow rate for the rigid tube is invariant with location. Yet the presence of the recirculation zone, with velocity vectors directed opposite to the main flow near the wall, means that there is a region near the wall where fluid flows upstream. Consequently the recirculation zone is also a region in the conduit where there is an increase in the actual downstream flow rate. The main jet entrains fluid from the surroundings so that the total forward flow is actually increased. The following figure quantifies that effect for the flow solution depicted, showing the forward flow as a ratio, i.e. total forward flow divided by the invariant flow rate.
The recirculation zone starts at the physical stenosis (axial coordinate 0.0) and increasing entrainment occurs to a maximum of almost 20%, i.e. nearly 20% of \(q\) (the invariant flow rate) flows upstream with 120% of \(q\) flowing downstream. Does entrainment contribute to the enhanced forward flow velocity at the vena contracta? Hmmmm.... I wouldn't say so myself.
Technical Note: The solution exhibits a "glitch" at the location of the physical stenosis that I believe is due to the physically implausible geometry specification. This stenosis has sharp corners on it that translate into an unrealistic "singular" boundary condition with a 0.0 velocity specification right next to a high velocity point. The small stencil pressure projection method used here does not enforce numerically exact mass conservation for the finite volume method. While the numerical solution has converged, this discontinuity introduces the spike and wobble in the flow rate seen above.
The next 2 images depict the "Total Energy" of the fluid defined as \(p + \rho |u|^2/2\) (also known as total pressure or stagnation pressure). This is an important clinical concept since application of the Simplified Bernoulli Equation is dependent upon the result. The first figure below shows contour lines that indicate the variation of total energy in the vicinity of the stenosis. There is an inviscid core of fluid from the inlet and extending essentially to the location of the vena contracta. The fluid here is not actually inviscid - it has the same viscosity as elsewhere. What's inviscid is the way in which the fluid flows – the fluid layers do not shear against each other significantly. When a fluid flows in this way there is little/no energy lost as the fluid element moves along a streamline.
As we all know, the clinically applicable guts of the Bernoulli equation appears as follows:
\(\Large p_1 + \frac{\rho}{2} |u_1|^2 = p_2 + \frac{\rho}{2} |u_2|^2 + L_{\mu}\)
The quantity \(L_{\mu}\) here is used to represent an energy loss due to friction where \(\mu\) refers to the viscosity of the fluid. The figure depicts the inviscid core where \(L_{\mu}\) is negligible; this is the only region of the stenosis flow where the Simplified Bernoulli Equation is applicable.
The subsequent figure also shows total energy represented by color; fluid element paths (streamlines) have been illustrated to show how the conduit center streamline ( lower edge of the flow figure ) lies within the inviscid core and extends from the inlet to the vena contracta along the tube. Our ability to estimate the pressure difference between the inlet and the vena contracta is dependent on the velocity measurements obtained at these 2 locations as we all know. Furthermore the value of \(\large u_1\) is often negligible with respect to \(\large u_2\)so that the pressure difference is approximated by the well-known SBE:
\(\Large \Delta p = \frac{\rho}{2} |u_2|^2\)
The figure also illustrates streamlines originating near the wall of the conduit (upper left) that do not maintain the inlet energy level to the level of the vena contracta; this is apparent from yellow, green, and blue streamlines that extend from the edge of the stenosis. Although pressure is essentially constant over the cross-section at the vena contracta, fluid elements following these streamlines have lost energy due to intense shears ( viscous friction ) that occurs as the fluid flows past the obstruction. Although the fluid on the center streamline retains virtually all its energy up to the location of the vena contracta, the total stream issuing through the stenosis does not. We'll explore this in mathematical detail in a subsequent article.
This section relates to an issue that likely would only interest an engineer; it deals with an apparent discrepancy in the flow solution that may have some clinical relevance, but not much. I'd welcome any comments from engineers on the explanation given.
The "Total Energy" (or "Total Pressure") contour plot above depicts a situation that seems physically unrealistic - total energy increasing in the direction of flow along a streamline. I have assumed for some time that this represents either a bug in my software, or that the model is inadequate. However close review of these solutions causes me to suspect that this may actually be a realistic aspect of the flow. For flow along a streamline, the simplified Bernoulli equation assumes that the effect of friction is always a decrease in energy:
\(\Large p_1 + \frac{\rho}{2} |u_1|^2 = p_2 + \frac{\rho}{2} |u_2|^2 + L_{\mu}\)
This is not entirely correct however. Surrounding fluid that is moving faster than the elements on the streamline of interest can exert a drag force in the direction of flow. In that situation, there is positive shear work done on the fluid element that causes an increase in total energy along the streamline. Furthermore, turbulence increases the transfer of energy across streamlines dramatically, i.e. through convection. I believe that this may be the explanation for what appears to be a physically implausible aspect of the solution. Certainly total energy of the closed system cannot increase without an internal source, but fluid elements can transfer energy to others by this mechanism.
The following figure depicts velocity vectors at the physical stenosis where a color scale adjustment illustrates the fact that the highest velocity fluid elements are not at the centerline at this axial position; elements with the highest velocity surround the centerline as a ring that is closer to rim of the obstruction. These elements have the potential to transfer energy to streamlines closer to the centerline through shear stress (friction). They can literally drag more centrally located fluid elements in the direction of flow, increasing their total energy.
The velocity contour plot, reprise below, helps conceptualize how a ring (in 3D) of relatively high velocity issues forward from the physical stenosis with lower velocities nearer the centerline.
The above 2 figures illustrate (perhaps) an "obvious" situation where energy could be added to a streamline through drag forces. However more subtle circumstances might also cause this result. All that is necessary is a net positive shear force in the direction of the flow which could result from nuances of the velocity profile that aren't readily visualized. Turbulent energy transfer may also contribute although turbulence intensity isn't particularly high at this location (see below).
The next figure depicts color adjusted streamlines with the lowest color value (blue) set to the total energy at the inlet (centerline pressure plus kinetic energy = 0.5). Consequently any color other than deep blue depicts where streamliine energy has risen above the inlet. The figure includes the highest energy hot spots occurring in the flow.
I've observed this increase in Total Energy for many of my own numerical studies (it's consistent) and also on stenosis problems that were run on FLUENT (it's not my software only). I think this may be realistic aspect of the flow. Digression over.
The following 2 plots show the centerline velocity as a function of axial location and subsequently both pressure and "total energy" as previously defined. Both the pressure and total energy plots assume an arbitrary datum of \(0.0\) at the centerline of the tube inlet. The axial coordinate is indicated in terms of tube diameters with \(0\) being the location of the physical stenosis. For the velocity plot, there is a uniform velocity of \(1.0\) at the inlet which increases markedly to the maximal value ~1/2 diameter downstream of the physical stenosis at the vena contracta. Subsequently the centerline velocity gradually decreases with the flow deceleration. The velocity profile never returns to the uniform velocity however, so the centerline velocity remains elevated above the cross-sectional average of \(1.0\).
A plot of the pressure distribution along the axial centerline clearly demonstrates the dramatic decrease in pressure across the stenosis to a local minimum at the vena contracta that we're all familiar with. For this particular situation, pressure recovery occurs from the vena contracta to ~2 diameters downstream of the stenosis. A transition occurs from there to ~3 diameters at which point the pressure approaches a stable decline rate due to viscous dissipation. In a model with turbulence, such as this, the rate of pressure loss is increased above the value predicted by the Poiseuille solution of \(8 \mu q / (\pi r_0^4)\) per unit of conduit length.
The centerline total energy plot depicts constant total energy in the region upstream of the stenosis, then a seemingly implausible increase in energy near the physical stenosis (See Technical Digression above). The important aspect of this plot is the fact that energy remains essentially at the inlet level, within the inviscid core flow, until energy losses begin downstream of the vena contracta. Further downstream, there is rather dramatic energy loss in the vicinity of the pressure recovery zone; energy decline actually approaches maximal in a region where pressure is increasing in the downstream direction. So this is an interesting region where kinetic energy is being dissipated (lost) as heat as well as being returned to "pressure energy". If we were to calculate the "resistance" in this zone (\(\Delta p/q\)), the value would be negative despite the fact that energy loss is greatest here. (I'm not recommending that you do this. I'm telling you it's not applicable.) Energy loss gradually transitions downstream to parallel the pressure tracing where energy decline is essentially reflected entirely by the pressure decline. Total energy on the centerline remains elevated relative to the pressure tracing since the kinetic energy on the centerline is greater than it was at the inlet (see the velocity plot above).
We'll consider now some nuances of the flow; these may have importance relative to clinical problems such as endothelial damage and predisposition to endocarditis. Downstream of the obstruction, there is a region where fluid velocity changes rapidly over a short distance; there is a marked velocity gradient perpendicular to the direction of flow. In the velocity contour plot below, the square bracket implies where this region is occurring. It originates at the edge of the obstruction and the velocity gradient gradually decreases downstream from that location, i.e. the variation of velocity becomes more gradual. This flow field implies a circumstance where each fluid element experiences a higher velocity on the centerline side than on the side towards the conduit wall. Each fluid element is spinning in this region. There is a well-defined means to express this fact in a quantitative sense call the vorticity that has to do with the velocity gradients. Vorticity is another vector field quantity that indicates both the magnitude and direction of spin for each fluid element in accordance with the right-hand rule. The circle-with-arrow on the plot suggests the direction of spin for the fluid elements in the shear layer. If you use your right hand with your fingers curled around the direction of spin, your thumb points in the direction of the vorticity vector, i.e. directly out of the computer screen towards you in this case.
The software used to create these images ( downloadable at this site ) allows for vorticity vectors stemming from the CFD solutions to be displayed. However all of the vectors are either directed straight into the screen or straight out of it for these two-dimensional flows. Consequently we can simply represent the vorticity magnitude with another contour plot (below).
This shows what we had already surmised from the previous plot, that the fluid in the vicinity of the obstruction (e.g. valve leaflet ) is spinning like crazy. I'll make no claim as to the accuracy of the values shown which occur in a singular region of the solution (not very accurate); we are only trying to gain a qualitative understanding of how flow occurs in the vicinity of the stenosis.
While I'm at it, there is another location of high vorticity at the upper left-hand corner. This one is due to an artifact caused by the way the flow at the inlet was specified, i.e. uniform velocity all the way across. This specification actually implies a velocity discontinuity - another numerical singularity; the velocity is zero at the wall but full speed ahead right next to the wall. This flow velocity specification is unrealistic and just a lazy man's way of indicating how much flow is entering the system. We know ahead of time that this is an implausible specification and simply accept the fact that the flow field in the immediate vicinity of this location is not going to be very useful/accurate. Interestingly, vorticity behaves as a conserved quantity that is transferred along with the flow, just like heat, green dye, or any other material that can be transported and defused in a fluid.
The next contour plot depicts the turbulence intensity generated by the \(k-\epsilon\) turbulence model. As noted previously this model is likely rather inaccurate for the complex flows generated by a stenosis, but the plot affords a qualitative understanding of the flow physics. The turbulence intensifies in the shear layer downstream of the edge of the obstruction and expands to include much of the cross sectional area of the conduit. While cardiologists look at Doppler ultrasound depictions of turbulence on a daily basis, these do not necessarily coincide with more rigorous definitions and analyses. I believe the plot likely affords a better understanding of the turbulence surrounding a stenosis than clinical determinations allow. There are more detailed observations available in the hemodynamics literature.
While we all have a notion about what it is, turbulence is quite a difficult topic at the analytical level. Nobel laureate Richard Feynman said that turbulence is "the most important unsolved problem of classical physics.". Horace Lamb reportedly addressed the British Association for the Advancement of Science saying, "I am an old man now, and when I die and go to heaven there are two matters on which I hope for enlightenment. One is quantum electrodynamics, and the other is the turbulent motion of fluids. And about the former I am rather optimistic."The solutions you see here show a grid where values of the velocity and pressure are computed at each cell. These CFD problems were solved on my desktop PC. Calculations for turbulent flows without using a "turbulence model" require a MUCH finer grid than you see and a supercomputer.
Turbulence is markedly predisposed to by the presence of an adverse pressure gradient, a circumstance we have already seen is in effect in this region of the flow. I'm sure I've emphasized it elsewhere, but it's worth saying again that virtually all the clinical circumstances that result in turbulence and a murmur are associated with the emergence of flow into an expanded region and the presence of an adverse pressure gradient. This circumstance results in a much lower critical Reynolds number than the 2000-2300 for a straight cylindrical tube with smooth walls.
What Do You Mean by "Reynolds Number"?
This section touches on one of the most fundamental aspects of fluid dynamics – dynamic similarity. It is necessary to understand the meaning and impact of this concept before we can begin to discuss the topic of stenosis "flow dependence". The Reynolds number is a ratio of inertial (specifically the fluidconvective acceleration) to viscous forces that qualify how a flow will occur. Being a ratio of 2 quantities having the same physical units, the Reynolds number is a dimensionless number ( no physical units ). When comparing flowing fluids from one situation to another, we MUST take the Reynolds number into account and the fluid engineering literature ALWAYS includes this specification since results cannot be interpreted otherwise. You'll also see references to the "flow regime" for a particular real life situation ( like aortic stenosis for example ) which is the range of Reynolds numbers, and possibly/likely other nondimensional flow parameters that govern the situation.
I think many cardiologists are familiar with the formula for the Reynolds number of a cylindrical conduit and I even saw it on a board question once.
\(\Large Re =\LARGE \frac{\rho\;d\;|u|}{\mu}\)
Other folks might spit back a number when the topic comes up, 2000-2300? This would be the "critical" Reynolds number (\(Re_{crit}\)) at which the transition to turbulence typically occurs in a straight cylindrical tube with smooth walls. The size of the convective acceleration of the general problem is approximated as \(\rho |u|^2\) where \(|u|\) is a velocity that characterizes the situation. The viscous friction term relates to the viscosity of the fluid and a velocity gradient, it's approximated as \(\mu |u|/d\). The appearance of the diameter (\(d\)) in the formula has to do with the fact that the velocity gradient relates to a velocity change over distance. If it weren't a tube, we would replace the \(d\) ( diameter ) in the formula with a more general characteristic length (\(l\)); \(l\) might refer to the thickness of a wing or the length of a ship under other circumstances. Divide the \(\rho |u|^2\) stuff by \(\mu |u|/d\) and out comes the Reynolds number.
ALL CFD problems are calculated by solving for nondimensional variables right from the start. In part, this is done to isolate the effect of the Reynolds number on the solution. In the following nondimensional quantities are denoted with a tilde (~) over the symbol. All the velocities in the solution are velocity ratios:
\(\Large \tilde{u} \equiv \LARGE \frac{u}{|\bar{u}|}\)
For our situation, \(|\bar{u}|\) is the cross sectional mean of the parent conduit as before. All the distances and sizes are in terms of length ratios (measured in diameters in this case):
\(\Large \tilde{x} \equiv \LARGE \frac{x}{d}\)
All the pressures are ratios too:
\(\Large \tilde{p} \equiv \LARGE \frac{p}{\rho |\bar{u}|^2} \)
If we want to apply the CFD solution to a real-life situation, we need to reverse the above process; multiply \(\tilde{u}\) by \(|\bar{u}|\), \(\tilde{x}\) by \(d\), and \(\tilde{p}\) by \(\rho |\bar{u}|^2\), to convert to CFD solution values to the distances, velocities, and pressures for the actual aorta, airplane, spacecraft, etc. This is considered a trivial step in the engineering world (and believe me – it is trivial compared to calculating the CFD solution). But this same solution is applicable to every situation with the prescribed relative geometry and Reynolds number. We don't have to recalculate a solution just because we're dealing with an elephant versus a mouse if the Reynolds number is the same (it isn't). In more familiar terms, it doesn't bother you if you're given a drug dosage in mg/kg (per kilogram of body mass) and you have to do a multiplication to determine the dose for a specific individual.
Similarly, we have to look at a solution of appropriate Reynolds number if we want to understand how a flow occurs in the real-life situation we are studying. Suppose the aorta has a 2.75 cm diameter, an average velocity during ejection of 60 cm/sec, blood density and viscosity of 1.0 and 0.035 Poise respectively, etc. (Poise is a unit of viscosity having physical dimensions of gm cm-1sec-1) The Reynolds number would be 1.0 (gm/cm3) x 2.75 (cm) x 60 (cm/sec) / 0.035 (gm cm-1 sec-1) ~ 4714. For pulsatile flow it turns out there is at least one other nondimensional parameter we have to concern ourselves with that essentially is a nondimensional frequency (\(\alpha = r \sqrt{\rho \omega /\mu}\) where \(r\) is tube radius, \(\omega = 2\pi f\) or angular frequency. More specifically, \(\alpha\) is proportional to the square root of frequency).
Up until here, this article has described the results for just one flow solution for a specific geometry at a single Reynolds number of 1000. The following figures depict CFD solutions for thesamestenosis geometry as for the above figures, but at a range of Reynolds numbers from 25 to 5000. This is a rather wide range that doesn't necessarily occur for mammalian stenosis flows; I wanted the differences to be readily visible to the naked eye. ALL the CFD solutions have the same prescribed nondimensional inlet velocity ratio (1.0), dimensions (parent tube diameter = 1.0), and flow rate (\(\pi/4\)). In essence, fluid velocity and geometry are the same for all the solutions. All of the following examples have the same "flow rate"; the only thing that varies is the Reynolds number.
The next 4 conjoined figures illustrate the velocity contour plots; the Reynolds number is shown in the text for each plot. All are displayed with the same velocity color scale with contour spacing of 0.2 (no dimensions). All I'm trying to get across here is that the Reynolds number affects the shape of the flow. This includes all of the attributes discussed above such as the size and location of the vena contracta, recirculation zone, velocity gradient of the shear layer, etc. We see that the peak velocity at the vena contracta is similar between the solutions, but there will turn out to be quantitative differences.
The next 4 figures depict the actual velocity (ratio) vectors and this allows us more insights as to how the flows differ. A low Reynolds number flow has a relatively high level of viscous friction. Note for example the seventh velocity profile from the left - at the physical constriction. The velocity profile of the low Reynolds number flow exhibits a rounded appearance with a gradually increasing velocity in the progression from the edge of the stenosis to the centerline. Hence there is a relatively thick boundary layer in this example. An effectively thicker boundary layer excludes high velocity flow for a greater distance from the wall, effectively narrowing the stenosis and increasing the velocity at the vena contracta. With the progression of increasing Reynolds number, the velocity profile at the physical constriction exhibits a much steeper velocity gradient at the edge of of the physical constriction (thinner boundary layer) but also a significantly larger component of the velocity that is not directed axially; i.e. there is a greater component of the velocity directed towards the centerline. This convergent flow was noted above as another mechanism by which vena contracta velocity is increased above the simple area ratio prediction (\(4.0\)). Consequently the vena contracta velocity is increased above the area ratio prediction at higher Reynolds numbers, but for a different reason than the lower Reynolds number case.
The final plots trace the pressure and velocity along the centerline of the conduit for 4 values of the Reynolds number. The pressure drop (clinical "gradient") and change in velocity are similar for all 4, but with quantitative differences that can be difficult to predict without the calculations or a controlled bench top experiment. (The cath lab is a poor venue for learning the essentials of fluid dynamics; too many uncontrolled variables.)
The centerline pressure plot depicts the local pressure minimum at the vena contracta, a location that varies somewhat with Reynolds number. Variations in pressure gradient, pressure recovery, and rate of pressure decline downstream are all evident. In general, the higher Reynolds number results in more gradual spatial changes for both pressure and velocity.
From these plots, there isn't a clear trend for the peak velocity at the vena contracta as dependent on Reynolds number. Downstream, centerline velocity approaches the expected Poiseuille value (\(2.0\)) for the low Reynolds number examples; turbulence causes the velocity profile to flatten with increasing Reynolds number resulting in a lower downstream centerline velocity in the examples.
The changes in the flow physics that occur with changing Reynolds number alter the effective orifice area, more specifically the quantitative relationship between physical stenosis area and the effective area. The literature uniformly indicates that the effective area increases with increasing Reynolds number with greater dependence on Reynolds number for relatively mild stenoses. The effective area cannot, however, be any larger than the physical area. The point is that "flow dependence" is an expected aspect of stenosis flow that need not have anything to do with changing physical stenosis area. For the lowest Reynolds number example here (Re = 25), a non-negligible component of the pressure gradient is due to energy lost to friction as evidenced by a significantly greater pressure gradient despite a similar value for \(u\) at the vena contracta. This would be a case where the SBE can't be applied accurately since it assumes negligible losses along the centerline up to the vena contracta.Healthy Habits To Avoid Stress Fundamentals Explained

This has been an issue I’ve been pondering as of late, ever since the revelation that Killzone: Shadow Fall was to be 50GB on the PlayStation Store. Then just yesterday, we learned that the Xbox One’s Dead Rising 3 would be getting a patch that is a massive 13GB in size, and that pretty much set me on this course to write about my thoughts on the subject.
The first obvious issue of course is that of downloading. I won’t be spending too much time on this, because we in South Africa are the victims of this far more than internationals. You bastards with your insanely high speed internet. I always felt that this was the generation that gamers in my country were going to start getting left behind, because our fastest speed right now is a 10MB connection, whereas we still offer speeds slower than 1MB. Unfortunately, making over 10GB downloads regularly is not feasible on those kinds of connections, and furthermore we still have capped internet on, I’m not saying that internationals, despite their fast internet speeds, aren’t facing this problem as well, because there is firstly still the matter of large numbers of people downloading massive files at once from a server, and secondly there is the problem I actually want to talk about today, which is the matter of hard drive space and game installations.
Before I go into that, an important detour needs to be made. Those with reasonable knowledge of games would know that a game’s size isn’t made up purely of the game itself. You wouldn’t think it, but non-essential content like the extra languages and that are actually a huge chunk of the total size.
That is why if you’ve ever looked at some game torrents (naughty!), you’d see that “Black Box” editions of games, which are basically games that have all unnecessary content ripped out of them to reduce the size, are drastically smaller than the full editions. For example, games that are over 15GB in size, could have Black Box editions that are less than 10GB. While Black Boxes were usually some people’s saviours, it now seems that even they are being put to the test as the recent Battlefield 4, for example, is over 20GB, and its Black Box is 16GB. However, on the other hand, Need for Speed: Rivals was 8GB, and its Black Box was somewhere around 3GB in size.
Keep in mind that this is all before the games are actually unpacked and installed, and this is simply referencing their download sizes give or take a few. As if you were downloading them from Steam or PlayStation Network or Xbox Live.
Now with games this large, it immediately becomes a problem for digital-only. Our new consoles have started out with hard drives that are 500GB in size, although that’s not necessarily true because of the OS space and such, and most of us know that you never really get the full capacity of any hard drive. That means with the PS4 we’re getting a borderline acceptable 407GB and the Xbox One is giving us a lowly 362GB, which is worrying. Both of those figures can easily be verified through Google.
Initially, my first thought when contemplating my lovely PlayStation 4’s hard drive was that I didn’t mind too much because games install ridiculously quickly. Seriously, all of them so far took less than a minute after inserting the disc to become playable, so surely deleting games and re-installing them can’t be such a train smash? I mean, it’s naturally a bit on the crap side that you will need to delete games constantly to clean up space, and that’s just on PS4 where it’s quick. But it’s a worry on my beloved PC as well, and of course to anyone with an Xbox One. Well, that’s for disc-based games. The problem comes in with digital. While my Steam games are fair enough so far to manage, you can’t just easily re-download a 50GB game or so and get back playing as conveniently.
I’ve been contemplating the issue, and for one thing it might become better when newer models of our consoles are out that hopefully pack 1TB hard drives or more. But that’s a long-term aid, and it doesn’t help us here with 500GB consoles and increasing game sizes. Personally, I’m not really sentimental about my games and neither do I go for second playthroughs unless it’s years later or the game was extremely good and begged for me to return. That’s why I can easily delete games and move on with my life. But that’s only me. I fully get how many gamers out there want to return for multiple playthroughs or keep their games if they’re always coming back to them.
On PC, you have access to easily usable external hard drives and game data back up features on Steam for instance to prevent having to re-download your games. But on console?
Sure enough, many would argue that it’s unrealistic that anyone would actually need to keep more than ten games on their hard drives, since no one really plays that many games at once, and it can’t hurt to re-download the smaller digital titles. That is a fair argument because sometimes people do tend to make an issue out of something that previously wasn’t really an issue. I mean, I’m sure many console gamers before had buckets of game data from past titles on their consoles but never went back to replay those games. I know I was guilty of that.
But an important question to ask is whether or not games will continue to grow in size, as these are just the launch titles. After a year, how large will some of the heavy-hitter titles be?
My next thought I will freely admit is a stretch of the imagination. But honestly, I am wondering whether aspects such as “replayability” will become even less of a thing for games over the course of this generation. Since now publishers possibly may not only be battling for gamers’ attention in short spaces of time, but also for their game to be played as much as possible before they literally become yesterday’s news. I mean, it would take a strong pull for someone to re-download a 25GB+ game after they’ve deleted it. Here I am also referring to those busy windows where we see maybe five to ten major titles release in a month.
It’s probably not even related, my above thought, and maybe it’s a bit silly but I’m putting it out there because I do anticipate that gaming and the industry are both going to undergo some drastic changes throughout this generation. If you read Alessandro’s very interesting piece recently, about the game industry potentially heading towards a crash, you might find that statement more believable. I’m sure many gamers have seen that things can’t go on the way that they have, it’s just not realistic this way.
So is the matter of games becoming too big a possible factor, even in a really small way, in what might eventually lead to changes in our gaming? Or do you feel that it’s a negligible issue, since there isn’t a good reason realistically to keep such big games on your hard drive throughout the year?
Personally, I am not too worried for myself, since I know what kind of gamer I am, but this is more reaching out to those who are seeing this as a potential problem. What are your thoughts on how to deal with it as of yet?

Calvary must precede the Ascension, and both must come before Pentecost. The glorified Lord was the text on which the Spirit was to discourse, and the text must be complete before the sermon can commence. Moreover, it was only when our Lord had ascended to the right hand of the Father, that He could receive or transmit the Divine Comforter. It was needful for Him to be by the right hand of God exalted, before He could ask for and receive, and shed forth the Holy Spirit of promise. The one Paraclete must finish His work, and be withdrawn, ere the other could come to take up and finish His work on earth. The Son must sit down on the throne, or the Spirit could not descend to sit on each of the disciples.
But there is a deep inner lesson for us all in these words. We sometimes wonder why we have not received the Spirit, and why our lives are not channels through which He pours in mighty rivers to make desert hearts and lives blossom and sing. How gladly would we part with all beside, if we might be conscious that not tiny streamlets, not one river of holy influence merely, but that rivers were issuing from us as the waters from the temple threshold!
Is not the reason to be sought in our neglect to glorify Christ? We have never yet abandoned ourselves to Him, content to live the branch-life, with no other aim than to realize the one purpose of His most blessed life, the glorifying of the Father. We have never seriously made it our life-purpose to glorify the Lord Jesus. There has been no triumphal entry into our hearts, no enthronization, no challenge to the gates of our soul that they should lift themselves up to admit the King of Glory.

However, sometimes the behavior of parents is called into question so severely that they risk losing custody on a permanent or temporary basis. When allegations of neglect surface, authority figures in Florida might decide a child is better off in protective custody than with either parent.
A recent incident in South Florida highlights the consequences that can occur when parents engage in behaviors considered neglectful. According to news reports, a couple entered a bar with a 3-month-old child, but the manager of the facility told the parents that children were not allowed. At that point, the parents took the baby outside and left it unattended on the sidewalk in the hours after midnight. The report indicates that the baby's mother went outside periodically to check on the child and would then come back inside to continue drinking.
When officials became involved, the child was removed from the care of the couple and is awaiting suitable custodial parents with the Department of Children and Families. Both of the baby's parents face possible charges associated with child neglect. The news report indicates the two are facing criminal litigation.
Most parents would probably not choose to leave their child outside of a bar in the wee hours of the night. While this incident is extreme, it does reveal the damage that can occur from possible negligent behavior. This is especially the case during child custody battles and other aspects of getting a divorce. Consulting carefully with a family law attorney can prepare you to handle all kinds of child custody issues.

Zenns also pulled down seven rebounds. After losing Jenna Einink and Ashton Albanesius to graduation, Chautauqua Lake coach Eric Schuster is hoping Zenns will be one of the players to step up offensively.
"Jesse played with us last year," he said. "As playoffs came along last year, she saw quite a bit of time. She should be a double-double almost every night she comes on the floor."
Chautauqua Lake held a slim 14-9 lead after the first quarter, but went on a 13-4 run in the second quarter for a comfortable 27-13 halftime lead. The home team went on to outscore the Lady Panthers, 17-7, in the third quarter to essentially put the game out of reach.
Taylor Phelps contributed in the win with an all-around solid performance with eight points, eight rebounds, seven steals and five assists.
Jamie Wilcox led Pine Valley with 11 points, six rebounds and four steals.
"The first quarter was close, but I thought we did a nice job getting to the rim," Schuster noted. "Our guards attacked the rim. I was really pleased with that."
The Lady Thunderbirds get back to action on Friday at the Jamestown Tip-Off Tournament.

ChiVision is a brand new Chicago-based production company composed of a group of Chicago homies with a vision. A vision to put the effort of a multiple day festival into one night. The company has been blowing up ever so quickly with much support from the Chicago scene because their events differ from the average.
“What’s so special about our events is we really care about our audience, appreciate everyone as much as they appreciate us, and we bring you REAL producers/djs with 100% original music. Always killers, never fillers.”
Undercoast, their first event and North Coast afterparty, was a complete success. Blankface, Bommer, Grime Theory, and other locals all came to hit the decks. The stride for quality over quantity separates ChiVision from the rest. The performers, attendees, and organizers are all one big family. These events are close knit and everybody knows everybody.
“Our crowd is like our family. In Chicago, you see a lot of familiar faces week in and week out. Even with Gobble Wobble only being our second show we have a strong following that loves what we do and the events that we put on.”
This past weekend, ChiVision teamed up with SoundFX for their second event, Gobble Wobble in Detroit, Michigan. Artists included Jantsen, Luzcid, MiKrodot, Bommer, ATLiens, and plenty more bass music.
“We have love for art and special talents people have, so if you can perform and show an audience something they’ve never seen, you would do well at our events. We’ve still got a long way to go, but the people that come to our shows give us so much love and that’s one of the biggest driving forces that gets us to do what we do.”
All areas of the efforts and talents are well recognized at their events. Food vendors and live art are just some of the installations you will find at any ChiVision event. With each event, ChiVision grows more and more and it definitely shows.
“The future looks bright. We are just getting started, but the way things have just been falling into place makes it feel like this was what we should have been doing the whole time. I am blessed with the success I’ve been seeing. Hennything is possible.”

We travelled by air. Our plane took off at Domodedovo Airport and landed at Heathrow Airport four hours later. My friends and I stayed at "Majestic” Hotel situated not far from Royal Albert Hall and Albert Memorial in Kensington Gardens.
I was happy to see the places I have read and told my students about for my whole life. Just imagine how many famous sights we have seen and how many world-known museums visited in and around London within our week trip: the City of London, the Houses of Parliament with Big Ben, St. Paul’s Cathedral, Westminster Abbey, Buckingham Palace, the British Museum, the National Gallery, Trafalgar Square, Piccadilly Circus, the Thames with London Bridge and Tower Bridge, London Eye, the Tower of London, Stonehenge and the town of Salisbury, Hampton Court Palace owned by Henry VIII, Royal Windsor Palace, Stratford-upon-Avon, Oxford, the town of Greenwich with the Royal Observatory.
My heart was sinking while I was walking along London streets, talking to Londeners, having lunch in the pubs. I wish you had an opportunity to travel to this wonderful country some time.
I enjoyed taking lots of pictures in London. You can see some of them in this article and 400 more photos - here.

(After that, they face each other and it's in God's hands)
Special thanks to Joe Castrucci, who's ETSY store is definitely worth checking out.

First Pro I witnessed at the park when I moved to HB(along with TimTim).The transworld check out was the first magazine I ever bought. He was also in the first 411 I ever bought(411 16). Always stoked to hear dude earned a college degree n even more stoked to see photos n clips of him nowadays(original tricks, spots). I would've never thought he would have the longevity that he has achieved at first but after his Adio part I was instantly a fan. Underrated but I'm sure he's not losing sleep over it. Keep doin what you're doin Montoya
Your practice methods really very nice..Its all look very nice to see...
Thanks for the heads up on the Castrucci store. Digging the prints.
411 16 was my first video purchase and I've been down for him ever since.
lol. Check out's funny with long hair. sw flip bs tail looks good and high. Mags were still using video grabs at that time?
I like that gallery shot.
He does have a weird bag of tricks that are not typical. Good stuff.
haha, his mum is killing it. I can't frontside heelflip!
The hair photo is pretty funny.
I haven't really paid much attention to him for several years (honestly, I was kind of bored with his tricks). And then I watched the ESPN vid and was floored. He really has evolved and threw down some incredibly innovative tricks. I will forever love Guy (ultimate legend status in my mind), but my vote is with Danny. Great part.

SPOILERS.
Joss Whedon has already said that he plans to introduce more women into Marvel's cinematic roster over the course of Phase Two, because 1) he's Joss Whedon and 2) women are severely under-represented on the cinematic superhero front. I remember reading an Entertainment Weekly interview with Whedon back when THE AVENGERS was first about to release, and he was asked why he kept writing strong female characters into his work. He responded with something along the lines of "because you have to keep asking me that question."
To which I grinned and thought "touche," because he is sadly right. But if today's rumor is true, the change he has spoken about enacting may already be well on its way to fruition. French actress Stephanie Szostak (THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA, R.I.P.D.) joined IRON MAN 3 a ways back, but her exact role was never specified. Since then, two "inside sources" have contributed to the rumor mill surrounding her presence, one source simply saying that "fans will go crazy" over who she is playing while the other outright stating that she is none other than Janet van Dyne, aka the woman who eventually becomes the Avenger known to readers as Wasp.
While I doubt we'd see Szostak in costume if this rumor turns out to be true, there are still plenty of movies left between IRON MAN 3 and THE AVENGERS 2 in 2015 in which we might see van Dyne become the true heroine fans of the comics know her to be. I'm thinking ANT-MAN specifically, as Henry Pym and van Dyne are connected on many levels and would provide a fascinating and human dynamic to the greater team relationship in AVENGERS 2. I'm seeing shades of SERENITY and "Firefly" here, and I like it. I like it a lot.
But what about you?
This is a still from the IRON MAN 3 trailer featuring Szostak and Downey Jr.
And this is a picture featuring Szostak by herself, because... because yeah.Is Apple’s China dream over as it bets on India manufacturing plan?
Apple seems to be growing more frustrated with the rising labour costs in China as it looks to slowly shift its manufacturing base from China to India.business Updated: Jan 25, 2017 20:04 IST
Apple seems to be growing frustrated with the rising labour costs in China as it looks to shift its manufacturing base to India.
“The iPhone-maker is betting big on India as it faces rising employment costs in China. Hence today they presented their manufacturing plan to the government,” a source said adding that the government is yet to take a decision on the issue.
However, the official said that the iPhone-maker was betting on India because of low-cost labour and has said that it wants to shift its manufacturing base despite China’s offer of bigger incentives.
Earlier, in an earnings call Cook has said that he was hopeful of turning around India into the next China for Apple. “Our iPhone sales in India were up over 50% in 2015-16 compared to the prior year, and we believe we’re just beginning to scratch the surface of this large and growing market opportunity.
“Looking ahead, we’re seeing some very exciting developments in India. Reliance Jio is rolling.”
Apple includes India in its Asia Pacific region, which reported $2.7 billion in sales during the quarter. iPhone sales in China, which slowed down 30% during the July-September quarter, have failed to make a mark in the company’s balance sheet lately.
Overall, the company’s sales declined 9% to $46.85 billion in the three months to September – the third consecutive quarterly fall. The sales fall hit the company’s quarterly profits, which came in at $9 billion - a 19% decline on the same period a year earlier. For the year to September 2016, the iPhone maker reported its first decline in annual sales and profit in 15 years. Net sales stood at $215.6 billion during the period under review, an 8% decrease on the record $233.7 billion of sales in the previous year. Profits declined 14% year-on-year to $45.7 billion during the period.
Apple is expecting India to plug the declining sales. “I think it’s clear that the population of India will exceed China sometime in probably the next decade or so, maybe less than that. If you sort of look at the number of people who are or will move into the middle class sort of over the next decade, and the age of the population… if you look at India, almost 50% of the population is under 25,” Cook said.
“There are enormous investments going in on 4G and we couldn’t be more excited about that because it really takes a great network working with iPhone to produce that great experience for people… I see a lot of the factors moving in the right direction there.”
In India, Apple has a long list of demands before it starts manufacturing. “Apple has been asking for a lot of sops that includes freight subsidy as the country has logistical issues, continuation of differential duty on mobile handsets and components manufacturing even when the GST regime comes in and income tax holiday in the country just as China or Vietnam offers,” an industry expert told HT, adding that “exports should be made a top priority by enhancing sops under merchandise exports from India scheme (MEIS) from 2% to 5%.”
A government official said that Apple wants the higher exemptions because “there are not many high-end phone-component makers in India to buy from.”
“The company will have to manufacture the components in India, and it has to meet international standards.”City to Soil

Please insert a valid email addressI don’t know when I got like this, but when it comes to pop culture – I don’t trust the masses.
And I haven’t for a long time.
If almost everyone I knew was saying so and so’s CD was the tightest thing out or such and such movie was the only one worth seeing this season, I almost automatically, yet unintentionally, blocked the likelihood of my even giving those projects a chance.
I don’t even think I had the power to control this myself. It’s like my media nonsense immune system has become so strong that it fights off viruses such as Soul Plane and much of the stuff that comes out of Atlanta without me even trying.
This is because years of looking at who’s on top of the music charts; the movie lists; and even the bestselling books lists (Supahead, anyone?!) makes me believe that the masses lack substance in their choices.
So you’d be surprised to hear which sitcoms I’ve never seen; which songs I’ve never heard; and which amazing artists and movies I got put on to mad late because I didn’t given them a chance until well after their probationary period.
But all of this became null and void concerning the film American Gangster.
I had the chance to see the film more than two weeks ago at the National Association of Black Journalists Convention in Las Vegas (I know some of ya’ll are tired of hearing about my trip to Vegas. I promise this’ll probably be my last Vegas-related piece … I think).
No, I will not spoil the film for you, but I’ll just say it was amazing. Period.
And while reflecting on the film shortly after leaving the theatre, I couldn’t help but to think that it almost joined the list of media that I almost missed out on.
I had very little interest in seeing American Gangster until I knew I had the chance to see it for free. (Sidenote: I’m one of those people who is forced to reconsider lots of things when the word FREE is attached.) I saw the posters for the movie before I heard anyone talking about it and thought it might be interesting. But when I read the online hype and other whispers about the film, like always, I began to be turned off.
I even ignored multiple opportunities to see the trailer. I was just that comfortable in my “I probably won’t like it” philosophy.
Had NABJ not stepped in at the right time with the hookup, I don’t know if I would have ever had the chance to experience that fine moment in pop culture. Some might say, “You see? That’s why you can’t immediately dismiss popular demand!”
But I beg to differ. The examples where nonsense reigns supreme among the majority greatly outweigh the opposite.
Surely Common’s latest project “Finding Forever” recently debuting at number one – and furthermore India.Arie’s project doing the same months ago with far less promotion – is encouraging. But a quick look at the Billboard Hot 100 charts shows that “Crank Dat (Soulja Boy);” “Bartender” AND “A Baby Baby” are ALL in the top 10 this week.
Are you serious?!
How can I find a balance between keeping those with questionable reviewing skills on mute while making sure that I don’t miss out on the gems that seep through the cracks the pop gods leave open?

- Actor Dave PhillipsIdle threat of the week
The best kind of victim is a victim of his own success. Over the past year Idle Threat of the Week has morphed from a goof on a poorly trafficked website to a phenomena on par with the other great weekly awards, like National League Player of the Week or Cool Robot of the Week.
As result of Idle Threat's higher profile, celebrities, nation states and inanimate objects have become more careful about issuing idle threats. This cautiousness especially pertains to Sundays, which is the day the panel -- who are usually unprepared for their duties -- meet to determine the winner.
The panel has responded to this new prudence by stretching the definition of idle and threat to realms the words have not previously visited.
Of course we are always on the look out for a clear cut idle threat -- it makes our jobs so much easier, and we don't have to go to bed at night with visions of violent battles against the English language.
That in mind, the panel was giddy when we opened yesterday's Washington Post to find a op-ed piece in which a pair of Vermonters threaten to pull the Green Mountain State from the union it has been a part of since 1791.
Our excitement was tempered when we noticed the date on the upper corner of the page: April 1rst.
But part of the farce of the article was the tone wasn't farcical at all. And when we googled the names of the authors we found they had both had made this same threat in previous years -- on days which were not April 1st.
There are too many reasons to list here that a Vermont secession is ridiculous to list here. So we will just point out that, unlike its neighboring New England states, Vermont receives more money from the federal government than it pays the federal government in taxes.
Vermonters are free to drive around in their beat-up old pick up trucks, getting fat off maple syrup and the government dole, until the rest of America switches to soy milk.
Then we just might cast burdensome Vermont off -- to enter into some some bitter multi-lingual cheese racket with the Québécois to its north.
Vermont might not contribute much to America on most weeks, but on this, the week March 26th to April 1rst, it shines as Idle Threat of the Week.
In the truest sense of the words.Meeting new people can provide a plethora of inspiration especially when they bring a new perspective to a city and industry I have grown to love! Last week I had the chance to sit down with Victoria Cates, a Couture artist who recently moved to St. Louis from the Big Apple. We talked city living in the Lou compared to New York and the pursuit of a dream job that has become an undervalued part of the fashion industry since the rise of fast fashion.
Kasper Woldtvedt: You just moved to St. Louis from New York in November, what were you up to in the Big Apple?
Victoria Cates: Essentially just trying to make ends meet. I grew up in the suburbs of New York so I decided to move back home after getting my degree from a small school in LA called The Academy of Couture Art. Even before graduating, I was offered an internship by Nicole Miller herself based on my portfolio, so moving back seemed like the best option for my career. After that internship ended, I attempted to play the corporate fashion game, until I realized just how impossible it would be for me to fit into the commercial “box” that everyone wanted me to fit into. Being a starving artist also wasn’t an option. After all, this ain’t New York in the 70’s! So despite the existential crisis, it seemed like the universe listened because I was quickly provided with what would become my absolute dream job. I became the associate designer of a couture-level accessories startup called Jankele. I was there for about 3 years developing techniques in embroidery that I never knew were even possible. To name a few, we created mohawks entirely out of amethyst and citrine crystals that stood on end, and sewed giant pyrite rocks with fishing line onto wired leather. We truly made magic happen there. Unfortunately, when something seems too good to be true, chances are it probably is. So the dream finally ended and reality set in. The company disbanded and I was left to my own devices. All I was armed with was an undervalued, under appreciated old-world skill in a fast-paced city. At this point, I gave it a year to find work somehow related to what I’d been doing, but I soon realized the opportunities were few and far between – not to mention the unlivable wages. It didn’t take long for me to start resenting New York because of this. It definitely broke my heart to say the least.
KW: A background in couture, how in the world does one decide to pursue that?!
VC: I think it came from the combination of my lifelong love for art, mixed with my undeniable obsession with fashion – both of which were apparent from a young age. I always loved both and often wrestled with both for years at a time seeing which one would win, but they generally came out even. I think this is when I decided that Haute Couture was as close a marriage of the two as it could get.
KW: Why St. Louis?
VC: Well, I was really and truly suffering in NY. I knew I had to leave one way or another. All I wanted was to find a way to sustain my life by doing what I love and also being able to enjoy it. Is that so much to ask!? (haha) So, St. Louis first came onto my radar screen when my good friend Katy moved here from Brooklyn to open up her store, Living Collective, last year. She then hired my sister, who followed suit. It was really hard to see them go, but I also thought, “Hey, there must be something to this place. I’ve been hearing a lot of good things lately.” So I decided to help my sister move and see it for myself. Needless to say I fell in love. I was shocked by the cost of living and even more so by the amount of friendly, creative, interesting and even fashionable people! I felt like I’d discovered a hidden treasure.
KW: Is there anything you have noticed about the style in St. Louis compared to NY?
VC: Honestly, I judge style not so much on trendiness, but mostly on uniqueness. You find a lot more people sporting the latest trends on the streets of NY, which can almost seem like an endless runway at times. There’s the deception that these people are more stylish than others because they look “chic” and “put together”. The fact is that many of them worked a little too hard to look that way. I’m mostly attracted to those that tote their own unique style that isn’t forced and can’t be cited by anything obvious. I find that there’s a lot of that here in St. Louis because when fashion’s not constantly shoved in your face, you have to get creative. You have to find a way to make that weird vest you found at Goodwill with the dogs all over it look fresh and fun.
KW: After seeing your work in person, it is incredibly detailed. Tell me a little bit about your studio practice.
VC: The nice thing about my studio practice is that it doesn’t have to be in my studio. I can spend hours working on a piece from pretty much anywhere I want. My favorite things to do while I’m working are to marathon “watch” mindless TV shows or sit outside in the park with friends during the nicer months. I’d say the hardest part of what I do is the design process. That’s when I have to sit down and really concentrate on coming up with a concept, do the research, make a bunch of drafts and then come up with the final design to be embroidered. Most of the work is just patience. It’s probably the only thing in the world that I actually have patience for.
KW: What inspires you?
VC: Where to begin? Well, I love love love animals and everything about them. I love old architectural details and old houses. I love historical Americana and folk crafts. I’m very into classical things mixed with kitsch. I think a lot of my inspiration comes from the years I spent living in Salem, Massachusetts (of the Salem Witch Trials) and the strange sort of mystical romance surrounding such an awful time in history.
KW: How would you describe your style?
VC: That’s something I’ve always had trouble with. I think because it’s so eclectic. According to my boyfriend, it can be described as “adult baby” (haha). I wear a lot of babydoll dresses and oversized cardigans topped with berets or knit hats. I like whimsical things like animal-shaped pins, flower hair clips and antique fur stoles. Sometimes when it’s cold I do what I call my “confused grandmother” look, which is like a maxi dress with a bunch of knits layered over it and a giant fur cowl to top it off.
KW: We spoke about the nature of your work and the timeless quality of the artistry while also holding a functional purpose at times. I am curious about your thoughts on fast fashion and the direction of the industry from your perspective.
VC: I think there will always be a need for things to be made quickly, cheaply and disposable. The way the consumer is now, and will be in the future, will only want for that much more. My only hope is that we can eventually find a safe, sustainable way to do this because it cannot continue the way it’s going for much longer. I think it’s great what Hanger is doing because it’s an example of one of the ways that we can begin going about changing our blind consumption of fast fashion and becoming more conscious of how we spend our money on clothes. We weren’t raised as our grandparents were with the idea that each article of clothing in our closet is an investment and is to be cherished, mended and treated with care. We live in a time of excess. Not to say that either way is necessarily bad or good, but that we need to reach some sort of middle ground where quality is respected, even desired again, but choice and affordability aren’t compromised. I do what I do because it is a true labor of love. A labor that in some capacity will always be appreciated and sought after, especially in a time when it’s so scarce. I want to be a part of the effort to bring back these archaic crafts and expose them to the world again. So many people desire to own something special and personal, which the current fashion market cannot provide. I want to be that option for them. I want to help bring that bit of couture magic back into the world again.

The single most important investment decision you will ever make... and the Florida based company that holds the secret
My name is Hans Thomas and I'm inviting you to learn about the most interesting renewable energy concept ever introduced, Biomass!
Since 1900, global energy consumption has risen every, single year.
Let me repeat that......Since 1900 global energy consumption has RISEN EVERY SINGLE YEAR.
Energy has been the biggest, best game in town for over a century.
The floor of the New York Stock is filled with children. The floor of the Comex Exchange (energy) is where the big boys play. A wise man once said about the Golden Rule......he who has the gold...buys energy.
The most exclusive energy market in the world just opened its doors to the working guys...you and me:
To understand why this has happened, we first must enter a quaint office in Coconut Creek, Florida, the home of Clenergen Corp. Over the next several months this firm will change the way you make money and if you follow my suggestions carefully, you should be able to realize high double digit growth from this investment.
In this office lies a secret which will revolutionize the way the Biomass industry has operated for years.
This article is being written to tell you that the concepts forming at Clenergen and other industry leaders changes everything.
Yes, Everything!
The cost of everything, from transportation to real estate depends on knowing with the price of energy is in the near term future.
If you knew the price of energy in the near future you would control the market, but you don't. However, if I told you that knowing the price of energy is really more about understanding what the price of inputs are combined with the selling price of the output.
Companies throughout the energy industry are signing long term power purchase agreements to accomplish long term revenue goals...all without knowing the price of the input. This is a decades old practice and is foolish!
Have you ever heard of your local utility having to go back to the state's energy board and ask for a rate increase because “summer temperatures were unseasonably hot”? They knew what the outputs were, but miscalculated the inputs.
Throw out your time tested strategies, plans and hedges as the short term rotation crop location concept will open your eyes and will make you understand that companies like Clenergen are our energy future.
I have been right 86.7% for the past 13 years, a solid track record in selecting equities. This tiny piece of information on renewable energy has altered forever the direction of my life, has made me wealthy and made countless others wealthier.
I want to offer to you this compelling story click here to go to
Read This Carefully
The renewable energy market has gone global and firms like Clenergen Corp (CRGE) and Southern Company (SO) are leading the charge. As a result and if you act quickly the profit-opportunity of a lifetime awaits you.
Act Now!
On the very day Clenergen Corp fired up operations on their Biomass facility in Tamil Nandu, India, a coal fired plant in the same country was shuttered due to a lack of available feedstock. A hastily organized meeting by the United States department of Energy was called to ensure that US energy plants are not threatened by the same outcome; as the US energy network is dependent upon global production.
So from Tamil Nandu, India across the Russian tundra, through the Alaskan pipeline, over the rocky mountains and down to Costa Rica, one, seamless network running to and from provides the power the global energy market demands.
The result of short rotation crops being located at or near generation stations is changing an entire industry. In the beginning everyone tries to understand the concept, prices dip and finally a total shakeup of the energy equation, as traditional methods and solar, wind, nuclear, biomass and wind power are re-evaluated, re-priced and radically reorganized.
As the suits in Washington continue to create stricter rules on reducing the carbon footprint, renewable come to the surface and put a strain on traditional utilities.
Without a doubt the game has changed.
My prediction that Clenergen would increase in price over 100% in 3 months was wrong, instead it took just 2 weeks.
September 25, 2010 $.49 - October 10, 2010 $1.13
Most investors will be late to the show and will not make the huge returns, will likely talk about how close they were to landing the big fish and lose out.

..since Clenergen, among others have promoted projects totaling 1000s of mw/H in the Biomass sector.
And participation in this opportunity is available to you today.
But, The Prospect Is Even Better as the Windfall Lies with the Smaller Companies
Huge profits in the months ahead are reserved for smaller companies that can control costs.
It is all absolutely FREE and available with a simple click.
Big energy companies are in trouble
In the showdown between Biomass and coal, BIOMASS is the big winner in Washington's new legislation on carbon emissions.
Clenergen is in the forefront and should capture huge profits in the near term.
Why electricity is the lead form of energy delivery and use.
Why countries like India and the Philippines are dominant in the Biomass industry and what has changed the outlook for the United States. Don't miss this!
My goal for you is simple....to provide you with enough information to make you wealthy, REALLY WEALTHY. I have enjoyed successes well beyond my imagination all from analysis of good information. I have had the opportunity to eat lunch with gentlemen like Dan Devos and Herb Brooks, partnered with NFL football and NBA basketball players and currently am advising the Omani government on restructuring their oil distribution portfolio to prepare for a surge in renewable generation.
As the price of energy stocks fluctuates, information from the report will allow you to identify divergences between energy stocks and when to enter and exit positions. I talk about trading strategies and feature a renewable energy company each and every issue.
I think you will agree the Global Renewable Energy Report is a necessity when making stock selections.
Take care for now!

Students can explore interests out of their comfort zones across the world, but sometimes the best and most fulfilling endeavors can be found much closer to home. Inspired by their own family histories, various groups of students dedicated their 2015 Winter Study to exploring their own backgrounds and those of the student body.
What started off as a mere conversation about mothers amongst close friends Meghana Vunnamadala ’16 and Niharika Pendurthi ’15 snowballed into a project to which they dedicated over a month. “We came up with the idea of The Mom Project one day in the fall, when we were just sitting around talking about our moms,” said Vunnamadala. Inspired by her own mother’s stories, Vunnamadala had always wanted to write her mother’s biography herself, but had never imagined completing such a feat over a course of a month.
“Niha said, ‘What if we did something now, over Winter Study?’ That’s how we came up with the idea of paying homage to motherhood by interviewing people about their mothers,” said Vunnamadala. The pair formulated The Mom Project as their own Winter Study 99 and sought to share the incredible stories of family members of this campus community. Hoping to express the “complexity of motherhood,” Vunnamadala and Pendurthi wanted to bring insight to the importance of motherly and maternal figures presents in our lives. “A lot of mothers who don’t work outside of the household say ‘oh, I’m just a mom.’ Yet, whether you’re a working mother or not, being a mom is one of the toughest jobs a person can have. We wanted to honor the work that mothers do and illuminate some of the reasons why being a mother is important,” said Vunnamadala.
After documenting their own mothers’ stories, the pair began the second part of The Mom Project, entreating fellow students across graduating classes to share stories as well. One of Vunnamadala’s favorite moments was “when one of the people we interviewed talked about how he pushed his mom, who had been diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis when she was 13, to hike up a mountain in Scotland. He said that she cried when she made it to the top because she didn’t believe that she could actually do it and she was so happy that she did. It was a really beautiful story.”
As Vunnamadala and Pendurthi finalize their final copy of the book, to be displayed to the public in Stetson-Sawyer Library within the next week, they cannot feel more accomplished of their work. “Being the children of immigrants, it was important to showcase the stories of immigrant mothers and the commonalities many of them share. I haven’t told my mom about the book yet, I’m going to mail her a copy later this month with a little note attached. I hope she’ll like it,” said Vunnamadala.
Similarly inspired by his own relative’s story, Matija Budisin ’15 formulated a 99 project in consisting of translating his great-grandfather’s autobiography from German into English. In the autobiography, Budisin’s great-grandfather recounts, in a lively narrative interspersed with brief historical expositions, his experiences during the Nazi and Communist eras in former Yugoslavia. During this time, he was falsely denounced and all of his property was expropriated. “It’s a book that has been lying on my shelf for years, and I finally began the work in earnest last summer. I took the opportunity to continue this Winter Study,” said Budisin.
“In the early 20th century, my grandfather’s father had started a food-exporting business in the Austro-Hungarian province of Backa. My great-grandfather inherited the thriving business and during WWII, the Nazi regime accused him of being a Jew – arresting, interrogating and torturing him,” said Budsin. The text delves into his great-grandfather’s exploits in the resistance and into the further interrogations and arrestments he endured in Communist Yugoslavia. “By 1961 he was finally able to leave Yugoslavia and return to Germany, where he eventually began working on his autobiography and published it in 1979,” said Budisin.
Enveloped in the exciting story of his grandfather’s life, Budisin was inspired to pursue the daunting task if only to share it with the rest of the world. “My great-grandfather appended a subtitle, ‘a contribution to modern history,’ prompting me to note that this book is a primary source document whose potential to serve as a case study for 20th century European history should be explored,” said Budisin.
Through the inspiration of their origins and family history, these students were able to create stories to share across campus, and continue to share with the rest of the world.
Texas Gunman Attacks Austin PD, Shoots Up Mexican Consulate and Tries to Burn it Down
A man being described as a middle-aged white male opened fire early Friday morning on the Austin Police Department (APD) Headquarters. After firing about 100 rounds, the gunman was killed. It is not known for certain whether he died from a police bullet or from a self-inflicted shot. The man also fired at other government buildings in Austin along with the Mexican Consulate. While at the Mexican Consulate, he attempted to set a blaze using several propane cylinders.

At about 2:20 a.m. Friday morning, the gunman began his shooting rampage. He shot rounds at the Mexican Consulate and attempted to set it on fire using propane canisters according to a report in USAToday. He then proceeded to fire shots at the U.S. Courthouse Building in Austin while in route to the Austin Police Headquarters. Other buildings were fired at along the way.
The fire at the Mexican was extinguished but was extensively damaged. No one has been reported injured at this time.
Some of the building shot at were near the popular 6th Street club district in Austin. The clubs close at 2 a.m. shortly before the shooting escapade began.
According to Austin Police Chief Art Acevedo, an APD mounted patrol sergeant shot the gunman with one hand while holding two horses with the other. The man was described as being about 50-years-old according to an article in TheState.com. It is not known at this time, if the sergeant’s shot killed the suspect or if he took his own life.
Officers discovered more propane cylinders in his vehicle. The suspect was also wearing a bulky vest. Not sure if he may have been wired with explosives, officers backed away and the Austin Bomb Squad was called. They determined there were no explosive devices.
Chief Acevedo did not reveal the suspect’s name at this time but said he had a criminal record. Police Tactical Teams responded shortly thereafter to an apartment complex where the gunman lived as a precaution. Some of the neighbors near the gunman’s apartment were evacuated for safety purposes. One neighbor, Adam Peyton told TheState.com he awoke to the sight of SWAT officer and vehicles in his neighborhood. The apartments are located near Zilker Park. He said it is a very close community. “As soon as they show his face, we’ll instantly know,” Peyton said.
Acevedo began to fuel speculation about the shooters potential motive according to theUSAToday article cited above. Stating the suspect’s targets indicated that he might have had anti-government motives linked to immigration. “If you look at the targets,” Acevedo stated, “it doesn’t take a genius that this is the potential. I would venture that political rhetoric might have fed into some of this, but that is speculation on my part.”

BEIRUT - Syrian forces loyal to President BasharAssad have destroyed several trucks carrying crude oil being smuggled from eastern oil fields to Turkey, state television said on Wednesday.It said the tankers were being taken from Tayem oil field, which rebel sources said earlier this month was partly under the control of rebel forces.Syrian television did not say exactly where the tankers had been hit, but said "terrorists" smuggling the consignment had been killed in the attack.Crude from the Tayem field, close to the eastern city of Deir al-Zor, had until recently been shared between rebels and government forces, the sources said.

The Walkman provided the first mobile way to have a truly personal listening experience. The combination of a small package, headphones and lightweight cassette tapes allowed people to take their music (and audio) everywhere, and tune out the world around them.
And the recording industry took notice. A wider variety of music became available, and producers of educational materials created more and more audio learning materials (including lectures, “books on tape” and more) to feed the hunger of the Walkman.
With such a powerful and game changing tool, one would think that all of these factors and innovations would lead to better communication, but 34 years later, one could argue that less true communication is happening than ever. While it isn’t the “fault” of Sony and its Walkman, there are factors that point to tools like it contributing to the demise of communication effectiveness.
People can’t listen if they are somewhere else. I am reminded of this often as I drive with my children (14 and 21) in the back seat of the car. I can talk to them. They are physically there, but communication can’t happen because the ear buds/headphones in their ears mean they are really somewhere else. This of course isn’t a phenomenon of just my kids – but of our culture. Just because people are in the room, doesn’t mean they are listening; yet often we assume they are. “I don’t understand, I told them in the meeting,” is the siren song for passing the communication responsibility off to the listener – and we know it doesn’t work that way.
People are more distracted – and less able to focus than ever. Because of the awesome tools at our disposal, we have more things to be distracted by than ever, but this point goes far beyond that. Because we are so used to putting things in our ears to listen to – we have more trouble than ever focusing when our ears are open. The headphones take us away with the music or message, but without them we are subjected to the cacophony around us, and we are less skilled at focusing on one message at a time.
Just because it is recorded, doesn’t mean people will listen (or understand). Speakers, trainers and educational providers thought the Walkman was the ticket to increased learning. Then they thought the same with the CD, and the MP3 player. Just because you create the message, doesn’t mean people will hear the message – even if they buy it, and even if they hit the play button.
The audio recording isn’t the full communication anyway. The Walkman gave easy access to audio communication anywhere, yet audio alone limits our ability to communicate. We all know that it is easier to communicate face to face than over the phone – the spoken word alone doesn’t always communicate our message. The Walkman seduced us to thinking that a recording would do it all for us – and the remnants of that belief are everywhere.
One way communication is limited. This is an obvious statement, and the Walkman wasn’t designed to create two way conversations, yet because it so powerfully and easily impacted one-way communication, we sometimes forgot this (very) important point. Which leads to the next point . . .
Asynchronous communication is more limited than we realize. We live in a world with so many tools for communication – many of them that separate the time and space between a message being sent and a message being received. While these tools are very helpful to us in many ways, we often live with the mirage that communication has occurred. Don’t believe me? How often have you said, or heard things like: “I sent them the email” or “Everyone just needs to watch the video we produced” or “I texted them”? Asynchronous, all.
….
While this post may seem cynical so far, all of these facts can be turned around individually if not culturally. If you want to be a more effective communicator, read on . . .
It all starts with something we all know, but too often, as proven by our actions, we forget.
True communication isn’t (just) about sending a message – however well prepared and carefully crafted. True communication doesn’t happen in a vacuum – it requires engagement in some way by the receiver. True communication is message sent, and message received.
The Walkman gave us a tool for sending and receiving, but we gave it and its electronic cousins too much credit and got lazy in our communication.
The best thing you can do as a communicator is focus on getting your message received. Check for understanding more often. Ask more questions. Focus on how you can engage the listener at a deeper level. Make the communication relevant and meaningful to them. Doing those things will make all the difference.
Put on your iPod (the Walkman’s great granddaughter), listen to some soft music and think about how you can become a more effective communicator. Then take out your ear buds and practice your “message received” skills – because message sent isn’t enough.Lorrie is a visual artist and designer based in Chichester. Lorrie specialises in painting, illustration and photography. Her influences range from the Renaissance, Baroque and Romantic, to the Post Modernist, and she is deeply influenced by the iconography and art of the Celtic La Tene period.
Her work embodies a diverse and eclectic flavour and Lorrie’s keen eye for colour, form and symmetry, mainly abstract in nature, is easily recognisable. Recent work has incorporated the themes of nature and has been inspired by the sea, oceans and the flora and fauna contained within.
Lorrie has a solo show entitled ‘Against the Tide’ in June at the Oxmarket Centre of Arts, Chichester, before exhibiting at Chichester Copywriter’s Writers’ Retreat, Cobnor in August.
Additionally, Lorrie is editor of Chichester Creative Network magazine,.

Very cool!!
A future gymnist, for sure!
great pics. Loves J.Here are a few basic tips before you put yourself in front of the public:
- Register your own domain. Those with @aol.com email and website addresses look like neanderthals.
- Don’t use a stupid domain like @goodforfamiles.com or @justiceforall.com. Use some form of your name (e.g., @keithberner.com or @keithforcouncil.com). This looks professional and allows you to tell your story in the content of your communications. When you try to squeeze your philosophy into your email address, you end up being a one-note candidate or (worse) appearing to be nothing more than a slogan. (And, unless you are a professional copywriter, your slogan is almost guaranteed to be corny or vapid.)
- Put up a website. If you are running for any office higher than small-town city council, put yourself where most people will look for you.
- Make sure your website is findable through popular search engines. Like a tree falling in a forest, a site that can’t be found makes no noise.
- Put your contact information, especially your email address on your website. Don’t make me have to choose between donate-now and volunteer buttons as the only way to send you an inquiry.
- Don’t ignore inquiries. If you can’t be bothered to respond to interested parties now, we know how bad your eventual constituent service will be.
- If you can afford it, hire professionals to create your brand, both visual and written. If you can’t afford it, use the best quality images and writing you can find.
What prompts this outburst from yours truly? Well, I am currently trying to gather contact information for ~130 candidates in Montgomery County so that endorsement questionnaires can be sent to them. It amazes me how many of them have no website or have sites that provide no means to reach them without giving them money or volunteer time. I also am aghast at the ~40% who have simply ignored my inquiries.
Get with it, people. Or get out of the race.
©2018 Keith BernerAround here, the local radio station often offers an all-'80s weekend. If I can get past the idea that my music is now considered retro, I can have a lot of fun listening to the old songs from high school and college. Remember "Come on Eileen"?
Anyhow, I'm driving along, humming to "Come on Eileen," and the theme song from "St. Elmo's Fire" came on. "St. Elmo's Fire," the movie that launched the Brat Pack. We were still in high school when we watched the likes of Rob Lowe, Judd Nelson and Demi Moore embark on their grown up lives. It seemed so glamorous. The possibilities of adulthood were endless. Soon we'd be out on our own, making undoubtedly large sums of money to support a high partying lifestyle. The best years were yet to come.
I wondered, as I hummed along, when we stopped looking forward and started looking backwards. When did we start longing for the optimism of our 20-something selves, or at least the waistline and skin tone? When were those best years? How did we let them go by so quickly? When did the fun optimism get replaced by the mundane chores of living, of paying bills, raising kids, making a marriage work?
Later on that evening, I hung out at our neighborhood block party, listening to an incredibly awesome band playing, literally, in my neighbor's garage. It was 10 p.m., the agreed upon curfew for the party and our community, but we asked them to play one more. Just one more song. The band fired up their instruments and gave us Prince's "Let's Go Crazy."
Those college memories came flooding back. I was 18 again, wearing cheap Kmart clothes, hoping to fit in with my college peers who probably never shopped at Kmart in their lives. I was on the dance floor at some snobby fraternity house – sorry Sigma Chi alums – dancing with my girlfriends, wondering if we were going to be noticed, whether our dancing was cool or clunky, how our hair looked, how our makeup was holding up, whether that cute guy in the corner was going to ask us to dance or find someone more beautiful. And if not, would we have to go back to the dorm and listen to the pretty and popular girls talk about their much more successful nights, as we pretended to be happy for them.
Contrast that to my 44-year-old self, who slipped off my Walmart $2 flip flops so I wouldn't trip when I danced. I was surrounded by friends and neighbors who didn't care if I could dance, didn't care what my hair looked like, didn't care where my clothes were from. I knew I'd see these people tomorrow, and we'd laugh about what a great time we had. I leaned against my husband, who's every bit as cute as those circa 1984 Sigma Chis. The band gave us the music from our youth, and we danced.
And I started to realize that those great years – which were a lot of fun – were also fraught with insecurities and limitations. With age, you come to realize how little certain things matter, and how lucky you are to have what you have. You dance because you want to dance, not because you want to attract attention, or look good, or fit in. Life gives us the freedom to dance, and there's no looking back.Get all your old film transfered we do it professionally!

SE 415<<It’s certainly not easy being green. Voice of Kermit the Frog, Steve Whitmire, has been relieved of his voicing duties. After 27 years of voicing the iconic amphibian, Kermit is getting a new voice in the form of Matt Vogel.
Whitmire had been voicing Kermit since Jim Henson’s passing in 1990, and had worked for “The Muppets” since 1978. Originally, no reason was given for Whitmire’s departure, but the actor has since spoken out, revealing he was “devastated” after being fired by Disney’s Muppet Studio.
Whitmire composed a blog post explaining that he would never consider abandoning Kermit, and that he was fired over the phone with the studio citing that they were recasting..
He also stated that he’d never “forsake the assignment entrusted to me by Jim Henson, my friend and mentor, but even more, my hero”.
Vogel’s Kermit will be debuted next week in a “Muppets Thought of the Week” video. He’s also worked as Kermit imitator Constantine in “Muppets Most Wanted”.
The Muppets Studio have diplomatically replied in a statement with: “The Muppets Studio thanks Steve for his tremendous contributions to Kermit the Frog and The Muppets franchise. We wish him well in his future endeavors.”

She inspired my first mini skirt in 8th grade (or was it 7th?), she introduced me to the Go-Go's, she patiently went over, and over, and over the cheer routine with me knowing full well that I just wasn't going to get it. She's seen me heart broken, in love, mad, sad and glad. She's given me a truckful of helpful advice including the nudge to keep blogging through and around the stuff going on in my life. I love this woman! Thanks for being there all these years and showing me what it means to have a friend for life.
But alas the award comes with strings attached...The rules are as follows:
List 5 obsessions that I have and then tag 5 other people. (who comes up with this stuff?)
5 of my obsessions are:
1. Red Bull- (is it ok to start off with that?) Now I'm feeling guilty, maybe I should put "Raising my children to be happy, healthy, productive citizens." hmmm, even typing that felt wrong, it's definitely got to be Red Bull.
2. Sexual health- (that sounds creepy but so does Red Bull as #1 over everything else) my job as a sex educator is a passion of mine. My goal? Educate WOMEN about their bodies, make them laugh and give them an excuse to have a glass of wine while giggling with girlfriends, all in a setting that will have their parnters PUSHING them out the door.
3. Reading- anything really, I love to read and learn. I mostly read the internet, but I just tell people it's like reading a book. I read a TON of blogs (I'm better at doing that than keeping up with my OWN blog)
4. Facebook- me lovey some Facebooking, just a week ago I got back in touch with one of my besties from High School. oh did that girl make me laugh!
5. Cleaning- you read it right, cleaning. Anyone who knows me IRL is now choking on their coffee. That is a big fat lie, just ask my husband he'll tell you! I want to say exercise, but it isn't quite an obsession yet, but I'm working on it!
1. I am going to double tag Serenity Now - is that breaking some super secret bloggers rule? I started reading her when she was doing her 365 posts. She must have worn herself out she just doesn't post as much any more.
2. My Frugal Adventures (damn, I should have made HER one of my obsessions!) This woman is a TRUE gift in my life. I am learning the art of coupons, saving and having fun while doing it. Charlene puts an incredible amount of time and effort into her posts and I SO love her for it!
3. Mountain Momma Musings - this woman can write, she's funny and I think from reading about how she doesn't make her bed, she and I might get along VERY well (although for the record I DO make my bed, I just don't finish cleaning out the crockpot after making chili until there is mold floating on top of the water, but I digress)
4. Classy & Fabulous - the name says it all don't you think? What it doesn't tell you is that this young lady (uggghhh I'm OLD) is a great writer, sassy and just plain darling. I love reading her posts they make me feel as young as I am in my brain! I figured she needed a fabulous award for her fabulous blog!
5. The McMommy Chronicles - she's a blogger star, but her posts make me laugh or smile so she gets my award!
Thanks, Kel. I'm sitting here crying. I needed those kind words today! Love ya, sister!
Oh, and Steph had BETTER blog this! Do you hear me Steph? Get to it, girl!
Congratulations! HeadlessMom is a IML friend of mine too. Isn't she sweet?

Residents of Gastonia's historic Highland community have been buzzing for some time about what's going up at the corner of Highland Street and Rankin Avenue. On Thursday morning, they got their first official glimpse of it when the Highland Mini Mart held its grand opening.
Situated on about half an acre at 226 N. Highland St., the small market occupies more than 2,000 square feet of what was most recently an abandoned building, but decades ago served as a sort of general store. It has undergone an extensive renovation in preparation for the new venture, said co-owner Patrick Naik.
"This is going to be more than just a convenience store," he said. "We will have groceries like a typical mini mart has. We saw this is a big neighborhood without any food or grocery stores nearby, and (residents) need a place where they can walk by and get some items."
Naik currently operates a convenience and fireworks store in Clover, South Carolina, while his partner, Manoj Patel, works for a security company in Charlotte. The two formed Kabab Express LLC and acquired the piece of local real estate in a treasury auction a year ago. They had been looking for opportunities to open a store like this in Gastonia, Naik said.
"We've seen a lot of development lately here and we saw they're going to have a big baseball field not too far away," he said, referring to the city's vision for creating the Franklin Urban Sports and Entertainment District south of nearby Airline Avenue.
Built in 1970, the structure that was on the corner there needed a lot of upgrades, Naik said.
"We've been working on it for the last six months," he said. "We put in new wiring, new plumbing, new HVAC, new flooring and a new ceiling."
The store will include dairy products, cereals, a few fresh meats, and other nominal grocery items.
Naik said they have also devoted about 500 square feet of space alone to the kitchen. From there, they'll be preparing hot food every day such as pizza, chicken tenders, and Southern staples such as green beans, mashed potatoes and gravy, chicken livers and gizzards. In the morning, they'll have fresh breakfast biscuits for sale, topped with standards such as bacon and sausage.
The kitchen will also serve as the home of an official Chester's Chicken franchise.
"This will be the first one in Gaston County," Naik said.
Flags with the Chester's Chicken logo flying outside are one reason passers-by have been poking their heads inside the building over the past week or so. Naik said he and his employees in training have already been giving away free samples to patrons, to spur interest in what's on the way.
"People have been coming in every day and asking when we're going to open," he said.
Naik said Highland Mini Mart will be open 6:30 a.m. to 10 p.m. Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. Saturday, and 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. Sunday.

Have Fun with Metric Weight Conversion
When you realize that you’re going to be traveling to a country that uses the metric system for determining weight, panicking is normal. The good news is that the metric system isn’t nearly as difficult to work with as you might think.
Even though knowing a kilogram is the standard unit of weight and that one kilogram is equal to 2.2 pounds is important, you don’t have to be a whiz at math just to enjoy your trip. You won’t have to carry a calculator around in your pocket so that you can decide how many stones you weigh when someone happens to ask. The only time you really need to know much about metric tons is if you happen to be shipping something very large.
The reason you don’t have to be an expert when it comes to converting ounces to grams, or even keep a copy of a conversion table in your pocket, is because there’s an online conversion website that will do it for you.
Prior to the website and the metric to American converter, trying to learn how to calculate units of weight into metric weights was extremely difficult. Not only did you need to have a solid understanding about how much a single centigram and milligram is, but you also had to be skilled enough in math to calculate the difference, and let’s face it, most of us aren’t that great when it comes to arithmetic.
The way that the online conversion website works is that you have a particular unit of weight, say 25 pounds, and you need to know what it is in kilograms. All you have to do is open the site up and type in 25 pounds. A split second later you will have your answer, 11.34 kilograms. You will be able to do this with any type of weight unit you desire. You can also use the online converter to help you determine how many milligrams is in a kilogram,1,000,000.
The really great thing about book marking the address of the weight conversion site is that you can use it to impress your friends. All you have to do is ask them their weight. Once you’ve been given the numbers, all you have to do is plug the number into the converter and a second later you’ll know exactly how many kilograms they weigh. Take the time to convert the number into stones and your friends will start to think you’re a genius. They’ll never have to know that you’re using a website. The more you do this kind of thing to convert the weight of something from American measurement and into metric, and then into a different form of metric weight, the more impressed your friends will be.

Making the Connection: Cordless Phones Get Smart
Manufacturers are working to integrate cordless phones better with your smartphone and household appliances. That means that the price on basic cordless phones continues to drop, but the few competitors that remain in the market keep the connected models pricey.
Masterfile
Smartphones are ubiquitous, and landlines face talk of extinction, so you could be forgiven for thinking that the days of the cordless phone might be numbered. However, manufacturers of cordless phones aren’t calling it quits and are shifting focus to other areas of the consumer-electronics market.
“Smartphones are great,” says Brad Pittmon of VTech, which also makes AT&T-branded phones, “but they don’t do one thing perfectly.”
Six experts with whom we spoke agree that the thing that cordless phones do perfectly—or at least better than cellphones do—is provide better call quality.
Nevertheless, manufacturers want to tie the cordless phone better to other means of communication that are in the household, particularly your smartphone. Beyond USB charging stations that can be found on the base unit of the latest cordless phones, manufacturers now enable connectivity that goes beyond simply letting you receive smartphone calls on your cordless phone. You now can be alerted to incoming text messages via your cordless phone, block calls to your smartphone (and cordless phone) and even run Google Android to surf the Internet.
Despite these advancements, Nadra Maxwell of RCA says the shelf space for cordless phones at retailers is dwindling. The good news is that you can buy a basic cordless phone that delivers interference-free Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications, or DECT, technology and a range of up to 500 feet for as little as $14.95. (Three years ago, you had to pay at least $19.99 for an entry-level cordless phone that had a comparable range.) Cordless phones that provide connectivity to other devices, however, cost $100 more than do basic models, and manufacturers tell us that connected models will remain high-priced.
SOLDIER ON. According to market-research company The NPD Group, sales of cordless phones slipped to 11.4 million in 2013, which represents an 18 percent decrease from 2011. Following that trend, Pittmon tells Consumers Digest that VTech’s sales dropped by 17 percent since 2011. Although they didn’t provide numbers, Panasonic and RCA also say their sales dropped during that time. (Uniden, which is the other main provider of cordless phones, didn’t respond to repeated calls.)
According to a Federal Communications Commission report from June 2013, 102 million landlines operated in the United States as of 2012, but that number is down 28 percent from 2008.
The movement away from landlines to cellphones appears to be a factor in AT&T’s July 2013 announcement that it would end landline service by 2020.
AT&T didn’t respond to our requests for comment, but John Bergmayer of Public Knowledge, which is a consumer advocacy group for the technology market, says consumers shouldn’t worry. Other landline options should be available even with AT&T out of the market, he tells Consumers Digest. Bergmayer says that in the next few years, companies also increasingly will provide other types of phone service for homes, such as fiber-optic or Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP).
Ross Rubin, who is a telecommunications analyst at consultancy Reticle Research, says that even if your cordless phone doesn’t have a built-in plug for VoIP connections, most service providers can supply an adapter. Also, if your service provider takes away your landline, you still can use a cordless phone through VoIP as long as you have Internet service. Should your Internet connection fail, that likely means that phone service also will be lost, but Rubin says “millions of consumers” find VoIP to be an acceptable alternative to landlines.
According to Chris Miller of IdoNotes, which is an independent online reviewer of electronics, the trade-off of switching to VoIP service from a landline now is performance. He says VoIP eats up a lot of bandwidth, so you might be subject to choppy or dropped calls. However, both Miller and Rubin say they expect bandwidth to improve in the next few years.

Chris - Stray EventsBack to news pageWhen saying retro, probably one of the first things that comes to our mind are the recollections of the past popular style images, which do have certain moments of comeback in our everyday life. The influence of the past decades in regards of the stylish options and interpretations we opt for is certainly noticeable in the looks. This is also true in case of the celebs’ looks, who occasionally turn to the 20s’, 40s’, or 50s’ styles for inspiration, and the modernized looks of theirs rising as a result of this impact are as a rule quite successful. Thus, here we have a brief list of retro style tips, which will get you into a small journey to the past, in order to find the key looks of the past decades of fashion changes.
Luxurious and Glittery Chic
The main fashion trends spanning around the 20s’ noted for the economic rise of the US, are quite popular with the extravagant and maximum shiny looks ladies opted for when choosing their everyday garments. One especially vivid exemplar of the looks of those times is illustrated with the images of the popular film “The Great Gatsby”, presented to the audience in 2013, in which the main actress Carey Mulligan can be found with looks exceptionally typical of those times. What makes them differ from the other decades’ options is the super sumptuous details accompanying the garments. They could be put as bows, draping designs, floral appliqués, and sumptuous fur elements. In addition, ladies picked some super luxurious and lavish jewelry for their party looks, in order to be ultimately blinding. The wide range of headwear accessories was also a remarkable part of their looks. So were the short haircuts like finger wavy bobs and pixies.
Let the Color Shine!
After this glitter-driven period, the color plays, especially frequent with bright shades became quite popular for the fashion trends. The war-centered 40s’ were especially popular with the bright and lively images, made of the signature pin up hairstyle for instance, accompanied by some ruffled and full shapes for dresses and skirts, and some bold décolleté shapes for tops, too. The images, however, never get even close to provocative and too daring. The hairstyle here as well, remains within the shapes of short or medium length, often curly or wavy, and also matching the bright makeup, made of arrows for the eyes, blinding classic shade of red for lips and rosy cheeks. Some hints of this style may be observed with the looks of popular singer Christina Aguilera, especially in case of the pin up hairstyle.
Let the Classic Chic In
Further in the 1950s, we can see a comparative comeback of the 20s’ principles to some extent, namely in case of the return of headwear details, which become integral parts of the ladies’ looks again. For this period the emergence of monochrome and bright color interpretations for garments may be seen, the complementary accessories for which were the gloves. The dresses and skirts encompassed ruffled, pleated, and straight shapes like tubes and pencils, generally cut at knee level. One of the most explicit embodiments of those times’ elegance is Dita Von Teese, who can be observed with more and more feminine, yet retro inspired looks, having all the descriptive elements of those times, at the same time not omitting the modern influence, either.
So here were some general retro styles and tips for the retro inspired looks of yours. This trend, like any other in the fashion world is capable of presenting you with flawless looks, in case of being implemented and matched correctly.

Anna Thew2000/01 35 mins colour 16mm double screen
The spirit of the London Film Co-op lives on in this multi-screen assemblage of 16mm diary reels and S8 blow ups dedicated to the delight and freedom of the old railway building in Gloucester Avenue, Camden...
with rapid rhythm single frames, calligraphic handheld camera, Warholesque portraits of Scorpio with his Paradjanov-like constructions, and painter friends, Steve and Peter on the Art of Cinema in their house of pure Merz in Brixton...
BROKEN PIECES II begins with uncut diary footage of the demolished Film Co-op building in Gloucester Avenue, in May and June 2000. The right screen was filmed one week before the left screen, which shows the old cinema wall filmed from the top of a digger. Superimposed in the Bolex over the second reel, are clips from avant-garde movies we saw there... from Lumiére to Deren to Fischinger to Genet, ending with Anne Rees-Mogg (diarist, film-maker and former 'L.F.M.C. Chairperson') and her film family, with Betty Boop refusing a false gem *...(* the LUX)
RAMBLAS RAMBLAS conjures the spirit of the eighties, using single frame, auto zoom and macro Super 8 blown up to 16m on the optical printer. A twin screen syncopation down the Ramblas ends in a whirling Sagrada Famiglia finale, to the dulcet vibrato of '40's Flamenco vocals by Juanito Varea.
MACHINE PARTS consists of four b/w optically printed S8 diary reels showing Steve Farrer and juggling friends on a Norfolk beach with his rotating camera the 'Machine' in slo mo and fast mo, followed by NOT NOZZE, printed to a dizzying stop frame/zoom in/zoom out recipe, from a nineties S8 colour reel of Franko's wedding, with glimpses of Chris Ofili, Reuben Murray and Ra's red hair. The classic soundtrack is from an eighties Network 21 pirate radio transmission by Anna Thew and Bruno de Florence with news of a harlot's arraignment for murder in 1536... n.b. inclusion of MACHINE PARTS, NOT NOZZE is optional.
N.Y/S. TATTOO- Steve Moore's L.O.V.E. tattoos and peach blossoms in Tuscany exchange skies with New York's skyline filmed from Isaac Julien's loft window and the streets of Manhattan, before 9/11 and before Martin was diagnosed. The sound is from S and Peter limbering up to talk on the Art of Cinema...
MARIO MONTAGE - underground star footage of Mario (broken teeth with hand coloured rose and mantilla) Montez, is optically re-filmed, slowed, speeded, freeze-framed and tinted so I could have two of him spinning longer... Mario overkill set to music pillaged from a twenties underground Japanese movie track.
16mm reels shot in the style of Super 8 - 2000:
SCORPIO, ex-lover of underground gallerist Lauren Maben, with his piercings and Paradjanov like constructions of bones and crystals, talks about Lauren's rough edge inspiration and fouled up funeral, from portraits of friends for the Drift. Complemented on the right screen with red flare outs, yellow autumn leaves, b/w fin de siècle Genovese tombs in Staglieno cemetery, Corsican boulders, sun bursts across the lens and a tropical moon.
Steve and Peter on the Art of Cinema
Warholesque dialogue runs with this reel of pure Merz,with Steve and Peter's collaged rooms in Brixton rapidly re-collaged in camera. Joe d'Alessandro and Samuel Beckett mix with Michelangelo's God creating Adam... and cross screens with waterfalls and dream rain forests.
Unwinding to the Argentinian composer Alejandro Viñao, "repetition, repetition. ... so you can hear the eye of the listener...", single frames of Palermo fruit mark the end of a Super 8 journey to Siracusa via Messina from SICILIA CANTAR.

"Anna T cuts the edge of dv dinge with a kaleidoscope of wide-screen projection…
Stars cut ups from Mario Montage and other colourfully optical printed films from Anna's cans, new 16mm takes of Scorpio: Paradjanov like constructions, of Steve Moore and Peter who inhabit a world of merz collage, and of film superimpositions over the bulldozed and abandoned London film-makers' co-operative in Gloucester Avenue - to the multiple screen delights and freedom of which building, these broken pieces are dedicated".(LUX flier 2000)So i decided to start up another tank after shutting down my FOWRL due to possibly moving house. My first tank was given to me by a friend which was 1200x600x450 which i had looking really nice until it crashed(Skimmer overflowed to waste and ATO kept filling fresh water) Then i upsized that to a cheap 5x2x2 which ended up being FOWRL as friend was luckily able to save my fish from the crash on the first tank. I love the 900 width and never really seen many tanks this size around. Also likes the 450 height, just makes it a little easier to reach things when the stand is 1m tall. Looking at keeping a mixed reef of Zoas, Acros, Monti's, Acans, Torch's, Hammers. Not really interested in having alot of fish, i really want a Leopard Wrasse or Choti Wrasse but need to design a way to keep sand in one side of the tank for this. Currently have a holding tank while I wait for the tank to get built.Ford Everest Concept SUV At Bangkok International Auto Show
The mid-size SUV segment has shown an increase in demand in the recent times and this seems to have pushed global manufacturers to develop even better products. Ford, one of the leaders in the SUV segment, has been working on a new 7 seater concept designed for ASEAN and global markets which was revealed in Sydney back in 2013.
Dubbed Ford Everest, the concept has recently been showcased at the Bangkok International Auto Show and if we have to describe the looks of the concept in one word, we would say ‘excellent’. The main reason that led to the creation of Ford Everest Concept is the utility segment’s rapid growth in the year 2013 – 13 percent to the precise. In the same year, Ford recorded a 35 percent increase in sales, thus motivating the brand to do even better.
The Everest concept looks sleek and refined, and has all the characteristics of a Ford. At the front is an inverted trapezoid grille sitting high enough complemented by nicely swept back headlamps that look contemporary. Together these two emphasize the new Ford face of the Everest and deliver a distinct, sporty feel to the vehicle.
Moving on to the sides, the body of the Everest is quite sleek, giving the concept a modern appearance. Last but not the least, the rear of the Everest is just as contemporary as the front and sides are. It features a robust and sculptural look, thanks to the chiseled taillamps and a flat, square liftgate.
The paint work is just as important as other characteristic features are and Ford knows this. To enhance the appeal of the Everest, Ford has used an exclusive ‘Sunset Flare’ paint that has a red base with a touch of orange.
The concept was designed in Australia by Ford’s regional design and product development team. Expectedly, the Everest Concept will hit the product line in the near future and will join the recently-introduced Ford EcoSport in the ASEAN region.Learn why the Anthem community in Broomfield, Colorado is a hot real estate location!

So, the main intention of debt settlement program is to create your creditor forgive Section of your debt, Placing you inside a desperate economic scenario. Generally, this method contains a unfavorable effect on your fiscal situation. You'll be able to’t Handle your finance and wreck your payment historical past.
Your provide to Mastercard is £920. You then do the same calculation for every creditor, using Every unique debt while in the calculation.
This article is about debt-settlement companies, as well as Necessities you need to know about debt settlement.
Yet another new provision of the Final Rule allows debt relief companies to demand that customers set aside their fees and cost savings for payment to creditors in the “focused account.” Even so, providers could only need a focused account provided that five conditions are satisfied:
Have federal university student loans Cannot protect tax obligations Can not sacrifice their credit history minor bit Have house loan financial loans
It is very important to make sure the creditor accepts your total and ultimate settlement offer you in producing. Be sure to hold a replica in the event that there is a dispute. This could occur decades later so you may need the letter as evidence. Hardly ever deliver a lump-sum payment before the supply is approved.
As challenging as it can be, individual bankruptcy offers a formal construction for debtors to confront their obligations less than court supervision. At the time a customer files for individual bankruptcy, creditors are notified and interest and late penalties normally halt accruing over the accounts, Whilst they keep on to mount in the course of the debt-settlement approach.
Just how long could it be about to just take to save up adequate dollars to settle a considerable debt, and so are your creditors planning to wait that extensive? Typically they won’t, and Whilst you’re making payments to build up the money for that settlement, your debts turn out to be additional and more previous thanks.
Debt settlement offers you the lowest full fees and the shortest time for finding outside of debt though staying away from bankruptcy. It also provides the bottom month to month payment for just about any debt relief solution. Made for people who are enduring some sort of economic hardship, It's not “a straightforward way out.” There isn't a gain with out some discomfort.
For settlements which can be paid out more than quite a few months, a professional has the experience to understand what the bottom regular payment that a creditor will settle for, and the amount of months a creditor is willing to extend out the payment.
You need to use the sample letter Comprehensive and remaining settlement give to create total and remaining provides in your creditors.
A debt settlement can have a spectacular, damaging effect on your credit history report and your credit rating score. Debt settlements carried out via for-financial gain companies will appreciably harm your credit for a minimum of six comprehensive a long time within the time the last payment is built on Just about every debt.
Long system – The timeframe generally operates two to three a long time just before it might be settled. Throughout this time, chances are you'll accrue penalties and late fees.
A buyer makes regular monthly payments to your debt settlement organization, or to the lender (or financial institution agent) who holds the "believe in" account. A part of Every payment is taken as service fees for the debt settlement corporation, and The remainder is set in the believe in account. The patron is informed not to pay for anything to your creditors.
If you and your lender can’t work out a approach, Make contact with a housing counseling company. Some organizations limit their counseling products and services to homeowners with FHA mortgages, but several offer you free enable to any homeowner who’s acquiring difficulty generating home finance loan payments.
The Bottom Line: Debt settlement is the best solution for particular people with a significant debt difficulty. When you've got much more than $10,000 in unsecured debt and so are battling to help make your payments or really feel that you'll be going to get to that time, you should take into account debt settlement.
Commonly, creditors conform to forgive a large Component of what you owe. Settlements normally are attained that decrease the debt by 40% to sixty% of what you owe, though outcomes could vary widely.
You won't be able to carry on utilizing any with the credit cards or other accounts enrolled right into a Debt Settlement program. When you find yourself negotiating to own creditors forgive half or more on the balances owed, they basically is not going to extend far more credit history unless you carry the account present once again and acquire again with a plan to pay off the complete stability. However, at New Period we know it’s tough to make do without a minimum of a person credit card for identification and/or unexpected emergency needs.
Depending upon the region, different guidelines regulate professional debt settlement companies. In the United States, debt reduction companies are needed to supply info ahead of time of the buyer signing up to the solutions, such as the Charge as well as terms. A reputable enterprise will make use of a Federal Deposit Coverage Corporation-insured have faith in account.
You and only you're going to be in command of all settlement resources and underneath no instances will ClearOne Advantage have custody or Charge of the money you put aside to fund debt settlements.
When settlements are finalized, the phrases are set in crafting. It is prevalent that you will make a single lump-sum payment in Trade for your creditor agreeing the debt has become $0 as well as the subject shut.
People who are deeply in debt frequently don't have a beneficial Web worth, so it’s exceptional to pay for taxes on the forgiven debt stability. One particular exception is a person which has a higher amount of property equity, which might make the overall net value beneficial and thus negate the insolvency exclusion. Having said that, this is the exception instead of the rule. Take into account that these are definitely generalities rather than supposed as tax guidance. We recommend you talk about this using your accountant. How about creditor phone calls?
Ideally, You can find some Charge saving involved with debt consolidation. The a person new bank loan must have a reduce interest level and regular payment as opposed to mixed cost of the expenses you consolidated.
Debt settlement programs normally are made available from for-financial gain companies, and entail them negotiating together with your creditors to assist you to shell out a “settlement” to resolve your debt — a lump sum which is lower than the entire sum that you simply owe. For making that lump sum payment, the program asks that you put aside a selected amount of cash every month in discounts.
I would like to thank every one of the of men and women at Elite that served me out, but Specially (name withheld). He was a terrific negotiator! I'd personally absolutely propose this enterprise to any person wanting to get away from debt promptly.

In Chapter seven, specified belongings are regarded exempt — dwelling, car, retirement personal savings, some applications and several household furnishings — but all others are liquidated plus the resources utilized to pay back your creditors.
Collectors may well not harass you, lie, or use unfair practices when they try to gather a debt. And they need to honor a published request from you to prevent further more contact.
Healthcare costs are another reason why Lots of people fall into debt as is gambling, yes gambling. Regrettably, one among the most important here explanation why A lot of people have fallen to this point into debt is because of very poor cash administration techniques. They merely didn’t make an effort necessary to learn some of the Fundamental principles of cash management such as budgeting or haven't been wise in how they utilised their charge cards.
A agency that costs you for their providers only just after an account is settled has a greater determination to settle your debts.
Federal pupil loans can also’t be settled as a consequence of federal law. Non-public pupil financial loans could possibly be eligible. Loans built right by a school might be eligible, so check with your debt marketing consultant.
Accepting a no fascination, or low fascination, introductory price on the bank card is frequently used as a substitute for an unsecured particular loan for debt consolidation.
Credit history score impression – Despite the fact that you'll be having away from debt, the fact that You can't pay out the full debt appears on your credit rating being a adverse. In keeping with an post in Forbes Journal, it may take nearly seven yrs to remove this black mark from the credit history report.
Debt settlement companies will cost you expenses for negotiating your debt, and people service fees can elevate the quantity you owe towards the extent that debt settlement will not be advantageous. In addition, debt settlement companies often hold off negotiations with charge card companies, which document your payments as delinquent when you haven't been generating them simply because you considered your debt was getting settled.
The quantity it charges you to become debt free of charge is depending on several components which includes: your credit rating balances, your capacity to lead month-to-month escrow payments into your program, the amount which might be negotiated from your harmony And just how swiftly it is actually negotiated, and what costs your debt settlement organization expenses you. What are the tax implications?

Find suggestions from your tax adviser on Cancellation of Debt Earnings, and be sure you ask about IRS Type 982. Form 982 can be employed to justification your need to declare the forgiven debt as revenue.

Third, As with every job, there are actually approaches not simply mastered by an novice. With out Experienced coaching, the very likely consequence will be superior-proportion settlements in the best scenario, and outright failure in the worst scenario. When you consider that the overall payout such as professional expenses will nonetheless be significantly less than your initial balances, it helps make a lot more perception for the typical human being to get debt settlement help. How do I do know New Era is authentic?

All Rights Are SavedThere have been reports that Wren Academy Enfield will take the school site at Chase Farm Hospital but there has been no official statement yet and it’s possible that, if true, Chase Farm may only be a temporary site for a year or two while a larger more permanent site is secured – wherever that may be. Wren Academy has promised an announcement in the new year, so we are waiting for that and will share more news when we receive it.
Enfield Council’s Local Plan revision process has, as previously reported, been put on hold until after the local elections next May so that it won’t become an election issue. While there is still good protection for the Green Belt from both the Government and from the Mayor of London, housing targets are ever-increasing and some Councils are proposing to remove tracts of Green Belt and Metropolitan Open Land to meet housing and infrastructure needs. Many boroughs are further along with their new local plans than Enfield and some of the Green Belt de-designation has been permitted by the Government Inspectors who have to make sure each local plan is ‘sound’. Enfield’s draft Green Belt Technical Review, which was released before the process was put on hold, appears to rank the Enfield Road fields lower in terms of Green Belt value than other tracts nearby. We would fight against any proposal to remove protection from the fields. There are many valid arguments against the lower assessment and also now some precedents from other boroughs that could help us.
Although, we won’t know any more about the Council’s plans until late May or early June next year, we are continuing our proactive approach to the campaign. Enfield RoadWatch attended several fairs and festivals over the summer and found that support for Enfield’s Green Belt remains solid. We are also working with politicians, other campaign groups and local and national organisations to keep people aware of the issues.

Personal Selling
Published: 17th August 2015
Views: N/A
Tweet
Personal Selling is explained as a one-to-one interaction between the organisation's sales representative and the buyer/ potential buyer to influence and persuade them to make a purchase in a systematic, repetitive and measurable way. According to Jobber 2007, there are three types of personal selling techniques: -
a. Order Takers who only responds to the company's already committed/ loyal buyers.
b. Order Creators who don't directly receive any order from the buyers but they persuade and encourage the channel members to push their products to their prospects.
c. Order Getters are front line sales person who persuades the customers to make direct purchases.
Personal Selling follows a five stage process of selling: -
Stage I: - Prospecting: - Identifying the target market based upon the need, expectations and desires of the buyer.
Stage II: - Making First Contact: - It involves the preparation done by the sales representative before they meet their potential buyer. A good sales person identifies the objective, the expectation, the expected result, purpose of the visit/call, timing of making the visit/ call, information to be conveyed and preparation that they require before meeting the buyer.
Stage III: - Making Sales Call/ Presentation: - While making actual sales visit/ call the sales person must remember that they are focused, enthusiastic, calm, cool, confident, relaxed and have adequate product knowledge to list the benefits of buying the product, encourage queries, feedbacks and allow the customers to participate in the interaction process.
Stage IV: - Objection handling: - It refers to the technique through which sales person handles client's queries, questions and obstacles. The sales person should be tactful, courteous, calm, confident and respectful in handling such objections even if they are difficult to handle and tackle.
Stage V: - Closing the sale: - It is vital for any sales person to successfully close a deal so it is necessary for them to know the art of closing any sales call/ visit like asking when to call next, whether to place their order, encouraging feedback, identifying body language of the buyer, summarising the discussion, encouraging opportunities for future meeting etc.
Following are the definitions of Personal Selling: -
1. The presentation of a persuasive message by a seller to a potential customer or group of customers, generally in a face-to-face meeting. Personal selling can also take place through personal correspondence, telephone conversations, or emails.
2. Personal selling is a promotional method in which one party (e.g., salesperson) uses skills and techniques for building personal relationships with another party (e.g., those involved in a purchase decision) that results in both parties obtaining value.
3. Face to face interaction with one or more perspective purchasers for the purpose of making presentations, answering questions, and procuring orders" - Philip Kotler.
4. Face-to-face selling in which a seller attempts to persuade a buyer to make a purchase.
5.
Role/ Importance of Personal Selling: -
1. It helps to establish personal contacts and relations between the buyers and the organisation's sales representative.
2. There is verbal communication between both the parties and hence product information can be easily exchanged. Various product characteristics like price, colour, shape, design, technique, warranty, and service/delivery / installation issues can be easily demonstrated by the Sales Person to the possible buyer.
3. Doubts, queries of the buyer can be solved immediately and the Sales Person can receive immediate feedback, ideas, solutions, views, know about the likes, dislikes, taste, preferences of their buyer or potential buyer.
4. The objective of Personal Selling is not only to inform, persuade, and intimate the buyer but also to make actual sales of products/ services so the ultimate end objective of increasing sales of any organisation is achieved through Personal Selling.
5. The Sales Person can adopt a unique selling technique for each buyer according to their expectations and situations hence it is dyadic in nature and can analyse to how to sell to the satisfy the needs of the buyer.
6. It fosters two-way communication process where message is conveyed and feedback is received immediately.
7. It is a two way proactive and dynamic process rather than reactive and passive form of communication.
8. Through Personal Selling, the organisation can provide detailed information about their products/ services, advantages, unique features, availability, unique attributes of the product, special instructions about the product/ services.
9. Personal Selling enables the organisation o reach a more defined and concentrated market and approach their target market effectively
10. It educates and builds brand awareness among their potential target market about the new offerings to the organisation.
11. It aids other promotional technique like Advertising, Public Relations and Publicity. Advertising informs the buyers about the company's product/ services but Personal Selling persuades the customers to buy the products.
12. It is considered as an appropriate technique in selling complex items like financial services, automobiles, office equipment's like photocopier etc.
13. The Sales Personal needs the right attitude, appearances, body language and specialised product knowledge.

We know from Scripture that Christians are called to live differently. But what does that look like within the pressures of everyday life? How are Christians called to not just put up with, but actually give life to the people around us? Whether in your job, your friendship circles or the places you spend your free time, you are called to be the fragrance of Christ and intentionally "push back the effects of the Fall." Our panel gives ideas for doing this with passion and practical success.

JAMA recently announced that the Tokyo Motor Show will change its format to a biennial ‘new-style comprehensive show’ that includes passenger cars, motorcycles, commercial vehicles, commercial vehicle bodies, and vehicle parts, starting in autumn of 2007. It will be the only comprehensive show among the world’s ‘Big Five’ shows (
The 40th Tokyo Motor Show, under the slogan ‘Catch the News, Touch the Future’, will be held over 17 days from 26 October (Friday) to 11 November (Sunday) 2007, with press days on 24-25 October and public show days starting on 27 October. This means that the 40th Tokyo Motor Show will be the longest of the international motor shows currently accredited by the Organisation Internationale des Constructeurs d'Automobiles (OICA) headquartered in
JAMA also held press conferences on 13 July 2006 in Frankfurt and on 18 July in
At the London press conference, Mr Masao Oka, Director General of JAMA’s Tokyo Motor Show Office, explained the reasons for the show’s format change: ‘As far as the issues of safety, the environment and universal design requirements are concerned, the automobile industry has made progress in both R&D and the commercialisation of products that goes beyond the distinction between passenger cars and commercial vehicles. Taking this into account, we concluded that a comprehensive show was the best solution as this format would enable visitors to gain a broader understanding of the efforts of the automobile industry as a whole. Furthermore, its biennial format is expected to contribute to the cost-reduction efforts of participating companies.’
Mr Oka continued: ‘The Tokyo Motor Show has the largest number of visitors among the major OICA-accredited international motor shows, welcoming 1.51 million visitors in 2005. It is a top-class, global motor show that, in 2005, featured a total of 79 world premieres, including 56 by Japanese manufacturers and 23 by overseas manufacturers. The concept behind the 2007 Tokyo Motor Show is to provide a maximum amount of information, all in one compact space. The show will present even more hands-on, interactive special events, beginning with a clean-energy vehicle test-drive programme that includes cutting-edge fuel cell vehicles. We are going forward with our planning with the aim of becoming the number-one show, in terms of both number of visitors and media satisfaction.’Auto-Close Gate 5-Bar Extension - White, Model# 4805

Updated 8:44 pm, Monday, January 13, 2014
Caption
SAN ANTONIO — A new multimillion-dollar entertainment complex on the Northwest Side is expected to be a boon to local entertainment as well as attract tourists.
TopGolf finalized its plans last week for a San Antonio location, which will be the golf entertainment company's first in San Antonio, the seventh Texas location and 15th overall.
Officials expect to get a good share of tourists from out of the United States, specifically from Mexico.
The 65,000-square-foot, three-level golf and entertainment venue, expected to open in late fall, will be across Interstate 10 from Six Flags Fiesta Texas and The Shops at La Cantera, according to a news release issued by the company. TopGolf San Antonio will feature a full bar and kitchen as well as more than 230 high-definition televisions.
The estimated $15 million complex will be modeled after a Houston location and will hire about 450 personnel (about 100 full-time positions), according to the San Antonio Business Journal. The facility is expected to serve 400,000 visitors in its first year and to generate $264.5 million in economic output over 10 years.

What do you think?I was speaking to a new, sweet friend a couple of days ago. I posted a review of 52 Things a Son Needs From Their Moms and I really enjoyed it. It’s right on, as far as I am concerned. It’s how we have parented our children and have seen the fruit of doing it that way. Our children love God with all of their beings and have servants hearts. I know that can only be God.
She mentioned to me that her son is older and she might have failed him. I just felt like I wanted to run and give her a big hug! In my humble opinion, I feel that it is never too late. When we are honest with our mistakes, so our children don’t think we are hypocritical, they will come to respect us. If they know we love them, that’s what matters. Woo them and win their hearts.
I know one thing for certain, and that is God is sovereign. He gave you the children you have because He knew you were the best one for the challenge. Nobody else could do a better job beca
use you were the one God picked. He knew that you have what it takes, with His help.
Be encouraged, friends. Seek God with every area of your life, serve together, do life together! Play with your kids and look into their eyes when they talk. They will fall madly in love with you.
I read something once that really stuck with me. What do your children see in your eyes when they come into the room? Do you look happy to see them? Don’t have time for them? Can’t look up from your iPod? Look annoyed? Delighted? You know, a huge smile and a look into their eyes saying that you are happy to see them will do wonders to their attitude. It melts the frost.
If I was honest, I would have to say that our eyes do just as much talking as our mouths.
Let your kids see how happy your are when they are near. Drown them in love, hugs, kisses and time. I don’t care how big they are. My teenager still gets his little nose and forehead kissed. As much as he fights it, you can’t argue with the huge smile on his face. ❤
So, be encouraged!! You haven’t failed, friends!! When you do, go to them and say, “You know what? I really screwed that up. Can you pray for me because I’m really struggling with _____ right now?” Buh-Lieve me, my kids get to hear this ALL. THE. TIME.!!!
And remember, the time goes so quickly. Show them your “Happy to see you!! eyes” when they walk into the room!! Please!!! You won’t regret it. I PROMISE!10 things to remember when back-to-school shopping
Lukas Parra, 8, hands Kaitlyn Bradley, 12, a folder as they check off one more school supply. DEBORAH CANNON / AMERICAN STATESMAN
Today we offer our back-to-school shopping guide as well as a list of things to not forget to do before school starts and the best way to improve your school. More back-to-school tips can be found at Austin360.com/backtoschool.
Here are 10 more tips to consider when you’re out shopping:
- Go early. That means not the week before school starts. It also means early in the morning on a weekday when stores are fully stocked and not crowded.
- Shop other areas of the store. When the back-to-school aisle gets congested, head to the regular office supplies aisle. It’s less crowded and you can knock a bunch off items your list away from the crowds.
- Your time is money. You can save money by shopping many stores, or you can save on gas and time by choosing one big store. If you just need a couple of easy items, skip the crowds and go to a smaller store like a drug store or a dollar store.
- Anticipate needs. Think about what supplies you will need at home the entire school year. Stock up during sales on basics like pencils and notebook paper for middle-schoolers and high-schoolers before they get their official lists. Ask parents of a kid one grade older than yours what their child needed last year.
- Shop for value not just price. Remember, a cheap backpack won’t last the whole year. A thin T-shirt isn’t worth the $4 after the first hole.
- Bigger isn’t better. Back-to-school specials might make the 10-pack of pencils less expensive than the 30-pack or the two-pack of glue sticks a better value than the eight-pack.
- Use coupons and store deals wisely. Before you go, look online to see what specials are out there, but don’t get suckered into store deals. The 5 percent you save at one store might not be enough to overcome to great prices at another store.
- Tax-free weekend (Aug. 5-7) isn’t always the best. You’ll be fighting crowds and sometimes the 8.25 percent you save isn’t as much as the 10-, 20-, 30-percent off deals that happen at the end of the back-to-school season.
- Don’t bring the kids. For basics that will be shared with the whole class or are standard items, go it alone. Bringing the kids means more opportunities for unnecessary items to get into your basket.
- Do bring the kids, but set a budget. For personal items like backpacks and clothes, let kids pick them out, but set a limit of how much you are willing to spend. For a really smart lesson, bring the $30 cash you have allotted for a backpack and lunch box, or the $200 for new clothes, and let your child figure it out. When the money is gone, it’s gone.
Share your shopping tips with us by posting a comment on this story. Happy school shopping and don’t forget to enjoy the summer before it’s done.

The glaucomas are a group of irreversible blinding optic neuropathies that affect over 70 million people worldwide [1]. Glaucoma is often associated with increased intraocular pressure (IOP) leading to damage of the optic nerve. The imbalance of aqueous humor production and outflow results from IOP elevation. The aqueous humor is actively produced by the ciliary body epithelium and exits the eye through the structures of the anterior chamber angle after bathing the lens and the cornea. The aqueous humor outflow experiences most resistance at the level of trabecular meshwork (TM) [2]. In open-angle glaucoma, poorly understood structural and functional changes in the TM such as remodeling of the TM extracellular matrix (ECM) are associated with increased resistance, which impedes the aqueous outflow [3-5]. The ECM changes in the TM have been suggested by several biochemical studies [4,6,7] and directly supported by ultrastructural studies [5,8]. Changes and/or remodeling of the ECM can occur in a variety of ways such as increased secretion and decreased degradation of matrix proteins, cell adhesion, migration, and changes in cell shape and number [7,9]. Degradation of ECM components by matrix metalloproteases enables changes in cell morphology, adhesion, and migration. Increased secretion and/or secretion of altered forms of proteins including matrix metalloproteases are approaches employed by cells in ECM remodeling as well. The precise role of matrix metalloproteases in the ECM remodeling has been the subject of several studies [10-12]. However, intracellular proteases also have the potential to provoke ECM changes by processing expressed matrix gene products [13,14] and modifying different forms of receptors/transporters that are important for entry and exit of key cellular homeostatic components such as the endothelin B receptor [15]. However, comprehensive studies in changes of TM intracellular proteases have not been performed. Recent investigations suggest that important alterations including impairment of intracellular proteases due to posttranslational modifications occur in the glaucomatous TM [6,14]. The changes in the intracellular protease proteome can be identified using high-throughput proteomic mass spectrometric approaches. One of the challenges in proteomic studies lies in reducing the complexity in capturing, identifying, and eventually quantifying the proteome changes [16]. Here, we present a simple and efficient method that allows better capturing of TM intracellular proteases. This method will enhance our understanding of TM intracellular protease changes that occur as part of glaucoma pathophysiology.
Normal eyes (Table 1) were procured from the National Disease Research Institute (Philadelphia, PA) and the Lions Eye Bank (Miami, FL). The eyes were enucleated within 10 h of death, placed in a moisture chamber at 4 °C, and transported. These eyes were dissected within 48 h, and the TM was carefully excised for study. Fresh porcine TM tissue was isolated from freshly enucleated eyes from euthanized pigs procured from the University of Miami Department of Surgery following IACUC approved protocols.
TM was carefully dissected from normal cadaver eyes. TM cytosolic and nuclear protein extracts were obtained using the NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents kit (Cat number 78833; Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL) and following the protocols recommended by the manufacturer. The recovered proteins were subjected to spectrophotometric quantification using the Bradford assay and subsequently aliquoted for use or stored at −80 °C for future analysis. All protein aliquots were either freshly used or subjected to only one freeze–thaw cycle.
Approximately 10 µg of total cytosolic and nuclear protein extracts were fractionated on a 4%–20% Tris-glycine gradient gel (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA), transferred onto a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane, and incubated overnight at 4 °C with the antibodies (~5 μg/ml) detailed below. For these analyses, rabbit monoclonal antibody against histone H3 (Cat number 05–928; Upstate®, Billerica, MA) and rabbit polyclonal antibody against GAPDH (Cat number sc-25778; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) were used. Subsequently, a 2 h incubation at 4 °C with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase secondary antibodies was performed. All incubations occurred in 5% milk. Detection was performed using electrochemiluminescence (ECL; catalog number 32106; Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL).
The enrichment column was prepared by ultraviolet (UV) cross-linking of peptides present in commercial protease inhibitor cocktails. Two different protease inhibitors (100 µl each; Protease inhibitor cocktail for use with mammalian cell and tissue extracts and Sigma Fast Protease inhibitor tablets for general use, Cat number P8340 and S8820, respectively; Sigma-Aldrich Inc., St. Louis, MO) were incubated with 200 µl (2.5 mg) of Protein A Sepharose beads (Cat number 170780–01; Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) for 15 min and subsequently UV cross-linked for 90 s at 120 mJ/cm2 in a UV transilluminator equipped with 254 nm bulbs. A cytosolic protein extract was added (~250 µg) and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle shaking. For the controls, no protease inhibitor was added to the sample (two different protease inhibitor cocktails, which slightly differ in their composition of inhibitory peptides, were used to rule out the possibility that the capture of proteases is not vastly different between the two). A 2 ml column (Cat number 89896; Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL) was equilibrated with 1 ml 1X PBS. The samples were passed through the column three times and then washed with 250 µl 1X PBS twice. Subsequently, 100 µl of 1 M NaCl plus 100 mM KCl were used for elution. Finally, the elution products were subjected to acetone precipitation with the addition of four volumes of cold acetone and to incubation at room temperature for 15 min with or without carrier tRNA (Yeast tRNA; Catalog number 15401029; Invitrogen Inc., Carlsbad, CA). Carrier tRNA was added to enhance the capture of proteins during acetone precipitation. The samples were then centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 20 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in 5 µl of water.
The fractionation of elution products was performed either on a 4%–20% Tris-glycine gradient gel (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA) or on a 4%–15% gradient PHAST gel (Cat number 17–0678–01; GE Healthcare Biosciences Corp, Piscataway, NJ). The gel was subjected to Coomassie Blue staining followed by SyproRuby Protein Gel Stain (Cat number S12001; Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA) and silver staining (Pro-Pure protein assay, Cat number M2271Lkit; AMRESCO Inc., Solon, Ohio). Approximately, 10 µg of the TM protein extracts (total cytosolic and nuclear extract) was also loaded on the 4%–20% Tris-glycine gel. On 4%–15% PHAST gel, 4 µg of cytosolic extract was also loaded in addition to eluents.
For mass spectrometric identification of proteins, gel slices were excised and digested in situ with sequencing grade porcine trypsin (Promega Biosciences Inc., San Luis Obispo, CA). The products of in situ digestion were loaded onto pre-columns 360 mm od x 100 mm id fused silica (Polymicro Technologies, Phoenix, AZ) packed with 3 cm of irregular 5–15 µm-non-spherical C18 (YMC Inc., Wilmington, NC). The column was washed with 0.1 M acetic acid (AcOH) for 5 min before switching in-line with the resolving column (7-cm spherical C18, 360 od x 100 id). Once the columns were in-line, the peptides were gradient eluted with a 0%–100% B in 30 min where A was 0.1 M AcOH in nanopure water and B was 0.1 M AcOH in 80% acetonitrile. All samples were analyzed using a Thermo Electron Finnigan LTQ (San Jose, CA). Electrospray was accomplished using an Advion Triversa Nanomate (Advion Biosystems, Ithaca, NY) with a voltage of 1.7 kV and a flow rate of 250 nl/min. The mass spectrometer was operated in data dependent mode with the top five most abundant ions in each spectrum being selected for sequential tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) experiments. The exclusion list was used (1 repeat, 180 s return time) to increase the dynamic range. All MS/MS spectra were searched with Sequest version 2.7 (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA) and Mascot using NCBI non-redundant, Ensemble, and SwissProt databases. The search of database entries were restricted to Human and Metazoa (animals) and allowed for a maximum of two missed cleavages. The protonated molecule ions “MH+” and “Monoisotopic” were defined for the peak mass data input. The SEQUEST Sp and Xcorr cutoff scores of the protonated “MH+” peptides were 500 and 1.8, respectively. For Mascot searches, the score was greater than 78. All spectra were visually inspected for determination of correct database assignment. The potential chemical modifications of a peptide such as alkylation of a cysteine (carbamidomethyl [C]), oxidation of a methionine residue (M), and acetylation of a lysine (K) were also considered in the search. No restrictions were imposed for either the protein isoelectric point or the molecular weight during the search.
Human TM samples were solubilized using buffers provided in the NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents kit (Pierce Biotechnology Inc.) and subjected to fractionation into cytosolic and nuclear fractions as described in Methods. The cytosolic fraction was subjected to affinity enrichment for proteases over a P8340 or a S8820 peptide inhibitor cocktail column. The column affinity enrichment resulted in the recovery of very small amounts of proteins. SDS–PAGE fractionation of proteins (4%–20% gradient mini gels; Invitrogen Inc.) did not allow detection of protein bands upon Coomassie Blue (Figure 1A) or silver staining (Figure 1B). The same amount of eluted proteins in a final volume of 4 µl was loaded onto a six-well PHAST gel (GE Healthcare) and subjected to fractionation and staining. Both Coomassie blue and silver staining allowed detection of the eluted bands (Figure 1C,D). To ensure the fractionation of cytosolic and nuclear proteins, the total protein, cytosolic, and nuclear fractions were subjected to western blot analyses (Figure 1E,F). When the blot was probed with antibody against GAPDH, only total and cytosolic extracts showed presence of GAPDH immunoreactivity (Figure 1E). On the other hand, probing the blot with histone H3 antibody revealed reactivity in the total and nuclear extracts and not in the cytosolic extract (Figure 1F), suggesting fractionation of total proteins into cytosolic and nuclear extracts..
The recovery of proteins within a 50–250 µg range of initial material was found to be enhanced with the use of carrier molecules (yeast t-RNA). The electrolytes, a combination of sodium and potassium, have an effect on the recovery of silver stained proteins. The addition of potassium chloride increased the recovery of proteins (data not shown). The addition of potassium chloride and carrier tRNA also reduced batch to batch variation in recovery especially with low initial loads (50–250 µg).
In normal TM, a total of 20 proteins were identified (Table 2). The majority of the identified proteins are proteases encompassing both serine and cysteine proteases (Table 2). Several protease inhibitors such as anti-chymotrypsin, anti-trypsin, and anti-thrombin were also identified (Table 2). Some non-protease proteins were also identified (Table 2). At this point, it is not well understood why these proteins/peptides showed strong binding. Proteases can bind to peptides, which are not their known high affinity substrate analog. Consequently, the TM proteases identified by affinity enrichment may or may not have a direct peptide inhibitor/analog. We identified all proteases from one single TM tissue in our current analyses that were identified from combined multiple numbers of TMs by proteomic analysis in a previous study [17]. The enhancement of identification in the current study is due to affinity enrichment of proteases. Although the total number of intracellular proteases identified are the same in our previous and in our current analyses (Table 2), they are different in two respects. First, all identified proteases are from a single TM tissue sample rather than from multiple TM samples, and second, all identified protease peptide matches (coverage) are greater than our previous analysis. In the previous analyses, fewer proteases were identified from a single TM tissue. All the proteases enlisted in Table 2 were identified only when six different TM samples were combined [17]. There are some non-protease proteins (for example, protease inhibitor anti-trypsin) for which fewer peptides were identified in the current analysis than in our previous analysis. However, overall a better capture of protease peptides was obtained with affinity enrichment as described above.
Glaucoma is thought to be due to increased resistance at the TM, which impedes aqueous humor outflow. Changes in the ECM are responsible for the altered resistance. Increased production of ECM proteins or, alternatively, processed secreted protein products may result in changes in the matrix composition and in ECM remodeling. Several factors such as elevated pressure or mechanical stretching have also been shown to influence ECM gene expression of the TM in vivo and in cultured TM cells [13,18]. While the role of matrix metalloproteases has been well studied in TM remodeling [4,10], changes in the TM intracellular proteases have been the subject of scant studies. Cellular proteasome have been found to undergo oxidative modification, resulting in the impairment of their function in the glaucomatous TM [6,19,20]. A comprehensive and quantitative investigation of the TM proteasomal activities also remains to be performed.
The proteomic analysis of clinically relevant tissues requires access to fresh or frozen specimens with adequate morphological consistency and sufficient quantity as well as proper and detailed clinical records [21]. The availability of such properly preserved tissues is often scarce especially ocular tissues. This fact limits meaningful outcome of proteomic analyses. Obtaining sufficient quantity of different ocular tissues is important for proteomic and genomic analyses, one providing complementary information to the other. Enrichment of proteins is a necessity due to the tiny nature of tissue regions in the case of ocular tissues. The TM is one such region where the availability of the amount of tissue material from a single donor is often limited (due to the tiny nature of the region), and without enrichment, successful identification of protease proteome will be severely limited.
Identification of proteins by mass spectrometry can be limited by several factors even for very sensitive mass spectrometers. Some of these factors are: a masking effect by other, abundant proteins with similar isoelectric points, overlay by proteins that undergo better digestion and thus generating peptides in the similar isoelectric point range, and finally, peptides more susceptible to ionization and thus coming in close proximity to mass/charge ratio with respect to peptides of interest. The reduction of the complexity of the protein mixture (in protein extracts) is an important aspect in the mass spectrometric identification of proteins. Immobilized inhibitor or substrate analog entrapment of enzymes is an important means for enrichment of enzymes including proteases which reduce complexity while enriching the proteins. Several other fractionation techniques have been used in an attempt to reduce the complexity in conjunction with affinity enrichment, including 2D blue native gel electrophoresis which resolves protein complexes in a non-denaturing first dimension gel followed by the fractionation of the complex components in a denaturing second dimension gel [22].
The immobilized inhibitors or inhibitory peptides have been in use for affinity purification. Immobilized peptide arrays have been used for epitope mapping as well as protein–protein interaction, enzyme-substrate interaction, and enzyme-inhibitor interaction studies [23]. Inhibitor affinity chromatography, using immobilized substrate analogs or other inhibitors, has been employed to isolate enzyme proteomes and is often referred to as the chemiproteomic approach [24]. Affinity enrichment of many different enzymes such as kinases, phosphatases, and matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) have benefited from the use of this approach [24-28]. However, such approaches are yet to be applied to the comprehensive enrichment of intracellular proteases, particularly in the ocular tissues [28,29]. Immobilized inhibitors have not only been used for affinity enrichment but also for several other novel uses [30-32]. Surface-immobilized, oriented peptide aptamers have been used for the detection of specific target proteins in complex biologic solutions [27]. Aprotinin-linked fibrinogen in a novel approach has been used for controlling degradation of fibrin gels [32]. The precursor state of factor Xa heparin-binding exosite was revealed by Ixolaris binding to factor X in a novel fashion [31]. Label-free, high-throughput functional lytic assays based on immobilized inhibitors or substrates have made the development of refractive index-sensitive resonant waveguide grating biosensors possible [30]. Affinity enrichment of MMPs is a routine procedure for non-ocular tissues [28,29]. The approach outlined here can be used in combination with immobilized MMP target peptides and immobilized metal and gelatin GQ columns to enable the capture of MMPs and their tissue inhibitors. Sequential capture of matrix and intracellular proteases from the same tissue is possible by combination of these techniques, maximizing the utility of tissue toward comprehensively discovering changes in the protease proteome composition in glaucoma (or any other disease) in comparison to the normal state. Additives or carrier molecules, which are usually proteins, electrolytes, and tRNAs, enhance recovery of biomacromolecules including proteins and DNA [33,34]. The carrier molecules usually act as chaperones and help entrap low amounts of protein following elution. Electrolytes typically promote charge-charge interaction and help in coagulation thus facilitating enhanced recovery. We have used two different inhibitor peptide cocktails to determine whether there are vast differences in their efficiency to capture target proteins. tRNA was added to enhance the recovery of proteins while it serves as a carrier molecule during acetone precipitation.
Compared to our previous analyses [17], current analyses captured a greater number of protease peptides from a single TM sample, demonstrating the utility and efficacy of the fractionation strategy presented here. Several serine and cysteine proteases have thus been identified (Table 2). In particular, several complement components have also been identified. It is important to note that complement components have been found to impair synapses and have been implicated in neurodegeneration of retinal ganglion cells, a process that is thought to occur in glaucoma [35]. Our analyses also revealed the release and capture of mitochondrial neurolysin and tripeptidyl peptidase II (Table 2). Tripeptidyl peptidase II is a component of the proteolytic cascade acting downstream of the 26S proteasome in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway [36,37]. Tripeptidyl peptidase II is thought to be able to complement the 26S proteasome function under conditions in which the latter is inhibited. Therefore, the expression of tripeptidyl peptidase II in normal TM suggests that perhaps in at least some eyes, the proteasomal function is impaired long before the pathology is apparent. Our efforts to capture protease proteome in the DBA/2J mouse model using combinatorial affinity enrichment methods outlined above is under progress to further our understanding of these proteases and their alterations.

.Cares of the co-founders of Google for autonomous vehicles is well known. Apparently he dreams but also of cars that can fly. There, he is not the only one but probably the strongest.
A car is in a traffic jam. The navigation system proposes an alternative route: take off vertically, 30 degrees right, then straight ahead and finally gently in the own garden land such as the American President on the lawn at the White House. A tantalizing idea and with a not entirely unrealistic vision. Finally each plane can drive anyway. Only most of the time the wings in the way are on roads, and probably the flying car has folding wings.
What look like the prototypes of Zee.Aero is however completely unknown. But apparently the ideas of engineers, who have previously worked at NASA and Boeing are so fascinating that Google co-founder should have invested Larry page about $100 million since 2010 in the project.
$100 million sounds like monster much, but conceivable, because the sum would be equivalent to only 0.3 percent of its assets estimated by Forbes. For several years, around 150 employees at Zee.Aero should work to develop of a flying car. The company is locked and tells on his Web page only, that you work on “better ways to get from A to B”. That these better types also have something to do with flying might, suggests only from the fact that the company is looking for among other things engineers with experience in building aircraft.
Vertical launch and landing
Zee.Aero is also working according to their own presentation on the “interface between aerodynamics, advanced production and electric drive”. It was then but also on info. Who’s behind this and what exactly is being developed, remained dark until now, BusinessWeek revealed: the company is working on an electric two-seater, which can take off vertically and land. And the whole thing with the money from Larry Page.
Page should invest there money Kitty Hawk in the company who also pursues the goal of flying cars, only with a different approach. And behind this company, the German computer scientist Sebastian Thrun, Solingen would in turn blow formerly for Google that drove the autonomous car and also the first in secret.
Competitors must hurry
According to BusinessWeek, page wanted to keep absolutely secret its commitment on this issue. But now it’s out. For the competitors in the fight for the first production-ready flying car. So far, Europeans seemed there anyway to have the nose forward. Slovak engineers, for example, presented their Aeromobil that normal can drive on the road, but only 200 meter grass runway needed to be able to get into the air one and a half years ago.
A Bavarian company wants to bring its mini flyer called Lilium into 2018 the market, and the project met already the targets, which apparently also has Zee.Aero: he can take off vertically and land and is electrically powered.
However, the ufo-like aircraft TF-X of company Terrafugia is designed as a hybrid with electric motor and internal combustion engine.Amazon.com: Giant World MegaMap, Laminated, 77″ x 46 Giant World Map: Posters | eBay giant world map mural blue ocean by maps international

MEDIA RELEASE
Big Island police have issued a total of 313 citations for seat belt and child restraint violations since May 20, 2002, the beginning of the statewide “Click It or Ticket” campaign.
The federally funded project is aimed at increasing the use of seat belts and child restraint seats throughout Hawaii.
In addition, police officers issued 179 other miscellaneous citations at a total of 31 seat belt checkpoint locations.
During the seat belt campaign, police officers will be checking for seat belt violations from Wednesday (May 29, 2002) through Tuesday (June 4, 2002) at the following checkpoint locations around the island:
Kuakini Highway at Hualalai Road, Kuakini Highway at Hawaii Belt Road, Hawaii Belt Road at City of Refuge Road, Hind Road in Captain Cook, Kalani Street at Kalawa Street, Hawaii Belt Road at South Point Road, Alii Drive at Kamehameha III Road.
Queen Kaahumanu Highway at Hapuna Beach Road, Kawaihae Road at Queen Kaahumanu Highway, Palani Road at Queen Kaahumanu Highway, Kohala Mountain Road at Scenic Point, Wal-Mart in Kona, Kona Coast Shopping Center, Pakalana at Lehua.
Kanoelehua at Hualani Street, Hawaii Belt Road at Laupahoehoe Police Station Road, Kamehameha Avenue at Kalanianaole Street, Kaumana at Komohana Street, Wal-Mart in Hilo, Punahele at Halai.
Hawaii Belt Road at Oshiro Road, Kanoelehua Avenue at Kawailani Street, Keaau-Pahoa Road by Pahoa Post Office, Malaai Road at Hoaka Road.
State law mandates that all front seat occupants and occupants under 18 years of age, regardless of where they are sitting, must wear seat belts. In addition, children under 4 years of age must be properly restrained in a child restraint.
The fine for failure to comply with the law is $67 if paid before the scheduled court date. If paid on or after the scheduled court date, the fine increases to $92.
Hawaii County’s seat belt compliance rate has been estimated at more than 86 percent, according to Sergeant Randy Apele, head of the Traffic Services Section. The Big Island’s goal this year is to attain a 90 percent compliance rate, Apele said.
# # #Thoughts on Basic (and Not-So-Basic) Writing
So far in my graduate course this semester, among other readings, I've assigned Mina Shaughnessy's introduction to Errors and Expectations, an excerpt from Robert Connors' Composition-Rhetoric: Backgrounds, Theory, and Pedagogy, an excerpt from Ken Macrorie's Telling Writing, and David Bartholomae's "Inventing the University." These four I mention are really forming a constellation in my mind about teaching academic writing to beginners, especially the place of grammar, that dude who just will not leave the party.
For one thing -- as I'm pleased the students in class picked up on -- when most people say "grammar," they don't mean only grammar. It's a shorthand, umbrella term for a lot of organizational, rhetorical, and stylistic conventions that the user of the term "grammar" doesn't know how to articulate. Every time I read Bartholomae's essay (PDF), I'm re-impressed with how well he describes and demystifies the gestures and postures in academic writing.
I'm interested in looking at these readings with the question in mind of how basic writing should be taught. The approaches in the article I linked here are categorized well, but I have been thinking of two basic categories:
1. The Sequential Method
This approach has the goal of getting rid of sentence-level errors in grammar, spelling, and punctuation (GSP). When the writing is clearer in this regard, the instruction can then proceed to issues of genre, argument, etc. Proponents, at least the ones I've talked to, sometimes make the "you have to learn to crawl before you can learn to walk" comparison, which, by the way, isn't true for babies. Writing assignments may be sentences or paragraphs as well as essays; there's a pretty well-established collection of "paragraphs and essays" writing textbooks, many with GSP worksheets and exercises, tailored for this approach.
2. The Tandem Method
This approach, which seems to be favored in the scholarship I've read, calls for students to learn GSP and conventions of academic writing concurrently, so students would learn about making claims with reasons supported by credible evidence, analyzing audience, academic genres like annotated bibliographies, etc.* while learning GSP, but only the GSP the specific student needs to learn. The student may have subject-verb agreement mastered, so no sense spending time on that, but still need help in semicolon usage, for instance.
*OK, so maybe not a lot of Basic Writing teachers are assigning full-on annotated bibliographies. But still, the tandem method does have students focus on content and organization of whole essays from the beginning of the course.
I have more to say on this topic, but right now I'd rather go to sleep. I'm interested in exploring the possible advantages of each of the two methods. So far I have, for the sequential method: maybe the students whose GSP is improved after a course taught this way (and the research suggests there aren't many of those) are in a better position because some of the teachers they'll have in the future will be more positively predisposed toward them, more willing to believe that these students have intelligence and are not lost causes, and more willing to make the effort to teach the argument, analytical skills, genre conventions, and so forth.
BW and Annotated Bib
2 Board Alley
I teach the lower of two levels of Basic Writing at a community college, and here's what I've learned over the years. I teach "grammar" in tandem--or context with their writing. Otherwise, I wind up with students who can recognize error on tests but not in their own work. Whenever we go over a concept in grammar, I immediately ask the class to either write their own examples or open a file and find examples of what we've gone over. It's the ability to apply the concept or recognize the patterns in their own work that I'm after.
It's also tricky to teach "grammar" to students whose definition of "revision" means "handing over a paper to a teacher who will make all of the corrections so that you can correct your mistakes." In that context, real revision (as well as responsibility for the paper)seems like busywork, and the only valuable, important learning is in the worksheets.
Some of this behavior may also be rooted in the fact that it is far easier to fill out a worksheet than it is to puzzle out a paper.
And, I don't know if your university-level basic writers are the same as the ones I teach, which would make all of the above irrelevant.CHARLOTTE, NC (WBTV) – A mother assaulted her 3 year-old-daughter and 7-year old son earlier Saturday then killed herself by jumping off of a bridge on Interstate 485.

I was hooked! I realized the power of my writing and my attention to detail could make a big impact in the world. Of course, this was in the day when we still received the Federal Register in the mail. There was no internet. If we wanted to research a foundation, we made our way to the nearest library with a foundation section. We spent hours going through gigantic books and making copies of prospect information.
As you can imagine, I have witnessed much change in the grant-writing world over the past 30 years. Funders ask many different questions now than they did then. They require a lot more documentation. Their funding processes are often vastly different also.
One of the key changes I have seen over the past several years is a growing number of funders who want to know what percentage of your board members give financially to the organization. Some take it a step further and ask what percentage of your entire agency budget is donated by your board members. For those boards that do not have a 100% giving rate, this can be very problematic. In truth, the organization may not be awarded a grant because of poor board giving records. At the very least, they will lose points in the scoring process for this issue.
The bottom line here is that funders are social investors. They are looking for social ROI on their investment. They are looking for organizations and boards who are passionate enough about what they do and the impact they are having that they are personally making financial sacrifices to support the organization. It is already a very competitive grant world out there, be sure your board is not hindering your success with their lack of financial commitment.Despite camels being synonymous with the Middle East, the county of Saudi Arabia imported a lot of their camels from Australia. Though this was done not to replace their current camels but to put them on the dinner table as camel is used in a lot of meals in the country.
What!!!
Camels were imported here as beasts of burden when the inland and I mean inland - the desert areas of much of Australia is composed of.
When this was accomplished the camels were set free. They breed like rabbits another imported pest! Now we have more camels than they have in Saudi Arabia and cull them by helicopter shooters and export the meat to the Arab countries.
Camels here have become "feral" pests.
Around the Alice and in some parts of WA, they have camel races as tourist attractions and are also used as tourist attractions for rides on beach fronts in tourist areas along the northern and western coastlines.

When I tried to power on the Virtual Machine (VM) this morning I was not able to power up the VM and there is an error message:
This virtual machine appears to be in use. If this virtual machine is already in use, press the "Cancel" button to avoid damaging it. If this virtual machine is not in use, press the "Take Ownership" button to obtain ownership of it.
Configuration file: C:\Users\<UserName>\VirtualMachines\<VMName>\<VMName.vmx>
So when I try to clicked the "Take Ownership" of this VM client and failed. It keep on saying The virtual machine is in use by an application on your host computer but i just powered up my PC so it shouldn't be in use by anyone else.
Taking ownership of this virtual machine failed.
The virtual machine is in use by an application on your host computer.
Configuration file: C:\Users\<UserName>\VirtualMachines\<VMName>\<VMName.vmx>.
Below are the steps to resolve this issue and it is quite straight forward:
I recommend taking a backup before deleting any VM files, In case of any unforeseen or unprecedented occurrence.
In Windows Explorer, navigate to the folder which houses your VM files and Delete or Rename the sub-folder named "VMNAME.vmx.lck"
For example, if my VM was named as SANDUEL the folder to rename would be SANDUEL.vmx.lck. In this case, I rename the file name from SANDUEL.vmx.lck to SANDUEL.vmx.lck_old. This action is to allow when the VM power up, it will automatically create a new file.
Then now try to open up the VMWare Workstation and power on the Virtual Machine Client.
Now, the VM client should start up successfully. Try that and tell me if this is working for you.My firm takes your case seriously and will work hard to get you the most favorable result possible.

Interior Minister Said Mohammad Sammour told Lebanon's Al-Manar Hezbollah television station that the cause of blast had not yet been determined.
Iranian diplomats said two Iranians and four Syrians were wounded by the explosion.
The suburb is popular with Iranian and other Shiite pilgrims and is the location of a shrine dedicated to the granddaughter of the Prophet Muhammad.
A private Syrian television station, Ad-Dounial TV, said six people were killed in the blast. Iranian state television also reported six killed, including two Iranian bus drivers. It said the explosion occurred while the bus was fueling up at a gas station near the shrine.
Police sealed off the area and reporters were banned from reaching the site of the explosion.'1 In. x 20 In. Cold Chisel

Directions:
1. Combine the warm water and yeast in a large bowl. Let the mixture stand until yeast is foamy, about 5 min. If it does not become foamy, your yeast is probably old and not active- it's best to throw it out and start again.
2. With a wooden spoon, stir in butter, sugar, eggs and salt. Beat in flour, 1 cup at a time, until dough is too stiff to mix (some flour may not be needed). The dough should no longer be sticky. Place round ball of dough into a new bowl that has been sprayed with nonstick spray. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate 2 hours or up to 4 days.
3..
4. Preheat oven to 375° F. Bake until rolls are golden brown and cooked through, 15-20 min. If they are browning too quickly on top, tent foil over the rolls until finished baking. Brush warm rolls with melted butter, if desired. Break rolls apart to serve.Noise Monkey said in the other thread wrote:Komiyan wrote:Noise Monkey wrote:If anyone wants to volunteer to be the voice (whatever side) run with it.

Depends on how close to a clinic you are
Heh heh (nervous laughter)...
Well, unless, for some reason, you've got a clinic out back of the McD's Burger Joint that I got nabbed and interrogated in, I'd say not that close. But I might be able to send some business your way....

He was one of the great photographic innovators, and is remembered for having pushed the boundaries of the medium to new levels. Weston was an artist who found beauty in everything, from a discarded pair of boots to a mountain range, and he helped see photography into its greatest period when the camera's mechanical clarity was at last embraced by artists, rather than smothered by artifice and hackneyed notions of the picturesque.
One of the key, early exponents of Modernism in America, Weston has become a major figure in art history. His efforts to celebrate the camera's unique power, inspired an entire generation of photographers who sought to emulate his straight photography', as it became known. His work is held in virtually every museum collection that counts, and the original prints that he made fetch huge sums in 2007, a vintage print of his famous Nautilus Shell photograph, 1927, sold for over $1,100,000 at Sotheby's in New York.
The 37 prints in this exhibition were made by Edward Weston's son Cole, in the decades after his Father's death, from the original negatives, and come directly from the family. These prints were made in small numbers, with both exquisite precision and the qualities that Cole knew his father demanded. It is these prints that dominate the dynamic secondary market in Edward Weston's work today, and give collectors a comparatively affordable opportunity to own a photographic masterpiece, by one of the great names in the photographic canon.
The show promises to be one of the most exciting photography exhibitions in London this autumn.
