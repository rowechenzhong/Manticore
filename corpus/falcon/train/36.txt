Areas of language that are problematic in production but not readily amenable to comprehension testing are also discussed.Conclusions: The notion of expressive language disorder has been formalized in classification systems and is implicit if not explicit in the organization of many standardized tests. However, a close inspection of the evidence suggests that deficits in language expression are typically accompanied by limitations in language knowledge or difficulties processing language input. For this reason, the diagnostic category of expressive language disorder should be used with considerable caution. This view has implications for both research and clinical practice.

"I said NHL teams would not play again until our economic problems had been solved," Commissioner Gary Bettman said.
"It is my sad duty to announce that because that solution has not yet been attained, it no longer is practical to conduct even an abbreviated season."
Bettman denied reports that the players and owners had been close to a settlement.
"We weren't as close as people were speculating," he said. "We were still very far apart."
Union chief Bob Goodenow said every offer the players made came closer to the owners' stance.
"We never had a real negotiating partner," Goodenow said.
With no pressure remaining to reach an agreement, the sport's future is in question.
"The best deal that was on the table is gone," Bettman said. "At some point we have to go back to the table, but I can't tell you when or under what circumstances."did you do xf86config? also what video card do you got
For some reason X refuses to operate --- period. I tried reinstalling, but still a no go.
If I use the XF86Config file that is installed by default, X just freezes, and I need to reset thte PC. If I reconfigure, it just hangs. I can generally CTL-ALT-DEL or CTL-X to quit out, but still not always.
Any ideas?
did you do xf86config? also what video card do you got
yes I did.
Geforce FX 5700 Ultra.
I have even tried the last RedHat backup I have. Still not working. at least now it doesnt lock hard, but none of the fonts work. And I cant see anything. The log whines now about the fonts. But I still have some refresh issue.
have you tried installing the latest nvidia driver?
no, I havent even downloaded it yet. I see no reason why Slackware's "nv" shouldnt work as Red Hat, SuSE, Mandrake, and Libranet all have.
My schedule when loading linux is :
1) Install it
2) Get it up and running
3) Tweak it with better drivers
4) Hack it to shreds, if I have time.
hm thats quite odd, im using a geforce 2, it worked with default too and when i later tweaked it. maybe try the new nvidia driver or use "nvidia" instead of "nv" ?
Are you using the latest NVidia drivers? I seem to remember an issue with newer cards and older drivers.
This is a link to my Slack XF86Config file. You might want to comparee it to yours, or try it and see if it works for you.
Thanks guys. I don't have it working yet, but I will give it a shot. I decided to try out SuSE 9.1 because I was bored and now have broadband at home. I am going to image it to my other drive when done configuring it, and going and taking another whack at slack. I do say, 9.1 is already looking a lot better than 9 was. Christ, I actually have a stable system, as opposed to 9, right after the install all kinds of hell broke loose.
Its nice having broadband and storage ;D
Thanks again!
Do you have a USB mouse?
I just installed slack 9.1 and was having exactly the same issue. It didn't like the mouse. However when I was running the 2.6 kernel on my old slack 9.1 install it worked fine.
BookmarksHey guys, just picked up a LR-308 and i'm looking for anyone that has loaded for these before?

The HouseWays and Means Committee is expected to amend and vote Monday on a proposal to start the process of allowing table games in Maryland and a new casino in Prince George’s County. If the legislation passes both chambers, it would have to be approved by voters in a November referendum..
“It’s just going to depend on what the bill shapes up to be,” said House Majority Whip Talmadge Branch, a Baltimore Democrat and Ways and Means member. “There are still some things that have the committee somewhat uncomfortable and until some of those are changed, I think it’s 50-50.”
The House and Senate have failed to see eye to eye on casino legislation since this past spring’s regular session, when a Senate-backed bill died in the House because of concerns that a sixth casino would crowd the market and take business from the state’s other facilities — particularly the Maryland Live casino in Anne Arundel County and a planned casino in Baltimore.
Gov. Martin O'Malley, a Democrat, proposed legislation last week that would lower the current tax rates at the Anne Arundel and Baltimore casinos from 67 percent to 62 percent, and lower the rate for the existing Ocean Downs casino to 57 percent to cushion the blow from added competition.
Anne Arundel’s House members are still dead set against any expansion, said county delegation chairman Delegate Ronald A. George, Anne Arundel Republican.
He said that along with the increased competition from a Prince George’s facility, lawmakers have concerns about the percentages of revenue that go to counties. A planned gaming commission in the bill could have too much power, he said.
The commission would be appointed by the governor and could alter tax rates for the Anne Arundel and Baltimore facilities, although the General Assembly would have the power to override any changes.
Mr. George, who serves on Ways and Means, said the committee will approve its own version of the bill, but key stakeholders in the House will have the final say.
“It’s going to fall down to how many in Prince George’s and how many in Baltimore vote against the bill,” he said.
Delegate Curtis S. Anderson, Baltimore Democrat and chairman of his city’s House delegation, said city lawmakers are currently undecided on the bill but will support it if legislators allot a larger portion of the city’s casino revenue to school construction.
The Senate amended the bill last week to require that 5 percent of table games revenue from the Baltimore casino goes to city schools, which Mr. Anderson said is a good start.
“Our schools are in horrible shape. We haven’t had a school built in 20 years,” he said. “Under the right circumstances, the majority of the delegation would vote for it. I’m just waiting to see if those circumstances are met.”
While Anne Arundel and Baltimore lawmakers appear to be acting in relative unison, there is some discord among Prince George’s House members as some have stood firm against the proposal despite urging of support from County Executive Rushern L. Baker III.>I'm trying to know what does the SwishSpider do, but >there are some questions that I can't understand. >Does anybody know how it works step by step? >I'll be grated with you, if you answer.. moo At 01:39 PM 12/16/98 -0800, Ibon Aizpurua wrote: >This is a multi-part message in MIME format. > >------=_NextPart_000_0011_01BE2944.E756E860 >Content-Type: text/plain; >Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable > >Hello, > >thanks > Ibon Aizpurua > >------=_NextPart_000_0011_01BE2944.E756E860 >Hello,<BR>I'm trying to know what does the SwishSpider do, = >but<BR>there are=20 >some questions that I can't understand.<BR>Does anybody know how it = >works step=20 >by step?<BR>I'll be grated with you, if you=20 >answer.<BR><BR>thanks<BR> = > &= >nbsp; &n= >bsp; =20 >Ibon Aizpurua</DIV></BODY></HTML> > >------=_NextPart_000_0011_01BE2944.E756E860-- > > > ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Ron Klatchko - Manager, Advanced Technology Group UCSF Library and Center for Knowledge Management ron@ckm.ucsf.eduReceived on Wed Dec 16 14:20:25 1998Bennett, British Columbia, Canada is an abandoned town next to Bennett Lake.[1] Hotel, a combination saloon, restaurant and hotel by Friedrich "Fred" Trump, grandfather of American businessman and television personality Donald Trump.

After swalllowing down the last of my food and draining the orange juice, i rose to my feet, fixing my leather jacket. "Bye, Mag. I'll see you after school" I waved my hand before moving towards the door and opening it. With another small wave i walked out the door, shifting the weight of my backpack to one shoulder as i shut it behind me. My breath swirled before me as it touched the chilly air as i thought about the day ahead. Please don't let another incident happen again.... I thought, praying silently to anyone who was listening before walking down the windy pathway towards the school.

Friday, July 22, 2005. Just like old times, his name is once again all over town, in print and on the air.
Washington, it seems, can't get enough of the legendary gangster, which is why the story of Edmond's life, recounted in a new DVD docudrama, has been selling by the thousands since its release in Washington last week.
From Mad T Music Box on 14th Street NW to Kemp Mill Music in Marlow Heights, the DVD has been the hot entertainment item for the past 10 days in many corners of the District and Maryland.
Edmond is to Washington what John Gotti was to New York, an almost mythic figure whose fearless, flashy style fascinated even those who condemned him and the way he amassed his fortune.
"There are a lot of people that remember the Rayful Edmond story," said Carlton Tucker, owner of Mad T.
But unlike similar stories, Edmond's is one that has been little told. No book was ever written, and before now, no film was produced.
Yet his life, and the spectacular trial that changed it, were like nothing the city had ever seen, and 27-year-old director Kirk Fraser set out to chronicle it all in an entertaining but cautionary tale.
Until his arrest at age 24 in 1989, Edmond had controlled a sizable share of the drug trade in the District, bringing in millions of dollars of Colombian cocaine each week from Los Angeles. The city's streets were awash in cocaine, and Edmond was flush with cash. He spent lavishly on cars and clothing and clubbing. He would drop thousands of dollars in boutiques or nightspots without a second thought. Until he was done in by two of his closest associates.
Put on trial under unprecedented security, it was a daily spectacle. Jailed not in the District but at Quantico Marine Base, Edmond was flown to court each day by helicopter, his comings and goings broadcast on the evening news. For the first time in the city's history, the jurors were kept anonymous and worked from behind bulletproof glass.
The legend has endured among many who lived through those times, who say that good or bad, few people have had the impact on the city that Rayful Edmond did.
"He's a historic icon," Mark Williams, a 34-year-old federal government worker, said as he left Kemp Mill earlier this week after purchasing "The Life of Rayful Edmond: The Rise and Fall, Vol. I." "I remember in the '80s hearing the name, but I never really knew his whole story."Madonna, who's performing a new single at Super Bowl XLVI, has apparently signed a three-album deal with Interscope, according to Billboard.biz. This won't interfere with her 10-year multi-faceted contract with Live Nation that's reported to be worth at least $100 million. Instead, the Interscope deal gives her a base of $1 million for each of the three albums. Prior to this signing, she had been at Warner Bros. for some 25 years. She left that label following the release of her previous album, 2008's Hard Candy.It's not easy being Jurgen Klopp this week.
While Bayern Munich went about deconstructing Barcelona's tiki-taka empire Tuesday night in one UEFA Champions League semifinal, Klopp was trying to prepare his Borussia Dortmund for their own semifinal first leg Wednesday night against Real Madrid.
The problem is, Klopp must prepare his team while dealing with a distraction within it. If you hadn't heard, Bayern announced earlier this week that Mario Gotze, a 20-year-old attacking midfield prodigy who currently plays for Dortmund, is set to join Bayern in the summer.
Bayern met the €37 million release clause (via BBC Sport) in Gotze's contract, reportedly at the direction of incoming manager Pep Guardiola (formerly of Barcelona) and thus successfully poached Dortmund's brightest young star before he could fully blossom—and literally hours before BVB's big semifinal date with Real Madrid.
So how does Klopp feel about all this? Take a wild guess.
Normally known for his humor and wit in press conferences, Klopp showed a more intense side in Tuesday's pre-semifinal press conference.
"He is the player that Pep Guardiola absolutely wanted. That means that if anybody is to blame that he has decided to leave, it is me," Klopp said via a translator. "That said, I can't shrink 15 centimeters, learn Spanish, have them play world-switching football and preach tiki-taka—that is just not possible."
Ouch.
A clip from the press conference appears above. It's our Set Piece Video of the Day. Enjoy.
Klopp also said he heard about the deal the day after Dortmund beat Malaga with a dramatic late comeback in the Champions League quarterfinal second leg. Double ouch.
And in the Guardian's transcript of the press conference, Klopp is quoted as saying:
It could have been worse: it could have happened a couple of hours before the game..
Triple ouch. Three strikes and all that.
So how does this affect Dortmund ahead of Wednesday night's first leg? Will it be a distraction or bring Klopp's team together (sans Gotze, of course)?
We're half-expecting to see an on-field mutiny that ends with Gotze crumpled up in his own goal. But that's just us.Over at the SCEE Playstation Day in London, Kaz Hirai announced that LittleBigPlanet is finally going to makes its way onto consoles in October. Not only that, but Home is also due to be released towards the end of this year.
LittleBigPlanet has been in development by Media Molecule (the guys responsible for Rag Doll Kung Fu) for quite some time, and was officially announced at GDC 2007. The game mixes co-op platforming with a touch of Gary's Mod: players work through physics-based platforming puzzles with the help of their friends. An incredibly robust level creation and online sharing tool will ensure that the gorgeous game lasts well after release.
Home is, of course, Sony's social-networking service for the console, which many people see as a more polished version of Second Life; it was also announced at GDC 2007. "Our confidence in Home has not wavered... As great as it currently is, it needs a little more time," Hirai stated during the event. Those interested in testing out the software will eventually be able to register for the Home Beta here.

Now if I give you me this is how it's got to be
First of all I won't take your cheating on me
And who can I trust if I can't trust in you
And I refuse to let you play me for a fool
You said that we could possibly
Spend eternity, see that's what you told me
That's what you told me
Well if you want me
You have to be fulfilling of my needs
If you really want me baby
If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me
And call me baby
You said you want my love
And you got to have it all
But first there are some things you need to know
If you wanna live with all I have to give
I need to feel true love or it's got to end, yeah
I don't want you to get with me
And I get my heart hurt, please
I don't need the hurt, I don't need the pain
So before I do, give myself to you
I have to know the truth
If I spend my life with you

The Glossed.it tool is different from other tools, which become overcomplicated in their attempts at saving a lot of content, as the tool lets users save just the sentences that really strike them as interesting.
According to Cnet, users first need to sign up on the Web site: Glossed.it, and after doing that, they could simply drag the provided bookmarklet to their browser’s toolbar.
For saving anything worth a read later, a user could simply click the bookmarklet and then click the sentence they want to save.
After saving the content, they could review them on the Glossed.it Web site, where the clips would be displayed with a bit of context around them, and organized by month.
The saved content also provides a link to the original content, and a delete link, the report added. (ANI)

They believe that once the show is over, there's little left for the attention-craving wannabes.
"They give so much," said one insider. "The nation feeds off their emotions and efforts for months and then, puff! it's all over.
"So this year, the guys and girls on X Factor have got together and demanded that the show's producers put together a discount card for former contestants."
Ands it's not just X Factor stars who should benefit, they say. Shows like Britain's Got Talent should offer the same benefits and Big Brother's ex-housemates should get something similar.
"They're not asking much," the insider added. "How about money off dry-cleaning at Shetchleys, or photo-processing and accessories at Jessops or Snappy Snaps?
"McColl's, WH Smith, Gregg's - they could all be useful for these talent show alumni."The Vampire Diaries
Vampire Diaries Season 4 Spoilers: Nina Dobrev Wants Elena to Loosen Up
So much went down in Vampire Diaries Season 3, our heads are still spinning. In fact, Nina Dobrev (Elena Gilbert) thinks there was too much action and told The Insider she’s excited to see the show get more character-driven in Season 4. The actress also talked about the direction Elena is headed, and how her relationships with Damon (Ian Somerhalder) and Stefan (Paul Wesley) will (and won’t) change. Spoilers ahead!
For one thing, expect Elena to rely on both Salvatores as she transitions into a vampire. “She is leaning on both of the boys, and all her friends, in a big way for support,” says Nina. “Everyone helps her in different areas, but she's not very independent in the first part of the season. I think that'll come, but we're not there yet.”
She added, “Elena is still Elena in almost every single way, but there are definite changes. She's going in a different direction with the way she acts and what she does — I think people will be surprised by the shift."
One thing that will remain the same, however, is the romantic tension between Elena and both brothers. “There is a definite shift that makes it, in a lot of ways, very much like the triangle we saw in Season 1,” Nina explains. “But it's very different because, yes, the boys are still arguing and having differing opinions over how she should lead her newly vamped life. But while their arguments remain the same, her perspective is very different now that she’s a vampire.”
The scales tipped in Stefan’s favor at the end of Season 3, but who knows what will happen now that Elena is a fanged force to be reckoned with!

I leave Twitter open in my browser. I leave Facebook open as well. I will look up, and in the twitter tab the number of “tweets” has increased. A minute ago, I saw 5. Now I see 54. Refresh. All clear. Back to work. Look up again. 15.
I follow 446 people. Some are breweries. Most are people I do not know. They update me on their lives.
Is this process any different on Facebook? Every other second, the page refreshes. New updates. New information. 438 friends. Some are breweries. Some are people I do not know. Some play games online and let me know what is happening. Some confess. Some express frustration. Some make things up.
We’ve moved from the period of waiting for news (postal delivery/Charlie Brown in front of the mail box) to the period of only news. Our lives are news. Journalism experiences a crisis because it can no longer differentiate between what is and what is not news. When it tries to conflate the two, it gets entertainment. When we try and conflate the two, we get the update. “I’m doing this.” “I’m doing that.”
Barthes dreams “of a world which would be exempt from meaning.” The sharpest critics of the Web are those that tell us there is no meaning in these updates. Frivolous. Banter. Junk. Such are the adjectives chosen. The point of criticism, as Latour once noted, is to decode to a certain point, before conspiracy theory sets in. Typical critiques of the update end up quickly in conspiracy mode: the world is coming to an end. For similar reasons, Latour reminds us that critique has run out of steam.
A world exempt from meaning. Another way to read the update might be: it is a world exempt from meaning. There is no reason to read any meaning. I update. I am news. I am information. The content of any medium is always another medium. The content of me is the update.
Your post reminds me of the passage from Kittler about the buribunkers, people who would keep and publish comprehensive diaries of every moment of their lives. We’re all buribunking now.
Comment by Brendan — March 11, 2010 @ 10:51 amFlorida has posted the second-largest percentage drop in unemployment over the past year, trailing only New Mexico, according to a Bureau of Labor Statistics report out Tuesday.
Florida unemployment fell to 10 percent in November, down from 11.9 percent in November 2010. In the same period, New Mexico's jobless rate fell 2.1 percentage points, from 8.6 to 6.5 percent. Florida added a net 98,100 jobs over the past year, a tally behind only California (up 233,100 jobs) and Texas (up 226,000 jobs).
The improvement is not as good as it appears, however, because of Florida's population growth and the fact that thousands of Floridians have given up looking for work, at least temporarily, and are no longer counted among the jobless.
Florida remains one of just seven states with unemployment still in the double digits and remains far above the national average of 8.6 percent. Although Florida released its latest unemployment statistics last Friday, not all other states had reported before Tuesday.If you sit all day long while working, you know how your legs can become numb or heavy. Even though most of us know we should take breaks every 2-3 hours, we usually don't have the time to take a little walk during working hours (I usually can't).
But you don't have to leave the office, or not even your desk to incorporate an easy routine that keeps your legs healthy! Follow the illustrations right now and get going with these quick exercises. Don't forget to keep your abs flexed while holding your feet off the ground so your lower back is protected. (If you can take your shoes off, it's even better ;)
1. Pretend to pick something up from the floor with your toes and "let it go" midair. Do this 6-8 times.
2. Make circles with your feet while holding your legs straight in the air. Do it to both directions 6-8 times.
3. With straight legs flex your feet, hold it for a second than point your toes. Repeat 6-8 times.
4. Do the scissor movement with your legs straight. Yep, you guessed it already: repeat 6-8 times.
That's it! Do this series 2-3 times a day to get the maximum benefits. Doing these exercises on the long term can prevent varicose vein to form on your legs and it gives your muscles a well earned refreshment.

Location: San Diego, CA
Occupation: DJ/Producer
Afiliations: Freddiejoachim.com Melloworange.com
Background: Freddie Joachim (pronounced “JO-AH-KIM”), began his music career as a DJ in 1996. He started out as a mobile DJ in his hometown of San Diego, and for a while spent much of his time focused on being a battle DJ/turntablist. Since then, Freddie has become a DJ that spins and listens to an eclectic mix of genres, with a strong focus on hip-hop and jazz. In the Summer of 2010, Freddie released his third full-length album, “Midway,” which is a collection of instrumentals which Freddie wanted to show his range as a hip hop and soul producer. Midway was the first full-length artist album released on the San Francisco based label, Mellow Orange, a label established by Freddie, and good friend, Yusai. (Midway is available on iTunes, Amazon, CDBaby, Last.fm)
Whats on Freddie’s workspace:
1. CME UF5 49-key midi controller
2. Sony MDR-V700 headphones
3. M-Audio Trigger Finger Midi Pad Controller
4. Midway CDs
5. Computer
6. I-Phone
7. Hard drives
8. Rubix Cube
9. Girl Scout Chocolate Almonds
10. Canon 20D
AWKP: We are a big fan of your style of production. For the people that
are not in ‘the know,’ what would you label your style of music?
FJ: I would say my music is mellow and chill for the most part; jazz and soul with a few electronic elements. I like visiting both ends.
AWKP: You have CME UF5 midi controller and the M-Audio midi Pad
controller, is it really necessary to have both? Is one controller more useful than the other?
FJ: Well, I use the pads for mainly sample chops and drums. The other for more keyboard based, melodic stuff. The pads are definitely more portable than my main keyboard.
AWKP: Is it true that in a recording studio there should always be a good
set of headphones as well as studio monitors. Do you ever run your mix downs with just your headphones?
FJ: Yeah, it’s always good to have a nice pair of headphones present. I can never truly rely on headphones with mix downs. I use them when I’m in a pinch, but overall I need a pair of monitors.
AWKP: What is your take regarding beat machines vs. software based
programs? Is one better than the other?
FJ: In terms of time efficiency, I feel software is better. Well, faster anyway. Analog instruments definitely have characteristic sounds, a punchiness, and a warmness, which I feel software is very difficult in duplicating. I used to own a few samplers, mainly an MPC 2000xl, but never really utilized it because I found recording and editing on it was too slow for me. Sometimes working that slow can produce a great sound. Ultimately, I learned software was the best choice for the types of music I wanted to create.
AWKP: We understand that you are a sound engineer besides being a producer. In the movie Hustle and Flow, there were egg crates on the walls of Djay’s studio. When you first built your studio, did you have egg crates on your walls? Should someone without a budget for studio foam invest in egg crates?
FJ: No. I never believed in actual egg crates. I would say, try to have an understanding of how sound works, and what’s best for your sound and budget before deciding on putting any type of soundproofing up. You can buy some really nice stuff, but find out that it does nothing for “sound proofing” or not knowing exactly where to place it. You can put a bunch of egg carton crates up, but it might do nothing for your sound, and now you have ugly walls.
AWKP: At first glance, we noticed the Iphone but then you threw us off with the computer. We almost thought you were going to be an apple junkie like most of the other interviewees. Why the mix of *gasp* pc and apple combo?
FJ: I’ve always been a PC user. And just to spite everyone else, I may never switch to a Mac. Ha! No, really. There’s a lot of VST’s, plug-ins, and synths that I utilize, that aren’t available for Mac. Even though I don’t necessarily condone this, but you don’t have to pay for any software if you have a PC. Macs, PCs, they’re just tools.
AWKP: You also possess a few hard drives. Besides bootleg blockbuster movies, what else is saved on your hard drives?
FJ: Mainly Music. I have a hard drive just for music. My sequences and recordings take a lot of space. I have a few television shows such as “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia,” and “The Office.”
AWKP: Speaking of shows, I am a huge ‘The Office’ fan and am a little jealous that you own a Dwight bobblehead and I don’t. Do you feel that you possess some characteristics from the actor on the show? And when I say characteristics, I am not necessarily referring to his sinister ways but more of his drive and focus to be #1 and also the fact that he owns a beet farm.
FJ: Dwight characteristics? Probably none. Other than my extensive knowledge of “beets,” he was just my favorite character on the show. One Christmas, my buddy Kenny got it for me as a present. It also came with a Dunder Mifflin t-shirt.
D’Angelo – Left & Right (Freddie Joachim Remix) by freddiejoachim
AWKP: I used to have a Rubix Cube but I could only solve one side. Out of
frustration, I would disassemble all the blocks and lock it back into place correctly. Did you really solve the Rubix Cube or did you peel off the stickers and cheat? Is this your form of a stress reliever?
FJ: Solving the Rubix Cube is easy as pie…or pi…the way I learned, was just memorizing a few algorithms. Honestly, if you can remember a sequence of buttons to push in a video game, you can solve a rubix cube.
AWKP: Ok so this is an AWKP first. Girl Scout product on the workspace. When the opportunity is there, I usually pick up 5 boxes each of the caramel delight’s and peanut butter patties. You opt to run with these Chocolate Almond joints. Are we missing out on something here?
FJ: My niece is in Girl Scouts. I think they run the assorted nuts before thanksgiving. They’re pretty dangerous to have around. I think I’m the only one who doesn’t care for Thin Mints and Samoa Girl Scout cookies. Tagalongs all day!
AWKP: What producers currently inspire you? Is there anything in your Ipod on heavy rotation?
FJ: Currently, I’m listening to Hudson Mohawke, Nosaj Thing, Dorian Concept, Afta-1, Adriana Evans, Vikter Duplaix, Spinna, Dilla, Exile, Flying Lotus, Tokimonsta, and whole bunch more.
AWKP: The 20D is a really nice camera. We are hoping it’s not an expensive paper weight. Besides making beats, are you a closet photographer?
FJ: It was actually a hand-me-down from my dad. I also have a 7D but I’m not a photographer. I just like taking photos every now and then. Having a DSLR forces you to learn how to use it correctly and learn more about a camera and lighting.
AWKP: Midway is such a dope album. What solo projects can we expect from
you in the near future? Are there anymore collabs to come?
FJ: I’ll probably come out with a handful of new releases, mainly vinyl. I’m working on a couple soul artist’s albums but there’s a whole lot coming out from our label, Mellow Orange. We’ll keep everyone posted.
AWKP: Finally any last words, shoutouts or plugs?
FJ: Big thanks and peace to AWKP for this. Peace to Mellow Orange and Organology. My current album, Midway, is available everywhere (iTunes, Amazon, record shops, here and overseas) on digital, as well as a 2 cd digipak with a lot more music. We’ll have some vinyl on the way.

But now it’s filled with evil things. No matter how many are slain, more seem to come, as if called by some terrible nameless curse or power. It would take many a dwarf to clear these caves and tunnels out, though our small doughty group has done well, despite coming close to death several times now.
The dwarves who died here fill my heart with admiration and respect. True dwarves, all! They didn’t shrink from the sight of evil, they even seem to have sought out the dragon and succeeded in killing it. What a battle it must have been! And the quality of their forged steel – I have seen nothing to match it yet, save perhaps my own trusted axe.
I now ponder whether or not to notify the dwarves of Janderhoff of this place, but if I do, they must be warned of the great evil residing here.The first episode has managed to include all of the main characters of the show.
Hakudoshi: (to Kagura) Are you afraid of Naraku, now that it's time to act?
Kanna: As I pass through the lengthy struggle of life in this fleeting world, I cannot help but long for the midnight moon I once saw.
Kagome: (taking an exam) Focus... I'm close to solving this.
(Inuyasha enters the room and Kagome's pencil snaps)
Eri: I just heard something snapping.
Yuka: Wasn't that the sound of her concentration breaking?
Ayumi: That happens to everyone, sometimes.
Goryomaru: Make up your mind, Kagura. Will you die obedient to Naraku, or escape with me and obtain freedom?
Kagura: Freedom?
Kagura: Hey, Goryomaru, what the hell are you? Why did Naraku lock you away?
Hakudoshi: If you wish to know the answer, you should release Goryomaru.
In general the events of Season 8 (the final act) happen at a faster rate. It has taken about 35 volumes (350 scrolls or chapters) to reach the end of season 7, but season 8 covers volumes 36 to 56 (about 200 scrolls or chapters).
This episode is based on the events from chapters 359 to 360, along with part of 361, 362 367-373 part from volumes 37 and 38 of the manga.

BUFFALO -- Mercyhurst suffered a third-period collapse and fell 4-3 to Canisius on Saturday.
The Lakers' Daniel O'Donoghue got the game's first goal on a power play, but the Golden Griffins' Chris Rumble tied the game later in the opening frame.
Patrick Sullivan's unassisted goal gave Canisius a 2-1 lead early in the second period, but Nardo Nagtzaam responded with a goal for Mercyhurst 31 seconds later.
The Lakers took a 3-2 lead on Stephen Hrehoriak's short-handed goal, but it was all Golden Griffins in the third period as Braeden Rigney and Sullivan each tacked on a goal to secure the win. Kyle Just added two assists for Mercyhurst.
The Lakers will begin a three-game homestand Nov. 19 against Niagara.

The teacher also often maintains office hours at set times during the week to meet with students, and they must perform work outside classes to grade assignments and prepare lesson plans. The school year is normally divided into two semesters and several summer sessions, and postsecondary English language/literature teachers may instruct during any or all of these periods, and class sizes depend on the university and subject. This instructor must create class lessons and maintain a full semester of topics and assignments in the subject, and they also need to have a list of books and writings that the students need to read and write papers.
Postsecondary English language/literature teachers must have an advanced degree in their field; most of the time, this includes a Ph.D. in English literature. They must also have excellent teaching skills and the ability to work effectively with students to build understandings. They should be effective graders and be able to provide constructive comments and suggestions. These instructors also must continue their own education and to keep up with relevant and new issues related to their subject and education.

Lionsgate shareholder
Mark Cuban said Thursday that he will tender his shares to Carl Icahn, giving the activist investor new momentum in his attempt to grab control of the independent film studio.
Icahn holds 19 percent of the company’s stock, and says he has been tendered an additional 4 percent in his long-running takeover attempt. Adding Cuban’s 5 percent puts Icahn in the neighborhood of 28 percent.
If Icahn’s ownership stake surpasses 33 percent, a provision will be triggered that delivers $16 million worth of severance packages to the top five Lionsgate executives, including CEO Jon Feltheimer and chairman Michael Burns. Icahn then would have the power to veto any acquisitions.
Triggering that change-of-control default also would impact the company’s revolving credit, allowing lenders to demand accelerated repayment and straining the already maxed-out studio. Icahn has asserted that the default can be avoided if the lenders choose to waive it. It also can be circumvented if Lionsgate repays its debt.
Cuban indicated his intentions while being interviewed by CNBC’s David Faber early Thursday, saying, "I’m here to tell you I really think I"m going to tender and I will have a conversation with them today and most likely tender my shares."
When Faber asked him why, Cuban responded: "I have my reasons, I don’t want to get into, but I think it’s the right move for right now and the right move for the long term … for the company and for me."
Icahn’s lawyer, Keith Schaitkin, told TheWrap "I wouldn’t comment beyond what I’m reading publicly."
Icahn’s current $7-per-share offer to acquire Lionsgate expires June 16.
"If [Cuban] does tender his shares at $7 per share, we think he is leaving money on the table," a Lionsgate spokesman said.
According to one official close to Lionsgate, the studio has consulted analysts that peg its value at $8.85 per share. It has been trading right around $7 of late.
According to the Market Folly blog, Cuban in April filed a 13D with the Securities and Exchange Commission revealing a 5.4% ownership stake in Lionsgate Entertainment with 6,369,315 shares.
Cuban also %.
Icahn’s company recently announced that after the current offer expires, there will be a subsequent offering period from June 17 to June 30, in order to permit additional tenders. The price paid will be the same as that in the current offer.
Icahn and Cuban have some history together, with the former nominating the latter for the Yahoo! board of directors in 1998.Lime-Soaked, Cumin-Crusted Grilled Skirt Steak
From Splendid Table
Ingredients:
2 pounds skirt steak
1 cup fresh lime juice (about 8 limes)
For the Rub:
3 tablespoons cumin seeds (or 1 1/2 tablespoons ground cumin)
2 tablespoons minced garlic
1/3 cup roughly chopped fresh cilantro
Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper to taste
For the Relish:
1/2 cup finely chopped pitted green olives
1 teaspoon chopped dried red chile peppers of your choice, or to taste
1/4 cup olive oil
2 tablespoons freshly cracked black pepper
Instructions:
1. Place the steak in a shallow dish and pour the lime juice over it. Cover the dish and let it sit in the refrigerator for 30 minutes to 1 hour, turning occasionally.
2. Light a fire in your grill.
3. In a small bowl, combine all the rub ingredients and mix well. Remove the steak from the marinade, pat dry with paper towels, and rub it all over with the spice rub, pressing gently to be sure it adheres.
4. When the fire has died down and the coals are hot (you can hold your hand 5 inches from the grill surface for 1 to 2 seconds), place the steak on the grill and cook until well-seared on one side, about 4 minutes. Turn and continue to cook to the desired doneness, about 4 minutes more for rare. To check for doneness, nick, peek, and cheat: Make a 1/4-inch cut in the thickest part of the meat and take a peek; it should be slightly less done than you like it. Remove the steak from the heat, cover it loosely with foil, and allow it to rest for 5 minutes while you make the relish.
5. In a medium bowl, combine all the relish ingredients and mix well.
6. Slice the steak as thin as possible against the grain and serve with the relish.

By Lorne Chan - Express-News : July 1, 2010
Quincy Miller stood on the medal podium, shouting along to the “Star-Spangled Banner” as loud as he could.
He never celebrated a game-winning shot like this before, and few ever will.
Miller's 3-pointer got Team USA to the top of the podium, as the Americans avoided an upset with an 81-78 victory against Brazil in the FIBA Americas U18 Championship on Wednesday.
Team USA won the gold on Miller's three from the right corner with 25 seconds left.
“It was the best feeling in the world to hit that shot,” Miller said. “Ain't no feeling next to that.”
Team USA trailed by as much as nine in the fourth quarter before coming back in front of 2,100 fans at Greehey Arena.
After four tournament games where Team USA's average margin of victory was 49.5 points, the final was a much tougher fight.
Brazil led 35-34 at halftime and was ahead for much of the second half.
Behind Kyrie Irving's 21 points and Austin Rivers' 19, Team USA was able to hold off the South Americans.
“I'm glad that these guys went through this,” Team USA coach Jeff Capel said. “I'm glad we had to fight through adversity. I'm glad we had to fight together and stuck together. That's why you could see how proud they were.”
Brazil was led by 7-foot center Lucas Nogueira, who had 22 points and 14 rebounds.
Nogueira is under contract with a Spanish professional team, and Capel called him “the best pro prospect in the tournament.”
He dominated inside, while guard Felipe Vezaro added 17, and guard Raul Neto scored 11.
Brazil had trailed 15-2 to start the game but took over once it switched to a zone defense in the second quarter.
The Americans could only make 1 of 12 shots in the final 6:29 of the second quarter, as a 13-point lead turned into a halftime deficit.
“I came here for one reason and that was to win gold,” Rivers said. “At halftime, I was more anxious to get back out there than anything.”
Vander Blue scored 11 of his 13 points in the third quarter to get Team USA off to a big second-half start, but Brazil wouldn't go away.
Tied 78-78 in the final minute, Miller had been struggling for much of the game. His previous shot in the fourth quarter was also a 3-pointer from the right side, but that was an airball.
Miller's confidence was unshaken when he took a pass from Blue and buried the game-winner.
“I was going to make the next one,” said Miller, who finished with 11 points. “Shooters shoot, you know what I mean?”
Brazil had three shots in the final 25 seconds, as Nogueira picked up another offensive rebound, his ninth of the game. Its last shot, a 3-pointer by Bruno Irigoyen with one second left, missed the rim as time expired.
Irving, a Duke signee who also had 10 rebounds, led the crowd in a chant of “U-S-A! U-S-A!” after the victory.
His first call was to Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski after the victory.
“I told him I was expecting this to be a hard-fought game,” Irving said. “The feeling's a lot sweeter coming back. I can't even put it into words, it just feels great.”There are currently no items in your cart.

Pontiac (Mich.) Northern's Martell Webb has a little dilemma and the Michigan coaching staff is happy to work the problem with him. At 6-5 and 210 pounds, Webb is suited to play wide receiver or tight end in college. The issue is, he could be a standout at either position. Instead of choosing, however, Michigan is prepared to maximize his effectiveness.Webb was in Ann Arbor this past weekend for his official visit and spent a good deal of time talking with Michigan offensive coordinator Mike DeBord.While Butler would appear at the outset to be the model Michigan would follow with Webb, it is actually freshman wide receiver Greg Mathews whom DeBord told the future Wolverine to study. ...More...

By the end of May, more than 20 people including three police officers had been killed and 200 injured in brutal mob attacks in Bungoma and Busia counties in the west of Kenya. Some of the victims were left permanently blind.
Frustrated by the slow response from police, some residents of Bungoma formed vigilante groups to protect their property and loved ones.
According to Moses Wetangula, a member of the Kenyan Senate from the area, 600 people have been arrested in connection with the attacks in Bungoma and Busia.
A further 22 people were reported killed in similar attacks in Mandera county in the northeast on June 22 and 23.
The violence comes at a time when a new devolved system of government is taking shape in Kenya, with the aim of transferring powers from national to county level. The county governors, elected in March, are part of the new structure.
NAIROBI RETAINS SECURITY CONTROL
Kenya's national police force currently operates under a single command structure headed by the inspector-general in Nairobi. County governors therefore have no authority to call out the police when violence flares up. Their remit is limited to chairing the county policing authority, a local body which monitors security threats but has no direct powers to deploy forces.
Speaking after the attacks in Bungoma in May, county governor Kenneth Lusaka told IWPR, "If I had the powers over security, the response would have been swift and we would have saved more lives and property."
Lusaka believes that locally-elected representatives are in a better position to handle security matters than the inspector-general of police in Nairobi.
The county policing authority, he said, was "merely an oversight body", and genuine decision-making was hampered by its broad range of members, from the general public to NGOs and community organisations.
Senate member Catherine Mukiite is in favour of granting governors more powers over the police.
"Devolution functions seem not to have taken place," she said. "When the security team was sent from Nairobi [after the attacks], the Bungoma governor was not allowed to attend the security meeting."
OVERLAPPING ROLES
The county governors' role is further confused by the continuing presence of county commissioners who are not elected, but appointed by and answerable to the president.
These commissioners exist to implement the functions of national government at county level. That includes security, so the commissioners chair the county security committee, a separate body from the county policing authority. They have powers to order a police deployment, in consultation with the force's national command.
The county governors, meanwhile, do not sit on the security committee.
Governors are democratically elected to run their county yet, in effect, county commissioners can go over their head or not consult them on security matters. Mukiite believes this undermines their authority.
"One wonders who is in charge," she said. "I believe the response [to the Busia and Bungoma] killings would have been faster if the police were to answer to the governors."
County commissioners were declared unconstitutional by a high court ruling last year. But on June 14 this year, that decision was overturned by Kenya's Court of Appeal, and the commissioners were officially reinstated, although they never actually left their posts.
Governors have criticised the position of county commissioner, since it is accountable to central government rather than to them. Several of them even threatened to boycott celebrations of Kenya's home rule anniversary on June 1 unless the blurred responsibilities between them and the county commissioners were resolved.
The question of what security powers the governors should have was hotly debated when devolution legislation - the National Coordination Act and the National Police Service Act in particular - were drawn up in 2011.
Mukiite argues that keeping security in the hands of central government has left the new governors in an invidious position, since it makes them look like "mere figureheads".
"The voters do not want the governor to pass the buck, yet the same governors have no powers," Mukiite said.
"The people are wondering what the [role of the] governor whom they elected is."
COULD DEVOLVED SECURITY POWERS BE MISUSED?
The idea that county governors should control policing does not have universal support. Its opponents cite reasons ranging from the risk of confusing the lines of command to the danger that the police might end up being used to settle local scores. Others say it is too early to make changes to a structure that was laid out only recently, by the 2010 constitution.
Simiyu Werunga, director of the African Centre for Security and Strategic Studies, argues that if governors had more authority over the police, this might create a command structure operating in parallel with the police force's own hierarchy. The result could be blurred lines of command and lack of accountability.
"If we give the security role to the governor, we shall be decentralising the command structure, which is not good and could compromise the very security we envisage to keep," Werunga said. Our system is not a federal system. We only have devolved functions. If we had a federal system like Nigeria or the US, then the governors and mayors would be in charge," he said.
There is also an argument that national government should not cede its core function - maintaining domestic security - to any lower institution.
Stephen Mutoro, chairman of the Decentralisation and Governance Non-State Actors' Network, said while devolving other functions was beneficial, security must be controlled from the centre.
He warned that security could be at risk from devolved control, particularly when local elections were held.
"Governors themselves could be the problem and if this happens, say, in a county of two rival communities, I don't see the possibility of the governor deploying the security to arrest the situation, especially if members of his ethnic group are the aggressors," Mutoro said.
Others dispute such arguments. George Musamali, a security analyst and retired military officer, believes governors should play a more prominent role in security matters and have powers to deploy the police as a matter of democratic principle.
"These governors were voted for across the board, even in counties where there are communities perceived to be rivals," Musamali said. "Therefore claims that the governors could support one side are mere excuses to exclude them from security committees."
Bryan Kahumbura, an analyst with the International Crisis Group in Nairobi said it was "concerning" that the question over the governors' roles and responsibilities was being raised, since these should have been clearly articulated and understood prior to their election.
He says the constitution allows control over security to be devolved to governors, and decisions to do so could by made on a county-by-county basis as the need arises. At the same time, while the idea of giving governors more powers over the police has merit, Kahumbura said it might be a little premature to do so right now.
"It wouldn't be helpful at this stage," he told IWPR. "In theory they [governors], being the CEO of the county, should have such powers, but as it's a transition [period] and overall security control and instruction comes from central government, it could potentially be counter-productive in the short term."

There’s suddenly an influx of messenger apps in the market. But there’s nothing like having an Indian app to add that special touch – and Gupshup does just that.
There’s suddenly an influx of messenger apps in the market. But there’s nothing like having an Indian app to add that special touch – and Gupshup does just that.
GupShup which is more famous for its group messenger services has come up with a new app for iOS, Android and BlackBerry devices. The new app acts as a regular messenger app and let’s users connect with each other over instant messaging. The app also allows users to share media files and images. Group messaging is an added feature of the app.
The above features sound very regular and mundane, nothing different from what’s already in the market. However, GupShup does have some unique features too. Unlike traditional apps, where users can chat only if even the other person is on the same app, GupShup removes that one need. Users can chat with just about anyone using the app – whether they too have the app or not. How does this work? If you try sending a message to someone who does not use GupShup, GupShup data servers automatically convert it to an SMS and send it. Isn’t that cool?
But what about the response? GupShup has that figured out too. The reply does not reach as an SMS but is once again converted into the data format and is sent to the sender’s GupShup chat window! Also, the charges for the receiver to send the message are not premium but standard SMS charges (depending on the individual’s messaging plan).
There is a glitch to the technique though. The SMSes do not go if the other person has DND (Do Not Disturb as mandated by TRAI) and the sender gets a pop-up stating that the other person’s DND is activated. There is a way out for this. The minute the sender gets the pop-up, att he same time an SMS is sent to the other person stating that User 1 would like to chat with him and using the way provided, the receiver can choose to de-activate DND just for GupShup! Isn’t that cool?
Another feature we liked is the ability to create and send your own emoticons. India is the hub of expressions and what better way to emote than through your own, custom emoticons?
We think it’s the perfect Indian app!Getting Involved

These pseudo academic courses will hopefully fall by the wayside as the commercial reality of spending £9k a year for a degree kicks in. I remember years ago laughing at an American institution offering 'degrees' in Car park Management...
Are there no checks that can stop such institutions from fleecing students for a worthless bit of paper?
@Mr X before making unjust comment about the university course do some research, the course contains all the same core studies a degree in Business at any other Uni would offer.
The difference is that this course will give people an industry related qualification which means they will come out with a degree that not only takes them into the world of business but also gives them an edge on all the other business students.
i am a student looking to go to Uni this year and i have applied to both UCFB and Durham, I’m picking UCFB over Durham, because of the UCFB unique qualification which will propel me into the business world.
Ps. UCFB are only charging 6k a year which is dirt cheap compared to every other uni is the land.

Another issue of "slumlords" offering "shelter" for "migrant" workers.... Bet if the INS showed up out there, they would find most, if not ALL of the "migrant" workers are here illegaly....
But we wouldnt want to enforce "imigration" issues, that would be "racial profiling"...
Just ask the Ramos's, they will tell.*Warning: A post filled with new year clichés.
Happy New Year...
...Only (47) days late. I think I have offically developed into the world's worst blogger. I know my posts have been a little sporadic these past few months, but I miss blogging so much and I'm determined to get back on track. . 2013, was a mixed year for me. I started a new job, made lots of new really good friends and found a really special man in my life. It had its ups and had its downs, but I want to make 2014 my year(*).
January is well and truly over and we're half way into February so it's time to make the most of 2014 and do everything that I have on my list.
1) Pass my driving test
2) Get back to the gym and my pre-Christmas weight
3) Go on holiday
4) Get an extra part time job to save for a car
5) Get back into education
What new year goals did you make and any you've stuck to this far?

>> Get a load of this Prairie Dog. I got to get a screen graph of that, if I just function alt, ah it's over. Did you ever wish there was an easy way to take a screen graph of a video that's playing on your screen? Well, I'm Molly Wood from CNET.com and on this edition of Insider Secrets; I'm going to show you a media player that lets you do just that. ^M00:00:22 [ Music ] ^M00:00:30 Welcome to Gome Media Player. I like to call it balm, but I think I'm the only one. It's pronounced Gome. Anyway, Gome Media Player had the ingenious idea to build the video capture capability right into the video player. Now you should now, it does only work with downloaded videos that you're playing inside the media player, so I'm not going to get any screen graphs of the Prairie Dog today. But let's check out how it works. Open the player and then open this control panel. Now under the video tag, you'll see several options for taking screen shots. Simply click the screen capture button while the video plays and the player will save your still frame in a folder. Now you'll have to remember to rename the video in the folder yourself unless you're really good at remembering file names by their time and date stamp. Now you don't even have to settle for plain old what you see is what you get shots. This pan and scan feature right here has three zoom modes and three stretch modes that slightly tweak the video dimensions. Okay, now this video is too dark to make a decent screen graph, but I can lighten the image by adjusting the sliders that control brightness and contrast. See, now that will make nice desktop wallpaper. So you think I'm kidding but Gome can do that too. This advanced capture tool is a portal to plenty of program extras including this one right here, setting a screen shot as wallpaper. This is also where you access the image directory to change those file names into something you might actually recognize. You can also set or adjust the image quality you want out of the screen shot. Then there's neat little thing called burst capture, which takes shots of ten frames over the course of a second. Ah yes, this one is perfect. For CNET.com, I'm Molly Wood. ^M00:02:08 [ Music ]The Great Movies$1.99

WOODSTOCK — Strip clubs and other adult businesses soon may need an entertainment license from McHenry County, in addition to a special-use zoning permit, before opening for business.
The County Board's Liquor and License Committee voted unanimously Monday to recommend that the county adopt an adult-entertainment license ordinance. The committee expects the full County Board to consider the recommendation at Tuesday's board meeting.Well folks, we’re about to say goodbye to another year and I can’t think of a better way to ring it in than with a new banner! You know I like to update things now and then, and just the other day we finished a big citrus story at the studio for ourselves (yes, self-assignments are important!) and as I was looking around at the bowls of lemons and oranges I thought it’d make a bright happy new banner. Full confession: I’ve resorted to bright bowls of lemons before for my header banner. I just can’t help it. Clearly I’m not above repeating myself.
This year I thought of doing something a bit different using some of my favorite ceramics from Mud Australia. Yes, I’ve also been on quite an Australian kick. At any rate, I painted a surface a very light blue and arranged the assorted blue bowls from our collection.
WOULD YOU LOOK AT THOSE BLUES? I’m drooling. After I had them where I wanted them I placed some happy little lemons, oranges, kumquats and leaves inside them and snapped away.
I opened everything in photoshop to make sure it was where I needed it to be. I updated the type for 2012 and voila! done!
From me and Adam to you and your family….we are wishing you a very happy and healthy 2012! What a year it’s been!
Love the new banner; fresh, clean and inviting. Also love being able to see behind the scenes!
Love it! So jealous of all that blue Mud-ware. It’s so beautiful, especially with the pops from the citrus.
Looks amazing…can I pay you to make me one?! In all your spare time, of course.
Not joking, not one bit
Those bowls are beautiful and the fruit is so perfect in them. I LOVE the behind the scenes footage…Awesome!
stunning! I love to see ‘behind the scenes’ work, and what I would give for that … ‘tripod’ contraption!
I love Mud Australia, too. beautiful blues you have!
Happy New Year to you and Adam!
New banner is so clean and fresh – I loved your old one too! Your work is such a pleasure to follow. Happy New Year to you!
New banner is so clean and fresh – I loved your old one too! Your work is such a pleasure to follow. Happy New Year to you!
HAPPY NEW YEAR, my beloved friend. You, like that blue, are a perfect shade of happy and joyful. Adore you and your new banner. Happy 2012. May it be filled with even more fun, travel, frolicking, and….wigs.
Happy 2012! The new banner looks amazing, though I am sad to see the rustic-y old one go!
Lovely, fresh and so colorful.
Best wishes for 2012!
Cheers,
Rosa
I love the new banner! So clean and fresh (though I miss seeing your pretty face up there).
Of course, now I want to eat a blood orange. Or as my friend Ben likes to call them, bloody oranges.
Enjoyed reading this. I loved the old hand-written font though! Have a great 2012.
Matt, your work is beyond inspiring. Love seeing behind the scenes like this (the results are rockin’ too!). There’s something inspiring about a bowl of bright, fresh, citrus fruits, so repeat away! Happy New Year!
Will, coming from you this is the highest compliment ever! A very happy new year to you!
Simon, the handwritten font will still be around in some posts, I could never exclude it completely!
Thank you Irvin! The world might be seeing too much of my face in 2012 so I thought I’d give everyone a break… who knows
And happy new year to you and AJ!
Blue! You had me at blue. Looks lovely. Hope you have a happy, healthy, delicious bite-filled year and put that banner to good use.
I think you need to add some cocktails in there too
Looks great, as always! x, Rebecca
It’s beautiful! Happy New Year, Matt & Adam!
My wife sent me a link to this article. Great banner and behind the scenes information. While this is my first visit to your site it will not be my last. I have already added your feed to my reader.
Matt, It looks beautiful! A very happy new year to you and Adam–may your days be filled with the same beauty and clarity of that gorgeous blue!
Beautiful citrus and a beautiful banner! I’m inspired to play with some avocados now! Happy New Year, Matt!
Wow, Matt, this is really beautiful! I love that pale blue with a hint of grey in it. Everything goes so well together, inviting fruit beckoning for a bite and the stunning ceramics from Mud Australia!
What a way to greet the new year! Happy New Year!
It’s bright and beautiful. It makes me want to rush home to create some citrus cordials… Happy new year!
Happy New yEar to you and Adam Matt! Hugs from Kent and me. YOu’ve had an amazing 2011 and we know that 2012 holds many wonderful adventures, blessings and surprises for you. Love the citrus header! Of course, I’m crazy about citrus so it’s a natural choice for me. Our trees are heavy with fruit right now. Can’t wait to do something with it all. Love the process photos too. Thanks my friends!
Matt, you never fail to inspire me in so many levels. I love your work. Thank you for being around. More love to you and Adam.
Love love love the new banner and type! Cokes!
Just gorgeous! And yes, those blues are drool worthy!
Love the new banner, it’s so fresh and so clean!!! Happy New Year to you and Adam!!
Sweet! Got the lighting just right too. I like.
LOVE the new banner! Fresh, clean, and modern.
Best wishes for 2012!
Cheers, prost, and salud.
Love the banner!! Happy new year 😀
Hi there Matt, delighted to have found your blog and just linked to it on my site. Have a wonderful 2012!
Simply gorgeous! I love your photography and design skills and hope to reach that level some day. Any suggestions for a food blogger in a small NYC apartment?
Matt, You are really awesome. I am a big fan for your photography now. Loved to see the scenes and hard work behind an excellent photograph. Thanks for the info and Happy new year too..
Happy New Year Matt! Your new banner is gorgeous – really evokes the freshness of the season here in California. Thanks for sharing your process in producing it, it’s always great to get that sort of insight. Definitely going to check out Mud Australia as well!
Wow, I didn’t realize so much went into a good photo. Great imagination, keep it up!
Love the colour palette of the new banner. So fresh and clean…wonderful. Happy New Year!
I love the new banner… Looks beautiful! Thanks for the inspiration!
Yay! A new banner for a great new year. Really love it & the Mud bowls too.
& inspiration.

Never owned or used a "speed feed" stock on a shotgun, and can't really conclude whether they are a problematic addition to a working gun or not. I don't like things hanging off a working gun (I don't personally feel a need for two sets of sights co-witnessed, with a laser and a flashlight at this point). Is a speed feed stock easier to use in practice than a receiver mounted side saddle shell holder? As a last ditch method I only wear pants that have pockets. Thoughts appreciated. DonWASHINGTON—A standoff between Republicans and the Obama administration over a botched gun-trafficking operation escalated Wednesday, with a House committee voting to hold Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt of Congress..
The Road to Contempt.
Executive-Privilege Declarations by Presidents in the Past 50 Years
John F. Kennedy
Directed his military adviser, Gen. Maxwell Taylor, to refuse to testify before a congressional committee examining the botched Bay of Pigs operation.
Lyndon B. Johnson
On three occasions, Johnson administration officials refused to comply with congressional committee requests for information.
Richard Nixon
Claimed executive privilege three times to fight release of White House tapes during Watergate. He lost in court. Before that, he had asserted the privilege three times. First, he directed his attorney general to withhold FBI reports from a committee in 1970. A year later, his secretary of state asserted the privilege to withhold information from Congress about military assistance programs. It was asserted again to prevent a White House adviser from testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding a nominee for attorney general in 1972.
Gerald Ford
Directed Secretary of State Kissinger to withhold documents during a congressional investigation of covert activities in 1975.
Jimmy Carter
Ordered his energy secretary to claim executive privilege after a committee demanded documents relating to a policy to impose a petroleum import fee.
Ronald Reagan
Asserted the privilege three times—in an investigation of Canadian oil leases, in an inquiry about the EPA's pollution enforcement practices, and at nomination hearings for William Rehnquist to withhold memos written by him years earlier when he was a lawyer at the Justice Department.
George H.W. Bush
Asserted the privilege once, in 1991, ordering his defense secretary not to comply with a demand for document in an investigation of cost overruns of a Navy aircraft program.
Bill Clinton
Because he didn't issue written directives asserting privilege, he didn't make it completely clear when he was asserting the privilege. He is generally regarded to have asserted the privilege 14 times, including four times in the face of grand-jury demands for documents.
George W. Bush
Asserted the privilege six times, beginning with a denial of documents in an inquiry into the FBI's mishandling of informants in Boston. He asserted it again in 2007 when a congressional investigation sought the testimony and papers of two senior aides, Harriet Miers and Joshua Bolten over the removal of U.S. Attorneys.

Write to Evan Perez at evan.perez@wsj.com still MUCH cheaper in China proper.
I prefer my suits to be made by child slaves in China!
I meant to say in my earlier post (i clicked post by accident) that i have been working with a great tailor named David ("Weeb") and he has the best value in the NYC-tri state area that i have seen. i think he also has clients in the PA and Chicago area. the thing i like best about him is he also knows about fashion. i used a HK tailor and he was pretty good, but he didn't really have the best fashion sense and sometimes i got lost in all the fabric options. Weeb knows his stuff and has a wider range of price points. Check him out.
Vanity has no limits for some. What a total waste of money to spend thousands on a suit.
Go in Naples,tailors are excellent and prices more reasonable.About fabric,Zegna is the best.
I can make my own suit using the same wool and I know it will fit me better.
What I found interesting in the article was how cost of the fabric was driving everything. Please tell the FED that inflation IS here. The taylors were having to renegotiate their wages because of the high cost of living.
rtfontenot: the tailors mentioned in this article are based in China.
Seriously?! Who would spend that much on one suit - and WHY???
I can understand wanting high-quality clothing that looks good, but how on earth do they justify prices in the thousands of dollars for each suit? If it takes 50 hours to make one of the fully-lined suits, you'd be paying the tailor $100 per hour for a suit costing $5,000. How many tailors - even good ones - make that kind of money (or expect to)?
there are a lot more wealthy folks in china who are bidding up the price of top tailors and premium wools. Like many finite materials, better wool is subject to dramatic swings in price.
i don't think the prices are THAT crazy. A lot of it has to do with the quality of fabric. and of course with certain fabrics you're paying something for the label. The important thing is to get good value product that FITS RIGHT. a $5,000 suit that doesn't fit you will look like crap next to a $600 suit that fits well.
Stefano, i agree, that Zegna is one of the best. that website that john posted has most of the labels listed mentioned in this article (Zegna, VBC, Loro Piana). i'm gonna check em out and see what the prices are. and VBC is REALLY nice stuff... a little better than "good" as this article says.
Sarah, the bulk of the cost is the fabric...do you have any idea what 1 yard of vicuna costs? I can assure you a Hong Kong Tailor is lucky to get $25/hour with many years of experience.
I think that the prices are high, and going to tay that way. I don't expect that things in the economy are going to get better really soon. And I think we are just starting to REALLY see that.
How does the saying go...'an ounce of gold will buy you a good suit'?
Time to reflect.
Yes, prices have risen in Asia but compare that to savile row in London and it still a massive saving.
Very nice article. Check us out if you are in the market for custom tailoring. The Dave that John mentioned has mentored me for the last several years. He is a great guy too. We also carry the Zegna, VB, Loro Piana, etc, fabrics. Executive Packages starting at $595.00. We will also travel to see clients.
Dress Well,
Marco
getstitched@stitchedonline.com
Prices have risen - but not to the extent that it impacts THAT much on the overall costs.
An example: a pair of jeans that would cost 10£ before, will not cost 10.40£ IF the retailer/tailor hands on the raise of the cost for fabrics.
But has happened though is that the raise in price reflects the lost cotton harvests across the world - hence it is more difficult to come by quality material in first place - at least as far as cotton is concerned.
However, if it where for wool, and even only looking at 'western' countries - there are massive quantities still to have basically for free (the fleece that is). A lot of the wool produced by the sheep in Australia and/or New Zealand as well as the UK, Ireland etc. in fact is burnt, because it's more expensive to have it transported to a buyer than what they get for it as price!
Bottom line: You need to know the workings and background to know what you're talking about ...
Great article, but the point that a lot of end consumers of wool forget is that this product has to be produced by people that are often having to sell wool far below what it costs them to produce. Wool is a beautiful, sustainably produced fibre that should be sold on its style and price point but more importantly for its other attributes that are so often forgotten- sustainability, fire retardant, water resistant(will keep you warm even when wet) and ability to prevent smell from body odor transfering into fabric and its contribution to rural economies all over the world.
thanks for explaining to people that costs of production are rising, but i think you have missed the main point that many fabric producers (both cotton and wool) have not only had rises in theirs production costs lately but are only now getting compensation for what it has always cost them. Just because prices have been low does not mean to say that farmers have been producing wool for less, they have just had to accept less money.
i totally agree with Pamela
The cost of commodities such as cotton and wool will continue to be on the rise, and it will be interesting to see how that will affect where apparel is produced. If the price of manufacturing clothing, custom or designer, goes up, there will be a shift. Hopefully this will create some balance in the manufacturing market.
It sickens me that the writer uses the term "bespoke" when referring to asian-made suitS. It does the tailors on Savile Row a huge injustice...
NRT, that may be the case for most suits in Asia but some are actually well made. WW Chan's suits are often better finished than some on the row.
SevenUp and Champagne have both bubbles, but its not the same thing
W.W. Chan has a great brand name and when you go to their trunk shows in NYC, they come across as very client friendly. I ordered a suit that cost more 2k usd. After 3 or 4 wears, the pants split down the middle, not just the stitching. All embarrassment aside, when I called them up to talk to them the first thing I was told was that it will cost me 700 usd to replace those pants. When I expressed my displeasure , they gave me an offer of 300 usd replacement charge and said this is a "special offer" or take a hike.
In between I had placed an order of 2 more suits, which I have cancelled, and am following up with my credit card co. I highly doubt I will get a refund, but will never do business with such establishments who rip off their clients.

PLEASE READ THIS AND HELP. I have no idea what I'm going to do and what I should do? I need an outside opinion.
A couple of months ago we got new neighbors. Fine. Well they have a child that's not the same race as they are. Fine too. The thing is ... they seem a little weird. Little boy cries a lot in the morning. They're super permissive with him (i.e. lets him run around on balcony naked. he's about 4? screams and cries as if he's younger) Anyway ... it's not my style but still wasn't a huge concern.
The thing is there's been a handful of abductions around the area. All involving the same colored car they have. And today there was a new one matching a couple letters on the license plate.
They've just always given me an "off vibe." Can't explain WHY ...they just did.
Just to let you know I'm not the type of call CPS and get the police involved needlessly. I don't do this.... it just doesn't seem right. Then again what if it's not? I don't want to put innocent people through this ...
So what do you think? Call it in or shrug it off?
***EDIT***
So I posted this about a week ago, and haven't heard a thing since. No abductions, no cops ... no nothing.
Yesterday me and my SO spoke with the neighbor for the first time, and he gave both of us the creeps. Does wear glasses, by the way ... and always has a change of clothes with him. Just ... strange. After he brought the boy in he went back down to the car to bring in some bedding. Just kinda strange, because I was under the assumption that he works all day and the child stays at home with the woman.
But anyway ... the kid was naked and on the back deck in less than 15 minutes. He's 4 ... probably closer to 5. And he won't tell my kids his name when he asks.
Just strange. I've been kinda researching, but nothing has came up.
Kinda sucks though because the vibe they give off makes me feel very uncomfortable in my own home. I mean ... even when we have guests over the child is running around on his balcony barefoot (it's wooden and probably old. Wouldn't dare walk on it barefoot :-/) and usually naked. He's always dressed in sort of ratty clothes ... and rides a girl's bike.
Which is fine and dandy by me, just not what I would expect with the child being adopted. I'm not really familiar with that sort of thing though ...
Advice? Help? Hell ... tell me that I'm being a crazy bitch, PLEASE, if you see no reason to be concerned. I just can't shake off th feeling!
I'd call for more details to see if there's any other similarities etc

- BreefullyMe87IT was a case of quality over substance at St Conleth’s Park, Newbridge last Sunday as Kildare made it back-to-back wins which booked a Kehoe Cup final meeting against Meath in Navan this weekend, writes John Ryan.
Kehoe Cup Semi Final
Kildare: 2-16
Derry: 0-13
The Lilywhites, fresh from their facile win in Louth seven days previous, struggled however for long spells of the first half to exert themselves on an opposition who brought plenty of endeavour and workmanship to the table.
Even though there was an over-reliance on centre-forward, Rory Convery who pointed six of Derry’s nine first half scores, the sides were level on four occasions during that same period as the Oak Leaf men’s in-your-face approach frustratingly stifled their hosts.
On the balance of it Willie Sunderland’s Kildare created far and away more of the chances, some of which were goal opportunities, and while they squandered a few – seven wides, four from frees – a second goal from Paul Divilly five minutes before the interval moved the home side into a lead that they never relinquished.
The second half, while a marked improvement in value, transpired however to be a mere formality for Kildare, who tightened up at one end and expressed themselves with greater reward at the other as the Ulster men fell away badly.
Once again, team captain Divilly – who plundered 0-8 in the 1-19 to 0-6 dismissal of Louth - was the scorer-in-chief here for Kildare, with the Confey man adding 2-6 to his name, with all bar his second major coming from placed balls.
His first goal, a fifth minute 20 metre free that flew to the roof of the net, established a 1-1 to 0-1 lead, that after Tony Murphy and Convery (free) had traded scores.
Indeed, the game developed into something of a shoot-out between Divilly and Convery, as the sides swapped scores without either team ever establishing anything more than a single point lead.
Worryingly, a whole 20 minutes passed before Kildare scored their first from play, that a point from corner-forward Gerry Keegan that levelled matters at 1-3 to 0-6.
A fifth free from Convery briefly moved Derry back in front before Keegan, who finished with 0-4, danced his way clear down the right and while he passed up an opportunity to take a straight-forward point, he nonetheless had the presence of mind to brilliantly square for Divilly, who turned home to the onion sack with consummate ease.
At other end Michael Kirkpatrick and midfielder Dara McCloskey pegged back by minors either chance of a missed goal chance for the former, only for Danny Butler and Divilly to raise white flags for the home side which left matters 2-6 to 0-9 at the break.
In contrast to the first, the second half proved to be far less competitive, much of which was down to Kildare finally exerting themselves completely on proceedings.
After Derry sub, Kevin Hinphey, Murphy, Keegan and Convery (free) traded scores, Kildare had the finishing post in sight after striking for six unanswered points between the 40th and 59th minutes, Divilly (4), Keegan and the hard-grafting Danny Butler all finding their range for a 2-14 to 0-11 advantage.
Twenty minutes after their last score, Oisin McCloskey pointed for Derry just past the hour and Convery followed suit moments later, leaving the way clear for subs David Harney and David Kennedy to close out the scoring for Kildare.
Scorers:
Kildare, Paul Divilly 2-6 (1-6f), Gerry Keegan 0-4, Tony Murphy 0-2, Danny Butler 0-2, David Harney 0-1, David Kennedy 0-1.
Derry: Rory Convery 0-8 (8f), Dara McCloskey 0-1, Oisin McCloskey 0-1, Michael Kirkpatrick 0-1, Brendan Rodgers 0-1, Kevin Hinphey 0-1.

Source: PWInsiderWASHINGTON - Following some tough losses to ranked opponents, the No. 15/14 Georgetown University women's lacrosse team (3-3) was in need of a win. The Blue & Gray managed to do just that on Saturday with a thrilling 9-8 comeback victory over the No. 2/2 University of North Carolina Chapel Hill Tar Heels (8-1) at Multi-Sport Field. The win improved Georgetown to 3-3 overall while handing the Tar Heels' their first loss of the season.
"Today was a good team effort, we stuck to the game plan and plugged away at them with a workman-like effort," said Georgetown Head Coach Ricky Fried. "A win like this builds your confidence which I think we needed tremendously. The coaches knew we could play at this level, but I think the girls needed to experience beating a team of this caliber to believe they are at that level."
Staring at an 8-5 three-goal deficit with 15 minutes remaining in the contest, the Blue & Gray packed it in on defense and took advantage on offense to stage a four-goal run.
Sophomore midfielder Kelyn Freedman (Newtown Square, Pa./Radnor) hit an unassisted tally at 12:17 to start things off and classmate Hannah Franklin (Phoenix, Md./McDonogh School) pulled Georgetown within one just a minute later on a free position shot.
Junior attacker Dina Jackson (Potomac, Md./Bullis) tied the game at 5:36 slicing through the defense for an unassisted goal. The game winner came from junior midfielder Sophia Thomas (Lutherville, Md./Maryvale Prep) who finished a good look at the cage at 2:42 for the go-ahead goal.
Clinging to a one-goal advantage, the defense continued to stay strong and UNC's final look at the cage with just seconds remaining ricocheted off of the pipe as the Hoyas hung on for the 9-8 victory.
The Tar Heels opened the contest with two quick scores, but the Blue & Gray answered as Franklin hit her first of the afternoon at 20:31 on the assist from graduate student Kristen Coleman (Potomac, Md./Academy of the Holy Cross).
UNC quickly made the score 3-1, but the Hoyas put together a three-goal run to take their first lead of the game. Franklin scored at 16:20, before senior midfielder Erin Lovett (Wantagh, N.Y./Kellenberg Memorial) found the back of the cage two minutes later. Coleman tallied the go-ahead at 14:25.
The lead was short lived as UNC tied it up 25 seconds later, but Georgetown had already proved it could play with the Tar Heels.
North Carolina finished out the half with a three goal run as the squads went into the break with UNC leading, 6-4.
Franklin opened the second half with a goal, but North Carolina's Becky Lynch hit two quick scores giving the Tar Heels a three-goal advantage. GU's final run of the game would be enough as the Hoyas found a way to win.
Franklin led the way for Georgetown with four goals to her credit, while Coleman added a goal and an assist. Freedman had four draw controls on the afternoon and junior defender Ashley Hunter (Fort Washington, Md./St. Stephen's & St. Agnes) added a squad-best four ground balls.
Georgetown was outshot, 21-17, but had more ground balls (12-9) and a 10-8 advantage on draw controls. Sophomore goalkeeper Barb Black (Ruxton, Md./St. Paul's School for Girls) took the win in the cage with six saves.
"The defense played well today," said Fried. "It was a team effort with everyone having each other's backs. We made them earn their goals today."
The win is the first over a ranked opponent for the Hoyas this season.
Georgetown will be back in action on Wednesday as the squad travel to Philadelphia to take on the No. 9/9 University of Pennsylvania Quakers. The opening draw at Franklin Field is scheduled for 7 p.m. Live stats and a webcast will be available at.(
Great debate!
Russert posed some very strong questions to both candidates to catch them both off guard at times – good for him to ask the straight and tough questions.
Unfortunately for Clinton, my gut feeling is that she is losing supporters with every comment she makes. Why do I feel that way!!??
Obama just cannot be budged, he has some sort of invicibility to him that Hillary has simply not figured out yet!
I think her chances are seriously diminishing.
Very childish Hillary.
I guarantee you the pundits are mocking you tomorrow over the SNL whine.
SNL is a comedy show. Who cares?
Grow up!!
Contrary to the Clinton Shame on You shock, Obama acts like the leader for me, for us all!!!
The MSNBC cuts off Hillary’s voice all the time, We can not hear the whole completed sentence from Hillary, I listen to MSNBC the questions for Hillary, they intent to gave hard time to Hillary, special Tim Russet when he ask questions he is so "mean:, I said here to all American, if media using this way, it is not fair, it is not running a USA President, it is control and selecting the person Media like, even that candidate was not qualify. But they like, just like…
Jane Robertson...the lapel pin and saluting the flag discussion ended about two months ago. I certainly hope you are not from Ohio.
It has been right along one sided..the press and obama..like he is their lover...and was obama on drugs...his eye balls where soooooo large and looked like he could hardly keep awake..she is so much more ready to lead this country
Did all you Obamabots get that on two questions that went to Hillary first, Obama basically pointed to her and said basically "Yeah, what she said" (not a direct quote but merely a paraphrase...
They just keep cutting her off....so obviously biased. Can't wait to see how SNL does a skit on this. She knows so much more.
They ask her first so he won't look like a fool. He just agrees with her on the tough questions.
Spare me.
Both Clinton and Obama have benefited from all the attention the media has given them. If Richardson or Biden had gotten as much media attention they might be the presumptive nominees and we wouldn't be stuck with these two.
Very pro-Obama I thought.
Hillary is the best.......................................................................................
Hillary you are a quick, that is why you are the best...............
True, true. Go HILLARY.......LOVE you.
The "Good 'Ole Boys Network" is alive and well, and the commentators played that out. Senator Clinton is treated differently and it is because she's a woman.
I think she would make a great candidate and could take on McCain in a more effectively than Obama.
The moderators shouldn't be so obvious in their candidate of choice.
Well, the debate just finished. I have to say that I am an Obama supporter, but I was very impressed with Hillary's tone and demeanor. She did very well. Even when the tough question, "Who is Putin's replacement?" was thrown at her (which by all rights should have been posed to Barack, because one of his purported weaknesses is foreign policy) she had the answer. I still support Barack, but I was very impressed with Hillary. Earlier today, my position was that if Hillary got the Demo nomination, I'd vote for McCain. That is no longer the case. Either candidate will do us well.....Good job to both candidates!!
She will win the nomination because it is never about the people. I am glad I am a Clinton supporter but all you Obama people, it is never about what the people want. You should have learned that by now. Hillary 08
Seriously Obama is being favoured by the press. If Hillary brings up real facts, she is going negative, if Obama does he is applauded. What a joke, no wonder Rupert got Fox, the Liberal meida is full of bull. Seriously Obama is going to get ripped a new on by the Republicans, he has so many skeletons and the man is just a smooth talking empty vessel. He has no brains, just a smooth talker full of it. He is a crack head, thief, and a big racist against non-whites/blacks.
If you listen closely all Barack does is agree with Clinton in these debates. I haven't heard Barack say anything original in these debates. I guarantee the Barack love fest will die down soon. If he's the nominee we democrats are going to have to wait another four years for "change".
I think it's great to see hillary standing up for herself against those whom she feels want to bully her. I must say, there are ways to handle criticisms from people. Sarcasm and non verbal agressive manner is not the way to do it. The democratic party wants to continue a foundation of strength and not cracking under pressure.
Vote 08'
To the people of the USA, all of you women who are criticizing Hillary Clinton are MORON, you are all after the crowd, no brain, you're not an American, you're all from nowhere.
Why did Hillary complain since this was her chance to show she has all of the experience she claims to have. I am for Obama and will always support him. I am sick of the debates it is the same on same on.
Truth nothing but the truth! when Hillary speaks about the fact she was declared by media as negative campaigner but when Obama speaks out of boundary he's alright and okay?. What a biased coverage by the media. is this the way how we influence American people to elect our president? Wake up!! It's really obvious that first question is always ask with Hillary but she answered them with full knowledge and very fluent, Obama just getting an idea and expanding her statement. He can't even answer so straightly, is this the president are we looking for? Shame on those who are persuading people in a wrong side.
This is not a personality or rock star race, it is a deadly serious race with the issues that are hurting Americans. If you want Mr. Personality then go ahead and vote for him, but if you want someone to help you with jobs, mortgages, forclosures, education, medical and all the things regular people are having a problem with the vote for Hillary because that is what you will get with her. Mr. Personality will be too busy in the Whitehouse trying to close on the favours he will be owing all the people who have pushed him into the Whitehouse, because it is not his ideas or theories that is doing it.
Well she does.......10 out of the last 15debates, she'sbeen up first..........so the shoe fits, and it's pinching the MEdia and Obama supporters
I think if the clinton- obama ticket will be a winning teamMalia Obama just landed herself an internship in Hollywood! But a lot of people are speaking out saying she only got the position because her dad is the president. Doesn’t that happen for people who aren’t part of the first family, too? Pretty sure it does. Listen to Jeff Johnson explain why people need to stop hating in this edition of 3 Things You Should Know!

In a new analysis of earlier data, two scientists have found that the act of mating is far more harmful to females than the act of egg laying.
The differences are so striking, in fact, that the study may give clues to how females help control their own reproductive fitness, according to a University of Georgia geneticist who is co-author of the research, to be published in the journal Evolution.
"We propose that when females are in control, the costs to their reproductive fitness is minimal," said UGA's Dr. Daniel Promislow. "On the other hand, when males are in control, the costs are substantial." Co-author of the paper is Dr. Marc Tatar of the University of Minnesota.
Scientists have long known there is a tradeoff between reproduction and survival in the animal kingdom, but only recently have new studies in evolution begun to focus on issues of male versus female control. The tradeoff between reproduction and age-specific survival has been widely studied, but Promislow and Tatar in their new analysis focus on the fitness cost of reproduction rather than the survival cost.
Fruit flies are an especially fecund subject for such studies because of their mating habits and short lifespan, which covers from 30 to 90 days. Males and females engage in an elaborate mating ritual, during which males vibrate their wings in a "courtship song" and actually lick the females they choose. Copulation can last anywhere from a few minutes to several hours (depending on the species), during which the male injects into the female seminal fluid that included sperm and fluid from an organ called the accessory gland.
"It gets interesting at this point, because some sperm and the accessory gland fluids are stored in organs called spermathecae," said Promislow. "And the function of the accessory gland proteins appears to be to displace sperm from previous males or prevent the storage of sperm from future matings."
This chemical arms race has serious consequences for the females, who are subjected in this case to reproductive costs imposed by the males. This sperm competition, in fact, appears to occur at the expense of female survival. Both mating and the receipt of accessory gland fluid lead to an "almost immediate depression of female survival" and thus causes a great reduction in reproductive value.
Egg production, which is controlled largely by the female through feeding and other environmental strategies, also reduces female survival, but only relatively late in life when its effect of reproductive fitness is minimal.
The distinction between male- and female-controlled reproductive activities may seem fine, but the potential effects on evolutionary history are considerable.
Promislow and Tatar base their new model on earlier work done by Dr. Linda Partridge and Dr. Kevin Fowler. That work examined tradeoffs between egg production, mating and the receipt of products from male accessory gland fluid from fruit flies. Also important was work by Dr. Tracy Chapman, who determined that the mating cost of reproduction was influenced by the receipt of the male accessory gland fluid. The work of Dr. Larry Harshman and Tim Prout added to the study, since they first suggested that the main cell products of accessory gland fluid may be involved in sperm competition.
Interestingly, Promislow and Tatar found that the fitness costs of mating or the receipt of accessory gland fluid are substantial when a population size is decreasing but modest under conditions of population growth.
"We also found that fitness costs of egg production, however, are not strongly influenced by the rate of increase in the population," said Promislow.
While the evidence for female-controlled versus male-controlled reproductive fitness seems clear enough in the laboratory, it remains unknown whether or not the same is true in the natural world. Promislow and Tatar acknowledge that the difference in fitness costs of mating "might be an artifact of how flies are treated in the laboratory." For example, fitness costs of mating might be lower in the field than in the laboratory if females in the field encounter males less often than when they are confined in vials.
At the same time, fitness costs of egg production may be greater in nature than in the laboratory if adult nutrients are abundant in the laboratory and scarce in the field. As well, females' abilities to avoid predators in the natural world may be affected by egg load. Still, the new work makes clear that a full understanding of the evolution of life history strategies must incorporate behavioral and even physiological interactions between males and females.
"At the very least, we need to start distinguishing the costs that are under the female's control from those that aren't," said Promislow.

JoannaRonald Ssebuguzi says his 2012 sprint championship triumph is a sneak preview of what to expect in the 2013 rally season, writes Moses Mugalu.
Ssebuguzi, who won the Champion of Champions Sprint on Boxing Day at Garuga double circuit to clinch the 2012 sprint championship title, is already plotting for next season's NRC crown. The Mitsubishi Evo 9 ace lost out to this year's eventual champion Jas Mangat in the NRC title race, but he feels more motivated to go for his third championship crown.
"It has been a fairly good year for me on the track and this (sprint) triumph gives me the motivation ahead of the new season," Ssebuguzi, the 2006 and 2009 national rally champion, said today.
He added: "I can't wait to start the new season because the car is in good condition and we have finished off on a winning note. My fans and competitors should expect better performances."
On Wednesday, at the refurbished Garuga race circuit, Ssebuguzi outclassed his opponents including bitter rival Ponsiano Lwakataka as he cruised to an emphatic victory in the Boxing Day Sprint. Meanwhile, Lwakataka, whose Southern Motor Club (SMU) organised the Garuga event, left with a bruised ego after Ssebuguzi beat him head-to-head by more than a minute and half.
Lwakataka (Subaru N8) had vowed to beat Ssebuguzi and, at worst, wash his car if he lost to him. However, in the face of defeat, the motor-mouthed driver didn't honour the bet.

I had never ridden a roller coaster before. It was fun!
— Veronica Martinez: Gastric Bypass Surgery, 2008
"I started gaining weight around age 18-19. Over the next eight years, I gained about 70 pounds. Shortly after I got married, we wanted to start a family. My primary care physician encouraged me to lose weight first and recommended I have weight-loss surgery. Instead, I tried to lose weight on my own but wasn’t successful.
"After three of my close relatives died, I turned to food for comfort and gained another 30 pounds. I was constantly going out to eat. I would have an appetizer, main course, dessert and alcohol. I was snacking between meals all the time. Then, in 2006, I found out I had diabetes. I decided to have gastric bypass surgery to improve my health."
It’s been 16 months since the surgery, and Veronica has lost 96 pounds. She says she is happy with her weight now but will continue working toward her goal of losing 20 more pounds.
Veronica's diet has changed significantly. She now eats a lot of turkey, fish, chicken and salads and has stopped snacking between meals. She now goes out to eat only about twice a month. "I like to cook because I know what’s going into the food I’m preparing."
Veronica says her blood sugar is normal now and she no longer has to take diabetes or cholesterol medication. She has been faithful about taking her vitamins, and she walks an hour a day. She is hoping to have children someday.
"I enjoy traveling. When we went to the Grand Canyon recently, I was able to hike up and down steep areas, whereas I would not have been able to do that before." And when Veronica went to Disney World, she was able to ride the rides comfortably. "I had never ridden a roller coaster before. It was fun!"IRE is bringing its highly rated Better Watchdog Workshop to the University of Minnesota with core sessions that will improve your ability to find information on the Web quickly, point you to key documents that will help you produce quick-hit enterprise stories and give you tips on the best approaches when conducting interviews or developing sources.

Get Rid of Ingrown Hair
Prevent and heal ingrown hair, razor bumps, razor burn, skin irritations; take away the sting or embarrassing redness after shaving.
You may notice, not long after you shave or depilate, that small bumps may appear. These may become further irritated resulting in redness, itchiness, discoloration, or infection.
What is known by Doctors as pseudofolliculitis barbae but commonly referred to as “ingrown hair” or “razor bumps” may be transpiring deep beneath where even your eyes cannot see. This problem affects Men as well as Women. What are the causes of ingrown hairs? And is there anything one can do to effectively deal with them? trapped, the hair creates a reaction to a foreign body?
Razor Bumps (caused by infected hair follicles) come from the end of the hair shaft that, after being shaved, is cut in such a way that again the end of the hair is sharpened and as it continues to grow it curls into another nearby hair follicle. This introduction of the sharpened end of a hair follicle into another causes an inflammatory response in the skin and leads to a pimple or bump because of the inflammation of the skin.. The seriousness of the inflammation and infection of the ingrown hair or razor bump may vary. For some this is an annoying occurrence that doesn’t pose a serious health problem. For others pseudofolliculitis barbae can develop into extreme Folliculitis when the hair follicle becomes acutely inflamed. Bacteria, yeasts, or fungi infections can further exacerbate the problem, and there are even acne variants of this same condition.

Frank Austin, NJ, USAPOMPANO BEACH — Hundreds of Broward Sheriff's deputies and their law enforcement brethren took a brief respite Tuesday from the intense manhunt for a cop killer to pay their respects to Sgt. Chris Reyka and his family.
Funeral visitation was held in the afternoon at the Forest Lawn North Funeral Home and continued through the evening.
Others came from throughout South Florida to honor a man they never met but whose death brought them to tears and renewed their respect for the sacrifices made daily by law enforcement officers.
Sharon Winters, of Deerfield Beach, was among that group. "These kind of people give everything without asking for much or anything in return," she said of the police. "That's hard to remember when you're getting pulled over for a ticket, or if you live like the animals who killed this fine man."
Reyka, 51, of Wellington, was shot to death early Friday in the parking lot of a Pompano Beach Walgreen's, where he was checking license plates to see if the tags or the parked cars were stolen. There is a $106,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of Reyka's killer.
The shooting was the second in less than a week that left a Broward County deputy dead or wounded. Deputy Maury Hernandez, 28, was shot in the head in Pembroke Park on Aug. 6 and remained in critical condition Tuesday.
The support from people like Winters and members of law enforcement who visited the funeral home, including Broward Sheriff Ken Jenne, left Reyka's distraught family feeling overwhelmingly proud and secure.
"This shows how appreciative everyone is," Ashley Reyka, 21, said smiling, referring to her father's involvement in the community, not just his 18 years as a lawman but also as a Boy Scout master and active church member.
Deputies and others who knew Chris Reyka shared stories with the family about things he had done, incidents that were comical and others that were touching.Contracts News

The plant, located 30 kilometres north of Swakopmund, will allow Areva to pump enough water for its Trekkopje uranium mine without pumping any water from the soil.
Namibia's first desalination plant was last week inaugurated.
Desalination is the process of removing salt from seawater.
The desalination plant and distribution infrastructure at Wlotzkasbaken forms part of the overall Trekkopje project. The plant will supply sufficient water to support the mining operations in the Erongo region. The water is conveyed to the Trekkopje mine via a 48 kilometres pipeline supported by three pump stations.
The first and second phases of the process entail seawater passing through ultra filtration membranes that remove coarse debris from the water. The process of reverse osmosis separates the seawater into two streams – a “pure” water and a brine stream, which is gravitationally forced back and dispersed into the ocean.
Once completed, the plant will have the capacity to produce 20 million m3 of potable water per annum.
According to the company, excess water will serve local communities and industrial activities.
An Areva press release states that the Trekkopje mine is the largest direct foreign investment ever made in Namibia and a particularly strategic project for the group.
Upon commissioning, the Trekkopje mine is expected to process 100,000 tonnes of crushed ore per day with an expected production of 3,000 tonnes of U3O8 per year.Catholic Books > Teens > Saints / Remarkable Lives Books >

There were some things, as cotton, cacas, and salt, which they were unable to grow or manufacture, of which they had been deprived for more than fifty years, and their taste was so much affected by this enforced abstinence that they did not get used to eating salt with their food for several generations after the conquest.

Following the acquisition, BayWa would become a leading worldwide supplier of pipfruit.
BayWa has already agreed to the purchase of 63 percent of the issued shares in T&G held by the main shareholder GPG. As required by New Zealand takeover regulations, the acquisition will be made as part of a takeover offer to acquire up to 100 percent of the issued share capital of T&G at a price of NZ$ 1.85 per share. The purchase price range will be between NZ$ 137 million and NZ$ 216 million, or between US$107 million and US$170 million, depending on the level of acceptances by T&G shareholders. The transaction is conditional on approval from the German Federal Cartel Office and the New Zealand Overseas Investment Office.
T&G's presence on five continents will enable BayWa AG to expand its offering in the fruit business and to access global growth markets, particularly Asia, where T&G is already established.
"The takeover is a ground-breaking step towards globalization for BayWa," Klaus Josef Lutz, chief executive officer of BayWa, said in a Nov. 9 press release. "We will become one of the world's most important suppliers of fruit, as Turners & Growers is represented in all key markets on all continents. The door to Asia, the highest growth market for fruit, is now wide open for BayWa's fruit trading business."
T&G is New Zealand's market leader in the export and domestic distribution of dessert fruit. In addition, the company holds the exclusive brand rights for the global cultivation and sale of the Jazz and Envy apple varieties and the ENZAGreen, ENZAGold and ENZARed kiwi varieties. Furthermore, the company holds a 70 percent stake in Delica NZ, New Zealand's largest diversified exporter of fresh fruit and the sole exporter of ENZA dessert fruit to Asia. T&G functions as a trading platform for apples in South America, the United States, South Africa, Asia and Europe.
BayWa AG is an international trading and services company in its core segments of agriculture, building materials and energy. In the financial year 2010, the company generated an EBIT of almost 130 million euro and revenues of approximately 8 billion euro with its workforce of more than 16,000 employees.
In its Fruit Business unit, the BayWa Group is a leading supplier of German dessert fruit to food retailers and the largest supplier of pipfruit from organic production.
T&G was founded in 1897 and employs a workforce of around 1,400 employees within the group. The international company achieved annual revenues of 346 million euro in 2010. Its core business consists of exporting apples, kiwis and tomatoes and providing the associated logistics.HUNTSVILLE, Alabama - The National Weather Service office in Huntsville sent crews out across North Alabama today to map and track the storms that swept through the area Wednesday. "There were so many, it's going to take a while," Meteorologist Kurt Weber said at noon Thursday.

Weber said the storms may rival 1974's Super Outbreak of Tornadoes that spawned 148 twisters across the South and Midwest. "That's not official," Weber said.
The National Weather Service will post storm tracks and other information on its website when available, Weber said. That likely won't happen before tonight at the earliest, Weber said, citing the difficulties facing the crews in traveling across the area and dealing with the sheer number of storms.
One survey team will visit Franklin and Lawrence counties; another will be in Cullman, Morgan and Marshall counties; one will be in Limestone and Madison counties; and one will be in DeKalb County.Price Dr, Farmville, VA 23901

Walks With Men Book Review Summary
Ann Beattie Booklist
Ann Beattie Message Board
Detailed plot synopsis reviews of back to him.
Since Jane's boyfriend Ben resides in Vermont and she's in New York, and a bit bored with her relationship with Ben, she goes along with the plan. Her goal, to better understand men so she can use the information to set her post-graduate life on the fast track in love and financial matters.
From the looks of things, Ben will soon be history. As Jane grows comfortable engaging in random talks about men and what makes them tick with Neil, she realizes how bored she has become with Ben and his life on the dairy farm. What she doesn't do initially, is level with him about her change of heart.
Neil uses his writing skills, and has success with a book he has written, that allows him to say goodbye to Bernard and his full-time teaching job. At the same time he uses a pen name creating a popular advice column for women. His success gives him confidence and an air of arrogance that makes him think he really knows women and is best suited for lending information to help the fairer sex avoid certain life pitfalls.
With Neil's guidance, Jane breaks things off with Ben (in a letter). Ben has changed his name to Goddess, after inheriting forty acres (when the couple he performed chores for in exchange for living accommodations dies). He turns his portion of the land into a yoga studio which he names, Goddess Studio. Jane learns of her ex's new endeavors from a postman she keeps in touch with.
Neil is smart enough to know that to keep his writings on the pulse of women that he is going to have to know lingo of the women and in some cases, of the younger generation as well. For this needed information, the guru turns to his teenage niece. Neil likes to impress people with his knowledge, especially, women.
It appears that Neil is using Jane for information too, (he often has her research his ideas) and then uses the information for writing projects where he benefits financially. Neil also feeds off of Jane's youthfulness without making it look like it. He keeps her in student mode, while he gets as much information out of her as she does from him. Only she doesn't make him agree to anything.
Jane and Neil move in together in Chelsea and his wife appears. They have been married eleven years, yet Neil neglected to mention any of this to Jane. His wife however, knew all about Jane and was coming to do her a woman-sister-friend favor, to warn her not to get in any deeper with her husband.
A slickster, Neil had already told his wife that the affair he was engaging in with Jane would actually bring the couple closer. Neil is a man who hates women. Lisa knows it, and Jane is beginning to see the light through youthful eyes.
Neil is filthy rich, Jane has no clue until Lisa shares the rather large piece of need-to-know information. He's also a womanizer. Jane nor Lisa are enough for his inflated ego. When confronted with Jane's new found knowledge of how low he is, he manipulates her turning the tables.
Determined to have someone, Jane marries Neil after he and Lisa divorce. She signs a pre-nup long enough to fill a composition notebook. The marriage is short lived, Neil is shot to death. The word on the street is that he was caught handling another man's wife.
Jane has learned her lesson, she now knows that all advice isn't good. Especially when it is being offered with strings and conditions, painted to look like love.
Best part of story, including ending:
I dId not like how much Jane dummied down to Neil.
Best scene in story:
My favorite scene was when Jane and Lisa met
Opinion about the main character:
I disliked how much Jane put up with trying to have a relationship with self-centered Neil.

It looked dyer from the outset, but the Blues quickly turned it around and dominated the end result, beating Norwich 4-1 courtesy of Torres, Lampard, Hazard, and Ivanovich, respectively. Mata proved crucial in distribution.
Go Blues!
I didn’t get to watch the game, but I followed it live on Twitter for the last 20 minutes. The Blues didn’t start racking up the goals until Hazard came on around that time. Mata got a double, David Luiz scored a howler of a free kick, and Ramires put away a goal in the last minutes. And Cech got a clean sheet.
Well done, Blues!.. (WAGNH: Chelsea come away from Emirates with impressive win”)
WAGNH “Chelsea vs Wolves: Blues cruise in 6-0 thrashing”
Goals came courtesy of Cahill, Bertrand, Mata, Romeu, Torres, and Moses, respectively.
Chelsea beat Stoke at home 1-nil, but it was a battle, and it was very narrow. Cole scored his first goal in two years, I believe. Great for him, and great for the Blues, as Cech kept a clean sheet, awarding us the win with their combined contributions.
Hardly did we take to the wings. For the most part, we tried to Barcelona our way in through the middle. Unfortunately, Torres was one dimensional, making runs forwards or backwards, but hardly ever sideways or diagonal. If we play only one forward, we need a striker who is multi-dimensional and also goal hungry. He works hard, I know, but without proper blend, he’s just being unproductive, which keeps our offense largely ineffective.
I would say that we could try a 4-4-2, but I can understand reticence against leaving the midfield partially exposed. But we used to play a 4-3-3. Why couldn’t we play a 4-4-2? For that matter, couldn’t we do a 4-3-3? Let’s look.
4-4-2
Cech
Ivanovich – Cahill – John Terry – Cole
Mikel
Oscar – Mata – Hazard
Sturridge – Torres
4-3-3
Cech
Ivanovich – Cahill – John Terry – Cole
Oscar – Mata – Hazard
Sturridge – Torres – Moses
If we have 6 attacking players from the midfield on up, we won’t need Ivanovich to push up, leaving us exposed in the back, along with Cole. Hence, we won’t need a holding midfielder such as Mikel. We have so much offensive talent now, a 4-4-2 or a 4-3-3 may be the only way to take full advantage of it.
In fact, if you consider today’s lineup, we found ourselves approaching our path to the goal too narrowly. Here was the lineup:
Cech
Ivanovich – Cahill – David Luiz – Cole
Ramires – Mikel
Mata – Oscar – Hazard
Torres
But, functionally, here’s how it really looked:
Cech
David Luiz – Cahill – Cole
Mikel
Ivanovich – Ramires – Mata – Oscar – Hazard
Torres
Or, alternatively,
Cech
Ivanovich – David Luiz – Cahill
Mikel
Ramires – Mata – Oscar – Hazard – Cole
Torres
Or, also,
Cech
Mikel – David Luiz – Cahill
Ivanovich – Ramires – Mata – Oscar – Hazard – Cole
Torres
Unfortunately, we played congested, trying to link up all of our midfielders centrally, resulting in one too many passes all too often. Someone needs to display a little selfishness, or the wing runs need to be there to add the width. I’m not saying to get into a crossing game of 50/50 balls, but we need to add width and add dimension. We were too congested in the midfield as the fullbacks pushed up and as Ramires pushed up. It’s the same thing as too many cooks in the kitchen–it doesn’t work. We need to accommodate the midfielders that we have and try and spark some life into the forward line, and I think that a 4-4-2 or a 4-3-3 will help do just that, at least on paper. But I digress.
We won, isn’t that enough?
Well, sad we didn’t start our Champions League debut defending our title with a win and three points, but glad to see Oscar making an impact.
More Mikel flamer fuel with his losing the ball and failure to drop and defending resulting in the Old Lady’s equalizer.
Torres the pedestrian? Well, I didn’t really watch the game, so I can’t substantiate, but if he doesn’t leave a consistent impact soon, I bet we offload him in January.
Carefree. KTBFFH!
Chelsea couldn’t win away to QPR today. Here’s the starting lineup employed:
Cech
Ivanovic, David Luiz, Terry, Cole
Mikel, Lampard
Ramires, Hazard, Bertrand
Torres
We no longer have Essien, so I’m just not keen on a double pivot here. I would rather see this lineup:
Cech
Ivanovic, Cahill, Terry, Cole
Mikel
Ramires, Mata, Hazard, Moses
Torres
I would sub on Oscar for Ramires, Lampard for Mata, and Sturridge for Moses. Keep Torres on. He has the golden boot–let him play and maintain confidence. Keep Hazard on, since he is, well, hazardous.
Having a single holding midfielder with complete trust in our back four, I feel that with our midfield ingenuity we can create more offensive chances and still keep the opposition at bay.
Depending on what happens in January, I might change my opinion, but for now, I would opt for a 4-1-4-1 formation.
Chelsea FC > Match Report | We Ain’t Got No History > Initial Reaction
Queens Park Rangers managed to keep us at bay while we were on the road. Unfortunately, with all the skill of Hazard, he couldn’t find the net on two prime occasions. His first was early in the first half, and when he should have gone far post, he opted an in-step near post curl, proving an easy save for Cesar. His second was late in the second half, after Moses was able to cross the ball low, he failed to stand up and put his knee over the ball, resulting in a sky high effort, but it was an absolute sitter. Unfortunate. Torres had a good run into the box, beating the entire back line, but instead of taking it with his right foot to the far post, he tried to cut back and use an in-step far post curl. However, it went straight to Cesar. Unfortunate. And though everybody said Hazard will win the most PKs this season, he had one moment that appeared to me like a PK decision, but alas the referee did not award one. Such were the offensive efforts of the Blues on this day.
Most notably, we did not allow a goal, but not for lack of chances. Mikel gave away a prime opportunity for Cisse–which will prove to be more fodder for Mikel haters–setting up the ball on a silver platter for QPR’s number 9 to feast upon, but Cech was up to the task and held him up masterfully whilst the back four dropped back into the goal line and nothing came of it. Earlier in the game, the pirate that is Granero–the recent Real Madrid signing for QPR–placed in a cross to J. S. Park, and Ivanovich and David Luiz were both caught ball watching, leaving Park for a free header, but, fortunately, it went straight to Cech for an easy save.
Offensively, we were unfortunate. Defensively, we were fortunate. As a result, we walked away sharing the spoils.
This game was an improvement by comparison to last season’s fixture when we lost 1-nil and had two sending offs for Bosingwa, who is now a QPR left back, and Drogba (Do you remember him?).
The commentators of the game made some points that I will respectfully disagree with, most notably that Chelsea will miss Drogba. Who won’t miss the legendary number 11, the African Messiah, the colossal powerhouse that is Drogba? Remember that Torres thrashed QPR in our home game last season. Remember that we lost to QPR last season. In perspective, all things considered, Torres is a different player, but one that we can be quite pleased with. We are already fairing better than we did last season, and though we don’t have maximum points anymore, we are still undefeated and have shown comparable improvements from last season.
Now, at 80:00, Torres was subbed off. He didn’t take a seat on the bench, but instead he decided to go straight to the locker room. Is he still unhappy with Chelsea?
Carefree.
Cahill scored our loan goal. Falcao tore us apart. Embarrassing display. Enough said.

Galileo PFI delayed by revenue fears
Euro satnav project wanders off track
Posted in Science, 15th March 2007 11:16 GMT so far cannot agree on the details. Delays caused by wrangling have effectively stalled the whole enterprise, with at least a year's delay already, and European Union (EU) officials are attempting to move things forward.
The main corporate players are EADS, the company which owns Airbus and has a substantial share in the controversial Eurofighter; Thales and Alcatel-Lucent from France; Italy's Finmeccanica; Aena and Hispasat of Spain; UK company Inmarsat; and a German alliance led by Deutsche Telekom. Most of these firms have substantial involvement with European national governments, and some commentators have suggested that the usual Euro struggle for national pie-slice is at the root of the trouble.
All this has led Jacques Barrot, the EU transport commissioner, to write firm letters to the companies demanding the reasons for the delays. And Germany, as the current holder of the EU presidency, is attempting to get the weight of the national governments behind the Brussels administration. German transport minister Wolfgang Tiefensee is to chair a meeting of his counterparts next week.
But national jostling for position may not be the whole story. Some are asking why the private sector should sink large sums into Galileo, when it is not clear how much revenue would ensue or who would get it. The current American GPS system is paid for by the US Department of Defense, and is free for users worldwide. This is hard to compete against.
The London Financial Times today quoted an unnamed corporate exec as saying "Why sell Pepsi when you can get Coke for free?" It also suggested that European governments might have to guarantee a revenue stream to get companies to invest, perhaps by requiring emergency services to subscribe to Galileo.
Galileo could offer significant advantages over the existing GPS constellation, however, which customers might pay for. GPS receivers often lose their locating signal where large areas of the sky are obscured, as in built-up areas, and new satellites may be able to eliminate or reduce this problem. Galileo is also intended to offer a paid-for signal accurate to less than 1 metre, which is much superior to ordinary GPS performance. Nonetheless, it is unclear whether or how much people will pay for this added functionality.
It isn't even clear that they will have to pay if they don't want to. GPS, for instance, was originally intended to offer its full accuracy only to US and allied forces, but workarounds were developed almost at once. One of the most popular is so-called "Differential GPS," (DGPS) where the regional error in the publicly-available GPS signal is constantly worked out by a ground station at a known location and transmitted to the DGPS receiver using any of a variety of comms links. Accuracy to rival the new Galileo signal is often achievable, and DGPS isn't hugely complex or expensive to set up.
There may be simpler ways to get Galileo pay functions for free. Galileo test satellites are already in orbit, and the encryption on their signals was cracked almost at once. This is not to say that the same will happen to the main system when and if it goes live, but it seems fairly likely. The situation is much the same as that with high-def DVD; legitimate customers must be able to get the content, so hackers will probably be able to as well.
And there are other foes for Galileo to face. The occasionally-erratic Russian GLONASS constellation has been around for a long time, and the nascent Chinese space industry is said to be moving fast with yet another rival. Meanwhile, other locator-tech solutions such as E-OTD have been implemented using existing mobile masts rather than satellites.
All in all, the Galileo companies' doubts over revenue seem quite understandable. Without a big injection of government cash, the route ahead may be a difficult one to navigate. ®Brands and Their Owners

In pathologic cases it is possible to have a lot of empty space on a lot of your index pages. Reindexing would change that to a smaller number. In earlier versions, I think it was possible to have completely empty pages and this happened for patterns of use (new values monotonically increasing, oldest values deleted first) that were actually seen in practice.Wonton 51

Terms of the deal call for Raleigh, N.C.-based Martin Marietta to pay 0.7 of its shares for each share of Texas Industries. The deal values Texas Industries at $71.95 per share, a premium of less than 1% from Monday's close but 15% above the average closing prices of the two companies since Dec. 12 when word of a potential deal first leaked.
As part of the deal Martin Marietta would assume about $700 million in Texas Industries debt. Martin Marietta said it expects to extract about $70 million in pre-tax synergies by 2017, and said it believes the deal will immediately contribute to earnings per share.
The deal comes less than two years after Martin Marietta made an unsuccessful hostile bid for rival Vulcan Materials (VMC - Get Report) offering $4.9 billion for the Birmingham, Ala.-based target. The company has been eager to build its scale as a provider of construction aggregates and expand its geographic reach ahead of an expected recovery in the housing market.Dallas-based Texas Industries is the largest producer of cement in its home state and a major producer in California. Martin Marietta said that the purchase would add about 800 million tons of aggregates reserves, creating a company with a network of more than 400 quarries, mines, distribution yards and plants spanning 36 states, Canada and the Caribbean. "By uniting Martin Marietta's and Texas Industries' complementary assets and leveraging an expanded geographic footprint, we will be even better-positioned to deliver value to our shareholders and customers," Martin Marietta CEO Ward Nye said in a statement. "Texas Industries' aggregates operations are strategically located in high growth markets and fit well into our existing portfolio, and its cement operations will further diversify our product and customer mix." Texas Industries CEO Mel Brekhus called the deal "a unique opportunity to create a more competitive company with a solid, diversified portfolio of assets, enhanced credit profile and a strong balance sheet." The company's two largest shareholders, who together own about 51% of its shares outstanding, have pledged support for the transaction. Martin Marietta received financial advice from JPMorgan Chase (JPM), a Deutsche Bank (DB) team of Paul Stefanick, Tom Bradshaw, James Ratigan and Scott Spieth and Barclays' Richard Siegel and Mark Hudson. A Cravath, Swaine & Moore team including partners Scott A. Barshay, George F. Schoen, Eric W. Hilfers, Andrew W. Needham and Matthew Morreale providing legal counsel. Nathan Eldridge and Milad Hadziabdic from Citigroup (C) advised Texas Industries. Mark Gordon and Gordon Moodie of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz provided legal counsel.1 / 5Lake Havasu City vacation rentalLake Havasu City Home3 Bedrooms / 2 Bathrooms / Sleeps 8Home / 3 Bedrooms / Sleeps 85 PhotosDetailsInquire for ratesEmail OwnerSee allClose xBedrooms:3Bathrooms:2Sleeps:8Type:HomeNo rental rates available - please contact the owner Pets allowed:No Internet:NoNewly remodeled 3 bedroom, 2 bath home for rent.

Actually the plan photograph does show it to be an incredibly tidy design with an extremely narrow rear thanks to magical gearbox shrinking technology. The sidepods are also significantly abbreviated with some cute little aero tricks at the leading edge.
See more pics of the Ferrari F2012 Formula One car
Unlike the McLaren, Ferrari is saying the F2012 is an evolution of last year's not-ever-to-be-called-the-F150. Like the McLaren, it massively borrows from the Red Bull book of making quick F1 cars quicker by going one step further in switching its rear suspension concept from ‘push-rod' to ‘pull-rod', all in the name, once again, of making the car clean in front of the rear wing.
Then there's the nose. We hardly need to say it. The explanation for McLaren avoiding the blight of the platypus snout is apparently that the boffins at Woking have always followed a lower nose aero-concept, so making the tub work with this year's new 7cm lower nose was less of a challenge.
The F2012 won't be getting any shakedown miles any time soon. Fiorano is under a ton of snow. Next week, however, is the first official F1 test of the season. More significantly, Monday is the launch of the Red Bull RB8. It's going to be interesting to see if Adrian Newey goes ugly, too. We somehow doubt it.

I believe the fluid should travel from the upper to the lower rad hose. Therefore if the tstat and water pump are working properly the rad should cool it down towards the lower hose. From everything I read not sure I could rule out water pump/fan clutch/aux. fan/rad blockage.
You can run a head gasket test pretty easy. Go to autozone or other and borrow their fluid reservoir. By a bottle of HG fluid, stick it on the rad and it will change colors if gas is in the coolant. Great for peace of mind.
Also, you can jump the aux fan with a paper clip and leave it on high when you drive to keep the engine cool. (No it is not a fix).
Well, here we are, something old that's actually new to me and no doubt many others. The HG colour change fluid test. Brilliant ! Larrick please do that right away sir.
And I'd like to say, with respect to 525it, that drilling holes in the thermostat is completely unnecessary. I've never done it and it has never made anything difficult. You don't have to be worried if you don't do it. Its another myth for the modern age, that may have had a relevance in an earlier era.
I agree that you should change your thermostat and water pump. Oreilly's sells a composite impeller thermostat for around $50, with a lifetime warranty. If the HG fluid test checks out and your HG is ok, then please change both the thermostat and the water pump. They both have approximately the same life span, if I'm not mistaken.
Just remembered. Another way to check for HG problems is via the compression test.

Thanks for any help. Rgds WilHaving a Messi or Ronaldo at our FUT 13 club FUT 13 cost us a fortune. Top players cards are very expensive. It is normal.
Although on a different scale, there are others FIFA 13 Ultimate Team cards which can be considered as expensive.
Find out which cards are in the TOP 10 of most expensive non-players FUT 13 cards and why they are so valuable.
Expensive FIFA 13 Ultimate Team Non-Players Cards
In FIFA 13 Ultimate Team, there are some non-players cards whose market value amounts to a few thousand coins. These cards can be a good business opportunity since they give some profit margin to those who buy and sell them.
We made the TOP 10 of the most valuable non-players cards. The value considered for each card was found by weighting the price charged in previous FUT versions and the price that these cards have currently in the auction house.
TOP 10 of most expensive FIFA 13 Ultimate Team Non-Players cards
The ten most valuable non-players cards of FUT 13 are all rare and half of them are silver. They cover various areas such as formations, positions, managers and head coaches.
Vejamos quais são:
1st Place – CAM-CM
Category: Training
Sub-category: Position
Level: Gold (rare)
Estimated Price: 6.000 to 10.000 coins
The training card most expensive of FIFA 13 Ultimate Team is that one that allows a player to change his favourite position from CAM to CM. Its high price is justified because there are more popular formations with CM’s than with CAM’s. If you want to hire top players to your club as David Silva, Sneijder or Ozil without losing points in chemistry, you will have to spend a lot of coins.
2nd Place – CF-ST
Category: Training
Sub-category: Position
Level: Gold (rare)
Estimated Price: 4.000 to 8.000 coins
Also the card that lets you change the preferred position of a player from CF to ST reaches very high values in FIFA 13 Ultimate Team. All formations have at least one striker but not all have a forward. Some of the best players in the world are CF, as Messi or Rooney, so this card is almost mandatory if you want to keep a good chemistry. For clubs with low budgets, it may be better to find other alternatives instead of spending so many coins on a single training card.
3rd Place – 4-1-2-1-2
Category: Training
Sub-category: Formation
Level: Gold (rare)
Estimated Price: 4.000 to 8.000 coins
Among all the FIFA 13 Ultimate Team formations, the 4-1-2-1-2 is one of the most popular and also the most expensive one. This formation takes the classic 4-4-2 and gives it a little more defensive security. If you are thinking building a squad with this formation, you should do the math first. It’s expensive. Very expensive.
4th Place – P. Panu
Category: Staff
Sub-category: Head Coach
Level: Silver (rare)
Estimated Price: 4.000 to 7.000 coins
Pace is expensive for players but also for staff. Panu is the most expensive from all silver head coaches in FIFA 13 Ultimate Team. And all of them are quite expensive. If you ever find this card in a pack, you should know that you have won a small fortune.
5th Place – N. Ustinov
Category: Staff
Sub-category: Head Coach
Level: Silver (rare)
Estimated Price: 4.000 to 7.000 coins
We already told you that rare silver head coaches are stupidly expensive in FIFA 13 Ultimate Team. Except for their rarity, there’s no reason for it. The only utility of Ustinov is to increase the effect of shooting training card in 10%. Unless you enjoy collecting cards, the best thing to do is to buy the other coaches and let this increase in 40%.
6th Place – G. Welling
Category: Staff
Sub-category: Head Coach
Level: Silver (rare)
Estimated Price: 3.500 to 6.000 coins
Welling is more one of the ultra valuable head coaches in FUT 13. By his value, you can buy rare gold contracts for your whole squad. Possibly coins are better spent…
7th Place – P. Wadhams
Category: Staff
Sub-category: Head Coach
Level: Silver (rare)
Estimated Price: 3.000 to 5.000 coins
With Wadhams in your club, players in which you apply a heading training card will do it 10% better. During one match. Then you have to keep buying training cards. And that costs coins.
8th Place – C. Smith
Category: Staff
Sub-category: Head Coach
Level: Silver (rare)
Estimated Price: 3.000 to 5.000 coins
As Wadhams is to heading, Wellings is to defens and Ustinov is to shooting, Smith is the silver guy to driblle. Unless you do not mind spending a lot of coins in a coach that is worse than their gold friends, do not make this investment.
9th Place – Joaquin Low
Category: Staff
Sub-category: Manager
Level: Gold (rare)
Estimated Price: 2.000 to 3.000 coins
The current manager of German team is the most expensive in FIFA 13 Ultimate Team. If your goal is to gather enough managers to get the 50% bonus on contracts cards, then it is best to forget the 3% of Low. Buy three rare bronze managers. You will pay less.
10th Place – Vicent Del Bosque
Category: Staff
Sub-category: Manager
Level: Silver (rare)
Estimated Price: 2.000 to 3.000 coins
The top ten of the training and staff card more expensive of FUT 13, ends with the current manager of Spain. If your goal is to boost the contracts, do the same as Low. Forget him and replace him with cheaper alternatives. If you think buying the old player and manager of Real Madrid to help the chemistry of your team full of Spanish players, it is better to bet on Unai Emery or Roberto Martinez.
this is just a list of cards you own and want to sell for high prices -_-
The value considered for each card was found by weighting the price charged in previous FUT versions and the price that these cards have currently in the auction house.
If you have a better list, please post here and show how do you calculate the values of your list.
What about:
LW->LM
LW-LM is one of the most expensive non-players cards. But not one of the top 10.
Do player position cards work both ways so if I get a CDM->CM card can I do CM->CDM
No.
There is a CDM-CM card and there is another one CM-CDM. You can not use position cards on both ways. It will not work.
Can i switch cf-cm ?
Sure.
Just go to auction market and filter by training – position. Then, buy and apply the CF-CAM and CAM-CM cards to the player that you want to modify.
Regards
I havent find it in the auction
Go to Trading – Auction Search – Training Search – Position. You need to search for it with a bit more patience. Probably you will need to browse 7 or 8 pages to find it.
Is there anyway I can transfer een LW to a CAM?
No, there isn’t. With training cards you can apply the following positions:
RB-RWB, LB-LWB, RM-RW-RF, LM-LW-LF, CDM-CM-CAM-CF-ST.
can I do a RM-CM change? if so, how expensive?
No, you can’t. With training cards you can only apply the following positions:
RB-RWB, LB-LWB, RM-RW-RF, LM-LW-LF, CDM-CM-CAM-CF-ST.
Can you make a left forward, Centre Mid? If so how?
Hi. No. The sequences are CDM-CM-CAM-CF-ST; RB-RWB; LB-LWB; RM-RW-RF; LM-LW-LF.
The only way is when some IF players are released in new positions.
If the chemistry of your player is perfect, maybe you can apply LF-LW-LM and put him as CM and still get individual chemistry 9. But it isn’t easy. Check our Chemistry Guide to learn more about it.
Can you turn a RM to a CM ?
No. A RM can only turn into a RW or RF. You put a RM playing as CM but you will be penalized in the individual and team chemistry.
can you do RW-RM
Yes. There is a training card that allows you to turn a RW into a RM.
If you want to make a LW a RW, hit the d-pad right at the start of the game and select switch wings. Won’t upset chemistry. Not a perfect solution but its damn near.
It is a very good tip. You can also make a substitution after the match started. You won’t upset the chemistry either.
How do you know it doesn’t upset chem.
Hi.
We know because we made a huge research to write our Chemistry Guide.

The sounds of the great Western composers, such as Mozart, Beethoven and Bach, performed by internationally acclaimed musicians. The food, the socializing and networking, the kibitzing, the receptions at embassies, ambassadorial residences and international cultural centers. They're all perfectly good reasons to check out the Embassy Series, Washington's unique musical series.
But Embassy Series founder Jerome Barry had something additional in mind when he began and developed the series. It's called cultural diplomacy by way of musical diplomacy, a vision which has allowed him to enlarge the series to embrace a truly international vista.
The Iraqi Cultural Center at 1630 Connecticut Ave., N.W., in Dupont Circle provides an ideal setting and example for conducting that sort of cultural diplomacy Friday and Saturday at 7:30 p.m. when the Two Rivers Eastern Ensemble, a six-piece group of Middle Eastern and Western artists combine their talents to produce an evening of jazz fused with Maqam, a 400-year-old genre of Arab music which originated in ancient Iraq. The Two Rivers Eastern Ensemble will perform using both folkloric (the santour) and modern (the trumpet) instruments, singing in Arabic, and dressed in traditional ethnic outfits.
“Many instruments such as al-oud, a-santur and the tambourine were invented in ancient Mesopotamia,” said Jabir Habeb, Ambassador of the Republic of Iraq to the United States. “The Sumerians were the first to compose the musical system. This ancient music was shared by many ethnic groups who lived in this region including Arabs, Assyrians, Kurds, Armenians and Turks. The Maqams were considered by many to be the foundation of Eastern music."
"These unique artists are meant to emphasize Iraq's music , history and cultural influence,” Barry said. The artists are unique to the American scene while many are of Iraqi origin. In terms of the Embassy Series, "this is what we mean when we talk about uniting people through musical diplomacy," Barry said. "We provide a forum--through concerts--that combines music with information about a country's culture and history."
In 2010, with the long, grinding effects of the war in Iraq still being felt by both nations, the first such concert at the Iraqi Cultural Center provided an electric evening of different cultures meeting--and often whistling with approval--on a musical playing field. Audiences used to the rapt listening atmosphere of classical music concerts also provided by the Embassy Series soon joined in the more participatory atmosphere of the concert of Iraq music using ancient musical instruments which created rhythmic, soulful sounds and songs.
In its 18-year history, the Embassy Series has performed in more than 60 embassies, residences, chanceries, diplomatic chanceries and cultural institutions, opening up the world of countries and cultures not encountered on such an intimate level. The series was the first to perform at the newly opened embassies of many former Soviet-bloc, Eastern European countries in the 1990s, and performed at the Cuban Interests Section, the Vietnamese Embassy and the opening of the new (and huge) Chinese Embassy in 2010.

Suspect charged in the murder of a retired police chief in a drive-by shooting had been arrested by him several times
By PoliceOne Staff
TOMPKINSVILLE, Ky. — A retired police chief was killed in a drive-by shooting outside his home in what is being described as a revenge killing.
Herbert Proffitt, formerly of the Tompkinsville Police Department, was walking in his driveway on the way to the mailbox Tuesday when the suspect drove by and fired shots, killing him. According to Lex18.com, accused killer Charles Hammer was arrested by the chief several times over the past four decades and finally booked into Kentucky State Penitentiary in the 1980s.
"[Officers] deal with a segment of society, some of which are pretty bad," City Attorney Reed Moore told the station. "Sometimes you make those bad people pretty mad."
Hammer fled and was arrested later Tuesday, The Officer Down Memorial Page reports. He is currently in jail and has been charged with murder.
Proffitt served in the U.S. Army during the Korean War and served in law enforcement for 55 years before retiring in 2009. He had been shot in the line of duty once before.
"He's a good friend to everybody," Moore said. "He was a really compassionate man. If he had to arrest you, he treated you with dignity and respect.".

Whilst it would be fraught with difficulties trying to obtain permission to hang netting from adjacent and opposite buildings along a street in central London, hanging nets across this busy market street in Mumbai does reduce the risk of materials falling onto persons below.
Yes it would be ideal to have edge protection at every level on the building but on the basis that it would be difficult to police the use of edge protection these nets do catch falling debris.
But I also think these nets would instill complacency.
If these nets are also intended to provide protection for persons working at high level then safety netting is the preferred fall arrest option since it provides collective protection and does not rely on individual user discipline to guarantee acceptable safety standards if using a harness.

Kipp, Jacob W., Military Review
Russian discussions have connected redeployment of nonstrategic nuclear weapons to NATO enlargement However, in 1999 military discussion of these weapons concerned their potential role in theater warfighting as a counterweight to Russia's declining conventional capabilities.
A DECADE AGO it seemed that nonstrategic nuclear weapons were losing their place in superpower arsenals. In fall 1991, the Bush administration announced a series of unilateral moves to reduce, redeploy and abolish certain nonstrategic nuclear weapon systems. A week later Russian President Mikhail Gorbachev pledged that the Soviet Union, in the chaos preceding collapse, would dismantle all atomic land mines by 1998, all nuclear artillery shells by 2000, half of all surface-to-air missile warheads by 1996, half of all tactical naval warheads by 1995 (with the other half stored ashore) and half of the bombs of the nonstrategic air forces by 1996.1 In January 1992 President Boris Yeltsin of the Russian Federation announced that Gorbachev's initiatives would apply to Russia. Because nonstrategic nuclear weapons were widely deployed among the successor states, bringing them under Russian control proved a challenge.2 In 1997 one scholar commented that eliminating nonstrategic nuclear weapons seemed like the logical next step but warned that, in the face of NATO expansion, senior Russian military and political leaders were contemplating reversing the 1991 initiative.'
While US-funded programs brought many nuclear weapons into secure storage facilities, two questions arose regarding Russia's unilateral initiatives. The first concern was weapons security and unauthorized transfers to third parties.4 The second concern was Russian military plans for the other half of its surface-to-air missile warheads, tactical naval warheads and bombs.5 The emerging answer relates to Russian threat perceptions, national security policy and military doctrine. It also invokes a larger geostrategic issue: was the postCold War era of proclaimed strategic partnership ending and a new, interwar era in Russia's relations with the West beginning, in which preventing war gave way to preparing for war?
The NATO air campaign over Yugoslavia sharply deteriorated US-Russian relations. The Russian debate over nonstrategic nuclear weapons shifted from the adequacy of the existing unilateral regimes and prospects for some arms-control and confidencebuilding measures to the utility of such weapons for theater warfare and conflict management. By early January 2001 the Russian military reportedly had moved tactical nuclear weapons into the Kaliningrad area.6 These reports brought a rapid denial from the Russian military.7 Nikolai Sokov considered such a deployment unlikely unless triggered by a second round of NATO enlargement. Sokov further proposed new negotiations to transform the unilateral regimes into an arms-control agreement.8 Sokov correctly states that Russian discussions have connected redeployment of nonstrategic nuclear weapons to NATO enlargement. However, in 1999 military discussion of these weapons concerned their potential role in theater warfighting as a counterweight to Russia's declining conventional capabilities. Much of that discussion assumes that the United States and NATO represent the probable or eventual enemy. This article addresses the doctrinal debate that has emerged over nonstrategic nuclear weapons' role in theater war and their utility in deescalating such conflicts.9
Strategic Nuclear Forces, Kosovo and Theater Deterrence
In May 1997 Yeltsin fired retired General Igor Rodionov as Minister of Defense. Rodionov had spent a year fighting with civilian leaders over the proper course of military reform. Pressured to confine reform to the armed forces and focus on personnel reductions, Rodionov warned that NATO expansion could cause Russia to increase a nonstrategic nuclear threat on its western frontiers. "We might objectively face the task of increasing tactical nuclear weapons at our border. …Start your search today!

).Chelsea: efficient, functional, impressive but still just a bit dull
The season is barely two weeks old, and already Chelsea are looking ominous. Three games, three wins, the blue machine is already cranking through the gears. The only thing missing? Entertainment.
Their performance at Craven Cottage on Sunday perfectly encapsulated my image of this Chelsea team: functional, efficient, impressive but essentially a bit dull. They possess great power and poise within their squad, magnificent athleticism and control, tangible self-belief and confidence. Yet despite all this, Chelsea leave me cold.
I can admire their will to win, their relentless ability to churn out results, their frightening power. I think Frank Lampard is a wonderful player, as are Michael Essien and Didier Drogba, Petr Cech and Ricardo Carvalho. I rate Chelsea as the most daunting side in the Premier League. Yet for all this, they do not entertain me, they do not move me to the edge of my seat. They are admirable in so many ways, but they do not excite.
I am well aware that the bottom line in football is to win. There are no points for artistic impression, blah blah blah. And I would accept that I am a purist and subscribe to the Arsene Wenger school of thought: that teams have a responsibility to entertain their paying public. Ardent Chelsea fans will no doubt insist that watching their side win week after week is entertaining. But is it really? Surely a bit more flair would not go amiss at Stamford Bridge?
Ever since Jose Mourinho bounded into West London, Chelsea have, in my eyes, come to represent footballing pragmatism. The only time they have erred from the script was during the ill-fated spell of Luiz Felipe Scolari, in which their star shone brightly for a short, glorious period before burning out just as rapidly.
Guus Hiddink restored the status quo at the Bridge, and on early impressions Carlo Ancelotti seems to have no plans to rip up the Chelsea blueprint.
Yet when the Italian was appointed, we were told that Roman Abramovich's order was simple: to create a flair team with a clear identity. We are still in the early days of Ancelotti's reign, so it is perhaps unfair to judge his methods already, but his diamond formation does not seem designed for flair. Maybe a late transfer window addition will change all that. Maybe the arrival of a stellar name such as Franck Ribery or Alexandre Pato will instigate a change of policy, but Chelsea insist they will do no more business in this window.
I hope Chelsea prove me wrong. I hope Ancelotti is just settling in and the players are just getting used to his methods. Maybe next week they will dazzle and enthrall, playing the kind of football that has attracted millions of fans to Manchester United, Arsenal and Barcelona. I live in hope, but little expectation.- !

Following misleading statements openly disrespect the fact-finding process of the Commonwealth by making these false statements. Most Zambians understand full well that it is impossible for anyone to declare knowledge of the outcome of a report that has not yet been completed, and in doing so, it is clear that he is attempting to improperly pressure the international organisation.
If the Commonwealth Secretariat so chooses to refer Zambia to the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group for investigation, their representatives should be allowed by all parties to conduct a free and fair independent investigation into the current situation in Zambia absent of any pressure from either opposition, government, or third parties.
Mr. Kabimba has instead blatantly violated due process by prematurely speaking on their behalf. This is not entirely surprising, considering his conduct before the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC), when he refused to answer questions and instead arrived with a violent mob of cadres. Shortly thereafter, President Michael Sata stunned the international community when he gave direct instructions to the ACC not to investigate his ministers without his permission. Such political interference with law enforcement represents just one of the grave violations of the Harare Principles outlined in the CDDR report.
It is deeply regrettable to us that the Minister of Justice continues to spread falsehoods in the public media. He has told the Post that the CDDR attempted to "sneak the document to the Secretariat," but in fact the report was distributed worldwide on February 12th and published online for anyone to download. Furthermore, many of the concerns raised in the document were earlier stated in a letter addressed to President Sata on Oct. 22, 2012, as well as contained in the open letter to the donor community published on June 6, 2012.
Yet, almost a month later, the government has still not made any specific refutation to the facts contained in the report. They have not explained why political parties have been banned from holding public rallies. They have not answered any of the well documented allegations of politically motivated arrests and jail terms against opposition candidates. They've given no answers to the questions we have asked concerning interference in the case of the Nchito-M'membe debt to Development Bank of Zambia, the rash of deportations to benefit their financier Rajan Mahtani, or the unlawful re-nationalisations and expropriations of private property. Nor have they explained the reasons behind their incitement of violence, as shown both by President Sata's orders to soldiers to fire upon citizens in Western Province, or to the repeated hoaxes of fake letters aimed at provoking hatred among different groups.
They have dodged all questions of corruption, particularly related to Mr. Kabimba's alleged influence over oil contracts and accusations of undeclared shareholdings in Midland Energy Zambia. Since coming into power, the PF have been enjoying their new powers, perhaps excessively. Mr. Sata and Mr. Kabimba have even founded a new company, called Ilunda Chalo, which will presumably conduct unknown business related to state affairs. Mr. Kabimba has indeed become a very rich man during his rapid rise to power, but as we can plainly see, he has also become morally bankrupt.
Instead, what they have done with admirable energy, is hurl defamatory insults toward me, including but not limited to "gold digger," "economic vampire," and "dog of war." I am flattered that the PF seems to think I am deserving of such attention, but these insults are hardly any substitution for the answers to the very legitimate and pressing questions we are raising. What, exactly, is this government afraid of? Keep in mind that the sole reason why we held the CDDR press conference in Johannesburg is because I have been preemptively denied permission to enter Zambia, which in and of itself represents a violation of my clients' right to counsel.
There is a strategy behind all the childish name-calling: the PF want to reduce this matter to a he-said-she-said, tit-for-tat exchange that is typical of daily partisan politics, but we refuse to be pulled into a schoolyard game.
The members of the CDDR take these allegations of violations of civil and political rights in Zambia very seriously, and will not rest until the government provides answers and is held to account.As expected Chelsea have been at the forefront of the January transfer window activity with Daniel Sturridge leaving for Liverpool and Demba Ba set to sign from Newcastle United.
Should the Ba switch be completed it would represent a one in, one out scenario for the Blues but one which still leaves them drastically undernourished up-front.
With Fernando Torres continuing to infuriate, have Chelsea actually improved or reduced their striking stocks?
We investigate the pros and cons of selling Sturridge and signing Ba.with your order of $99 or more!

Ask any parent and they are sure to tell you that the morning and late-afternoon drop-off and pick-up of their kids at school is a time of chaos and confusion. Cars, minivans and SUVs line up single-file, sometimes around the block, as one vehicle after another drops their child off in the respective drop zone.
Without highly visible school traffic signs, motorists don’t know where to go or what to do. Confusion is added by parents who drop their kids off where they shouldn’t as well as by kids who walk in front of and between cars. Kids and parents who walk or bike to school instead of drive can distract drivers if they are walking or biking where they shouldn’t be.
School zone signs and school safety signs can help drivers better navigate the school parking lot improving safety for everyone involved, including students, staff, teachers, and parents. For parents and students who walk or bike to school, school traffic signs are a must ensuring that pedestrians have a safe place to cross the street and go when entering and exiting school grounds. To enhance safety, many schools employ crossing guards equipped with school crossing signs to aid in this process.
As the majority of students today get to school by being dropped off by their parents or carpool, school traffic signs directing vehicles are a must. Most schools today have designated drop-off and pick-up school zone signs so that students aren’t walking in front of and between cars trying to make their way to school. School signs and symbols help guests and school visitors who may be unfamiliar with the school environment to navigate their way through the parking lot as well.
Though fewer and fewer schools today rely on buses, those that still do must post school bus signs so that everyone knows the designated area where buses enter and drop off the students. Because it may be more challenging for bus drivers to see pedestrians, such school bus signs help students to be on the lookout for exiting and entering buses as well.Well, it has been a while since I have posted TDF to the community. Such is life on spring break and the craziness of conducting a 3 three hour workshop and a concurrent session at a conference. Now I am in the middle of trying to get caught up.

Failure: “Many years ago, as a young physics teacher, I took great pains (and enjoyment) in designing all physics tests for my students after a particular lesson. I was not much for using the tests that come with the textbooks, but would rather cut and paste (literally) different test questions from different sources to make my test. Knowing that the 15 to 20 students in my class had grasped the knowledge to all different levels, the goal was to design a test that…”MORE.

The Better Block projects have allowed us to look at redevelopment of our community at the block level using the community’s knowledge base and activism in a way that provide the best solutions for the local neighorhood. From the outset, we noticed the need to have better historic data on the community so that we could show the project’s impact on everything from traffic speeds and walk/bike ridership increases, to economic impact and environmental changes.
Ean Schuessler, Right
In our second Better Block we partnered with Ean Schussler of BrainFood to create a readout of existing bus locations, time of arrival, and final destination information for a single bus stop at Edgefield and Davis. The application was built using DART’s existing “Where’s my Bus?” application, but distilled the information so it would be more easily accessible at the local stop level. This began the conversation of creating more tie-ins with our work to civic application development. Cities across the nation have been adopting programs like Open311 which can provide a bridge for social media and 311 services that allow residents to upload images of problems like broken streetlights, potholes, and graffiti, which then provide a platform for these issues to be tracked and managed online. In 2005, Portland’s transit authority (TriMet) led the opengov charge by opening it’s bus and rail data to the public. Since that time, 30+ applications have been developed by the tech community which have made life easier for residents needing to navigate the city. Last year, NYC launched its BigApps competition, and San Francisco has now created a government data clearinghouse site called DataSF which has begun opening up the possibilities for civic application development.
So with this in mind, we’re now developing BlockCamp…an initative that will tie in our Better Block project with civic application development. Our first event will be held on Wednesday, Jan. 19th at Eno’s (upstairs), where we’re inviting all tech guys and gals who are interested in civic application development and open government to beer and pizza and conversation on how we can build a better Dallas. It’s open to all…click here to view the Facebook event and hope to see you all there.

Larry Richards, a Marine reservist and retired Los Angeles County sheriff's detective, died Saturday of natural causes. He faced multiple charges and had been scheduled for an Article 32 hearing, akin to a preliminary hearing.
The case involves allegations that Marines working for Richards in the intelligence division at Camp Pendleton gave him classified documents about purported terrorism threats so he could share them with an anti-terrorism task force organized by the Sheriff's Department.
Richards, in his job as a sheriff's detective, was a co-founder of the task force, based in Norwalk.
Richards, 52, died at his home in Lake Arrowhead after staying in a hospice with brain, kidney and liver ailments, according to the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department and the county coroner.DUBLIN, Ireland —.

“ ”I'm just going to go ahead and recycle the same lede I've been using since late January—the Philadelphia 76ers lost.
With a 120-98 defeat at the hands of the Houston Rockets at the Toyota Center on Thursday night, the Sixers tied the NBA record for consecutive losses with 26, a deflating streak that dates all the way back to Jan. 31.
ESPN Stats & Info confirmed their unfortunate new place in the record books:
76ers: lost 26 straight games, tied with 2010-11 Cavaliers for longest single-season losing streak in NBA history— ESPN Stats & Info (@ESPNStatsInfo) March 28, 2014
Unfortunately for The City of Brotherly Love, it's a record that isn't only contained to the NBA. According to ESPN's Adam Schefter, it extends to the four major North American sports:
A 26th straight loss for 76ers tonight would tie all-time record for consecutive losses in 4 major pro sports leagues in North America.— Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) March 27, 2014
Eesh.
Jose3030 puts some other depressing numbers on the Sixers' season, as well as offering up a potential new logo:

Speaking of tanks, there is good news here. The Milwaukee Bucks beat the Los Angeles Lakers, 108-105, on Thursday night, meaning the Sixers were able to "gain" a game in the race for the most ping-pong balls in the draft lottery.
NBA on ESPN gave an updated look at the standings, while NBC Los Angeles' Shahan Ahmed put it simply:

Losers tonight: Lakers, Bucks Winners: 76ers.— Shahan Ahmed (@shahanLA) March 28, 2014
If you've been paying attention, Thursday's result is probably one of the least surprising outcomes you've ever witnessed. In fact, Nate Silver and FiveThirtyEight's statistical models gave Philly a whopping four percent chance of winning:
Even if they don't win tonight, the 76ers (@Sixers) are getting better. pic.twitter.com/AArJfj8tHW— FiveThirtyEight (@FiveThirtyEight) March 27, 2014
The Sixers fought hard for a while. They trailed by just seven points after one quarter thanks to Casper Ware's half-court buzzer-beater, and they were within two midway through the second period.
But the Rockets were able to do whatever they wanted on offense, and as the team's Twitter feed pointed out, James Harden notched a triple-double in a mere 31 minutes:
Rockets win! Beat 76ers 120-98 behind @JHarden13's 2nd career triple-double - 26p/10r/10 in only 3 quarters of play. pic.twitter.com/Oh8R5fj3Jb— Houston Rockets (@HoustonRockets) March 28, 2014
Of course, there were some positive takeaways. James Anderson poured in 30 points on 11-of-18 shooting, and Henry Sims, who has played well recently, had 18 points and showed maximum effort despite the difficult situation:
Amount of quit in Henry Sims status update: Still zero— Andrew Unterberger (@AUgetoffmygold) March 28, 2014
With some encouraging individual performances, there is some hope the Sixers won't soon own this record all by themselves. As Jose3030 shows us, Philly next hosts the Detroit Pistons, who are mostly out of playoff contention and 2-8 in their last 10:
76ers upcoming schedule: Sat 3/29 Pistons | Mon 3/31 @Hawks | Wed 4/2 Bobcats | Fri 4/4 @Celtics | Sat 4/5 Nets |— 3030 (@jose3030) March 28, 2014

What can you do with such animals? The immediate obvious answer is: Nothing. Let them be! But this is an unsatisfactory answer for two reasons: (a) It's illegal to "own" undeclared wild sheep. (b) These animals could stray onto the road and provoke an accident.
So, I would like to eliminate them. But how? That's a good question. The only solution, I fear, will consist of my asking officially the gendarmerie to authorize the physical elimination of all these wild sheep with the technical assistance of local hunters.

It would be difficult to find any program in the country that has more excitement surrounding it than Tennessee does, even in the wake of four consecutive losing seasons.
Fourteen newcomers will bring a serious injection of much-needed talent, and with so many players exhausting their eligibility from Derek Dooley's disastrous three-year tenure, it truly is the dawn of a new era on Rocky Top.
If all 32 UT signees make it to Knoxville, 54 of the 85 scholarship players on the 2014 roster will have been recruited by Butch Jones before the first snap of his second season. That's a ridiculous roster flip, but given the lean years at UT, the changes are tinted with positivity.
There will be a quarterback battle, excitement surrounding highly touted mid-termers and a sense of urgency among returning players needing to make a serious statement. Competition breeds better football.
So, let's take a look at the 10 players who stand to benefit the most from spring practice on The Hill.You can browse through the codes from the link above, or even can download after a free registration!

Do you want to hear the story of left hand, right hand?
The Night of the Hunter joins the ranks of such movies as John Carpenter's The Thing, It's a Wonderful Life, and The Shawshank Redemption as a now classic that was initially shunned upon its theatrical release. Famed English actor Charles Laughton (Spartacus, Witness for the Prosecution, The Hunchback of Notre Dame) made his directorial debut with The Night of the Hunter and after a critical drubbing and terrible box office receipts The Night of the Hunter ended up being his sole directing credit. Criterion is finally bringing this Robert Mitchum classic to Blu-ray in a newly remastered edition.
Set during the Great Depression of the 1930s, The Night of the Hunter follows Rev. Harry Powell (Robert Mitchum, Cape Fear, Scrooged), a methodical serial killer who is caught stealing a car and thrown in jail. His cellmate ends up being Ben Harper (Peter Graves, TV's Mission: Impossible), a bank robbing killer who's about to meet the wrong end of a noose for his crimes. Before being put to death Ben Harper informs Harry that he's hidden ten thousand dollars and his children (Billy Chapin and Sally Jane Bruce) are the only ones who know where it is. After Ben's death and Harry's release, the slithering Powell makes his way to Ben Harper's widow (Shelly Winters) and children under the guise of being a man of God. This sets off a chain of events that will force the wills of Ben Harper's two children, as Harry proceeds to do everything in his sinister power to find Ben's hidden treasures.
The Night of the Hunter is one of the eeriest, weirdest, and darkest films to come out of the Hollywood studio system in the 1950s. Released in 1955 to poor critical reviews and even worse box office returns, the film became actor Charles Laughton's one and only moment in the director's chair. A shame, then, that we never got to see what else Laughton had up his sleeve for this is a film made by a master of the genre. The Night of the Hunter is like a living, breathing nightmare that features a stellar performance by Robert Mitchum as the screen's most vile preacher imaginable.
Laughton's The Night of the Hunter is something of a marvel considering its timing and history. The 1950s are not remembered as a time of complexity or darkness -- in fact,.
Mitchum is surrounded by a wonderful cast, not the least of which is a fragile Shelly Winters (The Poseidon Adventure) as Powell's unsuspecting new wife and eventual victim. Her final moments on screen are undeniably chilling and part of what make this film so evocative. Hollywood legend Lillian Gish is sufficiently religious and loving in her roll as an elderly matriarch almost pulled in by Powell's ruse, and Peter Graves (Airplane!) has an effective cameo in the beginning of the film that gets the ball rolling on the story. I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the two child actors -- Billy Chapin and Sally Jane Bruce -- and their almost otherworldly performances. Sally Jane Bruce is especially good, all innocence in the face of Powell's corruption.. There has simply never been another movie like The Night of the Hunter (skip the 1991 made-for-TV remake starring Richard Chamberlain). Laughton may have been dismissed as a director in 1955, but in 2010 The Night of the Hunter is now a classic of the first order. Highly recommended.
The Night of the Hunter is presented in 1.67:1 widescreen 1080p. This new transfer -- scrubbed clean of any debris, scratches or dirt, looks absolutely fantastic. If I recall correctly MGM released this years ago in a non-anamorphic transfer. Criterion has corrected this mistake by bringing the black and white photography into sharp focus. While not perfect, this transfer is so sharp (with a fine grain that gives it a warm filmic look), fans will be more than happy with upgrading their old DVD version.
The soundtrack is presented in LPCM 1.0 in English (the only available audio mix, and really the only one that you'll need). Taken from a 2001 restoration, this master audio mix is crisp, well mixed and solid in terms of dialogue, music and sound effects. Although your sound system may not get a huge workout, this is an accurate representation of the original soundtrack. Also included on this disc are English subtitles.
The following is a quick rundown of the special features included on this 2-disc Blu-ray set:
"Commentary Track" -- a great commentary featuring second unit director Terry Sanders, film archivist Robert Gitt, critic F.X. Feeney and author Neal Jones. This commentary covers a lot of area, including Laughton's life, the film and its history.
"The Making of Night of the Hunter" -- a documentary that features interviews with producer Paul Gregory, second-unit director Terry Sanders and other historians and crew members,
"The Ed Sullivan Show" -- an except from the classic talk show featuring actors Peter Graves and Shelly Winters performing a deleted scene from the film.
"Simon Callow on Charles Laughton" -- Author Simon Callow discussing Laughton's work and life, focusing especially on his directorial debut.
"Moving Pictures" -- a short documentary on The Night of the Hunter that features interviews with the cast and crew (Mitchum, Winters, Gish, director of photography Stanley Cortez, etc.).
"Staley Cortez" -- a 1984 interview with the director of photography discussing his work on the film (and in general).
"Charles Laughton Directors 'Night of the Hunter'" -- a comprehensive two and a half hour film that is an essential for any fan of the film (or of Laughton in general). This film features outtakes, behind the scenes footage, interviews, stills and much more.
Finally there is a "Davis Grubb Sketches" section (in HD), an introduction featuring Robert Gitt and critic Leonard Maltin and a 30-page booklet with two essays on the film.
Criterion has done an absolutely fantastic job on The Night of the Hunter. With a bevy of extra features, a beautiful transfer and nice audio mix, this is a no-brainer for fans to pick up.
The Night of the Hunter is an easy recommendation for any classic film
lover!

NORTHRIDGE, Calif. ---
CSUN Hosts Tigers, Aggies in Race to Big West Tournament
The Cal State Northridge women's basketball team (12-11, 6-5 Big West) returns to The Matadome this week for a pair of important Big West Conference contests. On Thursday, Feb. 14, the Matadors host the league-leading Pacific Tigers in a 7 p.m. game. Two days later, CSUN meets UC Davis in a 2 p.m. affair in which the Matadors will wear pink uniforms as the team participates in the Women's Basketball Coaches Association "Play for Kay" Initiative to promote breast cancer awareness. Fans wearing pink to the game against the Aggies will receive free admission to the contest.
Last week, Northridge split its two contests on the road, winning at UC Irvine before losing at Long Beach State. At the home of the Anteaters, the Matadors rallied from a four-point halftime deficit to outscore UCI 2:1 in the second half and leave with a 16-point victory. Marta Masoni connected on five 3-pointers and had 18 points while Ashlee Guay dished out 10 assists and Violet Alama grabbed 12 rebounds.
Two days later, CSUN saw an eight-point lead in the second half evaporate as the 49ers earned 24 trips to the free throw line over the final eight minutes. Despite making only three field goals over that same span, the 49ers were able to walk away with a 70-63 victory after making 18 of those 24 attempts at the free throw line. Guay led all scorers in the game with 24 points.
This week CSUN gets a chance at redemption against two teams that have already handed it a defeat earlier this season. Pacific is 18-5 overall and 8-3 in Big West play despite dropping home games to Cal Poly and UC Santa Barbara. The Tigers feature four players averaging double-figures in scoring and Kendall Kenyon is averaging a double-double at 11.7 points and 11.0 rebounds per game. Pacific defeated CSUN 60-51 in Stockton, Calif., earlier this season.
UC Davis comes calling to the San Fernando Valley Saturday. UCD carries a 10-12 overall record and 5-6 conference mark into the weekend and will play Hawai'i on Feb. 14. Sydnee Fipps leads the Aggies in scoring at 17.1 points per game and is averaging 4.6 rebounds and 1.5 assists per game. Cortney French is averaging 11.7 ppg and has hit 50 3-pointers this season. UCD took a 61-46 decision over CSUN earlier this season.
A Guay with Words
Sophomore.0 assists per game.
Meet the Meteoric Marta Masoni
Freshman Marta Masoni continues to have a strong first season with the Matadors. She ranks second on the Matadors in scoring and sixth in the Big West Conference at 12.4 points per game. Masoni has connected on a league-high 65 3-pointers this season and needs just two more to establish a new school single-season record. Through 21 games, Masoni is averaging 12.4 points, 3.3 rebounds and 1.6 assists per contest. In Big West Play, Masoni is averaging 11.5 points, 2.9 rebounds and 1.5 assists. She leads the Big West Conference in 3-pointers (65) and at 38.5 percent from beyond the arc (65-of-169). She has connected on a season-high six 3-pointers twice, reaching the mark in wins over UC Irvine and UCLA. In the win vs. Long Beach State, Masoni scored 19 points, including a season-high six free throws, and then added 20 points and in the first grabbed a career-high 16 rebounds to go with eight points in the loss at Long Beach State. Two days earlier, she came off the bench to block six shots in the win at UC Irvine. She enters the weekend averaging 6.3 points, 8.1 rebounds and 2.4 blocks per game. Her 56 blocks this year rank third in school history for a single season and with 101 blocks in 54 career games, Mahlknecht is fourth in school history. In Big West Play, Mahlknecht is averaging 5.6 points, 8.9 rebounds and 2 finished with a season-high 18 points, eight field goals and seven assists in the Matadors' loss at CSU Bakersfield. For the season, she is averaging 8.7 points, 3.3 rebounds, 2.8 assists and 1 47 career appearances for the Matadors. In Big West play, Sharpe is averaging 7.2 points, 3.4 rebounds and 2.1 assists.
Violets are Matador Red
Senior Violet Alama has ramped up her rebounding over the last three games, reaching double-figures in all three contests. She now has 643 rebounds in her career, which stands sixth in school history. She had a season-high 12 boards in the win at UCI, added 10 at LBSU and posted 10 more in the Matadors' loss to Hawai'i. Alama is now averaging 6.0 rebounds per game, the 12th-best average in the conference. She scored a season-high 11 points in the Matadors' loss to Penn State in the CSUN Thanksgiving Classic. The day before, she pulled down nine rebounds in the Matadors' win over South Alabama. Alama opened the season with eight points and eight rebounds in the Matadors' season-opening victory over Portland. She also has 223 career free throws, the eighth-most in school history. In 112 career games, Alama has averaged 7.0 points and 5.7 rebounds per contest. 84 career games with the Matadors, White has averaged 4.4 points, 2.6 rebounds and 2.4 assists.
Georgia on My Mind
Sophomore Randi Friess continues to earn large playing time due to her hustle and defense. Through 22 games, the second-year player from Savannah, Ga., is averaging 4.4 points, 4.2 rebounds, 1.0 points and 2.9 rebounds for the season.
Conference and National Notes
As of Feb. 11, CSUN leads the Big West in field goal percentage defense (.358). The Matadors also rank second in the conference in scoring defense (59.7), rebounding offense (41.7), turnover margin (+2.3), offensive rebounds (14.3) and steals per game (11.4).
Among 343 teams in Division I as of Feb. 11, CSUN ranks 32nd in steals per game, 45th in field goal percentage defense, 60th in blocks per game, 58th in 3-pointers per game, 77th in 3-point field goal percentage defense and 79th in turnover margin. Freshman Marta Masoni checks in at 22nd in 3-pointers per game and 41st in 3-point percentage. Camille Mahlknecht ranks 19th in the nation in blocks per game while Ashlee Guay is 33rd in steals per game and 119.Last August, it appeared the Amarillo Venom might go the way of the dinosaurs before Stephanie Tucker stepped up and purchased the team — keeping indoor football in Amarillo.
Five games into the season, the Venom looked like anything but a postseason team with a 2-3 record and enough quarterback/kicker problems to make Charlie Brown sympathetic.
As of Saturday, the Venom are the best team in the Lone Star Football League — capping off a remarkable turnaround with a 62-40 win over the Rio Grande Valley Magic in the league championship game in San Angelo.
The Venom won their last seven games — giving Amarillo its second indoor football championship and its first since 2004.
What sparked the rebound?
There are a few reasons:
■ Tucker, who had reason to celebrate as Saturday was also her 11th wedding anniversary with husband, Toby, is everywhere. Tireless would be a good way to describe the Venom owner. And her players love her.
■ Venom head coach Julian Reese has led Amarillo to a championship as a quarterback in 2004 and as a head coach in his first full season. I spent two days this past weekend traveling with Reese and his team on the Venom bus. They like having a good time, but they like to win more.
■ Picking up quarterback Nate Davis, a former fifth-round NFL Draft pick, and kicker Jason Cunningham, a former Tascosa Rebel and all-America, solved the biggest problems the Venom had midway through the season — and they were off and running afterwards.
Reese, who got a Gatorade bath in the final seconds of the title game, was almost in tears following the trophy presentation, saying he was thinking of his parents.
“I’m just so happy for the guys,” Reese said. “This team ... so many guys stepped up and so many of our guys stayed here when they could have played in other places. It makes you very proud of the whole team.”
Venom wide receiver Raymond Johnson, a former West Texas A&M Buff, had his best game of the season and was named the championship game MVP with eight catches for 154 yards and three scores, including an over-the-wall touchdown catch in the fourth quarter.
“I am so proud of my teammates and I’m so proud of Coach Reese. I’m proud of everybody in this organization” Johnson said. “We’ve all come a real long way.”

Great news. Congrats on bringing home the trophy. My only good question is that this was played in front of 500 fans, when if it was played here, there could have been 5000 fans (or however many we fit in the Civic Center). Maybe the league would change the venue location next year?
Good job Coach Reese and Owner Tucker, and the rest of the Venom Team!!
You make Amarillo proud.
I agree, the team had a great turn around and the new owner is great,, I hope they hang in there and keep it going. Good job bringing in some new players mid stream.
I have to agree with the other person,, why play it in San Angelo,, Amarillo would of been a good venue and the civic center would of been full plus the revenue that would of been made.
I think Amarillo could do well moving to a larger league with the current ownership.How to completely delete a Windows 7 installation ?

Windows installation problems: frequently asked questions
Here are some answers to common questions about installing Windows.
How do I upgrade my computer from Windows XP or Windows Vista to Windows 7? How do I get a product key? How do I make my computer start from the Windows installation disc, rather than the computer's hard disk? What can I try if I get a message saying there is a problem copying files? If I see a blue or black screen or a screen that doesn't change, is my installation broken? How do I install Windows 7 on a netbook? How do I fix a device, like a monitor, sound card, or printer, that doesn't work since I upgraded to Windows 7? Will my programs work with Windows 7? Can I try reinstalling Windows if my computer loses power during installation?.
Windows 7 installation problem
I was re-installing windows 7 and during the installation my computer turned off. Now when I turn my computer back on it won't let me resume the installation of windows 7. I do not have the windows disc because my computer came with windows 7 on it.
I've tried to use the F8 commands to fix it but nothing seems to work. I am just trying to some how get windows files that are still on my computer to work and let me re-install it.
Winodws 7 install
When trying to install windows 7 from an iso mounted on my pc, I click custom installation and the connect to the internet options and it starts copying files and after about 30% it jumps to 100% and says:
Windows cannot copy files required for installation. The files may be corrupt or missing. Make sure all files required for installation are available, and restart the installation.
WHY THE HELL IS IT DOING THIS.
Problem installing programs
Last week I bought my new computer and installed Win 7 Professional 64bit. Everything seemed to work fine, but some installations (which worked on my laptop with Win XP) cancelled with strange errors. I thought this was due to my 64 bit installation of Windows 7, so I reinstalled Windows with a 32 bit version. (If someone asks if they are legal versions: yes they are). But the installation problems were still there.
It seems as if my Windows installation says some .cab files which I try to install are corrupted.!)
How.
Cannot do an upgrade installation
I have a Win 7 Pro 32-bit installation on a HP desktop with a quad-core processor. I have been unable to install either SP1 or IE9 using Windows Update, although all other updates through and including those om the July Patch Tuesday did install successfully.
I decided to do an in-place (update) installation of Windows 7 SP1 using the appropriate downloaded file. When I try to install, I get an error screen that says that I must have the SP1 update installed before I can do an upgrade installation with a SP1 disk.
Since the point of doing the upgrade was to include SP1, this seems to be a catch-22.
Repair Install Win7 Without Installation CD
Is it a way to repair your installation of windows 7 without the CD/DVD. I ran sfc /scannow and it found several corrupted files within windows 7. I do not know how to go about and fix it. I Checked the CBS.Log file an seen some errors..
Windows 7 Installation Guide / Tutorial
The installation process was just like vista setup and to my surprise completed in just around 20 minutes in my low end Virtual hardware. This surely indicates the performance improvements Microsoft has put on this windows vista replacement.
Upgrading from Windows XP to Windows 7
A custom installation is more complex, and it can sometimes take a couple of hours to complete. We created this five-step tutorial to help guide you through the entire process each step of the way.
We highly recommend that you print this tutorial. Your PC will restart during the Windows 7 installation process, so having a printed copy will help you follow the steps if you're unable to return to this webpage.

Microsoft Windows 7 SP1 update fails to install all the time.It failed a total of 6 times.Taking a 3.5-4 hours installation time period
What I tried to do:1)Use Microsoft Fix Tool
2)Windows Default Troubleshooter
3)Installation in Clean Safe Mode
4)Use of Junction.zip
It just fails to install on restarting.
A list of errors it showed when I tried to install it are as follows They in the order of the date I tried

How do I get a race on the Calendar?LITTLE FALLS, Minn. - The man accused of killing two teenagers who broke into his Little Falls-area home on Thanksgiving Day is due in Morrison County District Court Friday for hearing at which he will challenge evidence against him.
Byron David Smith, 65, faces two counts of first-degree murder for the deaths of cousins Nicholas Brady, 17, and Haile Kifer, 18. The hearing Friday is expected to last the balance of the day.
Smith has been free since posting $50,000 conditional bail after he was initially charged with second-degree murder. A grand jury later indicted him on first-degree murder charges.
Smith is accused of killing Kifer and Brady after the two broke into his house north of Little Falls. Smith shot the teens multiple times and left their bodies in the house for a day before authorities were notified, according to a court complaint charging him.
Smith told investigators that he was acting in self-defense when he shot the teenagers, a claim that prosecutors and investigators are challenging. The shooting sparked debate about how much force homeowners can use when protecting their property against an intruder.
Morrison County Sheriff Michel Wetzel said immediately after the shootings that Smith exceeded that amount of force when he shot the teens after previous gunshots had rendered them incapable of being an ongoing threat.
Court records accuse Smith of shooting Kifer and Brady several minutes apart after the teens broke into his house. He told authorities that his home had been previously broken into.
Surveillance equipment captured video of the break-in, and a digital audio recorder caught audio of the shootings, according to court records.

February 8, 1999The hottest hand of all
By Michael Visontay
Ever since we left uni, our group has been playing poker. It's a safe haven where losers know the winners buy the hamburgers, the winners end up losing, and everyone speaks candidly about what really matters. We call it truth in gambling.
The biggest loser is the Eyeman, blessed with a large wallet and bad luck. He is not allowed to miss a game. Next, the Flight Controller, famous for once thinking his straight beat a flush and losing big on it.
There's the Professor, who prefers to analyse than bet; the Share Trader, who reads books on the odds beforehand; the Engineer, who always bets big and wins; and me, the Hero, who once won 16 hands in a row and has been hated for it ever since.
Recently, with summer looming, the conversation turned to fire-fighting skills. Holding two aces with an ace on the table, I was feeling confident....
I began recounting my time working as a shelf stacker at Woolworths, when I accidentally knocked over a large extinguisher in the loading dock.
Foam started hissing out and there was no option but to pick it up. Within seconds foam was spraying everywhere and a crowd turned up to watch me wrestle the hose, which had a mind of its own. I succeeded only in dousing every person and every pallet around me with thick white goo. By the time it had emptied, the warehouse looked like Thredbo. OK, there was no fire but I had fought the beast and won.
The Eyeman went one better. One university summer he decided to throw a dinner party for 25 of his closest friends while his parents were away.
The night seemed to be a great success. Main course of veal marsala (cooked by the Croc Doc), lots of cheap plonk and friendly girls. His coup de grace was a chocolate fondue for dessert, cooked on six pyrex-type bowls filled with methylated spirits. We lit them and waited for the chocolate to melt.
Alas, the bowls melted before the chocolate. Suddenly one bowl split, the others followed suit and within seconds the table was alight, then the curtains. It became hard to breathe in the smoke and the guests rushed into the garden, led by the Engineer (he had sold his car that day and feared for the cash in his pocket).
Our host reached for his fire extinguisher and, after a few anxious moments, brought the blaze under control. Then he saw one last bowl flickering, and shot a burst of foam directly downwards into the metho. It worked perfectly. The flames bounced up high into the air and licked the curtains, sending new plumes temporarily around the room.
But I shouldn't be too critical. A few years back Croc Doc and I shared a Darlinghurst terrace. One winter's night, he was out and Space Invaders beckoned at the corner store.
After what seemed like only five minutes, I returned to find a thick wall of smoke flowing down the stairs from my first-floor bedroom. It was time to panic. Out into the street I ran, shouting "fire, fire", banging on every front door in sight.
The only person around was a derro. He didn't say a word as I dragged him into the house, pushed him up the stairs and told him to go have a look.
Two minutes later, he was lying face first on stairs, the top half of his body invisible, his back and legs prone on the stairs.
The fire brigade arrived, dragged him out and within five minutes had put out the fire. Apparently my air heater had tipped over and the hot air caused the carpet to ignite. All told the blaze was 100 square centimetres, the size of two hands. The Croc Doc came home and laughed all night.
Twenty years later, around the card table, they had just one question: what happened to the derro?

Ah uni days - one of the best nites playing cards I ever had was on a friends bucks nite. We had a pretty tame time about 10 guys who went to a chinese eatery and then about six of us kicked on to the guest of honours house where we played cards until dawn. The best game was called dickhead. Each player was dealt one card, the player must not look at his card. Instead places the card on his forehead so that all others can see it. Then you bet , trying to read whether the smirks from your competitors mean that you have a three or an ace. Doesnt sound so flash now but you had to be there.
we played that too. it was called manila mad dog. fantastic fun when you'd finished playing properly and were pissed or stoned. we occasionally play it now when we go away for a weekend

I was fortunate enough to carry out a year of study in the US and one of our favourite games was to walk into a semi-crowded bar 5 minutes apart and then from opposite ends of the bar order something with a loud Aussie accent. More times than not someone would hear us, buy us a drink and the locals would keep on buying them as long as we kept on talking with our "twang". Nights were slow in rural US!

ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:
This is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. I'm Robert Siegel.
Youngstown, Ohio is an old steel town that has spent decades trying to come back after its mills closed. In recent years, Youngstown has turned to research for high-tech manufacturing as a way to help area businesses grow and adapt. The city is still far from writing a story of economic redemption but people there say they feel the beginnings of a turnaround. This week, that effort got a boost from President Obama in his State of the Union Address.
NPR national political correspondent Don Gonyea has the story.
DON GONYEA, BYLINE: Ohio is a perpetual battleground state and the Youngstown area is an important base for Democrats. So, people here will tell you they're never completely surprised when a politician mentions their city.
Still, this was the State of the Union Address.
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Last year, we created our first manufacturing innovation institute in Youngstown, Ohio. A once-shuttered warehouse is now a state-of-the art lab where new workers are mastering the 3D printing that...
GONYEA: Three-D printing is a way to create complex objects that previously would have had to have been molded or drilled out, or made through any number of other manufacturing methods. The process is at the center of a new manufacturing research lab in Youngstown.
We're still on the ground floor here?
RALPH RESNICK: This is the ground floor. This was an abandoned warehouse.
GONYEA: In a downtown marred by signs of struggle and hard-times. But inside the lab looks like a trendy loft space with floor to ceiling windows.
RESNICK: Manufacturing is still looked upon as dark, dirty, dangerous. Advanced manufacturing today is not that way.
GONYEA: This lab in Youngstown is developing techniques factories in the region and elsewhere will use. It's not a factory itself with lots of jobs, but Resnick and other predict job growth in the region because of it, and the businesses that tap into it.
There is a spot not far from downtown that's popular with everyone from blue-collar workers to university employees to local business owners. The place is the Royal Oaks Bar.
LOUIE KENNEDY: This is the oldest bar in Youngstown, as far as a continuous bar that opened the day after Prohibition.
GONYEA: That's Louie Kennedy, the owner. His reaction to the president this week?
KENNEDY: I do love it when people drop Youngstown bombs. You know, 'cause you just never know when somebody's going to drop Youngstown. I'll be honest, when you live here you just kind of think the rest of the world forgot about you.
(LAUGHTER)
GONYEA: Fifty-six-year old college Professor Vernon Haynes is seated next to Kennedy. He says the research being done in Youngstown is a positive step for city, even if it not yet something that the average person here has any real connection to.
VERNON HAYNES: I think most people around here are unaware of what's going on. There may be the occasional article in the local paper. But beyond that, there are a lot of things going on below the radar here that are the positive things going on in Youngstown.
GONYEA: That was echoed by 35-year-old Joe Shelby, a union carpenter.
JOE SHELBY: I think the things that are going on with the start-up businesses downtown are wonderful. You know, and there is stuff happening. I personally don't know anybody who's working for these companies but I read about it all the time.
GONYEA: Which gets us to those questions about jobs: how many, who'll get them and what they'll pay. The 50,000 lost steel jobs aren't coming back to Youngstown. But the notion of something new being created here offsets the uncertainty, especially with the talk around town - and even from the White House - finally being about what's possible rather than what's gone.

Theory and empirical evidence recognize interactions between capital and risk. This paper analyzes the effect of reinsurance, as a new endogenous decision variable, on this policy mix using simultaneous equations model. Empirical results obtained from a sample of U.S. property-liability insurance firms reveal significant interactions between capital, risk, and reinsurance. The relationship between risk and capital is positive, highlighting the effectiveness of regulatory mechanisms. Reinsurance is negatively associated with capital, for which it appears to act as a substitute. These results are strongly sensitive to the level of capital held in excess of the regulatory minimum requirements. Weakly capitalized firms adjust their reinsurance and risk levels more extensively and try to rebuild an appropriate capital buffer. Unlike other decision variables, the capital ratio converges toward a target.

Unlike many other shearwaters, the Black-vented
Shearwater is a coastal species, most often seen within 15
miles of land. It breeds only on remote desert islands off the
Pacific Coast of Baja California, within productive up-welling
zones of the California Current. These islands are characterized
by having little vegetation and no native mammalian predators.
A large percentage of the population nests on a single island,
Natividad, Baja California Sur, where numbers are estimated
at some 75,000 pairs.
On Natividad, however, there has been
considerable mortality from feral cats. One model estimates
that the population growth there will decrease by 4% annually
with the presence of cats but that the population would be
stable if the cats were removed.
Like many other tube-nose seabirds, the Black-vented Shearwater
nests in burrows or rocky crevices and is nocturnal, making
it a difficult species to study. During nonbreeding it ranges
as far north as Monterey Bay, California, and south along
the coast to central Mexico, as well as in the Gulf of California.
The overall breeding population is thought to be decreasing.
Among the threats to the species is degradation
of habitat. Natividad Island is inhabited and a town has been
built on what was once some of the densest nesting habitat
on the island. In addition, there is a road through the colony
and a trash dump as well. Island residents sometimes drive
through the colony at night, disorienting the birds. Rats
are unknown on any of the nesting islands and preventing their
introduction is a priority. There is a program on Natividad
to trap and remove cats and there are also programs to educate
the local population as to the conservation value of the island
and the importance of protecting the shearwaters. Goats and
sheep were removed from Natividad but the effect on shearwaters
is unknown.Over the past nine seasons, while working as an interpretative ranger at both Antietam and Gettysburg, I have met dozens —if not, hundreds—of visitors whose ancestors fought in the Civil War. Usually it is a great-great-great grandfather or great-great-great uncle, but on at least half a dozen occasions, I have had the great pleasure of meeting folks whose grandfathers served in the war. This happened most recently during the Sesquicentennial Anniversary weekend in September 2012 at Antietam when an elderly gentleman inquired of the location of the 9th New York/Hawkins’s Zouaves Monument. He was looking for it because, as he said, he wanted to stand upon the same ground where his grandfather had fought 150 years earlier. Talking further with this gentleman, I discovered that his grandfather was born in 1840 and that he had passed away at the age of 95 in 1935. The soldier’s grandson, who in September 2012 stood before me at the desk at Antietam, told me that he was ten years old when his grandfather died. Curios, I asked if his grandfather had ever discussed the war with him when he was a young child. The man simply shook his head no and said that it was something they just didn’t talk about.
To be able to point out and physically connect a visitor to a particular part of a battlefield where their ancestor—or at least their ancestor’s regiment—served, is a great and satisfying feeling and one that I have had the privilege of doing countless times over the years. Many times the visitor’s face will light up when I circle on a map where their ancestor served; other times, their eyes swell with tears knowing that they would be able to stand where their ancestor fought and where, on some occasions, their ancestor fell. Usually after doing this, I am myself asked if any of my ancestors served in the war. It is a question I have been asked many, many times over the past nine years. And the answer is a simple no. Indeed, as far as I’ve been able to discover, none of my direct ancestors were even in the United States during the 1860s. They were, instead, many thousands of miles away, scattered across Eastern Europe, and another five or six decades would pass even before any of my ancestors finally made the long journey to America.
I, thus, may not have any direct, ancestral ties to the Civil War but there are still many personal connections I can make to the war’s great battlefields. During my years at Antietam, for example, I had a strong connection to the southern end of the battlefield, to the famed Burnside’s Bridge and to the ground where the 9th Corps made the final Union attack on that bloody Wednesday, September 17, 1862. It was there where the 48th Pennsylvania served and where they lost some 60 men. The 48th Pennsylvania was recruited from my hometown, from my native Schuylkill County, in the east-central portion of the Commonwealth. Growing up, studying the Civil War, I focused in on this particular regiment. I studied its service, its experiences, and the soldiers who composed its ranks. I frequently visited their graves. Indeed, in my hometown of Orwigsburg, a small community of just 2,500 or so people, lies buried the remains of Corporal Lewis Focht while only a few miles away, in Cressona, lies the remains of Private George Dentzter. Across Route 61 from Cressona is Schuylkill Haven and there is buried Corporal Daniel Moser while only a few miles further north, in Port Carbon, is the grave Lieutenant William Cullen. All of these soldiers were members of the 48th Pennsylvania, and all gave their lives at Antietam. For me, finding something of a personal connection to Antietam was thus not that difficult. But Gettysburg would be a little bit harder, for the 48th Pennsylvania—and the entire 9th Corps for that matter—was simply not there, not present during the battle. I would thus have to dig just a little deeper to find those personal connections.
Of course, by the time I began working with the NPS at Gettysburg, the place was already very—very—familiar to me. As a young kid, growing up only two hours away, I came to the fields of Gettysburg countless times on family vacations or on simple day-trips, and in 2004, my wife and I moved here, years before my first season began in the Gray and Green at Gettysburg. So, there has always been a connection for me to Gettysburg—but it was a deeper connection I was seeking and, during my first season here, I found it. I found it while developing an interpretative program on the National Cemetery when I came across the name—and the story—of William Beaumont and his brothers.
The story of the Beaumont brothers really struck a chord with me because of its connection to my native Schuylkill County and its connection to my own family’s history. As alluded to previously, it was not until the early 1900s before any of my own ancestors arrived on America’s shores, with the hopes of carving out a new life for themselves and for their families. On both my paternal and maternal sides, it was my great-grandparents who made the journey, settling ultimately in Schuylkill County where my great-grandfathers immediately went to work in the coal mines. It would be an occupation followed by their sons as well, including my maternal grandfather—my mom’s dad—Nicholas Mitsock.
Nick Mitsock was born in Schuylkill County in April 1927 and raised in a coal patch near Minersville. He went to the local schools before service called him away to Europe. He served in Germany during the waning days of World War II, a truck mechanic, or so I have been told. Following his discharge from the army, Nick Mitsock returned to Schuylkill County and once more took up the pick and shovel of the coal miner. He met my grandmother. Soon after they were married and five children followed as a result. Their first—my mom—was born in 1951 and was thus only six years of age when her dad—my grandfather—left home one late May morning in 1957 and never came back. Nick Mitsock was only thirty-years old when he was killed in a mine collapse, leaving my grandmother a widow, my mom fatherless and forcing her to help raise her four young siblings. After several days, his body was recovered and his remains laid to rest in the town of St. Clair.

So, what, then, does this have to do with the Battle of Gettysburg and the story of the Beaumont brothers?
Some eighty or so years before my great-grandparents immigrated to America and found a home in Schuylkill County, a Mr. William Beaumont arrived. Born in England in 1811, William Beaumont immigrated to America, presumably in the late 1820s or early 1830s. He found a home in St. Clair and went immediately to work in the coal mines. He met a young lady named Mary and the couple had six children. Their eldest son, George, was born in 1834. Their second son, William, arrived six years later. In 1842, John was born and their youngest son, Charles, was born two years after John, in 1844. As the boys got older, they followed in their father’s footsteps, finding work in the coal mines near St. Clair. Then the war began, and all four sons made the decision to leave their picks and shovels behind and take up the weapons of a soldier, fighting in defense of their father’s adopted country.
George, William, and John Beaumont volunteered their services first, soon after the outbreak of hostilities, when all three enlisted into the ranks of Company A, 88th Pennsylvania Infantry. As the youngest of the Beaumont boys, Charles was only 17 when the war began and thus could not officially enlist until the following year. He did so, joining up first with the 129th Pennsylvania Infantry in the summer of 1862 and later with the 7th Pennsylvania Cavalry, seeing considerable service in the war’s Western Theater before returning safely home in 1865.
Having offered their services, it was not long before George, William, and John Beaumont became good soldiers. Fighting side-by-side, the three brothers made it unscathed through the Seven Days’ Battles, 2nd Manassas, and Antietam, where the 88th sustained heavy losses in the infamous Cornfield. By the summer of 1863, they were battle-hardened, experienced soldiers fighting in a well-seasoned, veteran regiment, which, by the onset of the Gettysburg Campaign, had been whittled down to fewer than 300 soldiers remaining in its ranks.
At Gettysburg, the 88th Pennsylvania formed part of General Henry Baxter’s Brigade of General John Robinson’s Second Division, First Corps. The regiment arrived on the field sometime before noon on July 1, 1861 and was initially assigned to a reserve position near the Lutheran Seminary. As a defensive measure, the men, including the Beaumont brothers, immediately began throwing up fence rails, erecting make-shift barricades. But when Robert Rodes’s Confederate division arrived on Oak Hill, further to the north, General Abner Doubleday—who had taken command of the First Corps following the death of John Reynolds—needed troops to meet this new and developing threat. Robinson got the nod and Robinson, in turn, called upon Baxter and sometime after noon, Baxter’s men—the 88th included—raced their way northward along Seminary Ridge, across the railroad cut to Oak Ridge, where they settled into position behind a stone wall. It would not be long before they became heavily engaged. After helping to turn back several Confederate attacks, the soldiers of the 88th Pennsylvania ran low on ammunition and their spot on the front would be taken up by soldiers of Robinson’s Second Brigade under Gabriel Paul. Relentless pressure from Rodes’s Division, however, simply became too much for Robinson’s men to bear and sometimes around 4:00 p.m. orders from Doubleday arrived to retreat. Driven from the field and back through the labyrinthine streets of Gettysburg, Robinson’s men ultimately rallied on Cemetery Hill.
In its action that day, the 88th Pennsylvania lost more than a third of its men, killed, wounded, captured, and missing. Panting, exhausted, George Beaumont made it safely back to Cemetery Hill. As he looked around through the wreckage—through what was left of the 88th—he could not locate his two younger brothers, for both William and John Beaumont were among the regiment’s casualties that bloody Wednesday. At some point during the battle on Oak Ridge, William was shot through the neck, while John was captured in the streets of town. Carried south with the Army of Northern Virginia in the aftermath of the battle, John Beaumont remained in captivity for just three weeks before being exchanged. He would return to the ranks of Company A, 88th PA, but brother William would not be so fortunate. His wound proved mortal, and he passed away on July 13. Later that year, William Beaumont’s remains were interred in the newly-established Soldiers’ National Cemetery, in the Pennsylvania plot, Row B, Grave #73.
It is not known whether William Beaumont’s grave had been dug by the time Lincoln arrived in mid-November to deliver his “few appropriate remarks” but his words, when they heard or read them, surely resonated with brothers George and John, still in the ranks of the 88th PA. Lincoln admonished the people of the nation—including those on the home front and those on the battle front—to rededicate themselves to the great task remaining before them, to see the war through to its conclusion, for there was still hard work ahead. In the winter of 1863-1864, both Beaumont brothers still in the 88th decided to reenlist for another three-year term of service and in a February 1864 letter to the editor of Schuylkill County’s leading newspaper best summarized the reason why when he wrote: “I have been in the service of my country two years and six months, but I am not tired of it. . . .I entered the service when the rebellion first began, and I am determined to see it ended.”
Sadly, John Beaumont would not live to see the end of the war. On June 18, 1864, four months after writing this letter, John was killed in action at Petersburg.
Next year, the war, at last, came to an end. George Beaumont was the only one of the three brothers who served in the 88th Pennsylvania to make it back home. He returned to St. Clair and to his family. He was married by then and may have had at least one child. He also returned to the mines. He sought, as best he could, to return to normal. But tragedy still hovered over the Beaumont brothers and on November 30, 1868—just three-and-a-half years after Appomattox—George Beaumont was at work in the mines when a large lump of coal fell down a 500-foot shaft that George just happened to be standing under. The coal struck George and he was instantly killed. A few days later, George Beaumont’s remains were laid to rest in St. Clair.
Some four score and nine years later, in 1957, my grandfather—Nicholas Mitsock—who like George Beaumont had been killed in a coal mine accident shortly after returning from war, leaving a widow and a young family behind—was also laid to rest, in St. Clair, very near the grave of George Beaumont.
It is important for all of us to find our connections—physical, emotional, or both—to the past and to its places, such as Gettysburg. You can find them if you look hard enough, even if you believe there are none to be found. Many visitors to Gettysburg have a direct, ancestral connection to the battlefields here; many do not. None of my ancestors fought at Gettysburg; indeed, none even served in the war. But there are still strong connections. I am reminded of this every time I walk past the grave of William Beaumont in the Pennsylvania section of the Soldiers’ National Cemetery. Seeing his name inscribed upon his granite footstone, immediately makes me think his brother George and of my mom’s dad—my grandfather—Nicholas Mitsock whom I never had the privilege of knowing; who, in fact, died long before I was even born.

Well done John!
Wow….beautifully written
Beautiful story. I cannot describe the feelings I have walking through the National Cemetery. Such hallowed ground.
John,
I assume that you would have provided them if available, but are there any known pictures of any of the brothers?
I am sorry to say that I have never come across a photograph of any of the four Beaumont brothers who served. I checked in all the sources but it seems there are none to be found. – John Hoptak

@kennthomas That's why you link bank or credit card and have them charge it. Not extra steps and your financial info can't be grabbed.
Only issue with my bank is they limit the number of ACH transfers out they do for free so I got charged a fee during a buying spree.
@kennthomas: You don't have to have a Paypal account to purchase. Rather than log into Paypal you you click don't have a Paypal account and enter your credit card information.
@kennthomas: hahahaha. OMG! That's SUCH a HASSLE! God forbid you've had to do something extra to get a good deal. Those extra steps! Such a deal breaker!

According to The Financial, Verizon's Access New Jersey Portal will provide the technology to the program established by the Goodwin Holocaust Museum and Education Center. The organization is hoping to educate kids about genocide.
Education director Helen Kirschbaum explained to the news outlet that video conferencing the event to schools all over the state not only educates the children, but is also very beneficial to the Holocaust survivors and the concentration camp liberators who want to tell their stories because they are already in their 80s and 90s.
"To ask them to go from school to school is very demanding, and it takes an emotional toll for them to tell their stories. This way, they don't have to repeat it five times," Kirschbaum adds.
The Goodwin Holocaust Museum and Education Center is using the power of video conferencing technology to spread awareness, including a discussion on Elie Wiesel, a famed author who told his story about his survival in a Nazi concentration camp..
Such chaos would almost inevitably lead to a call for mandated government-agency oversight of Hollywood accounting, and that, to studio thinking, would be Armageddon—albeit an Armageddon that would be celebrated by everyone who has ever been promised a net-profits check that didn’t arrive. In the space of just a couple of days this month, a jury demanded Disney pay $270 million in damages for wrongfully withholding profits on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, another found that actor Don Johnson was owed $23 million by the producers of Nash Bridges, and Nikki Finke’s Deadline website posted a leaked balance sheet in which Warner Bros. appeared to demonstrate that the movie Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, which grossed $938 million worldwide, is somehow $167 million in the red. Given that statistic, perhaps stockholders should inquire whether any studio movies ever realize a net profit, and if not, why the people who run those studios are still employed..POLYBOTES was a Gigante who fought Poseidon in their war against the gods.

New Project Walk Franchise To Open Its Doors in Houston
Project Walk recently announced that it will be opening its newest franchise in Houston, Texas.
Tim Yates, Project Walk CEO, articulates the company’s excitement in opening the location, “The owners of our Houston franchise have a passion and personal connection to the injury. They have a deep love for the Houston community, which makes them a natural fit, and a welcomed addition to the Project Walk family.”
The owners, Mark and Cindy Dremely, have a son Brooks aged 18 years old, who was injured in a motorcross accident in January of 2013.
Cindy notes that as a mother of an individual who has sustained a spinal cord injury, “I understand how important it is to have additional avenues for therapy. Project Walk has provided more than just an improved quality of life for Brooks physically, but mentally as well. The kind of support you feel at Project Walk is second-to-none.”
With nearly two decades of experience and based upon the Dardzinski Method, Project Walk specializes in activity-based recovery. Its approach aims to improve function below the level of injury and to improve quality of life for people impacted by mobility-related disorders.

af theycallmeballsdeep 28. marts 2009Sure I am a Steelers blogger and look at stuff concerning the Steelers with my black and gold glasses on most of the time. In the latest power rankings that ESPN put out that ranks the tight ends, they have Steelers tight end Heath Miller ranked 13th overall and Miller received just 2 top 10 votes from John Clayton and ESPN North blogger James Walker. If they are basing their power rankings on the 2010 season alone, which it seems they are in the case of Miller, then the drop off in production that Miller had statistically in 2010 versus 2009 might be some what of a valid argument. In defense of Miller, he did miss 2 games and a portion of another due to a concussion he suffered against the Ravens. Miller also is an integral part of the running game and logged nearly 850 regular season snaps on offense despite the two games he missed. Buccaneers tight end Kellen Winslow Jr., who finished 7th in the power rankings, did not even log 700 offensive snaps and Packers tight end Jermichael Finley logged just 212 snaps before being lost for the season. Seems to be some bias here or at the very least inconsistent reasoning.
Although his numbers were down in 2010 versus 2009, Miller rates as perhaps one of the leagues most reliable tight ends since he was drafted in 2005. Over the course of 6 seasons, Miller has been targeted 396 times during the regular season and has caught 284 of the balls thrown his way for a 72% catch percentage. That percentage is tops in the league for that span when compared to other tight ends that have been targeted 200 times or more over that span of 6 seasons. Also during that time span Miller has averaged 8.1 yards per target. Once again if you compare that to other tight ends that have been targeted 200 times or more since his rookie season, Miller ranks 3rd, just barely behind Cowboys tight end Jason Witten in that stat. During his 6 years in the league, Miller has started 90 of 96 regular season games and has been part of 3 teams that have gone to the Super Bowl and news flash, the Steelers won two of them.
As Walker points out in his blog post, Miller remains underrated as far as top tight ends in the league go. Miller is a model of consistency, a model teammate and a model tight end in the Steelers system. This is just another example of how little these power rankings mean and how you often times need to look at the entire body of work a player brings to the table as well as his consistency. One and two year wonders will always be around. I by no means think that Miller should be ranked overall number one on this list, but to to not have him in the top 10 in the NFL is foolish. I am glad he is on my side. I will never underrate him.Risk and Protective Factors of Children and Adolescents Who Were Hospitalized Due to Alcohol Intoxication (RiScA)

“I also realize that this may not be the most politically favorable thing for me to be doing,” he said. “Based on a lot of different reasons. But understand that I do so in good conscience, because – God forbid – if a tragedy like this happens in my backyard, I want to know that I did everything legally possible to ensure that this would not happen.”
Rep. Matt Shea, R-Spokane, said the bill could limit access to firearms for lower-income people looking to protect themselves.
“I would not have that on my conscience, and therefore I would urge a no vote,” he said before the committee roll-call vote.
Rep. Jamie Pedersen, D-Seattle, the bill’s sponsor, said the legislation was written with the constitutional right to bear arms in the forefront of the lawmakers’ minds. By expanding the background checks that are already in place, the bill simply closes loopholes, he said.
These loopholes have enabled people like convicted felons and those with protection orders to gain access to guns, he said.
“It won’t solve every tragedy, but it is a simple and important step that I think we can and should take,” he said.
Though the bill is favored by the Democrat-controlled House, the Senate, which is controlled by Republicans and two crossover Democrats, is less likely to give it an easy path to the governor’s desk.
If it’s any indication, the measure’s companion bill in the Senate, SB 5625, has yet to receive a hearing in the Senate Law and Justice Committee, which is chaired by a Republican.Published on

Dogs may be man's best friend, but all animals collectively are close to Massachusetts' economic heart, generating more than $1 billion a year in revenue through many businesses.
In everything from biotech labs to drug developers, veterinary practices, pet and grocery stores, zoos, farms and even colleges, animals create thousands of jobs.
A 2008 study found veterinary medicine generated $1.3 billion in 2006 in Massachusetts alone and $3.3 billion in New England, accounting for 32,000 jobs. Compiled by the University of Massachusetts' Donahue Institute, the study focused on veterinary medicine's economic impact on New England.
In Massachusetts, among industries indirectly impacted by veterinary medicine were drug and medical manufacturing, on which was spent $34 million. About $375 million was spent on commercial scientific research and development, and 186 veterinarians specialized in academic or life sciences research.
Lindsay Koshgarian, research manager at the Donohue Institute, said although the report is dated, its findings are probably still valid.
“It doesn't seem there's been any permanent stop to growth in the veterinary industry resulting from the recession,” she said.
Researchers at Tufts University's Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine in Grafton have created or helped create spinoff businesses, some selling products or services used in animal care, and others involved in highly sophisticated medical treatments.
Dr. Deborah Kochevar, dean of the Cummings School, said only a handful of Cummings researchers have created companies, but there are many faculty-generated patents. Tufts administrators help researchers obtain patents and market them for licensing to outside companies, she said. Dr. Saul Tzipori, professor of microbiology and infectious diseases, has been granted six patents in the last 20 years, she said.
The dean said a patent is pending on a potentially major discovery by Dr. Charles Shoemaker, a professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases' Department of Biomedical Sciences. The discovery — the research on which was aided by alpacas — concerns antibodies that help fight toxins.
“I predict that thing will be a winner. We all have antibodies,” she said. “Few people other than those in a veterinary school might know how to exploit them. It is a great example of how you can use the diversity in the animal kingdom to benefit both animals and humans.”
Much of the Cummings School's research funding comes through the National Institutes of Health and seeks cures for human diseases through observing animals, Dr. Kochevar said. “You can't really separate the two.” Most drugs used to treat animals today were first developed for people.
The school's $70 million budget includes $9 million to $12 million in research funding. Besides NIH, it also seeks funds from the U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, the National Science Foundation, Environmental Protection Agency and Food and Drug Administration as well as foundations and private companies outsourcing research.
Cummings' biggest research division has studied infectious diseases for 20 years and has drawn $120 million in research funding to the school, most of it from the NIH. Starting with AIDS-related research, it grew into studying food and waterborne diseases such as botulism and E. coli bacteria.
Cummings' link to NIH helped secure funding after the 9-11 terrorist attacks to build its New England Regional Biosafety Laboratory.
“It was funded at a time when the government was particularly interested in biodefense,” Dr. Kochevar said. Now the lab studies antidotes for anthrax — a potential terrorist tool — and tuberculosis.
Although some think veterinarians care only for pets, the animal doctors also work in medical research and pharmaceutical development. Massachusetts is second only to California in the economic importance of biomedical research.
“It (veterinary medicine) is an important industry from the perspective of pet ownership. But it is much more than that. Most biomedical research involves animals, and there is no one better to safeguard the use of animals than veterinarians. The vet school plays a role in all those things,” the dean said.
The Cummings School's relationship with Tufts Medical Center helps veterinarians work with physicians on diseases shared by animals and people. One faculty member treating head and neck cancer works at both Cummings and Tufts, studying similarities between human and feline cancers.
“There are many cancers that are similar in dogs and in people. The knowledge that has been gained that's applicable to all species has exploded and so has technology,” said Dr. Lisa Barber, an assistant professor of clinical sciences and a board-certified oncologist at Cummings School.
Dr. Melissa Mazan, director of Cummings' equine sports medicine program, said veterinarians focusing on farm animals safeguard public health. “This is the entire country's food supply. If we don't pay attention to that, we're asking for trouble.”
Animals can also warn humans of impending problems, Dr. Mazan said. Some researchers treating horse respiratory problems noticed their owners were also coughing. Study showed dust in barns was affecting both horses and riders.
Dr. Andrew Hoffman, director of Cummings' Lung Function Regeneration Laboratory, said companies fund animal studies as a prelude to research on human diseases.
“It is a great marriage. Diseases that occur in our day-to-day patient load can assist in drug and device development,” he said.
Also, if human health care providers want to reduce costs, they should study how veterinarians do it. “I have to know the price of everything. In human hospitals, nobody knows the price of a single thing,” Dr. Mazan said.
The Cummings School has also played both a direct and indirect role in the start of private companies whose products often serve both people and animals. Many of them are veterinarian offices throughout Massachusetts.
“They generate employment, and the people in the office provide services to the public that are tax-bearing services,” she said.
Dr. Susan Board Gillham, a Maryland native and mother of two who graduated from Tufts' veterinary school in 1993, set up a solo practice in 1995 in Westboro called Associates Animal Hospital.
Today, she employs two additional vets and has a staff of 11. She estimates in 2011 alone, including salaries, taxes and purchases, she pumped $322,000 into the economy. “It has been close to that for nine years,” she said.
“If Tufts was not there, I would not be a veterinarian. It played a huge role. A lot of other people tell the same story,” she said. Her friends include fellow alumnae with practices in Shrewsbury, Stow and Hopkinton and others doing research in Boston and Germany.
The Cummings School, for all its economic activity, receives only a small portion of its budget from the state.
While other vet schools rely on state funding — often as much as 40 percent — 4 percent of the privately operated Cummings School's $70 million budget comes from the state. In dollars, that is expected to be $3.2 million this year.ROTTEN SIGNING: Saturday 12-8-12, Odyssey Comics and Coffee, Vancouver, Wash.

But, I figured, why blow all this great stuff on just one post, when I could have a blockbuster franchise on my hands? If “The Fast and the Furious” is already in its sixth iteration, then at least a sequel to “Eureka!” seemed totally justified. Herewith, a supplementary selection of inventions from our cartoonists.
Frank Cotham suggests a shoe attachment that could be activated on demand to produce an intimidating height advantage when dealing with difficult people.
Ken Krimstein has the perfect answer for those watching their weight:
These babies vanish before they even hit the bun. Woof!
And with the grillin’-and-chillin’ season just around the corner, what could be better than this un-thought-of (until now) combo, by Michael Crawford?
Of course, even though cartoonists are the most creative people on the planet, not everyone could come up with something in time. Here is an e-mail I received from Mick Stevens:
Bob,
I’ve been trying for a couple of days to come up with something for your invention blog. Try as I might, nothing came to me. Time’s running out! Maybe what I need is this:

I am a concerned resident of Lakeside Subdivision in Paradise. The town is having some work done on the section of Topsail Road from McNamara Drive to just past Glenderek Drive. So, over the next three to four months, there will be periodic detours through our subdivision, as well as the adjacent Vista Crest subdivision. Work started early on Friday, Aug. 16, and I quickly realized how much traffic will pass through during the course of this construction.
I understand the necessity of the work and detour. My concern is with the speeds at which some people are driving through this residential area. I have seen many vehicles pass by our home at speeds significantly higher than the posted limit of 30 kilometres per hour. We are close to an intersection and vehicles are taking the turn onto our street at high speeds and accelerating up the hill.
Getting in and out of our driveway has become a high-risk endeavour. In fairness to these drivers, the contractor and/or town had only seen fit to place one speed sign at the entrance to our subdivision on Aug. 16. This sign seemed a distant memory to most after travelling just a few hundred feet past it.
I first contacted town officials late Friday morning after watching our subdivision turn into a speedway before my eyes. Since that time, there have been numerous emails requesting more signage (I also indicated signs are not enough), speed bumps and the presence of Municipal Enforcement and the RNC. The general response has been that they are monitoring the situation.
Sometime over the weekend, I noticed a couple signs on the short section of Lanark Drive which is affected by the detour. Vehicles are halfway through the detour by the time they reach these signs. After contacting the town again on Monday, I arrived home on Tuesday afternoon to find a couple signs on our street and a digital sign on Lanark Drive (again, halfway through the detour) reminding drivers of the speed limit.
I guess this could be considered progress. However, after watching traffic for an hour or so late Tuesday afternoon, I confirmed what I had previously indicated to town officials — signs are not enough! I again emailed town officials and advised them of this. At least with a few speed bumps, people have little choice but to slow down if they want to avoid damage to their vehicle. There have been speed bumps in place for quite some time on a number of roads in our town. I am not sure of the reason for all of them, however, I see no reason why there can’t be a few placed in these subdivisions during this construction period.
On Tuesday evening, I decided to attend the town council meeting with the hope of getting my point across and getting some answers. Not being allowed to speak at the meeting, I sat patiently and waited for the issue to be discussed. The outcome of the discussion was essentially that they would continue to monitor the situation.
Apparently, the RNC and Municipal Enforcement are patrolling the area. I am unsure whether any vehicles have been stopped and/or ticketed. Believe me, a strategically placed RNC officer would quickly develop writer’s cramp from issuing tickets, especially during the morning and evening rush hours.
Unfortunately, despite their statements to the contrary, I do not feel the town is taking these concerns seriously. They have a responsibility to the tax-paying residents of this town to ensure public safety is first and foremost.
Something further needs to be done before someone is hurt, or worse, killed.

What is it with the people that speed? I know of 4 people that recently visited St. John's and area, they were in absolute disbelief at how many people break the law there when it comes to speeding and running stop signs. One guy said he counted three cars that went through a red light before he could go on his green. Speeders, please tell us why you are in such a hurry, so much so that you are risking yourself and innocent people, hopefully not killing anyone. Are you going to the hospital with a life threatening sickness? Are you a Doctor that has to go to save someone's life? Is it because you can't stand to have someone in front of you? It is a proven fact that with dangerous driving that you only get to your destination, maybe five minutes before a person driving with prudence. So, speeders please tell us why you speed?

I've tried all sorts of things including intercepting when a scroll bar appears, and trying to modify this jquery autosize plugin, but I can't get it to work properly.
Can anyone suggest the best way to go about it, or is there already a plugin to do it?
Thanks
How are you fixing the font-size? I assume you are aware that users can over-ride in their browsers any css styles that you apply.
A way to get started on this is to remove the scrollbar from the input element, and to then check if the keypress changes the size of the field.
.fixed {
overflow: hidden;
}
<textarea class="fixed"></textarea>
$('textarea.fixed').keyup(function () {

He has captured the most prestigious trophy in all of tennis and the admiration from the sports world. He will be enshrined forever as a tennis great during the Golden Age of men's tennis, and he is the hero of Great Britain after becoming the first British male player to win Wimbledon since 1936.
He is a living tennis legend.
Congratulations Andy Murray on becoming #wimbledonchampion pic.twitter.com/NCRsa1OKSF— BBC Sport (@BBCSport) July 7, 2013
Murray's quest to winning Wimbledon was a difficult and long-suffering route through triumph and adversity. Perhaps no player in tennis history has had to wear the burden of so many expectations and criticisms.
Let's take a look at Murray's epic journey through his astonishing career of resilience and growth.
Summer 2006: Hello, Tennis World
The Scotsman was a promising player as a junior, and at 19 years old, he announced himself to the tennis world by defeating the great Roger Federer. He broke the Swiss Maestro's 55-match hard-court winning streak at Cincinnati, one of only five losses for Federer's entire year. Murray's youthful form lacked pace, but the framework to his championship resume can be seen in these highlights:
Murray also worked with renowned coach Brad Gilbert and established himself as a top-20 player, showing the groundstrokes and defensive game that would become his specialty.
U.S. Open 2008: Just Happy to Be Here
He continued his ascent by briefly holding the No. 2 ranking in 2009. Nevertheless, this was a tennis landscape dominated by Federer and Rafael Nadal, and he would learn how difficult it was to compete for Grand Slam titles.
He defeated Nadal at the 2008 U.S. Open semifinals and got his big chance against Federer. It was short-lived and humiliating as he fell in straight sets. Murray could only lament in his defeat by stating the obvious, as reported by BBC Sport Tennis: "I had a great tournament but I came up against, in my opinion, the best player ever to play the game today."
It would be the first of many hard defeats for Murray in Grand Slam finals.
Australia 2010: Frustrations With Tennis Take Their Toll
Murray continued to grind away at the Grand Slam dream, but he was once again crushed in straight sets by Federer, this time in the Australian Open finals. There was more than ever a wide chasm between him and his bigger rivals who carted away the Grand Slam hardware.
The pressure was also building for Murray as the media questioned his mental strength. There were Davis Cup demands and pressure that took much of the joy away from playing tennis.
Mark Hodgkinson of The Telegraph elaborated on this with Murray's admission that, "It's not just that (Davis Cup), a lot of things that can be mentally draining and you can be subconsciously annoyed about or upset about and you need to make sure that you've got a clear head."
Murray was struggling to endure his stalemated progress. He said, "You just need to try and make sure you keep all of your problems and issues out of it and you go back to focusing on tennis, which is my job. Hopefully I'll be able to do that."
Australia 2012: Ivan Lendl Arrives
Murray hit the same wall in the next two years. He couldn't overcome Nadal, but now Serbian star Novak Djokovic, one week his junior, had roared past him. Djokovic entered elite company by kicking off 2011 with a dominating Australian Open victory over Murray. It seemed the torment would never end.
Was he the next Michael Chang: a good, solid champion who would take beatings from greater champions with bigger weapons?
The turning point may have been Murray's decision to hire Ivan Lendl as his coach. More toughness and risk was needed to combat his rivals. The alliance almost paid immediate dividends, as Murray pushed Djokovic to five sets in a classic Australian Open street fight. This was when his belief and toughness truly began.
Wimbledon 2012: "I'm Getting Closer"
Murray had a versatile game on grass with his slice forehand, improved serve and quick reflexes on returns. He had been a semifinalist three straight years, but now had marched on to the finals against an aging Federer.
Murray seized the first set and had Centre Court rocking like a Rolling Stones concert. He had more enhanced firepower on his forehand and the ability to win his first Grand Slam title.
But then the rains came, the roof was closed over Centre Court and Murray could not keep up with his longtime superior. The air and the life was sucked out of the stadium, and soon he was holding the second-place trophy once again.
He choked back tears in his post-match speech as he thanked the crowd. "All right, this is not gonna be easy," he said, unable to continue a speech.
He told Sue Barker of the BBC, as written by Sports Illustrated writer Bruce Jenkins, "I'm getting closer."
Olympics 2012: The Golden Breakthrough
It was quick redemption for Murray to get another crack at Federer at the London Olympics on Centre Court Wimbledon. The stakes were high with the men's singles gold medal on the line, and this time, it was Murray who delivered his greatest victory in a straight-sets thrashing of Federer.
It was more than a victory for Wimbledon. Murray had overcome the Federer obstacle and inched one step closer to fulfilling his promise as a Grand Slam champion. He was now a seasoned 25 years old and hitting his prime.
U.S. Open 2012: Finally a Grand Slam title
Murray would not be denied at the U.S. Open. First he had to endure gusty winds in a bizarre first set of the finals. Most of all, though, he had to endure Novak Djokovic's furious comeback.
Up two sets, Murray watched the next two sets evaporate as his Serbian rival produced blasts of power that defied even the elements. Murray's resolve was tested most, as he had to start anew in the fifth set with his momentum washed away and the agony of choking away his opportunity.
Murray passed his test with flying colors. He endured physical weariness and overcame another great champion. He finally won a Grand Slam title for Great Britain, the first man to do so since Fred Perry in 1936. The parade through New York never felt so good.
This burden had been lifted.
Murray said in his post-match interview (video inset), "I was very relieved...it means the world to me, what I've been working for definitely the last 10 years."
Australia 2013: Back to the Drawing Board
The second Grand Slam was not going to come easy. Murray lost a third consecutive match to Djokovic and had been overpowered at the baseline. The Serbian came into net for several winners and did not allow Murray a single break of serve as he captured his fourth Australian Open title.
For Murray, it signaled how far away the Wimbledon dream was. He was staring at another call to work harder and enhance his creativity. Many other players would have been satisfied, but not Murray.
Wimbledon 2013: Quarterfinal Scare and Comeback
After cruising through four easy matches, Murray suddenly found himself down two sets to veteran Fernando Verdasco. The Spaniard had attacked with big forehands, tough spin and experience.
Murray chipped away slowly, scowling but patient, locked into each point and showing his champion's mettle and poise. His rally was a triumphant success for his composure.
The comeback toughened him on his journey to the Wimbledon title.
Wimbledon 2013: Great Britain Has its Wimbledon Title and Great Hero
It was the finest performance of Murray's career given his play and the stakes of being the first British man in 77 years to win Wimbledon. He also had to slay Djokovic once more.
The Scot set the tone early with several break-point opportunities and then began to cash them in. There was visible relief in watching him capture the first set, but determination in fighting back from a 4-1 deficit in the second.
Murray is two sets up! 6-4, 7-5 to the Brit at #Wimbledon. #Djokovic still looking annoyed, could we see a John McEnroe eruption?!— TPF Tennis (@TPFTennis) July 7, 2013
Then he rode his talent to the finish line, out-hitting Djokovic and riding streaks of brilliant tennis. Though Djokovic was subpar, Murray took advantage and closed him out. His line read 6-4, 7-5, 6-4—the kind of beating he used to receive in Grand Slam finals.

Good to have you back - you have a happy kitchen!
Just stopped by to grab the widget...mother needs a new basic sewing machine. Drop in bobbin. :)
I keep looking at the yellow accents in your kitchen. The wood framing on my cabinets is a soft sage green/natural birch doors. I saw where they paired it with a fairly bright yellow on the window trim. I think I'm going to "steal" a bit of your look and paint the window molding over the sink and the kitchen door yellow. It should look good with my sunflower valances.
And I'm looking at my bookshelf. But it won't do red justice not like that wonderful cabinet you have. (soooo jealous!)
I love a warm and fun kitchen!
It helps too, that yellow and red are two of my favorites!

I love your kitchen. I love yellow, red, and cookbooks, too. My walls are yellow with hodge podge red accents. And I have things stuck places to make me smile, too. Thank you for sharing your pictures.
love your whimsical-ness! thank you for sharing your kitchen with us. I see all that brightness, and I look at my "earth toned" browns & greens, and think...I Need A Change...may have to happen soon! God's Peace!

Love your yellow and red, Brenda, esp the yellow cart! Those colors are my faves, too.
Amazing what a good find in a thrift shop does for the heart, eh? I found an old Revereware skillet like I long ago gave up...for only $6 and along with a nifty huge cast iron pot and lid AND handle, by Lodge (at $30 kind of spendy, but worth it to me)...I considered that a good day!! We are here in WA now, kind of "camping out" in daughter's house she hopes to soon sell, as they already bought another one. SO...need a few basics, with most of what I still have back in storage in NC. We are discussing maybe moving out here, though the other 2 kids and most of the grandkids are in NC...hard to have family scattered to the winds. But the one out here needs us now and till the children are school age, possibly. Hard to find good help these days...heh!!
Dear Brenda, I love your kitchen too! Thank you for sharing! Your photographs are beautiful and the charm and cheerfulness of your kitchen really makes me smile. It is always such a pleasure to visit your blog and find something beautiful, useful and uplifting. You are truly gifted in so many ways. Love Ruby xxx?

I'd absolutely take a split. 5-2 with 5 games to go? Heck yes.
Yes, I would definitely take the split

No, because we will beat OSU I think. I think we will already have a split at minimum.

This. I didn't even have to look any further. Why would you take a guaranteed loss? +1.
"Cyclones on the run!"
-John Walters
I would take it, because I think we have very little chance of beating KSU.
Probably wouldn't be too happy about it over the next couple of weeks, but at the end of the season if the split is the difference between bowling and staying home for the holidays, I'll probably look at it with a different it is right now, I'm looking for 2 wins, no matter what.
If it came down to bowl eligibility at the end of the year, and the split got us that, I'd be OK with it, like jdogg said.
Kansas Must Be Destroyed
Sic Semper Jayhawks
The only way I'd take a split is if that guaranteed us a conference championship, and then only if the national championship is out of the question.
Taking a split means accepting a loss, and like the wise person said above, I now believe we are capable of winning any game we play in. I think this program is past being ok with losses..- Im, Fernando Gabriel; Rosenblatt, David;

UPDATE: It seems there may have been lag in billing systems. Though it said zero balance when I checked online a few days ago, it has now updated to show this month and duhn duhn last month’s unpaid bill. I didn’t pay the bill last month because it also said then that I had a zero balance. There must be a definite lag problem that’s not just me because otherwise the CSR yesterday would have told me that I had to pay up, instead of suggesting I take advantage of a free upgrade for my iPhone 3GS… Brad the friendly AT&T PR rep says he’ll look into it. I declined his help and suggested that he solve the underlying issue for all consumers but not to give my account any special treatment.

Having garnered an international reputation as one of the leading artists to emerge from the New York Pictures Generation of the 1970s and 1980s, Simmons has thoughtfully and methodically moved through her various photographic series, such as Early Black and White Interiors, 1976–78, in which pseudo-realities are created by staging miniature spaces with dollhouse furniture and other banal props; and Walking & Lying Objects, 1987–91, a series of black-and-white photographs of inanimate objects animated with human legs. Her most recent bodies of work—Kigurumi, inspired by a sub-genre of Japanese “costume play,” and How We See—present a transformative social experience and relate it to our relationship with social media. She continuously updates and maximizes photography’s attributes, stating early on in the 1983 exhibition catalogue In and Around the House, “I love the photographic image, the way scale can become meaningless and everything is unified within the surface. I now see that that kind of ambiguity is what drew me to working with the camera in the first place.”
For this Tuesday Evenings presentation, Laurie Simmons talks about her most recent photographic series and her upcoming feature film.

Another, very interesting video is a tour of the ISs led by commander Sunita Williams 12 hours before her return November 19, 2012. It is 26 minutes long, but well worth the view. The link is below.
This is just too awesome!!! Even this 63 year old granny started rocking. Great for NASA and the students. Need to see more things like this to make the younger generation not forget about our space programs.
Very imaginative cover.
Eric Sim is adorable! Love that guy!
Between Gangnam Style and the new top priority of muslim outreach; nasa is doing awesome under the current administration! pffffff
This was done by students — as a side project no less to the 40-hour weeks they were working — participating in a program designed to attract the next generation of engineers to the space agency. How one could have an issue with that I have no idea.
Oh come on, “Truth”! What, do you hate puppies, too? This is creative, it’s funny, and it’s drawing attention to the space program. With any luck, some of the engineers of the future come for the fun and stay for the substance.
So we are yet again supporting the use of the Gangnam style music from the singer PSY who a few years back was part of a video where he rapped that Americans should be killed. I love it, where else can we have more of this stupid liberal idiocy!?!? You people sicken me and the fact that NASA would continue to promote this video/song is reprehensible.
I’m with you. Sick of seeing this nonsense!
Musicians do stupid things. Kanye West will forever be known for interrupting Taylor Swift’s acceptance speech. PSY has apologized for his actions:
We make mistakes. We learn from them. And this video has nothing to do with PSY- it has everything to do with NASA. My company put together one like this, and it was the most fun, company-spirited activity I have ever participated in. You can harbor whatever feelings you want toward PSY if that makes you happy, but don’t blame the students for it.
Great Video, props to those students who worked hard to show off the amazing people that work at NASA
Fun. Here’s more, LARGE, kid fun.

Location: Stainton, near Barnard Castle, County Durham
Event: 4 December 2011
Report: Snowdon Sports/Claire Crabtree
Hope Factory Racing’s Paul Oldham took victory at the North of England Championships at Barnard Castle, Stainton. Conditions were difficult as the race the previous day had cut up the course and with snow showers all day it was cold and muddy.
Oldham went to the front from the start of the race and increased his lead every lap to win with ease winning by over two minutes. Behind his team mate Jack Clarkson had to battle for second place, having taken a 15 second gap over Tony Fawsett and Lewis Craven he had looked in a good position for second but a hard working Craven had passed Fawsett and was hunting Clakson down and going into the last lap he had caught Clarkson but Craven made the decision to pit for a clean bike and Clarkson saw an opportunity to attack and took a small lead which looked to have settled the fight but with Clarkson making a mistake at a set of jumps Craven was back with him but Clarkson kept his cool to finish in second. Fawsett came through to finish in fourth with Keith Murray in fifth and with that Hope Factory Racing took the team prize.
Interview with Paul Oldham
“The race was wet, cold and muddy, I have had a cold this week so conditions were not the best for me but I wanting to come and win having taken the title four times previously and riding the race on the same course yesterday meant I did not need to pre ride the course this morning and get muddy twice!”
In the Veteran Race Wheelbase’s Noel Clough went off hard and took an impressive gap straight from the start which nobody else had an answer to. Chris Young tried to chase Clough down but he was marshaling the gap to finish comfortably with a 1:30 lead, behind Middleton was alone in third place with Ashbridge and Haygarth close for most of the race with Ashbridge getting the better of Haygarth to finish fourth.
Interview with Noel Clough
“I wanted to go really hard at the start knowing that Chris will come back to you, so I set off hard and on the first lap looked around and I had a larger gap then expected and was catching the juniors so backed I off a bit and kept him at the same pace and with two laps to go he had gone so just thought carry on and go as fast as you can”
Joe Moses took the junior title in a close-fought battle; Moses, Martin and Womersley working together at the front, each putting in attacks but non managing to get ahead. With half the race gone Moses put in an attack to gain a 20 second lap over Womersley who in turn had taken a small gap over Martin. In the closing stages Womersley started to tire and Martin came through for second and a strong last lap from Armstrong saw him come through for third.
In the Women's race Nikola Butler took the lead from the start with Bland keeping her in sight, with Butler having a coming together with a post Bland caught her back up but Butler managed to regain her advantage finishing with 27 seconds over Bland.
Interview with Nikola Butler
“I wanted to get a good start so the pressure would be off for the rest of the race but I had a coming together with a post and another rider and had a slip on a corner and dropped my chain which meant Lynn caught me but I managed to get away again by pushing on the tarmac sections and holding my nerve on the corners”
In the Youth race Paul Milnes team-mates Billy Harding and Seb Marsh set the early pace but early in the first lap Harding took control and quickly pulled out a 15 second gap with Hetton Hawks team mates Worton and Lee trying to stay in contention, with Edmond coming up to join them. As Lee dropped back it was a race for second between Edmond and Worton as Harding continued to pull away. Then in the last lap Edmond made a move and managed to pull out a good lead over Worton to finish second.

I’m not sure why, but I’ve always felt sales people and sales leaders can be some of the slowest adopters and critics of change. When things work, we stick with them. Sales people don’t change very quickly. It’s always been odd to me that people in such a dynamic occupation are so resistant to change. You’d think working in dynamic environment would attract dynamic people.
Sales isn’t changing. The science behind decision making is no different than before. The “immutable laws” of selling are strongly entrenched. They will never change.
- There has to be a need for change.
- There benefit of change as to be substantial enough to warrant the change.
- The prospect has to have confidence the outcome is achievable.
- The outcome must be persuasive enough so the prospect can get others on board.
- The prospect must be able to clearly see the process of the change and how it’s going to happen.
Although the basic laws of selling aren’t changing, how we address these laws is changing big time. The “how” of sales is absolutely evolving. What we used to focus on, the approaches we take and the tools we use are undergoing tremendous change. Some of us are embracing them, but just as many of us aren’t and it feels like the chasm is growing.
What do you think? Do you see the same thing? Are you seeing two camps of sales people? Is the chasm growing? If the chasm is growing, why? Why are so many of us NOT getting on board with the changes?Florida cheesemakers
As posted a couple of days ago, the only two places that may make mozzarella here are O'Stromboli on Corrine Drive at Old Winter Park Road and Harmoni Artisenal Market in College Park.
I don't know what kind of milk they are using.
I'd have to say that your impression of water buffalo everywhere probably isn't accurate -- I'm not aware of their widespread use in Central Florida at all.
There is only one commercial cheese maker that I am aware of in the area and that is a company over in South Brevard. The details escape me, but I probably have it in my files at work

i think that i may have actually seen a couple of these in lake county (around round lake road and wolf branch) ?? they looked like real buffalo though.
i don't think there's a big cottage industry as of yet in making cheese though.
maybe see if you can contact this fellow:
Hugh L. Popenoe: Member at Large, cattle and water buffalo rancher in Alachua and Levy Counties and Professor of Soils, Agronomy, and Geography at the University of Florida. He was Founder and Director of the Florida Sea Grant College, chaired the administrative committee of the Florida Water Resources Research Center, served as Director of the UF Center for Aquatic Sciences, was Vice-President of the Florida State Horticultural Society and Vice-Chairman of the Gulf Universities Research Consortium. He is a Founder and currently President of the American Water Buffalo Association.
Other than this startling revelation of a producer of buffalo mozzerella, cheese is just about impossible to have made/make in FL- high temperatures and humidity nix both healthy milk-producing animals and the process of cheesemaking. I've been trying unsuccessfully to find local cheesemakers in FL for a project, and after much research and talk with artisanal distributors throughout the country I've given up.

- After the blood clot forms, it is very important not to disturb or dislodge the clot as it aids in healing. If the clot is dislodged, the bone underneath the extraction site will be exposed, resulting in a painful condition called a dry socket. Do not rinse vigorously, suck on straws, smoke, drink alcohol, consume hot liquids or brush teeth next to the extraction site for 24 hours. These activities will dislodge or dissolve the clot and retard the healing process. Limit vigorous exercise for the next 24 hours, as this will increase blood pressure and may cause more bleeding from the extraction site.
- After a tooth is extracted, you may feel some pain and experience some swelling. An ice pack applied to the area will keep swelling to a minimum ?Äì 20 minutes on, 20 minutes off ?Äì for the first six hours following the extraction.
- Once the numbness has worn off, you should eat to provide nourishment, aiding in the healing process. You can eat normally, with the exception of hot liquids, as soon as you are comfortable. Limit your diet to soft foods, like yogurt, soft soups, ice cream, apple sauce and soft cooked eggs for the first 48 hours. Please keep up with your fluid intake, as well.
- Keep your head elevated with pillows to control bleeding when when lying down.
- Use pain medication as directed, if prescribed. Call the office if the medication doesn’t seem to be working. If antibiotics are prescribed, continue to take them for the indicated length of time, even if signs and symptoms of infection are gone.
- If sutures (stitches) were placed, they will dissolve in 10-14 days. If nonresorbable sutures were placed, Dr. Nguyen and staff will let you know to return for a suture removal appointment.
- The space left by the tooth will feel a bit strange to you at first. Eventually, new bone and gum tissue will grow into the gap left by the extraction. Depending on your case, a bone graft may be recommended at the time of extraction.

The director has stipulated that the actresses who take turns in playing Violet Beauregarde must be “non-white”. In a move that is likely to lead to accusations of crude racial stereotyping, the black girls should be skilled rappers with an impudent manner.”.
In a casting advertisement, the producers say candidates should be “a skilled rapper with a brash attitude”. The actresses, who must be aged nine to 12 and under 4ft 8in, should be “able to do an American accent”.
A spokesman tells Mandrake: “Young actors from all ethnic backgrounds are auditioned for the roles in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and our cast reflects this. Violet Beauregarde is required to rap in one of the show’s songs, so an ability to rap is an important skill for the part.”
The spokesman adds: “The directions in the advert are guidelines. The casting directors meet and audition children from all ethnic backgrounds all around the country, for all roles, and we will continue to cast the very best young actors we find.”

What's on your mind?
.
Several years after its publication, the novel continues to attract a following among adjuncts and full-time faculty members concerned about the state of the professoriate. Having been one of those graduate students who love their subjects, Duffleman wakes up in midlife and finds that he is a cockroach scurrying around the city, just trying to stay alive. Duffleman can't write his way out of being an adjunct; he hasn't written anything besides e-mails for years. And who would hire him anyway at this point? He fantasizes about going to prison, reminding readers of the Little Tramp in Modern Times.
Kudera was an adjunct in Philadelphia from 1998 to 2007, so the novel is an exposé and manifesto in the muckraking tradition, but it also has strong absurdist elements. In an e-mail Kudera wrote, "Cyrus has incrediblefeelings of inadequacy, marginality, deep-seated feelings of failure, based in part on the conditions surrounding him—the society that dictates he must work 12 or more hours a day and is not worthy of decent health coverage or pay, and that he is supposed to be grateful for this exhausting life. And yet, as with many overworked depressives, there are these moments of clarity that can include outburstsof extreme laughter, often at one's own expense." In addition to the usual rounds of composition and business writing, the "Duffler" teaches "The Literature of Post-War Male Loneliness and Despair."
Philadelphia is Duffleman's Dublin, and Fight for Your Long Day is full of symbolic moments and literary jokes that connect the novel to other works such as Solzhenitsyn's One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich, Blue Angel by Francine Prose, Philip Roth's The Human Stain, Richard Russo's Straight Man, Taxi Driver, and maybe even Robert Crumb's comics.
But the key to the novel is the moment when Duffleman draws Maslow's hierarchy of needs on the board for his students and asks them to explain each stage. Throughout the novel, we see characters' being forced lower and lower on the hierarchy, their chief joys consisting of being able to satisfy bodily needs. Never mind reaching the pinnacle of "self-actualization"—that's for politicians and corporate executives.
Ironically, it's that promise of ascending Maslow's hierarchy that leads so many people into academe, and turns them into Dufflemans. The role of the teacher—especially in the arts and humanities—is to be the embodiment of the fulfilled person: someone who is pursuing the life of the mind and realizing his or her full potential through discipline and intellect. In Duffleman's world, the nation and the institutions in which he teaches are presided over by money-mad mediocrities. They are eliminating entire humanities programs, except for the "cash cow" of composition courses taught entirely by adjuncts (for the brief remaining period before all such courses can be automated or outsourced to other countries with even lower wages).
He's devoted to his students, but Duffleman is racked by persistent anxieties, self-doubts, and dread. How can you teach, Kudera seems to ask, when you can't even provide for your own basic needs? When you have no job security? When you seriously expect that you will spend your retirement in a homeless shelter? Duffleman obsesses about food and elimination; he suffers from inappropriate sexual obsessions; he feels cut off from society; he is a prime candidate for suicide, and he looks at death as a release from his predicament. He is the least attractive representative of learning imaginable, and perhaps that's why he stands in front of the classroom.
His students are not pursuing the "life of the mind"; they are just trying to avoid a future of working on a checkout line. Many of them—especially the recent arrivals in this country—believe education is about being on the right side of wealth and poverty. They may be victims of extortionate tuitions—for many, their "inability to pay educational loans is the only sign of ever having attended college"—but most of his students have no illusions: They'd be glad to work for Big Tobacco if it offered job security and benefits.
And any instructor who plays a version of Robin Williams's Mr. Keating for students will seem like either a fool or a knave. Duffleman is the former, though not in a naïve or sentimental way. He is an idealist, a lover of books, a warm-hearted liberal, but he is also a prisoner of the contingent-labor poverty trap. The one other idealist in his classes—a young veteran trying to earn a degree—ends up being an inadvertent political assassin, a Travis Bickle, who launches the only real action of the plot, apart from Duffleman's weary journey from one teaching gig to another on his longest day of the week.
In a novel that includes a lot of exposition, Kudera is exceptionally effective in his depictions of classroom dialogues from the perspective of the teacher. At one point Duffleman even manages to spellbind his otherwise fractious, politically polarized students with the story of his own family's immigrant, working-class history: how they ascended the social ladder (at least until he came along).
But in another class, on the same day, Duffleman's students cross the line into vulgarity and racial epithets, insanity and physical violence, and he is left with a mixture of concern for his students and fear that he will lose his job for not being in control of the situation.
Kudera makes it clear that Duffleman, in a different novel from another era, would have been a beloved teacher—a Mr. Chips if there ever was one. He truly cares about his students; he'd love teaching if he weren't so tired all the time. He wanders from one job to another, a Ulysses of exhaustion and futility, until we find him, at the end of the day, shielding one of his students from the bullets of the military-pharmaceutical complex that runs Liberty Tech University.
What is the purpose of this novel?.
Fight for Your Long Day is not without problems.. Just like the political-thriller elements of the novel, the sexual detours seem to cater more to the perceived demands of the book market than to the actual life of an adjunct. (And Kudera has written one of the most intentionally awful sex scenes I have read since I Am Charlotte Simmons.)
That's not to say that all adjuncts must be depicted in positively heroic terms, but it seems counterproductive to create a character whose moral flaws are so egregious—and personal habits so gross—as to erode or even destroy any sympathy we might otherwise have for his plight and, by extension, that of adjuncts everywhere.
I was not pleased by the novel's ambiguous conclusion, either. It's hard to make a proletarian hero out of an adjunct, but I wanted Duffleman to be awakened to a more radical, activist consciousness. Maybe the novel could end with his joining a unionization movement. Or maybe he could become a dead hero, somehow, whose martyrdom sparks others to action. No such luck. Kudera's vision seems ultimately dystopian.
Duffleman is a sinner, no doubt about it. But he is also a Good Samaritan, a role model in that respect. You never doubt his heart is, ultimately, in the right place.
Fight for Your Long Day merits renewed attention amid the continuing tendency of politicians on the right, and even the left, to blame tuition increases on the salaries and privileges of elite faculty members, who are not representative of the working conditions of most college teachers. Those of us who have written about the plight of adjuncts are often asked, "Why don't you write about something more serious—major evils such as war or genocide?" But the idea that one cannot address what appear to be smaller evils, like the private hell of a Duffleman, seems like a slippery slope toward moral apathy. More important, the situation of contingent academic workers is not isolated but representative.
Ostensibly about the plight of adjuncts, Duffleman's long day is a nightmare from which millions of workers are trying to awake. Trapped in positions of subordination, insecurity, and fear, Duffleman is an Everyman for the new American economy. And Kudera's novel merits the attention of everyone who cares about that.Big Tops.
The interactive aspect of the "Phreniti-scopes" is something found in many other Seiler works; usually the viewer must manipulate some kind of mechanical element in order to get the full impact of the piece. Adjacent to the three "Phrenitiscopes" is "The Amazing Madame Xan," a takeoff on a fortune-telling machine. To create this piece, Seiler placed a wigged mannequin head made up to look like a gypsy inside a glass case. Across the front of the case are wooden levers that, when pushed, reveal various fortunes, some of which are not too fortuitous. And speaking of unlucky, there's the "Wheel of More," a wheel of fortune with lots of bad things painted on it; when viewers spin it, they just might wind up having the pointer land on "Bankrupt" or even "You die."
Step Right Up! is extremely ambitious; it took some twenty assistants to pull off the "Circus of More." These artist-collaborators, who contributed not only elbow grease, but also some conceptual elements, are part of the Seiler-organized cooperative Teeter Totter Production Group, which was put together specifically for this show.
With the amount of work that Seiler, the Perry Weissman 3 and Teeter Totter put into this effort, it's a shame it will all have to be packed away in a couple of weeks. However, there will be a way to preserve the experience: A CD-DVD with the soundtrack and selected images will be available at the closing reception, slated for Friday, November 4, at Studio Aiello, from 6 to 9 p.m.
Over at the Metro State Center for Visual Art, there are three sculptures that look like lost elements from David Seiler's "Circus of More" -- and they are. The pieces are part of Metro Effect: Metro State Alumni Exhibition, a showcase of more than two dozen artists who graduated from Metropolitan State College, which celebrates its fortieth anniversary this year. The juried exhibition comprises selections made by a panel that includes former CVA director Kathy Andrews and two art-faculty members, Greg Watts and Yuko Yagisawa.
The fact that the show was juried instead of being an invitational -- and, worse yet, juried by a committee -- is doubtless why it's all over the map. Despite the many fine things in it, the exhibition does not hold together and is pretty incoherent. Then again, the topic -- people who graduated from Metro -- is inevitably wide-ranging. The sample from which participants in the show were culled was presumably huge, as the college has been chugging along for four decades and the art department has become enormous in the past twenty years. Currently, there are over 800 art majors there.
One thing that struck me was the near total lack of ceramics. Oh, sure, there are a few examples, but nothing near what I expected, considering that the late, great Rodger Lang taught ceramics there for so many years.
Among the Metro alums tapped for the show are a number who, like Seiler, have been fixtures on the Denver art scene -- none more so than Phil Bender, the director of Pirate and the city's oldest living conceptualist. Bender has a whole gallery to himself, which he's filled with a grid of buckets in the center surrounded by a wall of shovels, one of brooms and another of ladders. It's classic Bender in style -- and one of the best things in the exhibit.
Another longtime art-scene habitué is Carlos Frésquez, who not only attended Metro as a student, but teaches there today. For Metro Effect, Frésquez created a site-specific altar -- which also qualifies as an early entry for the Day of the Dead season later this month. Then there are Mark Friday's great interactive wall pieces -- "Single Wheel Turn," "Three Wheel Turn" and "Corner Situations" -- in which levers and knobs allow viewers to change the elements of the abstract compositions. And Lauri Lynnxe Murphy's "Pimpalicious," an overcoat made of stuffed animals, is a tour de force.
Other works worth noting are those by Christine Gabrielle Graziano, Bill Starke, Marie Morrison Quinn, Natascha Seideneck, Marsha Wooley and Shaun Acton.
I'd be lying if I said that Metro Effect was a great show, or that it truly represents the big contribution that Metro has made to contemporary art in Denver. It would be true, though, to say that it's worth seeing anyway.

The 64th Corps Support Group of the 13th Corps Support Command underwent a change of responsibility during a ceremony held on the 13th COSCOM guidon field here July 19.
The outgoing command sergeant major is Command Sgt. Maj. Donald L. Harris, bronze star recipient with nearly 30 years of Army service.
Incoming is Command Sgt. Maj. Michael L. Patterson, who holds the bronze star with one oak leaf cluster and has more than 20 years of Army service.
Patterson is no stranger to leadership or the COSCOM. Most recently, he served as command sergeant major for the COSCOM's Special Troops Battalion.
Another leadership position Patterson has filled is first sergeant of the 536th Maintenance Company.
A native of Cumberland, Va., Patterson entered the Army in September of 1982 and attended Basic Combat Training at Fort Jackson, S.C. He completed his initial entry training with Advanced Individual Training at Aberdeen Proving Grounds, Md.
Patterson holds an associate's degree in applied science from Austin Peay State University and a bachelor's degree in liberal arts from Parks University.

CleanStream® Provides Smart Alternatives To Move Waste Out Of Hospitals
Focus on Problem Solving Provides Innovative Solutions to Reduce Labor Costs and Stabilize Long-Term Waste Management Budgets for New and Existing Hospitals
(PRWEB) - CleanStream Systems, designed and engineered by MEMIOS Environmental Technologies (Greensboro, NC), impressed hospital management attendees at the recent American Society for Healthcare Engineering (ASHE) Annual Conference & Technical Exhibition in Chicago, Il. CleanStream combines advanced mechanical and air moving technologies to automate the repetitive, laborious, and inefficient tasks of safely moving large volumes of soiled linen and waste out of hospitals.
The cost of labor may represent as much as 60% of a hospital’s operating budget so it makes sense to evaluate potential areas where labor resources are most intensive. One obvious, but oftentimes overlooked example, is the utilization of carts, elevators, and gravity chutes to transport soiled linen, trash, and recyclables from their disposal point to a central collection location. Most hospitals assume this time-consuming process as their only alternative, but CleanStream offers innovative transport methods to automate the cycle and thereby reduce costly inefficiencies by as much as 10 times. One prominent Florida hospital recently automated their linen cart filling process and reduced human interventions by 80%. CleanStream Systems are ideally suited for new construction, but also offer solutions for existing facilities that use carts and gravity chutes for collection and transport.
“Hospitals manage a complexity of challenges and should not be burdened with everyday mundane tasks that detract from focusing on their core competencies,” remarked Jeff Shell, Vice President of Business Development. “We recognize that each hospital is different, so MEMIOS developed CleanStream to represent a customized system designed to address individual financial challenges and waste removal needs for each client.”
CleanStream Automation Systems promote healthier environments through cleaner and safer waste containment practices. Repurposing manual processes will also decrease human exposure to potential health risks and minimize liability exposure. Results are realized through greater financial flexibility along with increased patient and staff satisfaction.

Details are shaping up of a plan for a new government-backed high capacity data cable between Germany and Finland. The data transmission cable is aimed at making Finland one of the world's most attractive ICT regions.
The project to significantly upgrade Finland’s international data transfer capacity has long been high on the government's list of priorities as a means to entice more companies to base international data centres in Finland. More generally,.
Governia, a state-owned company, has acquired Corenet Oy which will act as the data cable management company. Coronet owns a 7,100-kilometre long network of fibre optic cables in Finland.
The project could be implemented in 2015, according to Haavisto.
According to current plans, the undersea optic fibre cable would run directly from Germany to Finland. Haavisto said that the project could make Finland a significant international data hub. So far, all data transmission to Finland has taken place via the Öresund Bridge, that is through Denmark and Sweden.Personalized Single Initial Monogram Necklace

Return to Local Conditions & Forecast
Area forecast discussion
National Weather Service Phoenix Arizona
323 am MST Friday may 22 2015
Synopsis...
a fairly strong upper level low will affect the region today into
early Saturday bringing cooler temperatures...and breezy to locally
windy conditions for today. Chances for showers and thunderstorms
today will be confined to mainly higher terrain areas from southeast
California northeastward into central and northern Arizona. Dry
conditions and a warming trend will then take over through next week
with temperatures climbing to around seasonal normals by the middle
of next week.
&&
Discussion...
today and Saturday will see the main upper level low swing through
Arizona into the central rockies with the majority of our County Warning Area
staying dry...but with continued breezy to windy conditions. Current
satellite imagery shows the low center right over Los Angeles with
middle and upper level moisture wrapping around mainly on the northern
periphery of the low. A 110 knots upper jet maximum rounding the base of the
trough will lift northeastward today with a pronounced dry slot
moving through southwest Arizona by 18z and into northeast Arizona by
00z Saturday. Strong southwesterly low level flow this morning will
allow for a narrow band of modest boundary layer moisture to move
into Arizona ahead of a diffuse frontal boundary. Best
chances...albeit still only a slight chance...for any showers and
maybe a few thunderstorms will from late morning into the afternoon
from jtnp eastward through northern Maricopa County as a strong pv
anomaly lifts northeastward through the area.
The low center will reach into the central rockies Saturday with
increasingly subsident northwest flow aloft taking over across our
region. The large scale trough will however still remain spread over
the Desert Southwest keeping relatively cool air in place. Highs
Saturday will improve over Friday/S middle 70s to lower 80s...but
only by a couple degrees. A compact shortwave trough is then shown to
quickly move through southern Arizona from the northwest later Sunday
into Sunday night...but with little to no moisture to work
with...only single digits probability of precipitation are in the forecast. Temperatures
will start to get a boost Sunday into Monday...but we will still be
several degrees shy of normal.
Next week looks to be more on the quiet side with no significant
weather systems on the horizon. Quasi-zonal westerly flow with
gradually increasing upper heights will allow high temperatures to
reach near normals by the middle of next week...and possibly nearing
100 degrees in a few Lower Desert spots for next Friday.
&&
Aviation... south-central Arizona including kphx...kiwa...and
ksdl...
Gusty west winds have tapered off following sunset...and should
start to back ahead of the approaching trough...turning to the
southeast by around 09z. They will veer again towards the
south/southwest by late morning Friday and become west again in the
afternoon with a few gusts over 18kt possible. Otherwise...the
mostly clear skies will give way to scattered low/middle cloud decks by
12z with bases mostly at or above 7k feet but there may be a few ceilings
developing during the day down to 5-6k feet as the main upper low
tracks by to our north. No precipitation is expected at any taf site next
24 hours...although there may be a stray shower or even a
thunderstorm along the far northern fringes of the greater Phoenix
area during the afternoon/early evening tomorrow.
Southeast California and southwest Arizona including kipl and kblh...
strong surface winds will be the main aviation concern through Friday
morning. Westerly gusts will persist until around midnight before
gradually weakening. Kblh will experience S/SW gusts not nearly as
strong...but also prevailing into the overnight hours. Occasional
middle/high level ceilings will be present...however should pose no impact.
Continued breezy conditions at kipl through the day on Friday.
No precipitation expected at any taf site through Friday evening.
Aviation discussion not updated for amended tafs.
&&
Fire weather...
Sunday through Thursday...
several weak weather disturbances will move through the district
next week...however dry weather will still prevail. A gradual
warming trend will also Grace the region bringing temperatures
closer to the seasonal normal. However...winds will generally remain
light following typical daily patterns leading to minimal fire
weather concerns.
&&
Psr watches/warnings/advisories...
Arizona...none.
California...none.

Our car had left at midday, and we arrived in Lamalera in the mid-afternoon. The accomodation in Lamalera is limited to a couple of homestays, and we checked into one of them - the home of Abel Beding and his family
So on Saturday morning at 7am we accompanied the crew of the boat 'Arnol'. Like roughly half of the 40 or so fishing boats owned by the clans of the village Arnol is a hand-built wooden boat with an outboard engine, and is used for hunting dolphins as well as manta ray and other large fish. The balance of the village fleet are outrigger 'pledang' boats propelled by traditional palm-frond sails instead of engines. These are used for whale hunting.
The international whaling treaty exempts the people of Lamalera from the ban on whale hunting, on the grounds that this is a unique and traditional way of life. They are thus permitted to use only their sail boats for whale hunting, and land around 15 to 20 sperm whales a year
Visiting Lamalera and accompanying a fishing boat presented a moral challenge to us: of course, we instinctively find the idea of whale and dolphin hunting offensive; yet, staying in the village, meeting the people and seeing how they live, we quickly realised that they were barely eking out a living from this subsistence way of life. As Westeners who live in comfort, consuming huge amounts of natural resources yet staying well removed from our food sources, it would be wrong of us to judge this way of life by our own standards.
Though we were eager to observe the unique hunting methods of Lamalerans, we were secretly hoping that no whales would make an appearance - the thought of a full blown whale hunt was just a little too daunting. Thankfully, no whales had been spotted that morning and the prahus remained firmly ashore; Arnol's crew were on the lookout for dolphins
The technique for hunting dolphins is the same as for whales - the harpooner, youngest and fittest of the crew, stands on a small platform on the bow of the boat, weilding a long bamboo shaft with a barbed metal harpoon tip. When the boat comes within striking distance of an animal, he lunges at it, flinging himself into the water to put his full weight behind the harpoon. More often than not it's a miss; a line is thrown to the harpooner and he scrambles on board looking exhausted. If it's a hit, a second and third harpoon are often needed to secure the animal. Then the long battle to reel it in begins... hit or no hit, the whole process is a labour intensive group effort, requiring each of the eight or so crew members to do their bit at just the right second.
We found the sight of struggling dolphins rather hard to bear, yet the absolute delight and relief of the crew whenever they landed their catch made one realise how much they needed it. At about 2pm, with five dolphins in the boat, the guys called it a day, and we started chugging back to shore. By now the two of us were starving, thirsty, sun-burned and quite traumatised. But instead of coming ashore an hour or so later, it took us another four hours to getb back... the boat engine packed up! The helmsman would really battle to start it (Rich was often asked to pull the chord, as he had an unusually high success rate!), then it would splutter a little and die again. Finally, just before sunset, another boat came out looking for us and towed us back. Phew, what a day! We watched as the old men of the village butchered the dolphins on the beach, sharing out the meat to women from various households.
The following day, Sunday morning, most of the 2,000 or so inhabitants of the village went to church (like Flores, the island is staunchly Catholic) - from the verandah of Abel's place we watched families troop by in their Sunday best: clean sarongs, colourful blouses, the women's long black hair knotted tightly in a high bun. We went for a walk to the west of the village and found a secluded little cove where the snorkeling was excellent. The water was crystal clear and the soft corals covering the dark volcanic rocks seemed more like cold water forms. However, walking back up the hill we discovered that a whole clan of youngsters had been spying on us! They said a shy hello and scattered as we walked up the path. Good thing we hadn't been skinny dipping! After another superb lunch at the homestay, we walked the road along the coast in the opposite direction, and found another beautiful little beach.
On Monday morning, Rich joined the fishermen again while I relaxed, chatted to a few people in the village and went back to the little beach we had discovered the afternoon before. The snorkeling from here was absolutely gorgeous too, but I had to keep a look-out for little spies! In the early afternoon, before the boat came in, I returned to the village beach and sat in the shade of one of the boat sheds with a young man named Thomy. Thomy was teaching himself English and eagerly paged through the Rough Guide, trying to read bits here and there. He was particularly taken with the Glossary section, and we had an amusing English-Indonesian conversation using the glossary as a dictionary. By the end of the afternoon, Rich and I had promised to post him a proper dictionary (which we duly did from Bali when we returned there). No doubt the little book will be passed around and use by all the others like him in the village - bright kids who simply do not have educational opportunities available to them.
That evening we said goodbye to all the friends we had made in Lamalera. We'd been bowled over by the friendliness of the villagers and their decency and inner strength despite the hand-to-mouth existence many of them faced. At 5am the next morning, we boarded a 4WD truck back to Lewoleba, from where we returned to Flores by ferry.

Testament -- Hollywood, CA -- June 11th, 2009
I got there at 4.30, waited in line for 2 and a half hours and easily got a spot on the barrier. Shook hands with Chuck Billy and Greg Christian too as they were just walking by the line!!
Lazarus A.D
opened the show at around 7.30 and they played for about half an hour. They played some really good thrash I thought. But they said they are from Wisconsin, thats why it wasn't as good as bay area thrash .
Most of their songs sounded similar to each other, but I guess thats how bands like these sounds when you listen to them for the first time.
Unearth
were next and they played for a whole fuckin hour. Man I hated that shit so much that I can't even find words to express it. And one of their guitarists who was on my side of the stage kept spitting on us after every song. He was also spitting and then catching it himself. I have no idea who told him that THAT would look cool on stage.
And the singer kept coming near us and head banging which threw up sweat all over us. That stupid guitarist also stepped on my friend's elbow twice, when he was trying to dive into the crowd. By the end of their show I was bathed in spit and sweat. Anyway, enough of them already.
Testament
hit the stage at 10 o clock and opened with The Preacher. We went nuts. I mean totally nuts!!! This was my first time seeing Testament too. I have no complaints whatsoever with the setlist. People can bitch all they want, I don't give two fucks. It was my first time, and I loved each and every minute of it!! Eric Peterson was in front of me the whole time and I was touching distance from his guitar. Chuck and Alex too kept coming to our side and got us even more pumped. Souls of Black was the highlight for me as its my favorite Testament song (Odd choice I know, but yeah). Chuck asked the crowd to do the 'wall of death' thing during the last song Formation of Damnation and I turned back and looked at the place go fuckin insane! It was great to watch!!
After that I got hand shakes from each member and then Eric, Alex and Chuck handed me autographed picks!!! Yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!
I hung around for another 10 minutes and finally got hold of the setlist too!!!
I told a friend earlier today that I'm going to see Testament. He said 'I heard they are not that good live'. Whoever told him that, I wanna kill that person because Testament ripped the place apart!!!! Yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!! What a great night!!!
Setlist :
1. The Preacher
2. The New Order
3. Over The Wall
4. Practice What You Preach
5. More Than Meets The Eye
6. The Persecuted Won't Forget
7. Burnt Offerings
8. The Haunting
9. The Legacy
10.Into The Pit
11.Souls Of Black
12.Electric Crown
13.Disciples Of The Watch
Encore:
14.D.N.R
15.3 Days In Darkness
16.The Formation Of Damnation

The Bill requires the New Zealand Superannuation Fund to consider climate change and the broader environmental impact of the companies in which they invest.
"The super fund is about long-term economic thinking. My bill will ensure environmental considerations are an integral part of that thinking," said Green Party Co-leader Dr Russel Norman.
"The New Zealand Superannuation Fund recently divested from some companies due to environmental and human rights considerations, so it can be done.
"This is a smart way to run our superannuation fund. Investing in companies that are working to mitigate climate change means our money will be invested today in the new clean economy of tomorrow."
Dr Norman also pointed out it is possible for the super fund to be both responsible and profitable.
"The world's largest sovereign wealth fund, the Norwegian Pension fund, has world-leading responsible investment criteria overseen by an ethics council," said Dr Norman.
"Their criteria prohibits investment in companies that cause severe environmental degradation.
"My bill will align our fund's responsible investment decision making processes with global best practice. It is a clear change to the Act that will have positive consequences for the environment."16 For the Lord aHimself bwill descend from heaven with a 1cshout, with the voice of dthe archangel and with the etrumpet of God, and fthe dead in Christ will rise first.
17 Then awe who are alive 1and remain will be bcaught up together with them cin the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we shall always dbe with the Lord.
18 Therefore comfort one another with these words.!Yet another Hollywood marriage bites the dust. We begin wonder if there is any hope for us non-celebrities in love? After all, on paper, Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes, seemed to have the fairytale marriage: he a successful heart throb, her the quintessential innocent princess. They both seemed to be so in love and so rich!
It came as no surprise that this marriage ended badly. Tom Cruise obviously chose Katie Holmes, but did Katie really choose him? While she was enthralled with being swept off her feet by an attentive and loving Tom, she was not on board with what was to come next.
It would appear that Tom Cruise chose Katie Holmes in the hope that she would be willing to accept his lifestyle, no questions asked. Maybe he felt that Katie was young and impressionable enough to accept life on his terms. Although Tom managed to work his magic for longer than expected, the glass house soon came crashing down.
While it is very hard not to like Tom Cruise and to admire his achievements, it is difficult to understand his choices especially when it comes to his religion: Scientology. In a world of free choices and free will, it really should not matter what religion Tom Cruise chooses to practise. However, it becomes a deal breaker when your wife is not on board. Tom is not the only person to have to face this dilemma, I have a friend who married a Muslim man and only when their first ,child was born, did he begin to enforce the need for both his wife and child to convert to Islam. As a devoted wife, my friend converted but she secretly confessed to me that if she had known about this before, she probably would never have married him. Three years later and like Katie Holmes, she too is planning her escape.
So what can we learn from this divorce and marriage? There are a couple of obvious points.
Firstly, always discuss life plans with a potential partner before walking down the aisle.
Religion, kids, animals, family are all key issues which must be discussed openly and honestly. If you desperately want to have kids and the other person is not interested in having kids, that is a deal breaker, don't assume you can change their minds.
Secondly, never go into a marriage trying to change or tweak the other person.
If you cannot accept them as they are, then walk away before you end up like Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes. I think, Tom hoped that Katie would just accept her new life, and that he could tweak little inconsistencies in her behaviour. For instance, he maintained a distance from Katie's family. Many times people who want to control the behaviour of others will actively cut them off from their support group. It is easier to influence someone who has no one to question their decisions.
Thirdly, take care not to lose yourself in the relationship.
If you become attached at the hip and you lose who you are, if the marriage ends, you will find that you feel empty and hopeless. It is always a good idea to be able to be self-sufficient even though you are in a relationship. Katie, may not have this issue as she is well off. However, in normal terms, some women remain with abusive men simply because they cannot fend for themselves and their children. There are a lot of wealthy men who hold executive positions in companies and are completely controlling of their wives. I worked for a battered women's clinic and I had to opportunity to see this first hand. It is disheartening to know that a woman stays to give her children the life they deserve while she is treated as a mere punching bag.
Fourthly, always remember that when dating the person is putting on their best behaviour.
If you spot inconsistencies or issues in this dating period, deal with them realistically. Think to yourself that if this is their best behaviour and I have issue with it now, what happens when we are married and two to three years in, can I really put up with these traits? Sometimes it is hard to walk away, but you may just be saving your life in doing so.
I always feel sad when people get divorced, especially when children are involved. However, divorce is a personal decision and if that person believes that it is the best option for them and their loved ones, then all we can do is to support them. From the outside you can have all sorts of opinions, but unless you are a fly on the wall, and with that family day in day out, I really think that you should be kind to them and withhold judgement. Sometimes the person may be too embarrassed to tell you exactly why they left.
To be a good friend and listener is to just be there and to offer no solutions, the person comes to what's best for them in their own time.

I'm sorry to hear about your dad needing surgery! Glad to hear he's on the mend, though that kind of operation does take a while to recover from. Hope your back gets back to normal soon.
May can be so terribly busy with school stuff. And baseball, too - wow! My hat's off to you!Morty Yalovsky, BSc’65, MSc’68, PhD’77, first joined McGill as a professor in the Faculty of Management in 1974.

First, viewers will be treated to the series finale of Spartacus: War of the Damned, which is immediately followed by Da Vinci’s Demons, a new drama Starz probably hopes not only takes over its timeslot, but a bulk of the same viewers.
And while the series does feature its share of violence and sexual situations, fans should expect a different tone for the show, as we learn what the 25-year old Leonardo Da Vinci was like while living in 15th century Florence and rubbing elbows with the powerful and elite.
During my time last week in Florence for the world premiere of the ambitious series, star Tom Riley, who plays Da Vinci, and creator David S. Goyer each laid out how the series came together for its eight-episode run on Starz. Here’s the breakdown:
The Casting Of Da Vinci: Goyer explained that he was a bit nervous since they hadn’t found the right actor for the titular role…until Tom Riley auditioned, as the producer says he did an "incredible job."
The producers didn’t need a familiar name actor for the role, according to Goyer: “I felt that Leonardo, he was the big name so we didn’t necessarily need a big name, and, at least in America, no one knew who any of those actors [that] were in Game of Thrones. No one, even Sean Bean. No one in America knew who any of those people were and it didn’t make any difference.”
How To Play The Greatest Mind In History: Once he nabbed the role, how tough was it for Riley to get inside Da Vinci’s mind? “The thing is,” Riley explained, “you have to find those elements that are similar. Far be it from me to think that I have any of that intellect or that imagination or that incredible thirst for knowledge but I try to find the similarities in the smaller things, in his perfectionism, in his self-criticism and his self-loathing…those are very human qualities.”
Complicated Romance: As played by Laura Haddock, Lucrezia becomes the puzzle that the genius that is Da Vinci cannot decipher. “He meets her and, as we find out, there is something about her that he can’t put a finger on,” Riley said. “There is something shadowy. For a man who is absolutely fascinated by solving things and making sense of puzzles, she is the ultimate puzzle that he can’t unlock.”
He added with a grin: “Also, she’s a means to an end in that first episode. So, at the beginning they’re certainly using one another.” Watch for Lucrezia to be just as complicated as everyone else in the series.
Gay? Bi? What’s Da Vinci’s Deal? It’s not lost on Goyer that the controversy over Da Vinci’s sexuality mirrors our current gay marriage issues: "We’ve got a big case in the Supreme Court right now about whether or not homosexuals can be married. We were aware of that as we were doing some of the episodes in our season, which is not to say this is our gay episode, but we were aware of what was happening now, and also aware of what was happening in the 15th century.”
Goyer, never afraid of stirring people up with his work, said of the episodes dealing with Da Vinci’s sexuality: “I think we’ll have some people very happy and some people very angry, and that makes me happy. We wouldn’t be doing our job if that wasn’t happening.”
Tom Riley, Method Actor: Riley did a lot of the art work in the show as well as sword work. But he had an added obstacle to overcome: “Because [Da Vinci] was ambidextrous. I did a lot of work with my left hand. I spent a lot of time trying to make myself as dexterous with my left hand as I could. They wouldn’t let me near a sword until I was good enough with my left hand that I wasn’t going to kill someone.”
And, yes, that is Riley’s own sketching in the first episode of the series. “The scene where I’m sketching Laura across the market,” he explained, “the art department gave me various stages. Stage one of that drawing, stage three, stage six and I would learn the in-between. So, I’d do the stage two for myself with both hands and then we would try and shoot me doing it with my left hand…it took months.”
Faith vs. Science: “I’m alarmed at so much of the world today seems to be anti-science and anti-rationalist,” Goyer said, “and that will be one of the things we’ll be exploring constantly in this show is this friction between faith and rationalism.”
He added, in regards to Da Vinci himself, “not only did he question faith but he questioned other people’s scientific accounts, so personally I tend to side more on the side of empiricism and rationalism, but I’m also not just making this show for me. So the show is also about that debate, I guess. “
Da Vinci’s Demons premieres tonight at 10 p.m. after the series finale of Spartacus: War of the Damned at 9 p.m. on Starz.
While I appreciate David Goyer's decision to cast an unknown (in America) actor to play Leonardo DaVinci, I do not appreciate his comment that no one from "Game of Thrones" was known in the U.S., not even Sean Bean. Sean has been a known actor in the U.S. for many years. I first knew of him from "Patriot Games"(1992), "Goldeneye"(1995), and, of course, as Boromir in the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy (2001-3). I was also familiar with Mark Addy, from such work as "The Flintstones:Viva Rock Vegas" and "The Full Monty". Would I have watched "Game of Thrones" without knowing who Sean Bean and Mark Addy were first? Possibly. However, Sean Bean was one of the primary reasons I tuned in to start with and, while I do still tune in after his character has been killed off, it was Sean's presence in the cast that got me interested in watching in the first place. That doesn't mean I have to have heard of someone in order to watch a program, but, in the case of "Game of Thrones," it certainly did help.Ethicist says violence a moral option
In a broken world, Christians sometimes may need to use force — even deadly force — to protect the innocent, but they always should recognize their actions fall short of God’s ideal, a Christian ethicist told students at Baylor University’s Truett Theological Seminary.
By Ken Camp
The use of deadly force can be justified in a broken world inhabited by “moral monsters,” Baptist ethicist Roger Olson told students at Baylor University’s George W. Truett Theological Seminary Nov. 6.
“The kingdom of God is not yet, and, in the meantime, this time between the times, it is our duty as citizens of that kingdom yet to come to approximate it in real and living ways,” said Olson, the Foy Valentine professor of Christian theology and ethics at Truett Seminary. “Sometimes that means using the powerful means we have.”
He cautioned, however, that Christians should always regard force as a sign of the world’s brokenness and avoid “baptizing it as righteous.”
“Contrary to certain modern and contemporary Christian ethicists who say an absolute ‘no’ to all Christian use of force, I must reluctantly say, with (Reformer Martin) Luther, ‘Sin boldly’ — but add, ‘Repent more boldly still,’” Olson said.
Olson framed the T.B. Maston Foundation lecture, honoring the pioneering professor of Christian ethics who taught four decades at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary, in the context of Machine Gun Preacher.
The controversial 2011 movie told the true story of Sam Childers, a Christian missionary who used violence to resist the so-called Lord’s Resistance Army in the Sudan and its enlistment of child soldiers.
“Is Christian involvement in social unrest, social struggle, the often messy rough-and-tumble of politics, even violence ever ethically justifiable?” Olson asked. ?”
Olson outlined four Christian responses to those questions, highlighting strengths and weaknesses of each approach:
• The Social Gospel, exemplified by early 20th century Baptist pastor-theologian Walter Rauschenbusch, teaches the value of voluntary brotherhood achieved through moral persuasion — even pressure — but not violence.
• Christian Realism, taught by influential theologian Reinhold Niebuhr, views the world as broken and unjust. Niebuhr urged Christians to make the best of the sinful and imperfect situation by working to bring about imperfect approximations of justice, even if that means some degree of compromise with the ungodly.
• Liberation Theology, promoted by Latin American theologian Gustavo Gutierrez, teaches that Christian love requires solidarity with the poor and powerless, and justice happens when the poor are empowered.
• Christian pacifism, taught by John Howard Yoder and Stanley Hauerwas, insists Jesus did not come into the world to overthrow unjust systems but to establish an alternative social order within the broken world following principles in the Sermon on the Mount.”
Olson agreed with pacifists that Christians should help the church be the witness of peace to the world, avoiding all entanglements of the church with the state.
“The church is not called to be a launching pad for revolutionaries but a community of love,” he said. “The church should never take up arms for any cause.”
At the same time, Olson said, individual Christians “must be open to the call of God to take up power — even deadly force, if necessary — to defend the weak, the helpless and the oppressed.”
While Machine Gun Preacher was a box-office flop, in October Childers received the Mother Teresa Memorial International Award for Social Justice, in recognition of his efforts to rescue children in troubled areas.

Please review our comments policy here.As part of a month long celebration of all things scary, SE&L will use its regular Monday/Thursday commentary pieces as a platform to discuss a few of horror’s most influential and important filmmakers. This time around, George A. Romero’s redefinition of the zombie movie.
He didn’t invent the zombie movie, but his entries in the genre have clearly defined and mythologized it. Some would even say that he is the only undead auteur that understands the cinematic category. As important to horror as any filmmaker before or since, advertising executive turned director George Romero single-handled lifted the living dead film from its voodoo roots and reconfigured it as a stunning social comment on the shifting state of America. From 1968 until now, the Pittsburgh icon has forged a unique career, mixing styles and subject matter to touch on almost every aspect of the macabre. He’s taken on vampirism (Martin), madness (The Crazies) - even a tribute to one of the founding facets of post-modern horror, EC Comics (Creepshow).
Yet it’s his regular return to the flesh eater film that remains a constant in the mind of his followers. Such substantive acclaim – all four Dead films have met with varying degrees of adoration – makes Romero that rarity in the realm of the reanimated human. Naturally, this begs the question, what is it about his approach to the cannibal corpse that makes it so powerful, and why can’t others match his legitimate legacy as a formidable fright filmmaker? It’s a quandary that has sparked hundreds of overheated debates.
It was clear from his first installment of what is now a quartet of quintessential efforts that Romero wasn’t using the classic concept of horror to formulate the fear in Night of the Living Dead. Classic terror, usually defined around the Universal ideal of Gothic monster movies made during the ‘30s and ‘40s, argued against a clear reality as the backdrop to fear. Instead, everything was hyperstylized, from the setting and situations to the players taking part in the terror. From Romero’s point of view, the growing aesthetic advances made during the ‘50s and ‘60s, from the medium mutating French New Wave to the cinema vérité documentaries sweeping the circuit, allowed the introduction of truth and authenticity into motion picture macabre.
Night‘s story was deceptively simple. A brother and sister, visiting a relatives grave, are attacked by what appears to be a madman. It soon turns out that the dead have come back to life, and are killing and consuming the living. Finding a seemingly abandoned farmhouse to hide in, Barbara soon meets up with Ben, a fellow refugee that just so happens to be black. As they try to secure their position, they discover a family in the basement, along with a teenage couple. All are hiding and less than excited about helping. Soon, everyone is working together to battle the growing menace outside. News reports witnessed over the television indicate a situation slowly winding out of control. Even though the reports seem positive, there’s a growing sense that all is lost. All these people can do is hope for the best, and fight to survive.
With this one monochrome masterwork, Romero reconfigured the elements of fright, using recognizable individual types and understandable circumstances to elevate his shocking supernatural splatter. Night invested the scary movie with a new sense of immediacy, its narrative almost unrelenting in the way it paces its zombie attacks. Just enough time passes for the television to deliver another set of sinister warnings before the next deluge of the dead occurs. This then gave the terror that much more relevancy to an audience used to the hustle and bustle of life. The situation therefore didn’t require such a massive suspension of disbelief.
All pointed political grousing aside (each one of his films have a sound social stance at their center), the real advance Romero championed was indeed to connect horror to the everyday life of the audience. Few were familiar with haunted castles, grave robbing, and blood drinking Counts. But show them a mob of viscous, mindless killers pounding at the door, looking for flesh to consume, and suddenly the security of existence seems a little shaky. Toss in a touch of racism, matricide, and a lot of unanswered questions about human foibles and frailties, and you have a major shift in the fright film language.
It continued on a decade later with Romero’s return to the series, 1978’s Dawn of the Dead. Now capable of tapping into elements unavailable to him at the time of Night‘s creation (color film, advanced F/X and make-up work) and using a far more recognizable space as his frame of everyday reference – the shopping mall – this filmmaker fashioned his new slaughter spectacle as an apocalyptic look at the disintegration of infrastructure and the completely plausible ‘us vs. them’ mentality that arrives whenever an unfathomable act of evil confronts our sensibilities. In this case, a group of professionals (two TV reporters, two government soldiers) hole up in a local shopping center, clearing out the zombies and protecting themselves from the monstrous mob outside to try and recreate their once semi-privileged lives.
All throughout the course of the film’s opening act, we see the foursome battle to reach their consumer sanctuary, fending off all manner of undead obstacles. Once safely inside, they begin to plot. Zombies are destroyed, doors blocked off. A perfect asylum from the atrocities around them allows the group to gorge on the many materialistic pleasures available. We see our heroes hording food, glutting themselves on fancy meals and overindulging in items of extravagance. By the time some like-minded outsiders arrive – in the guise of marauding bikers – our clique has become covetous of their self-made retreat. By contrasting the death of one social structure with the attempted birth of another, Romero made all his points about class and equality. But buried in the heart of the political science was really just an examination of the human desire for comfort and security.
In many ways, Dawn represented the end of the reality-based Romero horror film. His next two efforts in the Dead series would remove most of the recognizable pragmatic aspects of the situation (real world places, interpersonal human interaction) with outrageous scenarios and even odder zombie circumstances. As a result, the director continued to polish his approach, picking and choosing the aspects he really wanted to explore. His follow up, 1986’s Day of the Dead - considered by many to be the lesser of all four films (it’s a highly debatable delineation) - argues from the beginning that the real world is long dead. In a stellar opening setpiece, a lone band of governmental scientists and soldiers try to drum up anything “living” in what appears to be an abandoned town. The minute their presence is known, however, hordes of ravenous zombies begin literally crawling out of the woodwork. As the streets fill with thousands of flesh craving fiends, we see the end of human civilization, reconfigured in the stammering, shuffling walk of a reanimated corpse.
This doesn’t mean that Romero totally avoids reality in this glorious cinematic gross out. Instead of focusing on the social, or the political, the director focuses his attention on personality. We see the simmering divides between people, the hatred the military has for the scientists and visa versa. Both are forced to live and interact with each other, but with their individual purposes being crossed and contradictory, they can literally never see eye to eye on anything. This means the real horror is personal, not apocalyptic. As the world decays outside, humanity’s lost hope are arguing in a bunker over sexual favors, the rounding up of additional zombies for experimentation, and what they will do should the need arise to escape from their underground bunker.
This makes Day a very dark film indeed, the kind of exploration of the fragile human soul that many don’t imagine they’ll ever want to witness. Unrelenting in its horror, featuring the perfect contextual juxtaposition of Tom Savini’s ultra realistic autopsy like effects, it remains a movie arguing that the only way to recapture the purity of existence is a kind of total rejection of the past. Toward the end, when things are going decidedly deranged, the Jamaican helicopter pilot argues for everyone to simply drop their duty and fly off to a deserted island somewhere. There, some manner of life can be restarted, one without the constant threat of the living dead causing chaos and the amplification of human faults. The idea is not so much rejected as reconfigured by many of the things we see later. When a “trained” zombie named Bub proves that he can respond with thought, no matter how simplistic, ‘it’ dooms everything around it. The notion that these “things” can actually reason refutes the feeling that they’re just obstacles to overcome. Instead, they become opponents in a battle for the rest of the planet.
With such a solid third installment, it’s odd then that it took 20 years for Romero to revisit his zombie mythos. He has been quoted as saying that the failure to fully realize his ideas for Day of the Dead (his original script featured zombie armies, trained by the government, waging all out war against their fellow flesheaters in massive battle scenes) plus the rather uninteresting political landscape left him lost for a way back into his series. Oddly enough, when Land of the Dead finally arrived, it was amazingly well received. Considered a return to form and a furthering of his agenda-based fright facets, the truth is far more complex. In essence, Land is a distillation of all three previous Dead films. It offers Night‘s home as hospice, Dawn‘s man-made oasis, and Day‘s military inspired sense of security. It also illustrates the corruptibility of all three, how each one is a fool’s paradise built on bricks and the backs of those dumb enough to try and fend for themselves.
In Land, years have passed, and zombies now live in quasi-communal packs, easily preyed upon by scavengers looking for goods to barter with in the new quarantined city of Fiddler’s Green. This sectioned off society has a typical structure – fat cats at the top, middle class barely making ends meet, underclass doing all the grunt work – and it reflects the way in which the living dead also organize themselves. When they finally decide to attack the humans, they place the lesser corpses up front, fodder for protecting the so-called “smarter” ones following up behind. The purpose is simple – confront the living on their own terms. The concept is clear – as a repressed majority, they will no longer sit by and let the Establishment minority ignore their existence.
Again, the political ramifications are intense. The zombie leader is a big, beefy black man who was obviously once a gas station attendant. Similarly, the humans capable of defending the Green are all members of the mitigated lower class. Together, they form a conspiratorial element that is destined to topple any arrogant hierarchy. But the main theme of Land of the Dead is the shredding and selling of hope. In a world which seems sorely lacking in any kind of recognizable trust, Romero reiterates that belief in something beyond oneself is only fated to fail. By using the individual instinct to survive, and marrying that with the intelligence to find an escape, the results are either prophetic or predetermined. Land ends on a note of vigilante vindication as well as a possibility of survival. It has de-evolved the genre into a simple screed on Darwin’s ‘only the completely capable endure’ ideal.
Romero will always be remembered for reinstating terror back into the horror movie mix. Where once outrageousness and the fear of the unknown seemed like reason enough to keep the macabre minions at bay, he amplified the angst by directly linking his dread to the things in life that people can instantly identify with. They say that the number one and two fears that most individuals have are their own death, and the death of a loved one. Romero rewired this trepidation into a meditation on mortality, an argument against an afterlife and an easily recognizable relationship between living humans and undead corpses. Keeping the connection physical – via eating – was the final major masterstroke. It gave his Dead films a visceral edge that most fright films just couldn’t compete with. It’s why these four films remain classics of the creature feature genre. It’s why George Romero’s legacy as a fright icon is already secured.Williams: An ugly road win?

I am feeling a lot better about this game today than i was last night. This was exactly the type of game that Iowa wins on a regular basis. How many times have they played just well enough to stay within one posession only to drive the field late in the 4th to steal the W. That is just what they do.
There is a lot of work to do, but I'm feeling good about being 2-0 right now.
Excellent work as usual, C-Dub.

I guess I'd have to respectfully disagree with you Chris. You say there's no such thing as an ugly road win, but then you go on to explain exactly just how "ugly" it was.
It was definately an ugly win, but yes we'll take it and be happy as can be about it. But... it was UGLY. Shouldn't have been ugly, but it was. You can't hide that fact.Details

Here is another instance of it:
'maintenance' layout has option 'nonavbar'=>true
but it is not respected in clean/layout/columns1.php
The following files need to be corrected:
clean/layout/columns1.php
clean/layout/columns2.php
clean/layout/columns3.php
bootstrapbase/layout/columns1.php
bootstrapbase/layout/columns2.php
bootstrapbase/layout/columns3.php
Other layouts do not display navigation bar at all so there is no problems there.
I attached the branch where I fix it quite primitive way. I would really like some Frontend people and especially Bootstrap guru to look at it and decide how to display html if navbar is not to be displayed
PS this also happens if you have 2.5 site, set theme to Clean and upgrade to 2.6
Note: I think a fix for this should be backported because its possible the 2.5 upgrade could lead to situations like this too.
I'm afraid it also displays navbar in quizzes where it is not supposed to be
Bootstrap GURU is there sure a person? LOL
Can someone check Moodle standard theme layouts as I am finding more and more that the layout options do not seem to be working as they should.
The navbar issus with Bootstrap themes is unfotunate as the there are two. The one at the top of the screen and the navbar/breadcrumb, which is the one that should not be there but is.
David knows more about the whys and wherefores of the layout better than I do. I tend to sit in the background and just fix the bugs as they present themselves. But I think the navbar naming is something else and needs fixing better than it is at present.
I see that David Scotson is also watching this. David can you give us your view on this please?
You know what, I'm marking it as a "could be security issue", we will discuss tomorrow whether to keep it so or not.
yes Mary, you are right. Clean/bootstrapbase also ignores nofooter, nocustommenu, nocourseheader/footer/headerfooter,
also it does not even define in config.php such options as noblocks, nologininfo and nologinlinks
This piece in core.less just killed me - all data is being hidden with CSS:
which means that everything is still present on the page! Except upgrade problems that occur when navigation bar is being rendered it also means that in quiz popup all this information is also present and little acquaintance with firebug makes it accessible to students. Also in maintenance mode students can access the page footer and if admin enabled some debuging/perfinfo display - it is there.
PS Dan, you were wondering why you did not see error messages on /admin/index.php and it was displayed blank for you. Here is the answer - it was inside the navbar block and therefore hidden with CSS
Hehe fun issue.
Just noting that quiz uses the secure pagelayout, and through bootstrapbase the secure layout file which does not contain any of this stuff.
I think it is safe to remove the security level here.
I introduced that CSS by the way, and as part of that commit removing all logic from those themes.
I think this case safely be considered a regression from those changes.
There are two solutions as I see it:
- Bring back the logic for the header/footer options.
- Switch the layout definition to use a more appropriate layout file and remove the options completely.
I know that no2 is easier for theme developers because there is less PHP code there. But it means more layout pages and more chances that we fix (later on) something in one of them and forget another.
Btw since bootstrapbase overwrites core_renderer anyway, do you think we can include verifying of the options in functions displaying the navbar and footer? Just to double check
I've bumped this up into next sprint for FRONTEND ... Sam can you look at this?
Obviously we need to reduce further regressions to other themes to a minimum. If this can not be zero, please make this super clear.
I imagine third party themes already have this problem (especially that popular one with the menu on the top). It seems to me the safest way is to make this upgrade process theme indepedent.
I've created a branch that properly implements the maintenance layout. This would be option #2 that I noted above and the bare minimum fix.
repo: git://github.com/samhemelryk/moodle.git
branch: 41398-26
diff:
This fixes the immediate issue at hand but doesn't do anything to prevent this same issue from arising for another theme should a developer carelessly introduce an API call not supported during upgrade.
As Dan mentioned the best way to prevent this would be to make upgrade theme independent. However I feel while that is the most thorough solution it is perhaps a little anti-progressive and over bearing as really we should be able to support themes during upgrade through better management.
One thought that occurs to me is to provide a "maintenance" version of the core renderer as $OUTPUT that invisibly disregards requests to OUTPUT methods that require API's not available during upgrade. After playing with this for half an hour there are more intricacies that I envisaged and I think the hopes of such a solution succeeding are fading. That said its late here and perhaps something will come to me overnight so I will present the above solution for the time being and continue to ponder renderers and preventing access to unavailable API's during upgrade.
Many thanks
Sam
that's a nice solution - it fixes all clones of Clean theme as well. Should not we suppress the footer as well in maintenance?
I remove my branch from the issue, it is not a good solution anyway. For reference it is here
There should be no homelink in footer but I think it would be wise to have the empty footer as you can see the debugging info there if need be.
I'd say this is the exact reason why footer should NOT be there - students/guests are not supposed to see debugging or other page information when site is in mainenance mode
+1 for separate maintenance page, there cannot be any links or system API calls that result in DB reads there. Ideally there should not be even any login or user profile link.
Since Mary mentioned my name earlier, I should point out that I didn't have anything to do with the layout rewrite, so I've not got much to contribute here. I like Sam's #2 fix idea though, seems cleanest.
Someone mentioned hard-coded themes (or being "theme independant") for upgrades, and I've previously suggested that some of the admin parts of Moodle could be simplified if they used a single theme (I'd suggest a variation on Clean), and this has various benefits e.g. you don't need to send that specialised admin CSS to every single student user of the site. The main thing stopping that is that, unlike say Wordpress, Moodle has no hard line between the functional "backstage" area and the branded user facing areas. But upgrade and install and probably a few other areas clearly qualify so you could probably do it in those clearly defined areas. (Install currently hard-codes some subset of CSS to use from Base and Standard I believe).
@David, I was meaning the CSS not the layouts.
@Marina, sorry I forgot other people (Guests and Users) can see the maintenance page too, I thought only I saw it.
Ok I've simplified the footer, removing the home and docs links.
The standard footer HTML is still set to be displayed there however I think that is acceptable as it has always been designed to work for these pages.
I've also managed to inject a maintenance renderer in place of the core_renderer which is used within theme layout files as $OUTPUT.
The maintenance renderer extends the core_renderer but calls to API methods that would cause issues when in "maintenance" mode will simply return empty strings without triggering the API's that would lead to the issues.
Accompanying this I've got a couple of unit tests although automatic testing is rather week here still as we don't currently test the theme output processes. Testing will need to be very thorough.
Presently I am still testing this myself, I've shared the code here now however so that others can check it out but please be aware it is still liable to change if I encounter any edge cases.
Also worth noting that discussion here is leading towards the idea of better separating this code.
I completely 100% agree, separation is long overdue, especially for admin/index.php which serves several purposes presently.
However such an task would definitely be better as a separate issue, and as it would be master only and I require a 25 fix for this undoable here.
I'll have a search and see if there is already an issue for this and if not, create one.
Many thanks

Considering that this is now critical as Clean theme breaks a new installation and also screws up an upgrade, I just cannot see why Clean theme needs extra treatment just to make it do what all the other themes do?
All I can think, at this moment in time, after spending a very long time last night trying to set up a new installation of Moodle 2.6 Dev on a laptop, and finding that Clean theme is now the center of a
MDL-41780 by not only breaking an upgrade but totally screwing up a new installation.
I just think Clean is getting more and more complex where there is really no need. It uses a simple layout, it uses simple logic, why create more renderers and then still block all the elements with CSS, this just sounds too crazy to me.
Code looks fine, just not 100% sure about all the "Computer says no..." comments though. Funny, but not really meaningful.
Sam, I've noticed that Clean theme overwrites all layouts from bootstrapbase and replaces the heading with the custom logo if it is specified in settings. This means that after your change the custom logo will not be displayed in Clean theme on maintenance page.
Please tell me if this is ok or you want to add a layout file for clean as well.
We could mention new layout file in theme/bootstrapbase/upgrade.txt (introduced in 2.6 afaik)
Also just to let you know that I will need to squash your commits anyway because they modify the same code
Hi Marina,
I've pushed up a couple of new branches that add the maintenance layout to clean.
There is only two lines difference so nice and easy introduction. Not too sure whether its a good idea but I've tested and it performs perfectly.
I've also noted the new layout file in the bootstrap upgrade.txt file. I didn't worry about that for the clean theme as I don't feel its needed there.
All squashed to a single commit as well.
Cheers
Sam
Thanks Sam, integrated in 2.5 and master. I changed the upgrade.txt text a little during integration
At the final step, after changing the theme back to standard and setting:
I tried dropping my DB and creating a fresh database, then trying to complete a browser installation. I'm getting an error:
Attaching screenshot
oh sorry, I meant to comment about it and forgot. Testing instructions need to be corrected. During integration we decided to go with only half of original fix.
Andrew, I removed the last part of testing instructions. Checking in standard theme also makes no sense because only bootstrapbase/clean were modified.
Sending back to testing
Hi Andrew Nicols,
Don't know if it's still relevant but your code you pasted a few comments up had a typo: sire-pre rather than side-pre.
no, not relevant any more David, this part of testing instructions was removed because the commit adding a new maintenance renderer was not integrated.
You did it!
Thanks for your contribution, this change has been merged upstream and is now available on your local git mirror and on download sites shortly.
Sam, we were just having a discussion in devchat about another theme failing for the same reason and it fails in function navbar() that unfortunately was not overwritten in maintenance pagelayout:
It looks like Clean theme uses clean/layout/columns1.php as layout for admin/index.php and tries to display navigation bar before the core is upgraded>Crescent City California News, Sports, & Weather | The Triplicate
His teammates shrieked with delight — they were winning.
One by one, Harold’s friends slithered down the track, first hands then feet propelling their scooters. When they finished the scooter relay first, Harold did a version of the popular “Gangnam Style” dance.
“We won both relays,” said the fourth-grader from Pine Grove Elementary School. “The hands weren’t as hard as the feet.”
Harold and his classmates joined fourth- and fifth-graders from across the county to celebrate Nutrition Adventure Day on Thursday. Mentored by 40 high school students, nearly 500 youngsters participated in relays and tag games, received healthy snacks and went home with a goodie bag full of information courtesy of the Del Norte County Unified School District’s Nutrition Project.
But after more than five years, the teens and youngsters were celebrated Nutrition Adventure Day for the last time.
“It’s bittersweet,” said Deborah Kravitz, the district’s director of food services. “A lot of work went into it.”
Nutrition Adventure Day is the culmination of a year’s worth of education Del Norte’s school kids have received from the Nutrition Project. But because the $500,000 Network for a Healthy California grant that funds the project is set to end in September, the Nutrition Project is expected to end at the end of this month.
Kravitz, who had been the Nutrition Project coordinator, will work next school year as the district’s director of food services, replacing retiring director Judy Wangerin. Most Nutrition Project staff members received layoff notices at the School Board’s April 25 meeting.
“We were all so disappointed to hear that the grant was ending,” said Knela Newton, a fourth-grade teacher at Joe Hamilton Elementary School. “We had fresh fruit and vegetables three days a week.”
Fourth- and fifth-graders race across the high school grounds during Nutrition Adventure Day. Del Norte Triplicate / Jessica CejnarOn Thursday, Newton’s 23 students stampeded en masse across the football field in a game reminiscent of Capture the Flag.
They were divided into two groups, fruits and vegetables, said Del Norte High sophomore Alberto Barraza. When a staff member held up a photo of a fruit or a vegetable, those players infiltrated the other side’s territory with their opponent hot on their tail. If a fruit tagged a vegetable, that vegetable would become part of the fruit team, and vice versa, he said.
Barraza, who helped fix the tape that denoted the makeshift court’s bounds, said he volunteered to participate in the program because he thought it sounded like fun.
When the buzzer sounded, signaling that it was time for the students to move to the next activity, Newton and her students headed over to the running man game. Another relay-type game, students stood on opposite sides, unwinding or winding a spool of rope with a plastic running figure attached. The first team whose “running man” did a full lap won.
“They’re having so much fun they don’t even know they’re exercising,” Newton said.
As her students look forward to summer vacation, Nutrition Adventure Day reinforces how important it is to choose healthy snacks and eat fresh fruits and vegetables whenever possible, Newton said.
The Nutrition Project is fun, said fourth-grader Ashley Mickee.
“It’s fun to try all the new foods we’ve never tried before,” she said, adding that her favorite was vanilla yogurt. “It’s part of the dairy family and it keeps the body healthy.”
Kravitz has said she is working to keep the Nutrition Program’s core programs, especially Harvest of the Month and garden-enhanced nutrition education. She is also working with the University of California’s Cooperative Extension program and Del Norte County’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to make sure local youths continue to receive nutrition education.Post-St. Paddy's VERY Lazy Sunday
The Season Tickets arrived in the mail on Friday night, and it was Christmas morning at the house. With the season so close it’s tangible, let’s take a quick Survivors’ Day (annually held on March 18th …you figure it out) trip around the bases.
Terry Pluto looks at what Spring Training determines and reports that the Futility IF job is down to Rouse and Luna with Luna’s shot of getting the spot being slim (pun intended) and none.
Sheldon Ocker thinks that Big League Choo’s career is over because of the Nixon signing…at the tender age of 24. Ocker, of course, fails to mention that Choo struck out 23 times in the last 19 games he played last season and is simply a phone call away in Buffalo. Details…details.
Ken Rosenthal reports on Andy Marte’s anxiety and updates the comebacks of 2 relievers on the Indians’ radar this past off-season.
Paul Hoynes dips into the “low payroll” barrel again for his Sunday contribution. He points out that the Royals are only $1M lower in total payroll than the Indians, omitting that the Royals are paying $11M to Mike Sweeney this year and will pay $7M to Gil Meche and $7.75M to Odalis Perez, neither of whom would crack the Indians’ current rotation.
When will Shapiro get credit for the contracts that the current Indians are playing under? The Indians are paying Sizemore $1M (15th highest on the team), and have him under club control until 2012 and somehow they are derided by the local media for having assembled young talent that isn’t drastically overpaid.
Very simply, it’s not how much money is spent; it is HOW the money is spent.
Just ask the Yankees and their World Series drought since 2000 while spending $978,129,386 (or an average of $163,021,564 annually) that they’ve spent in the 6 subsequent seasons if it’s a matter of dollars spent or wisdom in spending those dollars.
Finally, Andy Call gives a nice rundown of the Spring being enjoyed by Fausto Carmona, the Indians’ 5th starter for the first few weeks of the season.

Rescorla is credited with saving the lives of most of his co-workers and had returned to the building to search for survivors and was in it when it collapsed.
Rescorla grew up in Hayle, a village in Cornwall on England’s southwest coast and as a young man joined the British military. He fought against the Communist-backed insurgents in Cyprus from 1957-1960, and in Rhodesia from 1960-63.
After moving to the United States, he enlisted in the U.S. Army and fought with Americans during the Vietnam War.
His battles included the fight in the Ia Drang Valley in 1965. It was Rescorla’s picture that appeared on the cover of a book about that battle, We were Soldiers Once … and Young, written by Lt. Gen. Hal Moore and Joseph Galloway.
Moore described Rescorla as “the best platoon leader I ever saw.”
After the war, he returned to the United States and using his military benefits studied creative writing at the University of Oklahoma. He eventually earned a bachelor’s and a master’s degree in literature as well as a law degree.
A life-size bronze statue of Rescorla, based on the photo on the cover of the book about Ia Drang, is on permanent display at the National Infantry Museum at Fort Benning, Ga.

India's cricket board has appointed a three-member investigative panel to look into allegations of corruption in the Indian Premier League (IPL).
Its members are former law enforcement agency head RK Raghavan, former high court judge JN Patel and former Indian cricket captain Ravi Shastri.
It comes after an Indian court urged the board to probe spot-fixing claims against 13 players and officials.
The IPL is the world's richest cricket tournament.
The seventh edition of the 20-over tournament, which features eight teams of international players, began last week and runs until 1 June.
India's Supreme Court recently ordered N Srinivasan to stand down as chief of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) amid allegations that his son-in-law was involved with illegal betting.
Mr Srinivasan was elected head of cricket's world body, the International Cricket Council, in February. He is due to take up the role in July.
Former India captain and batting legend Sunil Gavaskar was installed as the interim head of the cricket board, and is responsible for overseeing the ongoing IPL tournament.
The last season of the IPL was dogged by allegations of spot-fixing and betting.
Spot-fixing involves players bowling wides and no-balls at certain times arranged beforehand with bookmakers. ‘self-styled guru’ – does it mean that after this ‘social (‘inverted’ fina ‘social uplift’ of the hijra. But, like I said before, there will be no real ‘social ‘silly […]When Mr. Bumble was told, in Dickens' Oliver Twist, that "the law supposes that your wife acts under your direction", the good man replied, "if the law supposes that [...] the law is an ass - an idiot. If that's the eye of the law, the law is a bachelor."
There are various ways in which modern law is not married to good sense. For example, one opinion of the United States Supreme Court tells us that your innocence is not constitutionally relevant to whether you should be executed. But.
The case involves a Pakistani called Noor Khan. I have met him. A habitually calm young man, he was understandably incensed when his father was killed - in one of the catastrophes of the US drone age - in the region of Pakistan that borders on Afghanistan. The drone strike was patently illegal; there is no war with Pakistan, and the Predator drone fired hellfire missiles that killed some fifty innocent elders who were holding a jirga or local council meeting, peacefully trying to resolve a local dispute over a chromite mine.
It was the equivalent of bombing the High Court in London. It was both the domestic crime of murder, and the international war crime of targeting civilians.
Sad to say, there is evidence that the British security services have been supplying the US with intelligence that has led to a number of these strikes. The simple claim that Khan was making, too late to save his father, was that GCHQ should not be allowed to do this if their own actions violate British and international law.
British domestic law criminalises the "intentional encouraging or assisting" of the crime of murder. The International Criminal Court Act of 2001 defines one crime against humanity as a mass killing of members of a civilian population. Another is an intentional attack against a person not taking a direct part in hostilities.
Those whose actions are being questioned are not soldiers risking their lives fighting a legal war (who are therefore covered by combatant immunity); they are intelligence officers who, sitting comfortably in Cheltenham over a cup of coffee, are instrumental in one of the most serious criminal acts.
The government's lawyers told the court that to "permit the validity of the acts of one sovereign state to be re-examined and perhaps condemned by the courts of another would very certainly 'imperil the amicable relations between governments and vex the peace of nations.'" The principle protects America from British criticism, and derives from an American case in 1897 dealing with the Venezuelan revolution. But more recently, another American court has described that precedent as an "airy castle", an insubstantial notion that has no clear link to the real world.
It is time for our courts to reconsider what we grandly term the "act of state doctrine." If a foreign government commits a crime, why should we not say so - indeed, why not shout it from the hilltops? The Americans certainly do, so long as it is a foreign country they don't really like.
Likewise, we know that Americans have tortured the last British resident in Guantánamo Bay, Shaker Aamer, into making false statements that might be used against him on his return to London. Surely a British court is not merely allowed to air all of this, but rather obliged to? And if the British are colluding with their American counterparts in committing war crimes around the world, surely it is time to just say no?
Why should national governments have the right to commit acts that would rightly send one of us to prison for many years?
It is a dangerous falsehood to claim - as some do - that we have too much law, when clearly, those who are being tortured or killed in our name have had not nearly enough. Here we have a court refusing to condemn murder and war crimes, because it might "embarrass" the Americans. It most certainly should.

The US won their first game under Klinsmann on Saturday
BRIAN SCIARETTA - Sunday, October 9, 2011
The US national team defeated Honduras on Saturday night by a narrow 1-0 scoreline for Jurgen Klinsmann's first win as their coach.
The game had positive moments but it further highlighted that the US national team is still a work in progress.
For the positives, left back is not a weakness at the moment as Chandler was significantly improved from the Belgium game at his new position. Also Jozy Altidore was constantly dangerous and Clint Dempsey shined as the number 10.
Brek Shea has earned the right to be in the starting 11 for the national team and Danny Williams played out of position on the right but he clearly has talent to be a big part of the team moving forward.
As for the weaknesses, the most obvious right now is in central defense. Michael Orozco Fiscal looked lost again and it should only be a matter of time before Klinsmann explores other options like Omar Gonzalez and George John. Oguchi Onyewu's return was promising but he still needs more games before he is back to his old self.
There was also problems in central midfield as Maurice Edu's passing game was ineffective and Beckerman struggled with containing Honduran attackers.
From central midfield to central defense, the entire middle of the field was a problem for the US team and most of the offense had to come from the wings. The best solution for the upcoming game against Ecuador would be to start Michael Bradley in the middle of the field along with Danny Williams who is naturally a central midfielder.
USMNT player ratings
Starters
Tim Howard - 8 - Man of the Match
Outstanding performance. He made four impressive saves that kept the US in the game. His best was a one on one against Jerry Bengston in the 19th minute.
Steve Cherundolo - 6 -
A solid performance from the long time vet as he continues to show why he is still the team's right back.
Michael Orozco Fiscal - 4 -
This game was an important test for Orozco as he needed a strong performance to show he belongs on the US national team. Unfortunately he came up short and was beaten numerous times by Honduras.
Carlos Bocanegra - 5 -
It wasn't the best game for the US national team captain. He was better than Orozco positionally but his distribution out of the back was lacking.
Timothy Chandler - 6.5 -
Chandler's second game at left back was much better than his first last month against Belgium. His combination play with Brek Shea created numerous opportunities. Still, he must improve his passing with his left foot.
Kyle Beckerman - 5 -
Beckerman had a decent game in defensive midfield against Honduras but he will struggle as the competition gets stronger.
Danny Williams - 6 -
It was a very solid debut for the German-born Williams who was not at all familiar with the US national team prior to camp. He was comfortable on the ball and his defense was also effective. Normally a central midfielder, Williams was out of position at right midfield but he looked like he will help the team moving forward.
Maurice Edu - 4.5 -
Edu had an off night for the US team against Honduras as he struggled with his passing game and was not effective moving the ball forward into the final third.
Brek Shea - 7 -
Shea was a handful for the Honduran defense all night on the left and he was a key part of the scoring opportunities for the US team. He missed a sitter in the second half but he still had a very strong performance and his combination play with Chandler is developing well.
Clint Dempsey - 7.5 -
Dempsey showed that he is the probably the best US player at the moment as Honduras struggled to contain him all game. His goal showed an incredible amount of skill and he should have had a second but the goal was called back after he was incorrectly whistled for a foul.
Jozy Altidore - 6.5 -
After a disappointing performance against Belgium in the last US game, Altidore played with more purpose and had his hand in numerous scoring opportunities. It's only a matter of time before he breaks out under Klinsmann's system.
Substitutes
Oguchi Onyewu - 5.5 -
It was Onyewu's first cap under Klinsmann and he improved the defense in the second half. He still has a way to go to return to the level he was at before his knee injury two years ago but he now appears to be on the right track.
DaMarcus Beasley - 6.5 -
Beasley's speed and craftiness helped the US regain control of the match after Honduras was pressing for an equalizer. He stretched the defense and was part of several scoring chances.
Michael Bradley - 6 -
After missing last two US games, Bradley showed that he is still an important part of the US team as his minutes. He was calm on the ball and in control of the midfield. He should clearly start for the US team.
Jonathan Spector - 6 -
When Spector came on for Timothy Chandler he had a positive impact on the match. While he has struggled the past few years with the US national team, Spector looked comfortable and he had a beautiful cross that found Dempsey. Dempsey scored but the goal was incorrectly disallowed for a phantom foul.
Juan Agudelo -5.5 -
Agudelo did not have much of an opportunity to make an impact but he looked decent in his performance. He has talent but is still a work in progress.Held on the lawn at the county’s Government Center off Mountain Ranch Road, the annual event precedes the Calaveras County Fair and Jumping Frog Jubilee, held May 15 to 18 at the county fairgrounds in Angels Camp.

As you all know in recent weeks there was quite a lot of noise regarding PRISM. Thanks to Mr Snowden we all know that biggest internet companies have been very “open” where it comes to user data. Beside other implications it is worth to know that NSA had (and probably still has) very easy access to most popular e-mail services. There is one guy however who can help with that. From what we have learned, Mr Snowden was using secure e-mail service called Lavabit. After NSA data were made public Lavabit was forced by authorities to shut down. So, what an average user can do now? Right now, we have to wait. Another famous internet personality, Mr Kim Dotcom has announced that he is preparing to lunch new and secure e-mail service with servers located outside USA.
Our advice to all of you would be to (for now) search for alternative service and if you want to make sure no one reads your messages (just because they can) to also use VPN when your internet connection is active.
Here is why. As you know there are “bad” people in the world. Hackers, scammers, etc. The bad news is that they can work for anyone. As it also happens (this is even more disturbing) Mr Snowden was not actually employee of NSA but of an outside, private company. Now, imagine situation where someone with doggy intentions works for one of those companies. Unlike Mr S. he can search and gather data for his own benefit. With access to e-mail servers such person can easily look for certain data inside your messages, with access to ISP servers they will have full access to all your internet activity. Are you cool with that?
We would like to remind you all, that it is in your power to change all that. You can use different e-mail services than those provided by Google, Yahoo and Microsoft. You can use secure, encrypted VPN connections at all times. This way your messages will remain private, if your US ISP allows for access to its servers with VPN shield all your traffic and places you visit in the internet will remain secret.
It is very easy to setup and your increased security does not have to be expensive. HideIPVPN would like to remind you about on-going promotion of our VPN and SmartDNS packages.

This year's matchup will have a tough task of living up to last year's spectacle between the New York Giants and New England Patriots. While we won't be seeing a rematch of that game since the Giants didn't make the playoffs, we could still end up seeing an insane matchup.
Let's take a look at the more exciting potential matchups for Super Bowl Sunday on February 3.
New England Patriots vs. Seattle Seahawks
This would be the quintessential David vs. Goliath game.
The New England Patriots are the best football team of the new millennium, and have shown no signs of slipping up as they enter the playoffs with another a first-round bye and are one of the favorites to win the Super Bowl this year.
On the other side, the Seahawks are led by rookie quarterback, Russell Wilson, who few expected to be a starter in his NFL career.
Now, Wilson is playing as well as anyone and has Seattle playing at a high level.
Everybody loves watching a Cinderella story, and there would be no team the Seahawks could beat in the Super Bowl that would be more momentous than the Patriots.
Denver Broncos vs. San Francisco 49ers
Playing the hottest football in the NFL and led by superstar Peyton Manning, the Broncos are the Super Bowl favorite.
A clash with the stingy 49ers defense would be a must-see game—not to mention the storyline that comes with it: Manning facing off against one of the teams he turned down in his free agency cycle.
Colin Kaepernick led San Francisco to some exciting wins this season, but many are wondering if he's prepared to lead his team into the playoffs. With his dual-threat ability and big play potential, he'd also be an entertaining matchup to watch against the Broncos stingy defense.
Defense wins championships, and these two squads boast two of the best defensive units in the league.That alone is enough to crave this match-up, not to mention the culmination of an epic comeback season for Manning.
Atlanta Falcons vs. Baltimore Ravens
Not many stories have been beaten to death more than Matt Ryan and Atlanta's playoff woes, so it's safe to say a good deal of NFL fans are rooting for the Falcons to make a deep run in January.
Put that together with the Baltimore Ravens playing not only for their second franchise title, but to show Ray Lewis the exit as a champion, and you have an insane showdown for Super Bowl Sunday.
Ray Lewis is one of the best players the league has ever seen, and his motivational advantage may be too much for the AFC's elite to overcome. On top of that, every NFL fan would want to tune in to see if he finishes his career with a championship.
Joe Flacco hasn't always felt the love in Baltimore and has often been the scapegoat for early exits from the postseason, just as Ryan has been for Atlanta. A win would give one of these QB's a chance to cement their name on the sports world's biggest stage.Learn something new every day

Zoology is the study of the biology and environments of animals. A career in zoology requires at least a bachelor’s degree in one of the life sciences. Most colleges offer zoology courses as part of education in the life sciences, but it is becoming less common for them to offer specific zoology degree programs, although some still do. An advanced zoology degree will require enrolling in a master’s degree or Ph.D. program in a field of natural science at a university.
Degrees such as a Bachelor’s of Art or Science in Biology, Zoology, Wildlife Management, Environmental Policy, or Studies and Conservation are all good preparation for a career in zoology. Zoologists can work in a variety of sub-fields like research, education, conservation, veterinary medicine, resource management, and agriculture.
While getting your bachelor’s degree, you will want to take courses that focus on animal biology, wildlife, or policy issues related to animals, depending on your interests. Talk to your professors to find out about the research they are doing and whether there are opportunities for students to get involved. You might look to local zoos, animal hospitals, and wildlife and animal rescue organizations to see if they have internship opportunities. These experiences will enhance your education in zoology as well as make you more attractive when you are looking for a job or pursuing further study.
An advanced zoology degree requires between two to seven years of study, on average. As with the undergraduate degrees, a specialization in zoology can be undertaken in several fields in the life sciences. A master’s degree is usually accomplished in two years, while a Ph.D. usually takes between five to seven years. For a higher level zoology degree you can expect to take more advanced classes, including several on how to conduct research, and complete your own research. For a Ph.D. program, expect to conduct extensive individual research, apply for research funding, and write and attempt to publish scientific articles with your research results.
In general, students must pay tuition for their master’s degree, while Ph.D. students are funded by the university, grants, teaching or assistantships during most or all of their studies. Some universities offer co-op degree programs with federal agencies such as the U.S. Department of Fish and Wildlife.

In Los Angeles or San Francisco? It’s a good day to multitask. How often can you save Chihuahuas, eat tacos, and score a very affordable Mexican vacation all at the same time?
Virgin America has just announced new service to Cabo and Cancun from LAX and SFO starting this December. To celebrate, they’re offering everyone special $129 fares from those airports to Mexico for the next three days.
Now the tricky part: If you happen to be passing through the airport in LA or San Francisco OR if you happen by a Virgin America promotional taco trucks parked in those cities, you can score 2-for-1 tacos (yum!) and 2-for-1 tickets to Cancun or Cabo.
How to score 2-for-1 tacos and/or 2-for-1 airfares:
- Download a free Loopt Star iPhone app here or here. Loopt Star allows you to check in at participating bars, shops, and restaurants to score discounts and exclusives
- In San Francisco, anytime between 11 am and 3 pm PST, head to the the Los Compadres taco truck parked at 100 Folsom Street, find the Virgin America people, and check in on Loopt Star
- In Los Angeles, between 11 am and 3 pm PST, head to 7060 Hollywood Boulevard, find the Virgin Atlantic employees at the Border Grill taco truck, and check in on Loopt Star.
- Get your tacos and tickets!
- If you’re at the airports, just check-in with Loopt Star. No tacos, alas, but the airfare special will save you enough for lots and lots of tacos when you arrive south of the border
Where do the Chihuahuas come in? Proceeds from every taco sold today go to the Chihuahua rescue efforts of the San Francisco Animal Care and Control. (Remember the big Chihuahua airlift that Virgin America participated in last fall?)
So don’t let the suspension of Mexicana flights harsh your mellow Mexican winter vacation plans: save a Chihuahua and score a flight today.

In February 2011, Mayor Barrella announced that he would seek a second four-year term in the November 2011 city elections.[1]
The November 2010 recall vote was scheduled by a New Jersey Superior Court judge after a protected battle over whether recall supporters had collected enough signatures to force the vote.[2]
Petitions requesting a recall election were filed the week of July 18, 2009. Recall organizers announced that their motivation for seeking the recall was Barella's plan to raise city taxes.
A lengthy and complex series of events regarding the signatures filed by recall proponents, and whether there were enough signatures, soon dragged both recall supporters and opponents into court with the most recent action by a judge in January 2010 to order that a recall vote take place. Barella indicated that he would appeal the judge's decision, which means that future court actions could conceivably result in the cancellation of the currently scheduled recall vote.[2]
Stewart Fischer was a leader in the recall effort.
Republican no more
Barella has filed to run for the position of mayor in the same election where he might be recalled, on November 2, as an independent candidate. The local Republican Party, on whose ticket Barella used to run, instead has placed the name of Stephen D. Reid on its ballot line for November. This led Barella to say, "Make no mistake, there is a deep philosophical divide between myself and those who control the Republican Club. I believe that as Republicans we should be looking out for all of the residents and taxpayers of Point Pleasant Beach, not simply the powerful few. Those in control of the Republican Club have a different vision, they have consistently demonstrated that they are willing to put the interests of the powerful few first. It is, therefore, not surprising that they have chosen to back someone whose way of thinking is more in line with their approach."[3]
Path to the ballot
884 valid signatures are required to force a recall vote.
- July 18, 2009: 1,200 signatures on 66 pages were submitted to Point Pleasant Beach election officials.
- July 22, 2009: Barella lodges a challenge to the signatures, asserting that two petition circulators (Joseph Billoti and Frank Storino) did not have the right to vote in the borough because they are residents of other towns.[4][5]
- August 6, 2009: City Clerk Maryann Ellsworth declared that the petition was invalid because one of the circulators failed to sign a document where required.[6] Altogether, Ellsworth disqualified 400 of the 1,200 signatures, leaving recall sponsors short by 77 of the required number of signatures.
- August 20, 2009: Recall supporters file a lawsuit contesting Ellsworth's declaration, and arguing that 121 of the 400 disqualified signatures should be re-certified.[7]
- September 8, 2009: A hearing is held in New Jersey Superior Court to determine whether any signatures should be re-certified. During the hearing, petition circulator Joseph Billoti testified that he is a resident of Point Pleasant Beach, citing his address as within the city limits.[8]
- September 28, 2009: New Jersey Superior Court Judge Joseph Foster ruled that the recall vote could not be scheduled for the November 2009 ballot because he would not be issuing a decision before October 5 at the earliest and, if he ruled in favor of recall supporters, this would not allow sufficient time for replacement candidates to file their papers to appear on the recall ballot.[9]
- October 2009: Hearings proceed in Judge Foster's court on the validity of various petition signatures.[10]
- November 30, 2009: The court orders Barella to cease his accusations about the motivations of the recall supporters. The court order came after Barella questioned Councilman Frank Rizzo about political connections to the committee that is attempting to oust him from office. According to Judge Joseph Foster, who administered the rebuke: “What you are attempting to do here is get involved in the merits of this recall petition. What I am not going to allow here is for this to become a forum for consideration to whether this recall petition and the movement behind it was wrong."[11]
- January 25, 2010: Judge Foster declares that Borough Clerk Ellsworth was wrong to invalidate some of the signatures she invalidated, and that when those improperly invalidated signatures are added back in to the count of valid signatures, then recall proponents did in fact collect sufficient signatures to force a recall. Foster orders that the election be scheduled for November 2, 2010. Barella says he will appeal.[2]
- May 24, 2010: A two-judge appellate court agrees with Judge Foster's January decision that sufficient valid signatures were submitted to force a recall election.[12]

>> Ken: Hi, I'm Ken German, Senior Editor here at CNET.com. Today we're gonna take a first look at the LG Accolade also called the VX5600; this is a new phone for Verizon Wireless service. What we have here is a very midrange phone, very simple in design, pretty simple in features. A basic flip-phone; this is supposed to be sort of a blue color it looks a little more bluish silver to me. Also here we have a reflective surface on the top. It does kind of catch your fingerprints pretty easily; it smudges and catches the light though. On the back a pretty plain rear-face. The camera's actually located above the external display. I thought that the external display was fine maybe could have been a bit bigger for the type of phone but it is full color so it shows everything you need. Inside, very nice display. It is a little smaller but it is pretty bright and vibrant, colorful, shows graphics pretty well, menus are very easy to use, simply designed. We have the icon format here. Down below you'll find the keypad controls and navigation buttons. Nice navigation array, it's pretty spacious, pretty tactile so very simple to use. I didn't have any problems, didn't misdial and was able to use by feel, which is very nice. Down below the keypad buttons, very large numbers on this keypad. LG usually does a pretty good job by giving us large numbers. Letters are a little smaller but the whole thing is brightly back-lit so you shouldn't have any problems. Inside you'll find midrange features like Bluetooth, speaker phone, organizer options, there's the camera and, of course, the voice dialing so if you're looking for a midrange phone that's easy to use with just a couple extra features besides making calls this is a good option. I'm Ken German and this is the LG Accolade for Verizon Wireless. ^E00:01:31Poll: Do You Like Tart Frozen Yogurt? Tart Frozen Yogurt: Love It or Hate It?

BBC Television ServiceAfter New Jersey Nets CEO Brett Yormark stated that, contrary to a report from the day before, the team was not considering playing preseason games at the Prudential Center in Newark, a commenter on this blog yesterday asked: "Is Newark really dead as Yormark says or is this just part of a negotiating ploy to get a better deal?"
Well, in Day 3 of the saga, the Star-Ledger reported last night that New Jersey Devils owner Jeff Vanderbeek told the Nets "that he had every intention of making a proposal to host Nets preseason games at the Prudential Center and was surprised that the team abruptly stopped negotiations."
The dispute was apparently over money, with the Nets asking Vanderbeek's Devils to guarantee a gate count typical in the regular season, even though preseason games, as Vanderbeek wrote, "typically play to half the audience of a regular-season game."
Middle ground?
There must be some middle ground in this dispute over price. After all, the Nets, like other NBA teams (and probably hockey teams, too), routinely inflate their attendance.
And, more importantly, the Nets this season are giving tickets away. For free. The Nets need more fan revenue and fan support, and the Izod Center clearly is no longer "the perfect setting for us right now," as Yormark said six weeks ago. Vanderbeek (and the city of Newark) need to get more action in the new arena.
(A petition drive has begun by Nets fans who pledge to buy tickets if the team plays at The Rock.)
That fact that they seem to be negotiating via the Star-Ledger doesn't exactly suggest harmony. But it's in both sides' interest to work something out.

Here’s an overly simplistic representation of what was causing the “String or binary data would be truncated.” error message:
1: declare @where nvarchar(max);
2: -- assume something put a large string in @where (over 8000 characters).
3: declare @sql nvarchar(max);
4: select @sql = replace(‘select * from table1 where {0} order by column1 asc’, ‘{0}’, @where);
5: exec (@sql);
The reason I experienced this error is because of how replace handles nvarchar(max). By explicitly casting the first parameter to nvarchar(max), the error is resolved.
4: select @sql = replace(cast(‘select * from table1 where {0} order by column1 asc’ as nvarchar(max)), ‘{0}’, @where);
From the documentation:
If string_expression is not of type varchar(max) or nvarchar(max), REPLACE truncates the return value at 8,000 bytes. To return values greater than 8,000 bytes, string_expression must be explicitly cast to a large-value data type.
We’ve recently translated one of our applications and thought we’d share the tools & techniques we used. In particular, every time we perform some ASP.NET translation, we hit a few gotchas. We kept facing the same problems every time we worked on translation, so we figured we might as well write everything down in a post for everyone’s benefit.
Because we’re translating an ASP.NET WebForms application, the main process is to open an *.aspx or *.ascx, switch to Design view, and perform Tools –> Generate Local Resource. This generates a *.resx file and adds the relevant markup in your source file. Tools are available to perform the actual translation and create the *.resx files in other languages.
The core issue here is that you need to perform this operation for each individual file. Potentially thousands of times and/or until you go crazy. (Personally, I find it frustrating that bulk resource generation is not a core VS.NET feature. )
Instead of wasting our time opening each individual file, we found a macro on this forum. The macro does not run in VS.NET 2012, so we loaded up our old VS.NET 2010 and ran it from there.
The macro wasn’t flawless – it sometimes randomly crashed after processing files for half an hour. Deleting Visual Studio’s *.suo file and restarting it seemed to help.
I assume one of the reasons bulk resource generation is not a core VS.NET feature is because the feature is (in addition to being slow) partially broken.
At a high level, any script blocks in your *.aspx/*.ascx files are vulnerable to deletion. Generate Local Resource will simply strip them out if they are contained in an <asp:UpdatePanel …/>. We filed a bug on Microsoft Connect which was not deemed important enough to be fixed.
This is appalling because it will introduce pernicious bugs in your application that only show up at runtime, if you don’t pay close attention to each and every individual file.
For example:
<script>alert('<%="Some Constant" %>');</script>
<script>alert('<%= btnSomething.ClientID %>');</script>
<%-- <asp:Button --%>
<%
if (Request.QueryString["test"]=="bye")
Response.Write("Goodbye World");
else
Response.Write("Hello World");
%>
Would become the following, after Generate Local Resource, because everything
<script>alert('');</script>
Admittedly, some of the inline code above is bad practice. However, the silent deletion causes needle-in-a-haystack type bugs at runtime.
We decided to remove all of our inline code blocks from our code to avoid having issues during local resource generation.
These values, added in the *.aspx header, force the page to change culture based on the browser’s settings. In our application, this was not desirable as it by-passed the logic defined in our Global.asax file. (Our users can change their language via the web applications itself, not via their web browser settings.)
For more information, see this post by Rick Strahl.
When trying to localize a LinkButton containing an Image and literal, the Image will be dropped.
<asp:LinkButton
<asp:Image</asp:Image>
HELLO!
</asp:LinkButton>
Becomes:
<asp:LinkButton
To solve this issue, the nested controls must be separated.
If you are using <ajax:Accordion ../> from the ASP.NET Ajax control toolkit, be aware that it will be corrupted after generating *.resx files. The fix is simple: delete the erroneously added Accordion Extender.
Your *.aspx/*.ascx files and your *.cs files may contain additional strings which must be extracted. Back in 2008, we had create a Macro to help with this process but in this iteration, we simply used JetBrains ReSharper. The VS.NET plugin made it easy to find strings which had not been extracted, and push them into *.resx files. ReSharper is jam-packed with other useful features, but we’ve found that it does have a significant impact on performance in our solution.
Back in 2008, we released a web application to help translate RESX files. We’re no longer using this application – there are better options out there. We picked Zeta Resource Editor and it worked nicely.
The tools available today are much better than they were five years ago, but one piece of the puzzle (Generate Local Resource) is still far from perfect. We’d love to see an improved version (in either VS.NET or ReSharper) which would:

The default validators inside ASP.NET Web Forms are quite uninteresting and require some styling work to look adequate. Recently, we’ve been using the qTip2 jQuery library and we love it. qTip enables you to add visually pleasant tooltips to any element. For example, you simply add a “title” attribute to any element and then apply qTip to this element and the “title” attribute will be used as the tooltip’s text. This is the simplest use case. Here’s an example; with our FranchiseBlast registration form.
When you try to submit this form and the validation doesn’t pass, we replaced the default ASP.NET validators with styled qTip tooltips beside each validated element.
Like you can see, the validators have absolute positioning, which enables them to flow outside of the bounds of the registration panel. We could also easily change the position of the bubble in relation to the validated element and also change the bubble tip position.
Let’s take a look at what was needed to accomplish this, using a simple ASP.NET project. Here is the main ASP.NET code for the ASPX page. Nothing fancy: a simple form with some validators:
<asp:ScriptManager
<Scripts>
<asp:ScriptReference
<asp:ScriptReference
<asp:ScriptReference
</Scripts>
</asp:ScriptManager>
<fieldset class="Validate" style="width: 300px">
<legend>Tell us about yourself</legend>
<div>
<span class="label">Business Name:</span>
<asp:TextBox
<asp:RequiredFieldValidator
</div>
<div class="alternate">
<span class="label">Your Name:</span>
<asp:TextBox
<asp:RequiredFieldValidator
<span class="label">Your Email:</span>
<asp:TextBox
<asp:RequiredFieldValidator
<asp:RegularExpressionValidator
</fieldset>
<asp:Button
Starting from the top, we need jQuery and also qTip to be added to our page. The interesting JavaScript code in located in ~/Scripts/validators.js. The rest of the code here is a simple ASP.NET form. One important thing is that each element to be validated is enclosed in a <div> with his corresponding validators. This is important because we will use this convention later in our script to find the associated validators for an input control.
I also have to mention that I added some lines in the .skin file of the App_Theme:
<asp:RequiredFieldValidator
<asp:CustomValidator
<asp:RangeValidator
<asp:CompareValidator
<asp:RegularExpressionValidator
This will force CssClass=”ErrorMsg” on validators. This will be used next in our JavaScript code to find the validators:
Sys.WebForms.PageRequestManager.getInstance().add_pageLoaded(function () {
function getValidator() {
return $(this).parent().find('.ErrorMsg').filter(function () { return $(this).css('display') != 'none'; });
}
var inputs = '.Validate input:text, .Validate select, .Validate input:password';
var submit = $('input:submit');
var q = $(inputs).qtip({
position: {
my: 'center left',
at: 'center right'
},
content: {
text: function (api) {
return getValidator.call(this).html();
}
show: {
ready: true,
event: 'none'
hide: {
style: {
classes: 'ui-tooltip-red ui-tooltip-shadow ui-tooltip-rounded'
events: {
show: function (event, api) {
var $this = api.elements.target;
var validator = getValidator.call($this);
if (validator.length == 0)
event.preventDefault();
});
if (window.Page_ClientValidate != undefined) {
function afterValidate() {
$(inputs).each(function () {
var validator = getValidator.call(this);
if (validator.length > 0) {
var text = validator.html();
$(this).addClass('Error').qtip('show').qtip('option', 'content.text', text);
// validator.hide();
}
else
$(this).removeClass('Error').qtip('hide');
$(inputs).blur(afterValidate);
var oldValidate = Page_ClientValidate;
Page_ClientValidate = function (group) {
oldValidate(group);
afterValidate.call(this);
submit.removeAttr('disabled');
});
There is much to explain in this code. First we register a new function to be executed each time there’s an ASP.NET PostBack on the page here: Sys.WebForms.PageRequestManager.getInstance().add_pageLoaded(function () { … });
The function getValidator finds the visible ASP.NET validators associated to a control to be validated. We use the fact that the control to validate and the validators are contained inside a <div>.
We apply qTip to the inputs to validate and we get the text of the message by finding the visible validators. Also we have some logic to prevent showing the qTip element if there aren’t any visible validators.
We also do some monkey patching at the end where we inject our own code inside the Page_ClientValidate ASP.NET JavaScript method. To do that, we simply get a reference to the Page_ClientValidate function, create a new function with our additional code (calling the old Page_ClientValidate) plus we override window.Page_ClientValidate with our new function. This new function have both the new and old functionality.
You would probably have to modify this code a little bit to fit your needs, but this shows how you could integrate qTip2 for nicer validators in ASP.NET Web Forms.
All of the developers at LavaBlast use three monitors; utilizing multiple monitors has significantly increased our efficiency. However, Microsoft Excel doesn’t work particularly well in a multi-monitor setup. By default, every time you open a new Excel file, its contents are displayed within the same instance. You have to manually launch other instances of Excel to have one instance per monitor, which is time consuming.
It is possible to configure Microsoft Excel to load one Window per file, but it involves a number of obscure configuration settings & registry changes. Every time we move to a new machine, this configuration needs to be redone. The information is spread out on a number of sites/forums and it takes a while to re-discover the sources. his post aims at centralizing this information.
In particular, this post focuses on Microsoft Excel 2010 on Windows 7 64-bit. I believe the fix works on other versions as well; feel free to comment on this blog post if the steps are different.
Excel 2010:
Excel 2007:
Once this change is done, every time you double click on an Excel file in Windows Explorer, a new instance of Excel will open. However, you’ll probably encounter the following error.
Each Excel file you open from Windows Explorer now launches in its own separate window. However, Excel spits out “There was a problem sending the command to the program” and leaves the Excel window blank. You can drag & drop your existing file to this window to open it, but this is still painful. We will need to change the system registry to solve this issue; please refrain from doing this is you are not comfortable with the reg edit tool.
Excel should now load separate Windows for each file you open. This setup will consume more memory, but will vastly increase your productivity.
Troubleshooting note:
Thanks to Turbo2001rt for the final important tweaks.
We’re just about to release the version 4.0.0 of our franchise point of sale system. One of the most noteworthy change is the fact we’ve given the look & feel a major overhaul, thanks to jQuery Mobile which we’ve blogged about previously. We thought we’d take a minute to share with you what makes it so special!
First off, I’ve recorded a short video featuring a variation of our franchise POS for the Teddy Mountain franchise. Teddy Mountain provides the stuff your own teddy bear experience to children worldwide and have been using our POS since 2006.
As you’ll see, I focus on a few of our differentiators in the point of sale space. We’re not a point of sale company and our POS is not conventional: we’re a franchise software company and we’ve created the best point of sale system for a franchise environment.
We bake in a franchise’s unique business processes into the point of sale, making it very powerful while still extremely easy to use. By integrating our point of sale with FranchiseBlast, we’ve also eliminated dozens of standardization/uniformity issues which face small retail chains or franchises.
Furthermore, we’ve given additional focus to cross-browser compatibility in this release as our POS is not only used regular POS hardware (in brick & mortar stores) but also on the Apple iPad for back office operations an for managing the warehouses that feed our franchise e-commerce websites. We’re definitely excited by the potential tablets have for both retail and service-based franchises! Expect more news from us in this space soon!
In the meantime, if you know of small chains / new franchises which want to explore disruptive technologies in their locations, we hope you’ll point them in our direction!
We!

You decide to save it to your home screen.
If you’re doing this with a web application you’ve developed, you probably want to make it appear a bit more like a native app, so you’ll add two meta tags to make the experience nicer (add an app icon and remove the navigation bar). Remember: Safari caches these tags when creating the shortcut, so you will need to delete/recreate the shortcut to force it to refresh.
Everything will look fine, until you reload the web app on some other occasion: ASP.NET Ajax is now completely broken and many of your styles are missing. Simply put, an application that worked fine when you shut down your iPad minutes ago will be completely unusable. No amount of refreshing will solve the issue. Clearing Safari’s cache and using it outside of the home screen icon is the only workaround.
The iPad (and iPhone/iPod Touch) don’t use the same HTTP User-Agent string when a website is accessed normally via the Safari application versus a webpage that was saved to the home screen (which still uses Safar internally). Here’s an example:

On and off over the course of a month, I spent dozens of hours investigating this issue. In the end, the fix is trivial and updated *.browser files will probably be produced by Microsoft over the next months/years. However, I did learn a lot about how to debug a web-app on the iPad in the process, and thought I’d share a few lessons learned. I’ve kept them purposefully brief as you can easily find detailed answers on Google or StackOverflow.
That’s how I figured out ASP.NET AJAX wasn’t loading properly. Was getting JavaScript errors that you normally get when ASP.NET Ajax is not properly configured in the web.config file.
I frequently use Firebug on my desktop computer to analyse web pages. The lite version on the iPad helped me review the HTML/JavaScript in greater detail. Install this bookmarklet (found it painful to do) then install the FireBug Lite bookmarklet. More info here.
This helped me get in-depth information about exactly what HTML/JavaScript was being served in response to which HTTP Headers. That’s how I realized certain scripts were not being included when the User-Agent changed.
As everyone knows, Flash doesn’t work on the iPad/iPhone/iPod. It doesn’t come as a surprise to use that we have to eliminate it from our app (not a big detail for us).
However, one gotcha that had not come to mind initially is that certain JavaScript functionality such as click&drag or drag&drop does not work on the iPad given the differences in gestures between a conventional computer and a tablet. That code needs to be rewritten.
Did you experience any issues you’d like to share?
Recently, for a new franchise client of ours, we had to add some new features to our web-based point of sale system. This piece of software makes extensive use of touch screen functionality; we need to think about this when we design our UI. The interface must be optimized to allow cashiers to perform their operations effectively and intuitively with a touch screen. Our application isn’t traditionally used via a multi-touch interface like the iPhone or iPad; rather, operators use a traditional touch screen. In this project, we had to adapt existing pages and create completely new modules.
In the past, we had played with jQuery Mobile and we were really impressed. Take a look at the demo site – all you need to do is including a reference to jQuery Mobile’s JavaScript and follow some conventions with your HTML to get a nice mobile-friendly user interface. However, when you think about it, mobile-friendly (touch friendly) user interfaces are also very appropriate for traditional touch screen technologies utilized by the retail industry for over a decade.
Given our point of sale was initially created to be compatible with IE6 back in the day, we felt it was time to enhance the look and feel utilizing new technologies. We liked jQuery Mobile’s look & feel and wanted to utilize some bits & pieces, without having to re-implement everything following their conventions. When you peek at the jQuery Mobile source code on GitHub, you realize that each component is separated in it’s own little jQuery plugin. Some plugins are not completely independent from the jQM (jQuery Mobile) page, but you can use most of them outside of that context; you can thus use them in your own applications without a jQM page that takes 100% of the screen real estate. In a typical jQM scenario, you define a page and then jQM works it’s magic: it initializes all the controls for you - if you followed the conventions. In this post, we’ll cover using jQuery Mobile outside of the jQM page and mobile context.
First, you simply have to trick jQM into thinking that there’s a jQM page in the HTML. To do that, you have to bind to a special jQM event, mobileinit. This is event is executed before any jQM code modifies your html:
$(document).bind("mobileinit", function ()
if ($('div[data-role=page]').length === 0)
$('<div data-</div>').appendTo($('body'));
$.mobile.ajaxEnabled = false;
$('#pageTemp').live('pagebeforecreate', function (event)
{
return false;
})
Here you insert a jQM page in your html if one hasn’t already been defined. This is required for some controls to work (like the dropdown list, if I remember correctly). We then disable AJAX page fetching and also disable the 'pagebeforecreate' event for the newly created dummy page. Most of our pages utilize this placeholder (as we only use the UI controls), but we did – on a few occasions - utilize the standard jQM page in all its glory inside our point of sale.
If there’s a better way to do this, please let us know - with the current version of jQuery Mobile (1.0a4.1) it appears to be working pretty well.
The plugins we found most interesting were the one dealing with forms controls. You can see a gallery of all forms elements in jQuery Mobile here.
For example, some of the base HTML controls are not ideal in the context of a touch-enabled application. Take radio buttons, for example. They are way too small and hard to click on accurately - you have to manually change their styling via CSS to make them easy to touch. Here is the jQM version of radio button list:
To create this, first you need a little bit HTML plus the checkboxradio plugin from jQuery Mobile:
<fieldset data-
<input type="radio" name="radio-choice-1" id="radio-choice-1" value="Cat">
<input type="radio" name="radio-choice-2" id="radio-choice-2" value="Dog">
<input type="radio" name="radio-choice-3" id="radio-choice-3" value="Hamster" checked="checked">
<input type="radio" name="radio-choice-4" id="radio-choice-4" value="Lizard">
Basically the fieldset groups the radio input together and gives the rounded corners only to the top and bottom items.
Then you can add this JavaScript to your page:
$('input[type=checkbox], input[type=radio]').filter(function ()
return $(this).parent('.ui-checkbox').length == 0;
}).checkboxradio();
$("fieldset[data-role='controlgroup']").not('.ui-controlgroup').controlgroup();
This piece of JavaScript will select all checkboxes or radios inputs, filter the ones we already applied the plugin and then call checkboxradio() to change them to follow the jQuery Mobile style. We then use the controlgroup plugin to group the controls together visually. Once again we don’t re-apply this code to fieldsets that were changed previously, for efficiency reasons.
For an horizontal look, simply add data-style=”horizontal” to the fieldset grouping the elements. It is still a radio button list, but the layout is different.
You can even do the same thing with checkboxes:
Suddenly, your UI becomes much easier to use with a touchscreen.
Here is a dropdown list, in the jQuery Mobile style:
You simply execute the following JavaScript code:
$('select:not([multiple="multiple"])').selectmenu();
We had some problems with multi-selection lists, so that’s why we don’t automatically style those.
Buttons are pretty straightforward. In our application, we decided to automatically transform all of our buttons which utilize the CSS class ‘button’. This could be an input[type=button], input[type=submit], a simple link <a></a>. We’re using a mix of these in our application and modify them all like this:
$('.button').not('.ui-btn').button();
Above, the two buttons are inline (add the data-inline=”true” attribute to the HTML elements). The Save button has a different theme (specify data-theme=”b”)
You can also group buttons as above, by defining a horizontal controlgroup.
<div data-role="controlgroup" data-type=”horizontal”>
<a href="index.html" data-Yes</a>
<a href="index.html" data-No</a>
<a href="index.html" data-Maybe</a>
</div>
Visit this page to know operations you can do on your controls once they are modified by jQM: Form Plugin Methods. This reference is very useful if you want to enable/disable controls or refresh them with new values.
If you are using ASP.NET WebForms as is our case, you want to run these plugins every time your page is modified. If you are using ASP.NET UpdatePanels, then you can bind a function to the following event handler where you could modify your controls each time an UpdatePanel is updated:
Sys.WebForms.PageRequestManager.getInstance().add_pageLoaded(function()
// Add the jQuery Mobile code modifing controls here
Normally this job is done automatically by jQM, but since we are not using the controls inside a jQM page, we have to update the DOM manually after each postback.
In its current form, jQuery Mobile is not compatible with Internet Explorer. Depending on the version of IE, it is easier completely unusable or doesn’t look as good (rounded corner issues). In our context (point of sale), we ended up utilizing Google Chrome Frame for our IE users – at least for the time being. The jQM team appears to be working towards full IE support for their beta release.
In conclusion, we loved working with jQuery Mobile once we figured out how to utilize bits & pieces of it individually. Currently, jQM focuses on development for mobile devices (which is normal) but we would be thrilled if they made integration into existing projects simpler. As this is an open source project, we weren’t afraid to peek at the code to figure out why it wasn’t working the way we intended it to. Let’s hope the project keeps on improving both its modularity and the desktop-based functionality. Thank you to the jQuery Mobile team, continue the great work!

I went to another plastic surgeon and asked him if he could take out the implants, put in smaller ones and do a lift to make me a C cup. He said he could. He did not measure me and picked out 240cc saline implants. He did the surgery with a small moon shape lift on the upper half of my aereolas. They are the same size. Now he is saying he can't cut around them.
update:
He is saying that he can not do the cut because of blood supply to the nipple-- that the nipple will turn black and die. I want him to take out these current implants and replace them with the smallest possible (120cc) and do the lollipop lift he told me he was going to do originally. My second surgery is scheduled for TODAY at 1pm Eastern. Should I postpone the surgery and seek another opinion? He say he is double board certified plastic/reconstructive surgeon.
I canceled my appt. Can I get my money back? I can't afford a revision w/out a refund.Warrenbrook Golf Course, one of 5 Somerset County Park Commission Championship Golf Courses, has partnered with the NJ Water Supply Authority to participate in its River-Friendly Golf Course Program to help protect local waterways.
Through the River-Friendly program, participating golf course staffs work to attain specific goals and requirements for certification in the areas of Water Quality Management, Water Conservation Techniques, Wildlife and Habitat Enhancement, and Education and Outreach. All five of the Park Commission's golf courses are currently participating in the River-Friendly program.
"The actions taken to become River Friendly certified are important steps to protecting the quantity and quality of drinking water supplies and enhancing wildlife habitat,” explained Superintendent of Warrenbrook, Tammy Stephens. “This certification further solidifies the Park Commission's commitment to protecting the environment while providing the best conditions possible for the golfers."
She continued, “Being 'River-Friendly' helps to protect natural resources while preserving and restoring New Jersey's native landscape.” At Warrenbrook, the initiative has already more than doubled the acreage of ‘reduced mow’ zones that require less mowing and reduced chemical and maintenance needs. Staff also annually tracks and monitors chemical and fertilizer usage to assist staff in understanding the specific needs of the course.
Additional actions include the installation of blue bird and bat boxes throughout the property to increase native wildlife and the addition of educational signage to help highlight on the importance of natural areas..

This is what health care looks like for many of the folks in this corner of southwest Virginia. And it will keep looking like this, thanks to state lawmakers who could have helped their most desperate constituents but instead blocked, bickered and weaseled until Virginia forfeited billions in Medicaid expansion funds. The result: More than 400,000 people who would have qualified for Medicaid coverage will continue to go uninsured.
This was hard for some of the people gathered here to stomach. They wish they could afford to go to a real doctor's office to get their blood checked or their rashes examined rather than the cow stalls and tents of this free clinic. The Remote Area Medical clinic sets up here every year, with volunteers providing free dental, eye and medical care to those in need.
Its creator is Stan Brock, that guy us '70s kids saw on "Wild Kingdom" chasing cheetahs while Marlin Perkins narrated. Brock saw poverty and need all over the world but was struck by the desperation he saw in America.
So now he walks through the tent in his familiar khakis and perfect posture. "God Bless you, Stan Brock!" a woman in a wheelchair yells as he walks by. He nods and smiles.
RAM has become part of the culture here. The schedule is printed across the entire front page of the Clinch Valley Times, and parking signs direct the parade of cars that roll in at all hours, slicing the early morning country stillness with city-loud rush-hour traffic.
At the fairgrounds, the pre-dawn darkness is illuminated by hundreds of tiny, orange lights - burning cigarettes - like fireflies. The smokers double down, because once they get past the fence and through the cattle stalls, volunteers tell them that they can't smoke in the clinic. And each tent - with rows and rows of chairs, lights, dental drills and other medical paraphernalia - has a big sign outside reminding everyone "No Weapons."
"You going to RAM? You go around this bend, then over the hill," the window guy at the McDonald's in Wise said over and over. At 3 a.m., there was a backup at the drive-through because all the people were asking for directions.
"Just tell them to go straight," the frustrated night manager told the window guy.
Window guy, who is 23, said he was going to RAM on Saturday. "I need to get my top plate," he said, opening his mouth and running his studded tongue along the top row of gums. "They pulled all my top teeth out last year."
Window guy can't get more than 30 hours a week at McDonald's, so he can't get employer-paid health insurance. "I just wait all year for RAM. That's my health care."
Same goes for the 31-year-old father who sat under a tent's sign that read "FILLINGS." His two kids, 5 and 8, were sitting on his knees. They were getting three fillings between them.
Dad works in a coal mine, two miles underground. And his company doesn't give him insurance.
"It's because of Obama," he explained to me. "Obama is closing all the coal mines, so now the mines can't afford to offer us insurance."
President Barack Obama isn't popular here, despite the passage of the Affordable Care Act, which is designed to help the very people who flock to RAM.
Jim Huffman, 65, was a coal miner, trucker and farmer his whole life in Tazewell County. He walks with a cane, takes 27 medications every day and wears a pin in his trucker hat that says "Obama is doing the job of 3 men: Larry, Moe and Curly."
But he wishes Virginia had expanded Medicaid.
"I've fallen through just about every crack there is," he said. "At one point, I couldn't afford my medications. I dropped down to 169 pounds and spent 17 days in the hospital. But maybe that Medicaid expansion could've helped me, I don't know."
His former state senator, Philip Puckett, D-Russell, had been one of the Virginia Democrats in favor of expanding Medicaid. The legislature was deadlocked, and the debate was continuing. Then, out of the blue, Puckett resigned at a time when Republicans had arranged jobs for him and his daughter.
His betrayal handed Republicans the majority and stalled the effort to get more people insured. It also sparked an investigation by the feds.
Puckett's name came up a lot in those tents, which are pitched just a few miles from his district.
"Now gimme a minute, I'm going to censor myself here," Deborah Nagy, 60, explained as she prepared to tell me what she thought about her former senator.
"He was a downright polecat," she said. "Talk about being let down."
Nagy is one of about 21,000 in Puckett's former district who don't have insurance. She is a home health-care aide who makes too much for Medicaid and too little to pay for insurance herself through the Affordable Care Act.
"I'm another one who fell through the cracks," she said. "Maybe if that expansion passed, I wouldn't have to be here today."
By noon, the folks who got in line Thursday were being examined after a 26-hour wait. Eyes were being dilated, blood drawn and teeth pulled.
A politician showed up and started shaking hands with the soggy people huddled under a huge, yellow-and-white striped tent, waiting to have their eyes checked. He told them: "I am working to make sure you get health care all year, not just one day a year."
From the back row, Gilda Mountcastle, 54, a house cleaner from Keokee in Lee County, shouted: "We know Jesus. And we know Stan Brock. Who are you?"
"I'm the governor," Terry McAuliffe said.
Mountcastle later told me that she knew he was the governor - she was trying to put him on the spot. She demanded to know how he is going to fix the state of health care in Virginia.
"We are proud, hillbilly mountain folk," Mountcastle said. "We want to work hard. We don't want handouts or food stamps. But we want to be able to afford to take care of ourselves and our family."
"It's time to close the coverage gap," McAuliffe said, explaining that many of the folks at the fairgrounds this weekend are the very people who would have been helped by Medicaid expansion. He called it "the moral, social and financially responsible thing to do."
To stand in line for 30 hours to get medical care one day a year "is not how you do health care in this country," he said.
You've got that right. The tents, the livestock corral, the desperate, broken bodies. It is a shameful that Virginia has allowed partisanship and politics to stand in the way of caring for its people.

Shortly before economist Ben Brunnen presented a Manning Foundation paper on the virtues on road tolls, a few reporters caught up with city transportation GM Mac Logan to ask that perennial question: tolls? In Calgary? Really?
If you look at what’s going on in other parts of the world, I’m pretty convinced it will happen in Calgary. The question is when.
Logan, who’s led the way on projects like the Peace Bridge, airport tunnel and the oh-god-finally investment boost to snow clearing on roads, has that sort of blend reporters like — outspoken at times but also thoughtful. And who’s sometimes unafraid of pushing out ideas beyond where the talking points or the politicians are.
This is a worthwhile 11 1/2 minutes to listen to.
Some highlights from what he’s thinking about in the future of tolls:
– Not toll booths like on U.S. turnpikes or Halifax’s harbour bridges, or electronic gates like the Toronto-area 407 highway or Vancouver’s Port Mann Bridge.
– Logan envisions a future where wireless technology can track all the kilometres driven in a city, and charge on that basis.
– He views it as a potential offset to future property tax increases. Rather than make fixed-income seniors who don’t drive much pay through taxes for all the road plowing and pothole filling, why not put that cost on the user.
– The question he posed: When? When we put it back to him, he said the technology he fancies may be ready in 10 years or so. He’s got no idea whether council will go along for the.Argentina currency

. . .DE TRAFFORD 1997 VIN DE PAILLE
RELEASE OCTOBER 1998
This is the first wine to be released under the entirely
new category "Wine from Naturally
Dried Grapes", recently formed by the Wine and
Spirit Board specifically to accommodate this wine and others
to follow.
Vin de Paille is French for "straw
wine", a group of wines made from grapes dried
on straw mats. Described by British winewriter Jancis Robinson
as "... necessarily expensive, but often quite delicious,
long - lived sweet white wines ... Today, production of this
rarity is virtually confined to particularly ripe vintages
and the most conscientious producers of Hermitage, Arbois,
occasionally L'Etoile, and Cotes du Jura."
Other wines produced by various raisining techniques include
:
# "Vini Passiti" of Italy, including the Recioto
della Valpolicella / Amarone and Vin Santo of Tuscany. These
wines are made from grapes left to dry on racks or hanging
from rafters in airy loft spaces.
# "Strohwein" of Germany, similar in principle to
the "straw wines" of France.
# In various Mediterranean countries including Greece and
Cypress isolated examples are found. These are typically laid
out to dry in full sunshine on straw or plastic sheets.
Driven by the curiosity of these mysterious, unobtainable
wines, I decided to try something similar. In 1995
we produced a tiny experimental batch, which turned out to
be quite delicious. The 1996 vintage was not quite as rich
and the wine fermented to an amazing 16.6% alc. Although uncertified,
the wine was quickly sold out. These wines are still very
much in an experimental stage and are presented as an ongoing
process to develop a new wine style.
VINEYARD
The following is a description of the 1997
production :
Only top quality Chenin Blanc
grapes are used, mostly from a 25 year old block on a neighbouring
cool high altitude SW slope. The vines are unirrigated and
yielded 6 tons / hect. 1997 was a difficult growing season
with a lot of rain, particularly in our area, but the ripening
season was very cool and produced grapes of exceptional quality.
Harvest date: 7/3/97 - 27/3/97 @ 22 - 24° Balling.
PRODUCTION
The grapes were picked at optimum,
not over ripeness ( approx. 25
deg. balling ). They were laid out carefully on specially
constructed racks in partial shade ( 80% ) to slowly
shrivel over a 3 week period. The grape sugars, acids and
fruit flavours are naturally concentrated before reharvesting
in the cool morning. Due to the cool and wet weather at least
1/3 of the grapes had to be discarded before vinification.
The raisined grapes were crushed and pressed in a traditional
basket press and transferred by gravity directly to new
oak barrels. Barrel fermentation was completed using
natural yeasts only. The wine
matured for a little more than a year in 2/3 French, 1/3 American
new 225 litre oak barrels. Racked to remove heavy sediment
and lightly bentonite fined before being bottled unfiltered.
Matured for one year using 2/3 French, 1/3 American new 225
litre oak barrels.
Racked while in barrel to remove heavy sediment and lightly
bentonite fined before bottling unfiltered.
Bottling date : 25 / 5 / 98.
TASTING NOTES
Attractive deep yellow / light gold colour.
Intense honey, dried apricot, nutty fudge, spice and ripe
tropical fruit aromas.
The palate is almost overly rich and concentrated with a welcome
dryness from the acidity and oak tannins balancing the sweetness.
Wonderful with ice cream and other creamy desserts or simply
to enjoy after a meal. Definitely not a palate cleanser!

It’s always a concern, starting a crucial playoff series on the other team’s turf.
Nettleton took care of business in its Class 3A semifinal opener on Thursday night by scoring seven runs in the first inning and rolling to a 12-2 victory in six innings at Booneville.
The best-of-three series shifts to Nettleton on Saturday, with the first pitch in Game 2 at noon.
“We’re considered to have the homefield advantage, but I think it’s an advantage to start a series at home,” said Nettleton coach Chris Kidd. “We feel very good about coming up here and leaving with a victory.”
The Tigers had 11 hits to support pitcher Michele hester (23-0), including triples by Haley Parker, Makenzie Hawkins and Haydden Payne.
Hester, a junior, “does a real good job, always putting the ball in the strike zone for us,” Kidd said. “She doesn’t get a whole lot of strikeouts, but she does hit her spots.”
And the team fielded cleanly behind Hester, who tossed a four-hitter. “We’ve always been that way,” Kidd said. “We know that defense wins games.”
– Hatley 11, Eupora 8: The home team took care of business after falling behind 8-4 in the second inning. The series switches to Eupora on Saturday.
Baseball
– Amory 6, Lewisburg 5: Amory will head home with a one-game lead in the Class 4A North finals.
Game 2 is set for 7 p.m. tonight in Amory.
Trailing 5-1 with two outs in the fifth, senior catcher Zack Randolph walked with the bases loaded and Justin Rone was hit by a pitch to pull Amory (26-5) within 5-3. Will Cox then drove in three runs on a double against starter Aaron Smith to put Amory ahead for good.
“Coming from behind says a lot about our kids,” Amory coach Chad Williams said. “They didn’t give up. They had a prime opportunity to, but they did a great job rallying. What was really impressive is we had more fans there than they did.”
Freshman Tanner Poole singled to start the two-out rally.
In the bottom of fifth, Cox came on in relief of starter Drew Pickle and threw five pitches to get two fly outs with Lewisburg runners on first and third.
Lewisburg (26-7) had scored five fourth-inning runs. Randolph had a solo home run for Amory. Pickle (9-3) got the win for Amory.
– Myrtle 7, Smithville 6: Jimel Judon won it with a walkoff home run in the eighth inning, capping a wild comeback for the home team.
Myrtle (19-8) trailed 6-2 heading into the bottom of the seventh and scratched out four runs to tie it, with Justin Pickens tying it with his two-run, two-out single.
The teams play again tonight at Smithville.
Golf championships
– It’ll take some work today if Northeast Mississippi is going to add another state championship to the four golf titles already claimed this week.
Saltillo, the host team, is 20 strokes back in the Class 5A tournament at the Natchez Trace Golf Club. West Jones (320) is out front, closely trailed by Pearl River (325).
Andrew Spiers of Pearl River held the first-round individual lead with a 74. Ryan Blackwell of West Jones was at 75. Adam Hall of Saltillo was in a tie for eighth at 81.
Oxford (366) was in a tie for 10th place.
In the Class 1A tournament at Beau Pre in Natchez, Cathedral (331) is closely trailed by St. Aloysius (335). Thrasher (373) is third.
Austin Byrum of West Union and Chris Ingram of St. Aloysius shared the first-round lead at 74.There is a growing interest in the question how individual top performance is achieved. Research shows that the way individuals practice skills and the amount of practice they do largely explains differences between top performers and others. Below, two concepts of effective practice are explained: deliberate practice and deep practice.
Deliberate practice: Anders Ericsson’s body of work has demonstrated through research that building top expertise is more than a matter of raw talent a matter of long and repeated deliberate practice. Deliberate practice is an effortful activity designed to improve individual target performance and it consists of the following four elements: 1) It's designed specifically to improve performance, 2) It is repeated a lot, 3) Feedback on results is continuously available, 4) It's highly demanding mentally, and not necessarily. Top performance in a wide array of fields is always based on an extreme amount of deliberate practice. Researchers estimate that a minimum of 10000 hours is required. Also, to remain at the top, prolonged deliberate practice is required..
Deep practice: In his book The Talent Code, Daniel Coyle describes a way of effective practice which he calls ‘deep practice’. Deep practice is a way of attentive practicing which closely resembles deliberate practice (which Coyle acknowledges). What happens in the brain while deep practice is done is described in this post: Mastery through Myelin. A first step in deep practice is to look at the task at a whole. One way of doing this is to observe an experienced performer. A second step is to divide it into its smallest possible chunks (components) and practice and memorize these separately. Then, link them together in progressively larger groupings. A third step is to play with time, first slowing the action down and then speeding it up. Slowing down helps you to attend more closely to errors, creating a higher degree of precision. To build and retain skill continued deep practice is required with an optimal time investment of between three and five hours a day. In deep practice you pick a specific target (a part of the task you want to master), then you reach for it, you evaluate the gap between the target and the reach and to start again. Detecting mistakes is essential for making progress. This error-focused element of deep practice makes it a struggle, a process of stretching which is likely to be slightly dissatisfying or frustrating but which leads to growth.
While I am not completely convinced that Coyle’s description of effective practice deserves a separate name (deliberate practice would have done well, I think) his explanation is useful and interesting. His attention for chunking, error-focus, varying speed and repetition are thought provoking.- 1

Attorney Misconduct, Lawyer of the Day, Legal Ethics
Allen Feingold, a former Pennsylvania attorney, really loved practicing law. Even after being suspended and eventually disbarred, he continued to service clients — and went to extraordinary measures to do so.
From Gina Passarella of the Legal Intelligencer:
[Feingold] created letterhead in the name of attorney Jeffry Stephen Pearson, another attorney who apparently handled some of Feingold’s files once Feingold was suspended. Feingold would use that letterhead, unbeknown to Pearson, to file pleadings and legal correspondence to lawyers, clients and judges, according to the complaint. Once Pearson learned of this, he changed his password for electronic filings with the court, but Feingold learned of the new password and continued making filings under Pearson’s name, the ODC alleged in the complaint.
To put a stop to his misconduct, a judge ordered the Office of Disciplinary Counsel to lock Feingold out of his offices.
Pretty bad — but it gets worse….
Feingold’s August 2006 suspension was the result of a summer 2004 incident during which Feingold allegedly choked a 74-year-old judge pro tempore at the Philadelphia Dispute Resolution Center because he was unhappy with the judge’s arbitration ruling in a case he had been handling, according to the board’s report in that case….
Feingold admitted to attempting to strike the judge pro tem during the altercation.
“I figured hell, if I’m going to lose my license, at least let me get my one punch in,” Feingold testified during the ensuing disciplinary proceedings, according to the board’s report.
So, Mr. Feingold: Was it worth it?

Posted: January 19, 2011|
THE principal of one of Devon's biggest schools is recovering in hospital from serious injuries he suffered in a three-car crash.
Tony Alexander, 62, headteacher of Exmouth Community College, is believed to have sustained broken ribs and a punctured lung. He was travelling to Winchester on the A31 at Almer, between Dorchester and Christchurch, when his silver BMW coupe was hit head-on by a Renault Megane. A white Peugeot van then ran into the back of Mr Alexander's vehicle.
He and the 57-year-old male driver of the Megane, who comes from Wimborne in Dorset, were trapped in their vehicles and had to be cut free by Dorset firefighters.
Both casualties were then airlifted by air ambulance to Dorchester County Hospital with Mr Alexander's injuries initially described as serious.
His condition is now described as "stable".
Staff at the community college said they had been shocked to hear what had happened and were keeping in touch with the hospital to monitor Mr Alexander's progress.
His wife has been visiting him and it is not known how long he will be in hospital.
Joint deputy principals David Turner and Graham Allen are carrying out Mr Alexander's duties in his absence from school.
Elizabeth Lee, chairman of the governors, said: "I have spoken to Mr Alexander and he remains cheerful and has been asking about the school.
"His wife had phoned me to break the news of the accident and she is visiting him on a regular basis.
"He is progressing well and in good spirits. We will keep people informed over the next few days of any further news. Mr Allen and Mr Turner will oversee the running of the college until Mr Alexander's return."
Mrs Lee stressed it was "business as usual" at the school.
"We have good systems in place among the senior management team and all the staff send him their best wishes," she said. "We are due to visit him in hospital but, knowing him, he will be itching to get back to school."
A spokesman for Dorset police said the accident happened at 2.45pm last Friday.
Mr Alexander was driving home for the weekend. He stays in Exmouth, due to his work, during weekdays.
The spokesman said: "The two drivers sustained serious injuries and they were cut free from their vehicles by firemen.
"The van driver, from Plymouth, was shocked but otherwise unhurt in the accident."
Police closed the road for three hours and set up diversions while the vehicles' occupants were rescued and wreckage cleared from the highway.
The spokesman said an appeal for witnesses had been made.

Bio
Perry the Platypus, codenamed Agent P, is Phineas and Ferb's pet platypus. Unknown to his owners, he lives a double life as a secret agent for the O.W.C.A. (The Organization Without a Cool Acronym) a.k.a. "The Agency". The Agency is a government organization of animal spies. In the Agency, his immediate superior is Major Monogram. He is assigned to thwart the plans of the self-proclaimed "evil" Dr. Heinz Doofenschmirtz. They are best described as frenemies-sometimes helping each other, other times they're bitter enemies.
Perry was adopted at an animal shelter run by the O.W.C.A. by the Flynn-Fletcher Family. According to Phineas, Perry was chosen because he looked at both Phineas and Ferb at the same time. When they adopted the platypus, he was given the name "Bartholomew" before he was renamed "Perry".
Perry is normally found acting like a mindless platypus in front of his owners, Phineas and Ferb. He is also serious while not undercover, even in front of Major Monogram. Perry also deeply cares about the Flynn-Fletcher family and is afraid to lose them and would take immediate action whenever they are threatened.

Education can change a girl’s life and that of her family, community and society at large. If all women had a primary and secondary education, child marriages and child mortality could fall by 49% and 64% respectively. With just primary education for all women, maternal deaths could be reduced by two-thirds.
To reap these benefits, girls have to stay in school long enough, at least through lower secondary. This is not happening: girls are far less likely than boys to complete primary school, with only 60% of countries achieving parity in primary education and only 38% of countries achieving parity in secondary education. In low-income countries, only 20% have achieved gender parity at the primary level and 10% at the lower secondary level.
These findings are highlighted in UNESCO’s Gender Summary, which analyses data from the 11th annual Education for All Global Monitoring Report. Released in partnership with the United Nations Girls Education Initiative (UNGEI) on International Women’s Day; the Gender Summary calls for girls’ education to be at the forefront of new global education goals after 2015.
UNESCO Director-General Irina Bokova said partnerships will be catalytic in overcoming the obstacles to girls’ and women’s education, which include poverty, distance from school, unsafe learning environments and lack of trained female teachers.
“The gender gap in education is completely unacceptable, not just for individuals but for the whole of society. We must work together; international organizations, stakeholders, governments, civil society, and the private sector, to overcome this rampant discrimination and exclusion,” said Ms Bokova.
The upcoming 2014 Global Education and Skills Forum jointly hosted by the Government of the United Arab Emirates, UNESCO, and GEMS Education, Varkey GEMS Foundation and Dubai Cares, in support of the United Nations Secretary-General’s Global Education First Initiative, is focusing on public-private partnerships in addressing the urgent educational needs of all learners, particularly the most marginalized.
As part of the Forum, held from March 15 – 17 in Dubai, UNESCO Director-General, Irina Bokova,.”

Permanent Representative of Japan to the United Nations
Open Debate on the Situation in the Middle East
26 July, 2011
Mr. President,
I would like to thank the President for giving us the opportunity to address the situation in the Middle East. I thank Mr. Serry for his comprehensive briefing. I would also like to thank Ambassador Mansour and Ambassador Prosor for their respective statements.
Japan strongly supports a two-State solution, under which Israel and a Palestinian State live side by side in peace, security and mutual recognition. Japan supports the vision that the borders under a two-State solution should be defined through negotiations, based on the 1967 lines, with mutually agreed swaps, in a way that will achieve peaceful co-existence of a viable Palestinian state and Israel with secure and recognized borders. Through such a two-State solution, the Palestinians will exercise their rights to establish an independent state, Israel will enjoy a greatly enhanced security environment, and both parties will be able to launch full-fledged cooperation for mutual prosperity.
A two-State solution can only be achieved through sincere negotiations. Japan has been encouraging both sides to resume direct negotiations in cooperation with the international community. Japan strongly supports President Obama’s speech in May which laid out a foundation for resuming negotiations.
We call on both sides to engage with the United States and the international community and to take steps that will create an environment conducive to restarting direct negotiations.
Japan does not recognize any unilateral measures that prejudge the outcome of the final status negotiations. The two parties must abide by their obligations under previous agreements, most importantly the Road Map. We call on Israel again to freeze its settlement activities in the West Bank including East Jerusalem. At the same time, we call upon the Palestinian Authority to continue its efforts to improve security and fulfill its commitments to cease violence and work against incitement.
Japan has been strongly supporting the State-building efforts of the Palestinian Authority and will continue to provide assistance in that regard.
Japan remains concerned about the humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip. We continue to call for the full implementation of resolution 1860. Japan is keenly monitoring the Palestinian efforts to establish a unified government that will genuinely seek a two-State solution.
In conclusion, I would like to reiterate our call to the parties to make the utmost effort to resume direct negotiations. Japan, along with the international community, will continue to make efforts to help realize a just and comprehensive peace in the region.
Thank you very much.This week the animated adventure, EPIC, hits AMC theatres everywhere and we have a fantastic prize pack to share with you.

Since launching four months ago, EE has rolled out its 4G network to 37 towns and cities, which as of Thursday include Barnsley, Chorley, Coventry, Newport, Preston, Rotherham, Telford, Walsall and Watford.
The network provider plans to cover 98 percent of the population by the end of 2014 and expects to reach 50 percent June, delivering estimated mobile speeds of between 8 to 12 Mbps.
"We're committed to making the UK's first 4G service available to as many people, as quickly as possible," Olaf Swantee, EE chief executive, said in a statement.
EE began rolling out its 4G ahead of the UK's auction for 4G LTE-designated portions of the 1800MHz and 2.6GHz frequencies, which finally kicked off in January this year.
EE bid for a slice of the spectrum alongside Hutchinson 3G UK (Three), Telefonica UK (O2), and Vodafone, as well as BT subsidiary called Niche Spectrum Ventures, HKT UK (a subsidiary of Hong Kong telco PCCW), and MLL Telecom.
The next 35 towns on EE's schedule to be completed by June are company said it is also building additional 4G towers in existing locations to boost the network's capacity.

Topic Last Modified: 2006-07-13
Having one or more subsystems that are underperforming alters the responses and behaviors of a server. Usually, this means that the server becomes unresponsive or falls below what is considered acceptable operational behavior. This diminished performance puts the service level agreement (SLA) at risk, which ultimately means the organization itself can suffer.
These topics provide administrators of Microsoft® Exchange Server 2003 with information about how to isolate performance degradations and how to use existing tools and products, such as Performance, Load Simulator, Exchange Stress and Performance 2003, Network Monitor, and Filemon, for this purpose. The information in these topics can also be used to ensure that a server is not degrading over time because of hardware issues or malfunctions.
Note that it is beyond the scope of these topics to ensure that a server is healthy, or to diagnose or solve user experience problems. Although performance issues with the server generally translate to a poor user experience (such as slow client response), this is not always true and the reverse does not necessarily hold. Before concluding that a poor user experience results from a poorly performing server, it is important to correlate the user issues with observed degradations on the server.970 Meridian Ave APT 77, San Jose, CA 95126: 171 all time views

Location and Hours, Map and DirectionsI first want to say that I am enjoying the updates to the Master Technician series. Thank you for your vigilance in making this a current resource. Next, my question. With the change in the labeling for synthetic pyrethroids I need to confirm or maybe update my understanding of spot treatments. I have a long history in the industry and in the past I believe it was acceptable to string spot applications side-by-side together, relying on an accepted not-to-exceed percentage of a given surface of the application. At this point, I have a concern with the validity of the spot treatment percentage issue and the demands of the new labeling. Specifically, the limitations for use around the exterior of the home at windows and doorways. My question is this: Is it currently considered a compliant application if spot treatments are attached side-by-side as long as the areas of the spots combined does not exceed a certain percentage of the given surface? Thank you for your input on this concern.
Good morning Eddie, and thank you for the compliments. I see you are in Colorado, so I hope you and your home are safe from the awful fires..'Likes' are shared on Facebook and Audible.com. We use your 'likes' to improve Audible.com for all our listeners.

"Goes well with another book"
This book is a very good technical complement to "How To Win Friends and Inflence People".I recommend listening to the above book before this one. That way, you will have the tools to apply correctly the theory in this book.I really liked the structure, the flow and the content of this audiobook. It talks about the cycle of a "No" and how to turn a negative "No" into a positive "No". The author gives us the tools and shows us how to recognize and act apropriately when a negative "No" is present.City voters disappoint progressives---again
Challenging the myth that SF voters are left-wing, Chronicle reporter Heather Knight lists the recent issues that show city voters are more moderate: two years ago they rejected public power, rejected legalizing prostitution, and kept JROTC in city schools. Last Tuesday city voters passed the sit-lie measure, voted to make Muni drivers negotiate their contracts like everyone else, and again rejected allowing non-citizens to vote in school board elections. Knight talked to former supervisor Aaron Peskin, who provides a muddled, "progressive" analysis of recent elections:
Aaron Peskin, chair of the city's Democratic County Central Committee, said measures like the sit/lie ban are clear attempts by downtown groups to motivate moderate voters in the hopes they'll elect moderate members of the Board of Supervisors. While it was too early to call the supervisors races, Peskin said it looked like the effort had failed. Progressives were leading in three of the four open races. That happened two years ago too when voters trended moderate on measures, but elected four liberal supervisors.
Of course city voters are more moderate on ballot measures than they are in electing supervisors because of district elections. Liberal districts elect people to the Board of Supervisors who would have a hard time winning a citywide election, including Chris Daly, Ross Mirkarimi, and even Peskin himself.
Sit-lie had nothing to do with electing supervisors. Like Care Not Cash in 2002---another big defeat for city progressives---the sit-lie measure was designed to address what a majority of city voters clearly think is a serious street punk problem in the neighborhoods. Whenever city progressives lose on a ballot measure, they invoke the wicked, shadowy, "downtown" groups as an explanation. To hear them tell it, they never lose a vote on the merits of an issue.
Peskin makes a disingenuous claim about why important city issues often have to be settled by city voters with ballot measures:
He[Peskin] said the larger lesson is that there are simply too many measures placed on the ballot by politicians who should deal with the issues themselves. "The people of San Francisco would benefit from shorter ballots, and the vast majority of these initiatives should be vetted in the political process without being put before the voters," he said.
Peskin knows that the sit-lie measure was put on the ballot by Mayor Newsom because progressives on the Board of Supervisors refused to do so. Instead, the supervisors (Avalos, Campos, Chiu, Daly, Mar, Maxwell, and Mirkarimi) put Proposition M on the ballot to counter Proposition L, the mayor's sit-lie measure. City voters weren't fooled, and they passed Prop. L and rejected Prop. M.
Something similar happened with Gavin Newsom's Care Not Cash back in 2002. Newsom had to get the measure on the ballot by gathering signatures, while progressive supervisors (Ammiano, Gonzalez, McGoldrick, and Peskin) put poison pill Prop. O on the ballot to counter Prop. N, Care Not Cash. The outcome was similar: city voters, concerned about homelessness and the growing squalor on city streets, passed Prop. N and rejected Prop. O.
Knight also talks to so-called homeless advocates, who continue to conflate homelessness and the sit-lie issue:
Jennifer Friedenbach, director of the Coalition on Homelessness, said her group will likely join others to file a lawsuit against the measure on the ground it levies too steep a punishment (up to $500 and 30 days in jail for repeat offenders) and will be applied by police selectively. "People get frustrated, and they see homeless people and they look for quick solutions," she said. "Unfortunately, we're kind of doing the same thing over and over and over again. It's proven not to work."
The reality is that the street punk problem addressed by the sit-lie measure is not about homelessness at all, and Care Not Cash has had some real success in dealing with homelessness over the years, as both the Grand Jury and the Controller concluded a couple of years ago.
But Paul Boden takes the prize for his succinct statement of the delusional progressive interpretation of sit-lie and homelessness:
Paul Boden, director of the Western Regional Advocacy Project, agreed[with Friedenbach], saying "The closer poverty is to your face, the less liberal people tend to be. They see the righteous peasant in El Salvador, but it's a bum when it's the person in your doorway, and politicians play off that constantly."
Next time you see a street punk panhandling on Haight Street for money to get drunk/high, try not to laugh when you compare him to "the righteous peasant in El Salvador."

10 Comments:. We have a lot of ex-pats from the UK/France/etc... in our city who don't have a voice in the school board. And frankly - if they could have voted, we might have gotten rid of Kim Shree-Maufus on Tuesday. Note that you really are only going to get legal immigrants with children voting in said election, and after that you will overlay traditional voter turnout on top of that - which basically means you are going to get extra votes from rich Europeans and Asians.
Wiener is not a progressive by befuddled San Francisco standards. Peskin probably considers Pelosi a moderate - the rest of the nation seems to think she's the reincarnation of Karl Marx. She endorsed Wiener. He's going to be very good for the city - top to bottom. I don't think he'll be any more or less "progressive" than Dufty - just a hell of a lot more decisive. Thank God for that.
Can't wait for the sit-lie law to take effect..and I hope it's rigorously enforced. Maybe now we can walk down Haight st, or Castro without being harassed by these lazy ass punks.
Scott Weiner will make a great supervisor! Congrats!
Who really voted for sit/lie?
."
I'm a Democrat and a liberal, more or less, who thinks voting in US elections should be restricted to American citizens. Let immigrants go through the citizenship process if they want to vote in the US. Peskin may think Pelosi is a mere "moderate," but she got nearly 80% of the vote from her constituents, which makes Peskin out of synch with city voters. But that's not news. After all the DCCC opposed sit-lie, endorsed legalizing prostitution and getting JROTC out of city schools. As a Democrat, I'll take Pelosi's brand of moderation over Peskin's leftist ideology any day.
Who voted for sit lie? 132,366 city voters, which was 54.71% of the votes cast. It was even kind of close in the heart of Progressive Land. When you look at the four precincts adjacent to upper Haight Street, sit-lie lost only 624 to 516, not exactly a landslide. Maybe all 516 of those folks were rich people? The vote on sit-lie just demonstrates once again that city voters are more conservative/moderate than the Bay Guardian-type lefties like to think.
The thinking on the school board issue is sort of ridiculous. 2/3rd of US Citizens have no children of school age, but they vote for the school board, and people with multiple kids in school cannot. The net result is people without a vested interest in the outcome - and thus don't research the choices - get to vote while people who care dearly about the outcome cannot. So we get... Kim Shree-Maufus.
The school board sets policy but has no capability to tax - non-citizens would not get a voice in setting taxation policy.
I don't see it any differently than a stockholder in Apple getting to vote in shareholder elections.
"I don't see it any differently than a stockholder in Apple getting to vote in shareholder elections."
Citizenship is not required to be a stockholder in Apple. Most of us think being a citizen of the US is something special that you have to go through a process to achieve. If you're not a citizen, you can still go talk to the kid's teacher, help him/her with homework, clean erasers, give him a blow job, whatever. But you can't vote in an election in SF without being a citizen. If voting in school board elections is so important, take your kid back to East Jesustan or wherever you are a legal resident and vote.
Progressives don't think being an American is important, since we are the Great Satan, oppressing poor people of different nationalities and religions, etc. Maybe city progs should go to some other countries and try to vote in their elections.
Then why do we let them enroll their kids in the school?
Because the city's obligation to educate its children has nothing to do with their parents' immigration status.
Times change. You used to have to be a natural born US citizen to be President, not anymore. Why not let them vote.
Are you saying that Obama wasn't born in the US? Take a look at the evidence to the contrary.
SF progressives don't value US citizenship in the first place, which is why they don't mind degrading its currency by allowing non-citizens to vote in our elections.

The earliest recorded diabetic diet is in the Papyrus Ebers,
which was written in about 1500 B.C. Those ancient physicians
advocated wheat grains, fruit, and sweet beer-in other words,
a high-carbohydrate diet - "to drive away the passing of too
much urine." Most recorded diets over the next millennium
were rich in carbohydrates. Then in the late 1700's, Dr. John
Rollo, a British physician, came up with a radically different
plan: a low-carbohydrate diet high in fat and animal protein.
The diet, built on "blood pudding and old rancid meats,"
probably was low in calories, too, because of its extreme
unpalatability.
Variations of low-carbohydrate, low-calorie diets were
advocated for the next 150 years or so, with a few
notable exceptions, such as one that was mostly oatmeal.
In the 1850's, a Paris physician suggested a diet of 125 grams
of sugar candy and two portions of meat. Several of these
early doctors noted that periodic fasting or calorie restriction
seemed to help. In 1912, Dr. Fredrick M. Allen of New York's
Rockefeller Institute devised a near-starvation diet of 1,000
calories a day. Such low-calorie regimens, even though they
did not allow for proper growth and resulted in extreme emaciation,
may have prolonged life for a few Type I diabetics. Still,
without insulin, the diabetes would grow progressively worse
and the person would die.
All of this changed dramatically after two Canadian researchers,
doctors. Frederick Banting and Charles Best, discovered insulin in 1921.
A 13-year-old boy, Leonard Thompson, was the first patient to
receive the hormone injections. He was treated with regular
insulin injections for five months, and with normal blood-sugar
levels, the boy was released from the hospital as cured. He was
back a few months later, weighing only 60 pounds and again near death.
This time, it was recognized that the injections would not provide
a cure but that he could manage quite well so long as he received
them daily. His diet was high in fats, moderate in protein, and
relatively low in carbohydrates. Under this regimen, the boy
began to grow and, until his death from pneumonia in 1935, he
led a relatively normal life.
Since then, a great deal has been learned about insulin dosages and
diabetes control, and over the last 50 years dietary recommendations
have been revised several times. Even though insulin injections are
not as precise as the body's own system of secreting the hormone
in response to need, we have learned a good deal about the fine
tuning of insulin dosages and matching the hormone to food intake,
exercise, and other variable factors. Today's diabetes specialists
and patient educators also recognize that "there is no single,
specific food plan suitable for all individuals with diabetes."
Recently, the American Diabetes Association has modified its
nutritional recommendations. This includes the role of selected
vitamins and minerals and guidelines for food labeling.

He now appears as a world historian, one of that rare breed who find the time, in the middle of a working life, to sit back and take stock of the labors and triumphs of man, and to point out the dangers and challenges that lie ahead.
In his preface, Thomas explains that this history must be unfinished, incomplete, as the possibilities and hopes of the future are not yet entirely foreclosed. It must also be incomplete in the more general sense that no individual can treat all aspects of human social life, no matter how diligent he may be or how many volumes he may write. For this reason it is odd that the American publisher should have made a change in the title of the original British edition: An Unfinished History of the World.
The interpretative scheme adopted by Thomas, also described briefly in his preface, involves an emphasis on the history of technology and “culture” in the widest sense—human habits, forms of organization, the history of nutrition, of medicine and sanitation, and only secondarily of the intellect. Furthermore, the greatest attention is paid to modernity—to the period from about 1750 onward. Thus, without being too explicit about it, Thomas lays his work squarely in the tradition that sees world history as the “rise of the West” (as in the famous work of that title by the Chicago historian William McNeill, first published in 1963 and in preparation for thirty years prior to that).
_____________
Thomas is not a Hegel or a Jacob Burckhardt; he does not offer a philosophical “justification” of what happened in history by referring to the mysterious operations of a “world spirit.” Nor is he a cultural pessimist, cataloguing the decline of a once-glorious movement into the vulgarities of mass society. His work is, primarily, a fascinating catalogue of inventions, ideas, developments, habits, and forms of organization, the massive paraphernalia of human social existence which make up what one might call the framework of history, the tools that make things work. As such it may be seen as an Anglo-Saxon attempt at the sort of “total history” associated with the work of the French historian Fernand Braudel (whose The Mediterranean and Capitalism and Material Life 1400-1700 appear in Thomas’s bibliography and are relatively frequently quoted). Braudel speaks of such factors as climate, travel, and trade, the administration of cities and states, crops, droughts, and epidemics. His approach is learned and laborious. Thomas has succeeded very well in transferring this “total” approach to history to the easier, more open and accessible Anglo-Saxon mode, in which world history for a general audience becomes more than a selection of fashionable platitudes (of whatever variety), but less daunting than the learned apparatus of a Braudel or his disciples.
The comparison with Braudel and his school breaks down, however, as soon as one reaches the question of the normative or interpretative. The danger of the strict Braudel method is that while pretending to be value-free and objective, it in fact implicitly asserts the priority of material conditions (if in a non-Marxist sense). Thomas never claims to follow any methodological rules to the exclusion of any others. His criterion is simply one of interest and general significance. No one would quarrel with the judgment that the history of communications is vital to an understanding of the modern world; Thomas therefore sensibly includes two chapters on the subject. At the same time, a normative element undoubtedly emerges, particularly in the last chapters, with such titles as “The Democratic Alternative”; “Democracy: Internal Anxieties”; and “Causes of the Cold War: Notions of Imperialism.”
_____________
The targets of Thomas’s criticism are easy to detect: they are, first of all, Marxist demands for revolution and the overthrow of “bourgeois” democracy, whether in South America or in Europe; and, secondly, the generalized beliefs that the West is evil and its past dominance and present preeminence unjustified. Thomas does not seek to gloss over the costs of Western progress, but he constantly asserts that progress was, and is, not only possible but real.
Thomas might very well have been more vehement on this subject. He might, and with some justification, have presented a political tract on behalf of the “new Conservatism” of Margaret Thatcher, especially as he is now a member of the London think-tank (the Center for Policy Studies), which harbors Mrs. Thatcher’s redoubtable, if not always consistent, Industry Secretary, Sir Keith Joseph. At the Center’s 1978 conference, Thomas gave a paper entitled “History, Capitalism, and Freedom,” in which he rehearsed Friedrich Hayek’s and Milton Friedman’s argument that the free-market economy, despite its alleged “immoralism,” ultimately provides a greater degree of liberty and more life chances than any centralized system designed to further the “common good.” The cultural version of this view, namely, that capitalist democracy also provides the best guarantee for freedom of conscience and expression and for civilized political activity, was presented eloquently by Paul Johnson in his The Enemies of Society (1977). Johnson, like Thomas, is a disillusioned Labor intellectual, a social democrat who finds intolerable the current rhetoric of envy and hatred, of fear and violence, which controls the Labor party today.
_____________
For Thomas, the core of the 20th century’s problems is that the technical and material progress of the late 18th and 19th centuries was not followed by the development of an industrial world culture united by a common interest in liberty and democracy. Instead, the very technical opportunities that gave mankind such hope have been used to extend the powers of coercion and oppression far beyond the wildest imaginings of any ancient emperor or tyrant. “In the late 1970’s, it seemed possible that Western civilization might collapse before the end of the century, either from the onslaught of irrationality without or the failure of nerve within.” This is, indeed, the crucial problem of the post-modern era, and one not foreseen at all by Marx or any other of the economic theorists of capitalism. Rather, one finds insight into it in the social criticism of Tocqueville (often quoted by Thomas), in the understanding that, in the absence of religion or other strong social cohesive factors, mass society will inevitably become homogenized, latently coercive, and profoundly hostile to individual excellence.
It seems that the psychological root of this distrust of excellence, which often masquerades as a concern for equality, is the belief that achievement by individuals will inevitably be used to oppress others unless some ideology or an external coercive power prevents it. And that belief is in turn related to the anonymity of mass democratic society: if I know personally the people who exercise control over the conditions of my life, it is some-how easier to accept setbacks and problems than if such difficulties can be attributed only to faceless “market forces.” This is the basis of the sentimental and emotional radical critique of the market and the belief in the need for either a strong external state or a powerful inner censor to prevent the perilous eruption of individual spontaneity and talent.
Tocqueville understood this as few since him have done; indeed, it is hard to think of any critiques of radicalism which take up this argument (one exception is the French “new philosopher,” Bernard-Henri Lévy). Thomas does not drive very deep here, either; it is one weakness of his superb and impressive account that he simply records the unpleasant facts—the rise of totalitarianism, the extension of state power, mass psychoses, the “failure of nerve” of liberalism—in a way which does not relate them to one another or provide a historical explanation of their genesis.
Perhaps one should not blame Thomas for leaving the dimension of morals and motivation out of his work; it would have made it twice as massive and would have detracted from the thrust and vigor of his account as it stands. For Thomas, the values of the West are self-transparent and self-motivating. Who can doubt that the industrial organization of production is best for all, or that individual liberty and a fair measure of social equality are self-justifying goals which are best guaranteed in Western society? But the problem here is that the majority of the world’s people live under systems of government and of economic organization which, implicitly or explicitly, do deny these assumptions, and this denial must be explained.
The closest Thomas comes to acknowledging the vipers’ nest of problems and dilemmas at which I have hinted is in his epilogue, where he attributes a large measure of the irrationality of totalitarian governments to a false understanding of history. With the decline of religious standards of judgment, appeals to “history” have become the main justification for unpleasant actions by government. But if this is so, says Thomas, then a truer understanding of history will help us undermine these appeals. This is not question-begging—in practical terms, and without having to enter into laborious discussions of how one validates historical accounts, no sane person would doubt, for example, that Thomas’s world history is far truer than that of Joseph Stalin. One way to test the truth of history is in terms of its subject—is it true to what it describes, does it respect and understand the inner logic of its material, whether it be a life, the history of a war, a government, or an institution? Such a notion of truthfulness entails an open commitment to understand the workings of reality, of other people, of groups, political cultures and systems, and entire civilizations. And that is not an impossible enterprise in our era of freely available information and interpretations.
_____________
Thomas has done a great job of presenting innumerable more or less well-known facts and bits of information about “the works of man.” The next task for a world history must be to relate all this to the inner workings of cultures and individuals which alone “make sense” of the facts and show us what man is capable of, in both the good and the bad sense.Men, women and children suffer during the humanitarian crisis in Sudan hardships know no gender or age.

CAny time government leaders award tax breaks, they first must be sure the breaks are warranted.
The Port Huron City Council voted unanimously to approve them for Mueller Brass and downtown loft developer Steve Witt. In both cases, the abatements are examples of sound public policy.
Mueller Brass has a long history as a Port Huron manufacturer. The six-year personal property tax exemption is an investment in the city's future.
The challenge Mueller Brass faces is to compete in the global market. Company officials plan to spend more than $18 million on new machinery.
With it, the Port Huron facility would become a leading example of brass rod production. That's something the Blue Water Area should applaud.
Too often, rust-belt manufacturers opt to close their doors in the face of strong foreign competition. Mueller Brass is willing to fight.
The company's stance is a tribute to the nearly 250 people it employs and a signal of hope to Port Huron and St. Clair County. These communities have seen far more than their share of factories that fell victim to economic downturns. It's about time to see a local manufacturer step up to the global economy the way Mueller Brass plans to do.
The company deserves the abatement, and the same can be said for Witt's request for a Brownfield Plan, a tax break to people who renovate old buildings.
Witt wants to convert downtown Port Huron's Ben's Fine Furniture building into 11 lofts. The first floor would remain home to the furniture store.
The Witt family has done much for downtown. Thanks to the Witts, the central business district has 26 lofts, the kind of housing experts praise as critical to downtown's revival.
Port Huron residents should be grateful for the Witts' commitment to providing more people with the opportunity to live downtown. It is a vision the family has pursued without asking for any form of government assistance until now.
Downtown Port Huron has improved substantially. The Witts are part of its renaissance.
The council was right to grant the Witts' request. The tax abatement is a modest contribution to the family's commendable efforts.
Tax abatements never should be doled out freely. Mueller Brass and the Witts unquestionably proved they deserve them.
The tax breaks are wise investments in Port Huron's future.Hosting an anniversary dinner for around 20 guests. Looking for something nice in areas of Beverly Hills, Mid-city or Santa Monica. Thanks in advance for your suggestions.

The New York City Council voted to approve the Tobacco 21 Bill on Wednesday. This means that the minimum age to purchase tobacco products, including e-cigarettes, will now be 21, the same as the age to purchase alcohol. This is just one more step taken by city government, and particlarly by Michael Bloomberg, to create legislation that would make residents of New York make healthier choices. One such example was a vote that Bloomberg brought to the forefront to ban sugar-laden drinks that were larger than sixteen ounces. However, that law was repealed shortly afterward by the Supreme Court.
What Mayor Michael Bloomberg seems to be doing is taking away the freedom to choose and many New Yorkers are not happy about it. Some are upset because 18 is the age when a person legally becomes an adult and the opinion of some is that it infringes upon their rights. “You’re an adult; you should be able to buy a pack of cigarettes,” a New York resident told a CNN affiliate. What Mayor Bloomberg appears to be doing is taking away those choices for New Yorkers, including going so far as to regulate the amount of sugar they are allowed to order in a restaurant, although that particular law was overturned.
Of course, Bloomberg and the City Council see it differently. By implementing the Tobacco 21 bill, they claim that they are preventing many from starting smoking in the first place. New York is not the only city to see it this way either, although they are now the largest city with a tobacco age change. In 2005, a town in Massuchusetts enacted the same law and some of the surrounding towns around New York have raised the tobacco age from 18 to 19.
“By increasing the smoking age to 21, we will help prevent another generation from the ill health and shorter life expectancy that comes with smoking,” Bloomberg said on Wednesday. He now has 30 days to sign the bill into law, and he is almost certain to do so. While his intentions may be good, it is making some New Yorkers wonder what will be next.

Florence — Violence against children crosses social, economic and cultural lines, affecting millions of children worldwide. In an effort to address this issue and provide solutions, UNICEF's Office of Research reached out to experts globally and gathered more than 100 years of expertise into a video debate focusing on the plight of violence against children.
The Debate - which goes live on the International Day of Non Violence (2 October) - explores some of the strategic and operational challenges related to prevention of violence and addressing its underlying drivers.
Given the hidden nature of the issue, data about violence against children is difficult to collect. However, it is estimated that about 20 per cent of women and up to 10 per cent of men report being sexually abused as a child.
Amongst the topics highlighted in the Debate highlights are the role of civil society, government accountability, gender-based violence and HIV, and the urgency to invest in services and prevention, among other topics.
The expert panel includes Ms Amie Kandeh, a leading voice on violence in Sierra Leone; Mr Oswaldo Montoya, Global Coordinator of the MenEngage Alliance; Ms Nduku Kilonzo, Executive Director of Liverpool VCT; and Ms Diane Swales, UNICEF's Child Protection Advisor for East Asia and the Pacific Region.
The Debate is supported by some 15 written 'Commentaries' from experts such as Dr Alex Butchart, from the World Health Organization, and Jim Mercy, from the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, covering areas including: programmatic and research challenges, the importance of helplines, merging approaches to women and children and HIV and violence considering sexual, physical and emotional violence issues.

Yet another spurious study which supposedly attributes the adoption of Conservative political beliefs to bad biology.
The authors of the study insist that those inclined to adopt Liberal attitudes have brains more inclined to understand complexity, while the brains of Conservatives insist on feeling fear and anxiety.
But that doesn’t explain why Liberals can’t seem to avoid getting it wrong all the time. Shouldn’t their atomic-powered intellects clue them in that their most cherished policies are unworkable?
At least we have proof that brain damage is behind the reason why Liberals refuse to see reality.

Ah, so now these mush head scientists discern a brain difference between political positions, eh?
And the other day I saw a study of 47,000 European ancestry Americans with a caffeine gene.
And yet, on one of the most fundamental realities of humankind — gay or straight — there is this deep insistence that there is no genetic nothing. No natural anything.
This cannot be true. If we’re genetically drunks, or conservatives, or caffeine freaks, it’s impossible that we’re not gene-based gays. Impossible.
Astoundingly, only some less than 3,000 people — most straight surprisingly, have been examined in sixty years on the gay thing, with nary the ferocity of looking for conservative, alcoholic and caffeine genes. Yet none of these are truly serious, while a gay gene(s) impact the lives and sacred honor of millions of people worldwide. It’s time to do something about that. Don’t worry, gays pay more than enough in taxes to cover the costs.
It’s time for a National Commission on Gay Americans, to sort us out. Don’t Tread On Us Either. That’s my motto.

That is an interesting comment, Jim.

You are proving the point rather well. A well of irony is what this place is.
April 12th, 2011 at 6:23 am
A prevalence of gayness may not be a genetic anomaly of the individual but rather a social adaptation that is a response to overcrowding (ie city life). Or, maybe, it is a latent genetic adaptation that is triggered more frequently in individuals in response to the stimulus. Studies have been done with other mammals in larger and smaller cages….that tend to confirm.

“…insist that those inclined to adopt Liberal attitudes have brains more inclined to understand complexity…”
And yet almost every engineer I know is more conservative than liberal. Makes one wonder what type of complexity this study was looking for. Or maybe that innate fear and anxiety in engineers is what keeps the planes from falling from the sky frequently.

Dietrich Doerner, in his studies of decision-making, ran a simulation game in which subjects were put in charge of a third-world country with a model involving complex interactions: land use, water supplies, time delays between cause and effect, etc.
Many subjects in this simulation showed obsessive behavior–they would focus on one aspect, such as building irrigation canals, and ignore everything else, without even really trying to understand the interactions.
Doerner wanted to know what kinds of previous experience would help most in this game, so he ran it once with a set of college students for subjects, and again with a set of experienced business executives. The students had probably been more exposed to concepts of “ecological thinking”–but the executives did significantly better. This argues that there are forms of “tacit knowledge” which are gained as a result of decision-making experience, and which are transferable to at least some degree across subject matter domains.
The Logic of Failure

David, what in the world does that have to do with what was said in my original post?
April 12th, 2011 at 12:17 pm
The authors of the study insist that those inclined to adopt Liberal attitudes have brains more inclined to understand complexity, while the brains of Conservatives insist on feeling fear and anxiety.
Liberalism – that is, the leftist Utopian vision – is rooted in fear and anxiety, as well as a lot of wishful thinking. And it’s very bad at math, as the Democrats’ history on spending illustrates.
Where in the hell does that “liberals understand complexity” drivel come from, when all their ideas are so simplistic? Raising taxes by X always increases tax revenues by X. Increasing the number of government regulators necessarily increases the quality of regulation. A tiny fraction of the world’s greenhouse gases drives global climate change. Homosexuality has only one cause, and it’s normal because the other animals do it and the other animals are incapable of behavioral malfunction, because – we say so. Life starts at birth – all that stuff that happens during gestation doesn’t count. Pro-lifers want to control women. Fiscal conservatives are selfish. Religious conservatives think sex is dirty. American soldiers love killing (insert Arlo Guthrie lyrics here). Poverty and gun ownership cause crime. People who aren’t white must be represented in government by members of their own race. 9/11 was caused by American imperialism. The Cold War was caused by American saber-rattling. The Murrah Building bombing was caused by Rush Limbaugh. The Tuscon shooting was caused by Tea Party rhetoric. Palestinian terrorism is caused by the Israelis’ refusal to return to the 1967 borders…don’t tell me “what about the ’67 war” – that wasn’t the Palestinians, so it doesn’t count.

I can believe in a “liberal gene.” There is a growing body of research into behavior in some animal species that shows how behavior is influenced by hormonal effects. Much of this research is directed toward schizophrenia and, especially, autism. I can believe that some people are more directed by feelings and others by logic. That, to me, is the chief difference between the political philosophies we call left and right.
We can see how the political left is unwilling to admit that the national debt is extremely dangerous to our future as a country. They want to spend because that is what they do. They cannot admit there is a limit. If you bring this up around people like Kevin Drum, the answer is that it is not a problem. I remember a post of his at Washington Monthly where he argued that Social Security faced no funding crisis in the foreseeable future. He is a pretty reasonable guy and yet he cannot admit it.
We will see a deluge of this in the coming months as the Democrats fight spending cuts with sob stories and counter intuitive assertions that we can’t cut spending because it will hurt people. Thomas Sowell has a column today suggesting that we cut corporate welfare.“>
Of course, the corporate welfare queens have infested the whole global warming institution. Even as the logic of global warming is tottering, the left fights to defend it. Why ? Capitalism rapes the earth and is evil. We see this most clearly in energy policy. Britain is now learning what a disaster wind power is.
Solar power works only during daylight so between the two, there is no chance that they can provide the base requirements for our society. Germany, in spite of this, is planning to shut down all nuclear power. What will they do to solve the problem ? No answer. Fairy dust, perhaps.
The basic difference is between logic and feelings. I can believe that is genetic. Of course, many people begin as leftists as students, especially now with the leftward tilt of schools and teachers. Perhaps they are the indeterminate group. I tended to be that way in college but one economics class, even though it was not required for my major, cured me of that delusion.
Maybe if you spend a lot of time responding to your feelings, a part of the brain enlarges. The same could apply to logic. The premise is not unreasonable. The cause and effect relationship may very well be reversed. The visual cortex is underdeveloped in people who are blind from birth. The same may apply to behavior based on feelings or logic.

Leprosy causes its destruction of fingers and toes by causing loss of pain. Leg transplantation is not done because an anesthetic leg will rather quickly begin losing the foot due to constant minor trauma, just as diabetes does. This is because it does not have sensation.

“At least we have proof that brain damage is behind the reason why Liberals refuse to see reality.”
It is worse than that – according to now retired Michigan Med School Prof of clinical psychiatry, Dr. Pat Santy (Blogging now only lightly at “drsanity” – just google). The Left’s rhetorical tropes are characteristic of the psychotic. If last year’s Obama-approved and MSM echoed BEWARE the violent Right! (regardless of any evidence of it) did not convince you that they are addicted to paranoia and psychological projection, then the Gifford’s shooting in Tuscon only months ago (blamed on Palin, until it wsn’t) should!
Furthermore, almost all the reliable social science evidence inside of Hoover Institution scholar Peter Schwarz book “Makers and Takers” contradicts negative stereotypes about the Right. But does anyone on the left bother to ever read it? Not that I can tell. If they did, they couldn’t get away with stories like the one at the top – and their psychotic fantasy enemies.
Furthermore, this explains why on so many fronts – from realism about Fed government debt and global warming and Islamic terrorism – dialog and honest debate leading to compromise is impossible.

And who knew Soviet Psychiatry would become the model for America’s mental health professionals?
Who knew that the junk “sciences” would lead to this?
Everyone, but, alas, the majority of people and certainly the majority of academics approved.Jim Nantz was confused Sunday about which team won the Jets-Patriots game, insisting that the squad from New York defeated Tom Brady and company when in fact they lost.
The AFC East showdown turned out to be a thrilling affair. Though the Patriots led late in the game, the Jets stormed back with the help of a fumbled kickoff. Just before regulation ended Tom Brady was able to drive the Patriots into position to tie the game, sending it to the no-longer-sudden death overtime.
That is likely what got Jim Nance confused. The Patriots took the ball first in overtime and marched down the field, kicking a field goal that in previous years would have ended the game. This year, however, the NFL has extended the playoff rule that if the first team with the ball kicks a field goal, the other team is given a chance to score as well.
The Jets squandered that chance, as Mark Sanchez was sacked and fumbled the ball back to the Patriots, ending the game.
In the booth, a confused Jim Nantz said didn’t see it that way. The announcer said that the Jets win was the “stunner” of the day, DeadSpin noted.
USA Today speculated that there was more to Jim Nantz confused than a simple verbal mix-up. The report noted that the Jets were 10.5 point underdogs to the Patriots, and by losing in overtime the team covered the spread. It’s not likely Jim Nantz would explicitly mention gambling lines while on the air, the report noted, which is why he looked so embarrassed afterward.
He is right.. the jets did win that game..ok ok.. so the Pats scored more points..is that REALLLLLY the point of the game? Oh wait.. I guess it is.. Geez Nantz.
Who was that zonked out guy on drugs? He tried to act cool but just looked sounded stupid.
I don't think the inquisitor realized that the end YouTube video that they posted is full of profanity. Maybe they should actually check the entire video before posting it on their webpage.
The front pages of yahoo are cluttered with junk stories like this. Maybe if we could get rid of the useless stories, the homepage would look more like google's.
Jim Nantz has been confused for some time now. It's just that people are finally starting to notice.
Will it cause self esteem issues to have a winner and a loser. Let's just say they both won and call it a day.
Who cares?
so what
Nantz's error was clearly a strong mental error. The guy who posted this youtube video is simply a mental moron. Redneck, low bread, loser, mental idiot. A Florida transiant loser idiot. And moron…if you are reading this, look me up and come on up…I will show you how a Jet's fan will kick your rednect a$$…
I wonder who thought won the game if he was actually watching it. Oh, I'm sorry, he was watching it.
WHO CARES!
more chocolate cake.
Just wasted 2 minutes on this stupid story.
The Inquisitor probably should. They are the one's that posted a video with a bunch of profanity. I just think it's funny that they don't take the time to actually check the entire video before posting it on their website
If you don't care, then why are you commenting on my post?
Why does it matter if it has profanity? Are you trying to watch it in church or something?** For more detailed stories with quotes, pick up an issue of Tuesday’s Enterprise**
PN-G
What looked good: The beginnings of an effective, fast, spread offense are taking shape in Port Neches. Quarterback Ky Walker, although undersized, threw some crisp spirals. Senior Jeremiah Rose, who led the Indians in receiving last season, also looked sound.
A PN-G option attack also seems to be coming along. Walker, Rose and tailbacks mixed it up in pre-snap formations with Rose sometimes taking the handoff on a sweep or Walker opting for a play-action pass.
The Indians’ 3-4 defense will need to improve on last season, but it’s too soon to tell if that will happen.
Area of concern: Last year, inexperience was a big detriment to PN-G’s success. This season, in my opinion, the Indians will have to overcome being physically small for a 4A team. From what I saw Monday, combined with the existing size of some of the better teams in the district, that mismatch might be a hurdle for the Indians to overcome when it goes up against the better 20-4A squads.
Based on their own words… The Indians are as motivated as any team in the area this year. It’s easy to say, “yea, we’re going to go out there and get them,” but not really mean it if you’re a team that’s probably going to finish in the basement of its standings. But PN-G is an interesting case. This squad has a chip the size of an oil refinery on its shoulder from last year’s results and might have the pieces in place to grab a playoff spot. The task will be a tall one since Nederland, Central, Ozen and Vidor all look to be right up there, too.
NEDERLAND
What looked good: OK y’all, confession time. I was not at Nederland practice today for as long as I would have liked. I went to PN-G first and by the time I made it over to Nederland, the defense has already finished up. To be clear, this doesn’t mean I favor one team over the other. I’m one man trying to cover a whole bunch of programs.
The good news? DeShawn Washington is still big and very powerful. Kendrick Hopkins also looks ready to run over people this season and is 100% healthy.
Area of concern: How will the new starters preform? Graduation was not Nederland’s friend over the summer as it took quarterback Carson Raines, wide receiver Michael Shaw, linebacker Korbin Stampley, and linemen Brock Pryor and Koby Couron.
That’s a lot of playmakers and it’s very possible that their replacements fill the void sufficiently, but the verdict is still out.
I don’t think this will factor largely into Nederland not having another season full of victories, but the team will need depth if it hopes to make a deep playoff run.
Based on their own words…Enough is never enough. Washington said he had 16 sacks last season, but wants 20 this year. Hopkins rushed for a little over 1700 yards last season and said he wants 2,000 this year.
It will be hard to top last year’s postseason with the memorable victory against Pearland Dawson. And the Bulldogs may not go undefeated in District 20-4A for the third-straight year, but the target remains on Nederland’s back.Sunday against the New Orleans Saints, Kansas City Chiefs wide receiver Dexter McCluster suffered what appeared to be a serious elbow injury, which means backup running back Peyton Hills could see an increased workload as a result.
The Chiefs have had some early struggles, to say the least, and the loss of a serious threat in the passing game is nothing but more bad news.
Let's examine how the freak injury to McCluster will impact the offense and, more importantly, running back Peyton Hillis.
Back to the Running Game
With McCluster out, receiver Steve Breaston will move to the slot and Jonathan Baldwin will see an increased workload.
The problem with this strategy is neither receiver has been an effective option for the offense.
Both Breaston and Baldwin have not combined for double-digit catches this season and together hardly have more than 100 yards combined.
This is not to say that other players cannot step up in McCluster's absence, but they have not shown enough yet to be relied upon to win games. This means there will be more of a focus on the running game for Kansas City in the coming weeks.
Jamaal Charles' Health
Two years ago Charles was one of the best running back in the game, rushing for 1,467 yards, but he seriously injured his knee early last season.
The potential for Charles to still be one of the best is there. In the same game McCluster was hurt, Charles was well on his way to rushing for more than 200 yards on more than 20 carries.
For Charles to stay healthy, he is not going to be able to handle the load on his own. Fifteen carries a game is a safer bet for Charles to remain healthy.
In the past, Charles has been his best when sharing the load with a power back, which is where Hillis is so useful. Reducing Charles' carries will preserve his health and boost Hillis' value.
Outlook
Can Peyton Hillis be an effective spell for Jamaal Charles?
With McCluster out of the way and Charles on a pitch count to keep him healthy for an entire season, Hillis should now see in the neighborhood of 150 carries.
While Charles carries the majority of the load, Hillis can be effective in a spot role, carrying the ball in short-yardage situations and on the goal line.
If Charles and the passing game are effective, it is not unreasonable to think that Hillis could hit right around the same numbers he did a season ago.

I had the (maybe wrong) impression that FTP clients would regard symlinks as regular files and just get them regardlessly. If this really is a problem, we need hardlinks on FTP servers as well. The preferred mirroring method (rsync) preserves hardlinks, and they'll end up on CDs as well, so this is no problem.

The standard A5 piston housing has no venting ports (very bad). X7 Piston housing has forward exhaust ports only (better). Meaning that it only exhausts the air that is in front of the piston....not behind it. Its the air behind the piston that is doing all the work and really needs to be vented in order for faster loading.
Our QEPH is a forward and reverse exhaust tube. It exhausts the air in front the piston during the piston stroke and behind the piston at the end of the piston stroke. Venting the air in front of the piston in the early part of the stroke means that less pressure is needed to advance the loader and venting the air behind the piston allows the loader to return faster.
We were never impressed with the exhausting capacity of putting a normal QEV on the cyclone, and after seeing the X7 piston housing we decided to take it to the next level. We've combined those venting ideas into one part.
The materials we use are better than that of the stock piston housings, the internal finish is much smoother and is teflon coated, they perform much better (increasing speed and efficiency), and they look way cooler.
This part is designed to do what the normal QEV (Quick Exhaust Valve) attempts to do. With the QEPH there are no gaskets to keep clean, and its exhaust is exponentially faster.
All the QEPHs have polished internals and are teflon coated. This makes for the smoothest action.

i've read of this problem. and of how amphibians are like canaries in the cold mine.
it's heartening to hear that some people are trying to do something about it. and it's good of you to draw attention to this.
This makes for sad reading particularly the frog waving - because as well as attracting a mate it could also be waving goodbye because of the thread to the species.
poetry should have a point (most times) and yours does.
Lovely and sad.
NOOOOOOOOOOO :0(
I also found it sad but well written!
I like this because it's a very useful and significant poem - and I don't usually find words like biologist in poems.
I can't remember the last time I saw a toad :( I don't think I have seen many, being a city-person. It's sad.

That title is just fabulous. Have read about this problem too, and one scary theory says that virus might be propagated by the researchers themselves, visiting one infected pond and bringing it with them to the next place their visiting. It's so tragic.
Hello! Thank you for your kind comment at my site. I enjoy stopping in and saying hello to new people and...wow...your site is awesome. Beautiful picture on your header!
This is an excellent poem with a perfect title. Very sad but in a beautiful way. I love frogs, and the frog waving has two different levels of meanings for me. Thank you for sharing. It's very nice to meet you.
How very poignant. We have the same trouble here - frogs are becoming a thing of the past except for the huge American Bullfrog which eats all the local frogs, ducklings and anything else it can get in its rather large mouth. It was brought over for restaurants but some were released into the wild when eating frog legs was no longer a fad.
gosh, this one hits hard...
This brings back a childhood memory. My family and I were camping at a lake in Southeastern Alaska. During the evening the whole bank around the lake was covered with little frogs. I'd never seen so many together like that before, I never have again. I have a similar memory of looking into the water at a shallow spot and for as far as the eye could see, the bottom being covered with crab. I think those days are gone.... This poem is a great reminder to cherish what we have.

A few things immediately stand out: Michael Clayton isn’t on the top three at receiver; Piscitelli is starting at SS and Zuttah has the starting spot at LT. Before an opinion is made, remember, this chart will change once the games start.
Clayton has been running all week with the second-team receivers. Piscitelli and Jones have switched first reps since offseason workouts and Vincent is still learning the offense.
There’s a lot of football to be played before the final 53 are named.Welcome to L.A., written and directed by Alan Rudolph, is a fantastically effective natural sleep aid. I gather the film has a bit of a cult following, which is presumably why MGM has made this available as a “DVD-R on demand” release. The numerous recognizable actors who populate the cast will help to ensure on-going interest. But, honestly, this turgid bore of a movie was a chore for me to endure.
It’s not that I expect action-packed excitement from every movie I see. But Welcome to L.A. really tried my patience with its aimless shaggy dog story. The plot, what little there is, revolves around a group of vaguely interconnected Los Angeles residents. Carroll Barber (Keith Carradine) is a singer working on new material while having flings with nearly every woman he comes into contact with. His dad, Carl (Denver Pyle), is a successful businessman who has little respect for his vagabond-like son.
Among Carl Barber’s employees is Ken Hood (Harvey Keitel), who is dedicated and driven to acquiring as big a slice of the business pie as possible. Ken has a troubled marriage with his wife, Karen (Geraldine Chaplin), who is convinced that due to a chronic cough she is near death. Filling out the cast are Sally Kellerman as a real estate agent, Lauren Hutton as a photographer, and Sissy Spacek as a topless housekeeper. These characters all bounce off one another in the dullest ways possible (with the exception of the topless housekeeping, of which there is unfortunately precious little).
It would be nearly impossible to talk about Welcome to L.A. without mentioning the music. Richard Baskin, son of Baskin Robbins co-founder Burt Baskin, pops up throughout the film as a recording artist. His songs are heard non-stop throughout the movie. Baskin wrote some of the songs for Robert Altman’s Nashville. Altman produced Welcome to L.A., so I assume that’s how he got the job. But after hearing Baskin’s monotonous singer-songwriter stylings for an hour and a half, I felt like organizing a boycott of Baskin Robbins just to spite the family name. Simply put: the music in Welcome to L.A. is laughably bad. At least it provided those laughs, as nothing else in the movie is vaguely humorous (ignore any claims that this is a comedy).
Issued on DVD-R only, Welcome to L.A. is enhanced for 16:9 TVs. Be forewarned, the video quality is barely adequate for today’s high definition standards. Print flaws are frequent, there is very little depth to the black level, and the whole movie has a yellowed, faded look. Okay, the last part might have been intentional. I think maybe cinematographer David Myers was instructed to make it look as if the L.A. smog had even infiltrated the interiors.Powered by SidelinesProtestant Educators
Craig Dykstra
By Brad Wigger
CRAIG RICHARD DYKSTRA (b. 1947). Baptized in the Reformed Church of America, confirmed and later ordained to ministry as a Presbyterian, his career has served the church through congregational ministry, theological school teaching, writing, and philanthropy. His scholarly work in the areas of pastoral and ecclesial imagination, moral education, faith practices, and practical theology has provided a rich context for the field of Christian education even as his visionary support for faith-based institutions has strengthened the practice of religion in America.
Biography
Craig Dykstra was the first-born of three sons to Pauline and Richard Dykstra, who were living in Detroit Michigan at the time. Craig was not the first minister in the family; his maternal grandfather, the Rev. J. J. Hollebrands, was the pastor of the First Reformed Church of Detroit (RCA), the church in which Craig would be baptized and the family had long been deeply involved.
During his late childhood, Craig Dykstra’s family moved to the Detroit suburb of Grosse Pointe and eventually joined Grosse Pointe Memorial Church (a United Presbyterian church at the time) where the Rev. Bertram Atwood was the senior pastor. According to Dykstra, “he was an astounding preacher” who got at the “deep truth of the Christian gospel” by engaging Christian faith and serious theology with the deep concerns of human life during a time reeling with the conflicts of the Vietnam War and the civil rights movement. Dykstra was confirmed at Grosse Pointe Memorial, and between Atwood, the congregation, and his parents’ commitment to the church, he found profound opportunities for formation in the Christian life. This happened not only through participation in worship and education, but through music and choirs, camps and youth groups, as well as through the overall support of the congregation. In addition, the pastoral staff led study groups with the youth in which they read and discussed serious theological works in relation to the rapidly changing social world.
It was in these teen years that Dykstra met his wife to be, Betsy Hanson. They both attended Albion College for a year before transferring to the University of Michigan, where both finished their undergraduate degrees. Betsy graduated from the School of Education and devoted her career to teaching and school administration. Craig was a philosophy major. One of his most influential teachers was Professor Robert Adams, who offered a philosophy of religion course in which students read Buber, Kierkegaard, and Barth, among others, which provided an extension for Dykstra of the serious theological engagement that had begun with the study groups of his home church.
Toward the end of college, Dykstra decided to go to seminary. Graduating from Michigan in 1969, Craig and Betsy were married and moved to Princeton where Craig attended Princeton Theological Seminary and Betsy taught school. During the first year at Princeton, the Dykstra’s first son, Peter, was born, and a year later (1971), their second son, Andrew. This led to Craig laying out his second year of seminary to work a variety of jobs to help support his family—from tutoring at-risk children to working with youth at First Presbyterian Church of Moorestown, NJ. He was able to return to classes the following year and graduated with the MDiv degree in 1973.
At Princeton, Dykstra’s commitment to the church’s educational ministry grew and flourished under the guidance and teaching of James E. Loder, Freda Gardner and D. Campbell Wyckoff, all strong leaders in the field. Dykstra also directed the seminary’s Reigner Reading Room, the resource center and library for the seminary’s School of Christian education. At Princeton, he was able to build upon his love of philosophy as a student of Diogenes Allen, professor of philosophical theology, and as a student of Loder who drew heavily from Kierkegaard and other significant philosophical sources. Like Loder, Dykstra could integrate philosophical theology with Christian education in a way that brought together philosophical depth with engaging practice. Partly as a result of a senior thesis focused upon Kierkegaard, Dykstra was offered a PhD Fellowship in Practical Theology at Princeton to encourage him to continue working in the field.
After graduation in 1973, Dykstra received a call to the position of Assistant Minister at Westminster Church of Detroit (United Presbyterian), a large multi-staffed inner-city church whose congregation was racially integrated. At Westminster, Dykstra oversaw the Youth and Christian Education Programs, including the all-summer Camp Westminster on Higgins Lake in northern Michigan. While the year was very fruitful and a significant learning experience, the call of theological education was strong for Craig, and a time limit on his fellowship at Princeton loomed. So the Dykstras decided to return to Princeton Seminary in the fall of 1974 for Craig to pursue the PhD. The seminary accommodated his love of both philosophy and education and designed an interdisciplinary program that allowed him to integrate both fields. After finishing his comprehensive exams, in 1976, Dykstra returned to the job of directing the Reigner Reading Room, and served as an Instructor in Christian Education at the seminary. His dissertation was far along when he received a call to serve as an Assistant Professor of Christian Education at Louisville Presbyterian Theological Seminary in the summer of 1977. He successfully defended his dissertation, Christian Education and the Moral Life, in the spring of 1978, graduated, and was able to enjoy a great career of teaching and writing at Louisville.
In addition to enjoying his colleagues, Dykstra learned and grew under the guidance of the Louisville’s president, C. Ellis. Nelson, who at the time was already a senator in the field of Christian Education. Dykstra calls Nelson “a most wonderful man,” and fondly remembers that it was Nelson who actually picked Dykstra up at the airport when he had flown out for the interview. Nelson, for Dykstra, embodied so much of what he saw as important in the life of faith: a loving and gentle spirit, deep integrity, moral vision, educational imagination, and a love for the church. Just as Nelson’s Where Faith Begins emphasizes the community of faith in formation and education, Nelson believed the seminary community of faith was crucial to theological and ministerial formation. These values, this vision, and this man had a deep influence upon the seminary and on Dykstra himself. In many ways, the community echoed the ways those first communities of faith that shaped Dykstra’s own early Christian formation.
Louisville certainly gave Dykstra a fertile place to grow as a teacher, a writer, and as a leader. He often team-taught with seasoned teachers, courses such as: God, Evil, and the Practice of Ministry as well as DMin seminars with philosophical theologian Burton Cooper; The Art of Teaching with Old Testament scholar Gene March; a course developed with Louis Weeks, Congregation-Based Christian Education (made possible from a grant from the Lilly Endowment); as well as many other courses with colleagues. The communal spirit of the seminary and its classrooms had a profound effect upon Dykstra’s own educational imagination, one that carried into his teaching, writing, and leadership throughout his career. This can be seen in the emphasis upon the community of faith in Dykstra’s first book, Vision and Character: A Christian Educator’s Alternative to Kohlberg in 1981. More about this work will be described below, but for Dykstra, it is the community of faith where vision and character are cultivated and sustained.
The love and appreciation for this particular community of Louisville Seminary made all the more difficult the decision Dykstra faced when Princeton Seminary offered him the opportunity to return to Princeton as a Professor of Christian Education to begin in the fall of 1984. Dykstra was genuinely and openly torn about which of two great possibilities to pursue: the chance to continue the work he was doing in Louisville, or, the opportunity to teach PhD students at Princeton and work with his former mentors Freda Gardner and Jim Loder. As a colleague (Don Richter) witnessed one day during this time: Freda Gardner was in Louisville for a meeting and at the seminary having lunch with Craig in the cafeteria. On one side was Burton Cooper telling Craig all the reasons he should stay in Louisville; on the other side was Freda Gardner telling Craig all the reasons he should come to Princeton.
In the end Dykstra joined the faculty of Princeton Seminary in 1984 as the Thomas W. Synnott Professor of Christian Education. In addition to teaching, he became the Associate Editor of Theology Today and later, in 1987, became its Editor. At Princeton, Dykstra developed more formally theological themes that had taken root in Louisville: ecclesia (the formative power of the community of faith); theological vision (as an alternative to developmental frameworks for the life of faith); and faith practices (as a way of organizing practical theology as well as educational ministry).
Through teaching and writing (described below) Dykstra brought these themes not only to the fields of Practical Theology and Christian Education, but into the classroom. In addition to readings and discussion, Dykstra implemented pedagogies that embodied communal and generative ways of teaching and learning. As one of his former students remembers, “In Craig’s classes, we always knew we were all in this together—learning from Craig, of course, but from one another.” For Dykstra, faithful practice bears epistemological weight—whether in classrooms or congregations, in communities or households. That is, some things can only be known as they are lived, bodily, and shared in the community of faith. As a result, these themes, ideas, practices, and “knowings” took shape in the educational imaginations and practices of countless seminary students, who in turn, have taken them into congregations and seminaries.
The depth and clarity of thought in this work, combined with his integrity, as well as administrative facility and vision, no doubt led to another difficult decision. In the spring of 1989, The Lilly Endowment approached Dykstra to be its Vice President for Religion. A fellow Christian Educator, Robert Lynn, had held the position and it was he who identified Dykstra as a person to consider. The position is responsible for the oversight of the nation’s largest grant-making program in religion, and after consulting with trusted friends and colleagues, Dykstra accepted the offer. “And,” in his words, “a large world opened up.” The work took him, formally, out of the field of Christian Education, but his vision and many of the themes and practices developed earlier went with him as he worked with a wide range of institutions—including seminaries, universities, secular organizations, denominations, and more. In fact, a strong emphasis in this work was to enable leaders of institutions, practitioners, scholars, and writers to work and think together rather than in isolation. The same communal spirit brought to his classrooms, Dykstra brought to the work of philanthropy.
Dykstra stayed at Lilly until July, 2012, a tenure he calls “a glorious twenty-three years.” Retiring from Lilly (though he now serves on its Board of Directors), he took the position of Research Professor of Practical Theology and Senior Fellow in Leadership Education at Duke University Divinity School. At the time of this writing (2013), Dykstra continues to teach and to write. He has two major writing projects underway, one focused on the general subject of religion and philanthropy; the other focused upon a practical theology of institutional life. Dykstra’s career has placed him in a unique position to understand religious institutions. In his words, he has seen “how beautiful it is when institutions work collaboratively” not just within any particular organization, but between them so they “become a community of practice, attempt new ways to do important things, experiment, and learn from one another.” He hopes to marshal his experience with and vision for institutions, in writing and in practice, to encourage them to share their abundance of gifts so they may flourish. In this, Craig Dykstra still thinks and works like a faithful educator.
Contributions to Christian Education
In one sense Craig Dykstra’s work cannot be contained by any particular academic or theological field, even that of Christian education. In another sense, Dykstra has brought the sensibilities and vision of educational ministry—of a faithful teacher—to his entire vocational life. A glimpse of these sensibilities is provided by a story Dykstra tells of one of his earliest teaching roles, that is, as a swimming instructor at the YMCA while he was in seminary.
Teaching nervous, teeth-gritting preschoolers how to swim, provides, as Dykstra describes it, deep lessons in faith and Christian education. The first task is to help the children trust the water. Trust, in this sense, is a very specific kind of knowledge: “In a deeply somatic, bodily way—and in a way that is in no small part existential, for it is a knowledge that must be strong enough to address their fears—they must come to know the buoyancy of the water.” He describes gently taking children into the water, helping them relax and not clutch up their muscles. With an assuring hand beneath their backs, he lets the children feel the buoyancy of the water, a buoyancy that must be known and trusted, if they are to learn to swim. “So it is with the life of faith. At the heart of the Christian life, there lies a deep, somatic, profoundly personal but very real knowledge. It is the knowledge of the buoyancy of God” (2008, April 8).
This illustration works at many levels when considering Dykstra’s contributions to the field of Christian Education, and these are explored below through his writings.
Intellectual Context. The era in which Dykstra began his academic career, in the late 1970’s, was an era in which the developmental approach of Lawrence Kohlberg dominated discussions of moral and religious education. For Kohlberg, there is a cognitive pattern of information-processing (a structure) of morality that can be studied through the judgments a person makes about situations involving ethical dilemmas. Maturing in moral reasoning happens through identifiable stages, in a way similar to the stages Piaget describes in a child’s cognitive development, but for the whole lifespan. This developmental approach would soon be extended to faith itself, through the work of James Fowler and his faith development theory, which would have an even greater impact upon the field of Christian education. Fowler describes faith as also involving universal structures that organize patterns of trust, loyalty, and commitment; and these structures can (but may not) develop through the entire lifespan.
Vision and Character. In relation to these large trends in developmental theory, Dykstra found himself going against the grain, and much of his early work sought to establish a different vision of the moral world and the life of faith. This alternative vision is first articulated in Dykstra’s dissertation (Christian Education and the Moral Life, 1979) and its revision in his first book, Vision and Character: A Christian Educator’s Alternative to Kohlberg (1981).
Influenced by his own teachers, Diogenes Allen and James Loder of Princeton Theological Seminary, as well as the philosophical writings of Iris Murdoch and Gabriel Marcel, Dykstra brings a deep critique of the description of the moral life as characterized by stages of intellectual decision-making. As he puts it, morality is not simply “a matter of intellectual operations.” Instead, “Morality is a matter of love. It is a matter of love which takes the form of the apprehension of the mystery of reality” (1979, 181-182).
Key to this alternative vision is Dykstra’s special use of the term mystery, drawn particularly from Marcel. Dykstra is not using the word in its ordinary meaning of a baffling riddle or a problem with no solution. Instead, mystery is the inexhaustible particularity of existence, and it “means that it is impossible for us ever to get things settled, tied down, secured” (1979, 102). Mysteries are irreducible. And the apprehension of mystery—of life, of others, of self—is to recognize and honor this irreducibility. I am, you are, life is, ever more than our rational minds could ever conceptualize—at any stage of development—and our ability to attend to mystery is the font from which the moral life flows.
In this approach to the moral life, the great temptation is to treat mysteries as problems, that is, to reduce them, to refuse to encounter them in their fullness and depth (1981, 35). Reducing people to their roles or to stereotypes, for example, is to turn mysteries into problems. Why would we do this? Dykstra answers: fear and the consequent need to control. “Real people cannot be controlled as problems can, and we become afraid when we begin to lose control over things” (1981, 37).
The ethical life, therefore, is less about moral reasoning and problem-solving and more about mystery-encountering vision. That” (1981, 36). Encountering the world as mystery is a matter of vision, a way of seeing in depth. Character—our way of being in life—is thoroughly intertwined with seeing and “depends not only with what is in front of our eyes, but also on what lies within our hearts and minds. Who we are determines what we see” (1981, 50).
Even so, who we are and what we see has a lot to do with the contexts in which we live and learn, particularly our social contexts and with their particular ways of being. Dykstra follows other Christian educators, such as C. Ellis Nelson and John Westerhoff, who emphasize the socializing role of the church. The community of faith helps shape our “perceptions, values, and identities” (1981, 124). In the Christian life, the ability to apprehend mystery and grow in love is cultivated and sustained in the community of faith and its disciplines of repentance, prayer, and service—in short, through worship, which is paradigmatic. “To grow morally means to turn one’s life into worship” (1981, 106).
The community of faith—as it worships—forms the context in which to learn the ways of the mystery-encountering ethical life. And the role of Christian education is to help facilitate this vision and character formation. A teacher in this context, is the one “who is intentionally responsible for involving learners in the experience of the repenting, praying and serving community in such a way that its various aspects might be explored, shared, understood, and participated in” (1981, 125).
In a way, apprehending mystery is like apprehending buoyancy; it has to be known directly, bodily, personally, if it is to be trusted. Teachers are needed to introduce us to it, to help us relax, un-clinch, and not be afraid of the depths. And this is as true for whole communities as it is for individuals.
Faith Development. Can this learning, this knowing, be captured in stage development theory? For Dykstra, the answer is: probably not. The issue is not whether there are stages of life, that is, periods characterized by one kind of concern or another—childhood and adolescence, finding love and vocation, parenting, etc. But any and all of these times can be marked by death, fear, and suffering, for example, by all that can make us clutch and grit and drown. If faith is about knowing buoyancy—especially in the face of existential fears and challenges—it is unclear what stage theory is describing. Or is faith something else?
This was a fundamental question Dykstra raised in his next publishing project, Faith Development and Fowler (1986), a multi-author volume co-edited with Sharon Parks. In a chapter entitled “What Is Faith: An Experiment in the Hypothetical Mode,” Dykstra poses a thought experiment concerning the nature of faith: if faith is ____, then ____. He takes up Fowler’s own description of faith and considers whether stage theory makes sense for it. Key is that Fowler understands faith as a structural component of human existence as such—it is universal, though expressed in a wide variety of ways through whatever humans trust and are loyal to. So, Dykstra asks, if faith is what Fowler says it is, then does it make sense to consider it developmental? And Dykstra’s answer is yes.
However, Dykstra takes up an alternative definition to see whether stage theory would be appropriate. Borrowing from John Cobb, Dykstra suggests this definition: “faith is appropriate and intentional participation in the redemptive activity of God” (Dykstra, 1986a, 55). In this case, faith is not by definition universal, not a generic structural feature; instead it is “a possibility in human existence, but not a necessity” (Dykstra, 1986a, 55). So if faith is what Dykstra says it is, then does it make sense to consider it developmental? His answer is no. For Dykstra, faith is something we can grow in, but it is not the same thing as human development or a general capacity of human existence.
Nonetheless, Dykstra sees some common ground with Fowler when it comes to religious education. Fowler understands the purpose of church education as being for creative discipleship, not for faith development itself. Faith development helps us better understand the readiness of people for that discipleship. Dykstra agrees, but would call the response of discipleship itself faith, rather than the readiness (1986a, 63).
Ecclesia. Even as Dykstra was describing an alternative to developmental theory, he was also refining and extending his understanding of the importance of the social context, the ecclesial nature, of Christian education. In 1987 he published an article for the journal Religious Education called, “The Formative Power of the Congregation,” that draws heavily from the philosophical theologian Edward Farley and his phenomenological analysis of the church in Ecclesial Man.
The critique of and concern about schools of enculturation and socialization in Christian education has been that people can be socialized and enculturated into terrible ways of being. Communities can cultivate and even institutionalize all forms of turning mysteries into problems, from racial hatred to religious bigotry. As Dykstra (borrowing from James Loder) puts it, in congregational life, as much as in other social contexts, we may be “engaged in socially acceptable (indeed, socially celebrated) patterns of mutual self-destruction” (1987, 532).
One response to this concern has been Thomas Groome’s “shared praxis” approach to Christian education, which is to engage people in critical reflection in the light of the Christian Story. Dykstra, in “Formative Power of the Congregation,” appreciates Groome’s work on the one hand, but on the other finds it insufficient. It begs the question: how do we reflect critically? Facing our flaws and cooperation with principalities and powers is no easy task. First, critical reflection can itself be co-opted by the very destructive patterns from which we seek freedom. Second, even conscious awareness of our condition does not necessarily provide the critical leverage on our behaviors needed to break the hold, as anyone suffering addiction could testify. The fears, compulsions, or distorted desires feeding the destructive ways run deeper than reflective consciousness or the ego’s will. So, for Dykstra, critical reflection does not by itself have the power to break the hold of destructive ways of being (sin); genuine critical reflection is instead a fruit of something more profound (1987, 537).
Dykstra, following an existentialist stream of thought, sees death and chaos as the ultimate threat to human existence, a threat that operates largely at pre-reflective levels of knowing. Accompanying this threat however is a corresponding refusal of chaos and meaninglessness. Our anxiety over death is countered by a drive for life. Following Farley, Dykstra notices the forms that refusal of chaos can take: self-securing on the one hand, or faith on the other. Self-securing is a form of refusal built upon our own powers and efforts. But such anxious striving inevitably fails—we still die; chaos reigns—and at some level we know this and are plagued by this fundamental insecurity. “Unless there is this reality which does in fact establish and sustain us, secure us in existence, notice us in love, permanently and utterly, and unless, through faith, somehow deep within our being we know that, we have no choice but to continue desperately to secure our own selves” (1987, 539). Faith, then, is the deep and personal knowledge that God is the power of life and the power to refuse chaos. Faith is the power to break the hold of sin. While we are never completely free of sin and its temptations, faith can modify our self-destructive ways in the direction of redemptive ways characterized by love and freedom.
Yet faith is no achievement (which would make it another form of self-securing). It is a gift mediated by communities of faith. As congregations 1) acknowledge patterns of self-destruction (confession), and 2) admit its incapacity to secure themselves (repentance), and 3) celebrate the securing power that is God alone (proclamation and prayer), in short as congregations worship, the power of sin is potentially broken up by the power of God’s love. “Through worship, patterns of mutual self-destruction become redemptively transformed” (1987, 540). Worship, in this sense, is more than what happens in ritual; it is a lifestyle, one that indwells the rhythms of confession and repentance, proclamation and prayer, and issues in ways of being characterized by love and freedom. Worship, in this sense, testifies to a power beyond ourselves (communally and individually) to the ground of life, of freedom, of security, of a love transcending our fragile, chaos-plagued, lives.
Here is an extension of themes first articulated in Vision and Character—the importance of the social context for faith and education, along with its disciplines and ways of being. Christian education in this view is totally dependent upon the worshipping church even while it helps the community of faith understand its own experience, to “grasp the inner character and hidden nature of the mutual self-destruction and redemption that goes on in its own experience in order that it…may more and more be open to the redemptive activity of God” (1987, 546). We are able to grow in our ability to be open to and respond to God’s redemptive activity among us, that is, to grow in the life of faith.
We could say that Christian education in the context of the worshiping community helps the church understand its experience of the buoyancy of God. To that end, it helps relieve our insecurities, relax our scared bodies and anxious self-securing ways that we may delight in the loving power that uphold us.
Practices. When Dykstra moved from Louisville to Princeton Seminary in 1984, he joined the Practical Theology faculty and began teaching PhD students for the first time. This work included helping future practical theologians think through the methodological concerns of the field, a field that was suffering something of an identity crisis at the time.
“Theology and theological education are burdened by a picture of practice that is harmfully individualistic, technological, ahistorical, and abstract” (1991, 35). So writes Dykstra in an essay entitled “Reconceiving Practice,” that reflects an emphasis that would attend his work for the next two decades. This problematic picture of practice only serves to reinforce what Farley calls the “clerical paradigm” in which our understanding of practice is a minister doing something—teaching, preaching, counseling, for example—for, or to, or on behalf of someone else. Practical theology, here, is designed to help the minister do this.
Christian education in such a paradigm is focused upon administering programs and on the craft of teaching; and the measures of success rest in utility—the results or effects of an individual’s effort and the procedures used. No doubt administration and teaching are crucial components to Christian education, but for Dykstra they are necessary but insufficient dimensions of helping a church engage in creative discipleship or understand its own experience of God’s redemptive power.
As a way of re-imagining practical theology, Dykstra focuses first on notions of practice. If practice is reconceived along lines outside the clerical paradigm, perhaps practical theology could find sturdier ground. Dykstra finds help for this in the work of Alasdair MacIntyre who understood practice as a “coherent and complex form of socially established cooperative human activity” (MacIntyre, 1981, 175; Dykstra, 1991, 42). Key here is that practices are socially established, that is, they are activities done together—from playing baseball to worshipping God. In addition there are goods internal to the practices themselves, realized only by participating well in them (Dykstra, 1991, 45). That is, practices bear epistemological weight. “Engagement in certain practices may give rise to new knowledge” (Dykstra, 1991, 45). Some realities may only be apprehended through participation in particular practices. This is crucial to Christian education.
Dykstra draws an example from Marianne Sawicki’s analysis of Luke-Acts: action on behalf of the needy was a precondition for apprehending the resurrected Jesus, not the result (Sawicki, 1988; Dykstra, 1991, 46). The practice of hospitality to “all who had need” put early followers of Christ in the position to apprehend the mystery of resurrection, to know God’s refusal of death and chaos. Epistemological weight is another way of talking about revelation.
Practices, then, are key to theological formation according to Dykstra, not only for church leaders, but for everyone in the community of faith. This formation, this habitus, “is profound, life-orienting, identity-shaping participation in the constitutive practices of Christian life” (1991, 50). And our participation in these practices is something that must be learned. We learn best by doing them, with others, and this requires teachers who are also our partners in these practices. Because clergy will also be teachers of practices, clergy education is an important realm for church leaders to explore and deepen their ability to participate in them. At the same time, practices are communal activities and larger than clergy or teachers or any individual.
“Reconceiving Practice” was written while Dykstra was still at Princeton, in 1989, but he soon left to become the Vice President for Religion of the Lily Endowment, Inc. While the move took him away from direct teaching in theological education, it allowed a flourishing of his ideas. With the help of the Endowment and under the leadership of Dorothy Bass, the Valparaiso Project initiated a writing project involving theologians of many varieties to explore multiple Christian practices—from hospitality and discernment, to testimony and Sabbath-keeping—and became the book Practicing Our Faith: A Way of Life for a Searching People (1997).
This was only the beginning as over twenty additional books revolving around this understanding of practice have been generated through the Project, along with a website full of resources () for adults and youth alike. One of these books is Dykstra’s own Growing in the Life of Faith: Education and Christian Practices (1998). Growing includes previous writings (such as “The Formative Power of the Congregation”) as well as new descriptions of deep themes such as practice and growing in faith.
The contributions made to the church and Christian education by way of practices is immeasurable. We can notice though, that what began for Dykstra as an emphasis upon disciplines (of repentance, prayer, and service) for the moral life and for apprehending mystery has become a focus for vast number of scholars, writers, pastors, and teachers. Most importantly, people of faith are actually engaging in practices and finding meaning and power in them. They are, as Dykstra puts it, “habitations of the Spirit,” that is, the “places in the contours of our personal and communal lives where a habitation of the Spirit is able to occur.” (1998, 64) These places, like swimming pools, are where we come to know buoyancy.
Pastoral Imagination. “It is a beautiful thing to see a good pastor at work,” opens Dykstra in “Pastoral and Ecclesial Imagination,” a chapter from For Life Abundant: Practical Theology, Theological Education, and Christian Ministry (2008), a multi-author book he also co-edited with Dorothy Bass. After nearly twenty years of serving at the Lily Endowment, Dykstra has worked with and supported all manner of scholarship, research, theological education, and religious institution, not only through grant-making, but through guidance and wisdom born of years of leadership experience. But the focus of Dyskstra’s most recent publications (and a fundamental theological concern) has been pastors in congregations.
“Somehow, pastors who really get what the Christian ministry is all about and who do it well are able to enter many diverse situations, whether joyous or full of misery and conflict, and see what is going on there through the eyes of faith.” Here we can see the deep themes of vision and character connected explicitly to faith and the practice of ministry. “This way of seeing and interpreting shapes what the pastor thinks and does and how he or she responds to people in gestures, words, and actions. … This way of seeing and interpreting is what I mean by ‘pastoral imagination.’” Pastoral imagination emerges over time in the midst of ministry, and “functions as a kind of internal gyroscope, guiding pastors in and through every crevice of pastoral life and work” (2008, 41). We can see here, then, how the practice of ministry, for Dykstra, bears epistemological weight and yields goods intrinsic to the practice.
Playing off of Howard Gardner’s theory of multiple intelligences, Dykstra even sees a kind of pastoral intelligence at work in the pastoral imagination. It is not so much an additional, discrete intelligence (in Gardner’s sense) but a dynamic coherence of all the intelligences in pastoral work—from arranging worship space and creating budgets, to understanding people and music and the power of words. “To be a good pastor, you have to be very smart in lots of really interesting ways” (51).
Dykstra understands that the demands of ministry, the demands on multiple intelligences, the demands of a pastoral imagination, are overwhelming. But it is precisely at this point that he tells the story of teaching children to swim. The pastoral imagination rests on the knowledge of the buoyancy of God, “a deep, profound, existential knowledge that infuses not only our minds, but also our hearts and even our bodies” (56).
Key, however, to this deep knowledge buoying a pastoral imagination, is ecclesial imagination. Why? Because the life of faith and ministry is life together, is shared knowledge. Ecclesial imagination emerges in the community of faith, that is, in people’s responses to God’s redemptive activity. It “fosters a way of seeing and being” characterized by humility, listening and learning, attentiveness, and it is deeply hopeful, generous, caring, and dedicated to the next generation (57). When pastoral imagination intersects with ecclesial imagination, “ministry is received as a gift of God within a larger life of faith shared by pastors and people.” This yields a kind of existential freedom from (futile) self-securing and striving and freedom for life abundant— “instead of working frenetically and compulsively to harness their own powers and energies, pastors are somehow set free to receive, draw upon, release, and share in the multiple energies and capacities of the people of their congregations and of the whole body of Christ” (56).
When Dykstra writes of the pastoral imagination, strictly speaking, he has gone beyond the field of Christian education. Yet, we can see that he is still thinking like his own understanding of a teacher: to help the church understand its own experience of buoyancy, that it may swim and thrive. In addition, with his work with and concern for institutions, Dykstra is taking this teaching role into an even larger public.

On mystery and visional ethics:
Visional ethics might be described as a mystery-encoutering ethic. When I use the term mystery here, I use it in a special way, not the one we ordinarily use in common speech. In ordinary usage a mystery is a baffling puzzle or riddle, a perplexing problem that no one seems to have the answer to. Mysteries in this sense have solutions. …
I am using the term in quite a different way, one that is biblical in nature and connects it with the idea of revelation. George Hendry writes that a mystery in the New Testament sense is a mystery “not because it offers so little to our understanding, but because its superabundant wealth overwhelms our understanding” (Hendry, 156). Here a mystery is not a problem that goes away once figured out. Instead, mystery is an enduring reality that we know only through a glass darkly and never exhaustively. …
This, I recognize, is all rather abstract at the moment. But what I want to suggest is (34-36).
On disciplines:
The importance of discipline in the moral life has become obscured in our culture and in the church as well. … But Christians have historically understood the formation of the moral life as formation in discipleship. …
There are, I am sure, many ways to describe the disciplines of the Christian life. Each differen way will highlight some aspects and ignore others. But there are three disciplines that seem to me to be fundamental and generic. They are disciplines of repentance, prayer, and service. Through these disciplines, the church has trained its people for discipleship—for active engagement in the world as person formed by Christian faith. I believe theses disciplines merit our renewed attention if we are to be effective Christian educators for the moral life (89-90)

Dykstra, C. (1986c). What is faith? An experiment in the hypothetical mode. In C. Dykstra & S. Parks (Eds.), Faith development and Fowler (pp. 45-64). Birmingham, AL: Religious Education Press.
I would suggest that faith is appropriate and intentional participation in the redemptive activity of God. …
Because faith is understood here as a possibility, but no a necessity, an interesting advantage arises. This way of understanding faith helps make some sense of idolatry as an opposite of faith. In the understanding of faith that Fowler adopts, idolatry is a form of faith. We may trust in and be loyal to what is not truly God, but that is still faith in Fowler’s terms. This is because, for him, faith is in no way necessarily correlated with God. Thus he is in the odd position of having to say that in idolatry we still “faith” (to use the word as a verb). In the understanding I have presented this problem does not arise (55-56).
Nevertheless, there is at least room for mutual edification. In one essay, Fowler says that education in the church needs to be understood as “education for creative discipleship” and that this is something different from “education for faith development.” Since “creative discipleship” is very close to what I mean by faith, Fowler’s understanding of both the distinction and the connection between the two is worth exploring. … He says we “cannot afford to neglect the question of what human beings bring, by way of readiness to respond, to the encounter with the record of revelatory event and to tradition.” … To me, it is the response itself, rather than the readiness, that is faith. But I agree with Fowler that his theory can help us to understand that readiness (63).

Theology and theological education are burdened by a picture of practice that is harmfully individualistic, technological, ahistorical, and abstract. This current picture, implicit in our imaginations and explicitly in our actual ways of doing things, is implicated in many of the problems that communities of faith, theology as a body and activity of thought, and theological education in all its contexts are now struggling to overcome. Unless a revised understanding of practice takes root in our endeavors, these problems will remain unresolved. But there is an alternative to the current picture available to us, one that has potential to reorient our ways of thinking theologically about practice. Then certain dimensions of our understandings and practice of theological education, not only in seminaries and divinity schools but also in congregations, might be improved (35).
Suppose that practices central to Christian life are conditions under which various kinds and forms of knowledge emerge—knowledge of God, of ourselves, and of the world; knowledge that is not only personal, but also public. Suppose that through such practices, the virtues and character and wisdom of the communities and individuals who participate in them are formed. Suppose that through participation in practices of Christian life, the community of faith comes continually to awareness of and participation in the creative and redemptive activity of God in the world. If these suppositions are sustainable, practices deserve a pivotal place in Christian formation, theological study, and theological education (49-50).

Exploring the range and depth of a single practice could take a lifetime. That is partly because each is so rich and various. Every practice has taken an astonishing variety of specific forms, in history and around the world today. Moreover, every practice is a place of mystery: a gracious vessel that can be broken by loveless acts. Practices call for a lifetime of exploration because we are constantly learning more about what it means to do them well—and learning it right in the middle of our doing.
Education in Christian practices is always going on within the life of Christian communities. It happens as parents teach children the economics of a household or as friends surround a widow in her time of grief. Our most important education for practice happens in the course of life-in-community. It is education that takes place in the ongoing patterns of life together. This is like belonging to a congregation at song: you learn, even as a child, to take your pitch from others, to clap along or not to, to anticipate certain melodies at certain times of the year. You use your whole body, and you draw on the musical tastes and training you have developed outside the church as well as in it. You may discover that you have special talent; or you may not, in which case you keep on singing along anyway but let others do the solos. This kind of learning—communal but unplanned—takes place all the time.
But there is also a place for more deliberate efforts to help one another grow in understanding and doing the practices in light of our faith. This can be the focus of graduate study in theology or, with a different approach, of youth group retreats. It will flourish most fully when trust and mutual respect are present, for the agenda needs to include an honest look at the ways in which our practices—and therefore ourselves and our world—are broken. The deepest learning will happen when people practice as well as talk, and when they are willing to look closely at the concrete acts that give a practice shape (198).

On the formative power of congregations:
The exploration begins with and is structured by two basic claims: (1) a basic reality of congregational life is that we are often engaged in socially acceptable (indeed, socially celebrated) patterns of mutual self-destruction; and (2) in and through congregational life, these patterns are at the same time being redemptively modified, transformed. Congregations are profoundly caught up in powerful patterns of sin and alienation. This we must admit. But despite and even within the context of its embeddedness in these patterns, the congregation mediates redemptive power. Precisely in the midst of its sinfulness, rather than apart from it, the congregation has power to mediate the gospel in such a way that the “speaking” of it can re-structure and transform human personal and social life (84).
On Sunday school teaching:
One Sunday many years ago, on returning home from church, I was having the typical what-did-you-do-in-Sunday-school-today conversation with my two sons. The younger, who was six, came up with this: “My teacher, we made bread together and I ate mine already and it was good.” I didn’t pay much attention at the time, but the line stuck with me. As I thought about it, it occurred to me that he had said something both simple and deep about what good teaching in the church is like.
“Made bread together.” The word bread, the image of bread: “This is my body broken for you.” “I am the bread of life. He who comes to me will never be hungry.” “Is there one among you who would hand his son a stone when he asked for bread?” To make bread together in Christ’s name is to make life together. And this is exactly what my son and his teacher were doing. I think they bother knew it, in some mostly unsuspecting way. …
Teaching in church school is nine parts getting a weary body out of bed early on Sunday mornings, cutting out construction-paper patterns, cleaning hardened glue from tables too low to bend over gracefully, matching the right snow boot with the right foot, and keeping noise levels within moderate bounds. But those nine parts are the things that make one part possible. And if you, as a teacher, are ever fortunate enough to overhear one of the children in you class say, “My teacher, we made bread together and I ate it and it was good,” you will what that one part is (162-164).

Years ago, when I was a seminary student, I worked for a time at the local YMCA, teaching swimming lessons. My students were three-and four-year-olds. Each Saturday morning at 9:00, down the steps they would come from the locker rooms into the pool area. As their parents sat along the wall, watching warily, the little ones wandered over toward the shallow end of the pool, where I was waiting.
You know how little kids hold themselves when they are cold and at least a little bit nervous. They clutch up and shiver. They hold themselves tight and grit their teeth. Well, it is a law of nature that you cannot swim while cramping your body and gnashing your teeth. So what I would do is take one child at a time off the edge of the pool and into my arms. Holding them close, I would carry them gently into the water. As we went, we talked quietly. I tried to make them smile and ease them into relaxation. Along the way, I would dip down into the water, allowing them to feel the warmth of it and the flow of it across their skin. After a while—maybe on their third or fourth venture with me into the deep—I would sink them lower and let them feel the water buoying them up. Eventually I could lay them on their backs and, holding my hands beneath them, get them to begin to relax their knees, let loose the muscles in their necks, and slowly draw air into their lungs. At first, of course, when I would remove my hands, they would panic a bit. They would clutch up again and start to sink. But sooner or later, they would finally get the feel of what it is like to float. And at that point, they could roll over and start to swim.
The first priority in teaching children to swim is to enable them to trust the water. Somehow or another they have to come to a specific kind of knowledge. In a deeply somatic, bodily way—and in a way that is in no small part existential, for it is a knowledge that must be strong enough to address their fears—they must come to know the buoyancy of the water.

We consider a model of quantum computation in which the set of elementary operations is limited to Clifford unitaries, the creation of the state |0>, and qubit measurement in the computational basis. In addition, we allow the creation of a one-qubit ancilla in a mixed state rho, which should be regarded as a parameter of the model. Our goal is to determine for which rho universal quantum computation (UQC) can be efficiently simulated. To answer this question, we construct purification protocols that consume several copies of rho and produce a single output qubit with higher polarization. The protocols allow one to increase the polarization only along certain "magic" directions. If the polarization of rho along a magic direction exceeds a threshold value (about 65%), the purification asymptotically yields a pure state, which we call a magic state. We show that the Clifford group operations combined with magic states preparation are sufficient for UQC. The connection of our results with the Gottesman-Knill theorem is discussed.

Ice Hockey
MONTCLAIR - The makeup of the West Milford ice hockey team suggests that the Highlanders may be a force to be reckoned with around Passaic County in the years to come.
A large contingent of freshman and sophomores make up most of the West Milford roster this season. In fact three freshmen started in Friday night's Passaic County Tournament game against Clifton.
As bright as the future is for the Highlanders the West Milford squad is only worried about the immediate future and that includes Saturday's Passaic County Tournament semifinal game against Wayne Hills.
The fourth seeded Highlanders earned a right to take on the top seeded Patriots when they knocked fifth seeded Clifton 4-1 in their first round game Friday night at Floyd Hall.
"Wayne Hills is huge," said West Milford senior goaltender Ross Mantione. "I am hoping for some good things. I want to win the whole thing. Being on the team for the last four years we have not [had much success]. Winning this thing would be the best that we could get out of the four years."
Against the Mustangs the only blemish on Mantione's night was after a neutral zone giveaway that led to a Clifton goal.
"Ross played great, a mistake by a forward stole the shutout but he played great," said West Milford head coach Dan Frey.
With Mantione nearly unbeatable in net the Highlanders got all the offense they would need in the first period as Chris Dressler scored less then three minutes into the contest.
Junior Joey Fenui, who had assisted on the Dressler goal, increased the West Milford lead to 2-0 with 54 seconds left in the first period when he pounded a rebound past the Clifton goaltender.
Dressler scored his second goal of the game with under four minutes left in the second period when he corralled a loose puck around center ice, sprinted towards the Mustangs goal and fired a shot into the back of the net.
Clifton would score with 2:44 left in the game but Brandon Little got the lead back to three when he scored off an assist from Fenui that made the score 4-1.
After the game Frey admitted that he was not thrilled with the Highlanders effort but he knew that winning is the most important thing when it comes to tournament situations.
"I was not happy with the effort but I have to curb that a little because they were a little under the weather," said Frey who admitted that his team might have been looking ahead to a matchup with the Patriots. "We told them over and over not to look past Friday because it will be over if you look past Friday but they are drooling a little bit because they want to prove that they are legit."
In their first two matchups this season the Patriots have knocked off the Highlanders. In their first matchup Wayne Hills blanked West Milford 7-0. Last week the Highlanders were in the game up until the closing seconds of a game they lost 5-3.
"It is tough to beat a team three times in one season so hopefully they won't beat us three times in one season," said Frey.
In the 2012-13 Passaic County Tournament the West Milford hockey team knocked off Clifton 2-1 before falling to Wayne Hills 5-2 in the semifinals.
This year the Highlanders hope the tournament similarities end after the first round.
"This is the same spot we were in last year. We came in and we were with Hills for a while but then at the end they just poured it on and beat us pretty good," said Frey. "[The West Milford players] know the negative outcome, lets see if they can change that moving forward with that experience."Sun City West, 2 bedrooms 2 baths

Woman killed in Vallecito mobile home fire
DESTRUCTION—The remnants of Faith Margolis’ coach at Vallecito Mobile Home Park in Newbury Park.
ANNA BITONG/Acorn Newspapers Due to lack of evidence, investigators may not be able to determine what caused a mobile home fire in Newbury Park last week that killed a 74-year-old woman.
Faith Diane Margolis and her cat were found dead inside the coach after the early morning fire on April 13 at the Vallecito Community mobile home park in the 200 block of Monte Vista. A second cat that belonged to Margolis, who lived there for 29 years, was not found, said Vallecito manager Ron Gellenbeck.
The cause of her death was inhalation of combustible products and thermal cutaneous injuries, or burns, said Armando Chavez, senior deputy medical examiner.
Firefighters called to the scene by a neighbor found the home engulfed in flames and battled the blaze for about an hour as the home burned down to the frame, said Mike Lindbery, spokesperson for the Ventura County Fire Protection District.
“On arrival the fire was out of all the doors and windows,” he said.
The intensity of the fire may have destroyed any clues to what started it.
“I have doubts about whether we will find the cause because of the extent of the damage to the structure. It was down to rubble,” Lindbery said.
No firefighters were injured during the ordeal, he added.
The fire was reported at 1:11 a.m. Minutes later, at 1:18 a.m., two fire engines arrived at the scene and two additional engines joined them in the next four minutes, said Bill Nash, spokesperson for the Ventura County Fire Department.
“About 30 firefighters were involved with fighting the fire, search and rescue, and protecting other nearby structures,” he said.
The blaze was knocked down at 2:12 a.m., Nash said.
Gellenbeck, a manager and resident at the mobile home park for 14 years, said he evacuated his home just before 2 a.m.
“My wife and I got our shoes on and hustled out,” he said. “By the time we got to the fire the flames were down. (The firefighters) told me that they came to protect the two homes (on either side) because her home was lost.”
Gellenbeck said it was the first fire in the community of 300 homes since it was built in 1972.
Margolis, who went by the name Diane, was born in Columbus, Ohio, and attended Fairfax High School in Los Angeles. She moved to the Conejo Valley 34 years ago. She had a son and daughter and two granddaughters.
Margolis’ daughter, who did not want her name published, described her mother as dynamic, outgoing, thoughtful, considerate, warm and generous.
“We’ve been hearing from folks that she would leave cards and flowers anonymously at people’s doors. She really wanted to touch people’s hearts,” she said.
And she loved old musicals and the beach, her daughter said.
“She loved Venice Beach. That was her favorite field trip,” she said. “She was very loved. She will be missed.”Sign in now to view, license and download this image or contact us to see this image without a watermark. Want to embed this image on a non-commercial website or blog? Learn more.

10 Symptoms of Alzheimer's Disease
10 Symptoms of Alzheimer's Disease
By Betty Weiss:
1. Memory loss: We all forget things sometimes, but then remember them later. But AD patients will not remember later, nor even remember that they forgot in the first place.
2. Difficulty performing familiar tasks: Ordinary things that were before always done automatically now become impossible. AD victims may forget how to use a fork or spoon, how to operate household appliances, or how to participate in lifelong hobbies.
3. Problems with language: Words elude AD patients, and they often use an incorrect, but close, word. "Car" becomes "bus." A toothbrush is "that thing for my mouth." The "computer" is a "phone." A "flower" is the "lawn."
4. Disorientation about time and place: AD sufferers are easily lost, especially when driving alone. They cannot find the bathroom in their own homes. Often they do now know where they are, how they got there, or how to get back home.
5. Poor or decreased judgment: Those who have AD often dress inappropriately for the weather, wear two or three shirts over pajamas, or underwear over street clothes. They give away large sums of money, especially to telemarketers or someone on TV.
6. Problems with abstract thinking: Numbers lose their value, so AD sufferers may forget how to make change or balance a checkbook.
7. Misplacing things: Things are often "hidden" and impossible to find. Other people are frequently accused of stealing missing items.
8. Changes in mood or behavior: AD patients can swing from happy to sad, rapidly and for no apparent reason.
9. Changes in personality: AD sufferers may become suspicious and fearful. They may turn dependent, usually upon the one person who is closest to them.
10. Loss of initiative: Patients often become very passive, unable or unwilling to do normal activities, or sleeping the time away.
If any of this is familiar, see a doctor as soon as possible. However, not every physician can recognize the disease. If you are unhappy with one doctor's treatment, get a second or third opinion. Try to find a geriatrics doctor or a neurologist, as they often have more training and experience with the elderly or with brain conditions.
A diagnosis of "probable" Alzheimer's is confusing and terrifying. How can it be "probable"? It either is or it isn't -- isn't it? While AD is usually diagnosed by eliminating everything else that may be causing the symptoms, that diagnosis is only accurate about 85 percent of the time. AD can only be 100 percent verified through a brain biopsy during autopsy, hence the "probable" qualifier. There is, so far, no cure and no prevention.
This is not to say that all hope is lost. Most of the time AD is very slow-progressing, and there are usually many, many years of happy, normal living after diagnosis. The average lifetime after diagnosis is usually seven years, but others have lived for 25 years or more.

It's a sad....but sometimes comical disease. My grandfather has it, and sometimes the stuff he'd say makes me laugh, even though it's sad when you think about it.E-Pharm Nutrition Representative

Slab City Riot
myself, Riki, Allen, Kevin & Dean left for Temecula friday afternoon. we went to the pre party, but it was over by the time we got there, so we hit a bar & had some margarita's. we met up with Caleb, Paul & Stu saturday morning for the ride to Slab City. we thought we'd catch up with the wuss ride, but Riki had some malfuntions with his pack job. so we took the 79 south through Barrago Springs & rode through the desert to Niland. the weather was perfect & the scenery was awesome. we got to the Slab City Riot around 5pm. we set up camp over by Dan & his wife Tiffany. I guess we didn't realize it at the time, but we set up in some sexy lady's front yard by the name of Honey Pot. she was quite special & couldn't resist showing us her "honey pot" all nite & the next morning. Stu got her # & promised her more than he can deliver, but that's what being a bad ass biker is all about. our horse Kevin won the Coctagon & a cool $500 for his welts & scrapes. that's a pic of Mcgoo passing out the weapons for the main event. once again another great time on my knuckle & can't wait for the EDR next year.

Thursday, November 4, 2010An amazing experience! A night ride which we started at 21.00 leaving London fields, and arriving on Dunwich beach the next morning. 116 miles plus a 10 mile involuntary detour with a friendly chicken in tow.
Waiting in the Park for everyone to arrive. Getting there an 1hr earlier than everyone else wasn't my best move. Too much time to think about the journey ahead.
Catching a bit of cricket while waiting. That is in fact his real hair.
The RAGE looking syched!
The Starting Line!
'Pub in the Park', London fields. A few people were tucking into a last pint just before setting off.
Early Days.
All the lads looking rather cheery. I think we had only done about 20 odd miles at this point. TUCK IN MATE!
The sun rising.
This was a pretty special moment, after cycling in darkness for the last 5 hours.
Probably the happiest I've felt from seeing a sign. It felt like a pretty damn long 7 miles though.
Seeek, Stoked bro! Jono looking a bit chuffed.
Made it!
Some of the guys not looking to bad considering the length of the cycle and lack of sleep.
After this it was a little dip in the sea, a bacon sarnie and then an egg sarnie and a little snooze before the coach trip back.
Using file templates in NetBeans 6.0: Customizing author in generated files
By potociar on Sep 14, 2007
Whenever you ask NetBeans to create a new file (such as Java class or interface or an XML file) for you, it internally uses respective file template to generate the file content for you. This is particularly useful as it relieves you from a need to write boilerplate text, that may in case of Java files include things like package name, class definition, basic documentation (including author name) or a license text.[Read More]For immediate release

You couldn’t swing a 100-year-old cat statue without hitting an antique shop.
Turns out that Northern Indiana, while spoiled for antique choices, has got nothing on Wayne County. It turns out they have more than 1,200 (yes, you read that right: twelve hundred) antique dealers along two loop trails. Whether you want antique firearms, rare books, glassware, and other items “of a certain age,” you need to head to East Central Indiana.
Nancy Sartain, the Leisure Marketing Director of Wayne County’s Convention and Tourism Bureau, said that Cambridge City, just a few miles west of Richmond on US 40, has more than 10 new antique shops and malls within a 2 block area alone.
You can find a listing of the shops and antique malls on the Visit Richmond website, as well as maps of the two trails, and even some overnight packages for the truly intrepid and hard-core antiquers.
And while you’re in Richmond, check out their Tiffany stained glass windows. Nancy said, “only a handful of churches in America can claim the complete Tiffany-designed look of Richmond’s Reid Memorial Presbyterian Church. All 62 windows were crafted in New York by Louis Comfort Tiffany Studios.” You’ll also want to check out the Morrisson Reeves Library, St. Paul’s Episcopal Church and First Presbyterian Church.How to Clean Silk Plants
Casa Quickie: Silks Hit the Shower
Like us on Facebook
As much as I disapprove of faux fleurs, I must say . . . nothing blows the cover of silk plants more than a layer of dirt and grime on the leaves. Problem is, the pricey impostors are nearly impossible to keep clean. Who has the time to dust each and every leaf? I sure don't. One easy solution for sprucing up any fake plants in your pad is to simply run them under a cold shower (hot water could melt the glue) for a few seconds. Just take it out of the planter (or hold the planter), put it under the water until it seems clean, shake off the excess, let it dry naturally, and voilà — a clean and (semi-)realistic looking botanical once again. Want to know another secret? I use the same technique to clean off my real houseplants!

Mixed Vista Quality Report
While Windows Vista is only weeks from completion, reports are now surfacing that Microsoft's future OS may have significant problems above and beyond typical first-release copies, according to ZDNet's Mary Jo Foley. Citing premier developer Sandro Villinger, Foley notes that the user interfance consistency and speed fall short of what would be expected in a shipping copy.
"My computer has a 4.2 rating and a GeForce 7800 which should be enough to run some of those [visual] effects. [However,] even one of the fastest machines out there needs almost two seconds to open Control Panel and even one to two (seconds) to go to the Security section," Villinger says.
Other high-priority testers observe that even official Microsoft programs, such as Live Meeting 2005, still don't work properly with Vista while a lack of drivers persists in this late stage. Regardless, some of these same critics argue that the OS will be ready in time for manufacturing in November, pointing out that many companies withhold drivers and software updates for a new Windows version until it ships. "XP shippped with issues that they fixed later on," says tester Brandon LeBlanc. Vista will only be available to the public at large in January 2007.There are currently no items in your cart.

Background
16 Communities, 37 Million People. One Goal
Aligning Forces for Quality (AF4Q) was the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation’s 16 geographically, demographically, and economically diverse communities participating in AF4Q together covered 12.5 percent of the U.S. population.
What we do
Can bringing together the people who give care, get care, and pay for care improve quality in America? AF4Q communities proved it can.
After eight years, AF4Q communities have built transformative partnerships, often where none existed before:
- Data on quality, cost, and patient experience measures are being collected and publicly reported;
- Practice coaches are deployed in hundreds of primary care practices;
- Hospitals are improving care from emergency department to bedside;
- Patients are playing a crucial part in transforming health care;
- New models for care delivery and organization are being tested and implemented; and
- Innovative payment reform is becoming a reality.
Aligning Forces for Quality proved that by working together—we can solve some of the most vexing problems of our health care system.Demonstrating the Christie Administration’s commitment to advancing the arts in New Jersey, the New Jersey State Council on the Arts has awarded more than $529,000 in grants to Union County arts organizations. 5 million visitors who spend another $125 million.:

Sermonizing signs
Given the prevalence of digital trickery in photographs, I’m not quite sure I believe that all the church signs on Asylum.com are legitimate (especially the Catholic church message that reads, “Staying in bed, shouting Oh God! does not constitute going to church”), but they are fun to contemplate, nevertheless.
An Internet search reveals several sites that let you generate your own church signs. Access it by clicking here. (It’s where the photo at the top of this entry came from.)

Lighting blues
I just came down off the roof.
No, I wasn’t contemplating suicide. I was hanging Christmas lights. Which might be the same thing, come to think of it.
I started Friday afternoon. After running three sets around the top of our porch (which I access by climbing out a second-story window), I realized I had started with the wrong end, meaning that I ended with a female plug where I desperately needed a male. (That’s the first time I can say that.) After restringing the strands, I found two of them wouldn’t light, even though they had worked flawlessly in a test on the ground.
By this point, the sun was down and I was feeling the cold. I adjourned to Wal-Mart (the second time that day) and bought new lights. Today, I hung them and — so far, at least — they all work. A little wrapping with electrical tape to keep everything secure and the task is done.
Best of all, while I labored on the roof, Holly and Malori (with help from my niece) assembled the Christmas tree in the living room. This is the most odious of all holiday tasks and one that I am always pleased to wriggle out from whenever possible. I still have to string lights around it and help hang bulbs, but as far as actual assembly goes, my role was limited to dragging the tree box down from the attic. And that’s just how I like it.
Not for nothing am I called the “Christmas Brat.” All this fuss and bother for one day, and by the time it arrives, everybody’s too tired and stressed to enjoy it. Bah, humbug.

Killing dragons
My daughter wrote a paper about medieval dragons recently, which got me thinking about Dragonslayer, a 1981 offering from Paramount and Disney. I had the DVD tucked away for about a year, but had never opened it. Imagine my surprise upon watching it to discover that I had never seen it before, despite having vivid memories of certain scenes.
The false memories are easy to explain.

Hallelujah
The unbridled cry of joy you may have heard at around 5 p.m. Sunday in the vicinity of South Arch Avenue in Alliance was me, crowing over the completion of a term paper.
The assignment itself wasn’t any big deal — a ten-page examination of some aspect of Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales — but I’d built it up in my mind into something much bigger, until it loomed like Mt. Everest

Talking turkey about a discredited bird
Here is my print column from Nov. 20, 2008:
If Ben Franklin had succeeded in enshrining the turkey as our national bird, would we be eating eagle on Thanksgiving?
It’s one of life’s little imponderables. Either way, the turkey is a bird that needs some positive PR. Unlike beef and chicken, it has no fast-food representation. There is no McTom, no BK Gobbler, no Turkey McNuggets value meal.
Instead, the language is rife with negative turkey connotations. Everybody’s dated at least one turkey, and

Drac at AHS
On Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, Alliance High School presents Dracula on the auditorium stage. Showtime each night is 7:30 p.m. My colleague James Ballor and I are co-advisers of the production. The eight actors and student director have knocked themselves out to create a fun rendition of the world-famous vampire play, as it’s known. We’ve mixed some high-tech effects (a computer-generated bat silhouette, some screen grabs) with old-fashioned scares.
Anyway, technical and dress rehearsals are going to keep me from posting here over the weekend, and some work-related duties plus a paper I need to write for a class I’m taking will keep me from blogging for a few weeks after that. I’ll still post my weekly print columns here, but that will be all through the end of the month, unless some time I’m not expecting suddenly becomes available.
Meanwhile, if you’re around Alliance this weekend, pay your $5 ($4 if you’re a student) and come see Dracula sink his fangs into unsuspecting victims.

Fat Flash
The October 26 Funky Winkerbean strip was a clever parody of an old Flash comic-book cover. Flash was always beset upon by super-villains who transformed him in strange ways: Fattening him up (as is the case with this cover), making him slow, old, different shades of violet.
Anyway, the original cover that inspired cartoonist Tom Batiuk is reprinted above: Flash #115. Note the purple-clad bad guy in the background whose diabolical weapon has made the Flash look like a refugee from a Richard Simmons episode.

Grail search
I’ve never seen Monty Python and the Holy Grail all the way through until this weekend. It’s a lot of fun. “Inspired lunacy,” as one quote puts it. The Black Knight, the killer bunny, the hilarious question-and-answer game on the bridge — it’s all timeless humor, as fresh today as it was in the early ’70s. I showed my senior English class some snippets on Friday. They laughed. Highly recommended.American Toad Calling
It is Spring time here in North Carolina, and the warm weather has brought the toads back out from their burrows, and they have come out of hibernation. The American toad, as well as other frogs , have one thing on their mind after they come out of hibernation ,that is reproduction. The male toads call for the females, and the female toads select the males with the loudest calls as their mate. I took this video on the bank of a pond behind my house. Below we see a male American toad who has climbed onto the back of a female who he has attracted with his calls. When a male assumes this position it is called amplexus, which is a fancy word for mating position. As the female releases her eggs into the water in a long string ,then the male fertilizes them. I took this video and photo with a Canon Rebel T4i and Canon 100mm Macro lens. For the lighting I used a Newer CN-160 led light pod mounted to the top of my camera. Now that the weather is warm, and the frogs and toads have come back out and I am working on some documentary clips about frogs and toads of North Carolina.

Spy Clip - Face OffThe Natural Birth Community is quick to say, “Don’t do it! You can do it without it! An Epidural is dangerous! It is evil and causes problems!” Mostly, this is true. You CAN do it naturally and Epidurals do come with risks to mom and baby.
There are studies, personal experiences and more that show Epidurals are a drug, has risks, and effect the mother’s body and the newborn as such. They also can slow down labor and be the beginning of a cascade of interventions. If you didn’t want pitocin, constant monitoring, not being able to move around, etc., those options are no longer yours. Epidurals often lead to purple pushing, tearing, episiotimies and cesarean births.
That is all true.
As you can see though, I linked to information about Epidurals and their risks. I will not go over that here. This is not another blog post to tell you how horrible you are if you birthed your little one with an Epidural.
Is the Epidural always evil? Is there never a good use for one? Just like with any allopathic remedy or intervention, it is there for a reason..
Here are a few examples when an Epidural is a blessing to a mother.
Mom has become too exhausted. She has had a long labor and has become too tired and can not rest. In this case, an epidural may help her to get the rest she needs. Her uterus can still contract and baby can move down the birth canal. It is a better outcome than an unnecessary surgery. It would be best to help ensure mom gets adequate rest when she can during labor to prevent exhaustion from occurring.
Malposition of baby. When a baby is not in an ideal position it can cause a very painful, long labor. It may become difficult for mom to relax as baby tries to turn with the contractions. I’ve been there…twice. It’s so painful. I got an epi with one and did not with the other. Optimally, mom will do what she can during pregnancy to help baby find a great position. There are also things you can do with your midwife or OB in labor to help baby shift (hands and knees rocking, etc).
Fear. Yes, that is a valid reason for an Epidural. If a mother can not work through her fears in pregnancy and they are carried over into her labor, her uterus will not have the blood supply it needs and may not be able to work at its best. This also causes a great deal of pain. There is more information about this in the book, Hypnobirthing, the Mongan Method. Having an epidural will allow the woman’s body to do its job without her fear (mind) getting in the way. Of course it would be wonderful if all women could Birth Without Fear, but that is not the real world.
Lack of support. I truly hope all women will have the support she needs to birth so that this is not an issue. However, if she doesn’t she may find that she needs an epidural to be calm and birth.
Any situation where it helps avoid an unnecessary cesarean section.
A Cesarean Birth (instead of a spinal).
Remember, each woman, pregnancy, labor and birth are unique. I know this is not a popular view on Epidurals in the Natural Birth World, but it is reality.
Please, if you are researching Epidurals, use the links I’ve given in this post. Try to do what you can to avoid your chances of needing an Epidural.
Sometimes though, it can’t be avoided and that is OK. That is what it is there for. It is my hope that women can work through fears, have the right support and be able to avoid an unnecessary Epidural. However, the Big Bad Epidural is not always evil.

Definitely not always evil, I was just talking to my bestie. She is planning on trying to have her first in a few years after losing some weight. She knows I had my dd all naturally. And while she would love to do that she is just not a person who handles pain well at all. She actually had an IUD put in yesterday and she had to be fully put to sleep for it. While she would love to do it all naturally, she already knows that an epidural is what is best for her and her baby!
Having an IUD put in is WAY the hell different than giving birth. I had an endometrial biopsy recently and just about passed out from the pain. Doc said most folks hardly even feel it. However, I gave birth at home naturally with very little issue.
I would never advise that a person actually PLAN for an epidural; that’s like planning for it to be too painful to handle, but the birth culture being the sad, awful, frightening thing it is in hospitals these days, I don’t blame women for needing help.
I got an epi with my son because I was feeling pushy when I was only 5cm. HOLY OW. It was great because I was able to rest until I needed to push, and he was out in 15 minutes. In that situation, I’d do it again in a heartbeat.
I was only in labor for 6 hours but i did get an epi and im not ashamed of it. i had been 4cm for almost 4 weeks before i had my water broken at the hospital. as soon as my water broke i started having stronger contractions back to back and was growing weak and the pain would cause my to tighten my body instead of relax it. i asked for an epidural at 5cm and then i was laughing through contractions! i was able to relax and take a nap and by the time i was checked i was fully dilated. the epidural took my pain which allowed me to relax my body and let it push my baby girl out on its own when i felt the urge to push 30mins later i was allowed crowing! my daughter was out in 20 minutes after 6 hours of labor :). i would do it all over again if i had too. i actualy say i rather push her out over and over again then breastfeed her. haha
Love this post! Thank you! I had an epidural after 3 days of induction for bad PIH and I simply couldn’t handle it anymore. I did end up with a c-section but believe I would have whether or not I had the epidural. Round 2 this time and I am trying for a HBAC with no signs of PIH yet! Thanks again!
I was one of those mamas who needed the epi to relax. I had really hard back labor due to a posterior baby and after 12 hours I was nearly passing out with each contraction. I’d been stuck at 4cm for a few hours. I got the epi and within 20 min I jumped to 8cm. It did it’s job. Now I just hope I don’t need it at all next time.
Back labor is evil! lol I had back labor for over a week with my son (he was posterior) before I was finally admitted to the hospital. I basically lived in my bath tub, was 5cm when I arrived at the hospital. My 2nd labor, no back labor this time, was amazing! My first ended up in an emergency c-section due to cord prolapse.
Your birth experience sounds very similar to mine! The back labor drained me physically and mentally. I was to the point where I was falling asleep seconds after each contraction would end, and waking up in pure terror from the sudden pain. I do feel though that if I had more support (such as a doula or two, a birthing suite with a tub) that I may have been able to it naturally. However, plain and simple, I didn’t. I still had a great birth experience given the entire situation.
Thank you BWF for posting this article. In some mama-groups there is some shame that goes along with an epi, it’s good to remember that there is a time and place for everything, and that every birth is different!
Thank you, thank you for this post. I wanted a drug-free labor. I planned for it. I read books. I researched. Then, after I had been in labor for over 24 hours and dilated to 8, I decided to get an epidural. I was able to rest, for which I am thankful, because I pushed for three hours. I was pushing correctly, but it just took that long. Part of me feels a little sad that I could not reach my initial goal, but my baby was born healthy and looked straight into my eyes as soon as she was born. Really, that’s most important to me anyway.
Eventhough we took Bradley classes and wanted an intervention free birth for our first (DD 3mos old), I labored w/o anything for 12 hours overnight in the hospital (very supportive RN’s and OBGYN), but by the time 8am rolled around, we talked about it as an option. I had been up all night, and by 5:30 am, I was so tired that I fell asleep through intense contractions for about an hour. I woke up in a fog, and something told me that I needed help. I tried not to feel like a failure. The last thing I wanted was to be so tired that my Doc would threaten a C-section….It ended up being the right decision for us…
I got the epidural, my husband and I had them put it on the lowest possible dose, and I slept for 3 hours. I woke up feeling great, so we turned the epidural off! By then I was fully dilated, and actually felt like I wanted to push. 40 min later, I had a beautiful baby in my arms! I felt her come out and everything!! I still want my home birth the next time around!!!
I had a rockin’ water birth with #2, but with #1, I didn’t. Because I was AFRAID. Knowing the epi was available helped me not to fear labor and birth.
Part of me wishes I’d done it differently, but I know…that’s just not “where I was” at the time. I made the decision that really seemed best at the time, based on my experience and, yes, my fear. I’m SO glad that I was at a totally different place with the second, and that I could have such an amazing natural birth. But I actually did have a really great medicated birth the first time, and I’m glad that I had a “tool” to deal with my fear…even if my “tool” (an epidural) isn’t one I’d choose again.
I feel similarly about my first. I had an epidural partially because they gave me pitocin and I knew I wanted one if I was going to have the pit. Part of me wishes that I had known I didn’t have to do that. I could have waited, let me body take care of it, and done it on my own. But I was terrified of labor with my first because I was not educated enough, because that’s what happens in this country, and that’s just where I was at the time too. With my 2nd I had an all natural birth.
I have ran the gauntlett when it comes to birth it seems. I have had a c/s with no trial of labor. I had an unmedicated VBAC (homebirth transfer) and an induced labor with an epidural this last time. There is a time and place for help. I love the point of making your own peace with that as a woman and doing what is best for you with each labor and delivery with out fear. <3
I really like this post. My EDD is March 28th, its my first baby, AFTER finding your blog, I decided to go the natural route, and switched from and OB to a CNM, at my last appointment she said something about Epidurals that made a lot of sense to me…
” There is a different between the pain of laboring, and actually suffering, only if I see that you are truly suffering, will I offer pain medication”
A reason that may not occur at first, because it is something we hate to think about is if the mom is delivering a still baby. I did all the right things, took all right pills, ate all the right food, but because of a cord accident my Asher died just after my water broke. It was no fault of any person…. just an act of God or some would say a fluke. I labored naturally in and out of the shower for 6 hours (not long as far as labor is concerned, I know) and when I reached my own breaking point I was already 8cm. I asked for that epidural, and by the time it was administered and took effect I was already 10cm. 10mins later my son’s body was in my arms. I didn’t have much in the way of support simply because no one knew what to do for me. And honestly I don’t know that I’d have let anyone into my heart and head at that time anyway. But having the blessing of that epidural right at the end allowed me to be able to focus on my son, and not on any after-pains or things like that. It is also what allowed me to sleep when I was finally alone hours later because it still hadn’t fully worn off. That epidural was a good thing that day.
I am so sorry for you loss Samantha and you bring up something I did not think of. Thank you for sharing your story and insight.
Same reason i chose an epidural, for our still daughter. I completely understand. I am so sorry for you Samantha <3.
Thank you both. I am one who will shout to the heavens about all the bad an epidural can do… but for some moms, at some times, the epi is needed relief. And Reannan, I’m so sorry for your loss… my heart always breaks for those who fight the same battle as me. <3
Thank you for showing the good side of the “Big Bad Epi” as well.
I had one with the birth of my son (who is my first) & had planned on one with my daughter – but she had other plans. And looking back, I’m SO GLAD she did! After laboring only two hours (contractions were strongish, regular, and worse when I moved), we headed to the hospital, two hours away. Well, I hit transition when I was about 5 mins away! So by the time they got me to L&D, I was pushing & just hadn’t known it. All I knew was it HURT so I was vocal about it! Of course, by the time I was on the bed & out of my bottoms, it was too late for an epi & out she shot.
Now I’ve done the research and will never have an unnecessary epi again – because giving birth under my own will, strength, and power was about the greatest experience of my life! This is NOT to say all of them are bad/wrong…as you stated, every woman, & even every pregnancy is different – as such, they need different sorts of handling. Congrats to all you mamas who worked so hard, even though you had an epidural!
Great article! Love this: .” I wrote an article on a similar topic recently: Do Doulas Trust Women? You can find it here:
I had intended to labor without any drugs whatsoever, and I almost made it! I lost my plug the day before my due date, and I was so excited that I could not rest at all. So when I went into labor at ten that night, I was in for the long haul. I made it to 8.5 cm naturally, but I had been up for 24 hours at that point and knew I was too exhausted to push when the time came. I’m glad I had the epidural, but I am hoping to go natural next time!
It makes me angry that epidurals are thought of as purely evil. I ended up having to be induced – something I did not plan. I got an epidural when I was 8cm dilated and had the most positive birth experience I could have possibly hoped for! I felt calm, centered, and very present. I was able to feel everything. The pain was not totally gone but it was not mind-numbing and I felt every contraction and could push really well because I felt them. I pushed for only 1 hour 40 minutes, which isn’t so bad for a first birth. My baby was very energetic, looked me right in the eyes, and started breastfeeding immediately. We never had any problems with breastfeeding, and we’re going on strong 2 months later. I never had any side effects as far as I could tell either. I know it will always differ by person, but I want people to know it doesn’t always have to be the end of all positivity. I feel proud of my birth and my baby is doing so well today.
I had an epi with both my girls.
Both times, my water broke and I never went into labor at all, after hours of waiting. I ended up with pitocin both times.
For my first, I really wanted to go “natural” but the pain was so excruciating with the pitocin that I asked for relief. I went from no labor/contractions at all, to baby born in about 5 hours after the pitocin started. The second time around, I knew my body better and knew how fast I would go once the pitocin started. Sure enough, four hours after the drip, baby was delivered. I went from 2.5 cm to 10 in that short time! Because I had already surrendered the idea of a “natural” birth once pitocin began, my only goal was to be happy and enjoy my birth, not be in agonizing, fearful pain.
My epi did not numb me. I still had pain, I still felt the pushes, and still had to breathe through it. It just took the edge off the crazy pitocin.
If I have another child, I will have the baby at home and deal with everything in the most natural way possible. I would love an opportunity at a fully “normal” birth someday.
I couldn’t agree more. I had my VBAC this past March, and decided after about 60 hours of labor to get the epidural. My water broke at 5am, and my contractions started back-to-back and strong (posterior baby here, too) around noon. I got the epidural that night, and got my first rest in 3 days. By the time I started pushing at 3:15am, it had worn off quite a bit and I could feel everything. It was a wonderful experience for me, and I think it actually kept me from a c-section. After such a long labor and my water being broken for so long, the fact that my body wasn’t progressing past 5 was a serious concern. The epidural allowed me to relax some and I progressed to 8 within the next 2 hours. I was pushing 2 hours later. At first I was disappointed with asking for the epidural, but once I looked back at it without my natural-birth “epis are evil and for the weak” mindset, I realized that it was a WONDERFUL thing I was able to get that rest, allow my body to progress, and then be able to be present for my son’s birth. While I hope to birth naturally at home next time around, I no longer have regret for this choice. Great blog post, as usual!
I have found as a midwife that up to 20% of first-time moms “need” an epidural. When I say “need” I mean that they are more helpful than harmful and contribute to a better birth than she might have otherwise had. A typical scenario is as you have described: a mom has had a long labor and is exhausted, and her labor has slowed down enough to become ineffective but not enough to give her good rest so she can recharge. At times it becomes counterproductive to continue to strive for a “natural” birth when an epidural-pitocin combination could be exactly what this mom needs in order to have a vaginal birth in the end. I learned the hard way that the difference between a vaginal birth and a c-section sometimes lies in my hands as I discern when to suggest a transport; wait too long, and you sometimes have reduced options. Interestingly, as often as I have come across the exhausted primip (first-time mom) sort of scenario, I have never yet come across a situation where a multip (a mom who has had a baby before) “needed” an epidural.
I did have a multip who needed an epidural. This was baby #5, and I had been supporting mom as her doula for baby #4, so she was a repeat client. Baby #4 was born VERY QUICKLY and though it seemed that mom had coped beautifully/done a great job (from my vantage point) what was not apparent to me until labor with baby #5 was that she had been traumatized during that birth. So much so that she insisted on an epidural for #5 in order to be more “in control” of the birth process. This from a lady who had experienced natural birth in the past! Even her (female) OB (whose style is much more like a midwife) was encouraging her to just hang on for a few minutes. OB even offered (at 7 cm) to break her water, saying to her: You’ll open right up, baby will come right down and you will have this baby in 15 minutes. Nothing doing! Mom really really really really really really wanted an epidural. So she got it. And labor slowed/stalled. And then she got an itty bit of pit. And there she stayed. At 7 cm. So OB suggested breaking her water and having a baby (again) and that’s the way it played. When it was over the OB whispered to me: I wanted to do that HOURS AGO!. But apparently, mom needed the epidural. No amount of coaching, reassurance, cajoling, etc would do what pharmaceuticals could for this lady. I was truly humbled that day and learned an important lesson too!
I needed an epidural with my second. After a beautiful medication free birth experience with my daughter that only lasted 7 hours start to finish I was prepared to do the same with my son. My contractions with him started at around 7 am. They were five minutes apart and 1.5 minutes long. They continued steady that way until my water broke naturally at 11 pm. By the time I finally got the epidural at 6:30 am I had been up and laboring nearly 24 hours, the baby was positioned and not descending (and no positioning was helping) and my bp was 160/120. All involved agreed an epidural was the best course of action, and though I’ve spent the last year coming to terms with it, I now believe that I could never had my son vaginally without the epidural.
My son was born in October, I fully intended to have a home water birth, but after 70 hours of labor and staying at 8cm for over 14 hours my husband and I made the tough decision to transfer to the hospital. I bawled when I realized we were going to have to go to the hospital. I labored there, with terrible back labor, for another 5 hours before getting an epidural. At which point my husband and midwife advised I get it. I was terribly exhausted after having been unable to sleep for 3 days. I was literally falling asleep while sitting on the birthing ball. It was awful. After getting the epidural I slept for 7 hours before delivering my son. The epidural allowed me to sleep, so I would be able to push him out, and it helped my son turn, he was face up. As soon as my son was born he was a little lethargic, I immediately felt guilt for my choice to have an epidural. That is the one thing I would say is “bad” about these pro home birth circles, they can be a little judgmental. Not all are that way, but each group does seem to have it’s members that are that way. My son ended up being fine, started screaming and crying after a couple minutes. I still struggle a bit with the feelings of guilt over getting the epidural. I don’t know what I would have done without the support of my husband. He was saying as we left the hospital that if I wanted to we could try the home water birth with our next baby. His support was so amazing. My husband worded it this way, we got pregnant to have a wonderful baby, not to have this amazing birth experience, we got what we wanted. No I didn’t get to have the birth experience I wanted but maybe next time, for now I will just snuggle my baby boy and be thankful I didn’t have to have a c-section, and that I have a healthy, chubby, wonderful baby. And I will hope and pray that my next baby can be born at home. I would just urge others to not be judgmental about how women give birth. There is a lot of pressures that come with being a new mom, your judgement is not helpful at all. Some women already struggle with PPD (thankfully I didn’t) feeling guilt about how their labor and delivery ended up going only adds to that.
This sounds very similar to the birth experience I had with my first. My son was posterior and I labored at home with my midwives for 36 hours, stuck at 3 cm and unable to hold down even a teaspoon of fluid without vomiting from the pain. I wish I had been praised for my decision to get the 5 hours of rest that epidural gave me (and the strength it gave me to push him out!). It would have saved me months of guilt and self-doubt afterward.
Thank you for writing this. This is the exact attitude I think that everyone should have about options for moms giving birth. Yes, a lot of people could do it without – but for some people, it’s a good option or necessary, just like a lot of other things.
I was dead-set against having an epidural and was able to deliver my children drug-free. That being said – the reason I didn’t want the epi? I WAS MORE afraid of the “big bad epidural” than I was about giving birth! The idea of having a Csection was so frightening. My first daughter was a 36 hour labor -looooong. I wish that they would come up with something better and safer for moms. I think if I had more options I would have loved to have a little relief from such a long labor. But I also did self-hypnosis and it really did help. And it would have been nice to feel more rested to take care of my new baby.
Never once have I felt “judgy” about a woman having an epidural-we all need to do what’s right for us! I just wish we had better, safer options for pain management in birth.
I felt the same way! I don’t regret my L&D experience, but 36 hours of active labor was a hard road, and I think that part of what stalled me was the fear of “what if I need an epi / pain meds / a c-section?”. I was very caught up in trying to avoid any of that, and it did create some unnecessary anxiety.
I was dead set on not having an epidural. I wanted to to it all natural, and starting out, it looked like i would be able to, but then the pain got so bad, i couldnt handle it. They had to give me oxygen to regulate my breathing and then they told me her heart rate was slowing. To me, i had to do it to calm myself down, so i would stop freaking her out. The crazy thing is, once i laid back down from getting the epi, i had to start pushing because i was fully dialated! a little longer and i could have done it all natural, but i didnt want to take that chance. next time will be different though
This is an amazing post. I was very young and very uneducated about birth when I had my first. I was induced at almost 42 weeks and he was just shy of 9lbs. I had went over 24hrs, and on maybe an hours sleep. I was exhausted and I had reached my breaking point. I had an epidural at 6cm and got about 4 hours of sleep. I woke up aid I had to push and in 7 pushes he was out.
With my younger 2 I had one in a 6 hour all natural labor and our youngest was also all natural, but he wasnt positioned correctly. I pulled through but it was exhausting and I was drained after wards. We had our time, then my fiance went and got our older 2 and after maybe 3 hours everyone had came to see us welcome him and went home. Then it was just us and our baby.
I was glad I went epi free with the last two, but I think I would have been very terrified if I hadnt gotten it the first time. I am a teen mom, so I feel it helped and as I grew and became more educated with our other children I am 100% satisfied with our decisions, even though I at one point in the younger ones labors, asked for an epidural but the boys decided thats not what they wanted because within 30mins of asking both times they were in my arms.
I had epidurals with all three births. Three different hospitals. All three epidurals did not work. No one can explain to me why epidurals do not work on me. They just numbed me about half way. I still felt excruciating pain.
Same thing with me. Dont work well. I could still move my legs and felt everything!
I hear ya. With my son I was in labor for 28 hours. He was just not COMING OUT! I was having all back labor and was unable to relax enough to dilate. My doctor gave me two options 1) Try epidural or 2) Have a C-section. I obviously chose #1, then I finally started to dilate and was able to birth him vaginally. I am glad that it worked for me, but I chose it as a last resort. I am just glad I got to avoid having major surgery!
Just like with c-sections, epirdurals are sometimes necessary, but the use is abused. They should only be provided out of medical necessity. (extreme fatigue from days of labor, etc)
As a midwife, when the call is made for a transport (non-emergency) I tell mom’s that an epidural may be the difference between a vaginal birth and a section. That is a fact! I don’t presume to tell anyone what they can and can’t do in their own birth, so I will openly and willingly drag in the anesthesiologist if that’s what the mom wants
As a mother of 4, I’ve given birth with 2 of them. My first was a 3 day, posterior, no progression past 3 cm, with pitocin … I opted for an epidural about 12 hours before she was born. I feel that is what kept me from having a section with my first birth. I was able to relax, sleep, have my body labor the baby down so I could have my baby, who was still posterior
Thank you so much for this post. I have always felt so guilty about having an epidural. I was 10 days overdue. My baby was HUGE, and I went into Labor on a Thursday afternoon, and he wasn’t born until Saturday night. After 32 hours of active labor with no interventions, I needed to relax, and get the baby out. At the 53 hour mark I gave birth to a 9 pound baby boy, with a huge head. Without the epidural I would have had a c-section, which I was very against. So again, thank you for your post.
Thank you for this post. I have been feeling guilty since my last birth! After four all natural births, I opted last minute for an epidural. I was an induction with slow to no progression. The pain of pitocin contractions was intense but after the epi, I was ready to push in 20 minutes! I know what one is like now too and can be more objective in talking to others about the experience.
I REALLY appreciate this post.
I read this website a lot because I’m so terrified of birth. I’m a FTM and even the strep B test swab hurt me. I’m 36 weeks pregnant and after that swab making me cry out, I can’t even imagine a cervix check… Much less full on labor!
I obviously don’t handle pain well. I know my body is capable of amazing things, but my mind right now is not in a place to let it. I LOVE reading natural birth stories, and looking at pictures of home birth, but I KNOW I want pain meds. I just do. I’m too scared, and have spent my entire pregnancy trying to get over it and I just can’t.
Sometimes I feel AWFUL for wanting pain meds because I’m so scared, and a lot of natural birth sites make you feel like absolute crap for wanting one… and it sucks.
I appreciate the middle ground in this post. It’s amazing. Thank you.
I was really trying to go epidural free with both of my babies but as it turns out…my body does not go into labor on its own and I don’t dialate properly without one. With my first I was induced and struggled(drug free) for 10 hours to get to 3cm. 4 hours after I got the epidural I was fully dialated and ready to go! This time around I was 4cm dialated for a week thinking I would go into labor at any minute. My water broke but I failed to go into labor for 24 hours resulting in another induction. This time my doc put me on the lowest dose of pitocin but had to shut it off after my body had a massive freakout resulting in a 10 minute long contraction (no pain meds) 5 hours later I had only progressed 1cm. I went with the epidural..and imagine my nurses shock when she checked me 45 minutes later and I was fully dialated and ready to push! Needless to say I tried to avoid the epidural for as long as I possibly could knowing all the risks to my myself and my babies but as it turns out avoiding the epidural has only done me more harm than good. Next time I will go for the epidural as soon as I can rather than put it off and deal with the pain and getting nowhere;)
Good article. To use an epidural or not is a personal choice. Either way doesn’t make you a bad mother. The most important thing is to understand what epidural is, how it works and what risks and benefits it carries. In short, the risks of labor epidural are very low. However the choice is personal and must be made with full understanding of the procedure. After all labor pain has no benefits.
With my first, 32 hours into labor, and after hours of pitocin, my preeclampsia had sent my bp sky-high, so my midwife gave me the choice between the epidural or a c-section.
I cried, but in the end, it was the right choice for the situation. An epidural was a far better choice for me than a c-section.
I had an epidural only because I was at the hospital at 9:30 am and my son wasnt born until the next day at 1:02 am….after such a long day I needed to sleep. When it came time to push, I didn’t hit the button to release the medicine because I wanted to feel him come out.
I had always intended a natural birth and was especially opposed to induction and epidural. I ended up with a medically necessary induction due to Cholestasis. After contracting every 2 minutes on pit from 10am with a posterior baby I had only gotten to 4cm. I had almost reached the end of my endurance – especially given I had low energy from suffering from HG my whole pregnancy – and finally had an epidural at 1am. I truly believe that if I had not consented to an epidural that it would have ended in a c-section…i simply would not have had the energy to push, when the time came. I cried my eyes out the whole time they were putting it in but 3 hours later I was fully dilated and we had managed to make the baby turn and I was able to request they dial the epi back so that I could feel my contractions and push.
In my case it was Epidural or Csection and Epidural was the obvious choice for me.
I had a very traumatic birth with my first. Long labor, hardly any dilation, ended in a very unpleasant c-section. I was offered very little choice in anything that went on (or so I felt).
With my VBAC baby, I had an extremely long labor. I was “stuck” at about 5cm and was in a lot of pain and tired. My body was fighting the contractions. So I got the epi and I’m so glad I did. I got some sleep and my body stopped fighting the contractions because I was able to relax. It would have been nice to do it without pain meds, and I think it could have made my pushing stage shorter if I didn’t… but I honestly don’t know how I could have gotten to the pushing stage to begin with without my epidural. I loved it.
I forgot to add that one of the things that made me so happy with my epidural after my first birth experience was that it all ended up being my choice. And everything that happened during my second labor and delivery of my VBAC baby solidified my views that it’s so important for women to have a say about how they choose to birth. And mothers need to do what they need to do for themselves and their babies without judgment from others.
I had a 33 hour labor and made it over halfway before getting an epidural. I spent the entire time I was at the hospital at 3 cm. They put me on pitocin because I wasnt dilating, then I asked for Stadol, which helped me sleep through most of the night. As they continued to up the pitocin, the pain became too much for the Stadol to cover and I needed the epidural. I did dilate to 4 cm with the Stadol. I got the epidural and within a few hours I had dilated to 7, and next thing I knew (I slept when I could after the epidural) I felt pressure and was pushing and had him out within 20 minutes. The epidural helped me relax when I couldn’t. I spent the whole first half of my labor walking and bouncing on the birthing ball. I did everything I could to relax and move myself along. It just wasn’t happening. I was in the “epidurals are bad” camp before labor. Now I’m in the “epidurals are ok” camp. If you need one, it can be really helpful. If you can make it through labor without one, you should. I still am seeking a completely medication/intervention free birth. We’ll see what happens next time for me.
I think that many natural birthing proponents actually do a disservice to the cause by being negative about epidurals during labor. I was fortunate enough to be able to follow through with my plan for a natural, unmedicated birth that I was hoping for from the get-go – it is my belief that since women have been birthing this way for many generations, I can do it too. Many women don’t believe in this for themselves, so why shouldn’t they use what is available to them? The end result of labor and delivery is always healthy baby AND healthy mom, we should be supporting each other on how we get there, even if it isn’t the same way we would have chosen to get there for ourselves. I realize how many things can go wrong with having an epidural but delivering a baby is hard enough – the last thing a laboring mother needs to worry about is how she is viewed for having a baby the way she does.
Thank you so much for posting this! I was in labor for 2 days with my little one, during which time I did not sleep or eat. If I had not gotten an epidural so I could sleep for just 2 hours, they would have taken my baby by C-section. I didn’t like it, and I don’t want to have to do it again, but it does have its place.
Thank you for sharing this…
I just had my precious little angle baby, Ava Rei, on 3/13/13. I had a home birth plan. I labored for 24 hours at home and was stuck at 5cm dilation for 8 1/2 hours with constant pushing urges that are nearly impossible to stop or just pant/breathe through. Because of this my cervix got swollen and could not progress. I was then transferred to the hospital, where the CNM there spoke with me about the risks, and also the major benefit that Epidural would be for me at that time. If I would have not had the Epidural I would have continued to try not to push, but with no success, and I would have had to have a C-Section. After having the Epidural in for about 2-3 hours, my cervix was still not dilating so they spoke with me about Pitosin, and at that point I broke down and had a good cry, because none of this is what I wanted for my dear daughter or myself. However, the combination of the two helped get my baby into the world safely and vaginally, which ultimately was the most important thing.
I believe that if the body and baby are cooperating, you can certainly go without the Epidural and other interventions, which is exactly what I wanted to do. You just have to keep in mind that things don’t always go as planned, and we are lucky that there are things like these drugs to help when they are needed.
When I first found out I was pregnant, I was all for a natural birth plan. I thought in my mind that if my mom could do it then I totally could do it. But the difference between my mom and I is that she can handle pain way better than I could. I have many tattoos but they didn’t hurt nearly as bad as my birthing experience. When I went into labor, I had the worse back pain in the world. I couldn’t believe it. So that day I decided I wanted an Epidural. I was so afraid but the pain was just too much for me. Im just not one to handle it well. And I made the mistake and didn’t take any birthing classes because I just thought I could do it without. Well I got the Epidural and it took the contraction pain away but when I actually gave birth it was the worse pressure and pain I have ever felt. My daughter was face up and slightly looking to the right so I could definitely feel everything. I pushed for 5 hrs and she finally came out. I think that if I didn’t have the Epidural I probably would have passed out from the pain. I could still move my legs so it must have not been that strong of an epidural. But if and when we do have another child, I do want to try for a natural birth. I have always thought it would be a great idea to have a home water birth.
Thank you for posting this. I had planned on a fully natural childbirth, and when I was diagnosed at 34 weeks with preeclampsia, I was devastated. Everything that I had planned on went out the window. I was induced at what they thought was 37 weeks (which they figured out later was only 36) and had to have an epidural to keep my blood pressure down. I felt like a failure because I had an epidural and all I could think about was everything I read about how “evil” epidurals are. In some cases, they are medically necessary, and result in a better outcome for mom and baby.
THANK YOU for this. I had an epidural and have no regrets or shame about it. Once I got it, my body was able to relax and dilated from 5 cm to 10 cm in about 2 hours. I then gave birth to my 9 lb, 5 oz sunnyside-up baby after 3.5 hours of pushing. My OB was wonderful and encouraging and I’m so proud of what I did that day.
I had my first one drug free and under 4 hours. It was a piece of cake.
People always say that the second labor is faster and quicker.
Well, faster, not so much. Quicker~ there was no warning when the second part of labor started. I completely skipped the first part and went to intense, painful, painful, painful contractions. I tried so hard to keep it drug free~ the bathtub didn’t help, my husband’s gentle and encouraging words didn’t help~ nothing did. About halfway through, I asked myself what I was trying to prove~ and went ahead and got the epidural. Ahhhh, the best man-made thing ever! I was completely at ease, and pushed the baby out with ease not too long after. The whole birthing process was 6 hours. My baby came out as alert as can be~ sucked with no problems! So, I’ve had it both ways and am happy with both birthings!
From the moment my husband and I began planning to have a baby, I knew I wanted to give birth naturally. I work in pharmaceuticals so I was loudly and openly mocked for this by my coworkers but I knew it was what was best for my baby.
On October 15th, my contractions started. Every five minutes. You could set a clock by them. But no baby came. On October 17th, I went to work. Still having contractions every five minutes but they never got any closer together and my water had not broken. On October 18th, I worked from home because I got stuck trying to get behind the steering wheel of my car and a neighbor had to free me. My contractions were still five minutes apart and I worked on my laptop while using my birth ball. Finally on October 19th, my water broke at 3am. I was so excited and my contractions increased almost immediately to two and a half minutes apart. After 16 hours of those contractions and a complete inability to rest due to back labor, I started thinking about an epi. When the midwife pulled my husband aside to talk about options to keep me out of the OR, I realized that if I asked for the epidural it might give me a better chance of having a say in what happened to me. I then tried to get up and walk for a while to see if that could help and I could barely take three steps without collapsing. I started to feel bitter and resentful towards my son, my husband and God and that was when I realized that I needed the epidural.
They had to re-do the line at one point because it slipped out but it gave me the chance to be emotionally present at my son’s birth. I was able to be joyful about our labor together. It gave my husband and my best friend (who was there for support) the ability to take turns napping until 9:30 on October 20th when I finally started pushing. After an hour of pushing (which felt so flipping fantastic that I don’t even have words for it), my son was born.
I don’t regret my decision to have an epidural. I think I got it for good reasons. I didn’t feel like I was afraid of pain or because it was pushed on me. I got it because I had clear goals in mind. My bestie made me work through my reasons with her before I said anything to the nurse and that really helped me to be happy with my decision.
When we have baby number two, I still want a natural birth but I don’t think I’ll be as fearful of the epidural. I know I can make it through 16 hours of intense labor with absolutely no interventions. 32 hours was just a little much.
My epidural was needed – I would have liked more support however at the time the circumstances were this. I had been going harcore active labour for 23 hours – uncoached, first babe tensing and just getting through every contraction, I stayed at home till about 20 hours. I when to hospital again midwives sat back and thought that I was coping really well so didnt intervene. By the time the contractions had started coming on top of each other (almost at transition) I was exausted – I had’nt rested or eaten anything I was tired out of resources but most of all completely out of all mental strength. I had the epi rested, felt my baby move down till I could feel herright there while I rested – without that rest im not sure if I would have been able to push her out – the down side – I could not feel her crown I tore very badly but I got her out.
I went into my pregnancy thinking that I was going to at least try to not do the epidural. Unfortunately, I was in a car accident at 39 and half weeks and it was decided my mutual decision between my OB and myself that I be induced. They started a cervical dilation medication and my contractions were getting stronger. The cervadil tampon fell out after only a few hours and since my contractions were steady and regular we opted not to have another put in. Fast forward to the next morning and my contractions had stopped and I was started on pit. I did very well without any pain medication until that evening. I was in alot of pain and despite me trying everything I could to relax I was unable to. I finally decided that it was time for me to get my epidural as I had been stalled at 4cm dilation for 3+ hours. Once my epidural was in and going I was able to relax and finish dilating to 10. During my pregnancy I read a ton of articles on the pros and cons of epidurals and knew that ultimately I would do what I felt was best for me and my baby boy.
You missed a really important one. What if that’s what mom really wants and is most comfortable with? I, for one, don’t have a super high pain tolerance. And I have very painful contractions. And I have had no problems with laboring while using an epidural. When I was pushing, I needed MORE epidural. Epidurals work for me, and I don’t need to use an excuse validated by ANYONE else to use one, okay?
And as far as “It would be best to help ensure mom gets adequate rest when she can during labor to prevent exhaustion from occurring” – for some women that means having an epidural. Period. Can you PLEASE add to your list, “It’s what you want!” Because knowing yourself when it comes to your birth is MOST important!
Another reason to add to the “sometimes epidurals can be a kindness” list are for mothers who are victims of sexual abuse. Sometimes the birthing process can be a trigger for these mamas and an epidural can numb those sensations that might remind them of their trauma which would otherwise have possibly created a very negative experience and attachment to their child.

GOZU was one of the first bands I heard from that label and “Locust Season” the band’s debut was nothing less than an excellent album, no doubt one of the best records of that year and why not, one of the most powerful “new entries” of past few years.
3 years have passed since then and GOZU return with their second album “The Fury of a Patient Man”. This one was written with the near impossible to accomplish task of keeping up with the instantly classic “Locust Season”.
Once more GOZU prove that their music is probably the perfect soundtrack for a lazy day full of bear and weed under a burning sun. “The Fury of a Patient Man” reminds of some of the best moments of QUEENS OF THE STONE AGE both lyrically and stylistically. Actually, this similarity can be both one of the weakest and strongest points of the album. Like I said, songwriting wise the compositions move to highest quality standards of QUEENS OF THE STONE AGE but on the other hand… the similarities are damn strong.
Comparing to the “Locust Season”, “The Fury of a Patient Man” is a bit more “one sided” in matters of influences and has a slightly feels less personal. However, what is truly rewarding with that record is that GOZU once more have written some damn powerful and addictive riffs. “Traci Lords” and the bluesy “Disco Related Injury” for example deliver some damn fine straight to core Raaawk music. Don’t expect to go crazy as you might have with “Locust Season” but YOU SHOULD expect to find nothing less than great Rock music yet once again from this great band.Client: New York-Presbyterian Hospital (Organ Donation) Faculty: Anthony Kovner, John Donnellan Team: Diane Donchak, Rebecca Leventhal, Rommel Milanez, Oscel Rivera, Maria Yamani Year: 2012.Quick update

- Just want to let folks know I made a bit of progress on the data
format.
First, the stuff in Files is somewhat out of date due to a couple of
errors I made: one, the hexdumps I made were swapping every other
byte, and the other is that the first two pattern rows I was
decoding are special cases (the first two rows are duplicated in the
data format... presumably with 'selector' applied).
The actual completed pattern "ends" at 06df and works backward.
At 6df back you first see the memos. Each memo is encoded as a
nibble (4 bits, or one hex digit). The low byte at 6df is the memo
for the first row, and the high byte at 6df is the memo for the
second row, and so forth. There is a nibble set aside for each row.
If there is no memo, then the nibble is 0.
Continuing to work backwards from the last memo is the first row of
the full pattern. Note that rows are aligned on nibble boundaries.
So if there is only one stitch in a row it still takes up a whole
nibble. If there are 5 stitches in the row (i.e., 5 bits), then I
believe it will take up two nibbles, (a nibble is 4 bits), and so
forth.
The header (the first 16 bytes of the first of the 1K sectors
written during a Save Pattern operation) has the number of stitches
and rows encoded in it.
Anyway, I'll write up something more complete soon as I determine
more things concretely, but I'm making progress.

There are endless reasons as to why pet reptiles have become prevalent with more families and within more homes. From their fascinating behaviors to their exotic physiques and stunning nature, reptiles are quite popular pets. In addition, many herpetoculturists and reptile enthusiasts appreciate the fact that various species of reptiles have remarkably long life spans. This is why there are reptile supplements and supplies available that have been specifically designed for promoting herp health and for providing pet reptiles with proper reptile care. As with many other types of pets, reptiles are prone to developing diseases and deficiencies when not given the proper care and nourishment, such as Metabolic Bone Disease (MDB), Osteoporosis, as well as the deficiency of Vitamin A. Promote the overall health and well-being of your precious herps today, while also helping to prolong their life spans by providing them with various health supplements developed specifically for reptile care.SHOOTER CHARLEY WALTERS

Oakdale's Dick Grzywinski, 65, a legendary fishing guide who used to take Billy Martin when he managed the Twins and Martin's pal Howard Wong on expeditions, recently was inducted into the Minnesota Fishing Hall of Fame.
"Billy was a big celebrity, but he was a great, regular guy, too," Grzywinski said.
Former Gopher Jordan Leopold of the Colorado Avalanche said the wrist he broke last season is fully healed.
Edina's Walter Bush, who oversees USA Hockey and is a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto, said it should be a "no-brainer" that Phil Housley of South St. Paul will be elected to the Hall someday.
Bush, who was to be in Moscow this week for the world hockey championships, doubts the U.S. Olympic team ever will return to collegiate players as it fielded when the Herb Brooks-coached 1980 team upset the Russians en route to winning the gold medal.
Mark Parrish of the Wild and Zach Parise of the New Jersey Devils are expected to play in the Minnesota four-on-four hockey league that begins June 18 at Drake Ice Arena in St. Paul.

BookmarksThis NSF funded Nanoscale Interdisciplinary Research
Team brings together investigators with backgrounds in physics, chemistry,
mechanical engineering and materials science. Together they are working
to develop new multiscale modeling tools and apply them to problems in
adhesion, nanotribology and nanofluidics. Studies of adhesion are examining
how surface roughness, surface chemistry, and capillary forces affect
stiction. This is the major cause of failure in micromachines and becomes
more important as device size decreases. Research on nanotribology will
start from contact geometries determined in the adhesion studies. Quantitative
comparison between continuum mechanics and MD simulations will be performed
at different scales to determine how continuum mechanics breaks down and
at what scale. The effect of molecular structure of boundary lubricants,
surface roughness, and other factors on friction in nanocontacts will
be studied. Work on nanofluidics will focus on changes in flow as the
mean free path becomes comparable to some dimensions of the flow path,
with an emphasis on understanding lubricant transport to and around nanoscale
contacts.

and Astronomy Home PageDivorce and family law cases sometimes get ugly. And, in ugly cases, it is not uncommon for one or both of the parties to have a personality disorder or other mental health condition. Under certain circumstances, a party's mental health is legitimately relevant to a proper determination of child custody or alimony. Many times, however, there are improper motivations for seeking confidential mental health records and information. Your family law attorney should know when this evidence is subject to discovery.
A party to a divorce or family law proceeding normally has the right to prevent disclosure of communications or records made for the purpose of diagnosis or treatment of a mental or emotional condition, including alcoholism and other drug addiction. See Fla. Stat. § 90.503(2). This privilege applies to communications between a patient and a psychotherapist, or persons who are participating in the diagnosis or treatment under the direction of the psychotherapist. Id. The term "psychotherapist" is broadly defined, and includes doctors, psychologists, therapists, social workers, drug and alcohol abuse counselors, and nurse practitioners who are engaged primarily in the diagnosis or treatment of a mental or emotional condition. See Fla. Stat. § 90.503(1)(a).
This psychotherapist-patient privilege, however, is not absolute. In a child custody dispute, the mental and physical health of both parents is a factor that must be considered by the trial judge in determining the best interests of the children. See Leonard v. Leonard, 673 So. 2d 97, 99 (Fla. 1st DCA 1996). A party does not waive the psychotherapist-patient privilege merely by seeking child custody. See Leonard, 673 So. 2d at 99. But, in situations where a calamitous event such as an attempted suicide occurs during a pending custody dispute have courts have found that the mental health of the parent is sufficiently at issue to warrant an exception to the statutory privilege. See, e.g., Miraglia v. Miraglia, 462 So. 2d 507 (Fla. 4th DCA 1984); Critchlow v. Critchlow, 347 So. 2d 453 (Fla. 3d DCA 1977)..
Absent a "calamitous event," the law requires courts to preserve the privilege. See, e.g., Koch v. Koch, 961 So. 2d 1134, 1135 (Fla. 4th DCA 2007). Courts will not find a waiver of the privilege based on mere allegations of mental or emotional instability. See Leonard, 673 So. 2d at 99. Competent substantial evidence is required. "To hold otherwise would eviscerate the privilege; a party seeking privileged information would obtain it simply by alleging mental infirmity." Peisach v. Antuna, 539 So. 2d 544, 546 (Fla. 3d DCA 1989).
If evidence of mental health is still necessary in a custody case, the more appropriate method of securing the information is to require an independent psychological or psychiatric examination of the parent or parents. Schouw v. Schouw, 593 So. 2d 1200, 1201 (Fla. 2d DCA 1992). In this way, the trial court balances the need to determine the parents' mental health as it relates to the best interest of the child, and the need to maintain the confidentiality between a treating psychotherapist and the patient. Id.
Courts have also upheld the psychotherapist-patient privilege when a parent is trying to obtain information or records concerning a child's mental health. See Attorney ad Litem for D.K. v. Parents of D.K., 780 So. 2d 301, 307 (Fla. 4th DCA 2001); see also Kasdaglis v. Dep't of Health, 827 So. 2d 328 (Fla. 4th DCA 2002) (holding that social worker is under no obligation to furnish privileged therapy records of a sixteen year old to the child's mother without the child's consent). The statutory privilege applies to children, and parents do not have standing to waive the privilege. See Attorney ad Litem for D.K., 780 So. 2d at 307. If a child lacks the age or maturity to make a decision concerning the waiver or invocation of the privilege, the court should appoint an attorney ad litem for the child. Id. at 308.
In Attorney ad Litem for DK, the court explained its reasoning:
We recognize the tension apparent in the law between the rights and responsibilities of parents and the rights of children. Certainly, to promote strong families, parents should be involved and active in the lives of their children, including their health care, for which the parents are held responsible. Unfortunately, sometimes the parents are the cause of abuse, both emotional and physical, of their children. Allowing parents complete access to their children's health care records under all circumstances may inhibit the child from seeking or succeeding in treatment. The tension between the child's need for confidentiality and privacy to promote healing may conflict with the need of the court for information to inform its judgment as to the child's best interest.
See Attorney ad Litem for D.K., 780 So. 2d at 308. Courts have also held that even a court appointed guardian ad litem for the child may be excluded from accessing the child's confidential mental health records.
If you have questions about how mental health issues might affect your rights in a family law case, contact an experienced Florida family law attorney.75 Douglas Ct, Hoffman Estates, IL 60169

- Schaumburg.And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned. And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things.Yes, I am sure it was a day that they wanted to forget. But they didn't forget. They began to meet together and remember His death every first day of the week. The apostle Paul would even say, "For I determined not to know anything among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified" (1 Corinthians 2:2). As the facts began to come together for them, they began to think of Calvary as often as they could.(Luke 23:48, 49)
We, too, must make a pilgrimage to Calvary. If we are going to see what they saw, then we are going to have to look, even though the scenes are not pleasant. We must look upon the view at Calvary. Only there can we grasp certain essential truths. Only there can the most important facts of history be presented to us in a dramatic and unforgettable way.
At Calvary, we see Christ's righteousness despised! It was despised by the Jews and their leaders. They had been waiting for the Holy One of God; but when they beheld His holiness, they despised it. How sad that many Jews were unable to accept the very one they had been waiting and praying for.
Christ's righteousness was despised by the Romans. They were not involved in the religious debate over Jesus; yet they found cause to mock Him. Was there something in Jesus attitude that the callous Romans could not understand? These Romans admired power; and perhaps they could not appreciate this one who stood as a sheep stands dumb before the shearers.
Christ's righteousness was even despised by one of His own disciples. Judas, who was at one time a trusted confidant, saw Christ as one to be bartered. How ironic that the one most worthy of our highest praise was subjected to our lowest humiliation.
When Mahatma Ghandi, the great advocate of the nonviolent protest, was gunned down by an assassin, someone said, "Now we know how dangerous it is to be good." We see that point even clearer in Christ. The only place this world has for people like Jesus is on crosses.
We also see Christ's righteousness displayed. Here in the most trying time of His life we see His holiness shine through. Moments of trial tend to accent the best and worst in a person. In Christ, we see His goodness so clearly that we stand in awe. There is only goodness in Him.
His righteousness was displayed in His attitude toward His enemies. Would anyone have blamed Jesus for some few sarcastic words to those who conspired to put Him to death? Yet, Jesus showed only compassion for His enemies and asked the Father for their forgiveness. Earlier in His ministry, Jesus had talked about loving our enemies. We might have thought that His words were an unattainable ideal if He hadn't shown us how to love our enemies.
His righteousness was displayed in His attitude toward His friends. When we are in a time of great need, we hope our friends will support us. At Calvary, we do not see Jesus friends supporting Him - we see Jesus supporting His friends.
Christ's righteousness was displayed in His attitude toward suffering. Jesus accepts suffering. He realizes that no one can escape it. Jesus did not come to the cross cheerfully. If He had, we would have wondered about His sanity. No one enjoys suffering, not even the Lord. He did, however, accept suffering. He faced it in a way that inspires us all.
Christ's righteousness was displayed in His attitude toward death. Jesus wanted to avoid Calvary, but it wasn't because He was afraid to die. He might have been reluctant to face the pain of death. He might have wanted to live longer. He wasn't afraid to die. Listen to His final words: "Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit." What a beautiful way to look at death. When we die, we are placing ourselves in the hands of the Father.
We can look at Calvary and see the actions of Christ. Surely, we are led to say, "Thou art the Christ, the son of the living God."
We aren't the only ones to be affected by the scenes of Calvary. We have seen Christ's righteousness despised and Christ's righteousness displayed. Now, let us see Christ's righteousness declared.
Christ's righteousness was declared by Pilate. He said, "I find no fault in Him." Though he did not, as far as we know, believe in Jesus, Pilate knew a good person when he saw one. Though he did not have the courage to set Christ free, he could not bear to judge this Holy One.
Christ's righteousness was declared by the centurion. He said, "Truly this man was the Son of God." Admittedly, his faith was partial and incomplete; but he was strongly touched by the man on the cross.
Nature even declared Christ's righteousness. When Jesus died, all of God's fury was set loose upon Calvary. There was darkness and an earthquake. It was as if God's anger could be held back no more. The temple veil came apart. Surely a nagging thought crept into many minds: "What have we done?"
God didn t finish there. Three days later came the ultimate declaration of Christ's righteousness. The Father raised Him from the dead. This, the most dramatic and startling event in history, was done so that God could say once again, "This is my beloved Son." Only after the resurrection did the meaning of the cross become clear. This Jesus and His execution might have faded from memory without the resurrection. After He had risen, they could look back at the cross and comprehend it.
So, the disciples took this message with them. They declared to the world what they had seen. Down through the centuries the message of Jesus, who conquered sin and death, has been passed on.
So it comes to all - a compulsion to go to Calvary. People long to go to Jerusalem and see the place where Jesus died. It is, indeed, a moving experience. But it is far more important to come spiritually to Calvary. After our spiritual pilgrimage to Calvary, we will leave changed. At Calvary, our eyes grow moist and our throat becomes choked with emotion. Maybe then we can understand the spirit of that great hymn that.WATER-WAVE MODULATION
Abstract
Accurate numerical computations of wave trains with small modulations that grow are described. The range of wave steepness and modulation lengths that give breaking waves are determined. The number of wave crests is reduced for a time at greatest modulation but frequency downshifting is not observed. Near-breaking wave-group structure is always similar, with energy concentrated into one or two wavelengths.

These are what I have tried. Yet I like Chinese, Thai and Vietnamese food, as it is served in Australia and certainly for foreigners in Thailand and Vietnam.
But the fresh fruit and veg in Japan made me very angry, angry with Australia and Australians that we accept such appalling quality fruit and vegetables. The bananas in Japan were sublime. The lettuce crisp and tasty. A Jonathon apple like nothing you ever get in Australia. A pear, almost orgasmic. Oh, and the tomatoes. Not always great looking but soft, tasty and luscious. Cherry tomatoes, so sweet. We did try some more exotic f & v too. All good.
These are vastly superior to anything you may recall from your childhood, given from a neighbour, grown yourself, organic or bought at a farmer's market.
We are told in Australia that for various reasons, storage, shelf life, transport, that that is how our fruit and vegetables must be. Much is grown in Japan locally and sold in nearby towns, but fruit and veg are always seasonal. In the humid season that follows spring, and before the full on summer, how can tomatoes be in season? They must be greenhouse grown or shipped from way down south, thereby disproving the point that good f & v need to be robust to be transported.
Every piece of fruit or vegetable I tried was better than what we get in Australia. Shame on us for accepting crap (there, I swore, shows you how strongly I feel about it)
The Western food we ate in Japan was always good too, although I did not try a steak or lamb chops.
Once we had McDonalds, for breakfast. The Maccas in Japan offers very superior food to what we get here too. The burgers their did actually taste good, rather than being just a gut filler.
I really feel sorry for any Japanese person who comes to Australia and has to eat our crappy fruit and vegetables. Suppose our spuds are ok.
I know what you're saying about Japanese food. I eat anything and everything. But somehow, Japanese (in Australia at least) just doesn't do it for me. That said, if I visited Japan, I'd eat everything in sight except for dolphins and whales of course.
Oh, and on the fresh food issue. Yes, it's crazy that we expect "year round" produce in Australia. We should eat seasonal for many reasons, but we seem to have an expectation that we should have the same food all year round. I think it's a hangover from the old days of tinned fruit and vegetables, which were, perhaps, a hangover from the old days of being "Europeans in the Southern hemisphere". Lots of cultural cringe. It also amazes me that our rice growing distict, for example, is the Riverina, where it should possibly be in North Queensland. Ah well. The Australian climate is broad enough for us to eat a range of fruit and vegetables all year round. It's crazy that we import various oranges from the USA out of season, when our climate would allow them to be grown here also. Off my soapbox now...
The work credo and seasonal produce thing would never pass muster with the supermarkets who run the whole show here.
It's all relative. I missed the 'quality' of Australian fruit and vegetables when I was in Finland. Everything was expensive and only lasted a few days because they had already travelled such a long way to get there.
Btw...did you see rockmelons in Japan? I was shocked to see them being sold for the equivalent of AU $250. They looked perfect though and were beautifully presented in wooden boxes.
Although I have fairly broad tastes for food I too have never really warmed to Japanese food but if I were to visit there I would certainly give it a go.
The only 'Japanese' meals I enjoyed in the past were back in 1977-80 when I lived in Hong Kong. We used to vist Macau regularly for weekend breaks and would often stay at the Hotel Lisboa where the Japanese restaurant served steaks cooked at your table by a Japanese chef that simply melted in your mouth they were so tender. Not sure that you could regard the meals as 'Japanese' but I always assumed they represented what the Japanese would get at an upmarket steakhouse in their own country.
Back in the early 80s, one of my friends married a Japanese woman. Her family arrived for the wedding with their suitcases full of food. They were only staying a week.

James, we didn't mention the war or whales. Your second comment is very interesting. Of course there is no reason for us to import any fruit and vegetables. The only issue I have with what you said is that Australia is not suitable for growing growing rice at all. We should import that at least.
Correct Jayne. The power of Woolworths and Coles against growers needs to be pulled back big time.
AR, I would guess pickling is big in Finland. I am trying to recall, we saw big round fruit, individually packed with bump netting over it. I can't recall what it was and I did not check the price. I expect fruit like this is as much for a gift as anything thing.
Victor, maybe it is a people of a certain age who don't eat or like Japanese food. It amuses me to see tradies with their sushi boxes. I am sure Japanese and their chefs in Macau (arrogant US spellchecker is not accepting Macau)cater for their market well, but you just ain't gonna get a 400gm steak,which seems to be the fashion in some places here, not that I could eat that much.
Salient comment Pants. Never shall the east and west meet. But given how wide spread spread western eating places are in Japan, and the number of Japanese we saw eating in them, the Japanese seem a bit adventurous now about food.Terminate Brown contract
and cut the city's losses
After reading Friday morning's article in the Daily Journal concerning Cindy Brown and the Ethics Now report, I felt compelled to write and express my opinion on the continuation of Brown's contract by the City of Tupelo.
1. A consultant's reputation is built on the quality of service and/or product he/she provides to the client. I understand Brown's desire to protect the work product of her former clients, but her decision not to reveal the names of the companies or organizations she has served is ludicrous. Building a clientele of satisfied customers who will provide positive references is the lifeblood for bringing in new business to a consulting firm. Knowledge and access to those references allow the client to make an informed judgment. I believe the City Council was remiss in hiring Brown without proper references and in not holding the original consultant, Neil Trautman, accountable for passing off the city's contract to a subcontractor without appropriate assurances of Brown's reputation for quality service.
2. It strikes me as very disingenuous that Brown alleges that many city employees are in fear of losing their jobs if they speak to Brown. As a former attorney in the City Attorney's office, I worked with city employees, both management and rank and file employees, on a daily basis. I found them to be intelligent, hard-working and open-minded people who would not be easily intimidated. If city employees are not talking to Brown, it is because she has created an atmosphere of mistrust and suspicion.
3. The most recent comments made by Brown alleging that she is being “followed” and that her cell phone was “bugged” leads me to believe that a decision to continue a contractual relationship with Ethics Now is not in the best interest of the city and is an inexcusable expenditure of city funds. The idea of producing an objective and truthful report to determine if there is racial bias in the city's workplace is a good idea; however, in light of Brown's methods, the likelihood of receiving such a report is virtually nonexistent. Let's cut our losses now and move on.

Tupelo
Where is the competence
in Tupelo's bumbling?
I read with interest each day in the Daily Journal the apparent incompetence of Tupelo's city government. They can't keep a simple consulting contract from ballooning from $25,000 to $100,000 for a discrimination in hiring policy study. They cannot initiate a successful policy of traffic violation control (cameras)). Again, where is the “Good Neighbor” attitude, as I expressed in an earlier letter.
Back to money issues. In the earlier years of the proposed annexation study, while Larry Otis was mayor, a meeting was held at the Freewill Baptist Church on Veterans Boulevard. As one concerned citizen expressed at that meeting, “Tupelo only wants to increase their tax base by annexation.”
At that point, Mayor Otis expressed, “Oh no, Tupelo has plenty of money, we have over $25 million in the bank!” So with the current news in the Journal, we see that Tupelo has again “run short of money!”
Where has it gone? Is it being spent on new baseball fields behind Ballard Park, and for complete reconstruction of Thomas street?
Another recent shortsightedness has been brought out, the acquisition of land for the extension of Coley Road to the Gloster Street intersection with Barnes Crossing Road. The city fathers sat back in the early 1990s and watched the mall being built, but it took over five years for them to ever decide it would be good to four/five lane North Gloster from North Green street to the mall.
Now after all this time, they have tried to get a landowner to give a valuable piece of property to make a connection at Barnes Crossing. Is their head in the sand? Does Tupelo have city officials with any foresight for long range planning?
Look folks, this development on the north side of Tupelo has been going on now for more than 15 years. When are Tupelo's city fathers going to wake up and use some judgment in all the business they seem to be incapable of handling?
I still do not want to be annexed into the city of Tupelo.

Mitchell's article inaccurate
on Prentiss Co. schools
I am writing in response to Lena Mitchell's article on consolidating the Prentiss County schools, which appeared in the Aug. 15 Daily Journal. I am an employee of the Prentiss County School District. As a parent and an educator, I can see both the positive and negative sides of the consolidation issue. Mitchell adequately presented both the potential benefits and the potential problems involved in consolidating the two school districts in Prentiss County.
I question Mitchell's accuracy in reporting of reasons parents involved in a suit against the District felt their children would be “shortchanged by switching from Booneville to Prentiss County schools.” Mitchell listed “problems” with the county schools without presenting the other side of the story.
Had Mitchell researched the validity of the suit's claims, she would have found that the Prentiss County School District does, in fact, offer K-12 art, Advanced Placement English, Advanced Algebra, physics, Biology II, Chemistry I, Chemistry II, drama, after school tutoring, and Healthy Marriages Curriculum. Students in Prentiss County also have access to computer labs on all campuses.
The Prentiss County School District also offers football at Jumpertown and Wheeler (junior varsity) and Thrasher (varsity), baseball, boys' and girls' track, boys' and girls' tennis, and boys' and girls' powerlifting in grades 7-12, as well as junior high and high school cheerleading.
Contrary to the group's statement, students in Prentiss County do have access to Level 5 schools: New Site, Hills Chapel, Marietta, and Wheeler in 2006-2007. Jumpertown was a Level 4 school and Thrasher a Level 3 school.
Finally, had one bothered to look at the Subject Area Test scores listed in the Daily Journal, he or she could have seen that the Prentiss County School District's scores were among the highest in the area.
Mitchell's failure to research the claims made by the suing parents was irresponsible.
In a county where tensions already run high, feelings have been hurt, and extended family relationships have been strained, the last thing we need is for a journalist's unnecessarily inflammatory article to be printed in our regional newspaper.

Brown's claims won't hold
water without evidence
“I have been followed, and there is proof that my cell phone was tapped,” Cindy Brown said.
What a crock! Brown makes these allegations yet offers no evidence to substantiate such claims.
Brown also claims, “City employees are afraid, nine out of ten employees fear losing their jobs or some other type of retaliation if they're seen with me, which explains the mileage I've racked up driving to out-of-town locations to meet with interview subjects.”
Again she offers no proof, neither will Brown provide documentation of previous ethics studies, say's “that's confidential.”
How convenient! It is my opinion Cindy Brown has much experience in milking a situation for every cent she can squeeze. Our City Council says, “We are not going to give Cindy Brown a blank check.”
Surprise!, Council members, that's precisely what you've done.

Vegan' urges meat-free
diets against cruelty
I agree with Marty Russel's article (Aug. 22 column): “When it comes to animal abuse, we humans are species-ists'.”
Many believe dog fighting is an evil, barbaric blood sport, but we glance over our own contributions to animal suffering. While most of us couldn't stand to watch a dog fight, we don't mind eating the flesh of an animal that was killed in a slaughter house. We're so used to seeing a dog as a pet, while we view a cow as “food.” But both species can be just as loving and gentle. All animals deserve respect, but, unfortunately, many are treated cruelly.
I'm vegan, which means I don't eat meat, eggs, dairy -anything that comes from an animal. I also avoid animal products like leather, silk and wool. And I boycott animal acts such as circuses. I don't believe in harming animals for anything, especially when we already have so many alternatives.
I encourage anyone who is interested in making the world a better place for animals to consider a meat-free diet.

With the help of this list I managed to make a lowpass filter at 0.5
Hz and I also got various tips for improving the case. I got it up
and running in an improved state yesterday and all was set for a quake
to test it.
I noticed some pretty strong distortions beginning 11:52 UTC today and
picking up a lot about 12:24. I checked and there was a
6.7 quake off India at 11:40, which I presume is a candidate. My
location is Oslo, Norway.
Since I'm totally new to seismology, would anyone on this list comment
on the plot that my seismometer produced, does it look like a quake
and does my seismometer seem to work properly?
Here's a plot of the incident:

Plus size women have more to consider in the fashion stakes, but realistically it’s just about wearing flattering shapes and balancing out your figure. Instead of trying to squeeze into the latest trends (after all when did wet look leggings look good on anyone anyway?) it’s sometimes best to find the trends that work for you and invest in them instead.
Prints and patterns can be a godsend for larger ladies; they can help disguise problem areas in a flattering way. Try on a few prints to see what works for you and don’t be afraid to try something new!
The key to dressing for your shape is to learn how to balance your body. If you’re top heavy, wearing darker colours on your top half can help minimize your bust, while brighter colour or pattern on your bottom half can help balance out your figure. The opposite applies for those with larger hips or a bigger bottom. Clever designs like an empire line or ruching can also help o disguise problem areas like a larger belly or wide hips. If you have broad shoulders you can balance these out with a full skirt or a one shouldered top or dress.
You can disguise lumps and bumps with the help of control underwear – it’s not for everyday of course but for special occasions it’s certainly worth the investment to help create a smooth silhouette underneath your clothes.
There are a range of retailers such as K & Co who now have specific ranges catering for plus sized women, so at least you don’t have to worry about choice!

TLC has temporarily halted production on of Jon and Kate Plus 8 after Gosselin fired off two cease-and-desist letters and posted a sign at his home warning camera crews to stay away.
The 10th-most liked member is attempting to not only take his ball and go home—and make off with the entire playground—after the cable net announced the octodad has been dropped from the soon-to-be rebranded reality hit. Gosselin's latest gripes also come just hours before he launches his media blitz on, we suspect, a largely uninterested nation.
Ironically enough, while Gosselin was quick to defend the production's noninvasive presence in his children's lives for the many years he was involved in the show, now that he's been ousted, he seems to have suddenly developed a few moral problems with their participation. Go figure.
"Effective immediately, no production crews are to enter Jon's family home for any reason," one of the letters, sent to TLC by attorney Mark Jay Heller, read. "In the event that anyone enters the marital property, Jon Gosselin will notify the local authorities to effectuate police action against any trespassers."
The family's Wernersville, Pa., home has long served as the backdrop of the reality show and, you'll recall, many a makeshift paparazzi photoshoot and press conference for Jon himself. (Judging by the newly erected and clearly unspell-checked notice signed by "Johnathon Gosselin," we're guessing such newsworthy events are numbered.)
And while the letters were dated Tuesday, the same day of TLC's Jon-dumping announcement, he claims the decision to pull the kids was made several weeks ago.
"This isn't about money," Heller told E! News. "This isn't a negotiation tactic. This is about his kids. He's worried about what impact the show is having on them and is taking action.
"He's done with the show."
And apparently wants his kids to be, too. But not because he's jealous, mind you. Au contraire.
"He hasn't been fired. As TLC said in their statement, they have an 'exclusive' contract with him. He has been trying to get out of that contract for a long time.
"TLC has issues with the Pennsylvania department of labor, they've got issues with Jon saying he thinks the kids are starting not to like the cameras. He's taking action to protect his children."
As for those issues, Heller claims the cable net not only never followed through on obtaining the special permits required by Pennsylvania Child Labor Law to legally film the eight-strong brood, but they failed to properly pay the kids.
A spokesperson for the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry confirmed to E! News that there remains an active investigation into the show, after allegations surfaced earlier this year that child labor laws may have been breached. They noted, however, that "no new information" was available to release about the investigation.
Heller went on to say that TLC may not have a leg to stand on if they wish to fight Gosselin's legal action, saying their contract with the family may prove unenforceable and that the network has yet to pay the children for their four years on the series.
TLC, as you would expect, has come out swinging against Gosselin's claims.
"We are aware of Jon Gosselin's recent statements and remain deeply disappointed at his continued erratic behavior," a spokesman for the broadcaster told E! News.
."
Which seems to be exactly what Jon wanted in advance of next month's planned Kate-centric relaunch of the show.
"I am totally confident that he will be completely successful in his quest to take back control of his family and preserve, protect and ensure their future well-being by putting the brakes on his divorce and pulling the plug on TLCm the media giant that he perceives as a monster that has exploited and manipulated his family and has been partially responsible for the breakdown of his marriage."
And here we thought the Gosselins were overdramatic.
As for the reality dad, he has not and will not, per his lawyer, give the required consent for his kids' involvement and, if necessary, seek court intervention.
"Jon is resolved not to allow the TLC corporate machine to devour his family and promote the monster's best interests over those of his family."
Citing the network's recent quarterly earnings of some $186 million, which he claims came "compliments of the Gosselin Family," Heller claims that it's the cable channel that's motivated by dollar signs, not his client.
"Jon firmly believes that their greed to continue that cash flow will be trumped by his courage and determination to protect his family."
His parental concern would seem much more genuine if only it had come before his pay cut.

When I was a graduate student, a friend working on modernist literature reported a harrowing experience from his oral qualifying examinations. Though my friend is exhaustively well read, and quick on his feet, his committee had managed to open the exam with a question that stumped him: “What is modernism?”
My friend recovered from this early pitfall and passed his exam, but the unsettling disorientation of the question stayed with both of us. By the measure of scholarly attention, the study of modernism is at a high-water mark, yet (or: so) its definition and scope are harder than ever to pin down. Is modernism defined by its formal elements, by its aesthetic philosophy, by its subject matter, or simply by its era?
Paul Stasi’s Modernism, Imperialism, and the Historical Sense opens with an account of this muddle and attempts to resolve it with, surprisingly, imperialism, a subject that on its surface seems to have borne little interest for modernist writers. Yet if the modernists make little overt response to imperialism, modernist method, with its hodgepodge of linguistic modes and cultural references, depends on the historical and cultural accumulation that, Stasi writes, “only occurs in the centers of capitalist production.” The modernist writers he discusses—Eliot, Pound, Joyce, and Woolf—came from disparate places, both geographically and socially, and their writing was similarly diverse; what united them, according to Stasi, was the task of writing literature in English in the centers of European capital during what E. J. Hobsbawm calls “the Age of Empire.” Neither overtly resisting imperialism nor, as is often alleged, indifferent towards it, these authors’ innovation was to use the ambivalent fruits of imperialism—the newly ubiquitous world of consumer goods, the suddenly accessible wealth of foreign and traditional art—as the material and subject matter for their writing.
To some extent, Stasi’s book is a return to Hugh Kenner’s classic The Pound Era: like Kenner, Stasi sees modernism as self-consciously incorporating the work and culture of the past into a literature for the present. (Eliot’s “Tradition and the Individual Talent” is frequently quoted.) What Stasi brings to this classic synthesis of old and new is an additional synthesis based on culture rather than chronology: modern-ist works attempted to incorporate the art and history of other cultures without treating them as “other,” just as they incorporated the art of past eras without treating it as mere nostalgia. While the flâneurs of mid-nineteenth-century Europe viewed themselves as standing outside or above their society, the writers of the Age of Empire were aware that their world had grown too big to totalize: “The national space within which Flaubert was still able to locate his contextual meanings was no longer, in the modernist period, the most important horizon for thinking about the relations among competing social forces.” This seems accurate as regards the modernists, but the distinction seems historically arbitrary: since the Age of Empire, by Hobsbawm’s definition, began circa 1875, why did the “modernist period” not begin until the twentieth century? Stasi has little to say about Wilde, Hardy, or Henry James, or other figures who were also presumably affected by the imperialism that was by the 1890s well under way.
The theoretical basis for Stasi’s argument is both broad and deep, and one of his strengths is an ability to handle dense theoretical material with clarity and interest. The most important figures in chapter one, where this theoretical basis is outlined, are from Marxism and postcolonial theory, as Stasi attempts to resolve the standard binary between these schools by arguing that modernism joins Marxism in rejecting the idea of constant historical progress, and joins postcolonial theory in rejecting the reification of the Self and the Other. All of this synthesis—past and present, foreign and domestic, Marxist and post-colonial—has a distinctive effect on the book’s language, as evidenced by Stasi’s wide range of recurring dialectical terms: both, simultaneously, an untenable opposition, two competing ideologies, two different theories, two paradoxical effects. Some may find this pattern repetitive; to me it is a refreshing alternative to the “take-sides approach” to literary theory that seems...

"I will be putting that savings into her college fund," said father-to-be Scott Greenberg, who recently took out a five-year car loan at 2.64 percent, a move that extended his total payments, but allowed him to save $100 per month, on his previous car payment, the Times said.
Consumers are more comfortable with longer car loans in part because cars are lasting longer and come with better warranty packages, the Times said.
Still, car loans in the past were considered long at four years -- and then five.
Auto industry research firm J.D. Power and Associates said 30 percent of the car loans written so far in 2013 have been for six years or longer
Five years ago, only 23 percent of car loans were contracts of six years or longer.
Low interest rates could also fool consumers into buying cars beyond their means. "Someone who really has the budget for a Corolla figures if they extend the financing out, they can buy a Camry," said James Lentz, chief executive of Toyota Motor Corp.'s North American division.
Still some deals are hard to refuse. Plymouth, Mich., resident Bradley Gallant said he borrowed at 1.82 percent for 72 months, which made monthly payments $130 per month cheaper compared to a four-year loan. In the end, he will pay $370 more in total interest, but that is so small, the finance executive figures he can put the $130 per month into an investment that will earn far more than $370.
"I am confident I could invest the cash in alternative investments and earn a much higher return," Gallant said.
Car companies should not mind the trend, either, because the longer the loan the more money they make with very little additional risk.
Personal finance advisers are not huge fans of going into debt and some disapprove of the new trend.
"You really have to do the math. Personally, I don't like paying extra money for the privilege of being in debt," said Casey Bond, managing editor of GoBankingRates.com, a personal finance information company.SPRINGFIELD –Summer thunderstorms aren’t what they used to be. Today, these wonders of nature appear to be more threatening than ever before, with dangerous cloud to ground lightning, high winds, hail and torrential rain.. Joseph Schmidt, vice chair, Emergency Medicine, Baystate Medical Center.
Those who don’t die:
• Seek shelter when a thunderstorm is approaching (you are much safer indoors or inside an enclosed car).
• Avoid tall, isolated structures, such as tall, single trees or flag poles; don’t hold a “lightning rod” such as a golf club, umbrella, or tent pole.
• Stay away from open fields, open structures or vehicles, or contact with conductive material, such as computers, telephones, water pipes, or fences.
• Avoid being near, on, or in water.
• Turn off, unplug, and stay away from electrical appliances, televisions, computers and power tools. Stay away from windows, fireplaces and water pipes and drains.
• Do not use the telephone.

Coming off last week’s 12-team mock draft, Michael, Derek and I wanted to reflect on some lessons learned in an expert league in which a total of 324 players were scooped up. By the time the 27-round melee was winding down, not even the likes of Jason Vargas and Josh Donaldson were beyond the reach of hungry fantasy owners needing to plug holes.
Along the way, we noticed some trends in player depth, strategy and our own oversights that could surely apply to other drafts over the next few weeks.
Michael Stein
Roto and head-to-head points leagues have their pros and cons, but it is indisputable that the evaluation of certain players and overall drafting styles differ. In H2H points leagues, starting pitchers are more valuable commodities because of additional points awarded for complete games, quality starts, strikeout bonuses, etc. In roto leagues, the distinction between the top starters and the second or third tier is less pronounced. That’s why I had planned on waiting at least five or six rounds before taking a pitcher.
Instead, I caved to my own pressure and took Felix Hernandez and Cliff Lee with my wrap-around third and fourth picks. Playing Monday morning quarterback, I realize I could have waited another round or two and still taken very solid pitchers while filling critical offensive positions with hitters such as Matt Holliday, Dustin Pedroia,or Jacoby Ellsbury.
Karl de Vries
I made a similar mistake in my shortsighted decision to grab starting pitching before the best hitting had dried up. Typically, it seems, pitching is much easier to harvest during the season, especially when it comes to closers. But I was still a bit taken aback by the shallowness of the outfield pool this year. I wasn’t nearly aggressive enough in picking up sticks in the draft’s early rounds, and as someone who held back a bit in fleshing out his five-man outfield, I was flat-footed when the bodies started dropping early—17 picks in the first four rounds alone. As the draft dragged on, I felt lucky to grab Carlos Quentin (18.3), Chris Young (20.3) and Alfonso Soriano (21.10), a trio that alone could doom my squad to a season of mediocrity.
Derek Ambrosino
This was my second mock draft of the offseason, and what concerned me was how many of the players I wound up with on both teams. I don’t mind having “my guys,” and I’m not against roster repetition across multiple teams, but I figured this draft, pound for pound, included even more savvy owners compared to my previous draft. One way I’d confirm my hypothesis—that I got some value picks in the previous draft—would be if I was unable to get those same players again.
I’m not talking about the fact that I nabbed the same catcher pair in both drafts, as that was a strategic decision. I’m talking more about picks like Paul Konerko (8.11), Johan Santana (17.2) and Josh Beckett (22.11)—guys who I thought may have been value picks, but who now deserve a closer look to see if the rest of the fantasy community knows something about them that I’ve overlooked.
Michael Stein
Another lesson learned is that patience can pay off when it comes to third base. It’s no secret that third base has become one of the shallowest fantasy baseball positions, but I passed on it until I selected Martin Prado in the eighth round. I could have waited even longer and still ended up with respectable choices such as Kyle Seager (14.7), David Freese (15.11), Manny Machado (17.8) or Kevin Youkilis (20.11) in the mid to late teen rounds. While third base doesn’t have as many premier choices as it once did, there is plenty of decent quality down the list which can be obtained for great value if you have patience.
Karl de Vries
On the individual level, I’ve noticed that people like Carlos Gomez (22.2). A lot. That was made clear in the draft room chatter, and reinforced for good measure Wednesday by Derek and Brad. And why not? We’ve known for years that Gomez can run like the wind, but 19 home runs last year? With a likely full-time job lined up in Milwaukee, Gomez is not just a rotisserie demon; he’s the kind of guy who could make a splash in my preferred H2H style of play, provided he can learn to take a walk and bring the strikeout rate below 20 percent. Regardless, he’s someone who will likely be under the radar in my league, which should translate to a nice steal—har, har—in the late rounds.
Derek Ambrosino
Honestly, I don’t do a whole lot of in-depth preparation on individual players prior to the season, but perhaps I should drill down a bit more. One thing keeping me from overreacting, however, is the awareness that I am generally more along the conservative side when building teams. I also usually approach mock drafts straight up and experiment too profoundly, or with multiple different deviations in the same draft. I opt more for the solid contender than the monster upside team. This may not be the most fun or popular mind state with which to approach a mock draft.
Karl de Vries
Some useful thoughts going forward, guys. Nicely done. Now that we’ve looked at some of the draft’s best value picks, most head-scratching reaches and lessons learned, it might be time to take a look at which owner walked away with the best squad. We’ll pick this up early next week.

Power is king in my league. I don’t care about balance in the draft if good power falls. The odds of being able to ‘trade it up’ is very good.
If Ike Davis does what he’s expected to, that’s an easy swap for Bourn or Jennings later on (both went > 50 picks before him).
To add my two cents since I responded to the wrong prompt:
I learned that OF depth is much shallower than years past, although that also means that there are more exploitable platoons. I’m not sure if that means I’m more or less inclined to invest in OFers yet.
Starting pitcher is extremely deep. Around round 22, I realized that I would have been comfortable fielding a rotation purely from players still available. SP always seems deep, but I usually find that it’s shallower than it appears at first glance. Not this time around.
The other surprise was that there are substantially more workable catchers available than in years past. I usually pay a premium in 2 C leagues to leverage the scarcity (usually at the expense of OF), but I won’t be this year. 1 C leagues need not put any premium on catcher.
I want to make a follow-on point stemming from Brad’s remark on pitching depth.
This seems obvious or intuitive, but it is worth repeating. The depth in SP not closes the gap between pitchers taken highly and those who can be had later, but it also raises the value of elite offensive players. The candle burns at both ends, if you spend too highly on pitching you can burn quickly.
Run prevention and run prevention is a zero-sum game. Every run that pitcher doesn’t give up is an RBI, R, and may HR that isn’t earned by the collective offensive output of batters. So, if more and more pitchers are turning in 3.50 and lower ERAs, that means fewer fringe players are cobbling together those solid 23 HR and 85 RBI seasons, making elite level offense production that much more important.[0001] The present application is related to and claims the benefit of priority of the following commonly-owned provisional application(s): application Ser.

Further description of MDF is available in “RFC 1321: The MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm,” (April 1992), the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.

A security policy may be enforced by hardware and software systems that effectively implement access rules for access to systems and information. Further information on security policies is available in “RFC 2196: Site Security Handbook, (September 1997),” the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. In this document, “security policy” or “policy” refers to a set of security policies and rules employed by an individual or by a corporation, government entity, or any other organization operating a network or other computing resources.
[0025] SSL: SSL is an abbreviation for Secure Sockets Layer, a protocol developed by Netscape for transmitting private documents over the Internet. SSL works by using a public key to encrypt data that is transferred over the SSL connection. Both Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer support SSL, and many Web sites use the protocol to obtain confidential user information, such as credit card numbers. SSL creates a secure connection between a client and a server, over which data can be sent securely. For further information, see e.g., “The SSL Protocol, version 3.0,” (Nov. 18, 1996), from the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.
[0026] VPN: VPN stands for Virtual Private Network, a network that is constructed by using public wires to connect nodes. For example, there are a number of systems that enable creation of networks using the Internet as the medium for transporting data. These systems use encryption and other security mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can access the network and that the data.

The larva is in all flour so if you let your flour sit to long they hatch and then you have beatles. The only way I know of is to use your flour quickly or put it in the freezer.
Hope that helps.
That is one of the strangest things I have ever heard. Can you provide any kind of reference or back-up for this claim?? Frankly, I think this is a myth.
sue
You have been VERY lucky, if you have nerver had an infestation of these pests! I noticed them about three years ago in my house, and I have not gotten completely rid of them, yet. I now do not see any products infested with these insects, BUT I do see the moths flying around every now and then, so I know there is an infestation somewhere. I seal opened boxes of cereal, flour, rice, etc in Ziplock bags. The whole wheat, cornmeal and other whole grain cereal in the refrigerator, or the freezer.
This is no myth!
Ford
Faith,
If I put it in the freezer, do I need to seal it with plastic wrap?
Also, doesn't the grinding destroy the larva?
Jim
I would put in a plastic bag and try to reduce any moisture from the anti frost cycle affecting the flour.
Sue here are just a few.
There are many others search Sitophilus granarius
mealy bugs, old flour, flour bugs
All raw grains and cereals carry them. That is why buying flour (products from flour and grain mixtures) too far ahead of your needs can end with a healthy batch of added protein. A good sieve will also remove them. Problems arrise when they reach adulthood and many will fly and crawl around into other foodstuffs and soon everything is invested with them. That's what storage bins are all about and rotation of stock and expiration dates. Oh, and they can eat thru plastic bags and cardboard. Some sure signs that they are in your cupboard are dust inside noodle boxes, chewed corners of boxes, extra dust around such boxes and fine webs and tiny moths coming from "nowhere."
The moths (sitophilus granarius) that are found most commonly in flour in your pantry can come from the field, it can be picked up in the grain bins where it is stored before it is sold, or picked up in any step of the milling process or even in the store where you buy it. Common stuff, they are a part of nature, and even if you eat them, completely harmless.
Even if you see no evidence of infestation in the store, you can still get them. What is in the flour are the eggs of the moth, as the larva and adults can easily be sifted out of the flour. The eggs are so tiny that it is nearly impossible to get every last one.
However, there is an easy, easy way to prepare your flour for long-term storage, and that is to freeze it completely for at least 24-48 hours or longer if you can. The lower below 0 deg F the better, and the longer you can hold it there the better. The low temps cause ice crystals to form in the eggs, which burst and destroy them. Larger bags take longer to get completely cold to the core. I like to leave mine in the deep freeze for a week. You can leave your flour in the paper bag, or wrap in plastic to help minimize freezer odors. Once you remove it from the freezer, store in an airtight foodsafe container. Five gallon foodsafe buckets are great, as long as you use a mylar or plastic liner, as it can help to seal it tighter. Five gallons will hold just about 25 lbs of ground flour. White flour can keep for years, whole grain flours keep for three to six months depending on temp but can go rancid. You might want to just store the whole grain and grind as needed, as at the right temp & humidity it can keep for centuries.
There is no pesticide approved for food use on or around flour. So once you find them, freeze then sift to remove larva & adults. Sticky traps can reduce the occurance of the moths in your pantry. Store all your grains, convenience foods, and cereals in airtight thick plastic (cambros or equivalent) or metal containers.
Garbage bags are NOT food safe! Pesticides can coat the inside or be incorporated into the plastic, so it can and will leach into the food.
Good luck!
Flour weevils; I've never seen them, and I've had a 25KG sack of flour knocking around for a year! Yes you can get them, but it's hardly guaranteed.
I've heard of some commercial places using the flour regardless.... I personally wouldn't.
Bay leaves are a very effective repellent for grain moths. Wherever you have grain, cereals or anything related, sprinkle a few bay leaves around.
It works,
Jeff
Yes, bay leaves work very well. I've used them as well, but after a few months in storage, I find the flour has a bay leaf flavor. So I chose to freeze it, then seal it in a container until I'm ready to use it.
The reason I keep flour and grains so long is that I work/live on a wheat farm. It's cheaper to hang on to the wheat and grind the whole wheat myself instead of sending it through the "system" and then buying it for double or triple at the store! About the only flour I buy anymore is cake flour.
Aware that bay leaf flavor transfer is a possiblity, I sprinkle the bay leaves near and around but never in the flour.
Jeff
they will drive you crazy getting rid of them. I got them in my pantry and it took a long time to find the reason and rid myself of them. I freeze all flours and meals and if I have room, I just leave them in there. I keep AP flour in a sealed container in the cabinet but all others are in one of the freezers. I bought those sticky Pantry Pest traps which worked well for the moth and then I did a complete search of the kitchen. Turns out they were in a boxed product with a plastic bag inside, never been opened. And it was a mess. I don't remember what it was, but something to do with nuts. I remembered thinking that I didn't know they would like nuts, but they did. My nuts stay in the freezer too now, and we just keep a Mason jar full in the cabiner. I am paranoid about the little things. I do wrap my flours in plastic wrap before freezing.
I remember we had to pull the pantry apart and seal all the plywood shelving and supports by painting and sealing them before she would put anything into it. They were hiding in there sure enough. Not only in the wood but between the shelves and the walls in all the rough edges.
Thank you to everyone for your comments. I finally realized that the pests in our house last fall were these. The source was a vase full of pheasant tail feathers. Once we got rid of the feathers, they finally died out. Just to be on the safe side, I'm packing by flour into large zip-lock freezer bags and storing them in the freezer. Thanks again to everyone.
Jim
Bay leaves were also my grandmother's preventive, but I was concerned about the flavor going into baked goods. I stored my great-aunt's things in an outdoor public storage facility and discovered that I had included her flour which was in a very large metal pretzel can. That flour was in there in all kinds of weather for more than a year and I was amazed to see that it was completely bug free! I used that can for years and just recently got rid of it only because of its size.Register with us or sign in

Dude, I got news for you! You guys are Slavs. Even if we do consider that there is an independent Macedonian history, you are in no way its inheritors.
Since you talk about nations and pride and all this right wing crap, you should know that Slavs didn’t even exist at the time of Alexander.
Now, I do understand that being a heir of a glorious warrior’s history is probably the only thing that can hold you together as a nation, but having said that, I really struggle to understand the logic behind your arguments.

@Harry the Great
We are Slavs meaning the “Glorious ones”, there was not another tribe on this Earth that was as Glorious as the Macedonians, thus Slavs is synonymous with Macedonians.
Please read this post:
By the way, your posts are posted unaltered, you thought that I would moderate them? If so why?
20080418 at 16:38
Dude, do you know where the name SLAVS came from, and what is the meaning of it ?
20080420 at 03:07
I have a question, “Harry”: Who is we, DUDE? And who gives a f*** what you consider, since you have no connection to the Macedonians.
Btw, can you recite what is written at “″ (minus the quotation marks)
under the heading “Macedonians and Greeks: Language, Culture and Attitudes”? Just the first paragraph will do. And tell the readers in what year that was published. You’ll have to do a little bit of a research, but if you want to learn something, you must do a bit of work. :-)And… enjoy your short history lesson, DUDE. :-)
20080420 at 10:42
Why only the first paragraph and not the rest of the text that according the sources (Borza, Danforth e.t.c.) the Slavs, both Bulgarians and Macedonians* cannot establish a link with antiquity…!!
Tell me zhivko ?
Edited by makedonika: akritas, there is no people called slavmacedonians, if there would then there also should be slavbulgarians, slavrussians, slavpoles, slavserbs etc. The correct term is Macedonian/s, the Macedonians are a Slavic-speaking people. If you intend to keep posting on this Blog you will need to refer to the Macedonians as Macedonians. Simple is it not?
20080421 at 01:30
Akritas,
Firstly, about the “first paragraph”. The first paragraph is the “CONCLUSION” of the book. The rest of the book consists of the EVIDENCE (EXAMPLES from the ancient texts) which have led the authors Heckel and Yardley to make that conclusion.
Now, can you help Harry and recite what that paragraf says, Akritas? Or is it too painfull for both of you, since it COMPLETELY exposes the LIES of the present day “Greeks” about ancient Macedonia/Macedonians? :-)
Secondly, Borza is a scholar of ANCIENT history, NOT modern day history. You know this very well because this has been explained many times in alt.news.macedonia, soc.culture.greek, etc.
Now, explain to me why I (Macedonians) are “Slavs”. What is your “proof” for that? I can’t wait for your magical “revelation”, because magic is the only thing that can transform the Macedonians into “Slavs” :-)
One warning, though: someone saying that we are “slavs” is NOT a proof.
Ova za “makedonika” – ve molam prestanete so gluposta “slovenski jazik”. Makedoncite zboruvaat na makeonski, tochka.

Sorry, I forgot to tell “Akritas” that the book was published in 2004, although this book has been discussed in alt.news.macedonia, soc.culture.greek on more than one occasion. This must be different “Akritas”, god forbid. :-)
And one more thing you can even read the “conclusion” (page 7 – and other pages, as well) of that book on Internet.

Vo pakistan se uste postojat pleminja koi se ostanati uste od Aleksandar.Pojdete da vidite nivniot folklor so cij folklor e totalno identicen.So koja drzava imaat ista muzika i muzicki instrumenti,bez da se znaat megusebno ili da imaat bilo kakov kontakt.Samo togas ke vidite koja drzava e naslednik na Aleksandar i cela negova slava.Se e vo genite napisano!
Dodeka za toa sto Aleksandar gi pocituval grcite ,toa go mozat samo Makedoncite,Bidejci samo nie imame tolku siroki srca sto grcite tia i nemozat da go svatat.
Toa e Makedonskiot imperijalizam(Osvojuvame so ljubov)
Toa e pricinata sto makedinija postoi i vo svetoto pismo BIBLIJA (BIBLE) ,toa e pricinata sto makedinija ja cuva Gospod,Tokmu zatoa Makedonija ke postoi ZASEKOGAS.

The Cook County ordinance [text] in question prohibits the possession and sale of "assault weapons." The ordinance bans high-capacity, rapid-fire rifles and pistols and was amended in 2006 to include assault weapons with large magazines. The bill's supporters claim that such weapons should be banned because "there is no legitimate sporting purpose for the military style assault weapons now being used on our streets," and "assault weapons are twenty times more likely to be used in the commission of a crime than other kinds of weapons." Opponents of the ban claim they need these weapons for self-defense and sporting purposes. While the lower trial and appeals courts ruled that the ban was constitutional without proceeding through a full trial, the Supreme Court of Illinois ruled that the issue should be investigated further and the bill's challengers should be permitted to present evidence that guns with legitimate purposes are encompassed by the ban:.The case will be remanded to trial court in order to hear evidence from both sides as to whether the ban is constitutional.
The ruling is the latest in the continuing gun control controversy. In March, a federal judge in Maryland ruled a portion of a gun permit law unconstitutional [JURIST report]. Illinois citizens challenged [JURIST report] the Cook County ordinance in July 2010, just weeks after the US Supreme Court [official website] ruled that the Second Amendment applies to states and municipalities [JURIST report] in addition to the federal government, citing the holding in District of Columbia v. Heller [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST report]. In Heller the Supreme Court held that the Second Amendment protects the right to possess a handgun in the home for the purpose of self-defense.Run Java patches are the most urgent as one, CVE-2014-4227, scores ten out of ten in the common vulnerability rating system.

So far as can be ascertained I am the only person of that name in Vancouver and I did not write the letter in question, although I have been the recipient of a number of rather abusive letters in connection therewith.

she was never the beautiful, long-haired mother i wrote about in poems
she never walked barefoot through forests green blades of grass,
sheared a perfect two inches,
one blade at a time carpeting the front lawn of her pink and white bungalow.
she just wasn’t that lucky.
sunflowers and rose bushes never draped across white picket fences
her garden merely yielded curtailed dandelions polka dotted across patches of brown.
she learned to value their beauty because they had such pretty names, "dandelions."
however, she, my mother, still dreamt of sunny spring Saturdays
drenching her dreams with lemonade stands and sprinklers,
heart-shaped bushes and glass Coke bottles, liberty and justice for all.
but somehow, somehow she knew better than to dream too unsilently.
as a child she would fill my days with baloney sandwiches and flavored tap water.
then, i never understood how hard she tried to keep me happy,
and even up until today,
i have yet to discover how often she dreams.
but somehow, somehow i know its always about me and the husband she never had.
she was never that medallion-shaped, apron-cloaked mistress moving proud across the wooden floor she dreamt of
wearing almost perfectly white socks,
stretched disproportionate at the ankles from carrying life as pure as those damn white walls
she just wasn't that lucky,
but today wont let her forget.
wont let her sink into an oblivion of white walls and pined floors.
an oblivion of finely tuned but extremely rhythmless music.
mother, those dandelions are singing to you.
loud, boastful, brilliant.
mother, those dandelions are beautiful.
like you, but like you even they forget.
sorry they couldnt grow up amongst roses.
sorry they sprang from the cracks,
etched in povert America.
they grew up among society’s weeds.
the neighborhood hates those dandelions,
the neighborhood wants to kill those dandelions,
but my mother always grows back.
to soak sun and hold it in her cheeks.
thin colored all-brights, brilliant yellow
and that yellow faced dandelion will never die
but she will always dream of something more than those weeds.
until the day she realizes that a flower as beautiful as her
does not belong in a rose bush.

I absolutely love Perre Shelton... just a genuinely amazing slam artist.
I cannot get over how amazing this poem is. It really made me think of my mother and how much she is a 'dandelion'. Thank you Perre!The Party of Finger-Pointing
posted at 10:37 am on November 16, 2010 by Slublog
It was the 1880s, and Woodrow Wilson was depressed.
The academic had not seen his party hold the White House since the 1860s. Since the end of the Civil War, the Democrats had been in the political wilderness. Wilson was a Ph.D. candidate in history and political science, so he decided to do some soul searching to discover why the Democratic party had lost the support of the American people. The results of his research?
The Democrats weren’t wrong…the government was just.
This is a familiar refrain, often sung by the Democrats: our policies aren’t the problem – those who wrote the founding documents of this country created a system that is just too darn hard for a president or Congress to negotiate. So, so unfair.
Then Democrat Grover Cleveland was elected president, and suddenly…Wilson regained his faith in the American system. America was governable again! Sixteen years later, Wilson was elected president and promptly forgot every political theory he once espoused. Out? Cynicism about the government. In?
Fascism progressive government.
It was April 1980, and Lloyd Cutler was depressed.
The counsel to President Jimmy Carter had watched Congress and the American people turn on the president he served. Like Wilson, he decided to do some soul searching to discover why the Democratic party had lost support. The results of his research?
A particular shortcoming in need of a remedy is the structural inability of our government to propose, legislate, and administer a balanced program for governing. In parliamentary terms one might say under the U.S. Constitution it is not now feasible to ‘form a government.’ The separation of powers between the legislative and executive branches, whatever its merits and 1793, has become a structure that almost guarantees stalemate today. As we wonder why we are having such a difficult time making decisions we all know must be made and projecting our power and leadership, we should reflect on whether this is one big reason.
Shockingly, Cutler lost his cynicism by 1994, when he served as counsel to President Bill Clinton.
It is 2010, and here we are again.
A young Democrat president who ran on a platform of hope and change just had his domestic policies repudiated by the American people in a midterm election. His recent diplomatic efforts have not been successful. Once again, the opportunity to do some soul searching and discover why the Democrats have lost favor with the American people presents itself. A national political reporter researches the issue. His conclusion?
The issue is not President Obama. The presidency is just too darned hard..”
So the issue is that Obama doesn’t have any downtime?
This is an unfortunate pattern for the Democrat party. They have repeatedly refused to engage in any meaningful self-reflection in defeat. Their losses are far too often blamed on anything other than their own failure to govern in a way that reflects the will of the American people. When their policies are rejected by voters, the country suddenly becomes ‘ungovernable’ or the presidency becomes too much for one person to accomplish. To the latter argument, I offer a simple rebuttal:
Ronald Reagan somehow found the time to run the country and deal with the Soviet threat, and survived an assassination attempt. His was not an easy presidency, but it was, overall, a successful one. When Reagan was in office, the president never asked whether the job was too hard, or whether the country had become ungovernable. They didn’t have to.
The presidency is a difficult job and this country demands quite a bit from its presidents. Perhaps it is time for the Democrats to demand more from orr on November 16, 2010 at 10:56 AM
Job too Hard? It is said that Reagan slept through Cabinet meetings. I know I would.
Skandia Recluse on November 16, 2010 at 10:57 AM
Lincoln had down time? Lichtman is clueless. Lincoln was besieged by office visitors on a daily basis. He spent hours every day listening to the complaints and requests for favors of ordinary citizens who could walk in off the street to talk to him. Meahwhile, he had an enormous war to fight, the outcome of which would determine the survival of the Union, all the while handling all of the other minutiae of running a country. And he had exactly two staffers to help him. Two. Furthermore, he had to help take care of a young son who was dying and a manic-depressive wife. Yeah, Lincoln had all kinds of down time. It was a 24-hour vacation being the president in 1861.

Progressive vs. Oppressive
Which is a better term for our socialist friends?
Progressive means the same thing, except that it sounds better
So follow along folks:
A Tyrant does not believe In the limits of Constitutional government – things like restricting free speech, the right of self defense and having to respect those silly ideas on property rights.
A government with unlimited power soon becomes Tyrannical – in other words: Oppressive.
Chip on November 16, 2010 at 1:58 PM
Why should we expect anything else from a Party driven by an “other-directed” ideology – no one does anything because they want to; they do it because they are driven by circumstances, their environment, or pressure from others in the community – that says no one needs to accept personal responsibility for anything they do.
Rep Rangel can walk out of a Congressional Hearing because he doesn’t have a lawyer – it wasn’t his fault he spent all the money he stole on his previous representation.
The President doesn’t need to look at what he did wrong – after all, that thought never occurred to him – he only needs to look at the Bible and gun clutching ingrates that didn’t understand him.
Poor, poor Barack!
Frank_D on November 16, 2010 at 2:09 PM
The progressives’ problem with the founding documents and separation of powers highlights both their elitist belief system and the resulting totalitarian bent.
Their repeated attempts to undermine our system of government would at a minimum disqualify them from any leadership positions, if not for an allied and corrupt legacy media.

With regard to President Reagan, I seem to remember that he came in, delegated power to his cabinet and allowed them to act on their own initiative. And I also seem to remember that he was roundly criticized for trusting them so much and not micromanaging them.

As Ria Novosti reported Monday, Russia's state monopoly, Russian Railways, plans to participate in various railway projects worth of total nearly $3 billion in the Middle East and Africa. The Russian Railways' foreign projects subsidiary Zarubezhstroitekhnologia (ZST) expects to get a contract for about $250 million to electrify a 190 km railway in Iran, the head of the subsidiary Yuri Nikolsson said. "The talks about our participation in several rather interesting projects in Iran are being held. One of the projects stipulates a contract of about $250 million," he told Prime news agency.
The company's current projects include electrification of the Tabriz-Azarshahr railway which is almost completed, he added. The projects will be implemented by ZST, Nikolsson said.
The company has great prospects in the Persian Gulf where countries of that region are planning infrastructure construction worth about a $1 trillion. The Arab countries are going to unite the entire region with a railway network, Nikolsson told Prime news.
As for the concrete projects with the Arab states, the subsidiary is going to bid for a $2 billion railway construction project near the U.A.E. capital of Abu Dhabi. The city government wants to have 700 kilometers of railways to transport mainly cargo at a speed of 150-160 kph. "It was announced that there would be a railway, railway stations, depots, and the entire necessary infrastructure. [According to the project,] the railway must be ready in 2015 and all infrastructures in Abu Dhabi must be completed in 2016," he said.
Results of the tender will be known in August or September 2012. If the ZST wins the tender, there will be from 150 to 200 Russian engineers working at the project, Nikolsson said. The ZST also plans to bid for a $3-4 billion light metro network project in Kuwait, for railway projects in Saudi Arabia and Bahrain. "After Dubai built light metro, almost all countries of the Persian Gulf want to do the same," Nikolsson added.

version 2.8.5.2Page loaded in 0.398 secondsI sat stunned as I read the "Right to not match Ryan White funding" letter in Monday's Your Views section of The News.
The writer dismisses the "innocent" contractors of AIDS in one sentence, but spends a paragraph condemning to death the "lifestyle choices" of others.
Ryan White was a 13-year-old hemophiliac who contracted AIDS from a tainted blood transfusion, and falls squarely into the innocent category. The incongruous nature of the very next line in the sentence sickens me: "Why, however, is it the taxpayers' responsibility .¤.¤.?" The letter writer's true sentiment was so lightly veiled, I'm astonished it was committed to paper; heartless and uncaring, wrapped so thinly in "grieving" verbiage, it was an attempt to justify her own beliefs that AIDS is the gay/drug users' disease, and AIDS sufferers don't deserve public help nor public support.
It is this type of ignorance that caused an innocent boy to live out his dying days as the target of very public hatred and fear.
Pandemics, and the horrible suffering associated with them, aren't going to respond to the proffered reprimands "make better choices" and "abstinence is key." They respond to research, dedication and support.
Nonsupport of the legislation was that writer's right. But packaging it as a heartfelt response was disingenuous at best.

AIDS funding: Alabama out of step
A Monday letter to the editor advocates against public funding for HIV relief/treatment via the Ryan White Care Act. The act is the United States' largest federally funded program for people living with HIV/AIDS and provides funding to low-income, uninsured and underinsured HIV sufferers.
The act was first authorized in 1990 and reauthorized under President George W. Bush in 2006. Alabama is out of step with most states and our previous president in failing to provide matching funds in its 2010 budget. Consequently, Alabama will lose $10 million from the federal government for care of folks with HIV.
The letter writer's rationale for not providing matching money is that contracting AIDS is a result of poor lifestyle choices. She makes allowances for "innocent" HIV victims. As opposed to those who deserve it?
My heart goes out to the letter writer's family members who lost a cousin to HIV. They are due empathy and compassion. In the future, should the writer succumb to a devastating lifestyle disease (i.e., cancer due to smoking, heart problems due to poor diet and lack of exercise), I hope her relatives support her rather than throw her under the bus.
Jesus had a lot to say about love, forgiveness and casting stones.

President Obama: Pulling country radically leftward
It is truly frightening how quickly our president is pulling our country radically leftward. His election hinged on a few catchy phrases, and his inexperience, radical ideology and arrogance were glossed over.
President Barack Obama's recent judicial nomination neatly sums up his disregard for the Constitution. Knowledge of the law, impartiality and experience are not as important as "empathy," a liberal code for judicial activism.
In a matter of three months, Obama has attempted a takeover of the banks, car companies and credit lenders. He has weakened us with his self-righteous attacks on enhanced interrogation. Obama is planning a massive tax increase via the cap-and-trade bill, with its focus on "global warming." This is merely another attempt by the socialists to gain control of our economy.
The big coming attraction is universal health care, a sure-fire way to destroy not only our excellent medical system, but our economy as well. Attempts to label Obama a Marxist are ridiculed as right-wing extremism. Read Marx's 10 goals for communism in his Manifesto, and then see how ridiculous those charges are.

Grocery tax: Thanks for not removing fair tax
Applause to the members of the state Legislature who wisely rejected again the removal of the state sales tax on groceries. In my opinion, that is the fairest tax of all.
Many reports tell us that more than 40 percent of the people in the United States do not pay any taxes. Yet these people use our schools, roads, garbage services, etc.
Would they have the rest of us, who are already taxed to the hilt, pay even more for them? Where would we get the already evident deficit for our schools if the tax on food were removed?

Grocery tax: Sales tax most equitable of all
Everyone has a favorite tax to hate, but most people dislike taxes in general because of the waste we see every day by our elected leaders. We all spend a lot of time and money trying to minimize our tax burden. I know people who will spend $5 for gas to go to a city or county to save $3 in sales tax. Of all the taxes we pay, sales taxes are, in fact, the most fair and equitable of all.
Property taxes are the most arbitrary and egregious of all the taxes. Our economy is comprised of the "open bright light of day" economy and the "underground" economy. An indisputable fact is that the more one taxes the "open" economy, the more one drives economic activity to the "underground" economy. Until we do something to quantify and tax the "underground' economy, we should not add taxes to the "open bright light of day" economy.
Once we address the "underground" economy and tax it accordingly, I believe we will be able to provide tax cuts for food and property and have money left over.

Guantanamo: Why so scared of detainees?
The debate over shutting down the Guantanamo Bay detention center and transferring the inmates to a prison has left me utterly amazed at the cowardice of both our Congress and a large number of the American people.
Do they honestly believe the people we're holding at Guantanamo are some kind of supervillains? That they have superhuman powers, the ability to change their shape or size, walk through walls, or control others through their superior mental powers? Come on, people, they're a bunch of generally uneducated religious fanatics who, in most cases, don't even speak English.
The ADX Florence supermax facility in Colorado houses a wide variety of ultraviolent prisoners, including terrorists, Mafia hit men, drug cartel leaders and murderous gang members. If they can safely keep these monsters under control (there has never been an escape), I think they can handle a bunch of Third World goat herders, no matter how dangerous they are.

Working mothers: Love, not greed, motivated mother
A recent letter writer ("Greed leading women to work," May 16) accused many mothers of taking on a career because of purely selfish motives. I couldn't disagree more with her argument.
My mother, a very successful nurse who now makes a healthy salary, was forced to go to work back in the 1980s right out of nursing school. She didn't do it because she wanted a Prada bag or because she needed to drive a Lexus; her motives were to ensure that my sister and I were taken care of. My father was always present and held a full-time job of his own, yet we rented our first and second houses because their incomes were somewhat meager.
My mother, through very hard work and determination, gained experience, training and certifications that enabled her to earn much more. The result was she put us into a private school, wanting us to have the best education available, not the status she was seeking. The rewards of my mother's hard work are evident today, though she and my father both live in a modest house that still has a mortgage.
Of all the words used to describe my mother and grandmother, who both worked to support their families, greed would not be the one. I attribute it to this one: love.

Working mothers: Women at work not cause of recession
All mothers work. Some are paid by wages, some with intangibles, some receive both.
I am a mother who works, a decision I made with my husband and one that no mother makes lightly. Women who work are motivated by myriad reasons. Some don't have the option not to work. Some want to help provide for their families. Others would miss the intellectual challenges that can be presented by employment.
Some work to help/heal others, while some teach our children so each can contribute to society. Some women like the economic independence.
I was saddened by a recent letter ("Greed leading women to work"). Women who work are not the recession's cause, and the call for women to stop working will not solve the country's economic problems.
I am proud to live in a country that allows women to choose their paths. I have many talented friends who are lawyers, doctors, accountants, secretaries and teachers, and others who stay at home with their children. All are mothers.
Women make significant contributions to their families, to their vocations and to their communities, no matter the circumstances. Women should be lifting each other up for their accomplishments, not tearing each other down.

Id love one for my pb or my torch 9800 !
I'd love to win a free charging pod :)
I really really want/need a rapid charger for my PlayBook. I use it all day, plus I bought the convertible case for it and it can't stand up and charge at the same time because of port positioning, so a magnetic rapid charger would solve this issue as it is at 90 degrees with the stand instead of perpendicular. For those that say just flip the PB around - I use my headphones port all the time as well, so that doesn't work. I'd love to be win one.
I need to win at least once! lol

WILMINGTON,NC (WWAY) — Ty Walker won the 4-A state championship as a New Hanover Wildcat in 2007. His senior season at New Hanover ended a bit prematurely in the state playoffs in 2008. Walker chose to attend Wake Forest on a basketball scholarship. His college career was about to wrap up this month. Unfortunately actions by Ty Walker have caused a premature end to Ty Walker’s senior season at Wake Forest. Essentially his college basketball days at Wake are over.
WINSTON-SALEM,NC (Wake sports release) — Wake Forest senior center Ty Walker has been suspended for the remainder of the season due to a violation of departmental policy regarding student-athletes, announced head coach Jeff Bzdelik on Friday.
“Unfortunately it has become necessary to suspend Ty Walker for the conclusion of the season,” said Bzdelik. “He will finish up classes this semester and is on target to graduate in May.”
Walker played in 20 games with 13 starts for the Demon Deacons in 2011-12. He averaged 4.2 points, 4.6 rebounds and 2.6 blocks per game. Walker sat out the first nine games of the season due to a violation of the Wake Forest University student code of conduct.
We’ve also posted a link to a Winston-Salem Journal article below.
Here’s a story that WWAY’s Jesse Jones did on Ty Walker earlier this year when WWAY caught up with Walker in Durham.

what the violation was. Likely will never be disclosed.
But it must have been significant to be slammed off the team with a final game & the ACC Tournament still on the horizon.
History has shown any team has the potential to be motivated and play way beyond its expected level given the right venue. Remember the Pack & Coach V?
So to throw a Senior from the squad, there must have been a major
No-NO.
And that will influence his Pro prospects, if there ever were any.Holy shit, kids!! Markus Zusak, author of one of the best books EVER (pictured left) is going to be at the Dallas Museum of Art's "Arts & Letters Live" literary festival!! He's coming to town on April 22nd and you can bet your butt I will BE THERE. Many of you have read and loved The Book Thief as much as I did and can understand the excitement I'm feeling at this very moment. *squeeeeel* For those who have not read it, go buy it. Now. In case you've forgotten, it was my favorite book of 2006.
Thanks to Iliana for reminding me of this yearly festival that I always seem to forget or otherwise miss out on.
For more on Arts & Letters Live click HERE.
This looks terrific! I'm going to have to read this book.
Awesome! And he's so cute too, in a totally boyish sort of way. Oh I wish I could go too! North Carolina is SO boring!
I immediately thought of you and Heather! :)
I'm hanging my head in shame that I haven't read this book yet but I promise I will. Actually I even recommended it to my Foreign Authors book group so we will be discussing it sometime later this year. Can't wait.
I have to admit I've never read the book but I'm going to. Your raving reviews are making me so curious. I love a good book!
Lisa, yes you do! It's fantabulous.
Heatheroo, I don't think I've noticed. I'll have to Google him. This would be a good time for a Texas vacation, no? lol
Iliana, jump on it! You'll loooove it.
Funky, I think you'll adore it. It's an engrossing read.
That is great. I can't wait to read this and I am the Messenger. Both are being read by others now but will soon be in my hands to savor and enjoy.
Good, Carl! I can't wait to hear what you think of The Book Thief. I haven't gotten hold of I Am the Messenger yet, but it's high on my priority list!
I would love to go, as I mentioned in the OTPS post, but looking at my calendar last night I realized we'd be in VA for THE trial. Shit. Yet another reason why I really, really hate a certain person. Maybe the trial will be continued once again. I doubt it, though. We're going on almost 2 years by the time it gets underway. Damn, damn, damn.
I bought this book when it first came out, and initially picked it up because of the title. It's been getting raves EVERYWHERE, but you know what?! I CAN'T FIND MY COPY!!!!! It's in my basement, somewhere, but WHERE?!?!

Hi...I left a comment in the comment section in your previous post...and am still kinda curious about that.
Geez, Les. The law is REALLY slow, eh?? I'll be thinkin' about y'all.
Oh NO, Lisa!!!! LOL That sounds like something I'd do. I could've sworn I had a copy of The Tattooed Girl around here somewhere, but I can't find it for the life of me. I broke down and re-purchased it for $3.00 the last time I was at the UBS. *sigh*
Yay, Heather!!!
Hi, WMY! Thanks for your comments. I answered your question (to the best of my ability, and involving quite a bit of conjecture) in the previous post's comment section.
I must be the only person in the world who didn't completely fall in love with this book. However, that doesn't mean I wouldn't be willing to go see him at the DMA...books + art = blissfully happy me!
It sounds pretty fascinating from the Amazon blurb. I'm going to order it and add it to my pile and later think, where the hell did this come from?
Jen, you may be the only one not to fall in love with it, but ya know what? Different strokes for different folks! Have you read Gregory Maguire? He's going to be at the DMA too!
Dale, how big is your pile? Be honest? I love it when people mention their towers of unread books.
Oh, too cool! I'm so envious of you, living in the real world (near a major metropolitan area where cool stuff happens).Perez Hilton

Corini took over from Domenico Di Carlo this week, who was sacked after five consecutive defeats.
“It is difficult to interpret this match, because there has been a change of management and often that means the players have no more alibis, so have to raise their game,” said Ferrara.
The Serie A Week 7 opener kicks off at 17.00 UK time, click here for a match preview.
“Chievo are a side who play good football and I expect them to be hungry for points, so we must continue the approach we’ve been having.
“Eugenio was my teammate at one stage, so I know him well. He is a Coach who likes to see his teams play well and can teach them about football. I don’t know if he can change something in their tactics, but he has got a great opportunity here and wants to make the most of it.
“Corini knows the Chievo environment well and can do wonderful things there. Obviously, I hope he starts impressing after playing against us!”
Maxi Lopez returns from a two-match ban, but Sampdoria are without the injured Eder, Nicola Pozzi, Andrea Poli and Juan Antonio.
“We all know the contribution Maxi gave to the side in the first few rounds. His return is important and I imagine he’ll want to make up for lost time,” continued Ferrara.
“I want us to continue playing as we have been, although I hope over time we’ll learn to be more cynical in some moments.”
Sampdoria squad for Chievo: Berni, Falcone, Romero; Berardi, Castellini, Costa, De Silvestri, Mustafi, Poulsen, Rossini; Krsticic, Maresca, Munari, Obiang, Renan, Soriano, Tissone; Estigarribia, Icardi, Maxi Lopez

Walk right out the back door to super bee lift and shuttle to center or west villages. Because Frisco is about a 5 minute drive we went there for groceries so we wouldn't have to buy meals at the resort. There is a restaurant right there and a couple ski rental shops, but the shuttle to center village for more variety is unbelievably easy and convenient. We were able to park in the underground garage so we didn't have to dig the car out after the snow. There was a laundry facility on our floor but we didn't use it so i cant speak for its reliability. However, the room is pretty small and "run down" is the phrase I'd use. There are trim pieces coming away from the wall that look like someone tried to repair it by taping it with masking tape at one time. The corners and edges of the room aren't vacuumed so they've accumulated dirt and hair, the blinds are falling apart. There is only one bathroom that is extremely small, but the whole room is small. We had to do a lot of backing up to let another person through. One of the mattresses tilted to the side so it looked like you'd fall off. Speaking of the mattresses, they were so uncomfortable that after a long day of skiing it wasn't very comforting. I almost wanted to sleep on the floor but I wasn't confident about its cleanliness. I'm by no means a picky person, I enjoyed my stay because it was convenient to the mountain. But if I were to do it again I'd stay in Frisco and park for free and use the free shuttle.Two Last Things

On the following pages of this section you will find information about feng shui for bedroom: feng shui bedroom colors, feng shui bedroom decorating, feng shui bedroom layout, feng shui bedroom pictures, feng shui bedroom design, feng shui master bedroom, bedroom furniture, children's bedroom, feng shui bedroom ideas, rules, photo, feng shui bed, pictures and wallpapers for bedroom
Bedroom is your ultimate intimate premise for sleeping and recharging your chi. According to Feng Shui, the way the furniture in a bedroom is arranged, as well as the colors and accessories chosen for its décor, can tell how two people are doing in a love relationship. Conversely, re-arranging the furniture in the bedroom and playing with colors and accessories, can help the couple relate to each other in ways that are more loving and which show equal respect for both partners.
All advice for couples also applies to single people looking for love. If you are single and wish to find the significant other, then decorate your room as if you already are; place side tables and lamps on both side of the bed. Accessorize in pairs and ensure that everything is symmetrical. Place loving items on the bedside tables such as a photograph (the photo should not be a family picture but of you and your partner), a pair of candles and a rounded (not spiky) leafed plant - remember to place a few pink or red accent in and around the bed to encourage romance.
From a yin-yang perspective, this is a more yin, quiet and peaceful environment ; where you need to feel protected. At the same time, there should be a good circulation of chi with the help of a lot of fresh air and clearance.
Here are some Feng Shui bedroom tips.
* Ideally, the bedroom should be as far away as possible from the front door.
* Chi flows between the door and any window, so avoid positioning your bed in the line of door and a window.
* Position your bed so that you can see the door from the place where you sleep. This gives you a deep sense of inner security.
* Place your bed far from the door, if it is possible,.
* Avoid sleeping with your head close to a window as your chi will dissipate through the window and you will feel more tired on awakening.
* Make sure you have a strong, stable headboard to help you protect your own chi while you are asleep.
* Make sure the bedside tables have rounded edges and not square to prevent cutting chi.
* Do not admit ceiling beams above the bed. They are a source of cutting chi. Some tips:
Paint the beams; drape fabric over the beams; hang bamboo flutes 2-3 inches below the beam to soften the load (the flutes are hung at a 45 degree angle to the beam with the mouthpiece downwards).
* Soft lighting is ideal. Avoid having ceiling lamps right directly over your bed.
* Pastel colors are ideal.
* Avoid sleeping with your image visible in a mirror. The worst variant of all is a mirror (TV/computer screen) at the foot of your bed.
* Place something beautiful that inspires you where you first look in the morning.
* Pay attention to what is under your bed. Keep the space clear.

By Will Goodbody, Science & Technology Correspondent
@willgoodbody
Happy Data Protection Day! Yes, today is the 8th Council of Europe Data Protection Day. The anniversary of the opening for signature of the Council of Europe’s 1981 Data Protection Convention, which Ireland signed in 1986. A day for celebration, for sure. Or is it?
Well on some levels, perhaps yes. We are fortunate to have a data protection framework at national and European level to enshrine our privacy rights in law. Fortunate too to have a body, in the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner, whose job it is to ensure that those rights are upheld and protected.
But the last few months and years have taught us much about privacy, particularly online privacy. And it hasn’t been a pleasant lesson. We’ve had several high profile significant data breaches, like for example at Loyalty Build last year. We’ve had to endure the growing trend of online, text and cold-calling spam, despite all the protections in place.
We’ve had international scandals, involving state run intelligence agencies like the NSA riding roughshod through privacy protections we all thought were in place to guard our data held by the biggest internet companies in the world.
And here at home we’ve even had a string of public bodies admonished for not putting appropriate data protection protocols and oversight in place. Just today, the Data Protection Commissioner publicly rebuked (not for the first time) the Department of Social Protection, saying he was “entirely unsatisfied” with their attitude towards privacy.
What’s very clear is that keeping our personal data safe is going to become more and more difficult, as our lives move further and further online. The only way to tackle that steady encroachment is with education, modern but reasonable fit-for-purpose data protection laws and a robust system of enforcement at every level.
It is against that background that it is somewhat hard to believe that two years after it proposed a major reform of EU data protection rules, the European Commission has yet to conclude a new deal. In fact, latest reports suggest it is a long way off being concluded and it will probably take until the end of this year. With a two year implementation phase, it will be at least 2017 before it bears fruit. Can you imagine how far the online world will have moved on by then, who will be collecting our data, and what they will be doing with it?
The old EU privacy regulations are over 20 years old and although they were designed for 1990s technology, have stood the test of time well, because they were well thought out. And devising new, enduring, well thought out legislation does take time. The new proposals carry many beneficial features, which will provide a strong privacy framework for the future – provided they aren’t watered down through a combination of political bickering and commercial lobbying.
But the lifeblood of the modern internet economy is trust. Without it, e-commerce is nothing. People here in Ireland may be becoming more accepting that the benefits of the web are accompanied by an inevitable reduction in privacy. But when it comes to their private information, most people have a red line beyond which they are not willing to let the state and companies go. And without strong modern rules, data protection authorities are left to defend that red line on our behalf with one arm tied behind their backs.
So while celebrating Happy Data Protection Day, and blowing out the candles, let’s make a wish that a new strong and well thought out EU privacy framework comes soon, before really significant irreparable damage is done.Select HTC phones to get unlocked bootloaders starting in August
Owners of the global HTC Sensation, the HTC Evo 3D for Sprint and the HTC Sensation 4G for T-Mobile will be the first to get the two-part update starting in August. The first part of the update is considered a maintenance release which more or less will prepare each device for the major update.
Part two will be the actual unlocking tool which will finish sometime in September, making this update a little bit of a dragged out process. The biggest hurdle of course is what the carriers will do. Will Sprint and T-Mobile allow devices with unlocked bootloaders on their network? That remains to be seen.
HTC not only made it clear that other devices will receive this update sometime down the road, but we can all expect to see devices shipping with unlocked bootloaders in the near future. Tell us what you think in the comments below.

well here you are like i thought you'd be..i had to chuckle.
what is HTC thinking!? how could they do that to all their loyal customers? why don't they just do it now? can't be too hard right Miz?
6. The_Miz (Posts: 1496; Member since: 06 Apr 2011)
What are you yapping about? I don't see HTC pulling out any bs excuses unlike Motorola. Course, now we're just missing Squiggly or whatever the hell his name is b***hing at me about how I am being stupid just because I said Motorola needs to stop making up excuses and just start unlocking their bootloaders.
8. Thump3rDX17 (Posts: 2160; Member since: 10 May 2010)
what excuse has Motorola made? they let everyone know they were interested in unlocking the bootloaders and later on told us when they were going to make it happen, that's JUST what HTC has done, they're even matching Motorola's time table for the unlocking process. your criticisms towards Motorola about how they're handling the situation are now completely void. it's irrefutable Miz.
9. SuperAndroidEvo (Posts: 4620; Member since: 15 Apr 2011)
I have to agree with Thump3rDX17. Motorola WILL unlock their bootloaders. HTC is showing some great support for their phones. I have had my HTC Evo 3D since June 24th & by late August they will unlock the bootloader, that is fantastic! It shows the commitment HTC has to its fan base & the commitment it has for the developer circle also. Motorola will follow in the same footsteps. Motorola would NEVER soil their relationship with their fan base. It’s only a matter of time!
11. The_Miz (Posts: 1496; Member since: 06 Apr 2011)
Nothing is void as Motorola are dragging their asses with the announcement. Oh and why not just make good on their promise and release the Droid 3 without locking the bootloader? Because without the unlocked bootloader, the Droid 3 is a subpar phone even though unlocking it won't change that.
You won't be able to rid if of the horrible Verizon bloat or change the launcher from that godawful motorblur.
I am telling it like it is - Motorola are making excuses.
12. Thump3rDX17 (Posts: 2160; Member since: 10 May 2010)
Miz, Miz, Miz...Motorola's made the same announement HTC has, well actually more like HTC made the same announcement Motorola's made because they let everyone when it was going to happen first.
i can say the same thing about the EVO 3D and the Sensation you know also the Droid 3 is faster than both of those phones. not trying to knock HTC about the bootloader buisness but they're not doing any better than Motorola when it comes to that.
oh and the "Motorola Application Platform" is better than ever.

Verizon htc phones need it as well
7. The_Miz (Posts: 1496; Member since: 06 Apr 2011)
r 10. gdubb (unregistered)
i don't understand why they waste their time locking the bootloader and mass producing a million products then coming back later and unlocking it, when they could just release it that way, then they could focus on making the phone better and getting out updates faster then worrying about bootloaders. this is all so stupid!Semiconductor sales in February up from a year earlier
Worldwide sales of semiconductors totaled $23.25 billion in February, a 1.4 percent increase from a year earlier, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association.
However, global sales were down 3.8 percent from January’s $24.17 billion, which reflects a seasonal trend, according to SIA data released Monday.
Year-to-date sales through February were 2 percent higher than the same time last year, the data showed.
“Despite persistent economic uncertainty, the global semiconductor industry is off to a promising start in 2013 -- led by strength in memory sales -- and is ahead of last year’s pace,” SIA President and CEO Brian Toohey said in a prepared statement. “To help spur stronger growth, Congress and the administration should invest in basic research to boost American innovation, reform the high-skilled immigration system to welcome the top scientific minds from around the world, and modify the tax system so businesses can expand, invest and hire new workers.”
The Phoenix area is home to numerous semiconductor manufacturers and related companies, employing more than 19,000 people. Local operations with a global presence include Intel Corp., Microchip Technology Inc., Freescale Semiconductor Inc. and ON Semiconductor Corp.
Year-over-year sales increased in the Asia Pacific region by 6.7 percent and in the Americas by 1.6 percent, but decreased in Europe by 1.5 percent and in Japan by 15.7 percent, according to SIA data.
From January to February, sales increased in Europe by 1.4 percent, but decreased in Asia Pacific by 3.6 percent, in Japan by 5 percent and in the Americas by 6.2 percent, the data showed.
SIA is a trade association representing the U.S. semiconductor industry, which one of the country’s top export sectors. The group’s data show the industry directly employs nearly a quarter-million people in the U.S. and accounted for more than $146 billion in sales in 2012.CNC Machining Centers, Lathes and Metalworking Machinery.

When ever I see them on tv or in stores I get very excited. I have even figured out how to push her belly to make her talk. I also really love shoes so any would be great. I think I've been a really nice little girl and even though we haven't hit it off just yet, don't be sat if I cry and don't wanna sit on your lap right now. I will enjoy you and wave at you from afar. Ok Santa it's past my bedtime, one last thing. Don't forget my big brother Dylon he's a pretty great big brother ...

Protects dogs eyes from shampoo
posted 6 years ago
I put this in my dog's eyes before giving her a bath so that the shampoo doesn't sting her eyes. I put a tiny amount on a swab and then dab the swab on the inside lower eyelid. She blinks a lot and it coats her eyes. I find that it seems to help her not get irritated eyes as opposed to when I don't use it and the shampoo gets in her eyes. Her eyes don't get red from the shampoo.
I use the swab method to apply so as to prevent contaminating the tube. The ointment is a little thick, and sometimes more thick in colder weather, so it can be difficult to get it on the swab, or on the eyelid.
This stuff is cheap enough and I feel it helps my dog during bath time.
Pros: Protects dogs eyes from shampoo
Cons: Sometimes hard to apply

I used this as one of the many medications on my blind poodles eyes. It works well to lubricate dry eye. Just wish it came in a bigger tube as I went through a lot of it.

The names include activists, intellectuals, journalists and politicians. Among them is Abraham Samad, the current chairman of the Anti-Corruption Commission, as a choice for Home Affairs Minister; Azyumardi Azra, a former rector at a state Islamic university as Religious Affairs Minister; and army chief of staff General Budiman, who was dismissed today by President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono ahead of his retirement in September, as an option for coordinating Minister for Politics, Law and Security.
Some of the names come from the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle, the party backing Mr. Widodo’s bid for the presidency. Many also come from current or past Cabinets. State-owned Enterprise Minister Dahlan Iskan and former Trade Minister Gita Wirjawan are both listed as choices for the Economic Coordinating Ministry.
The list also includes names from rival Prabowo Subianto’s camp, such as Ridwan Kamil, the young mayor of Bandung and a member of Mr. Subianto’s Gerindra Party.
Analysts say the move could be seen as part political – demonstrating that as a leader he will listen to average Indonesians – but also pragmatic, giving him leverage when dealing with traditional political parties in forming his government.
“He says he’s going to put the emphasis on a non-transactional Cabinet. But it can’t just be what he wishes,” said Doug Ramage, an analyst from Jakarta-based BowerGroupAsia who sees the move as savvy.
“It could be seen as a way to push back against pressures within his coalition or the party if he’s able to say ‘the people want this person for the Cabinet post’,” Mr. Ramage said.
The step shouldn’t be unexpected for Mr. Widodo whose campaign relied on a large and disparate network of volunteers to help canvass the vote and utilized social media to spread information about his proposed programs. One of his many slogans was “Jokowi adelah Kita” — Jokowi is Us.
But going outside the party structure and traditional patronage networks could prove tricky for Mr. Widodo as he works to build a government in a country where the political elite still hold sway.
“These realities of Indonesian politics, I don’t think we can assume Jokowi’s new approach to politics will overturn all of them,” said Mr. Ramage.
(Appendage: This post was updated to include a comment from Mr. Widodo).

One of the job descriptions for my work these days is that “I write code to test code”. And this sounds so familiar.
In a recent book “How Google tests software”, it is discussed in detail so as in what different ways Google engineers perform testing. The book is detailed and filled with practical experiences and it is not possible to explain the concept in this little window. But one thing is sure: almost every engineer there writes code to test code. Excerpts from Chapter 1 about the three dominant roles in engineering terms:
“SWEs (software engineers) write a lot of test code, including test-driven design (TDD), unit tests, …”
“SETs (software engineer in test) also spend close to 100 percent of their time writing code, but they do so in service of quality rather than coding features a customer might use.”
“Some Google TEs (test engineers) spend a good deal of their time writing code in the form of automation scripts and code that drives usage scenarios and even mimics the user.”
If I depict this picture as above where the numbered circles represent some engineer in a team, and that engineer may be totally focused on programming or testing activities, or it may have a mix.
The example from Google above means that they live by numbers 3, 5 & 4. (home work: relate these numbers with the roles mentioned above)
Some teams are against the idea of dedicated testers and they live by number 1, 3 & 5.
Some people are against the idea of “testers writing code”, they live by the number 1 & 2. But beware as more and more testing jobs need programming skills.
What are the numbers being used in your team? And how you think “write code to test code” is changing the numbers?

Development Team writes code and Testing Team verifies code written by developers by writing their own code but who verifies the tester code?
Are they always sure that the code written by testers are 100% correct?
I have my own experience in this regard but I would like some testers to comment on this.
Thanks for your opinion and you are spot on Akif. It is one of the paradoxes of software testing also known as ‘Who watches the watchman’.
The code that testers write can also have bugs and when our tests start failing, it can be a problem with our test code or it can be a problem with production code as well. So these kind of issues come along as you know every thing in life is like a ‘package’ and not all good.
There are reasons though, where tester’s code have less issues. 1) Testers are usually more conscious about quality 2) this layer is thin and 3) usually they follow a peer review mechanism. But still, ‘no code is bug free’ :)
Writing code to test code works most of the time if you are prepared to accept that the likelihood of both developer and tester making a mistake at the same place will be close to zero. If either or both make non-overlapping mistakes a defect is sure to be found which can then be investigated. Of course if both make a mistake in the same place as a result of interpreting the specifications then you could raise a defect against the documentation on the basis that clarification is required; of course you have to detect the fault first!
Thanks Ali for reinforcement. You are right that if two thinking heads look to test the same stuff, chances of quality work are more.
This makes sense to me but still there are minimal chances of defects being left. As there is nothing called bug free software (please correct if I am wrong) so we can live with that and on the identification it can be fixed in the next iteration.
Even though I have read, heard and experienced a lot on this issue, but as a test engineer my thoughts are still divided on the “Google-Way” of doing it. At one hand, I don;t want to let my test skills getting over shadowed by writing code in order to test a code. On the other hand, I don;t want test automation engineers to be the sole owner of automated test suites, and would prefer being on-board with the automation efforts. Writing test code is similar to writing piles and piles of documents to test an application;s functionality. Writing Test Specs and some 50+ pages of functional tests can probably make you a good documentation engineer, but test skills eventually start suffering and your documentation related issues get more focus than your test related issues (which should be your priority anyway). In either case, I am convinced that there has to be a balance. Yes, testers should be able to write code and document if needed, but this should not be their full-time focus.
I was waiting for your such comments Huma :)
You are absolutely right in mentioning the importance of ‘testing skills’ and that’s why we are not abandoning specialized testers. So what we want is that programmer try to learn some of these and hence step into Testing space. Similarly the proposal is that tester try to learn some of the programming skills and touch the Programming space.
Also agreed to your point of excessive test documentation time and I have some stuff ready on it. May be I should write a post dedicated on this topic of ‘less documentation and more work’.30-Apr-2014

THIRD EDITION
DEDICATED TO MY
DAUGHTER, MARGUERITE.
The old tattered flag, that passed through the siege of the "Civil War" which freed the colored race from slavery and saved the Union from disruption. The old flag was fought under by the colored as well as the white boys, and was preserved as the Nation's emblem of freedom. "Long may it wave o'er the land of the free and the home of the brave."
I present this work to the public on it's merits; there is no fiction about it, every incident is taken from reality. The author has either pasted through or been an eye witness to every trying ordeal and incident, with a very few exceptions, and he has authentic history to sustain him in these. Every line is dictated by the author, W. H Robinson, and written by his secretary, Miss Florence Mitchell, of Louisville, Kentucky.
Having read the within pages I can conscientiously recommend the book as being of intense interest from first to last; full of interesting narrative, valuable historical information, good suggestions and wholesome inspiration. It is more than worth the price asked for it.
J. M. GASS,
Editor "News," Albia, Iowa.

To Whom It May Concern:
It gives me pleasure to be permitted to state that the Rev. W. H. Robinson is personally known to me as a man whom God is most wonderfully using in the extension of His Kingdom. He is most favorably known in the state and enjoys the highest esteem of the churches. His evangelistic labors have been signally successful, churches being quickened, church members reclaimed and large numbers truly converted. His book I consider, of great value, presenting as it does, a vivid and truthful story of the remarkable manner in which God by his grace, can use one who is consecrated to the service of the Master
Yours very truly,
GEO. R. STAIR,
Pastor First Baptist Church, Eau Claire, Wisconsin... At the end of three weeks the gang of three hundred and fifty was made up and we were chained and started for Richmond, Virginia.. from me." She said, "good bye, child.". statue of George Washington, which stood at Richmond, Virginia, with a negro boy chained at its base, and Washington pointing with his right hand, saying, "take the negro south." This very great man, who, with Hancock, in 1776, signed the Declaration of Independence, and said the colonies were and ought to be free, loosed them from the iron hand of Great Britain; and yet that was the inscription written on his statue, which adorned the public square of the once Capitol of the Southern Confederacy..
These last two incidents remind me of the pilgrim in the following song:
"I saw a blood washed traveler in garments white assnow,
While traveling up the highway, where heavenly breezes blow;
His path was full of trials, but yet his face was bright,
He shouted as he journeyed, I'm glad the burden's light.
I saw him 'mong his neighbors, they mocked his soul's alarm;
The vilest wretch among them could scoff and do no harm;
Forsaken by his kindred and banished from their sight,
An outcast, yet he shouted, I'm glad the burden's light.
I saw him in the conflict, where all around was strife,
Where wicked men with malice, connived to take his life;
I saw him cast in prison, a dungeon dark as night,
And there I heard him shouting, I'm glad the burden's light.
I saw him led from prison, and chained unto the stake,
I heard him cry triumphant, 'tis all for Jesus sake.
I saw the fires when kindled, the faggots burning bright,
He said the yoke is easy, the burden is so light."
This is now the year of 1860. I was twelve years of age and had been a runaway twice in that time. I had now been at Lee's trader's pen four or five weeks, when one day I saw a man coming with a black horse and buggy; something from within seemed to whisper to me, "this is the man who owns your mother." My aspirations ran so high that I went out the back way and prayed that this might be he. He came into the office of the pen, and after a general conversation with Mr. Lee, he asked "if he had heard anything of that boy yet." I was watching every move and listening to every word passed. With a wink of the eye, Mr. Lee said, "no." Then he sent me to do something in the rear end of the building. I did it very quickly and returned to the office again; was very busily engaged with my dust brush. Never since I had been there had I found so much to be done in the office, and whenever I was sent away I would do my errand as quickly as possible and return to the office again.
Finally Mr. Hadley, for it was he, said: "boy, how would you like to belong to me and go down to Tennessee to live? While I was satisfied that he was the man who owned my mother, I said, "I wouldn't like to go with you at all, 'cause Massa Lee said the man that had my mother was coming after me." As I spoke I couldn't keep from crying, and Mr.
Lee could refrain no longer, so he said "William, this is Mr. Hadley, the man who has your mother, and brothers and sisters." And for once I saw that seemingly heartless man, who separated thousands of husbands and wives, mothers and children, sisters and brothers, touched to the very core, for he drew his handkerchief and wiped his eyes, instead of his nose, as he pretended to be doing.
Mr. Hadley was a very kind, fatherly acting man. He bought me a nice suit of clothes, and gave me money, telling me to buy my mother, brothers and sisters some presents. As a general thing all Jew slave owners were more lenient to their slaves than any other nationality, perhaps because they had been in bondage themselves. In a few days we started for home; we had to stop along the way in many little towns to attend to business, so that we were nearly four days in making the trip. These were four of the longest days I had ever experienced in my life, for I was anxious to meet my mother again. I was constantly inquiring "how much farther is it." On the fourth day in the afternoon I asked, "how long yet before we will reach home?" He said, "in a few days now." The words had scarcely left his lips, when I saw coming down the road my mother and new mistress. Mother came upon the side of the buggy my master was on, and almost dragged me out of the buggy across my master. She was rejoicing and blessing master for his deeds of kindness. In a few minutes my new mistress came up on the other side of the buggy; she pulled me over, and to my surprise, and for the first time in my
life, a white woman kissed me. This was a very new feature to me, and naturally embarrased me very much, so much so that I mentioned it many times afterwards. I couldn't understand how it was, I, a slave, and she my mistress, as others had been, and they were so heartless and cruel, and she so kind. But I afterwards learned that all the white people were not mean and cruel, for when I arrived home I found my mistress had prepared a grand dinner for us and invited in all the slaves. My mistress had two children, Samuel and Laura. I didn't call them master and mistress as I had heretofore called the white children, but called them each by their given name. I had a glorious time in that home and felt almost as if I were free. My master owned a large farm three miles from Greenville, where we lived. But during the month of February he concluded to go to the old country- - I think it was on account of the agitation of the slave question - he saw the war was coming on, so he decided to take us back to Wilmington and leave us there, with his wife and children, on his brother's farm, until he returned. Accordingly we all packed up and went back to Wilmington, N. C., my old birthplace. On arriving there we found another brother and sister, making mother and six children together again; father and the other six children we knew nothing of. Mr. Hadley went away but was gone only three weeks, when he returned, saying he had not gone any farther than Richmond, Virginia.
He stayed in Wilmington a month, and when he was ready to go back home he asked me and my sister
"if we didn't want to stay with his brother awhile longer and come home later on." We, not having the least suspicion that he had sold us, told him that we would. So they went home, leaving us. After a couple of weeks, Mr. Dave Hadley - that was his brother's name - told us that he had bought us, but we could go every two or three months to Greenville to see mother.
It was not more than two weeks from the time I found that Massa Dave Hadley had bought me, when Joseph Cowens, the son of my original old master, came to Mr. Hadley's; he met me out in the yard and stopped me for a talk. He said, "it was a shame that his father had allowed my father to be sold away, that he was going to buy us all back and get us together again."
With this conversation he naturally won me, so when he asked me if I wouldn't like to belong to him, of course I said "yes." He went into the house and in a short time be and Massa Dave came out together, and Massa Dave told me that I now belonged to Joseph Cowens, and that he bad bought my two brothers also, and in the next two months he was going to buy mother and the other two children. But when I got to his house and asked for my brothers, he said that he had hired them out for a year. I soon found out different; he had never bought my brothers, nor had any intention of buying them; or my mother, either.
I am now back in the Cowens family, my original master's son, and brother to Scott Cowens - the man I knocked off the porch for hitting my mother, and who was afterwards drowned. I went to Joseph Cowen's as general servant boy in the house, and was treated as well as could be expected from a Cowen. I stayed there quite satisfied, thinking that mother and the other children would come in a few months, as he had promised they would. The last of March we moved out on the Summer farm, three miles from town, and I had to drive him to town every morning and go for him every evening. He was a merchant and owned several ships. Now I had a great deal of freedom out on the farm, for I did nothing but drive Massa Joseph back and forth, to and from town, and wait table. I was in the cabins and among the slaves the most of my time in the day, but I slept at the "great house" in Massa Joseph's room. I had become almost a prophet among my people, because I would get the news from the white people, and in the day would tell it to the slaves in the fields and cabins.
He owned another farm five miles from town, and had a colored overseer on this farm. Uncle Tom was the meanest man you ever saw, in the presence of the white folks. He would draw back his whip as though he was going to knock down all around him,
but I never knew him to strike an old person in my life.
The leading white men from town would come out two or three nights in a week and stay half of the night and gamble. I would take the whiskey, glasses and water in to them, then Massa Joe would send me off to bed, but I stood many an hour listening to them talk and discuss the question of the war, and whether it would be advisable to arm the negroes. They finally decided, as did the Egyptians, that if they did arm the negroes when the enemy came the slaves would join with the enemy and fight against them, so they thought it would not be expedient to do so. About this time, or in February, 1861, delegates from South Carolina, Alabama, Georgia, Louisana and Texas, met at Montgomery, Alabama, and formed a government called the Confederate States of America. Jefferson Davis, of Mississippi, was chosen president. Davis came to Wilmington and was given a great ovation, and in his speech he appealed very strongly to the ladies; he asked, "which lady there was not willing to give her husband, son, brother or sweetheart, to go upon the battle field and fight for their rights." The women became frantic with their cries, "I will give mine," "I wouldn't marry a man who wouldn't go," etc. Then he made another appeal to the ladies, asking "which one of them would like to live to see the day when a nigger wench would be on equality with them?" At this point they grew raving mad, ante cried, "they never wanted to see that day." Jeff said he would wade in blood to his saddle skirts rather
than live to see that day, and yet he tried to escape in his wife's skirts.
About this time the laws were very strict on the slaves, and they were not allowed a pass to go to a public gathering of any kind. Men who belonged to one man and whose wives were owned by another, and had been given a pass every Saturday night to go to see them, were now permitted to go only once a month. But the slaves would slip off to church and frolics and the patrollers were continually after them, but the slaves would play all kinds of tricks on them. I remember one time while at a prayer meeting in an old deserted cabin on the back part of a farm the slaves were singing and praying, but had several stationed all around the house, watching. They saw the patrollers coming and notified those in the house, and to my surprise five or six men had shovels, and each man got a shovel full of hot embers out of the fireplace and stood at the door and windows. They continued to sing and pray until the patrollers got to the door and ordered it opened. One man snatched the door open while the others threw the fire all over them; when the patrollers recovered consciousness the slaves were all gone.
At another time I went to a dance in the woods; the music consisted of tambourine, banjo and bones, but before the dance began they tied grapevines across the road, just high enough to catch a man riding horse back across the face or neck. When they heard the patrollers coming they ran, and the patrollers right after them; many of them were crippled, but not a
slave was hurt or caught, So you see, there were some negro as well as Yankee tricks.
The slaves would have to devise many schemes in order to serve God. Of course they had church once or twice a month, but some white man would do the preaching, and his text would always be, "Servants obey your masters," But this was not what our people wanted to hear, so they would congregate after the white people had retired, when you would see them with their cooking utensils, pots and kettles, go into a swamp and put the pots and kettles on the fence, with the mouths turned toward the worshipers. They would sing and pray, the kettles catching the sound. In this way they were not detected. I did not learn until just before the war why they carried the vessels with them to worship.
In order to notify the slaves on other farms when there was going to be a meeting they would sing this song, and the slaves would understand what it meant. White people would think they were only singing for amusement:
"Get you ready, there's a meeting here tonight." Matt. 7: 16.
1 Get you ready, there's a meeting here tonight,
Come along there's a meeting here tonight,
I know you by your daily walk,
There's a meeting here tonight.
2 Oh, hallelujah, to the lamb,
There's a meeting here tonight,
For the Lord is on the given hand,
There's a meeting here tonight.
3 If ever I reach the mountain top,
I'll praise my Lord and never stop,
Get you ready, there's a meeting here tonight.
4 Go down to the river when you're dry
And there you'll get your full supply,
Get ready, there's a meeting here tonight.
5 You may hinder me here,
But you cannot there,
God sits in heaven
And he answers prayer.
There's a meeting here tonight.
They would carry with them iron lamps, with a greasy rag for a wick, and they would attach a sharp spike to the lamp so as to stick it in a tree. In this way they would light up the swamp, while they held their meeting.
SLAVEOWNERS' WORSHIP.
Air - any long metre.
"Come let us join, our God to praise,
Who lengthens out our fleeting days.
The shades of one more night have passed
Which has to many been the last.
And thus, Kind Providence, it seems,
Has kept us through our midnight dreams.
Our dogs have guarded well the door
And Lord, what could we ask Thee more?
Thy promise, Lord, has been our stay;
Not e'en a slave has run away,
While scores have left on every side
To seek Lake Erie's doleful tide.
O! grant us, Lord, a great display
Of Thy rich mercies through this day.
May we in strength our work pursue,
And love Thee as slave-holders do."
Let us unite in prayer:
"Supremely great, and worthy of all adoration art Thou, O Lord, our heavenly Father. The cattle upon a thousand hills, and the negroes in a thousand fields are Thine. We
thank Thee, Lord, for the manifold blessings with which Thou art supplying us, Thine humble and obedient servants, notwithstanding our merits deserve them all, for Thou hast said the righteous shall enjoy the good of the land. Now, Lord, we have not much time to pray, for Thou see'st how those devilish slaves are squandering away their time. Lord, revive Thy work in our midst. Grant us all a large increase of slaves for the traders this fall, that we may obtain the means, through Thy well directed providence, to rear Thee a magnificent temple in which Thou wilt love to dwell, and where Thou wilt love to pour out Thy spirit upon Thy Zion. O! Lord God, when we go into the fields among those ignorant, hard headed creatures, (over whom Thou hast made us to rule), may Thy glory so shine in our countenances that one of us shall subdue a thousand, and bind ten thousand upon the racks from the ungovernable malice of enraged negroes. Deliver us from the influence of a guilty conscience; deliver us from the abolition creeds, and from the slanderous tongues of enthusiastic politicians. Deliver us from insurrections and perplexity of minds, good Lord, deliver us. Give us and our dogs our daily bread, and our negroes their full pecks of parched corn or cotton seeds per week. Strengthen the horse and his rider, and make the limbs of the fugitive weak. Confound the cunning schemes of anti-slavery men. Bless the government which Thou didst redeem from the British yoke of oppression, and didst wash and make clean by the precious blood of the heroes of '76. Bless the star spangled banner, which floats over the land of the free and the home of the brave. May her stars increase in number and brightness, and eagle's wings be extended o'er all the virgin soil of our continent until his beak shall pick the fugitive from his lurking places in the cold regions of British
America, while his tail shall overshadow the slaves in Yucatan. And may his pinions cast their pleasant shade over all the free born sons of America, from Providence to Monterey, while he shall bear in his mighty talons, for ages to come, four millions of ignorant slaves with all their posterity. Hear us, good Lord, and according to Thy manifold mercies, bless and sanctify us. Give us more than we are able to ask for at this time, and in the end save all the white people who have supported Thy holy institution and performed Thy will, through Jesus Christ, our Redeemer, Amen."
THE SLAVE HOLDERS' HYMN TO BE SUNG AT EVENING PRAYERS. (Short Metre.)
"A charge to keep I have,
A negro to maintain.
Help me, O Lord, whilst here I live,
To keep him bound in chain.
We thank Thee, Lord, for grace
That's brought us safe this far,
While many of our dying race
Were summoned to Thy bar.
No negroes have I lost -
Not one has run away.
I have been faithful to my trust
Through this, another day.
Lord, we cannot lie down
Till we implore Thy grace,
For if we do a mighty frown
Will cover o'er Thy face.
Draw nigh, just now, O Lord,
And listen while we pray,
And each petition - every word,
Pray Answer and Obey.
Copied from imagination's parchment roll, where this, and many other things, have been on perpetual record from childhood. Ficticious, as it is, and as ridiculous as it may appear, I defy any minister, white or black, who preaches to the slaves in the south, to preach any better doctrines and have his preaching harmonize with the institution of slavery. The whole sentiment is consistent with slavery, and the old experienced southerner will read many things in this discourse which he has heard before. This is preached more generally on the Sabbath, previous to the usual holidays by the "Rt. Rev. Bishop Policy."
"Well, darkies, I am happy to see so many shining eyes, and greasy faces today. It speaks two great truths; first, that you are all awake to your own welfare; and secondly, that your masters treated you well and gave you meat. You have come out today to hear the word of God. I hope you will pay strict attention to what is said, and treasure it up in good and honest hearts. My text is not taken directly from the Bible, that is, not our Bible, but yours. We all respect your Bible more than we do the white man's Bible, or otherwise the word of God, for your Bible you can obey, but ours you cannot. The text is recorded in the laws of Maryland, A. D. 1715, Chapter 44, Section 22. "All negroes and other
slaves already imported, or hereafter to be imported into this province, and all children born, or hereafter to be born of such negroes and slaves, shall be slaves during their natural lives." In the first place, I shall show God's wisdom displayed in the system of slavery. Second, the master's great responsibility. Third and last, the consequence of disobedience. God's wisdom is displayed in the system of slavery. The text declares positively that you shall all be slaves during your natural lives. What a great blessing God has brought to you, my colored friends, through the economy of His divine grace. A greater blessing never was conferred on mortals. From the birth of Adam until the present day we are taught in our Bible that God wrought miracles upon the Egyptians - brought the children of Israel over the Red Sea - preserved them in the wilderness in safety. But by and by they entered into the land of Canaan, a land of freedom, and immediately they began to have trouble and discord. But you, my colored friends, have been prepared with a perpetual home through life. You are as trees planted by the river of waters, whose branches fail not. O that you might praise the Lord for his goodness and for His wonderful works toward you black people.
Again, God's wisdom is displayed in the institution of slavery, in its great plan of perpetuating the negro race. "The white men, the masterpiece of God's creation." when tracing nature through various windings, while the good Samaritans were seeking upon the face of God's earth for objects of pity and compassion, somehow, very mysteriously, were wafted by the kind breezes of heaven to the burning shores of Africa. There they found the sooty tribes of that hot climate very much degraded. At first they scarcely knew what to call them; they so much resembled the orangoutang
as to cause a great controversy among God's people. Finally they were seen to bow with reverence and adore an image of their own making. Again, they were seen warring, slaying and eating each other, and sacrificing one another by thousands to their deities.
This disposition was so much like that of the low class of whites that they felt the spirit of pity and compassion move towards those poor God forsaken creatures, and a plan was immediately formed for their protection and elevation. They were at once taken on board ship, kindly treated, and safely brought to America, where they were put in the care of kind men who provided for them, clothed and fed them, and comforted them in sickness and in health. And here you have been until the present day. Now you can see what God has done for you in instituting this system of slavery. You were found an ignorant set, no top on your heads - and it is doubtful whether you had any soul - more than the apes that played around you. But through the economy of God's grace you have been transplanted upon American soil, and through much toil on the part of the white man, you are becoming quite intelligent. The white man, through amalgamation, has not only imparted to you his straight hair, high nose, blue eyes, thin lips and perfect form, but it is to be hoped that you have a soul much resembling his, which will, by his care and attention, and your obedience to his precepts, stand a great chance to be admitted upon the ground floor of God's glorious temple in heaven - this is better than a thousand lives in Africa, and who would despise his chains, which are but for a moment, and then passeth away - for the blessings which flow out of the system of slavery. The text declares that you shall be slaves your natural lives, which may signify that it is your
nature to be slaves. That is, that you are created to be servants of the white man, and all the children to be born of you are to be slaves. Yes, Susan, that little blue-eyed boy you are now trotting upon your knee - the express image of his young master Thomas, is to be a slave, and should you ever see the least disposition of his young master exciting his aspirations to freedom, you must crush that disposition immediately, and repeat to him the language of the text.
Again God's wisdom is displayed in making you with strong constitutions. See what large, robust, fat, greasy looking fellows you all are. See what clear, white teeth you have. Just look at me. See what a puny, slender, delicate, pale looking creature I am, my teeth all decayed. I could not crack parched corn and cotton seeds and get fat like you all do. If I should take a hoe or pitchfork in my hands they would be soiled, and if I should work an hour they would be blistered so badly that I could not correct a slave again for a month. Just look at my hand now. The other day I took hold of a rough cowhide without my gloves on, and gave a young impudent wench, who told my wife something, forty lashes, and it raised this great blister you see. I was never made to work. Look at those great, broad-sided, good, healthy looking wenches sitting before me. What arms they have. Any of them can work from daylight until dark in the field, when the sun is so hot that the overseer has to ride under an umbrella, and your mistress would almost faint just walking out in the garden. Thus, you can plainly see that God has not made the white man to work. He is only to think, plead law, make laws, preach, pray, and carry the gospel to the heathen, and superintend God's works, while the blacks were made to do the hard and dirty work. For this
they hard constitutions peculiarly adapted. But again; God's wisdom is further displayed in the economy of slavery by creating you void of natural affections, as regards family sociability, and maternal and parental love for your husbands, wives and children. Therefore, our conscience is void of offense toward God or you negroes, when we separate the husbands from their wives and children, for it is for the purpose of rearing up fine temples for the glory of God and his Kingdom.
O, tell me papa, when mother dies,
Will she come home again?
Or will we meet above the skies,
Where Christ the Savior reigns?
Would you not like to die tonight,
If mother, too, would die?
And with sweet angels dressed in white,
Meet her above the sky?
FATHER.
O, yes, my child, my life is dear,
And you I love full well;
But I no longer can tarry here,
I soon will bid this world farewell;
I cannot live, my heart is broke,
My grief is more than I can bear;
This very strap and that great oak;
Will end my life in deep despair.
Early Friday morning, April 12, 1861, I took my master to Wilmington. On the way we stopped and took in another man. As we neared Wilmington we could hear the booming of cannons, for the rebels had fired upon Ft. Sumter, and we could hear the echo of the guns as it came down the Cape Fear river and was
borne out on the broad bosom of the Atlantic. My master, in great excitement, slapped his hands together, and with an oath, said, "its come." Both of them grew deathly pale, and looked at each other as though they were surprised. My master hastily wrote a short note, sealed it and gave it to me, with directions to hurry home, cautioning me very particularly not to stop until I reached home and delivered the note to his wife.
I saw that every white man in Wilmington was greatly agitated and wore a look of anxiety. In a moment everything that had been told me by the Yankee soldiers, and by the underground railroad men, flashed in my mind; for many of them had told me that I would some day be free, and we looked forward to that day with great expectations.
I drove as fast as I could to the five mile farm, which was in charge of the colored overseer. Uncle Tom could read and write, and I wanted to know what was in the note. I had many times slipped him the newspapers from the house, and carried them back early the next morning before master called for them, and he taught me to listen carefully to every conversation held between the white people. I drove up to the fence, where fifty or sixty men and women worked in the field. I could hear them singing and shouting, for they too, had heard the booming of the cannon, and Uncle Tom had told them that that was a token of liberty. But when they saw the old "carry-all" drive up, each one ran to his or her work; the overseer came to the carriage, supposing master wanted to see him,
but to his surprise master was not there. He called the slaves around and had me explain how master acted at the sound of the guns, then he made a speech to them, telling them to pray as they had never prayed before. I gave him the note I had for mistress; he looked at the envelope, studied for a moment, rubbed his head, and then thoroughly wet the seal; he opened the letter and read it. The letter read as follows:
"We have fired on Fort Sumter. I may possibly be called away to help whip the Yankees; may be gone three days, but not longer than that. You write a note and send William to Sawyer, [that is the overseer on the farm where we live] and tell him to keep a very close watch on the negroes, and see that there's no private talk among them. Have Martin, the overseer's son, aid you, and if Elliott or Fuller come on the place, give them no opportunity to talk with the negroes.
Your husband,
JOE COWENS."
(This Fuller referred to in the note is the son of the Fuller mentioned in a previous chapter, and who was murdered because he was suspected of being connected with the underground railroad, and also of aiding my father, who had already partially paid for his freedom, trying to get away.)
After reading the note Uncle Tom told me to drive back and go around by the Salisbury road. This took me nearly two miles out of the way, but in the middle of this road was a large mud puddle. He told me to
drive in there, very fast, then get out and wade in the water, and get the envelope wet and muddy. He showed me how to smear It over with my hands so mistress would not detect that it had been opened. He also showed me how to make saliva or crocodile tears. He said mistress would be on the porch watching for me, and that I should pretend to cry, at the same time get the envelope from my pocket, handing it to her with the left hand. She would take it with her right hand, tear it open and drop the envelope on the ground. As soon as she was gone I was to pick it up and destroy it. Mr. Fuller was in the house, having come to see master on business, so when mistress heard the carriage coming she came to the big gate to meet it, thinking master was returning, and left Mr. Fuller in the house. When I saw her coming I made some crocodile tears by wetting my fingers with saliva. As soon as she saw that master was not with me, she came rushing to the buggy and found me shedding tears as fast as I could. In a very tender tone, with her hand upon my head, she asked me what was the matter. At this I broke down completely and cried aloud, at the same time feeling in my pocket for the envelope, and telling my sad story, between sobs, of how I had dropped it in the mud hole. She eagerly grasped it and tore it open, not noticing that it had ever been opened before, and patting me on the head, she said, "hush, mistress can read it." That instantly healed my pretended broken heart and dried up my manufactured tears.
She started for the house, forgetting she had not
cautioned me, so she came back and told me "that Mr. Fuller was in the house, and for me not to mention anything to him or any one on the place, concerning the cannon firing." She then wrote a note and gave it to me to take to Mr. Sawyer. She had dropped the envelope and I was glad when she was out of sight. Picking up the envelope I put it in my mouth, chewed it up, removed a harness peg, put the pulp in the hole, and replaced the peg. If the old barn is still standing the envelope is there yet. I took the note to Mr. Sawyer and in a short time he was at the house in close consultation with her. Then he went after his son Martin, and they both went over to five mile farm, where Uncle Tom was overseer. She wrote another note to Mr. Bailey, a poor white man living about a mile away, and he came at once and took charge of our farm. He was once overseer on our place , but was so cruel that massa discharged him. So now he served as an extra two or three days at a time for the different overseers in the community, for which he received seventy-five cents per day, and what he could get the slaves to steal for him, for notwithstanding their inhumanity to the slaves, they kept up a constant trade with them. They stole their master's corn, wheat, chickens, hogs, etc., and carried them to the overseer, for which he would give them a little flour, and occasionally a dime or two, and very often when he was about to whip them he would let them off by their promising to bring him some meat or chickens. Master came home that night, and after supper five or six of the leading men from Wilmington came. After
I brought in the demijohn, glasses and water, master told me that I could go to bed, because he would want me to go away with him early the next day. But instead of going to bed I pulled off my shoes, tip-toed down stairs and peeped through the keyhole, and not making an exception to the rule, my ear did its share of listening. They got into a hot discussion, and I heard one of them say, "if the Yankees whipped, every negro would be free." I became satisfied that the negro was the bone of contention, and that the light of liberty was probably about to dawn, so I went to bed.
On the morning of April 15th, 1861, I left home with my master to go to the war and whip the Yankees in three days; I carried a club for the first three days to knock off Yankees' horns with, for my master told me that they had horns. We were gone more than three months; we didn't whip them, but were gaining a victory in every battle that was fought, and this was encouraging to the rebels. You could hear the southern ladies singing "Old Lincoln and his hireling troops would never whip the South." We came home on a week's furlough, then returned to be gone six months, but before the expiration of the six months, my master was killed by a shell bursting at Greenville, Tennessee, near the place where John Morgan was killed.
At first the northern people were chagrined and disheartened. Then came a renewed determination. They saw the real character of the war, and no longer dreamed that the south could be subdued by a mere display of military force. They were to fight a brave people - Americans - who were to be conquered only by a desperate struggle. During the first year of the war the Confederates had captured the large arsenals at Harper's Ferry, near Norfolk. They had been successful in the two great battles of the year - Bull Run and Wilson's Creek; also in the minor engagements at Big Bethel, Carthage, Lexington, Belmont, and Ball's Bluff. The Federals had saved Fort Pickens and Fort Monroe, and captured the forts at Hatteras Inlet and Port Royal. They had gained the victories of Phillippi, Rich Mountain, Boonville, Carricks' Ford, Cheat Mountain, Carnifex Ferry and Danville. They had saved for the union, Missouri, Maryland, and West Virginia. Principally, however, they had thrown the whole south into a state of siege - the armies on the north and the west by land, and the navy in the east by sea, maintaining a vigilant blockade.
After the death of my master I remained as cook for the company until November, 1863, when at Blue Springs, Tennessee, Generals Thomas and Burnside
routed Hood and Forrest, after a short contest; and in the retreat, I, with many others, was captured. I was with the cooks' brigade. There were about fifty of us, and each one was riding one of those long eared fellows, that lean against the fence and say, "I have no one to love me."
In the retreat we had quite a deep ditch, or gully, to cross. My animal was heavily loaded with camp kettles, tin pans and kitchen utensils in general. When the cavalry got to this ditch they commanded their horses to mount, and the horses leaped over, but I suspect in the excitement I forgot to give the necessary commands, for my long eared friend's fore feet reached the other shore safely, but his hind feet fell short of the mark, and down in the ditch we went; such a scramble you never saw. But I found that there were many rebel soldiers in there, who were tired of the Yankee lead and wanted to be captured. I was scrambling to get out, but they told me to lie still, and in a few moments Yankee soldiers - both cavalry and infantry, seemed to have popped up out of the earth; while some pursued the fleeing rebels, others took us to the general's headquarters. The rebels were sent to the northern prisons, and the cooks and colored servants that had been captured, were next brought before General Thomas and disposed of. I was the last man in the line, and when I came before the general, his first words to me were, "you're a fine looking fellow. Here we are fighting to free you and you are here dressed up in a suit of rebel uniform." He then called his cook - a quaint looking, cross-eyed old man,
who like myself, was "hewn out of a slab of ebony." He said, "Nathan, what shall we do with this boy?" "Hang him to the highest tree we can find," said Nathan. "Well, bring me the best rope you can find." Nathan obeyed. He came with a rope as large around as his wrist, and about twenty feet long. The general asked him if he thought that would hold me; he answered in the affirmative, and General Thomas told him to throw it over the limb of a tall oak which stood near by. But an officer by the name of Lane rode up and said: "General, maybe this boy will take the oath of allegiance." I would have taken most anything about this time. Then the general inquired of me if I would take the oath. I told him I would. By this time some one said, "hold up your right hand." Another said, "hold up your left hand," another said, "your right foot," and another said, "your left foot." I obeyed orders as fast as they were given until it came to the left foot. I had up all I could possibly get up. After having all the fun they wanted with me, the general told Nathan to take me back and wash and clean me up. Uncle Nathan took me to his tent, where he had a kettle of boiling water. It looked as if he were going to scald a hog; then began the washing process. After the old man had rubbed and washed me until my flesh burned, and I had put on a castaway suit of General Thomas', I went to headquarters. After standing before the large mirror in the general's tent. I thought I was the richest, freest man in America. They had carried the joke to such an extent - for I really thought they were going
to hang me - that I was sick. They administered some medicine to me and I lay down across the general's bed, General Thomas himself having told me to. When I awoke about 3 p. m. I was between the two generals, Burnside and Thomas. When I moved towards one he would crowd against me, and if I moved towards the other he would crowd in, until I was squeezed as tightly as possible between the two. They were both awake, and I could feel their sides heaving until they could not restrain their laughter any longer, then General Thomas said, "lie still boy, this white won't rub off." This was my first day of freedom.
General Thomas questioned me concerning my parents, and on learning that my mother was in Greenville, Tennesse, he said; "you will see her within three days if the rebels don't whip us." Accordingly we left Blue Springs that day enroute to Madison Court House, Virginia. which brought us through Greenville where mother was. It was hard to prevent me from being the advance guard. For two days they were trying to hold me back, until we finally reached Greenville, and I saw the house in which mother lived. Seeing that no rebels were near, the officers allowed me to advance. Before I reached the house I saw mother and my Jewish mistress, Mrs. Hadley, standing on the porch. Everybody seemed very much excited, and the rebel army was retreating.
Having changed my uniform from the rebel gray to the Yankee blue, my mother did not recognize me until I was at the gate; then she came running and shouting "this is William." I was saying in one
breath - not waiting for one question to be answered before I asked another, "how are you?" I am free, are you? Get ready to go to the Yankees; has master the same black horse and buggy?" She told me he had. I told her to go pack up while I hitched the horse to the buggy. When I returned to the house the soldiers had surrounded it and asked me where my mother was. I ran up stairs. tried to open mother's door, when she informed me that Massa Jake had locked her in. The soldiers were hurrying me to get my mother and come on I told them Massa had locked her in, and one of them gave me an ax and told me to break the door open. I told mother to stand back from the door. At the same time Massa Jake came in with a shot gun in his hand, but before he could raise it dozens of muskets were aimed at him. By this time I had the door open, and there stood mother with a rope around the bureau, and every loose article she could get hold of was wrapped in her straw tick, all tied up ready for moving. She was expecting to move the whole cargo in a buggy.
I had her unpack as quickly as possible and gather up her clothes and little keepsakes, so we could be out of the yard as soon as possible. I shall never forget the courtesy shown mother by two or three soldiers, in helping her in the buggy. Being all ready, and our buggy placed in line with the other contrabands - for there were between one hundred anti fifty and two hundred wagons, mule carts, pack horses, mules and even milch cows, we started on our journey.
Most of the southern men had gone to war, and
those who were too old to go had taken the women and gone to the cities, leaving the farms and country homes virtually in charge of the colored people. I had an uncle who was left in charge of a farm three miles from town. We passed by his place on our way to Virginia, and when we came in sight of the farm we could see colored people by the hundreds, who had gathered from other farms. The news spread like wild fire all over the country that the Yankees had come.
The "great house" was kept furnished the year round and left in the colored overseer's charge, because the family would come back and forth, sometimes staying weeks at a time. The veranda was filled with men, women and children, singing, shouting and praising God in the highest. I hastened into the yard and was soon the center of attraction. Uncle Isaac was soon by my side, picking me up and carrying me around, shouting at the top of his voice, while I was struggling to get down, and trying to drown his voice so I could tell him that he was free, and to pack up at once and go with us.
I was inviting him to liberty, yet I had not a shelter in all the world to put my head save the canopy of Heaven. But I had heard of a country where all men were free, and like Bunyan's Pilgrim I had started to make it my home.
I finally succeeded in loosing myself from his strong embrace, and then I made a short speech to all, telling them to hitch their ox and mule carts, and load up their things and go to the Yankees. There was considerable
fear about their doing as I said, until some of the soldiers appeared, and helped to dispel this fear by confirming what I had said. It was not long until the yard was fairly lined with wagons, carts and every conceivable beast of burden. They began to tear down their old bedsteads, built against the walls of their cabins, and gather up their rude furniture, when the Yankees asked what was in the "great house." On learning that it was furnished they demanded that it be opened, and that the people take everything they wanted and load their wagons. My uncle had the key but refused to open the door, saying "that belongs to old Master." Fifteen or twenty soldiers then seized a huge log of wood and broke the door down.
'Twas but a few minutes until the great place was gutted. The piano was the only piece of furniture remaining, and some women wanted to take that for their girls when they became educated. Now the wagons were loaded to their utmost capacity. I can't afford to spoil a good joke because of race, color or nationality. Then the children were put on, and it seems to me now that the mothers must have taken some kind of paste and put on the backs of the children, so as to stick them up against the furniture. They were so thick around the wagons it seemed there was not a spot left where there was not a baby. They were of all sizes and colors; they were black, dark brown, pumpkin colored, yellow and half white. And they were all crying with a different voice, giving different tunes to the song they were singing. It was
certainly a menagerie when the procession left the farm. Some of the babies were crying alto, some soprano, some bass, but most of them baritone - because it was bare of all music.
Of course all of our masters were honorable, and these children were all called by their master's name - but they didn't call them papa all the time. Many of their mothers were as honorable as a woman could be under the circumstances, but many times in order to save their backs from being lacerated they obeyed the command of their master, and their commands were not always honorable.
The soldiers now moved forward toward Knoxville, Tennessee. We had four or five hundred men, women and children in this great march from a land of servitude to a land of liberty. Sometimes like Pharaoh of old, the old masters would pursue their slaves, and even come into the camp but the slaves' fears would soon be dispelled by the stern command of some Yankee soldier or officer, who would order the rebs to leave the camp. Many times they subjected them to some humiliating treatment - such as riding the rail horse, or carrying a barrel up the hill and rolling it down again, and they would continue this process for hours. After skirmishing for a week or ten days we arrived at Knoxville, Tennessee, where we sold the horses, mules, oxen, buggies and wagons to General Thomas. I bought an old log cabin on the old battle field for my mother. I was to give seventeen dollars for this property. I could count from one to fifty, but I could not tell the denominations; I didn't know a
ten dollar bill from a one; so I counted out seventeen bills and paid for the place. Later I learned that I had paid some forty or fifty dollars for it.
About this time, in 1863, Frederick Douglas went to Washington to see President Lincoln, telling him "that our people were digging breast works, exposed to the shot and shell, and why not give them guns and let them have a hand in freeing themselves and saving the union." Lincoln's reply was that the feeling at the north was running so high he didn't know what the result would be, for no measure of the war was more bitterly opposed than the project of arming slaves. It was denounced at the north, and the confederate congress passed a law which threatened with death any white officer captured while in command of negro troops, leaving the men to be dealt with according to the laws of the state in which they were taken. Douglas said he returned home, but slept little that night, for he continually called on God to in some way bring peace out of the confusion, and open the way for colored men to get on the field of battle as enlisted soldiers. The next morning by nine o'clock Douglas said he was at the capitol and closeted with the president. To his surprise Lincoln told him that Grant had sent for a division of colored soldiers. Lincoln commissioned Douglas as recruiting officer, and sent him to Boston Massachusetts, where he mustered in the 54th and 55th colored regiments. These were the first colored regiments organized in the free states.
Col. Shaw led the 54th regiment in its first battle at Fort Wagner. After keeping us in reserve for three
hours while the union soldiers were falling like Wheat before the sharpened sickle, Col. Shaw asked to lead the black phalanx into the battle, notwithstanding he knew it meant certain death to him if he was captured, the confederates having said they would not take any union soldier prisoner who was in command of colored troops, for they did not recognize the colored men as citizens or soldiers, therefore would not consider them or their leaders as prisoners of war. Col. Shaw sent his orderly back to the wagon train. He returned in a few moments and handed the Colonel a bundle, which contained a regimental silk flag with the inscription, "To the 54th Colored Regiment, Robert G. Shaw, Colonel. Presented by the White Ladies of Boston, Massachusetts." Our regiment went wild at the sight of the flag. They carried Col. Shaw up and down the line on their shoulders, cheering like mad. As he handed the flag to Carney, the flag bearer, the Colonel said, "Carney, will you return this flag to us in honor?" His answer was, "Colonel, I will do so or report to God the reason I do not." The roll was called and twelve hundred men and officers answered to their names. The battle was on. Our gallant Colonel's side was torn by a shell a few moments after. His dying words were, "boys, don't let the flag go down." His body never touched the ground, being borne to the rear by his colored troops, one of whom was instantly killed. His place was immediately filled by another. Carney's right arm was shot off during the battle. As he fell, holding the flag with his left hand and in his teeth, he shouted, "boys, don't let the flag go down."
When the roll was called after the battle seventy-seven had answered to their last roll call, having fallen defending the flag and fighting for their liberty. Colonel Shaw was buried with his many black soldiers who lost their lives in this fierce battle.
At one time, in order to be in season for an assault, these regiments marched two days through heavy sands and drenching storms. After only five minutes rest, we took our place at the front of the attacking column. The men fought with unflinching gallantry, and planted their flags. So willing were the negroes to enlist, and so faithful did they prove themselves in service, that in December, 1863, over fifty thousand had been enrolled, and before the close of the war that number was quadrupled.
I recognized then that I was to take part in one of the greatest wars of modern times. The war of the rebellion was now on, when the numbers engaged in it, and the extent of territory affected are considered. It was primarily a war based on sentiment. The long, but peaceful and prayerful contest of the abolitionist against the slave power, and the earnest and faithful prayer of the slave himself, all crowded the throne of a just God, and had aroused the whole country, so that everywhere, in every state in the union, there was a sharp division of opinion among the people. It is true always, however, that God makes the wrath of man to serve him, and out of the wear of the rebellion the slave fought his way to freedom. What a glorious record the Afro-American made in that war! It is one of the brightest pages in all history. In the early
stages of the war he was not even allowed to drive the teams, to dig trenches or to throw up breastworks for the union army. Tile soldiers of the north declared that this was a white man's war, and that sentiment had made it very difficult for the government at Washington to call for colored troops, but before the close of the war he was a regularly enlisted soldier in all the departments, to the number of 200,000, and had fought with such valor, such heroism, from Fort Wagner to Fort Fisher, from New Market Heights to Petersburg, that when the victorious union army at last marched into Richmond, the fallen and deserted capitol of the lost cause, he was accorded the first place of honor at the head of the column! Thirty six years afterwards Colonel Theodore Roosevelt, of the rough riders, commented on the bravery of the black soldiers after the brilliant charge of a successful capture of San Juan Hill. Thirty six years after Colonel Robert Gould Shaw was buried with his negroes, in the sands of Morris Island, the world has looked with enthusiasm upon the heroic deeds and gallantry of the negro soldier, and today he is filling his station from West Point, the military center of the world, to the navy that plows the distant seas and watches the gate way to this nation. This fact is demonstrated when you recall to memory the 25th of January, 1898, when the battleship Maine steamed into the harbor of Havana. She went there on an errand of peace, the representative of a friendly power. On the 15th of February the Maine was blown to atoms by a floating mine, together with two hundred sixty-six American sailors, of whom more than thirty were negroes.
In 1864, near Blue Springs, Tennessee, three union soldiers became separated from their army, and when passing through a small oak grove one of them got into the quicksand. The others, supposing their companion was closely following them, pursued their course.
This poor hero was left behind, struggling for his life in the quicksand, for three days and nights, buoying himself up from sinking, with the aid of such sticks and brush as he could reach. This location was but a short distance from a large southern mansion. The men had all gone to war and there were left but a few old colored mothers to protect the old mistress.
Aunt Nancy Jordan dreamed one night, or saw a vision, as she termed it, that she saw a man in trouble near the springs, and that she heard a voice saying: "Nancy, go to the east spring." She claimed to have heard that call three different times that night in her dreams, and early the next morning she took her pail and went to the spring. When near the place, she heard a human voice pleading for help. She then realized her dream or presentiment, and on looking saw union soldier buried to his armpits in the quicksand. She knew just what it meant, and started toward him. He murmured for her not to come too close. Her reply was "God bless you chile, I knows
all about dis place." She felt her way as close to him as possible, or until she felt the quicksand giving way under her, then she gathered brush and bridged her way over to him, or near enough to reach him with a long handled gourd. She then went to the spring, which was not over twenty feet away, and secured water for him, as his tongue was so badly swollen that he could scarcely speak. She held the gourd to his lips, slaked his thirst, and then began the work of rescue, piling brush around him. She then got hold of his arms and assisted him out so that he could sit upon the brush.
That spring was never used by the people from the mansion on account of the quicksand, and alkali in the water. Nancy returned to the house with her pail of water, then hurried back with food in the pail upon her head. In this way she fed him for three weeks, at the end of which time one morning she heard the tramp, tramp of a mighty army. Bands were playing and bugles sounding. Then she saw old Missie scampering for the cellar, for, said she: "Nancy, they are Lincoln's hirelings, for they are all dressed in blue." Aunt Nancy hurried to the spring and told the soldier that the Yankees were coming. He at once came from his hiding place. When he reached the yard of that mansion he found it swarming with union soldiers. He said to Aunt Nancy, "I can't leave you here, for you must go with us." She replied: "I promised old master not to leave old missie till he comes back from de wah." But he assured her that it meant her freedom, and asked if she had not prayed to
be free? She replied: "Yas sah," and that if it meant her freedom she would bid old missie good bye.
There was a pathetic scene at this parting. Old mistress ventured to the porch and took her last long look at her old ex-slave, as the Yankee soldier was helping her into the wagon.
Aunt Nancy became cook in the camp for the officers, and this soldier, whom she had rescued, looked after her as though she were his mother. He was an Englishman, and had come to this country about the time of the beginning of the war. He naturalized and enlisted. When he was discharged he took Aunt Nancy to England with him and presented her to his mother as the preserver of his life. She had been in London two years or more when I arrived there, and was among the most honored women of the city.
She came back to America on the same steamer that I came on. She was certainly looked upon as a sanctified christian woman.
The soldier who took her over was bringing her back. He would have her dress in the same costume she wore when she rescued him from the quicksands, and thus gave an exhibition every few days. She was not now the same illiterate Aunt Nancy that she was three years ago for contact with educated and refined people had polished her up wonderfully.
1 In the last civil war,
The white folks they began it.
But before it could close,
The negro had to be in it.
2 At the battle of San Juan hill,
The rough riders they began it;
But before victory could be won
The negro had to be in it.
3 The negro shot the Spaniard from the trees,
And never did regret it,
The rouge riders would have been dead today,
Had the negro not been in it.
4 To Buffalo McKinley went,
To welcome people in it,
The prayer was played, the speeches made,
The negro he was in it.
5 September sixth, in Music Hall,
With thousands, thousands in it,
McKinley fell from the assassin's hand -
And the negro, he got in it.
6 He knocked the murderer to the floor,
He struck his nose, the blood did flow;
He held him fast, all near by saw it,
When for the right the negro is in it.
7 J. R. Parke is his name,
He from the state of Georgia came;
He worked in Buffalo for his bread,
And there he saw McKinley dead.
8 They bought his clothes for souvenirs,
And may they ever tell it -
That when the president was shot,
A brave negro was in it.
9 McKinley now in heaven rests;
Where he will ne'er regret it;
And well he knows, that in all his joys,
There was a negro in it.
10 White man, stop lynching and burning
This black race, trying to thin it -
For if you go to heaven or hell,
You will find some negro in it.
11 You may try to shut the negro out
The courts, they began it,
But when we meet at the judgment bar
God will tell you the negro is in it.
12 Pay them to swear a lie in court,
Both whites and blacks will do it;
Truth will shine, to the end of time,
And you will find a negro in it.
13 If there's a position to be filled,
In congress or in senate,
We people of this nation pray
This negro may get in it.
MRS. LENA MASON.
I enlisted in the 54th Massachusetts, where I remained nine months; was transferred to the 28th Indiana, on account of having an uncle in that regiment. I remained in the army from July, 1863, until December, 1865. Was in the following regular battles: Battle of the Wilderness, Kenesaw Mountain, Chancellorsville, Virginia, Culpepper, Virginia, Antietam, Maryland, Blue Springs, Missionary Ridge, Nashville, and Greenville, Tennessee and many other skirmishes.
I was mustered out on December 29, 1865, with no home to go to, no starting point or object in life. The rebels had raided Knoxville Tennessee, and mother, with all the colored people, had left there, and I could gain no knowledge concerning her whereabouts. I saw my mother in 1863, when I left her in the little log cabin in Knoxville, and I never saw her again for fifteen years.. Knowing that my mother was a christian woman, and would be identified with some church I wrote to all the churches in Huntsville, and finally received an answer, stating that a
woman answering that description had lived there, but not of that name - for I inquired for Rosy Hadley, the name of her last master.
I then went to Huntsville, and after spending a month of constant research and inquiry I had to give it up as futile. I returned to Nashville, but did not give up the search through the medium of letters. Finally I received a letter from Chattanooga. I went there and spent more than two months, but to no avail. After this I heard nothing from her, or concerning her, for over six years.. He went to an underground railroad station twelve miles from Wilmington. Here he was put in a box, this box was enclosed in another box, and the second box in a third box, and sent by express to New York, where he was released from his somewhat cramped quarters in Rev. Henry Ward Beecher's parlor. To give him air, holes were bored in each box, care being taken that they were not opposite each other. From New York he went to Toronto, Canada, was educated by the Presbyterian church, serving many years as a pastor. He died in 1890. About three hours before his death he sat propped up in bed, and preached a sermon, using as his text "Blessed is the man who dyeth in the Lord. He shall rest from his labors and his works do follow
him." After his remarkable escape he always went by the name of "Box Brown.""
That memorable morning, as I left the city of Nashville, with my fireman's uniform on, and two hundred dollars in my pockets, my heart was buoyant with expectation, for it was no more hope, but a grand reality, that I would see the faces of the dearest earthly friends I had - a mother and two sisters. The arrangements for the meeting had been made unbeknown to mother. At train time my sisters were on the alert for me, and as I neared the house they called mother's attention to some one coming. Mother came to the door, walking with a cane; she said, "that walks something like my William." But the sight of mother so elated me that I bent my steps quick and fast toward the house. When I was close enough for her to recognize my face, she uttered the words before stated.
I am lost for language to describe the scene which followed. The only thing which cast a shadow over
the pleasure of our meeting was when mother asked, "if we had heard anything from father?" The house of joy was turned into lamentation, but after a while quiet was restored. We never saw or heard from father after he was sold. We learned that another brother, named Andrew, was about eight miles from Knoxville. In a few days he joined us and we spent a glorious time together. There were now mother and six children together - two sisters and four brothers.
I returned to Nashville - which I considered home - after several weeks' visit with mother. I re-entered on my duties as fireman - for I was a member of the City Fire Department, and had been engaged as hosecart driver for eight months. Shortly after my return we were called out to a large fire. While fighting the fire the captain called to "Jim Howard." After calling several times and no one seemingly hearing him, he called "Jim Cowens," and that attracted my attention. I looked to see who would answer, and seeing a man on top of the house answering, I immediately climbed on the building.
I inquired of Jim "where he came from," and many similar questions, and it was but a few minutes until we recognized each other as brothers. Now you can better imagine what followed than I can express it. It came to the ears of the City Council of the City of Nashville, "that two brothers who had served eight months in No. 2 Hose Company, had just recognized each other as brothers - having been separated for sixteen years." In honor of our meeting they gave us a public reception.
One extreme always follows another, for in three weeks from the time of our recognition, my brother was thrown seventy-two feet from the hook and ladder
against the stone custom house, and every bone in his body was broken; he died instantly.
I served seventeen months in the fire department, and resigned to accept a situation as singer and banjo player in a troupe gotten up by S. C. Wallace. The troupe was known as the "Tennessee Singers" (not the original Tennessee Jubilee Singers, yet we attracted the attention of the public at large to the extent that we were constantly in demand. ) We made a tour from Nashville, Tennessee, to Indianapolis, Indiana, thence to Terre Haute, Indiana, from there to Chicago, Springfield. Bloomington, Illinois, LaPorte, Indiana, Detroit, Michigan, and Windsor, Canada. On our return trip we sang in the following cities in Michigan: Grand Rapids, Battle Creek, Kalamazoo and Niles, then back through Indiana and Kentucky to Nashville, Tennessee. We sang nothing but the southern melodies - songs composed by our fathers and mothers in the days of slavery. We disbanded in November, 1868.
In January, 1869, I hired to what was known as the Hanlon's Wizard Oil Company, with seven others, at twelve dollars per month and board. The contract was for one year. If there was any one thing I was accomplished in it was picking the banjo and singing; and I soon became the center of attraction along these lines. We gave street concerts for advertising the oil. We made a tour of the leading cities of Indiana, Illinois and Michigan, thence to New York City, where we took passage, May 21, 1869, on the steamer "City of New York," for London, England.
Everyone treated me so different than I was used to
during the time of slavery, that I forgot, to some extent, the hardships through which I had passed, and more than once stopped and inquired of myself "is this heaven, and am I in it?"
The passage over was a very pleasant one, and we arrived in London the 27th day of June, 1869. We neared London - the metropolis of the world. I saw hundreds of vessels, the white winged messengers of commerce , coming from all directions, loaded for London harbor.
The news had been cabled before us that we would arrive June 27th and hundreds of the populace were at the harbor. Their curiosity had been aroused to the highest tension. We repaired to Hotel de France, where we were the center of attraction; hundreds followed the carriages in which we rode to the hotel, and ran over each other in order to get a look at the ladies and gentlemen from America. After supper we went to St. Paul's Cathedral - which had a seating capacity of over two thousand. Here we gave our first concert. The people were wild with enthusiasm, and fairly rained shillings, three cent pieces and bouquets to us on the stage.
At the close of this first concert, a gentleman by the name of William S. Beckenworth, known as Lord Beckenworth, with one son and two daughters, made their way to the stage. After introducing themselves they requested me to go home with them that night, which I could not do without the consent of the manager, Mr. Howard. They at once went to him, and he promised them that I could go the next night,
After the sale of medicine the next night I was escorted to the cab by this family, and carried to their home as a guest; and in one single bound I leaped from "Bill Cowens to Lord Cowens, or the Gentleman from America."
Now the great panorama of my life, as a free man, began. My associations were entirely different to those I had been used to - even in my master's home. As I recall that night it becomes a night of wonder to me. As I entered that palace, on St. Mark's avenue, as a guest, they seated me in the center of their spacious parlor, and served me with refreshments. One of the daughters placed a napkin across my chest and gave me a server, upon which were several varieties of very fine fruit. Eighteen or twenty of their friends were present, and all except myself seemed to enjoy the luxuries to the highest extent. This being my first time to be served on social equality with white people, of course I was very much embarrased. I put some of the most delicate fruit in my mouth, but it seemed almost impossible for me to masticate it, for the longer I chewed it the larger it seemed to grow, until I could not swallow. Of course I told them that I was not hungry and did not care for the refreshments, but way down in my heart I was wishing that I had the server, with the refreshments upon it, behind the house - in a few minutes they would have known that I had been there. After a time, pitying my embarrasment, the tray was removed, and I was asked to tell them something of myself and family.
I entertained them for an hour and a half or two
hours, and the party retired for the night: but before leaving each one gave me a shilling, and left with the understanding that I was to tell them more about my people the next night. After the father had family prayer they showed me the room I was to occupy and bade me good-night.
After locking the door, and carefully examining the windows with a scrutinizing eye, I searched every crack and crevice in the room, Then I got under the bed and felt the springs. I had heard my master, years before, tell about trap doors under the beds in New Orleans, and that people would get into bed only to find themselves in some dark alley. They had passed through a trap floor and down a slide. Of course, in these cases, the motive was robbery. I don't know why I was fearful, since I had no money save what the people had given me. But the great, unsolvable mystery surrounding me was, why I, an ex-slave, should be paid such high respect among strangers.
There was a night shirt for me to sleep in, also a breakfast gown of heavy velvet. I examined both these articles of comfort laid them back where I found them, took both the sheets off the bed and folded them up, laid them on a chair and climbed in bed. I began to sink so fast in the middle of the big feather bed - had anyone been on the outside they could have heard me gasping and catching my breath - for with all my careful searching for the trap door I thought I was gone, but I finally landed on my pillow of repose.
The second night was almost a repetition of the first. I was like the country lad who went to the city to visit a lady friend. He used a little of the weed. Not being accustomed to use a cuspidor he spat over in a corner. The lady noticing it, pushed the cuspidor to one side of him. He shoved it away. She tried putting it in front of him. Finally, in desperation, he blurted out, "if you don't take that gol darned thing away I'll spit in it." I looked at the night shirt and said to myself, "if that is here another night, I will put it on," also the breakfast robe, I thought the same thing concerning it. So the third night, finding the night shirt still there, I put it on; the next morning on going down to breakfast I put on the breakfast robe. I saw the girls cast glances at each other and wink, as much as to say "he's learning."
I was in England eleven months and a half, and during that time I slept only three nights out of Lord Beckenworth's house. We went to the different hamlets, as far as forty miles from London, but always returned there at night. The roads in London were so carefully kept that you could drive forty miles there while driving half that distance in America. But the first five months of our time were spent principally in the different cathedrals and opera houses in London. During the first three or four weeks of that time there were from twenty to twenty-five guests at Lord Beckenworth's house every night to hear me talk about my slave life. But after that his two daughters conceived, and put into execution, the grandest thought that could have entered their minds. That was, to try to
instill in me the idea of education. They bought books and started on their laborious work, excusing the visitors that came each night, and inviting them to come only on Friday nights, and this they did in large numbers. At first the two sisters were both teachers, one sitting in class with me while the other taught, and vice versa. Many nights we sat up from 10 to 12 o'clock - for I was very anxious to learn. After getting rudiments in my mind I learned with surprising quickness, and knew my letters as if by magic. I could have worn out both of these girls physically, so they decided to take turn about, one each night. And for ten consecutive months I attended school in this home, these two angels of mercy being my teachers. They were faithful, tireless and unfeigned in their efforts to give me some educational light. When I got so I could spell words of two syllables I was like the old fellow when he had learned his alphabet. He said "he had too much edification to stay here or any whar else."
Once a week the visitors would attend in large numbers to see how much I had advanced, and I delighted very much in reciting before them. They were very much amused when I came to spell certain words, especially "baker." I spelled it in that dialectical way, pronouncing each syllable in such a way that it would cause a burst of laughter each time. As I have said before, I learned very rapidly, had an uncommon verbal memory, and in eight months' time was able to read plain reading and could write fairly well. I recall the first letter I wrote. It was to Ulysses S. Grant, at
that time president of the United States. I wanted to write to the greatest man in the world, and I thought after Lincoln Grant was next. I reminded him of an incident that occurred during the battle of Kenesaw Mountain, in 1864. He and his staff rode up, a tree limb knocked his hat off, and I thoughtlessly stepped out of my ranks, picked up the hat and handed it to the general. I received a very severe reprimand from my captain, but General Grant called him and in a few words, unheard by me, he satisfied the captain. Then he said to me, "boy, if we both live to get out of the war, let me know where you are and I'll remember you for this favor."
So I wrote to President Grant, informing him that I was alive, and had risen from the ranks of a private soldier in the union army to a Lord, (in title but not in wealth) in England. Miss Emeline - the older daughter of Lord Beckenworth, wrote also, as I dictated and wrote - for I spoke audibly every word I wrote. Of course, when I had finished my letter it looked as if blueing had been poured into a plate and a chicken had walked into it, then over the paper. All the lawyers in the United States could not have read it. But Miss Emeline's letter was enclosed with mine. This was the first letter I ever wrote in my life, and a day or two after I mailed it I began to trouble the postmaster. I went twice a day, expecting an answer from my letter, not considering it had to cross the sea. I was like two negro men, one a runaway from the south, who had crossed the line and gotten safely into the north; the other was a barrister in the north. The
runaway negro inquired of the lawyer the way into Canada. The latter scratched his cranium for a moment, cleared his throat, pulled off his gloves, looked over his spectacles and said, "well, sa-ar, if you go by de steamboat and it blowed down whar is you? If you go on the steam kears and dey blowed up, dar you is; but if you go on the junegraph (meaning telegraph) you are dar now."
I wrote my letter to America and thought by the day it was "dar now." But in about thirty days the post master was made glad, and I made to rejoice. It certainly must have been a source of joy to him to be honored with the privilege of handing me the first letter I ever received for myself in my life; but he must have been gladdened to be relieved of a troublesome customer. The president paid me a very high compliment for the exalted station I had reached in so short a time, and invited me to visit the White House on my return to America. He advised me to remain in England until I was thoroughly polished at the hands of this noble family, so that I might return a useful man to my race and the nation. He wrote Miss Emeline a fine letter, commending me as a soldier, and thanking her for the interest she and her sister had taken in the new citizen of America, hewn out of a slab of ebony.
Eleven months spent almost entirely away from my people, save a few hours at night, and constant association with the Caucasian race, wrought quite a wonderful change in myself and habits. As association breeds assimilation, I had gotten almost entirely rid of
that southern dialect. My aspirations began to mount above my environments and from that time I began to seek higher things in life. The spirit of manhood which lay slumbering in my breast began to awaken.
This ambition to make something of myself was further strengthened by an incident which occured at this time. Frederick Douglas, marshall of the District of Columbia, was paying London a visit. Queen Victoria, in order to give the people an opportunity of seeing this great man, took him in the royal carriage through the principal streets of the city. The carriage was drawn by twelve horses, and each horse was led by a man in uniform. All London turned out to do honor to America's famous colored orator. The sight of Mr. Douglas as he stood up in the carriage, hat in hand, his silvery hair falling to his shoulders, bowing right and left to the crowds of people who were shouting themselves hoarse in their enthusiasm, fired me with the desire to become a public speaker.
Soon I began to get ready to embark for America again. I had made many friends during my stay in England, who proved to be friends indeed, for the night before my departure they gave me a grand reception, two hundred and twenty dollars and enough clothing to last me a year. This was to enable me to attend school, and every year for four years, they sent me fifty dollars. It was as sad to me parting from these English friends as it ever was to part with my brothers and sisters. When I got in the carriage the next day dozens of friends stood around bidding me adieu, and God's blessings. But thank God, I am not
returning the same "William Cowens," in appearance or knowledge, as when I left; for new thoughts and new ideas, that had lain slumbering under the iron heel of oppression for twenty-one years, groaning for light and liberty, are now awakened, and thank God, the light of a new day is dawning upon me.
On board the vessel, instead of entertaining the guests with banjo picking and southern songs, I could talk of things of a higher life, and the passengers soon became interested in me. So much so that for thirty nine days a gentleman, by the name of Joseph P. Ray, and his wife, became my tutors; taking up my lessons where I had left off in England, hearing my last lesson the day we landed in New York.
I wandered around this large city for two months trying to find a permanent location, but everything seemed either to high or too fast for me, so I decided to go back to Nashville, Tennessee. I soon put my decision into execution and arrived in Nashville in June. The Methodist Episcopal established a school known as the Freedman's Bureau, from which sprang the great Central Tennessee College. At this time it was only an obscure log hut; today, it is the Atheneum of Education. I entered school here, and continued three years, until my money was exhausted. I then went to work half the day and attended school the other half, and continued in school in this manner for one term. Many times I had nothing in my dinner pail but corn bread and stewed apples. Often I was ashamed for others to see how I was faring, and went off by myself to eat my lunch. My teacher, noticing
that I had about the same thing each day, asked me if I never ate anything else but corn bread and dried apples. I felt very much humiliated to tell her that that was all I was able to have. She encouraged me very much by telling me of others that had become great men in this country, who had had even less opportunities than I, yet they pushed their way to the topmost round of the ladder of fame. She also told me that a path of great success was before me, if I only continued as I had started. After that day she never failed to divide her dinner with me. I learned very fast under her, but finally had to quit school entirely and go to work. I worked one year - taking care of three different persons' horses, and making fires in the winter. I saved my money, and when school opened the next year I started again. After that term I went to night school.
In 1874 I entered the freshman class in college: I met with another embarrasment here, for every one in the class was ahead of me. As I did not complete the high school course it made it more difficult for me in college. But I had that spirit of determination, and studied with a will, and by the close of the term I had caught up with all the class but three; had made many friends, and was considered by all far from being the dullest boy in the class.
About this time I became very much interested in politics, and the issue of the day was so common that it did not require a man of great ability to become a stump speaker. All I had to do was to remind my people of the fact that the Yankees freed them, and that these Yankees were the present republican party; frequent mentioning of the name of Abraham Lincoln would stir all the patriotism there was in them. I soon became very popular among my race, so much so that I was consulted on every point of the least importance. I was an ardent lover of books, and read quite extensively. I would read many nights all night, and my memory served me well. It was the height of my ambition to be a political orator, for I had in me that retaliating spirit, and thought there was no better way to give vent to my feelings towards the southern people than to tongue-lash them in politics. But after consulting
a few men I saw that I had the wrong spirit, and that if I accomplished anything it must be through the spirit of love and not of vengeance. If I wanted to be a useful man to my people and country, I would have to learn "that vengeance belongeth to the Lord."
Later I was hired at Lebanon, Tennessee, as teacher. I had a class of forty. The majority of them was old people forty-five and fifty years old. I taught them two terms - each term being only four months. The other four months in the year I worked at most anything I could catch. I became impatient with that slow way of making money, so I resigned my school and went back to Nashville. Through a friend I was given a situation as porter for the Woodruff Sleeping Car Company, which was afterwards bought out by the Pullman Company. I continued in the employment of George L. Pullman for six consecutive years, during which time I was on every road of any importance in the United States and old and New Mexico.
While running from Mackinaw City, Michigan, to Cincinnati, I came near being killed. At Ft. Wayne, Indiana, I stepped off my car while in motion, and was dragged seventy-two feet on my back, all the while hanging to the boxing of the car, the wheels running between my legs. The people turned their backs to keep from seeing me cut to pieces. As the car stopped I relaxed my hold, and they picked me up unconscious, and for some time they thought that life was extinct. They telegraphed my wife that I was dead, but finally I regained consciousness and was returned
home that night on the same train. This laid me up for three months.
After I was restored to my natural strength I accepted a position on board a steamboat on Lake Michigan, as steward or cook, for the Graham Passenger Steamboat Company, plying between St. Joseph and Benton Harbor, Michigan, and Chicago, Illinois. During this time I saw some very stormy seasons. I especially recall one of them - the night the Alpena went down with her human cargo of seventy souls. I was on the steamer Traitor, enroute for Chicago from Green Bay; it was one of the most ferocious seas - so said some of the old captains who had sailed the sea for many years, that they had ever seen. We answered the signals for help sent out by the ill-fated Alpena. Our captain called a council to decide whether we would attempt to go to her aid in the midst of the terrific storm then raging. It was unanimously agreed to take our chances, and the ship was turned about, several times nearly capsizing. Before we succeeded in reaching her the signals ceased and we knew that our efforts had been in vain, for the beautiful steamer Alpena, with every soul on board, had gone down to a watery grave. We finally weathered the storm and landed safely in Chicago harbor. On the return trip I fell over board and had a very narrow escape from death, but the captain soon hauled his vessel to, and picked me up after I had gone down and come up the second time.
In 1877, while cooking at the New England hotel, in Clark street, Chicago, I was one night in the third story of a gambling den, owned and run by two brothers -
Dan and Jim Scott, two very wealthy colored men. They kept hotel, roomers, and ran a gambling den, all in one building. I had drifted away during my railroad and sailing careers into a class of company that led me to this miserable life. It seemed for a time that all the good that had been accomplished through my many friends, and self denial and perseverance, were all overshadowed with darkness, in immorality and sin. But thank God, on New Year's night, 1877, while standing at the gambling table, I heard my mother's voice, as I thought, as audibly as I ever heard it in my life. She said, "my son," in that tender, motherly way in which none save a mother can speak, "is this what you promised me when you were wearing the shackles of bondage?"
I at once recalled the day when mother left me in Wilmington to go back to Greenville, Tennessee, when she said, "son, I have nothing in this world to give you, but remember that manners and good behavior will carry you through the world; get the religion of Jesus in your heart, and if we never meet again on earth meet me in heaven." I resolved on that night that I would not stop until I was converted. All the entreaties and prayers of my mother came rushing upon my mind, and I decided at once that they should not be in vain. My mind fully made up, I left the gambling den that night, never to enter it again.
The next day I accepted a situation as head cook in Evanston, Illinois, eighteen miles from Chicago. I was deeply convicted and began to reason of righteousness, temperance and the judgment to come. The
more I reasoned, the deeper was my conviction, until it seemed that the clock on the wall as it ticked said "repent." I became so interested concerning my soul's welfare, that I could not keep my mind on my business, so I began to seek the Lord in prayer. In June of the same year I walked out of the hotel about eleven o'clock, didn't stop to draw my money; the train was due for Chicago and was at the depot when I arrived there. I was so completely absorbed in thought, and stirred about the salvation of my soul that I walked by the train, up the track towards Chicago. It seemed as though a voice was constantly saying to me, "repent." I had not walked very far when a voice said, "you had better pray." Of course it was the reasoning of the spirit within. I walked down the embankment and for the first time since I was ten years old, I called on God for redemption through the blood of Jesus. I became so intensely earnest that I did not notice the section hands working near by. I arrived in Chicago about dusk, went to a saloon and called for a drink - a very unusual thing for me, because I never went into a saloon before alone. I had often taken a drink through the influence of company. But now, Satan, finding that I was trying to extricate myself from sin, and from the wrath of a sin avenging God, made his greatest struggle to impede my progress. He knew that the wine cup was a sure remedy to carry out his wishes. I never was a lover of strong drink, but now I walked up to the bar and called for gin, as one of the regular hard drinkers would do.
This was one of the remedies that the devil furnished
me to drive away trouble, but it failed in this case; for I took two drinks and it took no effect whatever upon me, for my soul was crying for deliverance. I left the bar room, went to the Union depot and bought a ticket for La Porte, Indiana, but I got off at a little station before I got to La Porte, as I thought of a Baptist preacher I knew about three miles from there. It was midnight, and very dark when I got off the train. I inquired of the depot agent the way to this preacher's home. The road lay through a dense, thick woods, and after wandering until about two o'clock in the morning I found the place.
I remained at his home about three weeks, and would go each day to the woods with him and help him pile up brush, trim trees, etc. I imagined all the while that a tree was going to fall upon me and kill me. The very axe the preacher was chopping with seemed to be crying "repent," and I became so troubled that all hunger and thirst seemed to have left me. There was but one thought uppermost in my mind and that was, "that I might find peace with God."
One day the preacher persuaded me to stay at the house, saying I was too weak to go with him to the woods. He knew what was ailing me, I could tell that in his morning and evening devotion, as he would offer me to the throne of grace with so much fervor. After he was gone I took the shot gun, saying to his wife that I would go hunting. I had gone but a short distance when something seemed to say to me, "you might as well take that gun and blow your brains out."
Of course this was the reasoning of the devil, making his last great effort to decoy me and destroy my soul. But God has promised in His word that He will be a help in every time of need, and this great truth demonstrated itself to me in this hour of peril, for when my foot had almost slipped, and my soul was almost into eternity - where hope is a stranger, and mercy could never reach my undone condition, the great spirit of God whispered in my soul, "woe be unto your damnation."
I hid the gun beneath a brush pile, and started to a man's house about two miles away. As soon as I went into the house he told his wife to hurry dinner and clean up the dinner dishes, and that they would have a word of prayer. I knelt down behind a big drum stove in that log cabin, with my mind fully made up to stay there until God converted me; and in less time than it will take me to tell it I was happily converted to Christ.
It seemed as though I had been wearing a heavy logging chain about my body, and in a moment it fell from me. It looked as if the entire end of the house had given way, and I could see with that eye of faith into the very kingdom of God. I expect one day to behold Christ in His glory, yet I am satisfied that I shall never see Him any plainer, and He will never look any more natural than He did that day in my vision. While beholding this great panorama, Christ handed me a little testament, and pointed towards a large body of woods, saying, "preach my word to these people." In a moment every tree was transformed into a vast multitude of people, and I stepped upon a stump, and began to preach from Romans, First Chapter and sixteenth verse - "Now I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Christ; for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jews first, and also to the Greek."
I need not say to any soul that has been awakened by the light of the gospel that we bad a wonderful downpouring of the spirit that day, and of all the places on earth, that is the dearest to me.
I had worn the shackles of a literal bondage for fifteen years, but in due season God emancipated me from being the goods and chattels of other men, so I could think and act for myself as a man; but thank
God, in 1877, he liberated my soul from a greater bondage, for human bondage enslaves only the body, while sin enslaves both soul and body. But I can now praise God in the highest and sing this song, composed and sung by my people of the southland. It was a song of notification, and alluded to the underground railroad and their preparation for escape into Canada.
"Free at last, free at last,
Thank God Almighty, I'm free at last.
1 When I was a sinner just like you,
Thank God Almighty, I'm free at last,
I prayed and mourned till I came through,
Thank God Almighty, I'm free at last.
2 I never shall forget that day,
Thank God Almighty, I'm free at last;
When Jesus washed my sins away,
Thank God Almighty, I'm free at last.
3 The very time I thought I was lost,
Thank God Almighty, I'm free at last;
My dungeon shook and my chains fell off.
Thank God I'm free at last.
4 This is religion, I do know,
Thank God Almighty, I'm free at last;
For I never felt such a love before,
Thank God Almighty, I'm free at last."
The first night after I was converted, I lay down before the fire place - for it was a log house, with a large, old fashioned fire place. The preacher and his family were eating supper in the same room. He
said he had not stopped talking to me over five minutes when he noticed me clapping my hands and praising God. But in that few minutes I had found myself in a dense wilderness; I could hear the howling and roaring of some kind of a hideous beast that would strike terror to any living soul, and all was gloom and darkness around me. By faith I looked towards the hill of Zion, and, like Peter of old, I cried out, "Lord, save me or I perish." In a moment the darkness dispersed, and the light, in all its splendor and beauty, shone around me. The same man who handed me a testament in the first vision, gave me the same kind of a book, pointed to the trees and said, "preach My word to these people." In a moment every tree and hush was transformed into a multitude of people. I stepped upon the stump and preached from the same text as before. This was Saturday night and I was sixteen miles from La Porte, Indiana.
Sunday morning the preacher, Rev. Bailey, and myself started for La Porte. There were no trains on Sunday morning, so we rode half the distance on a hand-car with the section men, and walked the remainder of the way. We sat on a fence to rest, facing a beech woods, and I rested my head in my hands and closed my eyes. I had a repetition of the same vision, this being the third time that I saw the same thing. I did not tell this part of my conversion for two years afterwards, for I was satisfied that it was a Divine call to the ministry of the Lord Jesus. Ultimately, an old minister, by the name of Andy Ferguson, a member of the A. M. E. church, who was
traveling the La Porte circuit, - after hearing me talk in class meeting several times, asked me to tell him exactly how I was converted. After two years I told him the whole story of my conversion, and he said, "son, I knew God had called you to the ministry." I was wonderfully moved to preach the gospel but felt that I could not afford to give up my occupation of cooking, at which I was making from seventy-five to a hundred dollars per month. for an uncertainty. I knew how hard it was to raise money for the ministers, and like Jonah, I went for nearly five years before I entered the field of labor which God would have me do.
I made several vows and broke them. Finally I vowed if I could accumulate a certain amount of money I would take up the cross and bear it the best I could. I made and saved the amount so quickly that I hardly knew how it came, and avenues were opened to my advantage on every side.
I joined the Missionary Baptist church, though I was of Methodist belief; hut I was cooking where there was no other church save the Baptist. I joined them and gave them fifty dollars toward the building of a new church, with the understanding that if ever a Methodist church was organized there they were to give me a letter of recommendation, and refund twenty-five dollars to the Methodist church. I was soon made a member of the Chain Lake Association of Michigan.
In 1884 a Methodist church was organized and although I was not there, the Baptists refunded the twenty-five dollars. I remained in the Baptist church until 1891, when I joined Simpson's Chapel
M. E. church, Indianapolis, Indiana. I was admitted that same year as a member of the Indiana District conference. In March, 92, at Shelbyville, Kentucky, Bishop Foster took up my credentials as elder in the Baptist church, and gave me a sheep skin or credentials, as elder in the Methodist Episcopal church.
In 1877 I married Miss Alice Goins, of Riverside, Michigan, who held up my arms in the ministry for sixteen years while I tried to preach Christ. There were born to us three children, Dora, Marguerite and William. William died in his infancy. The grim monster, consumption, seized upon my companion, and for five years she bore up like a heroine, many times almost compelling me to go to church and preach, when I was fearful that she would die before I returned. But she would say, "my dear, I'm all right, you may save one soul tonight." She would also quote that passage of scripture: Luke 15th Chapter and 10th verse, which reads, "Likewise I say unto you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth."
On the morning of April 14, 1892, she sat in the door of our home in Grape Creek, Indiana, looking so constantly and distant that it attracted my attention. I asked her what she was looking at so steadily, and her answer was like a thunder bolt to my heart. She said, "I am looking at the beautiful carpet this day for the last time on earth, for I shall eat my supper in heaven tonight." She had me call our daughters. When they came she said, "girls, I am going to leave you and papa. I want you to hold up your papa's arms as I have done for the last sixteen years. I want
you to stay with him until he marries again." She then said to me, "William, I want you to marry as soon as you can find some settled woman. I know you could easily marry some young girl, for you don't look very old, but I want you to marry a settled woman." She continued by saying, "William, you know how I used to set the light in the window for you, and watch for you to come home when I was not able to go with you to your preaching place." I said, "yes, Alice." "Well," said she, "I will set the lamp in the window of heaven, and will wait and watch for you until you come." "Dora, I don't want you to do anything that will hinder your father in the ministry, and pray for him daily that God may sustain him in his labor; be a good girl and meet mamma in heaven."
I called in my family physician; he was so wonderfully touched with the spiritual force and power with which she talked that he could scarcely contain himself. He wrote upon the back of a book, saying: "Reverend, your wife can live but a very short time," and bade me good bye.
The incident relative to the lamp occurred in Lexington, Kentucky, while I was holding a series of revival meetings. She was so low that we did not like to leave her alone while we were at church, but she insisted on the lamp being placed on a table near the bed, so she could read, and said that just at 9:30 she would put it in the window. We could see the light when we reached the top of a hill, and she said, "if you do not see the light in the window when you get to the top of the hill you will know that I have passed
over the river." I recall different times when I thought I had reached the spot where I should see it, and not seeing it fell in despair, thinking she had gone, but others ran ahead and told me that the light was in the window.
None but they who have passed through the trying ordeal of the loss of a wife or husband can sympathize with one in this dark and trying hour.
At half past eight that night members and friends filled my home; at eight forty-five she began to sing a song which she used to sing while in health, "I know my name is written in the Lamb's book of life, I know my name is written in heaven." A few minutes before nine she took my hand and said, "husband, have I been a good wife?" With the very fountains of my heart running over with grief I could say nothing else but "yes, a thousand times, yes."
Though it was my daily study to make her happy yet I could never be able to pay the debt of gratitude I owe her. I feel that all that I am I owe to her for her patience and kindness towards me; for when I would despair, and the gloom of disappointment would gather around me, she would put her arms around my neck, kiss me, and say, "papa, let's pray," and in that plaintive, simple way she would take me and my troubles to God. It was her constant study to see and know that I was happy.
Five minutes past nine the chariot swung low, and a loving wife and mother was gone, as we thought. I was on my knees by the bed, with her head resting on my arm; in my excitement I raised her up, and she
opened her eyes, sang another verse of the same song, asked the church to take care of her husband and daughters, bade us all good bye, and in a moment her spirit had moved out of the old tenement house of clay, and she
"Is now drinking at the fountain,
Where she always will abide;
For she has tasted life's pure water
And her soul is satisfied."
I can never describe that night of sorrow, but thank God the consolation which she left in her dying testimony, and her life for sixteen years, sustained me through every conflict, and has been a great source of joy since her departure. Often since that night, when the clouds would hang low and heavy over me, in my imagination I could hear her say, "be of good cheer."
After the funeral services of my wife I returned to my lonely home and tried to make some plans for the future. Left with two girls one a small child, I was forced to take almost a new start in life. Keeping the younger girl, Marguerite, in school, my daughter Dora and I went out to battle with life and for the Kingdom of God. Many trying incidents and perplexities came to me but the tender, loving voice that had encouraged me in days gone by was hushed in death, and I must needs meet them almost alone.
Finally my plans were laid for five years of Evangelistic service. We began our work in Michigan, and the result of our first year's labor was over eighteen hundred souls brought to Christ. The next year I purchased a tabernacle, with a seating capacity of over fifteen hundred. I hired four good singers, and that was indeed a wonderful year. My record showed over two thousand saved. We then went to Indiana, and for three consecutive years continued in this line of work, after which I accepted the pastorate of a circuit at Greenfield and Martinsville Indiana. We built a splendid church at Martinsville. From here we went to Laurenceville, Illinois where our success was wonderful.
In this town a saloon keeper was happily converted one night. He invited the congregation and myself to his saloon at nine o'clock the next morning for a feast. Curiosity brought a large crowd at the appointed hour. When we had gathered, the saloon keeper, with two other men, rolled out three barrels
of whiskey, several kegs and cases of beer and other intoxicants, and broke them open. Whiskey and beer ran like water in the streets, and the town was intoxicated with the fumes. We praised the Lord for this external instead of internal application.
After two years in this town I returned to Evangelistic work, and have continued in it until the present time. Great meetings have been held in Ohio, Illinois and Wisconsin. The greatest meeting in Illinois was about three years ago. In eight weeks we saw nine hundred people converted and added to the different churches. In Waymond Chapel, Chicago, we held an all night meeting, at which there were seventy conversions. The church quickened and spiritualized, for which I give God the glory.
My daughter Dora helped me in my work until 1897, when she married and went to live in San Francisco, California. Three years later she was taken suddenly ill. After a partial recovery her husband was bringing her to Louisville, Kentucky, to spend the summer with us. Upon reaching Chicago she was taken worse and was hurried to a hospital. I received a letter one morning, asking me to meet her in Chicago. The same afternoon a telegram came from her husband, telling me to come at once if I would see her alive. I started on the first train. I shall never forget that race with death. I reached Chicago the next morning, but too late; her spirit had taken its flight. Her dying words were, that she had gone to join mother, and for me to meet her in glory. With God's help I expect to do so.
As much as unfeeling men talk and preach about "Negro insensibility," and as much as slavery dotes upon her mysterious power of blotting out and annihilating the principles of humanity, yet it is plainly seen that God has planted in the bosom of the black man a quality of His own nature, that the ruthless hand of time and the strong arm of oppression has not extinguished.
To make my point clearer I will explain the usual form of marriage between house slaves. When a couple wished to marry, if the marriage was agreeable to the owners, a wedding feast was spread by them, the colored people furnishing coon, possum and sweet potatoes. When everything was ready the old negro preacher, (who by the way could not read a word) went through a certain form prescribed by the master. If the couple marrying was young, the young mistresses held a broom stick knee high. If the bride and groom were more advanced in years, older ladies held it. At the end of the ceremony the colored preacher said to the bride and groom, "now, when you jump the broom stick I announce you man and wife." This is how the expression you are all so familiar with originated.
I will relate an incident which came under my observation, which will better illustrate this marriage farce. A loving couple, united in the usual way, had lived in harmony for five years and eight months, during which time not a cloud of discord had come between them; nothing had marred their peace but the thought that they must spend their lives in the midst of groaning and cracking of whips, of which they themselves must share a common fate. To make the nuptial ties stronger they had been blessed, as they thought, with a little girl, whose dark eyes and waving hair satisfied Henry that the child was his. One pleasant evening a South Carolinian was seen talking with the master of that happy pair, and coming before the door they both came to a full halt, while the stranger gazed full in the faces of the three, and after a few moments, passed in profound silence, he said to the master: "I'll give it." As they turned away from the door, the silence was broken by a low whisper from the lips of little Mary, saying, "one of us is sold, papa." Like the disciples, they each asked, "is it I?" Morning found them undisturbed, and Mary hurried the work over, and as usual, left the cabin for the cotton field, repeating in her mind, "is it I?" So excited was her mind that she spent another sleepless night, and so conscious was she that she was the victim [from reading in the eye of the Carolinian his predominating passions], that when she left the house she kissed her child and pressed it against her bosom as though she would crush it to death. Reluctantly she closed the door and departed, to return no more forever. The
husband's ears were made sad at noon, when a slave boy said to him, as he called him to the gate, "your wife is sold to South Carolina! I saw her chained in the gang and the last words I heard her say, were, "0! that I had never seen a husband! O! that I had hugged my child to death this morning." But the child's inquiry and the father's answer will show whether humanity was extinct in them:
CHILD.
"O, where has mother gone, papa?
What makes you look so sad?
Why sit you here alone, papa?
Has anyone made you mad?
O, tell me, dear papa.
Has master punished you again?
Shall I go bring the salt, papa,
To rub your back and cure the pain?
FATHER.
Go away my child, you are too bad;
You notice things too soon;
Did you not see that I was sad,
When I came home at noon?
Go to the gate and call mamma,
And see if she's in sight.
The hour is late, I fear your ma
Will not be home tonight.
CHILD.
O no, papa, I am afraid
To go to the gate alone;
I fear there's men in the high grass laid,
To catch little Mary Jones.
But what makes mother stay so long?
'Tis getting very late.
Papa, go bring my mother home,
And I'll stay at the gate.
When mother left me early this morn,
She kissed me and she wept;
I saw the tears come trickling down
Upon the pillow where I slept.
She pressed me to her bosom, hard,
As though it was the last embrace.
She sobbed, but did not say a word,
Nor would she let me see her face.
FATHER.
Pull off your shoes, my dearest child,
And say your evening prayer;
And go to bed and after a while,
Perhaps your mother will be there.
Go hush those little eyes to sleep,
And dream some pretty dream tonight,
Perhaps in the morning when you wake
You'll find all things all right.
CHILD.
O' tell me, papa, don't drive me away,
'Tis dark, the stars are thick and bright.
Is mother sold. O, tell me, I pray,
I fear she'll not be home tonight;
O come papa, come go with me,
Perhaps we'll meet her in the lane;
And then she'll sing a song to me,
And take me in her arms again.
FATHER.
Come here my daughter, come to me,
I find that I must tell you true,
Come now, and sit upon my knee -
The dismal tale I'll tell to you.
Your mother's sold; she's sold, my dear,
Her face you'll see no more.
Her cheering voice no more you'll hear
On this side of Canaan's peaceful shore."
I have gone by the name of "Cowens" in this history, and the reader may be curious to know how I came by the name of "Robinson" as I have not mentioned any of my masters by that name.
Two of my masters were named Cowens, one was Robert E. Lee commander-in-chief of the confederate army, another was Scott, and the fifth was Hadley.
I have told you that my father was prince of a tribe in South Africa known as the Madagascar tribe. They heard the ficticious story of Robinson Cruso. In the African dialect the definition was "Rob-o-bus-sho," meaning Robinson Cruso.
An aunt, who spent sixteen years in South Africa as a missionary, found some of father's relatives, and one of his brothers, supposed to be over ninety years old, gave her a great deal of information concerning our family history.
After a diligent search of over fourteen years for the different members of our family, nine children met with mother and held what today would be known as a family reunion, but then we called it a three days' feast in the wilderness. Each of us had a different name. Our missionary aunt was with us, and after her explanation to us of how father was brought away in slavery we decided to establish a family name and record. After carefully talking it over, a unanimous
vote was taken to discard all other names and hereafter answer to our father's name, which meant Robinson. I am prouder of my father's heathen name than of all the professed christian names that I was compelled to acknowledge while a slave. I pray God that none of us who bear the name of our father will ever bring dishonor to it, and may God help my daughter and me to carry the gospel to his native land.
Will you help us by purchasing our book?
Yours for Christ and Africa.
W. H. ROBINSON.
A charge to keep I have,
A God to glorify;
A never crying,
Assur'd if I my trust betray,
I shall for ever die.
Text. Philippians, 2nd, 9, text represents Christ as the most exalted Being in existence. The cause which moved the pen of inspiration to this divine utterance grew out of a consideration of the degraded and relapsed condition of the church at Philippi, a famous city of the province of Macedonia, situated on the great highway between Thrace and Anapolis.
It was founded possibly by the descendants of Jashet, through the line of Gomer. Philip, the king of the province, remodeled it and gave it its present name, after which it became the metropolis of Western Asia. It was also noted for the products of gold, silver, etc., in whose mines men were engaged in great numbers, thousands of feet beneath the surface. This lucrative traffic brought to Philippi strangers from every nation, hence the city became the central point of scholastic lore and the strong hold of Grecian mythology. Paul had visited this empire of Paganism, A. D. 52, organized the church, and preached Christ unto them, etc.
Date and occasion of the Epistle to the Philippians, A. D., 62. Paul found himself a prisoner at Rome, where he had been sent from Caesasea for trial in the Roman court. The
church at Philippi on learning of his imprisonment raised a collection for him and sent it by Epaphroditus, their minister, who on his arrival at Rome called at the jail, where he found the object of his mission with a chain around his waist and ankle, and hard at work on a tent, for he was a tent maker by trade. The preacher from Philippi informed Paul of the relapsed and degenerated condition of his church in the polluted city of Philippians. Object of the epistle was, first to encourage and confirm the faith of the church in Christ Jesus. Second, to caution it against idolatry and heathen mythology. Third, he warns them to shun Judaizing teachers, and fourth, he sets forth the Divinity of Christ and the exalted position of His dual nature, the last of which is the theme of our discourse, "The Exaltation of the Humanity of Christ."
May we not pause a moment, and with unshod feet approach the holy ground of this sacred mystery, and inquire into this sublime and peerless act of exaltation of humanity? On the last day of creation man was left at the foot of the ladder of the intelligent being, just a little lower than the angels, but the language of the text through the hyposative union clothes him with divinity, lifts him far above all creatures, and makes him a life member of the triune God Head, hence the union of the divine, and human nature stands without a parallel in the annals of events. For this mysterious act the invisible curtains of divinity were drawn back, and the human soul thrown upon the dissecting table of infinite wisdom. The infinity of days steps behind the screen of his incomprehensibleness, stoops and absolves himself into the spiritual and carnal elements of the finite, passes under the fierce rod of chastisement, enters Joseph's tomb, binds the king of terrors to his chariot wheel and leads to captivity the captive, and gives
gifts unto men by removing Eden to Paradise, and the renewal of the moral image of God in the soul by the indwelling of the Holy Spirit.
Hosanna to our conquering King.
All hail Incarnate Love,
Ten thousand songs and glories wait
To crown Thy head above.
Thy victories and thy deathless flame
Through all the world shall run,
And everlasting ages sing
The triumphs Thou hast won.
For through the incarnation man and God are brought face to face; by the death and resurrection they are made friends, and man is placed in a position where he can leap from the eventful stage of immortality to the drama of the immortal, where he can stand in the blazing light of the throne and see Jesus, the second Adam, clothed in divine majesty and ruling the. Things in heaven. Where is heaven, and what are the things referred to in the text? The poet answers the first in the following lines:
"There is a land far away amid the stars
Where they know not the sorrow of time,
Where the pure waters wander through valleys of gold,
And life is a treasure sublime.
Our gaze cannot soar to that beautiful land
But our visions have told of its bliss,
And our souls by the gates of its garden are fanned,
When we faint in the desert of this."
The didactive import of the above delineation directs the eyes of the soul at once to the center of the universe, the sensorium of the Godhead, the home of the angels; a city with blazing walls, and towering spires, shining domes and pearly gates, and whose streets are paved with gold, upon which the feet of the redeemed walk, and where cherubic legions dance upon a sea of glass all mingled with fire, and phalanx of seraphim bask in the golden sunlight of the city of God. These are the things which are in heaven, and they have been described and classified by Dr. Bright, as follows: First, the seraphim, whose duty it is to give glory to God as creator of all things, acknowledging his triune character by crying, Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God of hosts, the whole earth is full of Thy glory. Second, the cherubim. They form the highest order of intelligent creatures, stand in an especial nearness to God, and are engaged in the loftiest adoration and are associated with the mercy seat. Third: This is a superior order of angels, who, under the command of Gabriel, stand as connecting links between God, as creator, and Jesus Christ as mediator, between God and man. Fourth: The fourth is under Michael, the angel liaison of heavens. Warriors who fought the dragon and threw him over the battlement of heaven, down nine times the space that measures day and night to mortal men. The fifth order is under the supervision of Uriel. They compose the fire department, and execute vengeance upon the earth by hurling forth sheeted
flames of red tongued lightning and hot thunder bolts, and belching out liquid and sulphurious flames from burning craters. The sixth order is commanded by the angel Raphael. They are the health officers of the world. The seventh and last is composed of the glorified saints of all ages. The general assembly and church of the first born, which are written in heaven, and the spirits of just men made perfect. All the above are the things which are in heaven, and they are the ones who are commanded in the text to bow at the name of Jesus, for we read in the gospel of peace, that when the incarnate feet of the immaculate touched the Bethlehemic manger chanting legates from glory came to proclaim the Savior's name, the sound was heard upon the plane that God and man were reconciled again. [Things in earth.] "In surveying the great system of nature with a christian and philosophic eye, it may be considered from a different point of view," says the learned Dr. Dick. Hence, in explaining this part of the text, we shall start from a scientific point by noticing, first, the surface of the earth, second, the atmosphere. The student of science is confronted upon the threshold of his observation with countless phenomena, all dissimilar one from another, yet controlled by law of the survival of the fittest. The surface of the earth contains a multiplicity of objects all dissimlar in shape, size, color, motion and substance; craggy cliffs and towering mountains, verdant hills arrayed with clumps of trees and beds of flowers, broad and spacious plains, dotted with cities, towns and hamlets, waving fields of grain, blooming vineyard, meandering rivulets, flowing streams, roaring cataracts and belching volcanoes, bubbling springs, stagnated ponds, spacious lakes and rolling rivers. But let me lengthen the horoscope of imagination a little. Go see the outlines of a picture
whose phenomenal background is far more sublime than the one whose negative lingers in the mental camera of the vision. See the erect form of him who is made in the image of his creator, and around him are gathered the rational and intelligent children of his flesh and blood, beneath whose shadow fifty thousand animal species are leaping and dancing. They are all sizes, from the mite to the elephant, from the creatures of which, if ten thousand of them were united they would not form an object one half the size of a grain of sand; yet all of these animals have organs, joints, limbs, feet, claws, hoofs, wings, fins; some flying, some crawling, some rolling, some walking on two feet, some on four, some on eight and some on eight thousand. Some with two eyes, some with ten thousand. These are some of the things in the earth. Now the chief. Hence, after he fell the whole creation groaned and travailed in pain together, until Calvary's bleeding conqueror burst the seals of Joseph's new tomb and sent up a shout of victory from the church militant to the church triumphant.
"Look, ye saints, the sight is glorious,
See the man of sorrow now,
From the fight returns victorious,
Every knee to Him shall bow.
Hark! those loud triumphant chords!
Jesus takes the highest station,
O what joy the sight affords."
The atmosphere is teeming with rational spirits, sent from God to look after the souls of men. The air we breathe swarms with legions of invisible insects, every drop of water abounds with millions of living beings. The blood is a living
stream of insects, crawling and flowing through the trunk of the animal kingdom, and for aught we know these insects are the underlying principles of our intelligence, for they work on and on from birth until death, as though they were conscious of what they were doing. Hence, these and the spirits in the air, are called upon to bow at the name of Jesus.
Sermon delivered in Allen Chapel, Kansas City, Missouri, July 15th, 1906, by Rev. W. H. Robinson.
"And he spake a parable unto them to this end, that men ought always to pray, and not to faint. Who can pray so that God will hear?" First Ps., 66: - 18. "If I regard iniquity in my heart the Lord will not hear me." It means to look at "with favor," to "respect," "approve," "regard." God will not hear the man who in his heart looks upon sin with any favor or allowance. God looks at sin with abhorence. He is of purer eyes than to behold evil, and cannot look on iniquity, etc. We must have the same attitude toward sin that He has to be heard of Him. If we regard sin He will not regard us when we pray. Herein lies the very simple explanation why many of us pray and are not heard. Second Prov. 28-29. "He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer shall be abomination." He cannot pray so that God will hear. If we turn our ears away from what God says to us in His law, He will turn His ears away from what we say to Him in our prayers. We have an illustration of this in Zach.. Then it came to pass as He cried and they would not hear, so they cried and I would not hear, saith the Lord of Hosts. Many are saying: "The promises of God are not true, God does not hear my prayer." Has God ever promised to hear your prayer? God plainly described the class whose prayers He hears. Do you belong to that class? Are you listening to His words? If not He has distinctly said He will not listen to your prayers. And in not listening to you He is simply keeping His word. Let us notice (Prov. 1: 24-25-28, R. V.) "Because I have called and you have refused! I have stretched out my hand and no man regarded. But ye have set at naught all my counsel and would none of my reproof Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me diligently but they shall not find me." Third, Prov. 21-13. "Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor, he also shall cry but shall not be heard." Third proposition: "Whosoever stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor cannot pray so God will hear. If we will not listen to the poor when they cry unto us in their need, the Lord will not hearken unto us. The world's maxim is, "the Lord helps those who help themselves." Luke 18-9-10-11-12. And he spake this parable unto certain ones of all that I possess."
The truth is, the Lord helps those who help others. Fourth, prayer itself is the first act of faith. The first and most natural and most proper thing for one who honestly wishes to turn from sin and believe on Christ and to be saved,.
Fourth Proposition. The great sinner who is sorry for and humbled by his sin, and who desires pardon, can pray so that God will hear. The question is often asked, "shall we get round. To get him to pray is just the thing to do, "for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. (Rom. 10-3). But how, some one
may ask, can he pray until he has faith? The answer is very simple, hence the necessity of prayer. The text says, men ought always to pray and not to faint. You see when the Lord commanded Ananias to go to the house of Judas, how he shook and trembled and even reminded the Lord of the fact that Saul had come there on a mission of persecution, and at that very moment he had letters of authority from the High Priest to bring back to Jerusalem all that he found calling on the name of Jesus, but when he was informed by the great High Priest and captain of our salvation, that "behold he prayeth," it destroyed every vestige of fear, and he went rejoicing on his mission and greeted him as brother Saul, and Saul laid his desire before Him at once, and that was that His eyes might be opened. It was a prayer from an humble and contrite heart. Hence it was answered. He told him how he was struck blind on the way from Jerusalem to Damascus. He told of the blazing magnetic sun light that shone in his pathway. He told of the voice that spake unto him, (Acts 9-4.) He told of his answer (Acts 5.) It was Saul's first real prayer, though it took the heavy rod of chastisment to bring him to it. God heard and answered his prayer, and will hear yours, sinner, if you will humble yourself before Him. As soon as Paul received strength he began to preach redemption through the blood of Christ. (notice Rom. 1-16). For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ; for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first and also to the Gentile. Hence, men ought always to pray and not to faint. Prayer is the key that unlocks heaven's door, and gives man a foreglimpse of that house not made with hands, and brings him back into full unity with his Father who art in heaven. It takes him back through the moulds of God's eternal power,
and restores the image that was defaced by sin into the likeness of his creator. "For, as in Adam, all die; even so in Christ shall all be made alive." (1st Cor. 15-22).
In the year of 1871, when the gold fever was at its height in Cheyenne, Wyoming, two young men, inspired by the thought of wealth, sacrificed everything, left home and friends for the wilds of that unsettled territory, seeking their fortune. They were quite fortunate and obtained considerable gold, but their anxiety is greater now than it was when they were going, for they were not afraid of losing their lives when they had no gold, but now they are in constant fear. Therefore they had to be on the alert day and night for fear of the band of robbers who would murder them for their gold. Hence one would walk his beat with gun in hand, with a vigilant eye, while the other slept, and vice versa, and they continued this for twenty-eight days until they finally reached the border states. One night the picket discovered a dim light in the distance, quietly awoke his partner and prepared to defend themselves from their supposed enemies. Upon reconnoitering they soon discovered they had reached the border of civilization, and that the dim light discovered was the home of an old christian man and his wife, who were only too glad to give them shelter, and food such as they had. After supper they went up in the loft to go to bed, but not being fully satisfied of their safety, neither undressed. One slept with rifle in hand, while the other sat at the head of the stairs as a sentinel until a late hour in the night, when the angelic voice of the old mother was heard singing one of Zion's praises. The sentinel sprang to his feet, with joy in his soul, as she continued to sing:
"I'm a poor wayfaring stranger,
While journeying through this world of woe,
Yet there's no sickness, toil nor danger,
In that bright world to which I go.
I'm going there to see my father,
I'm going there no more to roam.
I'm just a going over Jordan
I'm just a going over home."
He rushed to the bed, shook his partner, saying: "John, come here quick." His partner seized his gun and started, but he said, "John, lay down your gun and listen." The old folks continued to sing:
"I know dark clouds will gather round me.
I know my way is rough and steep.
Yet brighter fields lie just before me,
Where God's redeemed their vigil keep.
I'm going there to see my mother,
She said she'd meet me when I come.
I'm just a going over Jordan,
I'm just a going over home."
In a moment they stood in silence in each other's arms, with their hearts overflowing with joy. When the silence was broken one said to the other, "John, that sounds like our mothers in old Indiana." About this time the old mother sang the last verse.
"I'll soon be free from every trial,
My body will sleep in the old church yard.
I'll drop the cross of self denial,
And enter on my great reward.
I'm going there to see my Savior,
To sing His praise in heaven's dome;
I'm just a going over Jordan
I'm just a going over home."
After this the old mother prayed one of those earnest, fervent prayers, asking God to watch over and protect the strangers in their home. John said to his partner, "let's undress and go to bed for we're all right; we are in a praying home."
Men ought always to pray and not to faint. Paul, the great Gentile preacher, with Silas, his brother, was cast into the Philippian jail for preaching Christ as the only hope of salvation. They were thrust into prison with their feet in the stocks. (Acts 16-22-28th verse). Paul might have asked this question of his companion; "why do we stay in this dungeon, with our feet in the stocks and our backs bleeding? Where is the Christ that met me on the highway to Damascus? Where is the God of our fathers, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, who trusted in God and conquered every foe? He has promised not to leave nor forsake us." Let us sing one of the songs of Zion, after which they prayed until the heavens vibrated and reverberated with the prayers of these saints, and God sent down some of heaven's embassadors, some of the swift winged messengers, and as they hovered above that prison the prison was shaken from center to circumference, and the bolts and bars were loosened, and God unlocked the
shackles and manacles that held them in the stocks, and they walked out into the corridor of the jail praising God in the highest. The jailer felt the shaking of the prison as a mighty earthquake. He rushed into the prison and seeing the doors all opened, and seeing no man he drew his sword and would have taken his own life, for it was certain death for a Roman soldier to allow a prisoner to escape. that night the Philippian jailer and his house were converted and baptized unto God, the result of prayer.
Men ought always to pray and not to faint.
"Prayer is the soul's sincere desire,
Unuttered or expressed,
The motion of a hidden fire
That trembles in the breast -
Prayer is the simplest form of speech
That infant lips can try;
It lifts us from the mire and clay
And plants our feet on high.
Oh, Thou, by whom to God, we come,
The truth, the life, the way,
The path of prayer Thyself hath trod,
Lord, teach us how to pray."
Sermon delivered by Rev. W. H. Robinson, Albia, Iowa, A. M. E. Church, March 28th, 1907.
"Go through, go through the gates, prepare ye the way of the people, cast up, cast up the highway, gather out the stones, lift up a standard for the people." This is the prophet's fervent zeal for God's promises to his church. Ministers are incited to like importunity. Isaiah, the son of Amos, prophesied B. C. 760 years, or about that time. God has had a man for every time, emergency and purpose. When He would raise up a people to Himself, he called Abraham, a Chaldean. When He would preserve that people's life He prepared a Joseph. When He would lead those people to a land of promise he called a Moses, a fugitive from Egypt. When He heard the cries from the Babylonian captives, who cried by reason of their sore affliction, he had a Nehemiah. When he heard the cries of the slaves in the southland He called in Abraham Lincoln, from the Log Cabin in Kentucky, to be the chief magistrate of this great nation. Although the nation was baptized in human blood, and Lincoln died the death of a martyr, he became the great standard of liberty in
America. When the voices of the Cubans and the Philipinoes reached the throne of our God He gave to us a William McKinley, who dared to do and to die because he was inspired by the Holy Ghost, all of whom became great standards for God and suffering humanity.
Isaiah declared for Zion's sake he would not hold peace, and for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest until the righteousness thereof go forth as brightness, and the salvation thereof as a lamp that burneth and the Gentiles shall see their righteousness and all Kings thy Glory, and thou shalt be called by a new name which the mouth of the Lord shall name. Thou shalt also be a crown of glory in the hands of the Lord and a royal diadem in the hand of thy God. This subject has a two-fold meaning; a spiritual and literal. The spiritual and literal. The spiritual, Isaiah points the people to the coming King, and said to his kingdom there should he no end. [See Isaiah 9-6.] For unto us a child is horn, unto us a son is given, and the government shall he upon His shoulders, and His name shall be called wonderful counselor, the almighty God, the everlasting father, the Prince of Peace. (Isaiah 9-7: Of the increase of His government and peace there shall be no end. Upon the throne of David and upon his kingdom, to order it anti to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth, even forever. (See Isaiah 63; 1st to 6th verses). arms brought salvation unto me, and my fury it upheld me, and this is the great standard that was to be a light to the feet of the Gentiles, and a lamp to the pathway that was to shine away the darkness of the valley of the shadow of death. (Text) "Go through, go through the gates, prepare ye the way of the people. Cast up, cast up the highway, gather out the stones, lift up a standard for the people." The four gates to the garden of Eden were closed by the fall of Adam. The four gates of the city of New Jerusalem were opened by the birth, suffering death, resurrection, and ascension of the Lord Jesus Christ. For death reigned from Adam to Christ, but life shall reign from time to eternity, for Jesus said (St. John 11:25). "I am the resurrection and the life, he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live (26th) and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die." (See Matthew 3: 1st to 4th verses.)  path straight." John was the great standard of righteousness in the wilderness. Then cometh Jesus from Gallilee to Jordan unto John to be baptized of him. But John forbade Him, saying, "I have need to be baptizied of thee; and cometh ascending and descending like a dove and lighting upon Him, and lo, a voice from heaven saying, this is thy beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.
And this is the standard that Isaiah saw through the spirit more than 760 years before he came, and prophesied concerning Him. Priests and prophets prayed to see the light of the coming king, who was to redeem Israel from the curse of a broken law, for the sentence of death was passed upon all men. Therefore (Job 14- 14) ask this question: "If a man die shall he live again?" And Jesus, the standard of salvation, answered and said, "because I live ye shall live also." (John 14-19.) And he said unto Mary and Martha, the two orphan girls who had lain their only brother in the silent city of the dead and were now kneeling at the feet of Jesus and bewailing their loss, when Martha said unto Him, "if thou hadst been here my brother had not died, but I know that even now whatsoever
thou ask of God, God will give it thee," Jesus said unto her, "thy brother shall rise again." "Martha said unto Him, "I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day." Jesus said unto her, "I am the resurrection and the life, he that believeth in me, though he were dead yet shall he live:" (John 11 -21 and 25th verses). So the world need not worry or have any fear concerning eternal life, for God has so declared that before one jot or tittle of His word shall fail, heaven and earth shall pass away. (Rev. 21:1-3). And John declared "he we know that it must have been a beautiful sight that dazzled the eyes of the most expectant. "And I heard A great voice out of heaven saying, behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will dwell with them and they shall be His people, and God himself shall be with them and be their God." This is a glorious promise. This destroys the very fear of death from the minds of God's true pilgrims, so that they wade out into the turbulent waters of the valley and shadow of death, and, like David the shepherd king, defy the presence of death. And as he sees the approaching of the grim monster, he buckles on armour, his habiliment, girds up his loins - with a girdle of God's eternal truth, tries his shield that bears the marks of many spears shot at him by the enemy,
unsheathes his sword and marches out to meet the last enemy to be conquered, which is death.
Hush! I hear the din of the battle. It is fierce, long and loud. The combatants on one side are fighting for truth and righteousness; the other side for death and destruction. The captain on one side is Apolian, the prince of the powers of the air. The other one is the Alpha and Omega. the beginning and the end, the first and the last, who conquered the powers of death and hell, robbed the grave of her victory and death of its sting, mounted the clouds of the morning with a convoy of angels as his escort, soared back to his father's house with a promise of another comforter to the world, and sitteth at the right hand of God the Father Almighty, where he maketh intercession for the Saints.
The great standard of righteousness, the literal side of the prophet's definition, points to the Babylonian captivity. Looking down through the telescope of time, he sees the Israelites, the chosen people of God, the Abrahamic seed, 767 years before the event really takes place, led away from Jerusalem, and their native land, by Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, captives. Isaiah heard the echo of their wails, and the deep groaning of their souls as they are marching from their native land destined to a life of servitude which must last for 70 years. They yet bear the scars and sore feet of weary years of an Egyptian bondage, where they toiled 450 years under Pharaoh, the King of Egypt. Led out by Moses, God's standard bearer, they could hear the hoof and steel of Pharaoh's horses
and chariots. They could hear the stern command of that mighty king, urging his army on to overtake them. I can hear their wails to Moses, their leader and standard bearer. I can see Moses, God's standard bearer, as he goes to headquarters for orders, as he listens to the tramp of his enemies, and the rumbling of their chariot wheels. He makes this inquiry; "Lord, what shall I do?" God said to him; "tell the people to stand still and see the salvation of God, for the enemy you see today you shall soon see them no more forever." He commanded Moses to take the staff that he had in his hand, and pass it three times over the waters of the Red Sea, and the water became frightened at itself, for God sent down a trade wind that night and divided the water from the water. Having thus pontooned the Red Sea, dry land appeared, and the people marched over dry shod. God put a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night, so it was darkness to the Egyptians by day and by night, but light to the Israelites. When Israel had crossed the Red Sea and the Egyptians attempted to do the same, God spoke to the waters, and the Egyptians were destroyed. Israel looked back, and sang this triumphant song:
"Isaac, a ransom while he lay
Upon the altar bound;
Moses, an infant cast away,
By Pharaoh's daughter found.
Didn't old Pharaoh get lost,
Get lost: get lost?
Oh, didn't old Pharaoh get lost,
All in the Red Sea?"
Said they, the horseman and his rider are over-thrown, and God has delivered his people from the hand of Pharaoh?"
[Text] Lift up a standard for the people. They wandered forty years in the wilderness. They were unfaithful and unthankful. They murmured and complained all the time. When they were hungry, God fed them bread made up by the spoken word of His Power and fed it to them fresh and flakey every morning. And Jesus says I am the bread of life. Jesus is to the soul what the manna was to the body of the Israelites. For forty years they wandered in the wilderness, because of their disobedience, and today the church of God is wandering because of retrogration from the true standard of God. We are taking on too much of the world, and too little of God. Israel's sins led them into many pitfalls. Finally they were bitten by the fiery serpents, and died by the thousands. God commanded Moses, the standard bearer, to mould a serpent of brass and lift it up in the wilderness and to tell the people to look upon it and they should be healed. But thousands died because they would not look. Jesus said, "as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the son of man be lifted up." As the great standard of the human family, the Lord help us to look and live. Sinners, which will
you do? Look and live, or close your eyes and die? (Text) Lift up a standard for the people. (See illustration). In 1869 your humble servant made a trip to London, England. While there I met a German whose sympathy was very strong for me and my people in this country, and we were together nearly every day while there. He had been a sailor for forty years, and I being a natural born mariner it blended us very close together. We would stand upon the pier of that great harbor, where we could see the white winged doves of commerce coming from every civilized quarter of the earth, and as I saw the different flags at the mastheads I would say to my friend. "where does that ship come from?" Without waiting to read the inscription on the ensign he would say, "from Italy". "And this one?" "from France." "And this?" from Germany." "And this?" from Russia." "And this" "from Spain etc." But when I saw the old star spangled banner I did not have to ask any questions. I knew it was the standard that was unfurled over me at Blue Springs, Tennessee. In November, 1863, just after being captured from the confederate army, General Thomas had me stand in the door of his tent, and ordered the national flag unfurled. It was very calm, not a breath of air stirring, but just as General Thomas stepped to my side it seemed as if God sent a providential breeze along, and it wrapped the old flag all around us. General Thomas, who controlled the union army of the Tennessee said, "today this flea makes you a free man." I wept for joy, standing under the great standard of liberty, for I could now sing the
national air, the land of the free and the home of the brave. In the true sense of patriotism I had worn the shackles of literal bondage for years, but in due season God emancipated me from being the goods and chattels of other men, so I could think and act for myself as a man. But thanks be to God, in 1877, he emancipated my soul from the bondage of sin.
When I saw the standard of America I asked no questions. So it ought to he with every true child of God, who has been freed from the bondage of sin, and made heirs and joint heirs of the Lord Jesus Christ and become such lofty standards that we would be living epistles, read and known of all men as the standards of Jesus. (Text). Lift up a standard for the people. There are so many ways we can be standards. First, by faithfulness to the cause we represent. Second, by our Christian fidelity, truth and righteousness. Love God supremely. Be at peace with all men. In order to do this we must keep aloft the standard of prayer, which is a weapon sharper than any two edged sword. It is a standard of power that even the heathen in the jungles of Africa recognize and reverence, though their deity is nothing but a dumb idol. They bow down to it and utter some form of prayer. Hence we can see the necessity of the standard of prayer. (See illustration). In 1871 this country sent a representative to Madrid, Spain. In the Spanish courts they found some technicality in the official acts of Mr. Woods. They gave him a trial and sentenced him to death, and within three days of the time of execution the law said, a man sentenced to death must be executed
the very day and minute specified in his sentence. If not, it gave him sufficient grounds for a new trial. The honorable James G. Blaine was at that time secretary of war, and saw the necessity of prolonging the time, so that Mr. Woods could have a fair and impartial trial, that he might vindicate himself. He asked Queen Victoria, of England, to order her representatives, with the flag of her country, to be on the spot of execution. He also made the same request to the czar of Russia. He ordered an American representative, with the stars and stripes, with the other nations, and a few minutes before the time of execution they wrapped Mr. Woods up in these three flags. Twenty four men, with loaded guns, are waiting for orders to send the leaden messenger of death into the body of Mr. Woods. The time is up. Attention is called But there is no command to fire. The question is asked, "why don't you give the command to shoot? The time is up." The answer is, "how can we shoot a man through the flags of three great nations?" The time of execution is past. Mr. Woods was taken back to prison, had a fair and impartial trial, and was set at liberty. Now, if the standards of three nations can save a man from a literal death, what must the standard of Calvary do? Every strand of thread in that flag is stained in the blood of Calvary's lamb. And Jesus said unto the dying thief, "today shalt thou be with me in paradise." (Text): Lift up the standard for the people. He was crucified, dead and buried. The third day he arose from the dead, and said, "I am he that liveth, and was dead, and behold I am alive forevermore, and have the keys of death and hell. Amen."
The following are a few voluntarily contributed testimonials by friends who have read my life's history work entitled, "From Log Cabin to the Pulpit," all of which I most heartily appreciate and extend my sincere and earnest thanks to those who have thus taken such warm interest in both myself and daughter, and in the work we are endeavoring to accomplish for humanity through the aid of and in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, our Savior, and the Savior of all mankind who wish his help and are willing to follow him and his teachings. God extends his help to all.

TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:
I have been personally acquainted with Rev. W. H. Robinson, of this city, for several years. I have read his book, "From Log Cabin to the Pulpit," which contains his life's history and reminiscences of the Civil war, which gave him his freedom from slavery, and I cannot recommend either him or his publication too highly, and hope all my friends will read this history of his life.
Respectfully Yours,
G. E. CLARK, D. D. S.
EAU CLAIRE, WIS., JUNE 14, 1913.
I believe that the story of the life of W. H. Robinson, as told by himself, is one of those interesting bits of personal history, reaching back into the slavery days of our nation. I also believe that the purpose of the man himself is high and earnest. He is trying to make his life count for the best things.
Sincerely,

I have known W. H. Robinson for some time, and am glad to give personal testimony to my belief in him as an earnest, honest, consecrated christian gentleman.

It is a genuine pleasure to write a word of appreciation of "From Log Cabin to the Pulpit." It is a pleasure because of the intrinsic worth of the book, and the writer's appreciation of the personal character of the author.
No one of a religious spirit can read this book without having his faith in the fact of God's providential care in the behalf of the humblest of His children greatly strengthened. The book is of worth also as a contribution to the history of the institution of slavery, and of the epoch of emancipation. This autobiography makes for optimism, and inspires the reader to a more manful fight to attain spiritual freedom. He who reads this book will be a better man for spending a time with our author in the recital of this own God guided life from slavery to freedom.
We wish for this book a large circulation, and bid it God speed on its mission.
S. A. BENDER.
In 1910 we became residents of Eau Claire. I want to say that I have traveled quite extensively, at home, and abroad, but I have never met such a body of warm hearted ministers as in Eau Claire; men who at once became interested in my daughter and self, and seemed to have no thought of the "black rubbing off." They belong to that class of men who look beyond the color of the skin or the texture of the hair, and they immediately extended a brotherly hand. "As the priest, so the people." Like a strong cable they have held me up. With one hand in God's, and the other in the hands of the good people in Eau Claire I could not fall.
My first service here was in the Lake Street Methodist Episcopal Church, by invitation of Rev. Guy W. Campbell and his good people. I preached four nights and gave a lecture entitled, "From Log Cabin to the Pulpit." God raised up in a very short time many, many warm hearted friends in that church. See letter of recommendation written. to Rev. C. H. Harris, pastor of the Holcombe Methodist Episcopal Church, Holcombe, Wisconsin.

EAU CLAIRE, WIS., OCT. 18, 1910.
REV. C. H. HARRIS,
Holcombe, Wis.
Dear Brother: - I tried to get you by phone Sunday evening but could not. Now I will try you by letter.
I have recently had a negro and his daughter hold a few nights' services in my church. He is an ex-slave and a very good speaker. He spoke three nights in succession in my church and then gave a lecture on the subject, "From Log Cabin to the Pulpit" His sermons and lecture were good.
Now he wants to put in a few weeks around here before he goes to Texas to take up Evangelistic work there. I could get him for you for the first of next week, beginning the 24th if you desire him. He will come on this arrangement. Your church will provide entertainment, he will preach three nights and then give the lecture for 25 and 10 cents a ticket, the proceeds of which he takes as his compensation.
He was at the Salvation Army Barracks here last week, and they were so pleased with his work that they insisted on his staying this week also.
I spoke to Brother Straw last week about getting this man a few nights' appointments about here, and he immediately suggested Holcombe. He has heard
him preach and give his lecture, and desired me to convey his unqualified recommendation to you.
We will not have many opportunities from now on to secure such men. Their ranks are being thinned about as fast as those of the old soldiers. This will give your young people an opportunity to hear and see a real ex-slave.
Now if you want this man write me as soon as possible. His name is W. H. Robinson. He and his daughter are fairly good singers also.
Sincerely,
GUY W. CAMPBELL.
We spent two weeks in Holcombe with the result that twenty-five were happily converted and united with the church. From there we went to other points in Wisconsin. In Eau Claire and vicinity, to date, we have seen over eight hundred people born into the Kingdom of God, for which we give Him the glory, for God forbid that I glory in anything save the cross of Christ. May God bless the people of Eau Claire for their kindness to us.
I want to thank my landlord, Mr. Stephen D. Hoover, and Mr. A. V. Mayhew, who made it possible for me to finance this edition of my history. I appreciate their true friendship. May they live long to do much good for the Master's Kingdom; also Mr. B. R. Barland, real estate man, for his untiring interest in us.
Believing that the large and fruitful work extending over a series of years by the Rev. W. H. Robinson, as an Evangelist, and his daughter assisting him as a singer, is worthy of recognition, and to the end that loyal effort, in the cause of truth and righteousness may not go unrewarded.
I believe the good people of Eau Claire will join with me in the sentiment and aid which have enabled the worthy Evangelist to publish in book form a narrative of his very interesting life; a life beginning as a slave, with its atrocious incidents; his experiences as a union soldier; the acquiring of an education, and the consecrated use of that education for the uplifting of humanity; the object of such publication being the very commendable desire to carry the gospel to his people in Africa, his father's native land.
If we as citizens, and friends of humanity, will each purchase a copy, we will certainly get value received from the contents of this valuable book, and at the same time help him to answer the call of His Master, "Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature.
B. R. BARLAND.
I wish also to thank the publisher and his helpers for the interest taken in me, and for the good work they have done in getting out a more presentable book than the former ones were. Their suggestions and help in various ways have enabled me to re-edit my book, and to bring this edition up to a higher standard.
I send this little book on its mission of love to all.
Yours for Christ,
W. H. ROBINSON.University of Missouri

Counties served: St. Louis of. There he sat, being come forth from the sea, and he had pity on the Achaeans that they were overcome by the Trojans, and against Zeus was he mightily wroth.
[17].
[32] There is a wide cavern in the depths of the deep mere, midway between Tenedos and rugged Imbros. There Poseidon, the Shaker of Earth, stayed his horses, and loosed them from the car, and cast before them food ambrosial to graze upon, and about their feet he put hobbles of gold, neither to be broken nor loosed, that they might abide fast where they were against the return of their lord; and himself he went to the host of the Achaeans.
[39] But the Trojans, all in one body, like flame or tempest-blast were following furiously after Hector, son of Priam, with loud shouts and cries, and they deemed that they would take the ships of the Achaeans, and slay thereby all the bravest. Howbeit Poseidon, the Enfolder and Shaker of Earth, set him to urge on the Argives, when he had come forth from the deep sea, in the likeness of Calchas, both in form and untiring voice. To the two Aiantes spake he first, that were of themselves full eager: "Ye Aiantes twain, ye two shall save the host of the Achaeans, if ye are mindful of your might, and think not of chill rout. Not otherwhere do I dread the invincible hands of the Trojans that have climbed over the great wall in their multitude, for the well-greaved Achaeans will hold back all; nay it is here that I have wondrous dread lest some evil befall us, here where yon madman is leading on like a flame of fire, even Hector, that boasts him to be a son of mighty Zeus. But in the hearts of you twain may some god put it, here to stand firm yourselves, and to bid others do the like; so might ye drive him back from the swift-faring ships, despite his eagerness, aye, even though the Olympian himself be urging him on."
[59], and my feet beneath and my hands above are full fain."
[76] Hector, Priam's son, that rageth incessantly."
[81].
[89] But the Shaker of Earth,. Nay, let us atone for the fault with speed: the hearts of good men admit of atonement., fencing spear with spear, and shield with serried each other, as they were brandished, and their minds swerved not, but they were fain to fight.
[136].
[169] But the rest fought on, and a cry unquenchable arose., holding it in their jaws high above the ground, even so the twain warrior; and it fell in the dust before the feet of Hector.
[206], are the threats gone, wherewith the sons of the Achaeans threatened the Trojans?"
[221] And to him Idomeneus, leader of the Cretans, made answer: "O Thoas, there is no man now at fault, so far as I wot thereof; for we are all skilled in war. Neither is any man holden of craven error,, therefore now cease thou not, but call to every man."
[231]."
[239] So spake he, and went back again, a god into the toil of men;."
[254] To him again the wise Meriones made answer: ."
[259] And to him Idomeneus, leader of the Cretans, made answer: , and helms, and corselets gleaming bright."
[266] Then to him the wise Meriones made answer: "Aye, in mine own hut also and my black ship are many spoils of the Trojans, but I have them not at hand to take thereof. For I deem that I too am not forgetful of valour, but I take my stand amid the foremost in battle, where men win glory, whenso the strife of war ariseth. Some other of the brazen-coated Achaeans might sooner be unaware of my fighting, but thou methinks of thine own self knowest it well."
[274] And to him Idomeneus, leader of the Cretans, made answer: "I know what manner of man thou art in valour; what need hast thou to tell the tale thereof? For if now all the best of us were being told off besides the ships for an ambush, wherein the valour of men is best discerned—there the coward cometh to light and the man of valour; for the colour of the coward changeth ever to another hue, nor is the spirit in his breast stayed that he should abide steadfast, but he shifteth from knee to knee and resteth on either foot, and his heart beats loudly in his breast as he bodeth death, and the teeth chatter in his mouth; but the colour of the brave man changeth not, neither feareth he overmuch when once he taketh his place in the ambush of warriors, but he prayeth to mingle forthwith in woeful war—not even in such case, I say, would any man make light of thy courage or the strength of thy hands. For if so be thou wert stricken by a dart in the toil of battle, or smitten with a thrust, not from behind in neck or back would the missile fall; nay, but on thy breast would it light or on thy belly, as thou wert pressing on into the dalliance of the foremost fighters. But come, no longer let us loiter here and talk thus like children, lest haply some man wax wroth beyond measure; nay, but go thou to the hut, and get thee a mighty spear."
 do the long-haired Achaeans so fail in the fight."
[311] And to him again Idomeneus, leader of the Cretans, made answer: "Among the midmost ships there be others for defence, the two Aiantes, and Teucer, best of all the Achaeans in bowmanship,."
[328] of mighty strife and evil war, and drew them taut over both armies, a knot none might break nor undo, that loosed the knees of many men.
[361]."
[383] So saying, the warrior Idomeneus dragged him by the foot through the mighty conflict. But Asius came to bear aid to Othryoneus,, and the horses Antilochus, son of great-souled Nestor, drave forth from the Trojans into the host of the well-greaved Achaeans.
[402] Then Deïphobus in sore grief for Asius drew very nigh to Idomeneus, and cast at him with his bright spear. Howbeit Idomeneus, looking steadily at him, avoided the spear of bronze, for he hid beneath the cover of his shield that was well-balanced upon every side, the which he was wont to bear, cunningly wrought with bull's hide and gleaming bronze, and fitted with two rods; beneath this he gathered himself together, and the spear of bronze flew over; and harshly rang his shield, as the spear grazed thereon, even as he fareth to the house of Hades, the strong warder, will he be glad at heart, for lo, I have given him one to escort him on his way!"
[417] So spake he, and upon the Argives came sorrow by reason of his exulting, and beyond all did he stir the soul of wise-hearted Antilochus; howbeit, despite his sorrow, he was not unmindful of his dear comrade, but ran and bestrode him, and covered him with his shield. Then two trusty comrades stooped down, even Mecisteus, son of Echius, and goodly Alastor, and bare Hypsenor, groaning heavily, to the hollow ships.
[424] And Idomeneus slackened not in his furious might, but was ever fain., for ever was Aeneas wroth against goodly Priam, for that brave though he was amid warriors Priam honoured him not a whit.."
[468] So spake he, and roused the heart in the breast of Aeneas, and he went to seek Idomeneus, with high thoughts of war.. Were we but of like age and our mood such as now it is, then forthwith should he win great victory, or haply I."
[487] So spake he, and they all, having one spirit in their breasts, took their stand, each hard by the other, leaning their shields against their shoulders. And Aeneas over against them called to his comrades,, when he saw the throng of the host that followed after him.
[496] Then over Alcathous they clashed in close fight with their long spears, and about their breasts the bronze rang terribly as they aimed each at the other in the throng; and above all the rest two men of valour,, where also were the other immortal gods, being held aloof from the war.
[526] Then over Ascalaphus they clashed in close fight, and Deïphobus tore from Ascalaphus his shining helm, but Meriones, the peer of swift Ares, leapt upon Deïphobus and smote his arm with his spear,.
[560]. Even there he fixed his spear, and the other, leaning over; and darkness enfolded his eyes.
[576]; and down upon the eyes of Deïpyrus came the darkness of night, and enfolded him.
[581], even a sling that his squire carried for him, the shepherd of the host.
[601] But Peisander made straight at glorious Menelaus; howbeit an evil fate was leading him to the end of death, to be slain by thee, Menelaus, in the dread conflict. And when they were come near, as they advanced one against the other,, and had no fear at heart of the grievous wrath of Zeus, that thundereth aloud, the god of hospitality,.
[643] Then there leapt forth against him the son of king Pylaemenes, even Harpalion, that followed his dear father to Troy unto the war,. But as he drew back, Meriones let fly at him a bronze-tipped arrow, and smote him on the right buttock, and the arrow passed clean through even to the bladder beneath the bone. And sitting down where he was in the arms of his dear comrades he breathed forth his life, and lay stretched out like a worm on the earth; and the black blood flowed forth and wetted the ground. Him the great-hearted Paphlagonians tended, and setting him in a chariot they bare him to sacred Ilios, sorrowing the while, and with them went his father, of the Achaeans and the hateful disease, that he might not suffer woes at heart. Him Paris smote beneath the jaw, under the ear, and forthwith his spirit departed from his limbs, and hateful darkness gat hold of him.
[673] So fought they like unto blazing fire; but Hector, dear to Zeus, had not heard, nor wist at all, and had burst the close ranks of the Danaan shield-men, even in the place where were the ships of Aias and Protesilaus, drawn up along the beach of the grey sea, and beyond them the wall was builded lowest; there, as in no place beside, the men and their horses waxed furious in fight.
[685] There the Boeotians and the Ionians,, were fighting in defence of the ships together with the Boeotians.
[701], fought with the Trojans and with Hector in his harness of bronze, and the others behind kept shooting from their cover; and the Trojans bethought them no more of fight, for the arrows confounded them.
[723] Then in sorry wise would the Trojans have given ground from the ships and huts unto windy Ilios,, I fear lest the Achaeans shall pay back the debt of yesterday, seeing there abideth by the ships a man insatiate of war, who no longer, methinks, will hold him utterly aloof from battle."
[748] So spake Polydamas, and his prudent counsel was well pleasing unto Hector, and forthwith he leapt in his armour from his chariot to the ground;."
[754] So spake he, and set forth, in semblance like a snowy mountain,."
[774] Then spake unto him again godlike Alexander: , and as for us, we will follow with thee eagerly, nor, methinks, shall we be anywise wanting in valour, so far as we have strength; but beyond his strength may no man fight, how eager soever he be."
[788] So spake the warrior, and turned his brother's mind; and they set out to go where the battle and the din were fiercest,—they that shall bear thee citywards, coursing in dust over the plain."
[821] to abide my long spear, that shall rend thy lily-like skin; and thou shalt glut with thy fat and thy flesh the dogs and birds of the Trojans, when thou art fallen amid the ships of the Achaeans."
[833] So spake he, and led the way; and they followed after with a wondrous din, and the host shouted behind..Chicago Web Development, Web Design & Internet Marketing

For complete coverage and results from the Barnard Town Meeting, look inside the Vermont Standard’s March 7 edition.
The following story was first published in the February 28, 2013 edition of the Vermont Standard, in the town meeting preview pages.
$1.8 Million Budget Before Barnard Voters
Barnard voters will be asked to vote on a budget
that’s $183,562 higher than last year’s approved
budget but, Selectboard head Tom Morse said,
but residents should know that this budget is closer to
what the town’s actually been spending.
Additionally, costs from Irene repair account for
much of it.
“You have to keep in mind that $550,000 of that
represents spending by FEMA and a state grant that is
offset,” Morse said.
Last year’s amount to be raised by taxes was
$643,028 and the FY14 figure is $826,590 out of a
$1,822,440 budget.
“If you’re going to compare it to last year’s, you
have to look at the FEMA expenses, and the road
money,” he said.
“Most of the ‘up’ is in
highway, for items like
gravel, sand, fuel and
insurance,” Morse said.
Morse said that even
with those considerations,
“the amount to be raised
by taxes is up, but it’s shrinking and we intend to see it
shrink more next year.”
The town’s current tax rate is 23 cents per $100
of assessed value, the lowest municipal tax rate in
Windsor County.
The new tax rate won’t be set in stone until a threepart,
town-wide appraisal is finished.
“It’s been a three-year rolling appraisal and we
expect the final part to finish up in April,” Morse said,
“and until that’s finished I won’t have a firm hand on
the grand list until then.”
However, he said, “If I were to guess, I’d say we’re
adding about three cents onto the current rate.”
Morse said that Vermont towns are waiting longer
than they have in years past to figure their tax rates.
“We don’t hurry that up anymore because we don’t
get the state education tax right off the bat,” he said.
“It used to be possible to set a tax rate earlier. Now we
have to wait for the state.”
One article on the warning asks if the town will vote
$15,000 toward a feasibility study on construction of a
new emergency services building and fire station. The
$15,000 would cover a survey, septic design plans, an
engineering study and architectural presentation. The
current building is old and in need of repair.
The building would be located on land near the Town
Hall that the town already owns.
“When we bought the Town Hall,” Morse said, “the
town approved purchasing the land, with the idea that
in the future we’d want to put a Post Office or a fire
station or something like that here.”
“It’s not something the selectboard initiated, but it’s
something we approved,” Morse said of the article.
One selectman, Tim Johnson, has a term ending, but
no one has stepped forth to challenge his seat.
The budget for Barnard’s school district has a much
more subtle leap; this year’s figure of $1.05 million is
an increase of 1.9 percent over the current $1,026,043.
An approved school budget would add about 2.4 cents
on the tax rate.
School Board Chairman David Green said Tuesday
that the town’s school budget will be voted on in two
parts, due to a state law. The first vote will be for
$1.04 million and the second will be for the remaining
$6,658.
“The legislature a number of years ago wanted to
sort of slow the pace of increase in the school budgets,
because they’ve historically been rising in the state
with inflation — and we have a declining student
body,” Green said. “My understanding is there have
been very few of these split votes in prior years. This
year, I understand that there are something like forty in
the state.”
Green said the school opted to cut out use of one of
the two school buses it uses, rather than cut hours of
any staff or teachers for the upcoming budget.
“We are always hesitant to make any changes to
personnel when we have students who work closely
with and are accustomed to them,” he said.
“In Barnard we kept our gross expense increase
down to less than two percent. But what they really
measure is what’s called the net expenditure – salary,
buses, heat, minus revenue that comes in from the
state. And our revenue went down,” Green said. “Plus
traditionally we’ve had one tuition student, and this
year we’re not sure if one’s going to show up for next
year.”
Green said the school had a fourteen percent increase
in the projected cost of health care for employees.
“You do all this budget stuff in a vacuum without
really knowing how many students, the state tax rate,
and so you’re sort of reaching out in the dark,” Green
said.

- Activity: Hike
- Distance: 4 mile loop trail
- Time:
A morning spent exploring the rolling hills of this 185-acre wilderness museum will introduce visitors to nearly 9,000 tree and plant specimens from around the globe. Along the arboretum’s 12-mile system of interconnected trails, hikers can ogle enormous coastal redwoods, duck under leafy shoots of towering bamboo, admire a grove of blooming dogwood trees, or simply plop down on a well-placed park bench to soak up the sun and enjoy the fact that this woodsy oasis is only two miles away from downtown Portland.
ROUTE: With some 20 trails crisscrossing this city park’s grounds, even a tried-and-true outdoorsman could lose his way. Fortunately the arboretum’s cozy visitor center comes well-stocked with a bevy of free maps outlining hikes ranging from one to four miles. The four-mile option begins just north of the visitor center and winds past many of Hoyt’s seasonal highlights, including an impressive collection of flowering magnolia trees, many of which begin to sprout their starlike blossoms this month.
For a shorter jaunt that lets you explore the Arboretum in less than 2 miles, follow the Overlook Trail uphill to Wildwood Trail and turn right. Turn right onto Hemlock Trail (be careful crossing SW Fairview Blvd). Stay on Hemlock until a right turn onto Creek Trail, cross the road and continue down and take a right at the intersection with Wildwood. Follow Wildwood up the slope to cross back over SW Fairview Blvd, then right onto Oak Trail to return to the parking lot.
DIRECTIONS: From downtown, travel west on U.S. 26 for two miles. Take exit 72 and turn right onto SW Canyon Road, which becomes SW Knights Boulevard. Turn right on SW Fairview Boulevard. Drive about 1/8 mile to the visitor center parking lot on the right. The southern end of the arboretum can also be accessed from the Washington Park MAX Station. No fees or permits required.You might think we’re insane after you read this recipe, but just trust us here, you should try this recipe.
Unbelievable Blondies
These “blondies” contain chickpeas. Remember in our last post, Millet + Chickpea Summer Salad, when I mentioned that I had a weird craving for chickpeas? Well… let’s just say that I dove off the deep end. And the results are absolutely delicious. These “blondie” recipe is lightly adapted from Katie’s Snickerdoodle Blondie recipe over at Chocolate Covered Katie.
Ingredients
- 1 can Chickpeas, drained and rinsed
- 1/2 c. sugar
- 1/4 c. ground flax seed
- 3 TBSP Peanut Butter (or other nut butter)
- 1 TBSP Pumpkin Puree (or applesauce)
- 2 tsp. Molasses
- 1 tsp. Baking Powder
- 2.5 tsp. Cinnamon
- 1/4 c. Water (optional- use to thin out batter)
Directions
- Preheat oven to 350, grease a 8×8 pan (or a 7×11 worked in our case!)
- Put all ingredients into a food processor, blend until smooth, adding water as needed until you get a thick batter.
- Gently stir in any mix-ins such as chocolate chips, mashmallows, other candies (peanut butter cup pieces would be DELICIOUS in this!)
- Bake for 30 minutes, until “blondies” are almost finished- they’ll firm up as they cool!
If you clicked on over to Katie’s recipe, which we highly suggest you do, you’ll see that we only made a few changes from her original recipe. We didn’t have vanilla, baking soda or applesauce. We also reduced the sugar in the original recipe!
If you don’t think we’re crazy enough already, this tasted absolutely delicious straight out of the food processor. I’m pretty sure it would be a great dip for apples, pretzels or for any other dippable food.

I love the look of the blog!!Hi all,
I've posted about my kitten Harley in some other threads and there are pictures of him up too.
Anyway A quick recap.
He was a stray who showed up in my backyard in early December. He was tiny, but could eat solid food. So I estimate he was about six weeks old. I pin his birthday around the last week of October, so therefor he's around 3 months old now.
Anyway, I want to have him neutered before he goes through puberty. I want to prevent all those habits that unaltered Tom's have from even starting if I can. You know the ones. Spraying, wandering, etc. I also want to prevent more homeless, unwanted, kittens.
Harley is obviously growing bigger. Each day I see my little kitten being replaced by the big Tom Cat that's inside his DNA. So anyway, assuming that I'm about right about his age, is it too early to have him neutered? If so, when is the earliest I can have it done. Ive researched the question and gotten so many different answers. I thought this would be the best place to ask. Thanks in advance for anyone that helps answer my question.

Thanks for sharingAdvocacy, Inspiration, Leona Lo, Transgender, Transsexuals, Values
image from
When I first became an advocate for transsexual rights in 2007, Leona Lo was the one person I really looked up too. She was a lone, strong and distinct voice amongst elitist transgender groups bent on exploiting transgender issues for popularity and internal political mileage, similar to the ones we have here in Malaysia.
She was sincere and true to her wishes to share her story to highlight the plight of transwomen in South East Asia, and yet kept a reasonably low profile for all her exploits. She had a heart for the population.
Besides Saas Rogando Sasot, she was one of the best advocates in the Far East. Many times she would stand up where it was impossible for others. She opened her life so that others may be able to open theirs with less troubles.
Following her blogs, first Wo-manly and then Leona’s Blog, gave me a spark of the daily doses of possibilities in my journey as a transsexual woman. Her views on the need to differentiate cross-dressers with transsexual women, her thoughts on life and her surroundings, her incredible marathon journeys, and many other stories, served as inspiration for many like me.
I related to her in so many ways, and the first time I met her at Annexe Gallery, Central Market, KL – pure magic. There in front of me, was a true woman, without the overly-soft behaviour that is often the habit of the community, and none of the vanity botox and breast enhancements.
A transsexual woman with so much aura, she did not need to compensate it by under-dressing to exert sexiness like most transgender women do. And most distinctively in the Ah Qua Show (a stage act based on her autobiography), she performed her art without drag, while many transsexual women and gay men seem to need over-the-top make up and dressing for any performances.
A few will try begging to differ, however the fact remains; she is truly remarkable, a woman that is so far ahead of the transsexual and transgender community, trying to pull them back into society to experience the world, but for their stubbornness bred from elitism and herd mentality.
She is a natural woman. An icon of what a transsexual woman can be and can accomplish. One that has earned some place in Singaporean society, amidst the current crazy intolerance and ignorance of Singaporeans. She is my symbol. She is my heart.
Breaking her own principle, she helped me financially. She emailed me many times in my grief to never let myself fall. She soothed me in her conversations and made me feel less like a depressed retard and more of a decent human, and from that moment I realize, I am never alone. With her, I believe I can be much better than what my doubts limit me.
Later on, in a message to me in LinkedIn, she said she would like to end all future correspondences. It broke me. I cannot imagine how I feel losing her. Someone who slams passion down my throat, empowering my lungs to breathe in life.
But somehow, I knew the day was coming. Because as an advocate for a population that is too negative, hurt and buried in victim mentality, it somehow is a lost cause with little change to see for the future. Her last few blog posts before she deleted her blog indicated an intention for silence. Perhaps, I could understand.
This week, I finally learn to accept that she is gone, god knows for how long or will she be back. With that, like she told me a few years ago, it is time for us to share our own stories. I will share mine, especially to the general public, for them to see that we are much more than what society think we are. Leona Lo, wherever you are, you are one of the most beautiful women in my life. Take care.Are specialist mental health services being targeted on the most needy patients? The effects of setting up special services in general practice).
Download
Full text not available from this repository.
Description/Abstract
BACKGROUND: Around 25% of patients with psychoses lose contact with specialist psychiatric services, despite the government's policy to focus the efforts of community teams on this group.
AIM: To identify patient and practice factors associated with continuing contact and loss of contact with specialist services.
METHOD: Cross-sectional comparison was made of patients in and out of specialist contact, through detailed interviews with 102 patients among 26 south west London practices. Associations were sought between contact with specialist services and patient factors (illness severity, social functioning, quality of life, needs for care, and satisfaction with general practitioner [GP] services) and practice factors (size, location, fundholding status, training status, and the presence of mental health professionals on site).
RESULTS: Thirty-one (30%) patients were currently out of specialist contact. No significant differences were found between those in and out of contact on any measures of diagnosis or psychiatric history. Those in contact had significantly more symptoms, poorer social functioning, poorer quality of life, and more needs for care. The proportion out of contact was significantly higher in two practices that had employed their own mental health professionals to provides services on site for severe mental illnesses. Two factors remained significant predictors of contact in a logistic regression model: whether or not the patient's practice offered a special service on site, and greater patient needs for care.
CONCLUSIONS: Secondary mental health services are being targeted towards the more needy patients. The provision of special services in practices can shift care further away from secondary care while still meeting patients' needs.6 Selwyn Dr, Greenville, SC 2961537 sqft

They turned around the trains at U Street just like they turn around trains at Greenbelt (and most of the other terminal stations, including Glenmont, Vienna, Huntington, and New Carrollton).
There's a double crossover on the inbound end of the platform.
There's no explicit need for a pocket track at terminal stations because they don't have to get out of the way of through trains.

If the Columbia Pike Streetcar does well and spurs enough growth, is there really any reason we can't have the lane down Columbia Pike that we initially expected?
I could also imagine demand for one that goes through National Harbor, Alexandria, Shirlington, West/North Arlington, Georgetown and then further out in Maryland.
These are probably the most realistic for two more lines, and the only two with growing demand over the next decades.
by SilverLineHype on Jul 25, 2014 11:37 am • link • report
As for future lines, I think the Route 1 corridor is primed for BRT/light rail, which will allow increased density and TOD. Maybe even push the Yellow Line another few miles south as the first spur of development.
Agree that some type of line is needed radiating westward from the Pentagon/Pentagon City area.
I also wonder about a line, or light rail, traveling from Van Dorn area towards Tysons Corner area, eliminating the need for using Blue to reach Rosslyn.
by JDC on Jul 25, 2014 11:59 am • link • report
By adding a streetcar, the Columbia Pike corridor will never have Metrorail access. At least not within the next 50 years. In the current political climate, its nearly impossible to get funding for any rail projects, even in areas not currently served by transit. In absence of the streetcar, one could make a reasonable argument that the corridor is a great candidate for Metrorail (and I would generally agree with that argument). With the streetcar, youd be duplicating efforts in the corridor, making the multi-million dollar streetcar investment mostly worthless. Until enough time passes that people forget about the money that went into it the first time around (which will take decades), not even the smoothest talking politician in the world could sell that to the public.
by Jason on Jul 25, 2014 12:18 pm • link • report
You're right in that it will take decades, but I think it's safe to assume sometime in the life of the system if Metro is still as "valued" as it is today, there will be a Columbia Pike Metrorail line, but probably not very soon.
The glimmer of hope would be the state of Virginia's recent "support" (or lack thereof being against it) for heavy rail.
A Columbia pike line wouldn't require money from the District of Columbia which is the real area that is "lacking in the funding" for public transport in my opinion.
by SilverLineHype on Jul 25, 2014 12:26 pm • link • report
The problem with many proposed fantasy lines (including my own, natch) is that they go through areas where existing local residents and/or political leaders are unlikely to support that sort of densification.
Columbia Pike? Maybe... at least out to Bailey's. Although there is lots of 1 and 2 story construction lining it along that stretch now.
Alexandria? Not the Old Town part, certainly, although other parts could be candidates... is there political will for that, though?
National Harbor? It seems like NH wants to keep itself relatively inaccessible to the Ward 8 and PG County locals, while nearby Oxon Hill homeowners don't want much to do with the noise of NH. Doesn't seem like a great candidate, unless you literally build the station in the middle of the complex.
Route 1? Route 7 from 395 to Tysons? Other major roads? Is there any semblance of popular or political support in Fairfax County to densify those corridors? I'm dubious.

Interesting, thanks. A couple of immediate responses:
1. TOD need not have all that much office. We know demand for residential (and some commercial) TOD is high!
2. There are lots of defense/other government facilities clustered near the Route 1 corridor that make locating there attractive in a way that locating in Tysons would not be for certain firms. Or they want both locations.
3. What evidence is there that demand for TOD of any sort is anywhere near matching supply?
by Dizzy on Jul 25, 2014 3:10 pm • link • report
2. Yes. Thats one reason rte 1 in particular may be less likely to cannibalize Tysons then say denser development in McLean (outside Tysons) or Pimmit Hills, etc.
3. Of course it is not now. Thats why at best we are seeing some ambiguous signs of a plateau in rental rates, and we continue to see new projects in the pipeline across the DMV. But developing a new TOD center is a long term project, especially of course the heavy rail extensions addressed in comments above. MWCOG exepects FFX to have a 2040 pop of 1.3 million, out of a metro area pop of almost 6.8 million. thats growth of a little over 200k from current pop. Growth in Tysons Urban District alone alone should accommodate about 40% of that. Other areas with existing heavy rail stations, or new SL stations, expected to asborb TOD growth include Reston Wiehle, Reston Town Center, Herndon, Innovation, Merrifield at Dunn Loring (far from built out), Metrowest at Vienna (not quite built out) Huntington Station, and at least some at Franconia-Springfield. Additinionally there is some densification already in pipeline at Baileys, Seven Corners, Annandale, and in the Rte 1 corridor away from Huntington. There is likely to be more even without new transit infra, and probably more than that if the light rail/street car/BRT/VRE improvements now being considered are implemented.
It does not sound to me like there is enough demand to warrent new heavy rail metro stations in Fairfax County, beyond the Silver Line and possibly a short extension of the Yellow line until 2050 or so, unless either A. MWCOG has seriously underestimated the proportion of households looking for TOD or B. MWCOG has seriously underestimated the total growth of the metro area, or C. most of the jurisdictions competing with Fairfax to provide TOD (DC, MoCo, Arlington, Alexandria, City of Falls Church, City of Fairfax, and even PG and Loudoun) pretty much fail

If you create significant new amounts of transit and transit-accessible living, the number of people willing to live there will at the very least change if not soar. This region could be a pioneer. But it's all too content to drive itself to death.
by LowHeadways on Jul 25, 2014 4:27 pm • link • report
There is certainly a premium people will pay for living near "quality" transit, showing that building more will lead more to choose it. But while that premium is signficant, it is not infinite. As of noon tomorrow, several thousand units will have heavy rail transit access, as well as land where new units with room for upwards of 80,000 people are expected in the next 35 years. And new metro stations are underway at RTC, Herndon, Innovation, and two stops in Loudoun. And in about 5 years we will have a new metro station in Alexandria (the infill at Potomac Yards) and the Purple line. Even discounting the ability of mixed traffic streetcars (PikeRail and DC streetcars) and BRT (MoCo, CCPY, and in DC) to count as "quality" transit, we will have significant new areas available for TOD soon. Not to mention that we are still not fully utilizing our existing heavy rail metro stations for TOD, whether due to zoning, to inadequate pedestrian access, or the combination of issues with crime, perception of crime, schools, etc that holds back TOD in EOTR DC and in much of PG.

I am extremely interested in being a part of a tandem jump with a member of your team and would like any information i could get on it to see if i could qualify to do so. Thanks very much for your time!
I too am interested jumping out of a plane and why not do it with the best. Please let me know if this will ever be possible. My dad is in the Army. Go ARMY!!!
I would like to find out if it is possible to re-enlist on the jump plane and tandem jump.
This may be fun for some, but you wont see me jumping out of a plane!
My daughter and I enjoyed a tandem drop over Homestead, FL this past weekend. The GK team explained every detail about the jump and left nothing to question…we both felt safe and secure knowing that these young professionals had hundreds of hours of experience with tandem drops…PLUS, the GK I was with had done 5 drops with his own Mom.
Crossing the street in NYC is far more deadly than skydiving with the Golden Knights.
I would like to request the team consider a jump for Families of the Fallen in the Tampa Bay, FL area.
Want to jump, but only with the best. Would it ever be possible? We are an ARMY family.Election Day is 175 days away.
Last week, President Obama announced his support for same-sex marriage. Newsweek has since labeled Obama “The First Gay President.”
But heavy is the head that wears the crown, or more accurately, a rainbow-colored "gaylo." The New York Times.
A CBS News/New York Times poll found Mitt Romney “has a slight edge” over Obama. Indeed, the latest email from Obama for America acknowledges “this election is going to be close.”
With the new voting changes, there is no margin for error.

UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. -- Penn State's top two fullbacks are products of the father-son pipeline.
Starter Joe Suhey and backup Michael Zordich are among the 25 father-son combinations who have played for Hall of Fame coach Joe Paterno entering this season.
Suhey comes from a football family that is almost as recognizable as the Nittany Lions' mascot.
His father, Matt, was a running back who gained 2,818 yards for the Lions from 1976-79. He spent 10 years in the NFL with the Chicago Bears, where he earned a Super Bowl ring in 1985 while serving as the lead blocker for Hall of Famer Walter Payton.
Suhey's great-grandfather, Bob Higgins, was Penn State's second All-American and served as head coach from 1930-48. His grandfather, Steve Suhey, was a three-year letterman at guard who earned All-American honors as a senior in 1947.
Two uncles, Larry and Paul, played for the Lions in the 1970s and a first cousin, Kevin, was a backup quarterback and special teams player from 2005-07. Suhey's mother, Donna, also is a Penn State graduate.
On top of that, when Paterno came to Penn State as an assistant to Rip Engle in 1950, he rented a bedroom in the Suhey house.
"I don't know all of the details and all of the connections, but it's really been neat to not only follow my dad to Penn State, but to play for the same coach he did," Joe Suhey said. "It is extremely unusual, but very interesting.
"Every now and then, we'll compare notes about Joe's intensity and his toughness. Not a whole lot has changed over the years."
Zordich's dad, Mike, was an All-American strong safety who played for Penn State from 1982-85. He spent 12 seasons in the NFL with the New York Jets, Phoenix Cardinals and Philadelphia Eagles and now is a defensive quality control coach for the Eagles.
Zordich's mom, Cynthia, was a Penn State cheerleader.
"I guess you could say my family bleeds blue and white," the younger Zordich said.
Suhey, 6 feet 1 and 227 pounds, is a redshirt junior. Zordich, 6-1, 236, is a redshirt sophomore.
Suhey was a standout high school football player at Loyola Academy in Illinois, where he also played basketball with Michael Jordan's two sons, Jeff and Marcus.
After redshirting as a freshman at Penn State, Suhey participated in 172 snaps in 2008 on offense and special teams. He started two games last year and played a season-high 44 snaps against LSU in the Capital One Bowl.
He finished the season with 22 carries for 68 yards. He added 21 receptions for 186 yards and one touchdown.
"I am a pretty low-key guy," Suhey said. "I try to stay under the radar. I just try to come to practice and work hard every day and do what the coaches want."
Zordich, who helped lead Cardinal Mooney High School in Youngstown, Ohio, to three consecutive Ohio Class IV state championship games, has made more of a name for himself off the field than on it.
He was charged with driving under the influence of alcohol and underage drinking last August following an incident at 3:25 a.m. on campus after university police saw him driving without his headlights on. Zordich's blood-alcohol content was .19, more than twice the state's legal limit of .08.
In April, he was cited for underage drinking again after police reported seeing him lose his balance and stumble into the front of an officer's vehicle.
Zordich, who moved from linebacker to fullback last season, when he recorded three tackles and two kickoff returns for 28 yards while playing 55 snaps, said he feels fortunate to still be on the team.
"I absolutely thought I might be gone," he said. "I messed up. And it was my fault. It was on me. I am very, very thankful that coach Paterno let me back on the team and let me have another shot at it.
"My dad, he was upset with me, too. He expected more out of me and I expected more. It was a mistake that I made that I've got to live with."

I haven’t yet figured out or gotten to the point where I’m eating 100% healthy because it makes me feel good vs eating 100% healthy because its what I’m suppose to do. Does that make sense?
I really want to get to MizFit so I’m going to table this topic but will expand on it tomorrow ok?

One would hope that when possible, apparel paid for by taxpayer dollars should be 100% “Made in the USA.” And if you read this blog regularly, you’ll know that there is always an opportunity to take action by signing a virtual petition, or sending an email or making a phone call. Here it is.
U.S. Congressman Sherrod Brown has introduced the Wear American Act. Tell Congress today — if the government is buying it, it should be Made in America!
Before you click the link above to help make a wrong thing right … There’s something else bothering me. Think about all the money we borrow, and owe, China. Doesn’t it feel really weird to borrow money from China, outsource our manufacturing jobs to China and then the government purchases the goods made in China from outsourcing our jobs? Huff Post’s Allan Uke wrote a great article yesterday wherein he said, “over 60% of manufactured goods sold in this country are now made abroad.” We’re giving our jobs away.
There’s an ancient proverb that says, roughly, the lion is king of beasts and the mightiest of all other animals. What will kill the lion is the parasite in its bowels. This is something Mitt Romney and others who made, and continue to make, massive fortunes by outsourcing American jobs to China and other countries should think long and hard about. We have passed the halfway mark, what with 60 percent of goods sold here are made abroad. If we continue to do this, we will kill our economy and destroy the American dream.
And while Romney and the GOP spend millions on false ads and strange accusations that have no basis in reality, let alone facts, we cannot afford to be distracted by their weirdness. We need to ask whether Mitt Romney’s assets are tied up in any way to the Olympic team uniforms having been outsourced to China in the first place and then purchased in the US. Is Romney making money from that deal? He outsourced the torch-bearer uniforms to Burma, of all places, when he headed up the 2002 Olympics in Salt Lake.
It’s not a stretch to question whether a Bain company was or is involved in outsourcing the team uniforms and Romney benefiting from same. Remember the Sensata Technologies story wherein Romney owns 51 percent of the company through Bain and may stand to make money off of the Sensata plant closing in Freeport Ill by outsourcing the remaining jobs (to China)?
Maybe it is and maybe it isn’t. We won’t know without looking closely at Romney’s financial records like his tax returns, namely, the ones he refuses to show us.
As I’ve said before, Mitt Romney isn’t presidential material. His brand of economics is investing in BPO, business process outsourcing; a concept that has helped to propel China’s economy to become the largest in the world, as well as other countries. That’s great for China and those other countries, and great for Mitt Romney, but what about the rest of us?

i think obama is president and the buck was spent by him not romney. how can you say romney is the bad guy, its the current president who is sending jobs overseas, the current president is the one that allows the out sourcing. obama could have done many things to brings jobs back he did not. romney only played by the rules the current president allows…
Thanks for the response, John. I don’t say anything I can’t back up with hard cold facts. I strongly urge you to look at the facts. At no time has President Obama sent American jobs overseas to any country. That’s simply not true and there is fact to back that up. In stark contrast, there is a boat load of facts that clearly show without a shadow of doubt that Mitt Romney not only sent thousands of jobs overseas; that’s his expertise and that’s how he’s made millions.
What’s more, it’s still happening.
Forget who’s in which political party. Look at the facts. Romney just isn’t presidential material. His leadership revolves around making money at the expense of others. And when he talks about foreign matters, he’s ready to spend more money and send our precious men and women in union into more wars. Coming from a family with over a century in military service, I’ve had enough of war.As far as flavor, I brought this one to a potluck, and one of the comments was that it was so good, it didn't need butter..
Dressed-Up White Bread
2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1/2 cup (2 1/2 ounces) semolina flour
1/2 cup quick cooking rolled oats
2 cups (9 ounces) bread flour
1 large egg
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
1 tablespoon olive oil
In the bowl of your stand mixer, combine water, yeast, and sugar. Stir to combine and set aside for 10 minutes until it is frothy.
Add the semolina and oatmeal, stir to combine, and set aside for another 10 minutes, until the oatmeal softens and the mixture is bubbly.
Add the bread flour and the egg, and knead with the dough hook until the mixture begins to get elastic.
Add the salt and the olive oil and continue kneading until the mixture is smooth, elastic, and no longer sticky. There may be some nubby lumps from the oatmeal, but the dough itself should be smooth and stretchy.
Form the dough into a ball and put it back into the mixer bowl (or a clean bowl, if you prefer) drizzle it with a bit of olive oil, and cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Set it aside to rise until doubled, about an hour.
Preheat your oven to 350 degrees and sprinkle some cornmeal on a sheet pan. Sprinkle some flour on your work surface. Take the dough out of the bowl, knead it a bit, and form it into a smooth, tight ball. Place it on your sheet pan, seam-side down. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside until doubled, about 30 minutes.
With a small, sharp pair of scissors, starting at the top of the loaf, make a series of snips around the loaf. You can make as many as you like, make them as large or small as you like, in any pattern.
I made rows of concentric circles around the loaf, but you could do lines down the loaf, or a spiral pattern.
Bake at 350 degrees for about 40 minutes, until the loaf is golden brown.
Cool completely on a wire rack before slicing.

Forum RulesI've got two blogs here that I write on regularly. One of them, I can access the dashboard fine. The other one, my main one, I can't access due to maintenance. What's weird is:
1) I saw nothing about maintenance recently
2) When I first tried to access this blog, it said my dashboard would be unavailable for 5 minutes or so. Now whenever I reload the page, the time appears to be going UP. It's not saying my dashboard won't be available for the next 23 minutes.
What's up?
edit: make that 24 minutes.. argh.The ability to maintain the “big picture” while completing individual, discrete tasks is one of the most critical aspects of working in the aviation environment. Preoccupation with one particular task can degrade the ability to detect other important information.
This month’s CALLBACK looks at examples of how fixation adversely affects overall task management.
A Repack Comes Back
By fixating on one aspect of a multi-part job, this Maintenance Technician missed a key factor in re-assembling a B767 landing gear.
■ I was assigned the task of a B767 main landing gear repack…. I removed the lower truck assembly, removed all parts and began assembly…. I assembled the lower gland nut, lower seal carrier, spacer, snubber and upper bearing. The upper bearing can be assembled about five different ways. It is not “Murphy-proof.” The Aircraft Maintenance Manual says to check for proper orientation and this is where I made the mistake. I was fixated on the orientation (installed either upside down or right side up) and not the proper placement of the upper bearing. I continued on and finished the repack and I signed the paperwork off.
Enroute to destination, the crew discovered the right-hand main landing gear would not come out of the wheel well. They declared an emergency and through extreme maneuvers were able to free the gear and land safely.
I was called out to fly to the aircraft location to perform another strut repack and found we had assembled the upper bearing incorrectly…. The strut over-extended by 7/8 inch and got caught in the wheel well.
On the Button, Off the Course
Too much attention to an autopilot issue detracted from this General Aviation pilot’s navigation duties and resulted in a frightening lesson.
■ … I meant to set 2,800 feet as my minimum altitude to insure avoiding the…Class D ceiling (2,600 feet). I mistakenly set 1,800 feet. It wouldn’t have mattered if I were paying proper attention since I didn’t intend to fly that close to the Class D airspace.
I was head down in the cockpit trying to figure out why a button pushing sequence was not working per the autopilot manual. At some point I realized that I was taking too long over this. When I turned westward I noticed that I was almost over [the] airport at 1,800 feet. [There were] sky divers above and to the north as low as about 2,300 feet and perhaps a half-mile [distant].
This is the most frightening thing that’s ever happened to me in flying. The airspace incursion was the least of it. Had [the direction of] my turn been different, I could have been among the divers with potentially catastrophic results.
The cause is obvious – task fixation and a resulting lack of situational awareness that resulted in being where I shouldn’t be and not establishing [radio] contact for any potential warning of the skydiving activity.
It’s not so much that [my] priorities need reordering, it’s actually making my behavior match my mental priorities. Not as easy, but a scare like this is a very effective incentive.
Tunnel Vision
By fixating on one portion of a traffic conflict, this Air Traffic Controller was late in recognizing that there was more traffic “outside the tunnel.”
Distracted Driver
Intent on locating hazardous debris on a runway at night, a Ramp Vehicle Operator inadvertently crossed an active runway.
■ ...On duty as Ramp One, I received a call from Tower [regarding] possible debris on Runway 9L due to a tire blowout.... Tower cleared me to inspect Runway 9L and directed me to hold short of intersecting Runway 13.... I proceeded onto Runway 9L westbound doing a shallow “S” pattern to cover as much area as possible.... [During] the inspection Tower advised that I had crossed Runway 13….
Later I spoke to the Tower supervisor to confirm that an unauthorized movement across an active runway had indeed transpired. I fixated on accomplishing my task and tunnel vision caused me to miss the intersecting runway....
Unsafe Lane Change
Defensive driving involves awareness of all potential traffic conflicts, not just those in front of one’s vehicle. This crew of an air carrier jet fixated on traffic ahead and got a surprise from the side.
■ We were going to [the gate] and... our traffic was a 757 southbound in the left lane moving [toward] us with his taxi light on.... Additionally, there was a westbound baggage cart stopping on the mid-crossroad…. I was focused, more like fixated, on the 757 coming at us and making sure that the westbound baggage cart stopped before crossing in front of us. The First Officer, I believe, was fixated on the westbound baggage cart. I turned the aircraft to make the transition from the left lane to the right lane… when Ramp Control said, “[Air Carrier XXX], Stop!” I stopped the aircraft immediately and then leaned forward and saw [an aircraft] pushing off a gate into the right lane. I did not see the MD-80 because of my fixation on the 757 and the baggage cart…. Needless to say, I was pretty upset about not seeing the other aircraft and the collision potential!
Technically Advanced Violation
Advanced navigation equipment can provide a wealth of readily available information, but as this Cirrus SR20 pilot learned, sometimes too much information can be a distraction.
■ I was receiving transition training and [we were]… in cruise with Flight Following services from ATC. We requested permission to transition the Class D airspace at our cruising altitude of 2,500 feet MSL. We then went back to looking at information about our next destination, some 15 miles away, on the MFD (Multi-Function Display) screen. Since we were on the airport detail page, we were not monitoring our position on the map page. Switching back to the map page we realized that we were…in the airspace around [the airport]. Shortly, ATC responded to our request with a denial of clearance into the Class D airspace.
I can now add my name to the list of those who advise against getting fixated on the capabilities and “interesting things to look at” on TAA (Technically Advanced Aircraft) displays... While they are a fantastic benefit for situational awareness, the information they provide must still be monitored wisely by the pilot….
The U.S. Coast Guard’s Team Coordination Training Guide defines Situational Awareness as “the ability to identify, process, and comprehend critical elements of information about what is happening.... Simply put, it is knowing what is going on around you....” In addition to fixation, there are a number of other human factors that can adversely affect our ability to know and efficiently process “what is going on around” us. In upcoming issues of CALLBACK, reporters to ASRS will share their insights on such factors as complacency, overload, confusion, fatigue and distraction.

For New Pornographers print, I ordered a "German silver" frame to fit the print without mats. It turned out pretty sweet. The German silver matches the suits!
For the The Decemberists poster, I wanted a mat and went through the color options online, ultimately selecting a yellow mat that I was pretty sure would look awesome (I grabbed some yellow fabric from my stash and held it up to the poster and saw that it would *work*!) But...um...I didn't read closely and when the kits arrived, I discovered that what I thought was yellow was actually gold. Totes my fault, by the way, it is called "Golden Nugget" and I do know that metallic rarely show as metallic on the Internet.
There was no way I was going to put a gold mat in a silver frame. No freakin' way.
One friend suggested that I spray paint the frame.
Which led me to thinking about painting the mat.
Which led me to buying some paint.
And painting...
It came out a bit greener than I intended, but I think it works and it'll be easy enough to reopen the frame and paint again if I decide that's got to happen. I think I've decided to paint my home office gray, not green, so I'll wait for that paint to go up before making a final call.
The whole episode with the hilariously metallic mat reminded me of discharging and dying fabric, which began, of course, when I ordered some pink fabric online and it turned out to be PINK. Sometimes the answer is to whine a bit and then get some supplies and mess around!
I think this is a perfect example of why it is better to shop local. Keeps the jobs in your neighborhood and you would have been sure to get exactly what you want. With the couple extra bucks it would have cost you to shop local, it would have equaled the cost of your time to fix it.
Thanks so much for sharing the link to that frame shop! Ever since the absolute impossibility of trying to find a frame for my husband's irregularly sized Butch Cassidy poster, I've completely shyed away from purchasing any art in non-standard dimensions. The custom frame options we looked into were way not worth it, but this site looks pretty darn reasonable. Problem solved!
Heather: it is a nice sentiment, but innaccurate about the $ difference. I paid $50 total for the kits, the price for them at the "local" shop (it is a chain) is several times that--well over $150.
also, to me, overpaying for frames from an international chain that happens to have a location in town where they underpay workers is not ethically superior to buying frames at a good price from an American company online. when there was an indie shop in town, i took my business there.
The art is original and purchased directly from the artists, which matters more, in my opinion.
YAY! Another screen print fan :) I love it too and it led me to meet my future hubby and now we do screen printing in our basement together for work (15 years independent).
Both posters you chose are beautiful! love the blends in the Decemberists poster ~ and the mat you painted turned out great! Curious to see what else you had stored away in that closet...
They both look awesome! Great job!
I'm so firmly entrenched in quilting, and that's why I love your blog. You do such interesting "other" stuff - and you make me think. A good thing...
I can't say as I've ever heard of either of those bands, but I would totally have the Decemberists poster hanging on my wall, especially with the painted mat that you put with it. Just makes the poster "pop". Makes me wish even more that we lived in our own home so that we could put up whatever posters/framed art that we wanted, where we wanted. But oh well, I will wait a while longer... But then, watch out walls...
Love the bands (especially New Pornographers-my favorite album is Challengers, but I don't have Mass Romantic-thanks for the suggestion!) and love your new artwork.
Thanks for sharing the frame link. And your posters look great. That Decemberists one is especially sharp!
Oh I love them! Frames and mat goes perfect. Good choice in music too!HALIFAX – The majority of people who offered opinions for a report on hydraulic fracturing in Nova Scotia say they want the province to ban or maintain a moratorium on the disputed industry.
There were 238 individual submissions to an expert panel that’s looking at the environmental impact of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, in Nova Scotia.
Of those, 92 per cent said they supported a moratorium or ban, while 0.5 per cent were against such prohibitions.
The discussion paper will form the basis of a chapter in a report to be produced later this year by the independent panel.
The most common concern for respondents was the effect fracking could have on water resources, followed by perceived risks to infrastructure and local industries, such as farming and forestry.
Jennifer West of the Ecology Action Centre in Halifax says she was pleased the paper recommended government take a precautionary approach, consult the public and do more research on fracking.
© The Canadian Press, 2014§ Mr. Speaker
Before I call the Foreign Secretary, I must announce that a great many right hon. and hon. Members wish to participate in the debate. There is to be another debate next Friday on Eastern Europe. May I suggest that right hon. and hon. Members who want to direct their remarks specifically to eastern Europe might reserve their speeches until next week. I shall find it difficult to call the same hon. Members in both debates.
Today, I propose to put a limit of 10 minutes on speeches made between 11.30 am and 1 pm, but I hope that hon. Members who are called before and after those times—including Privy Councillors—will bear that in mind.
§ Mr. Dick Douglas (Dunfermline, West)
On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. We heard your remarks, and some of us watched a little of an interview you gave on television, in which you said that, in some cases, an intervention by a Back Bencher is equivalent to a 10-minute speech. Members of the Government are clearly identified and do not live in a state of suspended animation, flitting between the Front and Back Benches, making speeches from each. The same is not true of this side of the House. How will you identify genuine Opposition Back Benchers to ensure that we are not crowded out by so-called Front Benchers speaking from the Back Benches?
§ Mr. Speaker
I do not recall saying that in this context. Although I do not recollect saying that in the context of a debate, I may have said that a well-directed intervention can be more effective than a rather long speech. I hope that there will not be too many interventions today, because it is a timed debate.
§ The Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (Mr. Douglas Hurd)
Two days ago, the brutal assassination of the new, legitimately elected president of Lebanon shocked the world. We condemn this murder, which has caused a bitter setback to the process of reconciliation in Lebanon. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister has sent our condolences to the Lebanese Prime 346 Minister. In Lebanon, hope has suffered a severe blow, but in eastern Europe it rules the scene, for there, a peaceful and profound revolution is under way.
In the west of Europe, the steady strengthening of the European Community continues. Meanwhile, in Hong Kong, we wrestle with a network of complicated problems. Of course, other important issues confront us—in the middle east, South Africa, Cambodia and elsewhere. We are meeting them with our allies and partners in NATO, the Community and the Commonwealth. The House will have opportunities to discuss those issues. Right hon. and hon. Members will, of course, want to speak about some of them in this debate, and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence will try to reply to as many of the issues that are raised as he can when he winds up the debate, but I hope that the House will understand if I concentrate on the three areas I have mentioned, as they are of central interest.
In 1989, we have experienced upheavals on our continent which have been unparalleled in peace time since 1848, which also was a year of revolutions driven by a desire for political liberty and national self-expression. For the most part, however, the revolutions of 1848 ended in violence and disappointment. In 1989, as this astonishing pace of change continues, we have begun to hope that it may prove to be lasting. There may, of course, be halts and reverses, but it would be hard now to re-create the iron curtain.
Europe has had 40 years of stability east and west of the iron curtain, but stability has been assured in very different ways. In the West we have achieved and held stability after the most destructive convulsion in our history through free political institutions. Internally, we have relied on democracy; externally, we have built up international institutions freely entered into to draw our democracies closer together. I refer to NATO for our defence, the European Community to strengthen our prosperity, based on free enterprise, and the Council of Europe to bind us in willing affirmation of these shared values of democracy.
The East has also had stability, but based on enforced uniformity and regimes imposed from the outside. It has been stability based on denying freedom and on one party having a monopoly of power. In the last resort, as we witnessed in the bloodshed of 1953, 1956 and 1968, that stability was based on the readiness of the Soviet Union to employ ruthless force to maintain its nominees in power. The tanks fired in those three years, and the people were forced back into the shadows.
Those systems of coercion are now crumbling fast. It is not hard to understand why. They lacked the basic foundation of consent by the governed. Metternich, who in 1848 symbolised the old regime, understood the appeal of freedom. He once said:It is useless to close the gates against ideas. They overleap them.For gates, iron curtains and Berlin walls, that is what is happening. In 1989, the idea of freedom is leaping over them all.
I am sure that the whole House welcomes those changes, and we salute the courage and wisdom of those who are using peaceful protest to break down the barriers which separated them from freedom. But it is only the beginning of a long and difficult transformation for the countries concerned.
What should our response be? We, by which I mean the Government, our partners and our allies, are working out 347 and have expressed a careful and clear response. It was worked out in close consultation with our partners at the EC summit last weekend in Paris which I attended with my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister. To those of us who believe in the European Community, it was heartening to find the heads of state and Government, not to mention the Foreign Ministers, so clearly united on a response to these events.
We reached the following conclusions. First, we must do everything we can to encourage the process of political and economic reform in eastern Europe. We discussed the practical forms which such support should take in three main areas. We agreed that aid to Poland and Hungary should be stepped up and that the West should be ready to make a further generous response once the International Monetary Fund agreements now being negotiated are in place. The House knows that Britain has already established know-how funds for Poland and Hungary to help provide the skills needed to run a democratic system and a market-based economy. We have contributed to Community food aid to Poland worth £70 million and project aid to Poland and Hungary now worth three times as much.
In trade, we agreed that we should aim to build on the wide-ranging trade and co-operation agreements that we already have with Poland and Hungary. Quota arrangements for those countries are already under review and we shall go through that again at the Foreign Affairs Council next Monday. We also agreed to consider the scope for the best way to work out new forms of association between the Community and those reforming countries, suited to the needs of each. There will have to be further detailed work on that in the Community in the coming weeks.
Economic assistance and co-operation can help to ease the strains of transition to more market-based economies hut, with our partners, we believe that a third way to encourage reform is to invite the reformers into the Council of Europe, which at present unites 23 western European countries in a common commitment to democracy and human rights. In principle, membership of the Council of Europe is open, as many hon. Members know, to any democratic European country ready to ratify the European convention on human rights. We believe that the Council should be and is ready to accept east European countries as members once they are able to meet those conditions.
The second main conclusion that we reached in Paris concerned the importance of keeping stability and security in Europe. We all recognise that a time of change is also a time of uncertainty. Neither West nor East should feel that its fundamental security interests are threatened by peaceful change. That is why it has been agreed that it is important to send a clear message of reassurance to the Soviet Union that the West does not intend to seek to use recent events to prejudice Soviet security. For our part, we shall continue to look to NATO as a strong and reliable defence.
§ Mr. Denis Healey (Leeds, East)
Given the undertaking that was the result of the summit last weekend, will Her Majesty's Government now abandon the idea of replacing the Lance missile with another nuclear missile with twice the range, especially as both Lord Carrington and Mr. Genscher, the Foreign Minister of West Germany, have said that it is inconceivable and laughable?
§ Mr. Hurd
The right hon. Gentleman, who follows these matters with intimate care, knows that the answer to his question was worked out by the allies earlier this year. Modernisation is not being pressed at present, because it has been agreed that the first priority should be to reach agreement at the negotiations on conventional armed forces in Europe—the CFE talks—at Vienna, and after that to consider how negotiations with the Soviet Union on short-range nuclear missiles should be conducted. Only after that, and in consideration of the circumstances at that stage, would the Alliance consider whether modernisation was necessary. That is the comprehensive concept that was worked out earlier in the year, and it seems to be entirely the present position.
To a large extent, it is Mr. Gorbachev's policies in the Soviet Union that have made possible the changes in eastern Europe. He has had the courage and clarity of vision to see the writing on the iron curtain, and to accept and even to encourage change. It is emphatically in the western interest that Soviet policies, which have contributed so much to improved East-West relations and to reform in eastern Europe, should be sustained. That is also in the long-term interests of the Soviet people. We shall therefore continue to give Mr. Gorbachev support and encouragement.
I believe that it has emerged already that the Community approach that I have summarised coincides with that of the United States. The forthcoming United States-Soviet summit provides a timely opportunity for President Bush to convey western views to President Gorbachev, and to explore the prospects for East-West relations as a whole. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister is today meeting President Bush to discuss these and other matters.
On 4 December, President Bush will brief NATO leaders in Brussels on the results of his talks with President Gorbachev. We hope that the summit will provide additional impetus towards further measures of arms control, and especially to the successful conclusion of the Vienna CFE talks next year. There is reason to hope that this goal of agreement next year—it will be a substantial agreement—can be reached. We are playing a full and constructive part in the negotiations. An agreement at Vienna will mean the elimination of the massive conventional superiority and offensive capacity of Warsaw Pact forces in Europe. Numbers of tanks and artillery in Europe will be cut by half if the agreement is reached. Parity in United States and Soviet manpower stationed in Europe at 275,000 a side will mean a cut of over 50 per cent. in Soviet forces. Reductions of this size will transform the military security situation in Europe arid bring greater stability when it will be most needed, at a time of great change.
I have spoken of the ways in which the European Community intends to encourage peaceful change in eastern Europe. There is no doubt, as has been said frequently in recent days, that the Community is a strong magnet for our eastern neighbours. Of course the Community has its arguments; it has always proceeded in that way. Despite the arguments, however, it remains an outstanding example—perhaps this is because of the arguments to some extent—of the way in which free nations working together can co-operate to bring about a different sort of revolution. The Government believe that opening the Community to the East is entirely consistent with continuing to strengthen the ties between Community 349 partners. As the House debated progress in this area last week, I do not want to go over the ground in more detail again. As there is a great swirl of discussion and debate on these matters, I shall state a few clear facts—facts which will remain when the headlines of yesterday are waste paper.
First, the European Community lies at the heart of our foreign policy, of our trading policy and of our concept of our place in Europe and beyond. The meeting in Paris last week showed again that the Community is far more than a free trade area. It provides a framework and meeting place for the member states to reach quickly and naturally, as happened in Paris, a common view on the course for Europe. Depite all the arguments, the habit of working together is now firmly established.
Secondly, the Community cannot be static. It is strong precisely because it has continued steadily to evolve. Thirdly, it is in the Community's own interest to move forward in an orderly way. Nothing is gained by forcing the pace. For example, we do not believe that in the near future the Community is likely to receive new full members. We are not attracted by the notion that we should in some way dilute the strength of the Community by enlarging it. There is a heavy work load for the existing members. There is a great deal to do, and we want to concentrate on that.
We wish success for the negotiations that are going on for a new relationship between our Community and EFTA. To be precise, the negotiations are being prepared. We expect that the formal negotiations will begin next year. The EC-EFTA negotiations are important in their own right, and we shall do our best for their success. They have nothing to do with the United Kingdom's position firmly in the Community.
§ Mr. Nigel Spearing (Newham, South)
Does the Foreign Secretary agree that, whatever the direction of the EEC may be—there may be differences of opinion about that—its inherent characteristics would not allow some of the eastern European nations, which we hope will emerge as democracies, to associate themselves with policies which were applied by Mr. Attlee as he then was, during 1945–50? Those policies were pursued when Britain was an emerging democracy and economy after the war. It would not be possible now for the United Kingdom or for the countries of eastern Europe to take such a course. Is there not a danger that this will create between the EEC and eastern European countries a difference of economic and political philosophies that will not be good for the future peace and tranquillity of Europe?
§ Mr. Hurd
It is perfectly true, as the hon. Gentleman knows, that the treaty of Rome and the characteristics of the Community rule out, for example, import restrictions, massive state aids to industry and some of the other excitements practised in Britain during the period to which the hon. Gentleman referred. These actions are excluded. That is one reason for my thinking that, for the forseeable future, Poland, Hungary and other eastern European states, as they move towards democracy, will not be able to become, or to aim at being, full members of the Community. That is why we should work out tailormade 350 and specific European agreements that gradually increase in content, perhaps, with such countries as they join, as it were, the European democratic ranks.
It is agreed by all member states that our first and foremost priority is to complete the single market. Everyone believes within the Community that that is an indispensable stage in Europe's development. There is progress, but we believe that it is too slow.
The Spanish presidency saw approval of a record number of measures removing barriers to trade in the Community. At the Madrid summit, which took place in the summer, Community leaders agreed new single market priorities, including financial services, technical standards, transport and public purchasing. Progress with some of these has so far been sluggish. There remains plenty to be done, and Britain will continue to urge that the pace that the Community has set in building Europe in this respect should be maintained and accelerated. We are in the fast track, urging others on.
Britain remains committed to the progressive realisation of economic and monetary union in the Community. We are strong supporters of the first phase as set out in stage one of the Delors plan. That envisages action by all member states to free their financial markets and to abolish exchange controls, as Britain has already done. As part of stage one, we have undertaken to join the exchange rate mechanism—about which we hear from time to time—and we have reaffirmed that undertaking more than once. The conditions that we have said must first be fulfilled are realistic, prudent and sustainable.
I noticed on Tuesday that the Leader of the Opposition got into a terribly sticky mess when he tried to define his conditions. I listened carefully through the gathering noise as he tried to find his way out of that sticky mess, but the more that he tried to explain, the more it appeared that his conditions—shorn of the rhetoric—were remarkably similar to the Government's.
§ Mr. Paul Boateng (Brent, South)
Listening to the Foreign Secretary, one wishes that the Prime Minister went away rather more often, because the right hon. Gentleman appears to have found a new and welcome boldness. When he talks about eastern Europe and the Common Market, will he reflect on the fact that it is now the established practice in eastern Europe for senior members of a ruling party in difficulty, when faced with an aging and intransigent ruler, to go to that ruler and persuade him, in the interests of the party and the country, to resign? Does the right hon. Gentleman favour that practice, and why does he not emulate it?
§ Mrs. Gwyneth Dunwoody (Crewe and Nantwich)
If we are indeed in the fast track in Europe, does the right hon. Gentleman support the contention that there should be a rapid move towards a two-tier system in Europe, and what is his intention for such a new treaty of Europe?
§ Mr. Hurd
The hon. Lady has obviously been preparing her intervention rather than listening to my speech. I have moved beyond that point. Perhaps the hon. Lady is referring to Mr. Andriessen's remarks yesterday, which came out of discussions with the EFTA countries, but they have nothing to do with Britain's full membership of the Community. I shall return to the general point in a moment. I have been sketching what has been agreed 351 within the Community and the background that has created the position in which Britain is actually among the leaders in carrying out what has been agreed. That is a crucial point.
We are working to complete the single market. There is always a temptation for Community enthusiasts to flit from one flower to another in the rich meadows of Brussels—[Interruption.] I am not sure that the hon. Lady has shared that temptation. Nevertheless, there has always been a temptation to propose a new charter, a new conference, a new treaty amendment and so on. All that can be intoxicating stuff. The Government prefer a more sober approach. It makes sense to move forward in stages, founding each move on the practical impact of the last move on the actual life and work in the Community. That is why we are setting the pace in pressing for new measures, which have already been agreed, to be implemented. We are in the fast track in performing what we have promised.
Of the 68 single market measures now supposed to be in operation across the Community, Britain has three still to implement. That compares with nine in France—the next best performer—through to Italy, with 33 measures not implemented. Last year, the European Court of Justice did not record a single case against Britain for alleged breach of the treaty, but that was not the case for our major partners. Our state aids to industry are among the lowest in the Community, while some of our partners still lag quite badly behind us in tackling protectionism and liberalising markets.
In all those areas, Britain, the so-called reluctant European, is the Commission's ally in speeding up the pace. Let us by all means accelerate the Community's development and intensify our co-operation, but the test of that is performance—actions, not declarations. I do not think that our eastern neighbours or our own citizens would be much impressed by a Community of communiqués. Most of our partners, and certainly the Commission—
§ Mr. Gerald Kaufman (Manchester, Gorton)
What about a Community of press briefings by Mr. Ingham? Would that be better?
§ Mr. Hurd
Most of our—[Interruption] Despite the occasional trivialities tossed from the Opposition Benches, I am trying to pursue a considered sequence of arguments.
Most of our partners, and certainly the Commission—perhaps even the Opposition, if they took the time to listen to and think about these matters—would accept what I have said so far. Our partners and the Commission suggest that, in addition to implementing what has already been agreed, the Community should look further ahead. By all means let us do so, provided that we concentrate on implementing what we have already agreed. Let there be a full discussion of the steps beyond that. We are not afraid of such discussions, but let us not prejudice them before they begin.
Stages 2 and 3 of the Delors plan on economic and monetary union prescribe solutions that we do not regard as the best way to achieve agreed Community objectives. Those stages include centralising and bureaucratic tendencies. The questions about political accountability and institutional change are matters of concern not only for the Government, but for the whole House. That was evident from the thrust of our debate on 2 November, when it clearly emerged that no substantial group— 352 certainly not on the Opposition Benches and not the right hon. Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Dr. Owen}—believed that stages 2 and 3 are the right way ahead for the Community. Those reservations have been echoed by others, especially the president of the Bundesbank. The Delors plan offers one way forward. We have suggested a practical, evolutionary alternative that would work with the grain of a free economic system.
We are innocent of the charge of being half-hearted Europeans, but we plead guilty to the charge of working for a liberal and open Europe. That is not a crime; it is a necessity. We look forward to a full discussion of the options, including at the Strasbourg Council next month. The presidency has suggested that the Council should consider the content and timing of a possible intergovernmental conference, primarily to address economic and monetary union. The Madrid summit concluded that any such conference would need full and adequate preparation, and that remains our strong view.
The differences within the Community are often over-dramatised. The Community is robust enough to survive such disagreements. After all, it has always thrived on argument. Each member state has important interests at stake. Everything we agree must be implemented, at home and in every other Community country. Our responsibility to this House and to the country as a whole requires us to subject every proposal to rigorous scrutiny, just as we do for purely domestic measures.
The history of the Community is one of agreement reached after often prolonged and lively discussion. The Community is often described as being in crisis, but when the smoke clears from each argument, the Community has not only survived, but has moved forward. The pessimists have invariably under-estimated the Community's resilience, the determination of its members to work together and the ability to find answers that each national Parliament can endorse.
Britain is the country pushing forward the single market programme, which is the most tangible expression of Community ideals. We are scrupulous in implementing what has been agreed. We are urging the Community to think carefully about the form of its future development. We are playing in the centre of the field, and we intend to hold that position.
§ Sir Eldon Griffiths (Bury St. Edmunds)
I agree that the Community must be the centrepiece of our defence and foreign policies, but as my right hon. Friend looks to a broader constellation in Europe that reaches towards the East, will he make it clear that it is no part of Britain's interest that it should be a single European home that reaches to the Urals but excludes the United States?
§ Mr. Hurd
My hon. Friend goes a little further than I did, because I did not state that the Community is the core of our defence policy, precisely for the reason that he mentioned at the end of his intervention. Our defence policy and the existence of the North Atlantic Alliance is based on partnerships with the United States. The American presence in Europe will, as the American President said in his Thanksgiving day address, remain as an essential element in our own stability.
I turn to China and to Hong Kong. I shall not add to what has been said already in this House about the events in Tiananmen square last June, except to say that I felt great personal sadness at what happened. As a young 353 diplomat, for two happy years I lived a few hundred yards from the Gate of Heavenly Peace, and ever since I have felt strongly the fascination of China and of its people. At the same time—some 35 years ago—I came to know Hong Kong. I fully realise that it has transformed itself several times since then, but I know of no other place in the world that has the same mixture of glitter, hard work and adaptability.
There is no doubt that confidence in Hong Kong suffered a heavy blow in June, and we look to the Chinese authorities to co-operate fully with us in restoring it. We are doing what we can to provide the people of Hong Kong with the reassurance that they seek, and I shall give the details in a moment. Alongside their concerns for the future, the people of Hong Kong face an urgent and growing problem in the present. Here, too, they look to Britain for assistance and support. I refer to the presence in Hong Kong of almost 57,000 Vietnamese boat people, which is placing an unacceptable strain on Hong Kong's patience and resources.
Some argue that all those who arrive in Hong Kong by boat must by that fact alone be refugees entitled to settlement in the West, but that argument ignores the reality of the situation. The nature of the outflow from Vietnam has changed in recent years. Most of those now arriving in Hong Kong by boat are farmers and fishermen from North Vietnam in search of a better life. They have no connection with the former South Vietnamese regime or with the United States, and in most cases have no particular reason to fear political persecution. They are not refugees by the criteria established in the 1951 United Nations convention, and western countries have for that reason shown increasing reluctance to accept them for resettlement.
That is why, at the Geneva conference in June, the international community decided that all new arrivals in Hong Kong should go through a screening process, to determine whether or not they are refugees. There were commitments to resettle all those found to be refugees, including the 13,500 with refugee status already in Hong Kong, within three years. Two thousand new places were offered in the United Kingdom. It was made clear also, and accepted by all the countries represented at the conference, that those who are not refugees should return to Vietnam.
The screening procedures are being followed thoroughly and fairly with the full involvement of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Hong Kong has no interest in keeping down the number who qualify as refugees. However, on the basis of the results so far, it is probable that around 40,000 of the 57,000 now in Hong Kong will not qualify. They will not be resettled, and it surely cannot be humane or possible to leave them indefinitely in camps in Hong Kong. The reality is that their only future home is in Vietnam.
It would, of course, be better if people who are not deemed to be refugees returned to Vietnam voluntarily, and we are doing everything to encourage them to accept that it is in their own interest to do so. However, Hong Kong now has more than one year's experience of screening and it is evident that voluntary repatriation alone cannot match the scale of the problem.
354 In common with my two predecessors as Foreign Secretary, my right hon. Friend the Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Major) and my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Surrey, East (Sir G. Howe), I have looked long and hard at the problem in the hope of finding an easier answer. We are continuing closely to consult Vietnam and the authorities in Hong Kong, and all that I can add today is that we have been forced to reach the conclusion that we cannot responsibly avoid the difficult question of involuntary repatriation. In practice, we are increasingly left with little choice.
§ Mr. Robert N. Wareing (Liverpool, West Derby)
Has the Foreign Secretary considered the option of developing with our international partners a development package for Vietnam itself? What is wrong with training the Vietnamese who have gone to Hong Kong seeking a better life and then allowing them to work in Hong Kong as contract labour, in the way that British subjects work under contract in the Gulf states? Would that not be more humane than forcibly repatriating people by a means that would not be considered for one moment by the West German Government in respect of East Germans from Leipzig and Dresden?
§ Mr. Hurd
The people who are returning to Vietnam now under the voluntary arrangement are receiving help with resettlement. That is a perfectly sensible principle and one that could be extended. I am not excluding that principle when I say that we are in touch with the Vietnam Government. However, I prefer not to go into further detail at this time.
I return to the future of Hong Kong itself. We continue to regard the joint declaration—an achievement in which my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Surrey, East played a primary role—as the best available foundation for our policy in Hong Kong. China also remains committed to the joint declaration. No alternative has been offered that would be capable of safeguarding Hong Kong's stability and present life. I ask the critics of this or that aspect of our policy in Hong Kong whether they accept that the joint declaration is the best foundation and, with it, the consequences of the way in which we handle ourselves in respect of particular matters. Or do our critics have some other foundation for the future of Hong Kong that would enable us to indulge in popular gestures as if China did not exist or as if 1997 is of no importance? If so, perhaps they will tell us what that other foundation is. It is no use saying, as some do, "If I were you, I wouldn't start from here." We must start from the geographical and historical facts.
If the joint declaration provides, as we believe it does, a valid and viable basis for Hong Kong's future, Britain has a crucial responsibility in working to implement it successfully. That will be hard and trying work. There is no question of our sitting back and saying, "It is all up to the Chinese Government. There is nothing that we British can do or say."
We are working to strengthen confidence in three main ways. We are preparing, as the House knows, a scheme of assurances to give key people in the public and private sectors the confidence to remain in Hong Kong. We shall fulfil our responsibilities for the administration of the territory, taking full account of the wishes of the people of Hong Kong. We are reviewing the pace of democratisation in Hong Kong, and the Hong Kong Government will soon 355 publish a Bill of Rights. Finally, we are seeking the support of our friends and partners for Hong Kong's future stability and prosperity. Hong Kong's confidence in itself will be strengthened by assurances that its trading partners have a continuing interest in its future.
§ Mr. David Howell (Guildford)
Will my hon. Friend confirm that the Chinese Basic Law drafting committee is to hold its final session before Christmas in about three weeks' time, and that that session will include its final views on the pace of democratisation in Hong Kong after 1997? Will he confirm that, if we wished to choose a different pace or to depart in any way from the committee's decision, we should have to take such steps in the next three weeks?
§ Mr. Hurd
We have a responsibility to decide on the arrangements for 1997, of course that is related to whatever appears in the basic law concerning arrangements following that date. The timing of our decision is therefore related to the timing of the basic law. When we have reached a conclusion, we shall of course inform the House and the people of Hong Kong. I want to visit Hong Kong in the new year, and I should prefer to do so after decisions on these matters have been made and announced.
We will maintain our efforts on behalf of Hong Kong and its people. We will work patiently, intensively and honourably to rebuild their confidence in a secure and prosperous future.
§ Mr. David Young (Bolton, South-East)
Have discussions touched on the right of the Chinese to station the People's Liberation Army—the principal instrument of suppression—in Hong Kong? Does the Foreign Secretary accept that their ability to do so is one of the causes of the lack of confidence that now exists in Hong Kong?
§ Mr. Hurd
I am aware of the importance and sensitivity of that issue. I would rather not give an answer off the cuff about what has occurred in the past, as I have not been personally involved, but I shall write to the hon. Gentleman about what is clearly a legitimate question.
I feel strongly that it is a notable privilege to stand here as Foreign Secretary at the Dispatch Box. That would be true at any time, but it is particularly true in this autumn of 1989. I hope that Europe's response to events whose drama we all feel has shown that we are not afraid of change. Certainly we want stability, and feel that change must be orderly, but that does not mean clinging to old assumptions. We are ready to modify our policies in the light of events, as we have done throughout the period in which Mr. Gorbachev has directed the affairs of the Soviet Union. Our democratic institutions—NATO and the European Community—are strong enough to accommodate and adapt to change: orderly change is our ally.
New opportunities are opening up in Europe as a result of the peaceful changes in the East, and we are well placed to take those opportunities. We are confident in our policies, in our relationships with our allies and partners and in the values on which all else depends.

§.
§ Mr. David Howell (Guildford)
I hope that the right hon. Member for Manchester, Gorton (Mr. Kaufman) will forgive me if I do not follow closely his scissors-and-paste selection of newspapers cuttings to which he seems to have paid great attention. The only advice that I can give him as one occasional journalist to another is not to believe everything you write in the newspapers. Instead, I should like to follow one of two points raised by my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary in his opening speech.
I shall start with Hong Kong. We have to take some critical decisions rather soon. My right hon. Friend and his colleagues are preparing a package of provisions for passports and for a system to encourage people to stay in Hong Kong. I realise the difficulties in putting that package together, but it has to be done as soon as possible. I understand that we look forward to it by the end of this year. But that is not all. In a few weeks' time the Chinese will have their final session of Basic Law drafting in which they will decide the pattern of democracy that they want in Hong Kong after 1997. Immediately, we shall have to decide whether we wish to converge with that date in 1997 or diverge from it. Should we seek a pace of democratic development somewhat faster than that proposed in the earlier draft of the Basic Law, or should we support the Chinese inclinations?
The Legislative Council of Hong Kong has made known its views that by 1991 one third of the legislative council should be elected—that is, 20 seats out of 60. When the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs reported in the summer it proposed an even faster rate. So what should we do now? The House has to face a delicate and difficult issue, borne on the broad shoulders of my right hon. Friend. It is an agonising point of decision.
If I may offer a thought on the matter—this may be our last chance to do so in the House before the decisions are taken—we have to steer an immensely sensitive path. We do not wish to be seen to kowtow to the sullen and boorish mood prevailing in Peking since the events in Tiananmen square in the summer, which is regrettable, and which I hope will pass. Nor do we want to display an attitude of bravado and deliberate provocation, to undo the facts of life in Hong Kong which are that it is deeply involved with China, it is next to China and its entire future is bound up with China. We have to move with great delicacy and care. In deciding the pace of democratic development in Hong Kong between now and 1997 we should primarily stick to our instincts and do what is best for Hong Kong. As my right hon. Friend said, we should proceed on a basis of what is good for and wanted by the Hong Kong community, which brings us back to the old problem of translating and identifying that.
In its latest pronouncements, the Legislative Council has done a thorough job—perhaps as thorough as possible—in establishing what Hong Kong wants, which is not to move so fast as some members of the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs recommended, but a little faster than some of the foot-dragging suggestions in the drafts of the Basic Law. I suggest to my right hon. Friend that so long as we keep our eye on that and do what is right for Hong Kong, although we may run into some flare-up remarks from Peking, as my right hon. and hon. Friends have already discovered when they stated perfectly reasonable principles in Kuala Lumpur, and although there may be a short-term objection from Peking, in the long term we 367 shall be doing the right thing for Hong Kong, for the principles in which we believe and for Peking and the People's Republic of China when its present dark phase has passed.
That is all that I have to say about Hong Kong, but I repeat that this may be the last chance for the House to utter views which will be taken into account in very difficult decisions governing the shape and future of that territory as it moves through a difficult period in the months ahead.
The second issue touched on by my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary and by the right hon. Member for Gorton is Strasbourg and the meeting on 9 December, which will be enormously important in shaping the future of western Europe and our relations with eastern Europe. The right hon. Gentleman made great play of Britain standing alone, one against 11, and so on. I do not understand why he is so appalled at the idea of Britain standing alone. I make no apology for that. From time to time Britain has stood alone and been right. It is more important that we be true to our principles. The question as to whether we are alone should come second to the question as to whether we are right. The right hon. Gentleman seemed to take the view that we should give in to mounting pressures. Is it his approach to foreign policy that every time there are mounting pressures we should give in to them? Instead, he should be asking what is the true position for which we are standing and whether it is correct. If it is correct, whether we are one against 11, two against 10 or three against nine, we should fight and argue for it in a constructive, sensible and positive way.
§ Mr. Frank Cook (Stockton, North)
Is the right hon. Gentleman seriously suggesting that we should continue our membership of various alliances such as the North Atlantic Alliance, the European Economic Community, the United Nations or the Commonwealth and still insist on consistently standing aside? The only ally with which we seem to have no dispute on any issue is the United States. When shall we stand alone from the United States?
§ Mr. Howell
I was not suggesting anything of the kind. I was merely reminding the House—heaven knows, the House ought to know—that just because one stands alone that does not mean one is wrong on every occasion. I see no difficulty about standing alone if we are true to our principles and put forward our arguments clearly. However, to take up a phrase used by the hon. Member for Stockton, North (Mr. Cook), I see difficulties not in standing alone but in standing aside from the great debate about Europe and the development of the European Community. I am not happy about the idea put forward by Mr. Andriessen yesterday that we should be placed back in the European Free Trade Association. It would be a catastrophe for Britain and for Europe if one of the three great leading nations of Europe—the German Federal Republic, France and Britain—were to be marginalised in that way. That would be totally wrong. We must remain at the centre of those debates and arguments. Although we may stand alone on certain issues, we need to seek allies, as we have done in the past. We have to consider the viewpoints expressed by other Governments and their supporters to gain common ground on some of the issues in which we believe.
I have to report that France and the Federal Republic of Germany are utterly determined to go ahead with 368 Delors stages 2 and 3, the reform of the treaties, European monetary union, a single central bank and a variety of other issues, including the social charter. I know that some may draw comfort from signs that the governor of the Bundesbank is unhappy about his independent status being submerged in a much larger European bank, but his view will not prevail—Chancellor Kohl and President Mitterrand will take hands and move forward on all those issues and take some extremely radical decisions.
During the past week members of the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs had an opportunity in Paris to discuss with a whole range of senior officials what is now proposed. We were told quite clearly that athough the changes required for Delors stages 2 and 3 mean a total revision of the position of the Banque de France and the entire French system—the same would be involved for the Bank of England—they were already preparing proposals to bring that about. They were prepared to embark on this revolution—that was the word used—to pursue the policy with West Germanty.
§ Mrs. Dunwoody
What would be the right hon. Gentleman's attitude if a third treaty were brought forward? The House would have to take a fundamental decision at that point. If we were still standing alone, what would be the attitude of the right hon. Gentleman and his party to that decision?
§ Mr. Howell
My attitude is that we must be constructively involved in discussions at every point. Whether we take an individual view or whether we go along with others would emerge from debate, but we must be involved because it is possible that new treaties will shortly be before us.We must take a constructive approach, we must be involved, we must have ideas—not only those set out in the Madrid communiqúe on stage 1—and we must participate in, even if to resist and point out some of its more muddled aspects, the discussions on stages 2 and 3. I also believe that, whether we join in stages 2 and 3 or whether we join fully in stage 1 and participate in the exchange rate mechanism, for our own sakes we need an independent central monetary authority. I realise that that is another issue, but one has only to consider what has been happening to our monetary aggregates over the past year to see that our monetary discipline lacks the proper mechanisms to keep it in place. The essential point was made by my right hon. Friend—that we must be centrally involved and that we cannot be pushed aside into EFTA or any other arrangements.
There is room for honest and full debate about the direction of the European community. We have agreed on the single market although, as my right hon. Friend rightly said, there are still many provisions to be fulfilled by other countries before that colossal work is done. We must look beyond what is happening in eastern Europe, Japan, the United States and elsewhere, because there is a need to define our alternative vision of how the Community should develop after 1993. I find no difficulty, as some others seem to, in analysing or agonising about whether it will be a Community of nation states or a collectivist mush—an enormous European cake that will submerge the nation states—because I know perfectly well, as do hon. Members and members of the Assembleé Nationale and the Bundestag, that nation states will remain the central feature of the Community of Europe. The nation state is 369 the fundamental unit. If there were no nation states and we were one great federated super-state, nation states would have to be reinvented to adminster and govern the varieties and differences of Europe of the 1990s and of the next millennium.
I foresee no need for us to lose too much sleep in establishing that certain things will be done usefully and most efficiently collectively in the European Community, and that they may include supervision of aspects of economic or monetary policy. The nation states will remain powerful, proud and highly effective instruments of administration and givers of law in the Europe of 10, 20 or 30 years ahead.
I make no apology for talking about a vision of Europe that is a great confederation of free states bound in permanent union, as other great confederations have been in the past, which does not lose or undermine the vital national identity on which our freedoms are based and in which they are rooted.
A word is bandied about to describe the guiding principle that should ensure that we keep our integrity as nation states—whether it be Britain or France—but nevertheless work collectively where we can most effectively do so. It is an ugly word that is not even English—subsidiarity. As Anglo-Saxons, we need to translate it to English and apply it with vigour to ensure that our version of its meaning—that things should only be done collectively which cannot be done better and more efficiently at nation state level—is used. If we do not apply our version, it will tend to be a potentially elastic concept used by Commission officials, empire builders, collectivists and federal accumulators of functions in Brussels to mean nothing very much. Let us establish what we mean by subsidiarity and state our vision of Europe as a great confederation of free states and the only conceivable way in which Europe will work in the future. Let us not be cowed by federalist claptrap, generalist talk of European super-states or the inclination of some of our American friends who arrive on our doorstep and ask why we do not have a United States of Europe. That is an old-fashioned idea which belongs to the 1960s. In the 1990s and in the next century, a confederation of nation states will prevail.
Although we were advised to wait until next week to debate eastern Europe, my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary commented on it, and obviously what is happening there is central to our affairs. I must apologise to the House because I understand that the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs report on eastern Europe will be taken in next Friday's debate. As its chairman, it is my duty to be present. I must ask for the House's indulgence, because I shall have been meeting a committee of the Bundestag in Bonn and therefore will not be present. I shall therefore detain the House with a couple of comments on eastern Europe now.
After all the talk of the wonderful and splendid things happening in eastern Europe and of the emotion, which undoubtedly is great, we must realise that all the eastern European countries will now go through the most hideous valley of tears. They are all in great economic difficulties, and to get out of them they will have to pass through far greater privation than they have experienced so far. That applies to the Poles and the Hungarians, and certainly to the East Germans. The East German economy is currently 370 being destroyed by the West Germans, the deutschmark and West German purchasing power buying up all the basic goods at their ridiculously subsidised prices. Shortly, the East Germans may again have to close the border if their economy is to survive even over the next few weeks. To talk splendidly about the associations of the future with Eastern Europe is to live in a world of fantasy, while the reality is an extremely ugly and cold winter closing in on these new little democracies, where they are democracies, and possibly suffocating many of them. I have a grave fear that in Czechoslovakia we shall see the first example of this wonderful process going tragically and disastrously wrong in the short term. Let us be realists, because it will not be beer and skittles and the arrival of liberalism and democracy. There are many difficulties immediately ahead.
What can we do about those difficulties? Do we stand aside while those countries go forward or backward into tyranny again? We must do certain things, recognising that democracy and freedom are not only about politics and Governments but about civic activity, literature, the arts, publishing and all kinds of cultural contacts. We can build and develop those things with enormous vigour through our know-how, funds and a variety of contacts outside the normal official Government machine. That is where we in Britain can and should help.
Above all, we should settle our quarrels in western Europe, settle on the clear vision of the future in western Europe, which is the only realistic one, and prepare our links at every humble level—the level of the private citizen, non-governmental organisations and, indeed, the level of enterprise, business and commerce with the eastern European economies to help them through the dark times through which they must still pass before they become free and prosperous democracies.
§ Mr. Denis Healey (Leeds, East)
I have read so many obituaries of myself in the past few days that I sometimes feel that I am already dead. Yet I have never in my life felt quite so alive as I felt just over a week ago when I stood in the Potsdamer platz in East Berlin and watched East and West Germans together, laughing and weeping with happiness at the coming down of the wall. The speed of change in eastern Europe is now so great that it is difficult to see clearly how things will go. It is still too soon to be sure whether there has been a repetition of 1848, which ran into the sand, or of 1789, which developed into a new dictatorship, or, as I would hope, of 1688.
Having said that, I believe that certain conclusions can already be drawn. The changes in eastern Europe are bound to have fundamental implications, both for the European Community and for NATO. I shall risk some predictions about the impact on the European Community. First, I doubt very much whether the 1992 process will go very much further. I do not foresee the members of the Community agreeing on tax harmonisation, on the removal of all subsidies or on adopting the same policy for all Government procurement.
In some ways, the most important impact of 1992 has already been felt. There has been massive investment inside the Community, from which we in Britain have greatly benefited, by countries outside—in particular, the United States and Japan. I think that in future those countries will increasingly tend to invest in eastern Europe—particularly in eastern Germany and perhaps in 371 Czechoslovakia, if a similar revolution takes place there. That will also happen increasingly with members of the Community. The United States has already bought a major electrical company in Hungary, and Volkswagen and several other German firms are already buying up property in eastern Germany. Lech Walesa suggested to Congress the other day that American capital might well buy up 80 per cent. of Polish industry. Whatever Governments may decide, the two halves of Europe will be growing together economically.
The second conclusion it is possible now to draw is that the European Community will not develop into a defence community—there is no chance of the West German Government or, in my view, the French or British Governments, agreeing to that. If the Community does not develop into a defence community, it cannot develop into a political federation.
§ Sir Geoffrey Finsberg (Hampstead and Highgate)
Will the right hon. Gentleman give way?
§ Mr. Healey
No, with respect. I have very little time and I must proceed.
There is no need for the Prime Minister—and some of my hon. Friends—to fear that the Community will develop into a federation. The Prime Minister can now cease behaving—as Leon Brittan, now a European Commissioner, described it—like a superannuated sumo wrestler. I suspect that he was also thinking of her antagonist, the previous Conservative Prime Minister, when he used that phrase.
The third point about the Community is that it is ridiculous to suggest, as the French President suggests, that it is possible to develop the Community into a tighter organisation that will be capable of controlling a united Germany. The plain fact is that West Germany alone already dominates the Community economically. The European monetary system is a deutschmark zone. The best demonstration of that reality came a few weeks ago, when the British Chancellor was compelled to raise interest rates by 1 per cent. within 60 minutes of the Bundesbank raising interest rates, although he had spent $3,000 million of our reserves trying to hold off an interest rate increase until after the Conservative party conference.
On the other hand, it is a mistake to believe that what has happened will lead to the early reunification of Germany. Like other hon. Members who have visited Berlin in the past 10 days, I have been struck by the fact that most east Berliners with whom one talked or of whom one heard through friends in west Berlin are no more attracted by the idea of joining West Germany than we in Britain were attracted to joining the United States of America in 1945, even though we knew that living standards in the United States were much higher. I agree with my right hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Gorton (Mr. Kaufman) that eastern Germany, Poland and Hungary hope to create a new form of democratic Socialism rather than abandon all chances of moving in that direction by joining western Germany now.
It strikes me that emerging from recent events is the possibility of creating a pan-European framework that could safely contain a reunited Germany, but that framework would mean extending the Community to include eastern neighbours such as Poland and Hungary, probably by the end of the century the Baltic states, and possibly even Russia, the Ukraine and Georgia. I 372 personally believe that the Russian empire will break up in the next 10 years, just as all the other international empires of the 19th century have broken up over the past 40 years. We face exciting new possibilities. For the Government and the Foreign Secretary to refuse to consider enlarging the Community until some impossible development has taken place is to miss opportunities that are enormously more exciting than those presented by the Community in its present form.
What are the implications for NATO? Unlike many people, I believe that NATO and the Warsaw pact will still play a vital role, but in creating a new security system based on deep cuts in existing forces and the restructuring of the forces that remain so that they become incapable of aggression. It will be essential to have a framework for military stability in a period of great political turbulence. NATO has already made it impossible for Greece and Turkey to fight each other over the eastern Aegean, as they certainly would have done without NATO. The Warsaw pact has made it impossible for Hungary and Romania to fight each other, as they certainly would have done by now, were it not for the Warsaw pact.
The joint existence of NATO and the Warsaw pact has made it impossible for Turkey and Bulgaria to fight, as they might well be contemplating were it not for the existence of the alliances. I agree with my right hon. Friend the Member for Gorton about the need for Britain to participate in deep cuts in defence spending such as those to which the United States and the Soviet Union have already committed themselves unilaterally.
In this changing world, only one thing seems incapable of change, and that is the British Prime Minister. Her resolute refusal to recognise reality is to the dismay and despair of her Government. As a result, Britain is as isolated in the Community and in NATO, as it was recently isolated in the Commonwealth. Now we hear that the Prime Minister intends to stay on for ever "by popular acclaim," so any hope that the chairman of the Conservative party had of playing Egon Krenz to her Honecker, or that the right hon. Member for Henley (Mr. Heseltine) had of playing Modrow to the Egon Krenz of the chairman of the Conservative party has gone. As my right hon. Friend said, it is clear that the Prime Minister intends to be the Ceausescu of the West, and the main function of the chairman of the Tory party at the next conference will be to arrange 69 standing ovations for her, as Ceausescu was able to enjoy at his recent meeting.
I appeal to the Prime Minister's colleagues on the Government Front Bench and in the Cabinet now to sink their personal rivalries and ambitions and to unite in compelling the Prime Minister not necessarily to resign, but at least to recognise reality. They may well discover that if they succeed in persuading her to recognise reality, they will succeed in persuading her to resign as well.
§ Mr. Michael Marshall (Arundel)
Leaving aside the skilful piece of mischief-making with which the right hon. Member for Leeds, East (Mr. Healey) enjoyed himself towards the end of his speech, it is a privilege to follow him. Many of us are conscious that we shall miss that privilege in the future; and I am glad that my remarks will touch also on some of his personal activities.
373 I know that the House will understand if I refer to the international situation within the context of Inter-Parliamentary Union activities. The events in eastern Europe and the references to them in the Queen's Speech relate strongly to work that has now gone on for many years and has involved hon. Members of all parties, and it is timely for us now to take stock of that. I respond directly to what my right hon. Friend the Member for Guildford (Mr. Howell) said when he asked what could be done outside Government to carry forward the process of understanding and of giving assistance to the Parliaments of eastern Europe. I echo the cautionary note that he sounded, because I do not think that it is time for euphoria. However, as one who like many others has observed the scene for many years, I cannot but feel a deep sense of emotion when considering the events in, for example, eastern Germany.
In 1967 I went to the Leipzig Trade Fair—I was not a Member of the House then—and I was billeted, as one was in those days, with an East German family. I vividly recall a sense of wonder at the fact that they were receiving West German television although it was banned and despite the interference that was deliberately introduced to try to prevent that message coming through. Nevertheless, they received that message because they were prepared to take all kinds of risks. I remember wondering what the effect of that might be over the years—I think that we have seen some of the answer to that recently.
I am glad that there may shortly be an opportunity for officers of the IPU to visit East Germany. We have responded to a long-standing invitation. I emphasise, when doing so, it is right that we as British parliamentarians should carry West German parliamentarians with us because it is part of our thinking that we should consult them, given their obvious and direct involvement in that whole process.
Coming back to the question of how we can help with relations between East and West, I recall the year 1984, when Mr. Gorbachev, before he was leader of the Soviet Union, arrived as leader of the IPU delegation. The contacts then made, his own statements on perestroika and the value that he has put on parliamentary links as part of what he describes as international democracy, have in so many ways, helped to drive forward the process of establishing personal links between this Parliament and others in Eastern Europe.
Together with my noble Friend Viscount Whitelaw, the right hon. member for Leeds, East led a delegation to the Soviet Union in 1986, which took that process further. The right hon. Gentleman knows that we are expecting the inward visit of another Soviet delegation shortly. That is a mark of the way in which the Soviet leadership and parliamentarians have continued to maintain this momentum and drive, and despite the many frustrations, such as the fact that their planning process and ours do not always match, and we are currently in some confusion about confirming arrangements, I know that they will continue. I believe that they are of ever-increasing importance.
Similarly, in our links with Hungary, and because of the changing events in Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria, there are 374 opportunities for us as parliamentarians to build on the links we have established and to carry them forward into the future.
However, it is not just a question of what we in this Parliament are doing. I recognise, of course, the work of the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs, and I was glad that my right hon. Friend the Member for Guildford spoke as he did. I concur very much with his analysis of the way ahead in eastern Europe. However, bodies outside the House are also involved in this, such as the Hansard Society for Parliamentary Government. In our own Houses of Parliament, through the Association of Secretaries-General of Parliament, our Clerks are going out to provide detailed advice and comment in response to requests for information and are giving help to others who are looking at changing their parliamentary structures. All these things have significance.
In the brief time available to me, I should now like to turn to one or two aspects of how I believe the process might be taken further. After all, through organisations such as the IPU, we have a chance to involve a very large number of parliamentarians. Above all, it is our opportunity to bring Back Benchers into the process, and that is why it is worth taking time to outline some of our thoughts and plans for the future. In the development of bilateral relationships within eastern Europe, perhaps we could move gradually towards the sort of structure we envisage with our Irish colleagues. The proposed British-Irish parliamentary body, which will involve 35 parliamentarians on each side and meet twice a year, is intended to give continuity in this process of exchange. Even with the best will in the world, the Select Committee, the IPU and any other organisation meeting from time to time must inevitably switch its attention in various directions. More permanent links that would give us the opportunity to carry forward the process of developing representative institutions, which is one of the key objectives of the IPU, should be seriously considered.
I have stressed the role of Back Benchers. From time to time, we are able to co-opt those such as the right hon. Member for Leeds, East. We also draw on the experience of the hon. Member for Swansea, East (Mr. Anderson) who sits on our executive. We are seeking to carry with us a broad spectrum of opinion in this House. However, it is perhaps in Back-Bench activity that we can best meet the point raised by my right hon. Friend the Member for Guildford about helping many other parliamentarians who are going through periods of extreme difficulty and change by establishing human contact and understanding. We do not want to put over the view, "We have the Westminster model and it is a superior version," because, from the approaches we have had and which you, Madam Deputy Chairman, have received from women parliamentarians, it is clear that there is ever-increasing interest in drawing on our experience of our democracy over many centuries. We would be foolish, not to say churlish, if we did not respond.
I should now like to outline a couple of proposals that I hope may take some of these activities yet further forward. Within the offices of the IPU, we are currently putting together some preliminary studies about how we might formalise the discussions and dialogue that we have with east European countries. We are mindful of the work done by the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association in its seminars. While there is no direct parallel with that, we have great areas of expertise within our Parliament, not 375 only among parliamentarians but as I have already said, through our Clerks. Perhaps we could bring together a number of the disparate strands of those links and try to provide a natural forum. We are looking at a model that might allow us to explore such a process to see whether it might take us on to other activities, which might range over a number of east European countries, either together or individually, but we shall see as we develop that process.
If we look beyond the opportunities that we now have, we should also reflect on the fact that we shall inevitably still receive many demands to exchange visits and to meet in IPU conferences. In doing that, we should try not just to exchange courtesies—the usual round of activities, the cultural exchanges and so on—but increasingly to build on a body of knowledge and experience. That is why I stress continuity. Otherwise there is a tendency to take a subject up and then to put it down again.
In this context, it is reasonable to remind the House that this is the centenary of the IPU. One has to look at the broad historical sweep of those enlightened founding parliamentarians who saw that both the peaceful resolution of conflict and the development of representative institutions have key objectives, for ourselves and those that we seek to serve. In praising Randal Cremer, and the Asquith-Balfour coalition committee which greeted the first Russian delegation in 1910, I remind the House that we have an opportunity, to carry on that great tradition.
§ Mr. Ernie Ross (Dundee, West)
As we approach the end of the decade, it is useful to look back to its start, and in particular to a debate on East-West relations held in this Chamber on 28 January 1980. It is worth reflecting on the aspirations, hopes and assertions made by right hon. and hon. Members in that debate, and on whether those aspirations, hopes and assertions had any basis in fact, as we near the end of the decade. Equally, it is useful for those of us who are making positive assertions today on how the next decade is likely to turn out to reflect on some of the mistakes made by those who spoke in that debate.
If we are to play a role in the next decade, we have to make up our minds now about what type of world it is and how we can shape it. In Britain in 1980, we had a gung-ho Prime Minister who, by her determination to mirror almost every action taken by the United States, was already helping to stoke up the cold war. By arms spending decisions and her rhetoric, she was inexorably leading the country towards the Falklands conflict and all the pain, suffering and loss of life borne not by politicians but by ordinary families in Britain and the Argentine. Often those British families had to suffer as a consequence of other decisions made by the same politicians.
It is also interesting to look at some of the editorials of that time. On 29 January 1980, The Times was talking about another leader. It was taking President Carter to task for his naive belief—naive in the eyes of The Times—when he first took office, that there should be deep cuts in American spending. But The Times felt that its readers could sleep peacefully in their beds that night because the military industrial complex quickly got a grip on the nuclear physicist who was then president, and bamboozled him into increasing arms spending by 3.8 per cent. per annum. The Times reassured its readers by saying:Mr. Carter's response seems not excessive but merely adequate.376 Fortunately for Africa and the homeless in America, once out of office Mr. Carter regained his sanity and committed himself to building low-cost housing for the homeless in America and courageously and assiduosly, to bringing the peoples of Ethiopia and Sudan, through dialogue and confidence-building, to peace. He rejected the comment in the same editorial in The Times that he should be increasing America's ability to deploy its forces throughout the world, wherever and whenever it was best for the interests of the western world.
In that debate in 1980, and in The Times editorial of 30 January 1980, we referred to another president who was hitting the headlines. In this case, the editorial was far more foresighted, and got it right, tragically, for both President Anwar Sadat and the Palestinian people. Speaking of his determination to bring peace to the middle east and to extract from the Israeli Government concessions for the Palestinian people, the editorial said:He was right to do so but he is now dangerously isolated, and the unity of the Arab world is more badly needed than ever. He still has to prove that he was right. The only way he can do so is to reach an agreement which satisfies the Palestinians. The only lever left to him is the normalization process. To let this move on without parallel progress towards an agreement on Palestinian autonomy would be suicidal. Ultimately, too, it would be contrary to Israeli interests because it would set back the whole process of reaching a settlement in the Middle East.At the moment the gap between Israel and Egypt on the Palestinian issue is still dangerously wide. Last week Egypt rejected an Israeli scheme which offered severely limited autonomy. This week Israel has said it will reject the latest Egyptian plan, which would grant the Palestinians wider powers of self rule.Fortunately for the Palestinian people and the middle east peace process, another Egyptian president has brought his country back fairly and squarely into political leadership of the Arab world. The magnificent efforts for the resolution of the Palestinian-Israeli problem made by President Hosni Mubarak are being frustrated by International Monetary Fund financial restrictions forced on an Egyptian economy that is struggling to maintain and sustain 52 million people on 3 per cent. of the land—97 per cent. of the land is desert—and that is losing 2 billion cubic ft of water because of the conflict in southern Sudan. Those financial restrictions can only exacerbate food shortages and lead to further gains by l Islamic fundamentalism in Egypt and to further problems for President Mubarak. They could severely restrict his ability to continue his work to bring peace and stability to the middle east. Egypt requires recognition of the need to proceed slowly and carefully towards economic and social change.
It is useful to reflect on another part of the world about which many of us spoke in 1980—south-east Asia. Only a couple of weeks ago, we had a debate on the problems of the sad country of Cambodia. During that debate Opposition Members, starting with my right hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Gorton (Mr. Kaufman), tried to give the views and express the opinions and concerns of many ordinary people over the failure of Her Majesty's Government to deal properly with the re-emergence of the Khmer Rouge into the political process and military warfare in Cambodia. All that came from the Government side in response were accusations that we were being anti-American—having a kick at the United States and enjoying the masotistic pleasure that they seem to think we gain from doing so.
377 If the Government and Conservative Members are not prepared to listen to us, perhaps they would like to hear about the editorial in the International Herald Tribune of 21 November, which quoted from the New York Times. It talked about the way in which Cambodia was being abused, and asked:Why won't the world, even now, recognise reality in Cambodia?It considered the Khmer Rouge and the Hun Sen regime, and continued:Yet does the world, including the Bush administration, respond? With policies conceived years ago that are worse than stagnant; they are repugnant. The cynical idea was to co-operate tacitly with the Khmer Rouge in order to expel the Vietnamese. Now the Vietnamese are gone. Only Hun Sen's army stands between the Khmer Rouge and their former killing fields.The editorial makes the point that the Hun Sen Government still lack legitimacy, but are clearly preferable to another round of Khmer Rouge killings. It then referred to the decisions taken by the United Nations, and the fact that the Bush Administration still did not recognise what was required—supervised, free elections. It still did not recognise the tragedy that would emerge if the Khmer Rouge were allowed to re-enter that country.
I apologise to right hon. and hon. Members. I have to leave because I have a surgery in my constituency tonight, so I will not be able to stay for the winding-up speeches.
§ Mr. Cecil Franks (Barrow and Furness)
I warmly welcome the Gracious Speech and particularly that part which gives a firm commitment to maintaining adequate and effective nuclear and conventional forces.
I must put it on record that only a Conservative Government could give that commitment and fulfil it. Defence is a matter of national concern and concerns all right hon. and hon. Members. However, my constituency is the home of the Trident submarine, and I have therefore the greatest interest in the effect of defence expenditure on employment. It is pertinent to remind the House about the Opposition's defence policy in the 1980s.
In 1983, the Labour party campaigned on a programme to scrap all nuclear weapons and to scrap the Trident programme; and the nation gave its verdict. In 1987, the Labour party campaigned on a policy of decommissioning the Polaris fleet and scrapping Trident. In 1989, the Opposition's policy is to scrap the fourth Trident submarine. That would have devastating consequences for my constituents.
Once again, I pose a question that I have consistently posed during the past six and half years, and to which I have not had yet an answer. If there is a general election on a Thursday, a Labour Government on a Friday and a Labour Cabinet meeting on a Saturday morning cancelling Trident, what will the 14,000 people in the shipyards of Barrow do on Monday morning? Will they register as unemployed? I hope that sooner or later—perhaps today—I shall get an answer to that question.
Who is the authentic voice of the Labour party today? Is it the hon. Member for Clackmannan (Mr. O'Neill), who sits on the Front Bench, rejected by his parliamentary colleagues when they elected a Shadow Cabinet? Or is it represented by the charms of the hon. Member for Cynon 378 Valley (Mrs. Clwyd), who is a member of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament? She enjoys the support of her parliamentary colleagues and now sits on the Front Bench.
The right hon. Member for Manchester, Gorton (Mr. Kaufman) referred to democratic Socialism. What an incredible state of affairs it is when Socialism needs to be qualified. Socialism is the antithesis of freedom—it subjugates individual will and choice to the perceived wisdom of the state. Have hon. Members forgotten so quickly one of the most infamous events of 20th century history? The Ribbentrop-Molotov pact, which extinguished the flame of freedom in Poland for the past 50 years. Has the right hon. Member for Gorton forgotten the two principal authors of that pact—two self-declared Socialists, Stalin and Hitler? Have we forgotten that the word Nazi is an abbreviation for National Socialist? Have we forgotten 1953, when the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics sent its tanks into the streets of East Berlin, once again to extinguish the torch of freedom? Have we forgotten 1956 and Hungary? Have we forgotten 1968 and the Prague spring? Have we forgotten the 1970s, and Pol Pot and his murderous regime? Are we unmindful of the boat people fleeing from the tyrannies of Socialism in south-east Asia? Have we forgotten so quickly the lessons of Tiananmen square, where Socialist tanks were turned on their own people whose only crime was to seek to be free?
There can be very few people who have not been moved deeply by the storming of the modern Bastille—the Berlin wall—by the young people of East Germany and East Berlin. There can be few who did not shed tears of their own on seeing the tears of joy of those who made the perilous journey from East Germany to the freedom of the West. A whole generation of young people who have known nothing but the tyranny of Socialism have sought the hope and inspiration that they can find in the West.
Are we to relax our vigilance in the 1990s because the first faltering steps on the road of freedom have been taken? Are we to be so unmindful of the fact that the Berlin wall was built in a matter of days and that it can just as easily and quickly be rebuilt in a matter of days?
Freedom is such a fragile thing. Man has known so little of it in his entire history. It is never more than a generation away from extinction. It is not something that we can pass on in the bloodstream. It is not our inheritance. Each generation has to fight for freedom. Each generation has to protect it, defend it, nurture it, cherish it and then pass it on to the next.
If we lose this way of ours—our way of freedom—history will record with the greatest astonishment that those who had so much to lose with the loss of freedom did so little to defend it. Are we to spend our sunset years telling our children and our children's children what it was like when men were free? What will our answer be when they ask, "Where were you when freedom was lost? What was it that you found that was more precious?"
§ Mr. Frank Cook (Stockton, North)
I resent having to devote part of my 10 minutes to comment on the speech made by the hon. Member for Barrow and Furness (Mr. Franks), but I feel compelled to do so because he displayed the same tired intellect groping for the same tired old logic when trying to express in the same tired old phrases what he had previously said in the same tired old presentation. 379 It is pathetic that a speech about the Queen's Speech, which is supposed to lay out the Government's programme, should bring out such hack comments. As for Socialism being qualified, I hope that the hon. Member for Barrow and Furness will note that Britain experienced the best kind of Socialism in the years 1939–45 when people were prepared to share their strengths with the weak, when those who had were prepared to share possessions with those who had not, and when the strong were prepared to stand shoulder to shoulder with those who had difficulty standing up for themselves. That is the sort of Socialism for which my right hon. and hon. Friends and I stand, and that is the sort of Socialism that the hon. Member for Barrow and Furness should bear in mind when he tries to slag off an honourable principle. But enough of that trash—[Interruption.] I refer, of course, to the speech of the hon. Member for Barrow and Furness.
Any Member who spent part of his youth apple-snagging or scrumping, as we called in in the north, will appreciate the dilemma which faces Opposition Members. The apples to be plucked from the orchard are so ripe and so choice that it is difficult to decide which to go for next we have ambulance provision, food safety, privatisation, top-up loans for students, human fertilisation and embryology, trade union and industrial relations, the plight of pensioners, impoverishment and the prospects for the mentally handicappd. We could go to town on any of those, especially as the custodians of the orchard are in such disarray. They are even attacking one of their own for having the temerity to do what the Prime Minister did 14 years ago. Apparently, it was right for her to take that step then but wrong for anyone else to follow her example.
I shall concentrate on one feature of the Queen's Speech. The two relevant passages state:My Government will maintain their fight against international terrorism",andmy Government will maintain its support for the enforcement of the law and the defeat of terrorism".It is necessary to question the veracity of those claims. The House will know that I am a member of the North Atlantic Assembly and serve on two of its committees. I am obliged to attend plenary sessions and meet people from other member states. I shall read to the House a note that I received from an officer in the Canadian reserve, who works in the policy group of the policy co-ordination division of the directorate of public policy in the national defence headquarters at Ottawa. That officer attended the plenary session in Rome with me and voiced a concern which I asked her to convey to me in writing. She wrote:I would appreciate you bringing the following to the attention of someone who can review security practice at the Guards barracks near Buckingham Palace. As Canadian Guards officers frequently visit the barracks, I would not want to make security so strong that access was impossible.On 25 September, an English lady and I identified ourselves as wives of Canadian guards officers at the main entrance to the Guards barracks off Birdcage Walk. We wanted to go to the kit shop to purchase ties. We were dressed casually, and both caried large shoulder bags. Our names were not asked, our bags were not searched, no identification was requested. A guardsman took us up to the kit shop, which was closed as it was lunch time. He told us to return the next day and ask for a specific sergeant. As we returned across the compound, Mrs. Thatcher arrived in her helicopter, returning from viewing the bomb damage at the barracks in Deal.The next morning (26 September) I returned also to the same entrance to the barracks. Again, I was dressed casually 380 and carried a large shoulder bag. No identification was requested and I was allowed to go to and return from the kit shop alone.The NATO standard scenario for counter-terrorism envisages a determined force of 10 or more committed individuals trained in and equipped with high explosives, chemicals and incendiaries. Are the precautions outlined in that letter adequate to counter that sort of threat?
I am pleased that the Secretary of State for Defence is present on the Government Front Bench because I wish to return to a question that I asked during the reply to the Defence Estimates debate. I want my points to be reasoned and my presentation to be reasonable, as they were then, and I seek a reasonable response.
Bearing in mind the standard NATO scenario of 10 people equipped as I have described, after the slaughter at Wildenrath—when we not only deplored the assassination of the airman and his child, but counted it as some relief that his wife was not so close as to be killed as well—we set about conducting an aggressive survey of service men's wives, canvassing their willingness to act as security guards at defence establishments in West Germany. Are we really serious about that? I do not make the point in any party political sense. I served as a regular, as my son now does, and if I thought that the Government were trying to recruit his wife I should make a lot more of this matter than I am doing today. I want an assurance from the Secretary of State that that sort of canvassing will be put to death immediately and forever.
If we are to make our defence establishments as secure as they should be—God knows, they need to be secure—we should introduce security measures different from those that the serving Canadian reserve officer encountered next to Buckingham palace. We need to put to death the idea that the wives of acting service men, who already risk injury while out shopping, and so on, should be put in the front line where they may be called upon to face the onslaught of the standard NATO scenario. I expect the Secretary of State to deal with those two questions when he replies, and I shall be in the Chamber listening.
§ Mr. Julian Amery (Brighton, Pavilion)
I warmly congratulate my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary on putting the record straight on Europe. He made it clear that we regard ourselves as a main partner in the European Community. He outlined the contribution that we have already made and that we hope to continue making. We have no intention of being sidelined or marginalised.
In any democratic community there will, of course, be controversial issues, and monetary union is the main one today. We can expect the principal actors to indulge in a good deal of posturing. President Mitterrand is a dab hand at that, and my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister is no slouch either. That is quite natural because, in a democracy, and with our already extensive open government, the pursuit of national interest must be matched by consideration for the electorate and the vote.
The issue of monetary union will come to a head intwo or three weeks, but I do not fully share the anxieties of my right hon. Friend the Member for Guildford (Mr. Howell) that we shall be faced with an intransigent Franco-German alliance. The timetable leads me to take a slightly less pessimistic view. The meeting at Strasbourg is to be followed, in due course, by an intergovernmental conference. That probably could not happen until the end 381 of the summer or the autumn at the earliest, and it will be a protracted procedure. It is at that point that all the pressure groups and lobbies will begin to make themselves heard. It will not be a straight issue of accepting Delors stages 2 and 3.
There are many reservations about those two stages. I was impressed to find in Brussels the other day the Commission going out of its way to explain that the Delors report is not a Commission document but an ad hoc document to which the Commission itself is not committed—although obviously Mr. Delors is committed to it to a considerable extent. We know the reservations of the Bundesbank and of its governor, who has already made it plain that he does not want to see Brussels exercising control over the budgetary and fiscal policies of member states. Nor does he see his way to accepting a long-term commitment to stage 3.
The banking authorities in Federal Germany are exceptionally powerful because of the substantial stake that they have in German industry. Therefore, I imagine that the proceedings will be lengthy. My guess is that we shall arrive at an amended stage 2 without a long-term commitment to stage 3, and probably without Brussels exercising any budgetary or fiscal powers.
President Mitterrand has stressed the urgency of pressing ahead with monetary union. We might point out to him that, if he thinks that it is that urgent, there is no reason why he could not have lifted exchange controls already. Were he to do so, we could consider joining the exchange rate mechanism sooner than we might otherwise do. In any event, that development involves highly technical problems that cannot be rushed, so we are in no danger of an immediate confrontation.
I turn to the avalanche in eastern Europe. Despite President Mitterrand's belief that our actions in the Community will have an immediate effect in eastern Europe, the time scale is not as closely connected as he suggests. We all agree on the need to provide first aid to the countries of the East, to tide them over the winter as best we can. We all agreed, also at the Elyseé dinner, that long-term, massive reconstruction for eastern Europe—a kind of Marshall plan—must wait upon reforms, as these will take time. All the countries of eastern Europe are emerging from Socialist control, but they have a long way to go before finding freedom. East Germany has not even begun that process of changing its Government, and Poland's Administration is still in the hands of members of the Communist party that was. The same is largely true of Hungary. Nevertheless, the action taken by the Community will be important in extending the Community, as is our objective and aim, not only to the EFTA countries but ultimately to the emerging democracies of eastern Europe.
We should be careful in two respects. First, we must ensure that in achieving a good measure of integration in the Community, we do not build an economic Berlin wall to keep others out. That point must be made to President Mitterrand, and no doubt it is much more in Chancellor Kohl's mind that he likes to admit. Secondly, we must be careful that a split in the Community does not send the wrong message to eastern Europe and to the EFTA 382 countries. They would like to join a whole Community, not one in which a united Germany would dominate the scene.
I salute President Mitterrand's decision to hold last Saturday's Elysée dinner, because the affairs of eastern Europe concern western Europe directly. It was right to send a message before the Malta summit that it is our primary concern not to see another Yalta.
My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister, speaking as Head of Government, rightly said that there must be no border changes. The mention of border changes reminds one a little of the Organisation of African Unity. She knows very well, as we all do, that the most important border is on the agenda whether Governments like it or not. It have no doubt that German reunion will happen, although I do not know how it will develop. We may rejoice at it or regret it, but nothing that we or any other Government say or do will stop it.
I understand the anxieties of our French friends about the prospect of a reunited Germany. I agree with the right hon. Member for Leeds, East (Mr. Healey) that it is not possible to anchor a united Germany to a European Community for ever; it will stay there only if people want it to. The horse has not yet bolted, but it is too late to lock the stable door. Our French friends must recognise that they have a choice. They can work with us and with the Germans, in which event there will be a proper balance in the Community; or they can try to exclude us, as M. Mitterrand sometimes threatens. That would mean an economic Dunkirk for us, but an economic Vichy for France.
My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister has said that matters of defence must be left to NATO and the Warsaw pact, and that was the right thing for a Head of Government to say at this time. I submit to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence, however, that the Warsaw pact is bankrupt. I do not mean that it is financially bankrupt. The great machine is there but the life has gone out of it, and eastern Europe remembers only how Warsaw pact tanks put down the cause of freedom in Berlin, Budapest and Prague.
We must make no attempt to undermine Soviet influence, or to threaten the security of the Soviet Union. It is, however, no task or business of ours to strive to keep the Warsaw pact alive.
§ Mr. Dick Douglas (Dunfermline, West)
It is always a pleasure to follow the right hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion (Mr. Amery), but I do not propose to take up many of his remarks directly. Let me first return briefly to a comment made by the hon. Member for Arundel (Mr. Marshall) about the power of communication.
To an extent, the House fails to recognise that the world is now a much smaller place, and that people are strongly influenced by what they hear on radio and see on television. The United States, for instance, might have found it easier to continue in Vietnam if the American public had not seen each night on television what was happening to their forces.
The influence of western communications on those in eastern Europe is clearly known not only to us but to Mr. Gorbachev, who is, I feel, the supreme example in the modern world of a manipulator of public relations. To my mind, his most significant speech in this regard was made 383 about a year ago, to the United Nations. He made it clear then that, in his view, the socio-political force of the idea of democratisation could not be stopped. He also made clear his understanding of the power of communication when he said:It is hardly possible to preserve, as it were, closed societies.Another member of the Politburo, Alexsandr Yakovlev, put it more succinctly:Any event becomes the property of five billion people —within hours.That is what is happening, and I think the Soviets—or, at least, the more modern members of the Politburo—understand it. What we must ask is whether this is a one-man phenomenon. What would happen if suddenly there was no Gorbachev?
The buzz words used by the Prime Minister, and by the Secretary of State today, reiterate that question, as has Mr. Gorbachev. We must argue continually for stability. Western nations are anxious not only about the stability of relations between East and West but to ensure that what is happening in eastern European countries is irreversible. How can we reconcile our desire for moves towards democracy in eastern Europe with the concept of stability? If we want stability, we will keep the Berlin wall and keep the Warsaw pact and NATO inflexible. However, if we want irreversible change we must examine clearly and carefully our response to what is happening in eastern Europe.
It is in our interest to foster two aspects of the Gorbachev doctrine. First, since 1985–86, he has propounded the view that a nuclear war could not be won. That is relatively new in Soviet thinking. How should we respond to it? Secondly, he has said that a large-scale conventional war in Europe would be almost as devastating in its consequences as a nuclear war. How should we respond to that?
The power of communication in Europe is showing clearly that the threat from the Warsaw pact countries is diminishing. That has an impact, particularly on young people and, if I may have the attention of the Secretary of State for Defence, on defence spending. If relations between eastern and western Europe are loosened and the threat of war diminished, it will be difficult for western nations to maintain previous high levels of defence spending. The United States, Mr. Cheney, and West Germany have all recognised that, and I suspect that we are beginning to recognise it in the United Kingdom.
I suspect that, behind and beneath developments in the Ministry of Defence, there is a large-scale review. That suggests, not that our defence spending will be slashed dramatically—one cannot do that without huge dislocations in industry and commerce—but that particular types of weaponry will be reconsidered. The Labour party is to pay some attention to that, and we shall state how our defence policy and posture will be affected.
Is it not a fact that certain types of weaponry—for example, the European fighter aircraft—will be called into question in a review of defence spending which takes into account the diminished threat of war? Is it not a fact that the West Germans are dragging their feet? What will be the implications for the industrial and commercial base in the United Kingdom? If I may be parochial for a few moments, what will be the implications for a company such as Ferranti? Much of our industrial and commercial manpower is tied up in defence. It is not just the hon. 384 Member for Barrow and Furness (Mr. Franks) who can allude to that. It is not possible to transfer manpower overnight without a great deal of dislocation.
The Prime Minister has said from the Dispatch Box that Mr. Gorbachev must match his words with deeds. How many more deeds can we ask him to make before we make an adequate response? The INF treaty was asymmetrical. The Soviets gave up many more weapons than we did, whether whether for good reasons or for bad ones. The START negotiations are asymmetrical too. The view that we are asking the Soviet Union to adopt and exhibit on conventional weapons reductions is asymmetrical. Its attitute to the anti-ballistic missile treaty is much more progressive than that of the United States of America. Much more dramatic was that, when it said it would withdraw from Afghanistan, it did so. Those are deeds. We must ask ourselves what deeds of ours match those of the Soviets, particularly viewed through the eyes of our young people.
Do we want to test Mr. Gorbachev? My right hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, East (Mr. Healey) put that question to the Foreign Secretary. While the new Europe emerges, it is farcical to continue to place nuclear weapons in Europe or elsewhere. The West Germans will not tolerate short-range nuclear weapons on their soil, nor being part of an Alliance that wants to modernise and introduce these weapons into their armoury. That may be difficult for many people to accept, but we cannot applaud what is happening in eastern Europe without at the same time reciprocating on the weapons at our disposal.
These are difficult matters. If we in the Labour party are against the modernisation of short-range nuclear weapons, as we are, why in the blazes is the continuation of British strategic nuclear weapons part of our policy? It does not make sense to say that we are not in favour of placing short-range nuclear weapons in Germany targeted on Warsaw and that we need much more expensive nuclear weapons at our disposal in 1994 which can be targeted on Moscow and Leningrad. If we are to ask the Government to review their defence policy and posture, we must review our own.
As the Chinese say, it is a curse to live in interesting times, but we do. We shall not live up to our responsibilities to the British people, especially our young people, if we continue to argue for stability at the same time as arguing against development which would make the process in eastern Europe irreversible.
§ Sir Geoffrey Finsberg (Hampstead and Highgate)
I hope that the hon. Member for Dunfermline, West (Mr. Douglas) will forgive me if I do not take up his interesting defence analysis immediately, but I shall take up a couple of points later. I have one comment on the speech of the right hon. Member for Leeds, East (Mr. Healey). It is a pity that nine minutes of a superb speech were ruined by his wanting to be a taproom comedian. It did the rest of his remarks no good.
I have had the privilege of leading the United Kingdom delegations to the Council of Europe and the Western European Union for the past two years. Three Europes are developing: the Community, the Council of Europe—I noticed that in a 45-minute speech the right hon. Member 385 for Manchester, Gorton (Mr. Kaufman) could not even bring himself to mention it—and the WEU. Each has its own distinct role which, in its place, is valuable.
The Community has to implement the European Single Act, to remove trade barriers, to achieve, to use that ghastly word, commonality in foreign affairs—my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary showed how successfully that was operating—as well as aligning economic affairs sensibly and working towards Delors mark I.
I was interested to read the full account of the speech by Herr Poehl, president of the Bundesbank. Today we have already heard references to what he said. He agreed with the British view that there should be a trial period of a couple of years, after all controls on capital movements were removed, before proceeding further, and that a political framework must be established before there could be a single independent European Community central bank. Those who criticise the British attitude towards the exchange rate mechanism always omit that proviso by Mr. Poehl. We have to note it carefully, because it is a practical way of considering the question.
If the Community is to succeed, which we all want, it has to find a way of exercising democratic supervision over the Commission. Earlier this week I had a most interesting conversation over lunch with Mr. Cheysson, who has had the unique experience of being both a Commissioner and Foreign Minister of France. He has said publicly on more than one occasion that we have to find a democratic way of controlling the Commission.
Perhaps one answer might be an appointed senate, consisting of Members from national Parliaments—an idea that has been floated by my right hon. Friend the Member for Henley (Mr. Heseltine). The idea is worth considering.
I have a specific question for my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence about the Western European Union. I hope that he will answer it at the end of the debate. Does he believe with me that the 1954 treaty that established the Western European Union demands that the WEU should have exclusive competence over European defence? That is a most important question. As my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary said, defence has no place in the workings of the Community. I hope that my right hon. Friend will confirm that statement.
The Hague platform, the most recent WEU declaration, was signed by Governments of all political persuasions, both Right-wing and Left-wing. Spain and Portugal are the most recent members of the WEU, and they have very different political systems. However, all WEU members agree that we need to retain the nuclear deterrent for a long time. There have, so far, been no eastern European developments that would make me wish to see any change in the Hague platform. There must be results during the conventional forces in Europe talks before we can begin to relax.
I remind those who are going hell for leather for the social charter that Mr. Delors appears to want that there is already a very good Council of Europe social charter, to which reference was made at the Rhodes summit by all the Community leaders. Why does Mr. Delors want to go 386 further than that and create his own empire? A sensible social charter is already in place to which the Community should adhere.
We are celebrating the 40th anniversary of the Council of Europe and the European convention on human rights. One of the rules governing accession to the Council of Europe is acceptance of the convention. The Council of Europe has developed into a bridge between east, central and western Europe. All 23 countries of western Europe are members of the Council of Europe. We have recently admitted Poland, Hungary, Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union as guest members. That is the way to achieve the Europe that Winston Churchill wanted: the old Europe reunited and re-created.
I take issue with my right hon. Friend the Member for Henley who, according to a report in The Guardian, wants to create a new body, consisting of the 23 nations of the Council of Europe and the countries of east and central Europe. However, I have already said that the Council of Europe has taken four nations into guest membership. I was the chairman of the committee that drew up the rules that allowed them in. They have a full right to speak in committees and in the Assembly. There is no need to create yet another body. I had the privilege of being present only a few days ago when Hungary signed the cultural convention of the Council of Europe. Many other conventions are available for signature. The sooner they are signed, the better it will be for everybody.
We have to exercise caution. I had the opportunity of talking and listening to the four guest delegations at the Council of Europe. We saw the Poles, the Hungarians, the Yugoslays and the Soviets all speak and answer questions. Every time the Soviet delegation was asked a question, it went into a huddle with a gentleman sitting at the end of the delegation. I was in the chair at that meeting and asked whether the members of the delegation could be introduced. Everyone who was there plus two who were not there were introduced but there was no mention of the chap at the end. In my usual quiet way I asked whether we could be told who the gentleman at the end in the red tie was. I was told, "He is our adviser". Alas, of the four delegations, only the Soviets had an adviser.
In contrast, I sat next to one member of the Soviet delegation at lunch. He said, "We are exercising great democratic rights in our Parliament. We have rejected six Ministers proposed by our Prime Minister." Speaking as a former Minister, I am glad that that does not happen here. That is the contrast. The Soviets are still unwilling and unable to answer questions freely, and unhappy about doing so, but they are rejecting Ministers proposed by their Prime Minister. [Interruption.]
Between that and the cacophony of sound from those who have not been here for the past three hours, it becomes possible to see where we proceed in the movement towards the bridge that we are bringing forward. That bridge is providing hope for Europe and for the tens of millions who have not enjoyed human rights for four decades. The Council of Europe provides the way forward, and I am glad that the Government are supporting it.
§ Mr. David Young (Bolton, South East)
As an officer of the all-party British-Lebanese group, on behalf of both sides of the House I wish to express my concern at the tragic events in the Lebanon.
387 I wish to discuss the insertion in the Loyal Address of mention of Hong Kong and the restoration of confidence to Hong Kong. The name of the game is how that confidence can be restored. It must be done by pushing ahead with democratic institutions and by a legislative assembly elected by full adult suffrage being in place as soon a possible. Not only must it be in place: it must be seen to be utilising its powers effectively. Equally, we must see democratic elections of the Chief Executive.
Many of us watched last summer the events in Tiananmen square. We saw a young man in front of the tanks who was waving only a handkerchief in response to the armed might of the People's Liberation Army. Yet under the agreement, that same People's Liberation Army which only a few months ago was the instrument of suppression, execution and crushing democratic expression, can he stationed in Hong Kong.
Not only myself but the people of Hong Kong feel that, if some agreement is not reached over that matter, confidence will not be restored. Because of such events, they require a fail-safe mechanism. Because they must have one, the Hong Kong people ask for British passports with the right of abode. Morally, they are equally entitled and justified in that course, as were the people in the Falklands and in Gibraltar. Of course, the counter-argument relates to numbers, not principles, but how can we argue about numbers, when nearly 1 million people in South Africa, which is not the most liberal regime in the world, can come to Britain using passports with the right of entry to and abode in Britain? The Hong Kong people are asking for passports not because they wish to reside here, but as a safety net should the provisions made by the Government prove ineffective.
Let me add one word of caution. Categories are not a solution. I do not want a system whereby the people who can get out of Hong Kong are those who can buy their way out or use influence or position to get out. In all such conflicts, it is not the rich but the poor who are penalised. However the interests of Hong Kong are also important because, if Hong Kong is to survive in its present form it will survive only as a community.
Finally, I consider that the people of Hong Kong have a justified case in asking for that concession. They ask for passports from Britain and from other countries as security, and Britain is the medium through which that should be arranged. It was rather tragic that the people of Hong Kong did not realise that what is happening to the boat people today could happen to them tomorrow. If the problem of the boat people is managed through forcible repatriation, the people of Hong Kong cannot look forward to a helpful solution should the Government's proposals not work out. They could be the stateless refugees of tomorrow.
We cannot continue saying, as the Government have done, that people should come to the West for freedom and for economic advantage, and then turn our backs on them. Imagine what would have happened had the West Germans stood by the river in Berlin all those years ago when those people swam across to freedom, and told them, "You do not really check out as a genuine refugee: swim back." Yet that is the attitude we are adopting to people who wish to come here mainly because we have suggested to them that to come to the West is the answer to their problems.
Therefore, we must see what we can do positively to help Vietnam, as we will be judged not by our words or by 388 statements in Hansard, but by our actions. We shall be judged not only on how we deal with the people of Hong Kong, but on how we deal with those who have come to us at our bidding for succour and for help. If Britain can make any claim to stand for the values to which we adhere as Members of Parliament, our duty is not to the privileged but to the disadvantaged, not only in Britain but throughout the world.
§ Mr. Cyril D. Townsend (Bexleyheath)
Today's debate is not about eastern Europe, but of course all hon. Members are mindful of the extraordinary and dramatic events that have taken place there recently. All those years ago, on a Sunday, I stood at the Brandenburg Gate as a young Army officer on the morning that the wall started to be built. Of course I remember vividly the events that followed. We watched as young men climbed the wall, threw themselves into the canal, were wounded and were left to die.
As much as any hon. Member, I rejoice that the cruel and callous regime in East Berlin has fallen. We should remember that its secret service was probably one of the most efficient and evil in the world—one only has to recall its record in Angola.
We heard an extremely poised and well-judged speech from my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs. He well explained to the country why we must react cautiously to the speed of change and keep our guard up. To produce one argument in support of that, if we decide to scrap a weapons system, it may take 10 years to re-create it, and, to follow the hon. Member for Bolton, South-East (Mr. Young), we saw how the moves for reform were so dramatically and cruelly stamped out in Tiananmen square.
I wish to make two observations on defence, neither of which will get the Secretary of State leaping up and down with joy, but perhaps it is not the job of Back Benchers to feed Ministers chocolates as though they were springer spaniels. The first is the need for a defence review. The last one was under Sir John Nott, and all hon. Members, whatever their views on defence, will agree that the situation that the Government faced at that time was entirely different. I seriously ask that consideration be given to a proper review of Britain's defence needs, against the background of the changes about which I have spoken, so that we can use our always limited resources in the best possible way.
Secondly—this point was mentioned earlier in the debate—I urge the Government to reconsider the question of short-range nuclear missiles in central Europe. Until three months ago, I thought that the defence arguments were convincing and overwhelming, but I regret that the issue was not handled with the political sensitivity that it demanded. We did not take sufficient note of German feeling. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence will know only too well that many defence experts outside the House—I am thinking particularly of the noble Lord Carrington, whose views are highly respected by Conservative Members—believe that it is not the moment to modernise those weapons. At a time of all these changes, we are thinking of introducing modernised weapons targeted on East Germany.
My brief theme is that, over the past decade, we have tilted our foreign policy to much towards the United States 389 and not enough towards West Germany and the European Community. The Prime Minister is on a visit to the United States, and I hope that it will be a great success. Some time ago she said that our relationship with America is paramount or supreme. I challenge that, because it is an out-of-date point of view. Let me make it perfectly clear that I am staunchly pro-American. I visit the United States regularly, have many American friends, and understand only too well its importance to the NATO Alliance. It supplies us with nuclear weapons, and intelligence that cannot be matched in western Europe. Yet when I consider the performance of the Reagan Administration over the past few years, I am uneasy that we were quite so close to the United States.
The concept of walking tall jarred with many of our constituents and people in Europe. I have not time to go into detail, but I had an American research assistant working for me when Grenada was invaded. When I gave her some papers, she was appalled by the gulf between the public position of the United States and the reality of what was happening. I was totally opposed to the bombing of Libya. It was a gross mistake that led to the IRA receiving its largest supply of arms ever. We learned afterwards that the White House had produced disinformation about the terrorist potential of Libya, and Britain went along with that.
The moment has come to tilt our policies towards western Europe. At Bruges, the trumpet gave an uncertain sound. There were two voices: one pro-Europe and one anti-Europe. At home and abroad it was the anti-European voice—the Little Englander voice—that was heard and the view that carried the most weight.
Our supreme task is not to kow-tow to the Bush Administration. As Mr. Charles Bremner wrote in The Times on 28 October 1989:The idea of Europe as a strong political pole is so central to the emerging Bush strategy that many would prefer Britain to exercise its transatlantic sympathies from within the new Europe, where it can counter pressure from France and others for a structure more dirigiste than London or Washington wishes. 'Thatcher should be inside the tent, fighting to marry the good points rather than standing outside pouring scorn on everyone else.The United States as a special friend—conscious of the special relationship—says, "Get in there. Fight your corner, because it is also our corner." We are foolish if we cannot grasp that basic point.
The trumpet call must be clear. Britain cannot advance its cause by narrow nationalism—by denying, thwarting and frustrating and by continuing to act like a founder member of the awkward squad. Rather, we must participate and co-operate, while fighting our corner like the French, the Germans, the Belgians and all the rest. It is through the co-operation and the co-ordination of our activities in the European Community that we shall fulfil our historic role.
§ Mr. Deputy Speaker (Sir Paul Dean)
The winding-up speeches are expected to begin at 1.50 pm, so time is very short. Many hon. Members on both sides of the House wish to speak. I therefore appeal for the continuation of short speeches.
§ Mrs. Gwyneth Dunwoody (Crewe and Nantwich)
Co-operation in the Community may be an admirable concept, but it will not be achieved if, through a combination of blind panic and blackmail, it is suggested that we can create a regime of concentric circles with Britain in the outer circle. I had hoped to hear from the Foreign Secretary some indication of the attitude that the Government propose to take at the Strasbourg summit. I am afraid that it is not at all clear at what point they will decide that they are no longer prepared to accept the diktats of those who seem increasingly to believe that the Delors plan solves all problems for the future. It is much more important that we should consider what is happening in eastern Europe and how we can help those countries to move towards democratic status in the hope that they will be prepared to enter a liaison with Europe in the future. That is important if we are not to exclude the Scandinavian countries and Austria from associate status to produce a stable political situation in middle Europe.
The House seems occasionally to underestimate the importance of the volatile situation in the middle east, which remains a significant political flashpoint. I am concerned that neither the Government nor any other international agency have put forward any proposals to resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict which take account of the fact that Israel, which is a democratic country, has the problem of persuading its voters and people to move towards a peace process and that it will do so only with encouragement from those who believe firmly in democracy and who understand the complications and complexities of the situation in the middle east.
Resolution of the Palestinian question will not enhance stability in the Arab-Israeli context unless it is supported by a comprehensive peace process. Those who tell us that the Palestine Liberation Organisation is moving rapidly towards a position where it will recognise the need for the existence of the state of Israel tend to misinterpret the signs that we have received from the PLO when it has met in conference. It was clear, even from Fatah, when it met in Tunis in August, that its main political message was that it intended… to intensify and escalate armed action and all forms of struggle to liquidate the Israel-Zionist occupation of our occupied Palestinian land and guaranteeing our people's right to freedom and independence.In Israel, both the Labour party and Mapai have made it clear that in differing ways they wish to see a movement towards an election process and the opening of political dialogue with the Palestinians and the PLO. However, they will not do so unless that process is taken one stage at a time. So that they can move towards dialogue it must involve people whom they can recognise and accept as being at least responsible politicians. It is clear that the Israeli people themselves are almost equally divided between those who do not wish to see a meeting that would give recognition to the Palestine Liberation Organisation and those who would be prepared to accept representatives who, although perhaps not directly elected, could at least demonstrate that they had the backing of the people whom they purport to represent.
The need for acceptance of an election plan is general throughout Israel. It is interpreted in different ways by different groups, but the need to find some machinery that will enable talks to begin is something that this House should support. Occasionally, we do not give sufficient 391 weight to the problems of the area in that we always highlight the abuses, which the Israelis themselves are prepared not only to investigate but to take action on. I do not defend those who commit any form of abuse against human rights, whoever they may be, and I am frequently dismayed at the fact that the real abuses in Syria, Iran and Iraq are not condemned with the vigour and clarity of expression with which Israel's problems are condemned in this House.
I continue to believe that it is vital that we give our support to those who want to see a way forward to a negotiated peace and a political settlement that will last. Israel's commitment to democracy can never be underestimated. Its people understand the need for an open expression of political views. They have a right to be untrusting of those with whom they have to talk and who are, after all, people who have carried on a violent war of terrorism against Israel for many years. If the Israeli people are wary of the movement towards talks, that is only too understandable.
If we in Britain give as much encouragement as we can to the Israelis by making it clear that we understand their reservations and the reasons behind those reservations, I believe that the Israeli people can be persuaded to move towards opening talks for elections and to find Palestinians with whom they can negotiate a proper peace for the future. I hope that very soon we shall begin to see that process opening up. As a democratic state which offers support in eastern Europe to those whom we see moving towards an elective system, and one that we support, I hope that we can also understand the problems that Israel faces in the middle east and give it the same kind of unequivocal support. As a democracy, it is seeking a solution to the problems of the middle east.
§ Mr. Nigel Forman (Carshalton and Wallington)
I welcome the paragraph in the Queen's Speech on the European Community, and the excellent speech of my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary this morning. He was right to say that this is a critical time in the development of the European Community and Europe as a whole. In those circumstances, it is crucial that Britain should be a full and positive participant in these developments.
The secret of success in the European Community, history tells us, is to adopt a constructive approach that combines British and Community interests, and it is possible to do this. For example, it is in British and Community interests to make further progress with European integration based on social market principles. This is a basis on which Left and Right in the Community can unite and, increasingly, a basis on which East and West in Europe as a whole can unite. It will mean pressing ahead with the action programme for the single market by the end of 1992. It will mean Britain joining the exchange rate mechanism as soon as that is sensible and there is a basis for it that is likely to be sustainable. It will mean accepting the principle of a social Europe to complement the economic Europe that is already so well advanced.
In this context, I was naturally glad to hear my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister say earlier this week in the debate on the Loyal Address that Her Majesty's Government are firmly in favour of parts of the social 392 charter. By implication, she was saying that if the present draft were improved in a liberal market direction, we need have no difficulty with it.
Further progress in European integration will mean that we should also promote cultural unity of the European home and use it in our schools. The national curriculum and our media. We should help to build what my right hon. Friend the Member for Guildford (Mr. Howell) called a more robust European civil society. It means that we should not feel frightened by the further developments of a political Europe. Some of my right hon. and hon. Friends seem unduly alarmed by this. They have no real need to be, and in current and future circumstances, Britain cannot afford to stand aside. Our approach should be based on reality rather than myth and on a clear-eyed appreciation of British national interests. For example, in today's interdependent world, with the rapid globalisation of markets, money and media, the old idea of national autonomy or—to adapt a phrase from another context—of conservatism in one country, is simply unattainable. There is no alternative to pooling our national sovereignties within the European Community to create a larger and more effective capacity to act at Community level. Equally, it is pointless to spend time and energy railing against the Community method, since it is clear that ad hoc alliances within the Community and even qualified majority voting can and has benefited our national interest on many occasions.
To dub everyone who favours further progress in this direction as a Euro-federalist is absurd. The Community consists of proud and distinctive nations, some of them even at the sub-national level. It is likely to develop not as a carbon copy of the United States or some other federation, but as a new political hybrid that will he suigeneris. The principle of subsidiarity will be vital in that some functions will be best exercised at national level, some at sub-national level and some at supra-national level. In removing the fears and misconceptions that cloud our European future, political leadership has a vital role.
One piece of evidence for this is the recent poll in The Independent, in which the most interesting comparison was not that between Britain, France and Germany, but that between Britain and Spain. Nearly all the British answers to the poll demonstrated the impact of our sometimes negative attitude towards some of the more adventurous Community initiatives. Nearly all the Spanish answers demonstrated precisely the reverse.
What should be our approach from now on? We should approach Community challenges in a self-confident, positive spirit. Membership is to be exploited for our legitimate national interests. We should get into the habit of helping to write the Community agenda for the future, as the French and Germans have done for years. We should explain to the British people that an effective policy in so many different sectors of European Community activity can be based only on a realistic appraisal of our national interests within the Community and how best to promote them.
We must not make mythical assumptions about our alleged national autonomy, or the supposed constitutional supremacy of this House when the reality and substance of power is flying elsewhere every day. We should come down to earth and eschew both Euro-theology and. Euro-demonology.
393 If our partners get things wrong, as they do from time to time, we should put constructive counter proposals, as the Chancellor did so ably with his evolutionary approach to European monetary union a while ago.
If we do not approach membership of the European Community in a constructive way, our partners may lose patience and go ahead without us being in the first rank beside them. That is borne out by what we know of continental public opinion and it was illustrated by answers to the recent poll in The Independent. If that happened it would be a tragic replay of too much of our post-war history, notably the events of 1950 and 1956.
I remind the House that, more than 30 years ago in May 1953, Sir Winston Churchill made a memorable speech in which he said of Britain's relationship with Europe—then it was the Six:We are with them, but not of them".That may have been an appropriate description of our relationship with the six at that time, but it would be an entirely inappropriate and damaging description of the relationship now and in the future.
I hope that my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister and my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary will go to the European Council in Strasbourg in a few weeks' time with a positive attitude and an agenda of positive points to serve British and Community interests. I hope that they will take the advice of the Daily Express leader today, which I do not have time to quote.
Splendid isolation, or a semi-detached attitude, is no longer a sensible option for Britain, nor is it a sensible definition of leadership. We should combine with our partners to construct a more prosperous and peaceful Community. That will do more than anything else to safeguard the future of the country—and the future of the Conservative party, too—in the 1990s and beyond. It will provide a political anchor for Germany and act as a powerful magnet to eastern European countries on their path to pluralism and democracy, and as a model of freedom and responsibility it can be a beacon of light to the world.
§ Mr. Nigel Spearing (Newham, South)
I am pleased to follow the hon. Member for Carlshalton and Wallington (Mr. Forman), because I could hardly disagree more. If he thinks that power will go from this place, let him fly to Strasbourg and declare himself a whole-hearted European unionist, and let him tell that to the electorate, because that is the logic of his arguments.
I celebrate the 40th anniversary of the Council of Europe. Some 40 years ago, I stayed with a German family in Hamburg as a schoolboy and I became friendly with their son. Recently he asked me why I was against the Community. I told him that, 40 years ago, we had avoided killing each other by two or three years, and that I did not want my son to put his son out of work.
The Community is not, at heart, a democratic community. It is not primarily concerned with partnership between nations or peoples. Primarily it serves the financiers and bankers. It is an economy fit for transnational companies to work in. That is why the European unionist party is well represented by Conservative Members, whether they declare it or not.
394 The European Community is more about competition than co-operation. It is more about coercion than conciliation, about profits rather than people. I challenge the suggestion made by the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington about having it national where possible and having it international where that is better. The word "subsidiarity" does not permit that. The treaty of Rome does not permit it. It is expressly designed to create a political and economic union.
I was sorry to hear the right hon. Member for Guildford (Mr. Howell), for whom I have great respect, talk widely about federation and confederation, and even advocating one. It seems that hon. Members do not understand the difference between a federation, which the European Community can never be under the treaty of Rome, and confederation, still less a political union, to which the treaty of Rome almost inevitably leads by the forces of capital and economic integration.
We forget at our peril that the difference between federation and confederation, which is not much understood even in this place, was the cause of the most disastrous civil war on the continent of north America. English-speaking people fought about that very definition.
When, as on 11 November, we remember the origin of wars, we should remember that it is in the small print of constitutions that, sometimes, such conflicts arise. I do not want there to be conflict in Europe arising out of such ideas or ancient rivalries and economic competition, which, with political aspiration, we have been told, as I believe, were the origins of the 1914–18 conflict.
I believe that we now have something of a break point in Europe. The Foreign Secretary was quite right to refer to 1848. I must refer to 1918 and 1919. Does not the elimination of the Potsdam agreement and the breaking down of the wall bring us to a situation not very different from that which confronted us with the treaty of Versailles? At that time, we had a central European power with eastern European satellites, and a great power to the east, which happened then to be in revolution. There was a settlement between the victorious western powers—the United Kingdom, France and their allies—and a vanquished Germany.
I question whether the treaty of Rome, as constituted and practised, makes a viable or proper pinpoint on which the future of a co-operative Europe can be based. The French have a phrase, point d'appuie—point of leverage—which I believe President Mitterrand put forward in Strasbourg as a major plank of his policy. I ask the House whether the treaty of Rome has not within it some of the seeds of failure of the treaty of Versailles?
Politicians in a hurry rightly want to secure a peaceful future for Europe, but can one be obtained with a flawed constitution which denies national self-expression, which denies countries such as ours the power of this Parliament, and which, in respect of national taxation and the balance between public ownership and private endeavour, gives the United Kingdom a lower constitutional status than is aspired to, and will probably be gained by Estonia and Latvia?
I put it to Conservative Members, especially those who believe in a European mush—that is what many of them are advocating—that if we want peace, good will and stability in Europe, as do I, my friends and our grandchildren, we must build it on a sure foundation, and I do not see that foundation in the treaty of Rome.
§ Sir Rhodes Boyson (Brent, North)
I always try to speak on the debate on the Address because it provides an opportunity to range widely, but apart from some comments at the end of my contribution I shall confine myself to foreign policy, especially European policy.
I still think, however, that too many Bills are featured in each Session's Queen's Speech. Hon. Members on both sides of the House spend far too much time passing through the Lobbies in support of or in opposition to Bills that we have to rewrite the following year. That happens year after year. We should have more debates on major issues both here and abroad so that we get the direction right before we introduce the Bill.
I think that we are all agreed that the lid has come off middle and eastern Europe. We are confronted with a Pandora's box, or a box of honey—it will be one or the other. What Britain does and what other countries do will be decisive for the future of Europe in our own, our children's and our grandchildren's lifetime. It is vital that we have every link possible with middle and eastern Europe.
I recently returned from Hungary, where it was clear to me that the Hungarians do not regard themselves as part of eastern Europe. They see themselves as being in middle Europe. The best way to lose friends immediately in Hungary is to refer to the Hungarians as eastern Europeans. Anyone who does that might as well get straight back on the aeroplane and return to the United Kingdom. You always expect me to produce one good quote, Mr. Deputy Speaker, and I have done so at the beginning of my speech.
In middle Europe generally the star is rising in the west. For a long time the middle European countries looked to the East, but they realise now that the East's economic system has not worked and they want to be back with the West. We have a chance to revitalise European civilisation. That goes beyond the Common Market.
The tragedy of this century was the first world war, when Europe destroyed so much of its culture and aspirations as a result of dividing itself. We now have a chance to bring Europe together. The economics must be sound, but basically this is not an economic issue. The countries of middle Europe want to be in Europe and to be back with us in the West.
When I was in Hungary I did not make the number of visits that the right hon. Member for Manchester, Gorton (Mr. Kaufman) described when he spoke from the Opposition Front Bench this morning. It seems that he went everywhere and saw everyone. I was privileged, however, to meet the leaders of the political parties and Hungary's Foreign Minister. It is clear that they are all concerned that Hungary should return to Europe. I welcome the fact that the Hungarians have presented their culture at the Barbican centre—indeed, I attended the ballet there, as did many other hon. Members—as part of the community of Europe. The Hungarian company presented ballets from the West—it did not confine itself to middle European productions. The Prime Minister of Hungary is coming here next month. He is a Harvard graduate and he knows the West. He is young and his record within the Communist party has been that of a reformer throughout. Next year, Prince Charles and Princess Diana will visit Hungary.
396 As others have said, there should be a form of Marshall plan to help Hungary and other middle European countries economically. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Guildford (Mr. Howell) said, without that support the Hungarians may have a difficult economic time as they try to straighten their economy. The West faces a great liability, and I would bring in America to stand alongside us, with most of the English-speaking world, so that Hungary can return once more to European values.
I note that I am trapped, as it were, between my hon. Friends the Members for Bexleyheath (Mr. Townsend) and for Carshalton (Mr. Forman). I do not think that that is the result of a plot. Both are men of great integrity and I listen to their views. I am concerned about the values of European civilisation, and I do not doubt that my hon. Friends share that concern. I have respect for the individual and the Judaeo-Christian tradition. I hope that we can build upon it. I am concerned especially that there should be a free society which upholds the values of the individual and the mixed economy.
I was not a Member of this place when it was decided that the United Kingdom should be a member of the EEC, but I voted subsequently as an agnostic pro in favour of membership. I still see the EEC as a market. I disagree with those of my hon. Friends who say otherwise, and I understand that I shall probably have to go into perdition for a time for making that admission. I do not like the social market and I do not want any form of political link. I want a free economic market. I realise that I am in trouble for holding that view, but I have not worked out where it will take me.
I am not a federalist. After all, man is a tribal animal. We cannot have intellectual levitators deciding what we are to do. I would not for a moment consider my hon. Friends who sit either side of me to be intellectual levitators. They could make a fortune at a circus if they were. Indeed, they could do so in the House now that we have television cameras in the Chamber. Imagine the spectacle of political levitation shown live on the television screen! We must never forget that we are tribal animals. Russia is beginning to discover that fact as nationalism spreads, especially in such places as Estonia. It is certainly true of Europe and of bodies such as the Scottish National party and Plaid Cymru. People like to belong to small groups.
I must mention the problems of football hooliganism and the introduction of identity cards. Many football hooligans are just frustrated people with nothing to believe in. They wrap themselves in the Union Jack and disgrace it. They have lost their sense of identity. We must accept that though we are Europeans, with European civilisation, we still belong to smaller tribes. The marriage of those two will be as important politically as any other factor in our future. If we forget that fact, there is a danger that the system will break down.
I want to make three sharp comments, or perhaps I should refer to them as acute points. They relate to three matters that I wish had been included in the Queen's Speech. Every year, when the Gracious Speech states:Other measures will be laid before youI have great faith that somewhere among those will be the measures that I want. They have not materalised yet, but they must be somewhere, waiting to come out. I shall watch week by week, in the hope that they will arrive.
397 First, we need a more controlled planning law which is on the side of the residents and not the developers. That is a non-party point, so I appeal for a little assistance from the Opposition. [HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear."] The developer can appeal if he does not get his way, but the residents whose lives are about to be destroyed have no right of appeal. That is against natural justice—[Interruption.] In my constituency good houses are being knocked down and replaced by tiny flats—the dolls' house society. There are no gardens—it is also a window box society. Is that progress in this green age? [HON. MEMBERS: "No."] I am glad to have such support. The feelings of the House are with me. We need legislation that will free the individual to protect his environment.
Secondly, I must mention the community charge, which I know is dear to many hearts, but not so dear to many others. The Government have not gone far enough on the question of low-rated houses and I regret that there was no mention of that in the Gracious Speech. The safety net should be lifted next April, not the following year. If it is not, it will be like having a cyanide pill. That is painful, as anybody who has tried it will know, because he would not be here today—[HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear."] I am glad that hon. Members are still with me.
With my third point, I may win if not universal approval—I would never desire that—at least some support. Something must be done about the London Underground. [HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear."] Again, the House is with me. The way the Underground is run is neither Socialism nor privatisation. It seems to be run by people in outer space. Certainly, we can never find them. I do not really mind whether the Underground is privatised—although I should probably prefer that—or socialised, but somebody will have to run it. At present, there is nobody in charge. People in my constituency—
§ Mr. Tony Banks (Newham, North-West)
And mine.
§ Sir Rhodes Boyson
If the hon. Gentleman sees people writing on the tube, he will know that they come from my constituency. They write to me every week. The average delay on the Metropolitan line into London is six minutes on every journey. As the delay varies from one minute to 30 minutes, my constituents have to leave home 20 or 30 minutes early in case the train is late. It has reached the stage where, because people can no longer tell when they are likely to arrive, my constituents have turned to taking sandwiches on their journeys. This week, the guards have been taken off the Bakerloo line, as though it were the safest in London. Staff shortages have already led to tramps sleeping in the Underground and people selling lavender there. It is like going back to the 19th century.
§ Mr. Jeremy Corbyn (Islington, North)
Will the right hon. Gentleman give way?
§ Sir Rhodes Boyson
No, but I will give a re-run of my speech some time.
Our capital city deserves a first-class Underground service. The £1 billion being spent on the Jubilee line is petty cash by comparison with the total investment that is required if trains are to run punctually and if the travelling public are to arrive for work on time. That investment must come either from the Underground system being privatised or from it being socialised. It cannot go on as it 398 is. [HON. MEMBERS: "Socialise it!"] Like many other right hon. and hon. Members, I maintain close contacts with Hungary, which was only the second country after our own to construct an Underground system. Although I have not yet travelled on it, I shall do so next time I visit Hungary. If it is better than ours, perhaps the Hungarians can provide us with assistance in the running of our own system, in exchange for some of the overseas aid that we give them.
§ Mr. David Steel (Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale)
I have a suspicion that the Secretary of State for Defence will feel inhibited in responding to the last three points made by his right hon. Friend the Member for Brent, North (Sir R. Boyson). I shall do so on his behalf. I wholly agree that restrictions are needed on developments in the south, but if they are to be effective there need to be regional policies for the north and for Scotland. The right hon. Gentleman was right also to condemn the poll tax. Speaking as a Scottish Member of Parliament, I can tell right hon. and hon. Members representing English and Welsh constituencies that they do not know yet what will hit them next April. I agree also with the right hon. Gentleman's plea for greater public expenditure on the London Underground. If the Minister replying were not the Secretary of State for Defence, I am sure that he would have agreed with all three propositions also.
I wish the new Foreign Secretary well in his third incarnation, in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Without wishing to repeat points effectively made in earlier speeches, I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will be successful in re-establishing the robust role of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and of the Cabinet in directing the nation's foreign policy.
For the first time in many years, the debate on the Loyal Address has been held against a background of new hope and fluidity in world affairs. My only complaint about the Gracious Speech is that it does not come near to capturing that spirit. Apart from the phrase "remarkable changes", one would have thought that the world was going on as before. The Gracious Speech gives the solemn assurance that the Government will maintain "adequate and effective" defence. So I should hope.
Many right hon. and hon. Members have reminisced about the Berlin wall. I remember being taken, as a young Member of Parliament, to the top of the post office tower in East Berlin and seeing from that height the ghastly concrete snake that divided the city. I shared in the general sense of excitement and relief when the wall was torn down. However, we must admit that the speed of change has taken us all somewhat aback. Only six months ago, like the right hon. Member for Brent, North, I was in Hungary having talks with the emerging democratic opposition parties with colleagues from Liberal International. At the time, we were talking of greater freedoms in the context only of Hungary and Poland, yet already we have seen East Germany, Bulgaria and now, we hope, Czechoslovakia, choosing the path of reform.
Only two months ago, my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Fife, North-East (Mr. Campbell) and I made a short visit to Bulgaria to meet members of the Agrarian party. When we returned, we were not believed when we reported that in our conversations with President Zhivkov, he had said that he would probably retire in one year. No 399 one in the press seemed interested, because it seemed improbable that, after 35 years, he would be relinquishing power. He has gone faster than I expected, and probably faster than he imagined as well. Authoritarian leaders can no longer dictate their own political longevity—not even through interviews in The Times.
How should we respond to this mood of change? I believe that President Bush and the new Administration in the United States have reacted correctly—in a calm but positive way, talking sensibly about United States force reductions in Europe. It is the convinced view of Liberal Democrats in the House that NATO and the Warsaw pact should themselves be used as the instruments for balanced and carefully controlled disarmament.
I took a rather optimistic view of what the Foreign Secretary said earlier about the modernisation of short-range nuclear weapons. Reading between the lines, I understood him to say that, while that issue was certainly dead, it was not yet formally buried. I hope that that is indeed the position.
In the long run, we should be looking towards a Europe free of the presence of the super-powers, in which we can contemplate the eventual orderly replacement of those two great organisations with a united, pan-European common security agreement. That time, however, is some way off. Those who fear the might of a future united Germany should, in my view, be the first to press for it to be firmly embraced within a genuine European economic and political community. We are right to be on our guard against a revival of old European nationalisms, but we cannot be on our guard if the prevailing wind from Downing street carries siren voices of ultra-British nationalism across the Channel to our partners in Europe, who are trying to extend civil democracy to a European level.
As we shall be discussing eastern Europe next week, I do not wish to continue with this theme for too long today. Let me, however, ask the Government to be optimistic rather than pessimistic. I have been rather concerned by the misuse of the word "destabilise" in public debate over the past few weeks. For half a century, hundreds of thousands of Soviet and American troops have been in Europe, bristling with conventional and nuclear weaponry, and a concrete wall has divided one of our great European cities. That is indeed a perverted definition of stability. We must hope that the current flux leads to a more ordered and less tense Europe, leaving the super-powers with resources to devote to far better purposes in the world.
While we should certainly welcome the spread of freedom and liberal democracy throughout the world, let us ensure in our own foreign policy that our definition of freedom is not selective. Some elements of our recent foreign policy can scarcely be said to have enhanced our espousal of those virtues. There is, for instance, our extraordinary stance on Cambodia, about which the House has already expressed its deep unease. There is the cruel treatment of the Vietnamese boat people in Hong Kong, graphically described by my right hon. Friend the Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown) on the first day of this debate. After the murder by death squads of six Jesuit priests in El Salvador this week, I hope that the Conservative party will perhaps be rather more fastidious about whom it welcomes to its gatherings.
I hope that the global effect of the easing of East-West relations will lead to a more determined effort to solve the 400 long-standing regional conflicts in the world. In the middle east, the second assassination of a Lebanese president in recent years has again set back the tentative approach on the road to peace, and the now more conciliatory attitude of the PLO leadership has not yet met with an adequate response from Israel. I hope that our Government, together with the super-powers, will use all their efforts to secure the long-awaited peace conference on the middle east.
Let me conclude by concentrating on a specific regional problem on which I believe that the process of East-West improvement has already had a major impact. I refer to southern Africa, from which I returned last week. The Cubans are already moving out of Angola, faster than was arranged under the United Nations agreement, and under the new regime I think that the East Germans are bound to follow suit. The South African Government can no longer be obsessed by the fear of Reds under the beds and creeping Communism across Africa; indeed, by harping on over the years, they have done more than anyone else to promote Marxism among their people. In my experience, people in the townships know little about Communism except that it is declared to be on their side.
When I was in South Africa, I had the extraordinary experience of hearing on the BBC overseas service, on which I was dependent for a fortnight for news—I hope that the Foreign Secretary will resist further Treasury pressure against that excellent service—the early speeches of Mr. Egon Krenz made about three weeks ago, in which he spoke about the reforms that he intended to introduce in East Germany. One such reform was a civilian option instead of military service. It was strange to listen to that speech in South Africa, where young Jews and Christians are locked up for six years for refusing to do military service. Suddenly, the detested East German regime seemed more liberal than the South African one.
The mood of change in South Africa since the elections is substantial and genuine. Since my previous visit three years ago, I found in discussions with officials, representatives, and those voicing black opinion a fundamentally different mood. One MP of the ruling party said:We know what we have to do. It is only a question of how long it takes us to do it.That is a remarkable change from the attitudes of previous South African regimes.
I hope that the settlement in Namibia will have a good effect on South Africa. The composition of the new constituent Assembly ensures that there will be a multi-party approach to writing the constitution. Together with others, I visited Namibia during the elections. We should pay a heartfelt tribute to UNCTAD and to the many British local government election officers who participated in making the elections a success. We should also pay tribute to groups such as the Royal Corps of Signals, which provided a basic network of communication throughout the election process.
Above all, our tributes and admiration must go to the 96 per cent. of Namibian people who turned out to exercise the right to vote in the most trying conditions. I met people who had walked for miles through the night to reach the polling stations, only to stand in the blistering heat all day and be turned away because there were not enough polling stations and told to come back the next day. It is extraordinary that they have such determination to use the democratic process after 20 years of bloody strife.
401 The hon. Member for Swansea, East (Mr. Anderson) and I attended a meeting where a pastor of the Congregational Church detailed the cruelties and iniquities inflicted on him and his black friends when they were children. He said that, at the age of 56 he would go into a polling booth for the first time and use his cross as a cross of hope, reconciliation and faith. That demonstrated a completely new spirit in the country, which I hope will spread from Namibia to South Africa.
The Foreign Office must be vigilant in two matters that affect the future of Namibia. The first is the stranglehold of debt which the South African regime maintains over the new emerging country. The second is their retention of the Walvis bay port. I hope that the Government will respond vigorously on those matters.
I also hope that they will respond to the requests from the new Government in Namibia for specific help of a type that we are uniquely placed to give. We can help in training the police and military, in developing the English language—which has been chosen as the official language even though Afrikaans and German are just as predominant in Namibia—and in training in the Civil Service, where promotion for blacks has hitherto been blocked beyond a certain point. In those three areas, we should give direct and committed help.
The climate in South Africa has been improved by the release of detainees and by the remarkable and peaceful success of that great rally in Johannesburg organised by the ANC. I visited Walter Sisulu in his house in Soweto, and I found a man remarkably lacking in bitterness after 26 years of detention. The Government should lift the ban on Ministers meeting representatives of the ANC. Now that South African Ministers and business meet them, there can be no case for maintaining that objection.
There is a mood of expectancy that Nelson Mandela will be released, possibly at Christmas. I hope that that will happen. Equally, I hope that the Prime Minister will not mistake his release for the single most important event in South Africa. Those pressing for his release made it clear to me that more important than that, as Nelson Mandela would agree, would be the lifting of the emergency, the re-creation of a free press, the release of all detainees, the permission for exiles to return, the unbanning of political organisations and the creation of normal political activity. Only then should the Prime Minister contemplate a visit. Even when all that has been done, we shall merely return to normal apartheid. The Group Areas Act and the Population Registration Act will still exist; until they are repealed, one cannot see progress to ordinary constitutional change.
We must maintain selective international pressure. It has worked, and this is not the time to back off. In her speech on the first day of the Loyal Address, the Prime Minister proudly referred to the old order before her Government being replaced by onebased on merit, ability and effort."—[Official Report, 21 November 1989; Vol. 162, c. 24.]I have never doubted those qualities in the Prime Minister, but the international order requires greater vision than that. I should like us to promote genuine freedom and greater economic and social justice, and to offer help and protection to the weak and dispossessed. When we consider the remaining regional conflicts—southern Africa, the middle east and central America—we must 402 hope that in the 1990s the shadow that has lain so long over the United Nations Organisation will be lifted and that in our future foreign policy it will be possible for that organisation to play a much more effective role in global affairs.
§ Mr. Martin J. O'Neill (Clackmannon)
Despite the sparse attendance on the Benches, we have had a good, wide-ranging debate. To paraphrase Mark Twain, the news of the retirement of my right hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, East (Mr. Healey) has been exaggerated. He will be here to give us advice and chastise us at every opportunity until the general election. Although many of us hope that that general election will be called as soon as possible, we shall be happy to hear my right hon. Friend for some time to come.
It is correct to spend some time on national and western security when the Gracious Speech has that as its highest priority, although in recent weeks we have had several debates on foreign affairs, not least because of the rapid pace of change in eastern Europe. Only a few weeks ago in the middle of the defence estimates debate we heard the announcement of the retirement, or sacking, of Herr Honecker, the East German head of state. Since then we have seen many exciting changes and it is right for us to be preoccupied with their many consequences.
It would be remiss not to pay tribute to the recent victims of terrorist attacks—the murder of Corporal Islania and his six-month-old daughter on 26 October, the thankfully unsuccessful car bombing of Lieutenant-General Sir David Ramsbotham on 14 November, the dreadful murder of the three members of the Parachute regiment at Mayobridge in Northern Ireland on 18 November and, more recently, the attempted murder of Staff Sergeant Mudd and his wife at Colchester. Those incidents shocked everybody by their frequency and the ease with which security can be penetrated to take unaware people whose life work has been devoted to ensuring vigilance. The Secretary of State will not wish to comment on the example raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Stockton, North (Mr. Cook), but I hope that with his usual vigour he will pursue the matter. The events at Deal have made the public far more aware of security lapses and have alerted everybody to the seriousness of the problem.
To return to the happier and exciting events in central Europe, pluralism and democracy have emerged in amazing ways within a relatively short period. The promotion of pluralism and democracy is one of the best ways to guarantee western, eastern and central European security. One could almost add Bulgaria to that list. Moreover, the popular feeling that is emerging in Czechoslovakia will, I hope, shortly enable us to include that country on the list. As soon as it is appropriate, I hope that the Foreign Secretary will provide assistance to the brave Czechs and Slovaks in their struggle for social and political reconstruction.
One of the most obvious ways to promote social and political reconstruction is to secure an orderly reduction in the forces of the Alliance and the Warsaw pact. That would reduce the burden of arms expenditure and it would also help to erode the already diminishing distrust and fear on both sides.
The Federal Republic of Germany and the United States are contributing most of the financial assistance. 403 With characteristic generosity, the West Germans have responded by providing £1.1 billion in Government loans for investment by German firms in Poland. That was reported in The Independent on 14 November. West Germany's altruism is not totally devoid of self-interest. When I was in Warsaw last week I was told that of 600 contracts that had been signed between the Polish authorities and foreign countries, about 250 were with German companies. It is little wonder that the concern expressed in Poland about the events in the German Democratic Republic was not about German revanchism but about West Germany's industrial investment being deflected to the GDR. I suspect that the Poles are over-anxious. The Federal Republic of Germany has long been actively involved in the GDR's economy. The breaking down of the wall will facilitate but will not necessarily encourage a new wave of investment in that area.
The only serious concern about German revanchism was expressed by the hard-liners in the now-dying Polish Communist party. Everybody else was relaxed and self-confident. They felt that the changes in the GDR need not necessarily affect their western boundaries. That view was expressed by members of all political parties and by members of the political establishment.
I am optimistic about the news that the United States has responded generously to Poland's request for aid, but it is depressing to find that the sums which the British Government intend to provide to Poland amount to only £25 million to be invested in a know-how fund. They have also promised that they will contribute European Community initiatives.
When I was in Poland I met an official of the House, who was giving advice to his Polish counterparts on how we conduct our affairs. I hope that he will report to the authorities and the appropriate Committee on the Polish experience in televising their proceedings. It seems to be far more extensive and exciting than our own.
It is essential that we give encouragement and sustenance to the fragile democratic party institutions in eastern Europe, but it is far more important to play our part in helping their economies out of the chaos and neglect that are the result of 40 years of Stalinism. If our economy is not sufficiently strong to make a contribution comparable with that of the Federal Republic, we should at least back West Germany in its approach to the security problems of central Europe. No one, apart from the Prime Minister, appears to believe that there is the slightest possibility of a follow-on to Lance. Anyone who supports the continued existence of short-range nuclear forces beyond the CFE process must be mad.
In Germany the old slogan used by people opposed to those forces was "The shorter the range the deader the German". The new slogan must be, "The shorter the range, the deader the shopper". It is clear that the Soviets will want to stick to the agreed timetable for the removal of those weapons. Our objective should be to march in step with them. That must not mean that the CFE talks in Vienna are seen as a barrier to further initiatives. When the comprehensive concept was agreed and the NATO summit took place, hardly any of the advances and improvements which we have been celebrating were in any way certain or properly evident. Therefore, it is essential that we are as flexible as possible in our approach to the talks on conventional forces in Europe.
404 I can understand Secretary of Defence Cheney seizing the opportunities offered by recent improvements to increase the search for cuts in his budget. As he seeks to secure those cuts, so should we. My hon. Friend the Member for Dunfermline, West (Mr. Douglas) questioned the validity of the Labour party carrying on with a successor to Polaris. Before the general election he disagreed with Labour party policy on nuclear disarmament. Now that we have responded to the new challenges offered by negotiated disarmament he again disagrees. He was wrong before the election and he is wrong now.
§ Mr. Douglas
That is a lie.
§ Mr. O'Neill
If my hon. Friend withdraws his comment I shall give way.
§ Mr. Douglas
Let me put it this way. That is a terrible distortion of the position that I took in 1987. I agreed with our policy in 1987 and I continue to take that stance now. That is where I disagree with my hon. Friend the Member for Clackmannan (Mr. O'Neill). He should not use his position at the Dispatch Box to perpetrate a falsehood about a colleague without first giving him notice.
§ Mr. O'Neill
For reasons which I shall not go into, I could not make a comment of that nature in the previous defence debate. As my hon. Friend repeated it this morning, I thought it appropriate for me to handle it in the correct way. I have now done so.
§ Mr. Douglas
Withdraw.
§ Mr. O'Neill
I do not wish to withdraw the remark as I do not think that it is necessary.
I and many other Opposition Members believe that cuts in defence expenditure are attractive. They are something that we would wish to secure in the most orderly manner possible. That was agreed on both sides of the House.
Although cuts are attractive, they do not enhance stability. Even parity at lower levels does not necessarily enhance stability. By stability, I do not mean rigidity, but the absence, or means of securing the absence, of tension. We should look to the constructive message contained in President Bush's speech last Wednesday. He said that the idea of containment was becoming sterile and increasingly irrelevant and has been replaced by the need to establish a new European security order based on the principles that were first considered by the Palme commission—the concept of common security. We can start the process of building on the exchanges taking place between NATO and Warsaw pact officers under the confidence-building measures. I welcome the visit of General Sir Richard Vincent, the vice chief of defence staff to the Soviet Union and wish him every success in his discussions.
The talks in Vienna on military doctrine are due to start early in the new year. It has been suggested that they have only academic significance, but we would be missing a tremendous opportunity if we did not talk far more seriously. Given the encouragement of President Bush's remarks this week, we should enter the talks looking for means to establish a new security order in Europe. If we reduce or thin out our forces, we call into question the concept of forward defence and force to space ratios.
The desire of the United States and the Federal Republic to proceed with a second phase of CFE will not 405 be satisfied by the intellectual and somewhat abstract challenges of qualitative changes in weapons systems. There has to be far more on the agenda.
One of the most depressing aspects of the Foreign Secretary's speech, with which I agreed in considerable part, was the absence of any groping towards a new security order in Europe. It may be in the speech of the Secretary of State for Defence, but I have heard the right hon. Gentleman speak on the matter before and he passes over it with exceeding speed. In an interview on Radio 4 last Friday lunchtime, he certainly presented no prospect of fresh thinking. Of course, it is not mentioned in the Queen's Speech, but it certainly should be included in the Secretary of State's speech today. Obviously, we want him to tell us what he is considering as a follow-on to Lance.
We know that there are prospects for talks on the removal or reduction of short-range nuclear forces in Europe as part of the CFE process. We must now consider whether the Government are still prepared to breathe oxygen into the corpse of the follow-on to Lance. If they are, it would appear that they are alone in Europe. No one in Germany or America and none of the other allies seems to be interested in that project.
The talks on defence cuts which followed the interviews given by Defence Secretary Cheney at the weekend may be somewhat confusing to hon. Members. They certainly are to me because the figures that he has suggested and the parts of the defence budget that he may cut do not necessarily have a direct impact on Europe. A number of the cuts which Mr. Gorbachev has announced in the past 12 months will take considerable time to achieve. The demobilisation of 125,000 Soviet officers will require their relocation to civvy street and finding them accommodation of a standard to which they have been accustomed during their military service. Those potentially dislocating problems will be repeated across the Warsaw pact countries, and are a very different set of military problems from those that would be encountered by a volunteer Army such as ours as a result of arms cuts.
We have to recognise that in the early stages, when we are still debating CFE, there will have to be a major change of doctrine and a major review of British commitments to the defence budget. The International Institute for Strategic Studies report on the military balance has now been accepted by everyone. There is no prospect of a surprise attack from the east. There is little prospect of such an attack succeeding through any of the countries that have been mentioned this morning. Therefore, we have to look to new, less provocative forms of deployment and equipment. To do that we need to consider questions such as force specialisation and restructuring. We also have to consider our own defence budget.
It is not the easiest task quickly to make rational cuts to the defence budget. We have had a series of defence cuts through a process of review by stealth; a layer of skin has been taken off the body each year. That cannot carry on if the health of our contribution to the Alliance is to be sustained. We must consider a process of dismemberment and restructuring, which will involve the co-operation of and consultation with several of our allies.
The Government have singularly failed to address that task. That isolation from the debate within the Alliance and from the general debate on how we can most 406 effectively take advantage of the changing circumstances in Europe, how we can work within the Alliance to create a new security order, the Prime Minister's unwillingness to consider it and the manner in which she skated over it, are perhaps the most depressing aspects of Government defence policy.
Everyone in this country is looking for fulfilment from the Secretary of State. We hope for a clear sign of the direction that defence expenditure will take at a time when we are grossly overcommitted in areas where we need no longer be, when we are isolated within the Alliance on short-range nuclear forces and when we have a Government who do not believe that changes in defence and security east of the Berlin wall will be permanent or will make a contribution to European security.
§ The Secretary of State for Defence (Mr. Tom King)
It is a great privilege to have the opportunity to wind up the debate, which was so wisely opened by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs. The House thought that he made a most impressive first speech as Foreign Secretary. I suggested to him that next year we might have a defence and foreign affairs debate and reverse our roles, but I must accept that, whereas perhaps a little while ago arms reduction issues were driving political considerations forward, there is no question currently but that political developments are driving on developments in arms negotiations.
I shall try to reply to the considerable number of points that have been made, but I shall not be able to reply to all the points made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Brent, North (Sir R. Boyson). Some are for me and some are for the Whips or anyone who would care to join in, but I know that his comments on a wide range of subjects will have been noted.
The Gracious Speech emphasised the importance that the Government attach to the maintenance of defence and our membership of NATO. Pretty standard words appear in different forms in most Gracious Speeches, but this year they have true meaning. The hon. Member for Dunfermline, West (Mr. Douglas) quoted the Chinese proverb that it is a curse to live in interesting times, and no one doubts that we are currently doing so.
Throughout, there has been a serious tone to the debate; not a tone of certainty from the right hon. Member for Leeds, East (Mr. Healey) and my right hon. Friend the Member for Brighton, Pavilion (Mr. Amery)—who both remembered some of the history from which the present position is emerging, and said what some of the implications of that may be—but a sombre tone, because they recognised that, while there is excitement about and manifest hope, which we all feel, for the developments, there is a worry that things may not go as we should wish.
I was impressed by a remark made by my right hon. Friend about not only the courage but the wisdom of people in eastern Europe in so much of the way in which they are responding to change. He sensed the mood of the House in that. We had a defence debate not long ago and I have been thinking today how many things have happened since that time, when I believe Mr. Honecker was still in charge. The Berlin wall has been breached and 407 there has been a massive movement of East Germans and we now understand that Mr. Honecker is to face investigation, if not trial, by the new authorities.
At the time of that defence debate, only Hungary and Poland were on the move. Since then they have been joined by East Germany, even Bulgaria and now Czechoslovakia. Hon. Members may have seen the photographs taken last night in Wenceslas square. I could not see an inch of free ground in that amazing picture. Only last Sunday, half a million people gathered in Riga in Latvia to celebrate their national day—a further sign that that empire is under threat, as the right hon. Member for Leeds, East suggested.
We come to this foreign affairs debate mindful not only of events in eastern Europe but of the fact that the situation in many other parts of the world is not normal. The right hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale (Mr. Steel) referred to southern Africa. Areas that have seemed immobile for so long are now dramatically on the move.
Of keen interest to the House is the situation in Hong Kong. My right hon. Friend the Member for Guildford (Mr. Howell), who explained to me that he could not be here for the winding-up speeches, rightly said that we shall shortly have our last chance, given the impending final session of the Basic Law drafting committee, to decide the position that the Government should take vis-a-vis the Chinese view of democratisation in Hong Kong. We are conscious of our responsibility to do all that we can to ensure that the provisions of the Basic Law accord fully with the terms of the joint declaration.
We are aware that, in that context, the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs has recommended the introduction of full direct elections before 1997. The Committee also recommended that it is for the people of Hong Kong to decide their system of government. We must therefore await the outcome of the current debate in Hong Kong, but it is clear that our main objective must be to ensure that the system of democratic government in Hong Kong is well established and can last through and beyond 1997.
I understand that the right hon. Member for Manchester, Gorton (Mr. Kaufman) is also unable to be here. At least the right hon. Member for Leeds, East spoke his own words and did not shower us with a cascade of press cuttings such as that inflicted on us by the right hon. Member for Gorton. My right hon. Friend the Member for Guildford summed him up well: the right hon. Member for Gorton made it absolutely clear that if one is in a minority, one must just give in and immediately accept the majority view. As the Government of the country, we must do what is right; it does not matter whether we are in a minority or not. As Secretary of State for Employment, I have been a minority of one in the Council of Ministers on some of the issues that are now coming back round the circuit as we debate the social charter. I argued my case and in the end we had a majority because those who had not studied the issues but who were not in favour of Socialist proposals coming up through the Commission realised the danger. I make no apologies if on occasion we fight our corner for what we believe is right for Britain.
The right hon. Member for Leeds, East referred to his obituary. I have no doubt that we shall have quite a few valedictory addresses before he goes and that this is not the last that we shall hear of him. I shall deal a little later with his remarks about European developments.
408 My hon. Friend the Member for Hampstead and Highgate (Sir G. Finsberg) referred to the importance of the Western European Union. The whole House knows of the leading role that my hon. Friend plays in the WEU and of the importance that the Government attach to that institution. The WEU has an essential part to play in European defence co-operation. We are cautious about developing any defence role for the European community, at least at this stage. We have more pressing priorities and we have, at the moment, a sure and reliable defence in NATO. That is where we stand on the specific point put to me.
My hon. Friend the Member for Hampstead and Highgate also referred most interestingly to the opportunities that my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary held out for the enlargement of the Council of Europe and for ways in which it could spread. I believe that he referred to an association and to a cultural agreement being signed. I think that we are all conscious of what has been happening in the Barbican recently. Picking up a point made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Brent, North, who referred to Hungary as a "European country", which it certainly is, we have been privileged to hear and to see Hungarian music and culture recently in London. That is a welcome addition and a reawakening of an element of European culture.
My hon. Friend the Member for Arundel (Mr. Marshall) drew attention to the important role of the Inter-Parliamentary Union. He was right to say how valuable it was that, during Mr. Gorbachev's visit in 1984, it was the IPU that provided an opportunity that might not have been so easily achieved through various other channels at the time. I am sure that all hon. Members believe in the importance of developing links between elected Members in all the countries of eastern Europe as they strive to embrace democracy and in the need for close contact with them.
The hon. Member for Stockton, North (Mr. Cook) made certain allegations about what, on the face of what he said, appeared extremely serious lapses in security at the Wellington barracks. I should be grateful if the hon. Gentleman would let me have the full details, because the Army authorities will obviously wish to investigate fully. He also raised the issue of the use of dependants as security guards at military bases. I am not aware of any such use and there are no such plans at present. However, the way in which the hon. Gentleman presented his case might give some offence to many families and dependants in West Germany who are with the Army and the services. Anybody who goes to Germany is struck at present—[Interruption.] Well, I must say this bluntly, and the hon. Gentleman will know what I mean.
People are struck by the fact that the services in West Germany face an evil threat. There have recently been murders that have shocked the House. As so often happens in such cases, one is struck by the way in which the services come together, not in fear but in shared determination. I have been hugely impressed by wives and grown-up children saying, "We want to do anything that we can to play our part." If there is a role here for, say, a neighbourhood watch, or for some other means by which people who want to play a part can do so to ensure that evil men do not succeed, and if people can provide greater security for their communities, I welcome that. However, 409 I understand what the hon. Gentleman said, and I have given him a clear answer to the specific point that he raised.
I thank the hon. Member for Clackmannan (Mr. O'Neill) for what he said about security issues. Although we are talking about big global matters and the developments in eastern Europe, at the same time we and the services face evil and vicious security attacks. The past week has seen the tragedies to which he referred. The whole House stands together in the etermination—[Interruption.] No, we do not seek to exploit it. It is a serious situation and a lot of people face real problems and threats.
§ Mr. Dennis Skinner (Bolsover)
The Army is being put in danger.
§ Mr. King
Nor is this something about which hon. Members should heckle. The House stands in a responsible—
§ Mr. Skinner
Will the Secretary of State give way?
§ Mr. King
No, I shall not give way to the hon. Gentleman, because he has not been present throughout the debate and I am talking on a matter about which I believe hon. Members overwhelmingly stand together with the security forces on the need to resist terrorists in that way.
The hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody) made a moving and eloquent plea for a just settlement in the middle east. She knows that our clear position is that we want an international conference as soon as possible. We strongly support the present efforts of the Egyptian Government in trying to bring Israeli and Palestinian representatives to see whether preliminary talks can start, so that there can be developments in that area. The tragic developments elsewhere in the middle east, in Lebanon, are a constant reminder of the urgent need to find a happier outcome and solution to the problems there.
My hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Mr. Forman) got into a discussion with the hon. Member for Newham, South (Mr. Spearing) about their different versions of sovereignty. One argued that national autonomy is unattainable and the other that the treaty of Rome is a denial of sovereignty. My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary made the Government's position on Europe clear. We see the Community as a framework for ever closer co-operation between the separate nation states. If, in the Community, we combine our separate strengths without any loss of national identity, that is the best way, and it is on that basis that the Community has evolved successfully so far. The Community could not succeed should it deny national customs and traditions. My right hon. Friend spoke clearly about our approach to Europe, and his remarks received warm support.
The right hon. Member for Tweddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale spoke in particular about Namibia. We have supported the United Nations peace plan throughout. We welcome the concilatory approach of the SWAPO leaders after their success in the election and we hope that SWAPO, with the other parties, will be able to reach 410 agreement on a new constitution. We fully support the efforts of the United Nations to ensure a peaceful transition to independence.
Although there will be a later debate on the subject, today's debate has been dominated by developments in eastern Europe and their implications for NATO and the European Community. We recognise that this is a time of great hope, but it is also a time of danger. One factor has struck me and it illustrates this point. Daily, we are re-learning the names of territories in eastern Europe that some of us did not remember. I had to get out the map to find out where Moldavia and Transylvania were. We already know where Armenia is. Not many years ago, these territories were cockpits of conflict and dissent. Now, they are once again in the news.
I have to choose a careful path between two right hon. Members. My right hon. Friend the Member for Pavilion rightly said—I do not wish to enlarge upon it, but I understand why he did so—that the Warsaw pact is bankrupt. A different situation is emerging as a result of the developments in certain eastern European countries. The right hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale warned that, when one sees what could happen between Hungary and Romania, Turkey and Bulgaria and Turkey and Greece, one realises that the existence of the Warsaw pact and NATO has acted as an over-control against what might otherwise be local disputes. Considering some of the names that I have just taken off the atlas, one sees the dangers of this dissolving into other local and rather vicious conflicts.
Recently, my right hon. Friend the Member for Pavilion and I were in Brussels, I was struck by the absence of the Italian Foreign Minister, who was attending in Budapest a conference with the Hungarian, Austrian and Yugoslav Foreign Ministers. That evoked the different relationships that might develop, and if developed constructively, could be to the benefit of stability.
As the Autumn Statement made clear, we stand secure in our present defences, willing to play our full part and anxious to see the success of the arms reduction talks in Vienna, the continuation of START and the successful development of the talks on chemical weapons between the United States and the Soviet Union. We affirm, more forcibly than ever before, our support for NATO and the vital need for NATO countries to stand together. It is inconceivable that successful arms negotiations and reductions can be achieved by 23 separate states. We need NATO and the Warsaw pact if negotiations on that difficult exercise are to be successfully completed. Standing firm in our defences does not mean that we seek to undermine the East, or to obstruct the encouraging developments that are taking place. That is manifestly not the case. The reality is that, while we stand firm and sure in our own defences, those developments will continue at a pace which almost defies description.
§ It being half-past Two o'clock, the debate stood adjourned.
§ Debate to be resumed on Monday 27 November.The UFC once again heads to Brazil on Jan. 14 for UFC 142 and the prelims will be showcased in a two-hour special on FX.

Lee County’s Board of Supervisors matter-of-factly met their constituents Monday morning in a hearing on the proposed redistricting lines for the five supervisory districts and the four constable and justice court judge districts, setting May 2 to meet and begin the process of adopting the proposed new lines.
Just 23 people attended the well-publicized hearing, including the board members, Chancery Clerk Bill Benson, and board attorney Gary Carnathan.
Consultant Chris Watson had maps of current and proposed new districts and charts showing the populations of the districts, the 2010 Census count, racial breakdowns of populations, and the demographics of proposed new districts.
Supervisors, who had previously seen the redrawn districts and the numbers, offered no comments and asked only one question, for clarification.
The hearing stood in stark contrast to the rancor seen in redrawing legislative districts, an issue thrown into the federal courts when the Legislature could not agree on the same plans for the House and the Senate.
The new, proposed districts drawn by the consulting firm Bridge & Watson, Inc. of Oxford, reflect changes in territory and population to bring total population, racial demographics, and physical characteristics into compliance with state and federal constitutional requirements.
In general, stronger growth in northern Lee County than in the southern part of the county drove the geographic realignment.
The district’s lone minority-majority district, District 4, would increase to 63.8 percent minority population from 61.7 percent, and a minority voting age population of 60.1 percent from 58.3 percent.
The minority population would drop by a small percentage in three other districts (2, 3 and 5), and increase slightly in District 1.
Census data, from which the new district lines were drawn, shows Lee County is 69.3 percent white, 27.3 percent black, and 3.4 percent other minorities.
District 4 Supervisor Tommie Lee Ivy, who is African-American, said he is pleased with the alignment.
The board’s acceptance of the plan, and required U.S. Department of Justice approval, would make Lee County’s compliance with the law a smooth and controversy-free transition, a reaffirming contrast to legislative arguments.
The proposed remap slices county voters in the city of Tupelo into oddly shaped arms of all five districts, but absent disqualifying issues raised in objections to the plan (none were voiced at the meeting except for one person who questioned the way District 5 would be reshaped beyond Tupelo’s city limits), it probbaly will be approved .Roasted Garlic and Shallot Potato Soup with Cheesy Croutons

Only I've got the nasty habbit of only being able to write a story with pen and paper, so it takes me an awful long time to update my stories. My ex-boyfriend showed me the Lotr movies and I fell in love with Legolas, and I got totally addicted to LOTR. So blame it on him that I'm writing about it now, hehe. ;)
Though lately I have been somewhat roped in by Real Life, which is really annoying if you just want to do fun things, I still am writing. But unfortunately none of those stories ever seem to be able to get finished...lol Oh wait that's not funny at all ;)
But now, after I found my old, half-finished stories as I was cleaning out my laptop, I'm back in bussiness again. So expect more stories to appear soon! I just happen to have some fickle muses, so it's always a big surprise even to me what story will be posted next ;)In a world full of luxurious long weaves, some people’s faux locks pass as the real thing. While a number of celebs opt for natural-looking weaves, others we simply assume have a head full of healthy hair.
From Teyana Taylor, to “Love & Hip-Hop’s” Chrissy Lampkin, here’s a list of celebs you might not know wear weave.
–danielle canadaIt’s been great to have my son involved in television. Of course, we have to watch the shows that he’s worked on: Survivorman, Canadian Pickers. More importantly, it’s opened up an interest in television channels that we might not otherwise watch. In this case, we’ve become fans of the Outdoor Life Network, History Channel, National Geographic Channel, and A&E TV.
Recently, another television show on A&E TV has really caught our attention. It’s called Storage Wars. It’s based on a relatively simple premise. You know those storage places you’ll find all over the place? Well, if you don’t pay your bills, you forfeit the contents of your storage. The reality show is all about what happens next.
Next…the contents are auctioned off. I haven’t been to an auction sale in years so it was really interesting when I first saw the show and now I’m hooked. There are basically four teams of players that go the auctions with the purpose of winning the contents of the locker via auction. The kicker is that the lock to the locker is cut open; they have five minutes to look inside to get a sense of what’s there; and then the auctioning begins. Upon completion, you get to go through the booty with the successful bidder to see what’s there. If they’re unsure of the value, they take it to experts for an opinion.
What’s neat about the show is that there’s an online version to test your ability to assign value to things that you might find!
You play the game and see just how good you are at spotting value.
It is an addictive game but, more importantly, it enhances the whole Storage Wars experience. There’s also a game that lets you play along with the television show.
I think that the combination of the game and the show is a winning combination. By themselves, the show and the game are pretty good. Put them together and you’ve got an experience that’s bigger than the sum of the parts.
They are interesting. I like how the two of them go hand in hand, complementing each other.
I then started to think about instructional design and gaming. It seems to me that so much use of technology use in the class is “made to fit” whether it fits or not. If I was a vendor of textbooks or a vendor of software, I’d take a look at the winning combination that you see here. Design of one should keep the other in mind. The net result may well be a learning environment that has more engagement than just one or the other.
And that’s a twenty dollar bill, all day long.hello, I was wondering if i could collect corn pollen to feed my bees for a spring buildup? latewood23@hotmail.com

Students at the University of South Carolina’s new medical school in Greenville, which is opening this month, will work on realistic human simulators that breathe, have heart beats and give birth. Computer programs and teachers rate the students’ performance on the artificial patients.
“This gives us an opportunity to train the next generation of doctors differently,” said Brenda Thames, vice president of academics at Greenville Hospital System, which has teamed with USC on the new medical school.
The school, which enrolls its first class of 53 students in less than two weeks, leases two of three floors of a new $60 million building on the hospital’s campus.
The other floor contains the simulation center, operated by the hospital. That center, which opened Friday, is part of a statewide network developed by Dr. John Schaefer, an endowed chair at the Medical University of South Carolina.
Other schools and emergency responders can use the simulators as well as USC’s Upstate medical school students, which will number 275 in four years.
Greenville has housed a simulation center for several years, but the new home includes more room and more state-of-the-art equipment.
The center features a delivery room, a nursery, a heart-patient room, an intensive-care unit and an operating room. Software programs can change scenarios in the patients – filled with high-tech machinery – such as suddenly having a patient start bleeding or develop an irregular heartbeat. Simulation center software programs developed by Schaefer’s team are being sold worldwide.
“It was patients I was learning on,” Schaefer said. “That’s going to change.”
The center was dedicated in the name Lewis Blackman, a 15-year-old Columbia resident who died in 2000 after mistakes by doctors at the Medical University of South Carolina.
“If this works as it should, this should give them the ability to have someone to call to recognize an emergency and respond in the way they should,” said Blackman’s mother, Helen Haskell, who wears a necklace with her son’s first and middle names that she made a year after his death. “I did not expect a lot of response from the medical community (after he died), but this is overwhelming. The whole focus on patient safety has been tremendously rewarding. But we still have a long way to go.”
USC’s medical school students have built ties with the Greenville Hospital System for years. Third- and fourth-year medical school students from the medical school’s Columbia campus have gone to Greenville since 1991 so they can work closely with its hospital system and network of doctors, said Dr. Jerry Youkey, dean of the USC School of Medicine Greenville.
The new four-year school itself is not using state money, though the simulation center, operated by the hospital, received $2.5 million from the General Assembly. The $186 million school is being paid for by the Greenville hospital, and student tuition and fees.
The Greenville school will have a different research concentration than the state’s two other medical programs in Columbia and Charleston. Those schools look at discovering new drugs, while the Greenville campus will examine clinical research and delivery – such as why a third of patients don’t take their medications, Youkey said.
The new medical school students also will work on a more global approach to care.
Students will start with six weeks of emergency-medical technician training. During the year, they will serve monthly shifts with Greenville responders, Youkey said. They also will follow a patient from the emergency scene through their hospital stay and even after they have gone home.
They will work with pharmacy and anesthetist nursing students taking classes on the hospital campus, too.
“This is a team sport,” Youkey said.Jahan Ara, Ph.D.

The street, located behind the Manlius Town Hall, is sandwiched between Limestone Creek and a feeder canal that brings water to the Erie Canal. It's the only neighborhood in the village without municipal water service or a fire hydrant.
On June 9, a suspicious fire destroyed an abandoned home at 125 Feeder St., which is 2,000 feet away from the nearest fire hydrant, near Garlock Street. "If a fire happened like that again, it would devastate both houses," said Charlie Welch, who owns two of the three homes left on the street.

As the stakeholders in the development of the Smart Grid converge on standards, we can expect to see the various sectors, such as utilities, transmission and distribution providers, and OEMs, establish positions to maximize their competitive advantage and opportunities for profit. There’s nothing wrong with that, of course, as long as the ultimate consumers of electric power are served well. That will happen if the consumers’ choice and control over consumption are preserved and enhanced. In this environment, the collaboration of ASHRAE and NEMA is good news for consumers. Standards for managing energy consumption across multiple product types and manufacturers will allow consumers to choose on the basis of cost, features, and performance, rather than compatibility with proprietary management systems. This initiative will establish a position for the needs of the consumer in parallel with the development of standards for the supply side.19 May – Florinda Ho Chiu Wan the heiress to the king of gambling, Stanley Ho, is supposedly on a long holiday with her new rumoured boyfriend, Hong Kong TVB actor Joel Chan Shan-Chung, according to reports by Jayne Stars website.
22 year-old Florida Ho, one of the 17 children of the popular casino tycoon, has been constantly updating photos of a mysterious seaside location and praised the beautiful scenery as the Hong Kong media rampantly speculates that Joel Chan is accompanying her.
Florinda's rumoured boyfriend, Joel Chan, 35, who made headlines when news of him ditching his wife for Florinda Ho came out last week, apparently took leave from TVB due to 'family reasons'.
His role in the TVB series "Return to the Three Kingdoms" was shortly reassigned to actor Pierre Ngo Ka-nin.
Joel's manager and TVB executive, Virginia Lok, confirmed that Joel was still on leave.
Virginia was reported as saying, "He took three weeks of leave, which is still in effect. As a result, no work has been assigned to him yet."
"We will wait for him to come back and understand the situation further prior to any work arrangements." She added.Posts Tagged: David's House of Brisket Results 1

THE “POWER 6″
Another division 1-A college athletic conference held it’s annual football media day yesterday. This was not one of the “Power 5″ conferences, but Conference USA served notice that it wouldn’t mind being the “Power 6th” with an impact announcement of it’s own, one that officially puts Conference USA ahead of the “Power 5″ in at least one area.
Earlier this week Big 12 commissioner Bob Bowlsby, at his league’s football media session, indicated that once the NCAA turns over the majority of it’s legislative power to the “Power 5″ next month, their first move will be to announce payments to scholarship athletes that cover all the costs of going to college as well as paying them an additional stipend. Yesterday Conference USA commissioner Britton Banowsky announced his league is already prepared to take that step, a move supported by the 14 presidents of the league, which includes such prominent all sports institutions as Alabama Birmingham, Marshall, Louisiana Tech, Southern Miss, Rice, Middle Tennessee, Old Dominion and Texas El Paso.
The “Power 5″, the Big Ten, Big 12, ACC, SEC and Pac 12, may be about to assume control of the NCAA, but no moss has grown on Conference USA, which is already ahead of most of those leagues in development toward the 16 team footprint determined by the “Power 5″ and now beats all of them to the all cost payment dynamic, at an expected additional cost per institution of $500 thousand a year.
Last summer the “Power 5″ announced that preference for 16 teams while opening the dialogue over full payments to athletes. This summer Conference USA beat them to the punch, seemingly a response to another suggestion from the “Power 5″ commissioners, that, in the future, they may determine there is room for a sixth league atop the NCAA power structure.
The American Athletic Conference holds it’s football media meetings next week and already it faces long odds of maintaining any position of prominence in the NCAA. If the “Power 5″ do determine there’s room to expand to a “Power 6″ Conference USA just took a giant step ahead of the AAC, increasing the urgency for transfer to a “Power 5″, or “Power 6″ league, for any program that wants to be a prominent part of the future of college athletics.

Metals
(Interscope; 2011)
By Brian Riewer | 25 October 2011
Feist once evoked all the distress of a sunflower on a spring day. Her music not only accepted heteronormative standards, but simplified them; courtship was as easy as “1 2 3 4 / Tell me that you love me more,” and “courtship” was still a word used. Probably. Monogamy just seemed so easy, apprehension best left for those preternaturally meant for domestic strife, those who rail against a happy hearth, those who would never stand up and sing, “I got a man to stick it out / And make a home from rented house / And we’ll collect the moments one by one / I guess that’s how the future’s done.”
At least that used to be the case. A sea change took place in Feist’s approach between the release of The Reminder (2007) and this, her fourth album; she’s gouged out most if not all of the saccharine good cheer that defined her work prior to Metals. Though the difference isn’t black and white, and though Feist was never a full-blown Stepford Wife or anything, here she undoubtedly questions the wisdom of traditionalist, Disney-inspired romantic fantasies, realizing that perhaps simply “stick[ing] it out” isn’t the way “the future’s done,” or at least isn’t necessarily the best—or only—way a life should be lived. Indeed, regarding that very “rented house” she mentioned in “Mushaboom,” with “Circle Marries the Line” she seems to be directly rejecting the placation she once described, discarding the notion “but in the meantime I got it hard / second floor living without a yard” in favor of describing something broader, something majestically alone: “I can form a path that leads up to a clearing / Get some distance while the woods come so near and / Then I’ll head out to horizon lines / Get some clarity oceanside.” Justifying the extreme change from domestication to wilderness, she explains, “[It] makes me remember the things that I forgot / It’s as much what it is as what it is not,” suggesting both that she lost who she was while entangled in a serious relationship, and that living in a forest, secluded, would be more desirable than going back.
Metals opens with teeth bared, “The Bad in Each Other” immediately being the biggest and meanest song Feist has ever penned as a solo artist. Like past openers “Gatekeeper” or “So Sorry”—the former only Feist and an acoustic guitar and the latter featuring the same with translucent accents—“The Bad in Each Other” sets the tone for the rest of the album. Thudding bass drums, mournful violins, and Colin Stetson’s saxophone lurk in the background. Leslie Feist sounds genuinely distressed for perhaps the first time in her career, her voice all rubbery and detached as she gives herself the role of metaphorical overused cup in the monogamous relationship, constantly being filled up and emptied out as per someone else’s whims. When she whips out the chorus—“When a good man and a good woman can’t find the good in each other / Then that good man and that good woman bring out the worst in the other”—Feist offers a bit of amnesty, but still maintains that simply being a good person in a relationship with another good person doesn’t amount to a viable future. Things get fucked up; maybe love is the one to blame?
This trepidation colors the way the rest of the album is broached, Feist uneasy with relationships in general, but with her forays specifically. “Caught a Long Wind” takes the prospect of fleeing from a relationship and relates it to the freedom a bird might enjoy, the breath of fresh air gasped at the break between two people the equivalent to the gust of wind allowing a sparrow flight. “Little bird have you got a key? / Unlock the lock inside of me,” she sighs, pushing herself towards the open with the help of devastating piano work and the morose clapping percussion that closes the song. This sentiment, of nature’s wheelings as the antithesis of romance, propels “A Commotion” as well, lovers’ clashes “block[ing] out the sun” and “turn[ing] heaven into hell”; a piano piece taken from Spoon’s haunting “The Ghost of You Still Lingers” gives the number its proper gravity. Some sarcasm directed at upper-middle class suburban life even peeks in; mingled with kazoo-ing guitar licks—much like what similarly jaded Annie Clark often uses—Feist describes the apocalyptic event sanitarily, calling it simply a “commotion.”
“Undiscovered First” is “A Commotion” but more, the shutters thrown open so the entire world can hear the turmoil within. “You can’t unthink a thought / Either it’s there or not,” she posits pensively, the kernel of this rebellion exploding, the song ending with grinding guitars and ground-shaking drum work, her shouting over the din, “Is this the right mountain for us to climb? / Is this the right river for us to ford? / Is this the way to live? / Is it wrong to want more?”
Feist is still the same glowing person behind this music video, so she does let the light in for a few of tracks, admitting not all is fire and brimstone at home, that her old, optimistic, somewhat traditional self is still inside her—in some fashion. Yet that light’s been tainted, the damage done to the trust she formerly had and the ease with which she transcended the inherent difficulties in relationships—in all her relationships. In fact, the most jaunty songs on Metals are “How Come You Never Go There” and “Graveyard”; the former contains the line, “We waste energy on protections / We’re living proof we’ve got to let go,” and the latter is about raising the dead from the grave. “Woe Be” is a pleasant piano ballad which tinkers about sweetly, but Feist deflatedly confesses within, “Woe be to the man who loves a songwriter / She’s always searching for a song in everything that you’ve done wrong.” You get the idea.
So despite being in a far more melancholy state compared to her outlook on past albums The Reminder and Let It Die (2004), Leslie Feist has managed to produce an even more intriguing character, one with depth and doubt and apprehension and dread and all the other things that make up the other, harder, larger half of the human experience. At least compared to the half sticking it out with a good man. It’s a welcome growth for an already well-rounded artist. And in 2011, Feist is ever rounder because of it.Sweden, Värmland Church Records (FamilySearch Historical Records)

hunters, rogues, and warlocks can use daggers, so it's only fair if Blizzard would make the daggers useable by anyone who is able to use daggers. otherwise, it's biased. i like rogues, but i do think this is the exact opposite image that a stealthy rogue would use, unless the rogue would be able to go invisible while wearing the wings.yes, i think that's the best option, let them either be able to be used by all classes that can use daggers, or make the rogue able to go invisible while wearing them so that we "normal unwinged" people can still enjoy looking up into the sky without getting mad at a rogue blocking out the sun.
After all this complaining, I am going to laugh when it comes out that the daggers have nothing to do with the wings. I am putting my money on those wings being the next big engineering tinker (which would shut up all the people crying about engineering being worthless in Cata).

The problem is caused by a piece of malware called the DNSchanger virus that was first discovered 5 years ago in 2007. The virus is estimated to have infected millions of computers worldwide with many still not disinfected of the virus.The DNSChanger virus altered settings in infected computers that means when your computer contacts its domain servers to find out the IP address of a website instead of being directed to legitimate DNS servers your computer is directed to rogue DNS servers setup by criminal organisations.
One sign of possibly been infected with this virus is that genuine sites are often redirected to sites that you did not want to visit. These sites could be copies of the legitimate sites that are designed to steal data or install even more malicious programs on your computer or they could just be redirecting you to advertising sites and limiting the use of your computer.
The criminals involved with this virus were arrested and imprisoned but the problem of what to do with the computer servers remained. The authorities knew that because of the high number of infections and the fact that many computers over the world now relied on these servers they could not just shut off the servers as that would be essentially turning off the internet for millions of people.
So they decided to turn these servers into genuine DNS servers but the problem is that running these machines costs the government a lot of money so they will be shutting off the servers on the 9th of July and for anyone infected by this virus the web simply will not exist after that.
Even if you are not infected by the DNS changer virus it is now becoming obvious that an anti-virus program is not enough to keep us safe. Running anti-malware software alongside our anti-virus programs such as Malwarebytes Anti-Malware
is becoming more and more necessary
So what can I do to check if im infected?
The simplest way to check for infection is via a website setup by the DCWG (DNSChanger Working Group) that allows you to check if your machine has been infected by the virus.
Visit to check if you DNS servers are infected.
You can also check via a command prompt by entering the following if for some reason you cannot use the website.
ipconfig /allcompartments /all
The virus used a number of DNS addresses. Compare your DNS server (highlighted red) to the below range to determine if you have been infected.
I’m infected with the DNSChanger virus how do I remove it
There are a number of tools that can remove the virus but 3 I have used personally on this malware infection can be found below. Follow the links to install and then run the programs. Once you have run the removers perform the check via the DCWG website again after restarting your computer.
Malwarebytes Pro – This is probably the most well known malware removal tool on the market.Not only will this remove malware infections it will also protect against future infections that can cause these kinds of problems. It is HIGHLY recommended you run an anti malware program alongside your anti-virus program nowadays to keep your computer clean. Malwarebytes Anti-Malware Lifetime
can currently be picked up for under $20!
Norton Power eraser –
Kaspersky TDSSKiller –
Once you have removed the virus it is Highly recommended you perform a full malware scan and virus scan. You can find help regarding anti-malware software at keeping your computer free of spyware and malware.
Further Information
You can read the warning regarding the virus directly on the FBI website at
It is highly recommended you check that you are not infected by this virus ASAP preferably before July the 9th or you too could be facing an internet blackout!Lost

Last week Ranger viewed a special on Public Television featuring two fine young American soldiers suffering Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) resulting from IED attacks suffered while serving in Afghanistan. The piece focused on the collateral damage to the families of these once-vibrant young men.
The documentary opened with a voice-over regarding one soldier who had become paralyzed after his IED attack. The viewer is then told that following extensive rehabilitation, the soldier is now capable of movement, giving a feeling of hope. The camera now flashes to that young man in a wheelchair, being spoken to, vacantly staring ahead, trying to make meaning from the words being spoken to him by his father. He is not o.k.
The ramifications were heartbreaking, but that is a quality that can't be quantified; however, the financial cost can be evaluated. Private facilities charge $80,000/month to attempt to rehabilitate these men.
The cost to the Department of Veterans Affairs is $40,000 per month. Neither figures calculate the additional cost of benefits being paid to these men, who deserve nothing but the best.
The U.S. citizenry must ask: What in Afghanistan was worth the cost that is being borne by these injured young people, who number in the thousands? As a society, we fail to consider the future costs of caring for these injured shells of once proud soldiers.
Both men had Ranger and Marine flags and wore Ranger and USMC hats, which strikes Ranger in a contradictory manner. Here we are, viewing the the sad result that service ultimately entails, and this is the juxtaposed against showy pride in that sacrifice. This is fine and good, but Ranger wonders how many Rangers or Marines will ever visit these men once they return home from our far-flung, endless wars.
One would expect not often, since warriors are not known for their empathy.
We as a society are lost when we willingly accept -- and in fact, cheer on -- the slaughter and diminution of our young in wars that are questionable at best; criminal at worst. Which is worse: Having seen this on t.v., or having seen it in the wards of the 24th Evac Hospital in Long Binh, RVN?
It was just business as usual back then for a young Ranger. But to an old Ranger, the sorrow is devastating.

Shopping online requires same security as walking through a parking lot
December 9, 2010
By David Agan, Public Affairs Office
FORT RUCKER, Ala. -- Shopping online can be an attractive alternative to the crowded malls, long checkout lines and unruly mobs of shoppers that have become regular fixtures of the modern holiday season.
Along with the convenience of buying presents from the warmth of a shopper's home, however, comes the threat of online scams and identity theft that could sour the holiday cheer. However, there are some easy ways people can protect themselves, their money and identities while shopping online.
"Safe online shopping starts with your computer," said Thomas Brindisi, Network Security Administrator with the Fort Rucker Network Enterprise Center. "Always keep it updated with the most recent patches." Typically, computers automatically download and install the latest security patches and updates, but people should manually check before they begin making purchases online.
"There is never a better time to have antivirus, anti-malware and anti-spyware software installed on your computer than when you are about to enter personal information on the Internet," said Wes Hamilton, Service Desk Supervisor for Fort Rucker. "Current DoD employees are authorized to download antivirus products from the (U.S. Army Computer Emergency Response Team)."
The ACERT website can be accessed at.
Always make sure your Internet browser is up to date, Hamilton said. You can normally find the 'Check for Updates' option in your browser's 'Tools' or 'Help' menu items, so check regularly to ensure you have installed the latest updates and security patches.
Some browsers feature downloadable filters or plug-ins that will warn people if they attempt to visit a known phishing site. For more information, enter 'phishing filter' or 'smartscreen filter' into a search engine.
With the computer and browser fully updated, it's time to start shopping.
When it comes to buying online, shoppers should always be conscious of whom they are doing business with. Make sure you are buying from the right site, Hamilton said. Looks can be deceiving - just because it looks like the website you think you're on doesn't mean that it is.
Avoid clicking links sent to email addressed because they might be links to malicious phishing sites intent on stealing credit card information. People should manually enter the address into browsers if they know for what site they are looking.
Once the shopping cart is filled and it's time to checkout, take a look at the browser's address bar and look for a few signs that indicate the payment information is secure. Never give any personal or payment information to a Web site unless the address starts with HTTPS. Most Web site addresses (or URLs) begin with HTTP, but the 'S' in HTTPS is critical when it comes to online shopping. The 'S' indicates that the connection between the computer and the website the shopper is buying from is encrypted and secure.
The browser will also display a padlock or similar icon as a clear sign the shopper is visiting a legitimate, secured website.
Shop on a home network and never on a public network. You never know who is listening to wireless network traffic at the local coffeehouse, so avoid entering personal information when connected to a public network, Brindisi said.
When it comes to payment methods, credit cards typically offer the most consumer protection. Always use a credit card over a debit card. Credit card transactions are protected by the Fair Credit Billing Act. This allows shoppers, under certain circumstances, to dispute charges and temporarily withhold payment while the creditor investigates. It also limits liability in the event of unauthorized charges.
Some credit card companies offer one time numbers. These are credit card numbers that are good for one use only. Check the credit card company's Web site or call the customer support line for details.
Be suspicious. People who have encountered a malicious Web site, have been a victim of online fraud or identity theft, should contact the state's Attorney General, the Better Business Bureau or visit for more information.Star Tracks

Try Las Tres Virgenes. very good food. try either the poblano chili soup or the tortilla. both very good also their lam shank was was too much for 2 people so if you have a group it's really good. SHARE!! portions are very large. the blue crab enchiladas were fantastic and so was the lobster. simply but nicely furnished the atmosphere copliments the food. a must.
another good option, not quite as fancy, Supper Burro Tacqueria makes good food. we had 2 carne asadas and 4 tacos. all very good. only drink coca-cola but thats ok because just down the street there is a mini-super (they let you bring beer.) Not so much a taco stand as a very Mexican kitchen with an open air seating area attached. best part- La Cuenta. $15.
although Super Burro is good deffenatly go to Tres Virgenes at some point in your trip
good eating!An Online Privacy Adventure
Renee Montagne explores the various bits of private information available online with Nora Paul, director of the Institute for New Media Studies at the University of Minnesota. They use Steve Inskeep as a test case.
STEVE INSKEEP, host:
All this week on MORNING EDITION, we're talking about privacy. And this morning, we have something of an experiment. Renee, I've been spying on you, and discovered you've been spying on me.
RENEE MONTAGNE, host:
Wait, how did you find that out?
INSKEEP: Oh, well, you asked me in advance. But any way, please, go ahead.
MONTAGNE: Well, yes. Indeed, we asked Nora Paul to help with some digging that I thought might be interesting to do. She's director of the Institute for New Media Studies at the University of Minnesota. And she joined us from the studios of Minnesota Public Radio.
Ms. NORA PAUL (Director, Institute for New Media Studies, University of Minnesota): Good morning.
MONTAGNE: So, you've got a computer with you there. Where do we begin this adventure into Steve's online privacy?
Ms. PAUL: First of all, my first stop is Google. And so, I Googled Steve Inskeep, and really, didn't find very much. Which...
MONTAGNE: I think that might upset him.
Ms. PAUL: Well, turns out I had spelled his name with two N's instead of one. So, once I went back in and spelled Inskeep correctly, there was a great thing that told me where he was raised in Carmel, Indiana, and that he was a graduate of Morehead State University. And that he lives in the District of Columbia.
MONTAGNE: What's the next thing you would go to, to dig a little deeper into Steve's life?
Ms. PAUL: Well, having gotten that clue that he lived in D.C., I was able to go into U.S. Search. And they said that there was a Steven Alan Inskeep, and that he's 37 years old. And there were several addresses found for him: three in District of Columbia, one in Hoboken, New Jersey, one in Astoria, New York, and one in Long Island City. With this information, if you want to take it further and get the advanced background search, which would give you things like property value, bankruptcies, you have to pay $39.95. And then, if you want it within an hour, then you pay another $20.
MONTAGNE: You just mentioned an address, and that seems to be a key thing. Is there gateway information? That is, a couple of things, that if one could get a hold of, it opens a door into a lot of information?
Ms. PAUL: Well, certainly, if you have social security number, you're golden. You could be sure that this is the person that you are talking about, because otherwise, without some other specific identifying information, you can't be entirely sure that you're following the path of the right person.
MONTAGNE: Now, so far, in this little minimal search of yours, we haven't discovered anything too juicy about Steve.
Ms. PAUL: No. It depends on why you're trying to go find information. If your daughter is getting ready to go start dating somebody, you might want to check his name real quick in the, you know, the criminal records. Or, in the case of that gentleman who invited somebody into his house...
MONTAGNE: This is our story yesterday, a roommate who took over his life, if you will.
Ms. PAUL: Yeah.
MONTAGNE: And certain information.
Ms. PAUL: So, if you're really, what you're trying to find out is somebody isn't something, there are really useful ways to do that.
MONTAGNE: So far, it would suggest that Steve, our Steve Inskeep, lives a quiet life.
Ms. PAUL: Mm-hmm.
MONTAGNE: I mean, if you had wanted to know if he'd served, you know, a long prison term, would we have come across it, in so far in what you're looking at?
Ms. PAUL: If you decide that's what you want to know, then there are paths to go check criminal records. In fact, this advanced background search that I did for Steve, for another $15, it would do a nationwide criminal search.
MONTAGNE: Probably not worth it, though, right?
Ms. PAUL: No. Yeah. I don't, I hope not. I imagine your human relations people did a little background, and, yeah.
MONTAGNE: So do we. Well, for the average person, someone who may not have found his way into the newspapers for any particular reason, that sort of thing, is there anything private?
Ms. PAUL: Well, this is what's intriguing to me about the whole notion of privacy. There's the records gathered about you because of your life as a citizen. There are increasingly, records gathered about you in your life as a consumer; and those are records that you volunteer, you know, every time that you order something on Amazon, and things like that. And then, there's information about people that's very personal, that's being contributed by themselves in blogs, in news group discussions, and things like that. And that may well be where there will be more long-term invasion of privacy, because it's really getting at people's thoughts, opinions, and things like that.
MONTAGNE: Which, say young people, teenagers maybe, might put on with nary a thought for 20 years down the road.
Ms. PAUL: Exactly. Exactly.
MONTAGNE: Now, given what we've found about Steve, think he should be alarmed?
Ms. PAUL: If he was trying to stay entirely private about where he lives, perhaps. But there's a whole lot of offline ways to have your privacy invaded, if that's what somebody is intent on doing.
MONTAGNE: Nora Paul, thanks very much for talking with us.
Ms. PAUL: Sure.
MONTAGNE: Nora Paul is director of the Institute for New Media Studies at the University of Minnesota.
And Steve, I hesitate to ask, but let me ask. What you think about all this?
INSKEEP: Well, I'm relieved to find that at least the internet doesn't yet do pronunciation very well, because it's Carmel, Indiana not Carmel. Carmel is the name. But other than that, everything seems fine.
MONTAGNE: Well, we continue these discussions. Tomorrow, a company actually doing this kind of research about us with our.By Gary M. Kramer | /Bent June 23, 2014 at 2:21PM
This year’s Frameline Film Festival offers more than a half dozen features from Latin America that sensitively depict queer lives and love. Two Brazilian features—a terrific debut by Daniel Ribeiro, and the latest drama by Karim Aïnouz—are highlights at this year’s fest. And two more —from Mexico, and Venezuela— showcase gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender characters in various stages of desire.
Here's a look at all four of them. They all still have screenings at the festival, with more information as to how to get tickets here.
The Way He Looks
The sweet and sunny romance, The Way He Looks, is Daniel Ribeiro’s feature length version of his excellent 2010 short Eu Não Quero Voltar Sozinho. Leonardo (Ghilherme Lobo) is a blind teenager whose best friend Giovana (Tess Amorim) assists him. When Gabriel (Fabio Audi) joins the class, he befriends Leo and Gi. However, a class assignment forces Gabriel and Leo to work together, and the guys soon form an intimate bond. They go to the movies together (Gabriel describes the action to Leo); they sneak out late at night to watch an eclipse; and Gabriel teaches the classical-loving Leo about modern music. Ribeiro infuses these moments—Leo hugging Gabriel on the bicycle they share, or Gabriel guiding Leo to dance—with a tender sexual tension to show how these two teenagers might fall in love. The film’s visual cues are strong. A scene of Leo practicing kissing in the shower expresses the desires he feels but does not express. This is what makes The Way He Looks so magical; the guys never discuss their emotions, but they are all tactile. When Gabriel plants a kiss on Leo, or the two friends shower together—and Gabriel becomes aroused—the unspoken attraction hangs in the air. Ribeiro’s approach to telling Leo’s story prompts viewers to want the boys to couple up. Of course, there are subplots that try to keep the guys apart. Giovana becomes jealous, Leo’s classmates mock him, and Leo has battles with his overprotective mother. But The Way He Looks ends on a satisfying (if not unexpected) note. This enjoyable film will leave a smile in one’s heart.
Futuro Beach
Also from Brazil is Karim Aïnouz’s Futuro Beach, a gripping three-part drama that begins in dangerous waters of the title location. Donato (Wagner Moura) is a lifeguard unable to save a drowning man. He offers support to the deceased’s friend Konrad (Clements Schick), and the two men are soon having a hot and heavy tryst. Their intense affair does not end after Konrad returns to Germany. There is something that remains between these men—like the aggressive salt in Futuro beach that corrodes refrigerators. Part two of the film has Donato visiting Konrad in Germany. The men fuck and fight and discuss the future of their relationship. Aïnouz makes this minimal drama hypnotic as the men each express palpable despair while alone in their non-native lands, and even, at times, when they are together.
Futuro Beach shifts gears a bit with the third story, which features Ayrton (Jesuita Barboso), Donato’s younger brother, but it forms a symmetry with the first two parts.
Aïnouz deliberately employs an elliptical narrative to let viewers make connections and fill in the gaps, and this strategy is what makes the film so compelling and affecting. Moreover, the filmmaker’s compositions—the characters are framed on beaches, in showers, and in pools—reveals much about their emotional state, even if it is a bit obvious to have water splashing on jagged rocks to emphasize that status of Donato and Konrad’s relationship. The way the men interact is also freighted with meaning, especially when Donato and Konrad dance together. Aïnouz also lovingly films the men’s beefy, bronzed bodies, nearly and completely naked. Futuro Beach, may be his most erotic film since Madame Sata. It is also one of his strongest.
Everybody's Got Somebody… But Me
Everybody’s Got Somebody…But Me, is a luminously shot, poetically made drama from Mexico, about a lesbian couple in the throws of a heated relationship. Alejandra (Andrea Portal) is a publishing executive who begins a romance with María (Naian Daeva), a high school student. The film never makes their age difference creepy, but María is restless and immature. She wants to talk while the couple is at the movies, or itches to dance while at a café where a band plays. Some of this impulsiveness is adorable, but the teenager’s penchant to take phone calls or connect with friends at parties is often irritating to Alejandra. Writer/director Raúl Fuentes artfully films their rollercoaster relationship, and he breaks up the fights, flirtations, and reconnections along with other standard-issue couples “drama” using poetic inter-titles. He also shrewdly positions his characters within the narrative and each scene, in marked contrast to each other to comment on their relationship status. Flores is trying—as Alejandra explains to María in one scene—to “find the extraordinary in the ordinary.” Whether he succeeds or not depends on the viewer; some of the dynamics between the lovers will resonate with knowing audiences, while others may be bored to the back teeth by the lack emotional depth. Regardless of one’s investment in the love story, Everybody’s Got Somebody…But Me is undeniably incandescent.
My Straight Son
My Straight Son, from Venezuela, is a sleek and superficial comic melodrama. Diego (Guillermo García) and his obstetrician boyfriend, Fabrizio (Sócrates Serrano) discuss plans to live together, although Diego resists commitment. When Valentina (Arlette Torres), the mother of Diego’s 15 year-old son, Armando (Ignacio Montes), calls asking him to take care of their kid, he reluctantly agrees. Just as Diego is adjusting to this situation, however, Fabrizio lies comatose after being beaten by a group of homophobic thugs. My Straight Son shows how Diego adjusts to these changes in his life and how he bonds with his estranged son. The film provides lessons of tolerance, from learning how to love one’s self and one’s family, to appreciating diversity. The messages have their heart in the right place, but this overlong and underwhelming film shoehorns too many characters and subplots for comfort. In his feature debut, writer/director Miguel Ferrari, includes wacky humor in the form of Delirio del Rio (Hilda Abrahamz), a transgender performer, and mines other laughs from Perla Marina (Carolina Torres), Diego’s assistant who is enduring domestic abuse (ha ha!) from her boyfriend. Other subplots include Armando chatting with--and lying to--a potential girlfriend online, along with Diego’s efforts to bring Fabrizio’s assailants to justice. Ferrari shift tones so often in My Straight Son, viewers may suffer whiplash. The film is certainly made to be a crowd-pleaser—how else to account for Delirio’s dexterity with a gun, tango, and no-nonsense advise?—and it has entertaining moments, but overall My Straight Son is far less than the sum of its parts.Products.

Seeing the paparazzi camped outside the various forts of Jodhpur (usally the wrong one) desperately trying and failing to get a snap of events going on behind the high walls, reminds me of a story told by Gaj Singh, the current Maharaja of Jodhpur.
Gaj Singh's grandmother was pursued by tabloids
The year was 1925 and Gaj Singh's grandmother, whose name I forget, was on a visit to London, staying at the Savoy Hotel, the favourite boarding house of Indian maharajas over the years.
In those days strict purdah was still observed, shielding the royal family's women from the gaze of strangers.
And so it was that each morning, the Maharaja's grandmother was transported the short distance from her hotel room to her Rolls Royce in a heavily curtained palanquin which is still on display today at the Meherangarh [literally, Majestic Fort], the family seat for than 500 years.
Such modesty was, of course, a red-rag to the red tops of the day who vied to snatch a photograph of the hidden queen using all the tricks familiar to the modern paparazzi.
After weeks of stakeout and tabloid skulduggery, however, they managed only a picture of the royal ankle, which to the fury of the family, was then splashed over the front pages.
The story ends with the Maharaja of day in a blind rage, ordering out all his staff onto the streets of London to buy every single copy of the offending editions to save his wife's blushes.
Eighty years on and things haven't changed much, with Liz and Arun flitting from fort to fort in their Bentley, shielding young Damian in an attempt to hide him from the merciless attentions of theWhat Is Aetna Dmo Dental Plan Reviews

- re: monkeyboy7
I guess our fondue tonight at the Don Mills location was the miss, because it was just plain bad. The so called Brie & Lobster had a few flecks of actual lobster in it, and the cheese tasted like bland cheddar.
The mushroom soup was barely warm, and loaded with sediment from unproperly washed mushrooms. My wife's Ahi Tuna was flavourless. The only decent dish was my Kobe beef burger, done perfectly to med rare. Too bad the frites were limp and soggy.
I was hoping the 6 small glass sampler tray had more unique beers that you can't get at local stores, but most of them I had already tried from the LCBO just down the block.
Their Grimbergen was a thing of beauty (first time trying it). Can't remember if it was the Optimo Bruno or Dubbel?

Hoping?
For those of you who crave U.S. style BBQ, I can recommend the Bashamichi Taproom, which opened this past Saturday in Yokohama. It is the only restaurant I know of in the Tokyo/Yokohama area that offers authentic BBQ that is traditionally smoked over wood for several hours using low heat. I was there on Sunday and found all the BBQ meats plus the side dishes to be delicious....
- re: ruprecht25
Love US style pit BBQ. I heard about that place and glad it opened up close to my work.
I've been following their blog, so expecting some good BBQ.
Hato's bar in Nakameguro was the first place I had true BBQ here in Japan.
The guys that run the place are cool and I've got to give them credit for pulling it off.
Their pulled pork (smoked with cherry wood) is impressive. Their ribs are great as well.
They also have biscuits and gravy which was a nice surprise.
Looking forward to trying bairdbeer/taproom's new BBQ place though.
To me it's a long time coming for decent BBQ in Japan. Bubby's (the Yokohama branch of the TriBeCa/NYC Restaurant) is now serving "pit BBQ" according to an advertisement poster my friend saw, so I think this is the start of the US BBQ trend in Japan. Though I'm hoping it isn't just a trend.
- re: sonik212
- re: davey.c
I also tried Hato's bar last week for the first time. As mentioned by sonik and davey.c, the atmosphere is excellent and the staff and guests are really friendly. The beers change regularly - one of the IPAs I tried was great and the other beers were at least okay. I ordered the pork spareribs and the pulled pork sandwich. The sandwich was tasty. The ribs had nice flavor, but they weren't very meaty. I also give it a thumbs up and will definitely return to get my pork and craft beer fix.
- re: ruprecht25
Tried the Bashamichi Taproom BBQ in Yokohama last night.
They have some decent BBQ and craft beers to wash it down.
I tried the beef brisket sandwich and a slab of the "Fat" Japanese BBQ rib, both were great!
However I found the pork sandwich to be a disappointment.
They have 3 different BBQ sauces; mustard based, vinegar based and just plain BBQ.
For pork I prefer Hato's Bar (Nakameguro) pork sandwich, which has never disappointed but glad to see places in Japan finally catching up with true US style BBQ. With the Bashamichi Taproom on one end and Hato's bar in Nakameguro on the other, the Tokyu Toyoko line should be dubbed the BBQ express. Still haven't tried Bubby's BBQ sandwich in the Sakuragicho/Minato Mirai area, but not in any rush.

- re: Robb S
yeah...lol. It's been too long without NY pizza. I used to have it a couple times a week before coming out here and was pretty much raised on the stuff. I want people to know about it because I want them to stay around a while! Also I know a lot of foreigners say the same thing about pizza so want to make sure people know about the place. But, yeah... good slices that I can actually call NY style.
- re: sonik212
- re: gkanai
Gkanai-
I used to hit up MIKE DUE on 3rd and 25th?... I'd say Rocco's is as good as most decent pizza joints in NYC. At least in my humble opinion.
Yeah Oji is a trek for me too, but I think I need to make a trek this weekend. I'll have to hit it on a trip to Ueno or something. It's like 10-15 minutes from that area.
Lauderdale in Roppongi () is good, though I'd be lying if I said it actually reminded me of home. I have American friends who insist that Pizzakaya () is good for US-style pies, though I'd much rather go and get the Italian version elsewhere.
If anybody knows where to get a good cheese pasty like they make them in Blighty, I'd be very interested to hear about it.
Those looking for a decent burrito (like Chipotle) should check out Frijoles in Azabu Juban. The closest I've come across to "American-ized" Burritos. Good burritos. The size is a little small but that's Japan for you. Google them and you'll find them. English OK, in fact I think most of the customers that I'e seen there are foreigners.

I wonder if it's the perception of beans in tex-mex dishes as filling, stodgy foods that make lunch diners feel too bloated to work effectively afterwards and evening diners worried that they might become overcome with the urge to pass wind in the presence of their dinner dates. And I meant the word 'perception' here, I mean no disrespect whatsoever to real Mexican food (not the tex-mex kind so much) which I rate highly.
I'm afraid I've not visited any Mexican places in Tokyo, my father-in-law loves and appreciates Spanish cuisine and I've been with him to a range of Spanish and Portuguese restaurants, pretty much all of them had savoury bean dishes on the menu.
How about a feijoada (フェジョアーダ )
somewhere like Tucano's?...
There seems to be a few other places in Tokyo that sell beans cooked in this way.

Frijoles is good, but somehow doesn't make it to great. I'm not sure what they're missing. The ingredients are fresh, and I've tried almost all of the combinations, and they definitely satisfy the urge for quality Mexican fast food, and I go back regularly, but they're missing something- not sure what it is. Maybe a sauce or maybe a melted cheese something or...

Never heard of the place but just punched it up on google. I like their menu. Buttermilk Fried Chicken with Sweet Potato Fries.... nice. A lot on their menu sounds really good. Need to check them out at some point soon. Especially since they have a BYOB night on the first Friday of every month.

For Susan Chin, it was a shocker.
She's around 80-years-old and is about to sell her house and move into a senior citizens complex and she wanted her final water bill.
Over the past six months, the bills have been consistently averaged in the $21 to $25 range. But when she got her final statement -- it blew her away. The bill was $832.66.
Chin didn't understand it.
She says DeKalb Water insisted the meter and the readings were accurate. But she and her neighbors spent hours checking the readings and what little water was being used the house and they could not figure it out.
Ms Chin contacted the DeKalb Water Department but says she hit a dead end.
So the 11Alive Help Desk stepped in and gave her a hand.`
We contacted DeKalb County and wanted an immediate adjustment to the bill.
The DeKalb Water Department admitted that the meter was broken and the Chin's bills were based on meter readings that were inaccurate and dating back more than a year. So, we asked for a realistic adjustment.
And now, Chin owes DeKalb Water only $23.49.
She closes on her home next week.All hotels in Irving, Texas, United States of America

Upon hearing the premise for the new horror film "We Are What We Are," many people will no doubt assume that it will be some kind of grisly dark comedy combining jet-black humor with gruesome imagery designed to keep viewers from making any visits to the concession stand in the immediate future. Instead, it treats the concept in a quiet and deliberate manner throughout and while such an approach may prove disappointing to anyone hoping for a broadly drawn bloodbath, the serious and respectful tone helps to make for a genuinely creepy moviegoing experience that will attract both serious fans of the genre and those viewers simply looking for a well-told story. (A story, it should be noted, that is probably best experienced knowing as little about the details, such as the ones I am about to reveal, as possible.)
Set in a remote small town outside of the Catskill Mountains, the film centers on the Parkers, a fairly reclusive but otherwise normal-seeming family that, as the story opens, is marked by tragedy when the matriarch dies in a tragic accident brought on by a massive rainstorm. This is horrible enough but to make things worse, it is just about time for them to go through a religious ritual that has been performed in the family for a couple of centuries and which can only be done by the woman of the house. Oh yeah, the ritual in question involves cannibalism.
Reeling from his wife's death, domineering father Frank (Bill Sage) insists on pressing ahead and goes out the night of his wife's death to bring back a not-so-willing volunteer to manacle in the basement in preparation for the ceremony. On the other hand, teenage daughters Iris (Ambyr Childers) and Rose (Julia Garner) are not quite as enthused with the responsibilities that have suddenly been forced upon them. What the Parkers don't realize is that their ghastly secrets are in danger of being revealed by the police, a curious neighbor (Kelly McGillis) and a local doctor (Michael Parks) whose daughter was a Parker house entree. Even Mother Nature gets into the act, as the torrential rains begin to uncover skeletal evidence of unspeakable crimes.
If this plot sounds slightly familiar to you, it may be because "We Are What We Are" is a remake of a 2010 Mexican film that received a bit of acclaim among horror film fans. I never got a chance to see that film but from what I understand, co-writers Jim Mickle and Nick Damici (the former also directed) have taken the basic premise and then played around with it in a number of ways. The key change, so I hear, is that the genders of the key characters have been switched around—in the original, it was the father who died, the mother who encouraged her brood to carry on and a son who found himself forced to carry on the unspeakable tradition. I also hear that in that version, the keeping of the tradition was driven by socio-economic factors instead of misplaced religious fervor.
Although I am curious to see that version now, I must say that this remake is a more than satisfying moviegoing experience in its own right. Most filmmakers might have taken this basic premise in order to play it as grisly black comedy along the lines of "Motel Hell" ("It takes all sorts of critters to make Farmer Vincent's fritters") and it could well have worked that way. However, by taking the decidedly lurid material seriously, Mickle and Damici have attempted something far more challenging and the risk pays off. From a tonal standpoint, the whole thing is a high-wire act in the sense that if there is one dramatic misstep or bad laugh, the whole thing could collapse in an instant.
Aside from a couple of moments where things could have been tightened slightly, the film never stumbles and the result is one of the more remarkable horror films of late—one that does not rely on sudden shocks or outrageous gore to get under the skin of its viewers. This is not to say that the film can't pull off such moments—there is one scene in which a moment of rare tenderness is brutally interrupted in a genuinely shocking manner and the similarly out-of-nowhere Grand Guignol finale will raise eyebrows and gorges in equal measure. However, it creates an atmosphere of dampness and dread that is genuinely convincing and is far more unnerving in the end that any amount of fake blood.
Intelligently conceived, beautifully executed and filled with surprisingly convincing performances all around (Sage creates an aura of quiet menace that is impossible to shake and Childers and Garner are both heartbreaking as the daughters), "We Are What We Are" is that rare horror film that could play at both arthouse and grindhouse theaters without seemingly out of place at either one. Genre fans will eat it up—no pun intended—but it might prove to be a harder sell for viewers who aren't necessarily jazzed with the idea of watching murder and cannibalism that isn't set to the music of Stephen Sondheim. To those people, I assure you that in terms of smart and serious filmmaking, I would put this film up against any "serious" movie that has come out so far this year and I implore you to give it a chance. Just don't make any plans for dinner.The luxurious Jaguar XJ sports sedan will have you finding excuses to drive places.

Hi,
Thanks for reading my question. I am not very experienced here so I would be grateful for any insight.
I want to attach a probe to a solid support and use it to bind a mRNA. In the microarray the probe is just attached to the support but other techniques use a biotinylated probe bound to bound streptavidin to capture the target. What is the difference between the binding efficiency of a strepatividn bound probe and a probe that is stuck on the support by other means?
Thanks, FreddieP
The affinity and specificity between streptavidin and biotin is extremely high (you should be able to look up binding constants and the like). However, this will pick up ANY biotinylated molecule but tells you nothing about which molecules you have. Conversely the idea behind microarray is that each specific sequence attached to the chip has a different and specific target, so that you can identify which attached sequences have bound a target mRNA, and can from that deduce patterns of gene expression.
I am referring to the situation when the specific probe is labelled with biotin and bound to streptavidin, which is bound to the support. Instead of the specific probe directly to the support, the probe is bound to streptavidin. Why do people use streptavidin to bind the probe when they could just attach the probe to the support?
There will be three reasons 1) - it is relatively easy (chemically speaking) to attach streptavidin to surfaces, 2) - streptavidin is abundant and easy to prepare, 3) - it is easy to biotinylate probes and therefore easy to customize what is added where.
Hi Freddie,
There are a few reasons to do this. The first is that you can sometimes get better kinetics with a biotin-oligo bound to an avidin surface. Using direct covalent coupling usually requires some sort of aliphatic linker (C6 or C12 liner) to help get the oligo up off of the surface in order to improve hybridisation. Using biotin-avidin can accomplish a similar effect.
Also - some of the covalent chemistries like those which use aldehyde surfaces - the reaction that occurs to create the imine bond (Schiff Base) is actually reversible. The imine needs to be reduced by something like sodium borohydride to create a more stable bond. This reduction reaction can potentially cause problems if for example you want to use a fluorphore labelled oligo. The strepatvidin-biotin of course occurs rapidly and is very tight and essentially non-reversable.
That all being said - the vast majority of DNA arrays use either eletrostatic type interactions or use covalent linkages (aldehyde or epoxy surface). Many people reported the biotin approach but it never really took off because in practice is tended to perform poorly (higher background, lower dynamic range etc...).
Is streptavidin easy to prepare? I hear that it is not easy to prepare although I have never done it. Also, I am interested in expense. You can't buy strepatividin cheaply anywhere. A few companies are coming out with large batches of streptavidin but mostly you only can buy small batches, very costly. The expense of purifying it yourself is unknown to me. Direct binding seems less costly but the efficiency of binding the target is also important.directory comparison for node.js using hive-loader
A directory comparison system using hive-loader/node.js. Compares two or more directories.
The comparisons have three possible "depths":
Note that tests that fail a simpler test will not be subjected to higher tests; that is, if a file is not found in all the directories you pass in, the instances of it that do exist will not be compared by size/content.
To compare two or more directories, simply call
var dd = new ndd.Dir_Diff( [ path.resolve(root, 'test_1'), path.resolve(root, 'test_2'), path.resolve(root, 'test_3') ], 'full' ); dd.compare(function (err, result) { if (result.deviation > 0){ console.log('you have %s deviations!', result.deviation); console.log(util.inspect(deviation)); }
});
Any number of directories can be passed in; if the comparison mode is omitted, 'list' is assumed.
The first item in the list is taken as the "normal" directory; this won't affect deviations, but it does explain what the basis is for report elements like "added" or "missing".
The feedback to the callback is a report object:
{
root_dirs: [the input to dir_diff],
added: [info]
dirs: {dir_hash}
file_status: [file-dir-status],
dir_status: [file-dir-status],
deviation: posint,
deviations: [deviation-report],
common_files: common_files,
added: added,
missing: missing
};
Most of the report is work product; the deviation and deviations properties are the most significant elements of the report.
where info is
{
subpath: string (relative to root dir),
path: string (absolute pate to file),
type: string ('file' or 'dir'),
root: string (the root dir)

These days, frugality has really become a lifestyle. To be frugal means to make subtle lifestyle changes that over time help you to live a more financially-free life. That's a big deal, and being part of those changes in others makes me feel good, which is a big part of why I enjoy writing about frugal tips so much. So, today I'm going to tell you about a few subtle lifestyle changes you can make that will help you become even more frugal.
Change your coffee habits.
When I moved from West Palm Beach to Portland, one of the first things I noticed was that there were tons of coffee shops in Portland. I couldn't imagine that all of them could be profitable. Boy, was I wrong! Everyone here seems to grab a $4 cup of coffee every day on the way to work. Tons of people do it a few times a day. If you think about it, that really adds up!
The most expensive coffee in my local grocery store is a can that makes about 40 cups and costs 14 bucks. That breaks down to 35 cents per cup of coffee. So, stop going to expensive coffee shops! Invest a few bucks in a coffee machine and make your coffee at home. If you buy $4 cups of coffee three days a week, changing your habits and making your coffee at home will save you about $570 a year.
Plan to shop on your busiest days.
Grocery stores are evil! All retail stores are evil. When you walk in, they want to suck every dime they can out of your pocket. They spend tens of thousands of dollars hiring consultants that tell them where to put impulse buy types of products on their shelves. They go to great lengths to make sure that the longer you're in their store, the more money you spend. Don't become a victim of subliminal marketing!
From now on, plan to go grocery shopping on your busiest day of the week. You know, that day when you get done and you race to get home because all you want to do is lay back and relax! On the way home, go shopping. Why? You'll be in such a hurry that you'll be in and out! An act of Congress couldn't get you to stay in the store longer than you have to when you're in a hurry and the less time you spend, the less money you spend!
Kick the brands.
Brand management is an awesome thing for companies. With a more well-established brand that people recognize, companies are able to charge more money for their products. Granted, sometimes more money for extra quality is warranted. However most of the time, there's no difference in quality between the option that costs $5 and the option that costs $7.50.
Next time you go shopping, instead of buying your favorite brand of something, switch it up and buy the store brand. If you find it's just as good, you'll naturally go for that choice every time from then on because we naturally want quality for less. Do this every time you shop and soon you'll be surprised at how many store brand items you'll come to know and love!
Carry $20 in cash.
There are few things that I need cash for these days. Most things I want, I can get by with my debit card. And because I feel more comfortable carrying my debit card than I do wads of cash, I recently figured out that I had created a bad habit for myself. I don't like using cash. So, I stopped carrying it. At least once a week, generally more often than that, I would find myself in apposition where I needed $5 or $10 to buy something from a street vendor, for example. I'd rush to the closest ATM and pay $3 to get $20 and go buy the item.
About a month ago, I started making sure I always had $20 cash on me. Now I never carry more and seldom carry less. I feel comfortable knowing that if I lose my wallet, I'm not losing a ton of money and in the last month alone, I've saved at least $12 on ATM fees .
Before I broke the numbers down, I wouldn't believe that people pay over five hundred bucks a year for coffee, but it's the truth. It's amazing how much money subtle lifestyle changes can save you in the long run.

Monday means heading back to work for most of America, but it also means it’s time for the Stream Team to go back to work. With the Monday MVP and Monday Single on tap, we have the opportunity to take big chunks of two prize pools if we hit on the right pitcher. Can we? One thing is for sure — after the Padres scored 35 runs over the weekend in Pittsburgh, I won’t be doing my “target the San Diego Triple-A team” schtick.
Monday
*Ace: Ryan Vogelsong, SF vs. PIT ($6,100). The good: Vogelsong still hasn’t given up more than three runs in a game since May 3. The better: he has a 1.30 ERA and 1.11 WHIP in 69.1 innings at home this year. The best: he’s taking on the fading Pirates, losers of their last 10 games. The 9-1 Vogelsong should move to double digits in wins as he continues his remarkable season.
Middle Man: Matt Harrison, TEX vs. SEA ($5,800). I wouldn’t consider going anywhere but Vogelsong today, but Harrison makes for a nice second banana. He’s been up and down lately, but he’s owned the Mariners in his career (2.84 ERA, 1.15 WHIP in 44.1 innings). His road/home splits aren’t drastic, so don’t worry about starting him in Texas today.
Wild Card: Tim Wakefield, BOS at MIN ($4,800). The Twins haven’t been hitting much lately, dropping their last four games by a combined score of 25-5. Wakefield has been no better than mediocre this year, but I’ll take him against the slumping offense if I’m really pinching pennies.
Roto Stream Team: 1. Tim Wakefield (at MIN), 2. Luke Hochevar (at TB), 3. Mike Pelfrey (vs. SD), 4. Jeremy Guthrie (vs. CWS), 5. Homer Bailey (vs. COL).
Tuesday
*Ace: Erik Bedard, BOS at MIN ($6,200). Bedard (pronounced bey-DAHD) wasn’t overpowering in his first start with the Red Sox, allowing three runs in five innings against the Indians. However, he did manage to punch out five batters without allowing a walk, astronomical progress from his first start off the DL (and his last with Seattle). Against the slumping Twins, he should be back to 100 percent.
Middle Man: Chris Capuano, NYM vs. SD ($5,400). Well, I can’t ignore the Padres completely. Capuano still checks in at a great price, and although he’s struggled over the past six weeks, he’s been on the road for most of it, only getting two home starts since a June 23 interleague game. With his strikeout total and his ability to work deep into games, I think he has a solid performance.
Wild Card: Jason Marquis, ARI vs. HOU ($5,200). Of course, I can still pick on the Astros. Marquis was atrocious in his first start with the Diamondbacks, but now that he’s facing the Corpus Christi Hooks in a game that shockingly counts in the standings, he should be much better. He went eight innings against the Astrs (omission of the letter “O” intentional) three starts ago, giving up just two runs while striking out nine batters.
Roto Stream Team: 1. Rich Harden (at TOR), 2. Chris Capuano (vs. SD), 3. Jason Marquis (vs. HOU), 4. Jeff Francis (at TB), 5. James McDonald (at SF).
Wednesday
*Ace: Jordan Zimmermann, WAS at CHC ($6,400). Zimmermann bounced back from two awful outings with two excellent games, striking out 14 batters in 11.2 innings of two-run ball. His 106:24 K:BB ratio is quite impressive — how many starting pitchers do you think have a higher K:BB ratio than Zimm? Just six: Roy Halladay, Dan Haren, Cliff Lee, Justin Verlander, Cole Hamels and Josh Tomlin.
Middle Man: Josh Collmenter, ARI vs. HOU ($5,800). He’s been knocked around in his last two starts, but a game against Houston should cure his woes. Collmenter in fact has pitched much better at home this year, going 5-3 in 11 games (seven starts) with a 33:7 K:BB ratio, 3.08 ERA and 0.87 WHIP.
Wild Card: Brad Mills, TOR vs. OAK ($4,200). Mills stunk up the joint in brief cups of Canadian coffee over the past two years, but he’s been very solid this time around. He posted just two runs in seven innings against the Rangers in his first start before picking up a win in Baltimore after allowing three runs in 5.1 innings. He’s struck out 10 batters in 12.1 innings, quite a good rate for our purposes. If you want to gamble a bit, Mills is your guy.
Roto Stream Team: 1. Josh Collmenter (vs. HOU), 2. R.A. Dickey (vs. SD), 3. Felipe Paulino (at TB), 4. Brad Mills (vs. OAK), 5. Aaron Harang (at NYM).
Thursday
Ace: Jeff Niemann, TB vs. KC ($7,200). Sure, the A’s may have touched Niemann up for four runs in his last start, but that doesn’t mean he had a bad game. In fact, with a win, 8.2 innings and eight Ks to his credit, it was actually a very successful FanDuel start. It was the third time in his last four appearances that he racked up at least eight Ks, and he’s 4-0 with 42 Ks in his last six starts. So, yeah, I’ll go with him again when he takes on the Royals.
Middle Man: Joe Saunders, ARI vs. HOU ($6,100). I’m not even going to try and defend Saunders as a fantasy pitcher. Astros all the time, baby.
*Wild Card: Cory Luebke, SD at NYM ($5,700). My new favorite streamer had come back down to Earth considerably after his hot start, but he was up to his old tricks again in his last game. He went into Pittsburgh and allowed one run in seven innings while striking out nine batters and issuing no walks. You cannot stop Cory Luebke, New York. Don’t even try.
Roto Stream Team: 1. Cory Luebke (at NYM), 2. Joe Saunders (vs. HOU), 3. Mark Buehrle (at BAL), 4. Jon Niese (vs. SD), 5. Danny Duffy (at TB).

SAUL007Did somebody say “tournament?”
Published:
It wasn't quite Jim Mora screaming "PLAYOFFS!" Or an Iverson rant on "PRACTICE. WE'RE TALKING PRACTICE" but there was some anticipation on how UO coach Dana Altman was going to respond when asked by a television reporter on Wednesday about this Oregoon team going to "the tournament."
It was a clear reference to a berth in the 68-team NCAA field, an obvious goal for about every team in the country.
There was a pause before Altman answered, and then came his reply: "We're going to a tournament in December (hosted by the Ducks) and we've got the conference tournament."
Clearly, though, there are raised expectations with this Oregon basketball team, a common theme when reporters met with Altman and some of his players during an availability on Wednesday. Here's a link to the story in the Thursday edition of The Register-Guard:
The Ducks open practice officially on Friday, appearing at a promotional event that begins at 8 p.m. in Matthew Knight Arena. If attending, please bring a donation to Food for Lane.On Tue, 2006-07-18 at 20:11 -0700, Ron Castro wrote:

We purchased our piano nearly a year ago and are extremely happy with the piano and the service provided. The owners are honest, attentive, and knowledgable. Their service continues well after the purchase of the piano and they make sure the piano is as good as when it was purchased. If you are looking for a new or used piano, this is the place to go!Heather K, from Evanston, IL on Yelp
Dan is the man! I went here with a budget and he showed me many used pianos in my range. All of them were nice, not those junky ones that the new piano dealers show you to make you buy a new one. I had been looking at used pianos for over a year when I went here. After awhile you just don’t get your hopes up because finding a good used piano is like finding the holy grail. There are lots of used pianos out there, but not many in good shape. Sure they look nice on the outside, but like a car there are many moving parts inside and unless you know your stuff, you can end up with a piece of junk. Dan and his partner take pride in all items in their showroom. They have rebuilt and refurbished Steinways and other top of the line items, and they have the middle of the road pianos as well. These guys know their music as well as the pianos and they can sit down and play for you. Today I got my piano and I am so happy! I wish every shopping experience was this great!
very nice pianos.
I went to Heavenly Pianos and explained to Jim, the sales manager, what I thought my needs were and the approximate amount I wanted to spend. Jim showed me used pianos from the bottom to the top of my price range, played them all for me and answered the questions I had before I even asked them. There was absolutely no pressure to purchase, but rather concern to fill my needs. No “used car salesman” tactics here. I left there with all the information on three pianos that I might be interested in.

(credit: Thinkstock)
DETROIT (WWJ) – If you love your apple cider, but aren’t prepared to pay a premium, it appears you’re in luck.
Following last year’s devastating loss of almost the entire crop, 2013 is one thousand percent better — literally.
Diane Smith, Executive Director of the Michigan Apple Committee, says the weather was perfect for apple growing this year.
She said Michigan is expecting to harvest 30 million bushels of apples this year — well above average for the state.
“Which is fantastic news considering the problems we’ve had with last year’s crop,” Smith told WWJ Newsradio 950. “We are feeling great about it. I will say, it was a really, really tough year last year, losing the crop that way.”
So, what made the difference?
“Well, we didn’t warm up in March like we did last year,” Smith explained. “Everybody was wearing shorts in March last year … and so excited. And this year it was actually cold — and that’s how it’s supposed to be in March, so the apples didn’t wake up too early.”
Nationwide, apple experts say this year’s crop will be the twelfth largest in history.
Last fall, apple cider sold for up to $10 at Southeast Michigan cider mills. Prices are expected to fall at least back to normal this year: around $7.
Michigan is the third largest producer of apples in the U.S., .behind only New York and Washington state.

From Barry Hugman's History of Championship Boxing,.In celebration of this new release I will be giving away one copy of Huntress by Malinda Lo.
First off, the cover is fantastic. The artwork is pristine and sets the mood before the book is even cracked. According to yayayas.wordpress had African American boys or girls pictured on the front cover Don’t get me started, but this is a hot topic to discuss another time, needless to say the cute young white girl covers are tragically overdone.
OK I'm done preaching (for now).
The fantasy world of the Huntress is the same as her first novel, ASH, but in a different time period. It is a small group’s an epic journey to visit the Faery Queen and find out why the land has fallen into an endless winter. The two main girls have to grow up fast in order to survive the trip. I sensed the trouble they were getting into right from page one. Malinda’s writing style flows smoothly with great internal dialog.
MY FAVORITE PART: The magic! Malinda says, “The magic system in Huntress is based in Taoism and Chinese philosophy. I actually have a master’s degree in East Asian Studies with a focus in Chinese anthropology, so it was a lot of fun to dig out some of my old books and academic articles. I read additional material, too, about Chinese medicine, divination, and meditation. I probably could have continued doing research for a lot longer than I did, since I love it so much.” As quoted on It is nice to know a fantasy book has research in it. It makes the magic real. Like Kung Fu Hussle.
MY LEAST FAVORITE PART: It was hard to attach myself to the characters. The book is written in an omniscient point of view. I felt like I had to spread myself between three or four people instead of just one. It made the romances hard to believe, not because one couple was gay, but because seeing it from both sides diminished the mystery of it. There is no anticipation when I already know what they are both thinking.
It would be neat if Malinda carried on with her setting in another time with another set of characters. It’s a great way to gain a following.
So, who wants to win this book? Be a follower, tweet it, and buy my book (na, just kidding, but you could give me a vote on wattpad) then leave a comment.

Tips and troubleshooting.Anne G. Keen
Anne G. Keen Anne G. Keen, 97, a Vero Beach community leader and citrus grower, died Wednesday morning, July 31, at Hospice House in Vero Beach. The daughter of early Indian River County pioneers Leon and Lillie Robertson Gollnick, Anne was born May 12, 1916, on the farm on Citrus Road (now 4th Street), where she lived most of her life. Vero Beach was "an idyllic place to grow up," she told an interviewer. Anne was valedictorian of Vero Beach High School's Class of 1934 and graduated from Stetson University in Deland in 1938 with a BS in Commercial Subjects. After returning to Vero in 1938, she taught bookkeeping and business at VBHS. In 1941, she married Joel Keen, whom she had met in Gainesville while studying for her teaching certificate at the
University of Florida
. A Captain in the U.S. Army Air Force during
WWII
, Joel died in 1947. Anne raised two children, Joel, Jr. and Barbara, while managing the family's citrus business. She also taught adult shorthand and typing classes and worked as a substitute teacher at VBHS. As one of the many newspaper articles about her noted, for many years Anne's spare hours were "not really spare." She served on numerous boards, including the Florida State Welfare Board, the Indian River Farm Bureau, the Girl Scouts of Indian River County, the Beautification Society of Vero Beach, and the Vero Beach Public Library, including as Secretary during the years of planning and fundraising for the new library on 20th St. She was a Life Member of the General Federation of Women's Clubs, and served as the President, Vice-President, and Secretary. She was Director of the 10th District of the Florida Federation of Garden Clubs and was named a Life Member in recognition of her service to the Garden Club of Indian River County, which she served as President, Parliamentarian, and Treasurer. She was Noble Grand of the Rebekah Assembly of Fort Piece, a member of the Zeta Tau Alpha and Phi Beta Psi social sororities, and of Delta Kappa Gamma, the education professional society. She was extremely proud of her participation in the Indian River Historical Society and its restoration of the Vero Beach Train Station. She was serving as its president in 1986-7 when the station was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. As an extraordinarily active and valued member of her community, she was honored as Woman of the Year in 1964 by the Vero Beach Business and Professional Women's Club. Anne's engaging smile, sunny nature, and ready laugh were beloved by all. She was devoted to her son, Joel P. Keen, Jr., and his wife, Faye, of Vero Beach; her daughter, Barbara K. Parker, and her husband, Daniel, of Fairfax, VA; and seven grandchildren and eleven great- grandchildren. Friends may call at Cox-Gifford Seawinds Funeral Home on Monday, August 5, 11 AM - 1 PM. Services follow at the funeral home at 1 PM. Burial will be in Crestlawn Cemetery. In lieu of flowers friends may make a contribution in memory of Anne to the Indian River Historical Society, the Garden Club of Indian River County, or an organization of their choice. Arrangements are under the direction of Cox Gifford Seawinds Funeral Home and Crematory in Vero Beach, FL. Online condolences may be sent at

Okay so, this was fantastic, and I thoroughly enjoyed myself for about an hour.
I got a friend to install the game after telling him how awesome it was playing on the game of thrones map, we decided we wanted to play together and then we went to host a game. Here's where you completely ruined your game - you have to PAY, with REAL MONEY, to host a game of this, being that with these types of strategy game finding players is hard enough, you've built a wall that stops players from creating games altogether! I was sorely disappointed, in the game, in the poor marketing decision.
Altogether the game is a definite 9/10 on gameplay, the customisable maps and unit types that people can add in to remake scenarios is brilliant, I love it, I love the game, I love the chat systems, I love the battles.
I just hate the fact you want people to buy a "game option package" to host a game. In my eyes this has completely destroyed my view of the overall product. Poor producers often destroy a product. Take a look at War Z and how sergei titov completely ruined a game that had potential by overhyping it and promising deadlines he couldn't keep. He even ended up writing an apology letter about it.
You can always ask a premium player to open a specific game for you. I know that most people wouldn't mind doing that. Also you can buy specific packs separatly if you dont wish to buy full premium and they will last forever.
i agree about the good stuff you said about the game, in my opinion AW is like one of the best online strategy browser game i ever played, and i played alot of browser games believe me.
it look like you dislike the way its because the game creators need to get some revenue from this game after wasting non stop for this game to maintain it, then its not so good anymore?.
i think non payers still have a good deal, because they are able to play games for free and use their available sp to purchase upgrades and stuff..
non payers:
1.)they are allowed to play any kind of custom map.
2.)have almost all the basic game features apart from the desired ones that are kept to be used for premiums.
as long as you didnt paid cash and saw the difference from premium to non premium dont say such things about the game, and if you want a to play custom map as non payer member ask nicely from the players to make a map you want and i am sure they will be glad to help you in this tinny issue, or pay to have map/scenario pack, it cost few cents and it will help the game alot, just dont leave such wonderful game because of of tiny problems that you cause..
No, you didn't read my review. I mentioned that they had to come up with an alternative revenue source that didn't limit a player's experience and subsequently the enjoyment of the game.
Disapointing you can't enjoy it. Although, free to play players can join ANY of the non private custom maps (Game of Thrones being one of these) which happen frequently per hour. This is not Pay to Play and ProtoBytes will do everything to avoid that. I think the prolonged (over 3 years now) strong free to play membership is evidence of such a thing.
I did enjoy it, to the extent that I was allowed to.
It's like someone giving you a bite of a cookie for free, then making you pay for the rest of THAT cookie. My alternative was to propose that they give you that whole cookie, then offer you another cookie if you enjoyed the first one. A somewhat dodgy metaphor but I think it works.
Overall rating of the game is a 4/10, purely because you have to pay to play.
Gameplay (when you can find a game) - 9/10.
Music - 7/10
Sound effect(s) - 4/10
Chat system - 7/10 - easy to use, have to click the chat box to talk every time you finish troop movement, rather than pressing enter as with most games.
Graphics - 9/10 for this type of game, they are better than is to be expected from the genre of riskesque games.
Ease of game hosting and playing with friends - 1/10 - if you're lucky you can join a game with a friend before the 5 turn limit, but don't think about making any private games for you and your friends, that'll cost you money.
I believe you shouldn't have to pay to host. There should be something else, such as a general system, an avatar you can attach to units to give bonuses and you can buy items for the general to equip him with different abilities (nothing overpowered, just like +1 attack +2 defence, etc.)
There are alternative options such as an item transaction store, rather than forcing players to pay to enjoy the game to it's full extent.
I hope you take my -somewhat- review seriously and review an alternative method that makes the game free-to-play with a paid option, nothing like it is now - pay-to-play.
I disagreed with you with that statement ‘purely because you have to pay to play.’
This, in my opinion, is free to play because there are a lots of games to join with your friends to play world maps, Europe maps, custom maps etc without having to pay.
atWar doesn’t force players to enjoy the game to its full extent. You will notice that there is a lot of non-premium* players at high ranks (takes a long time to rank up) and they still love playing atWar.
Sure you have to pay to host games but it doesn’t mean it will prevent you playing with your friends and there are usually games to join that you can play with your friends with you instead having to host games.
You can even ask in the lobby for a specific game you want to play, even private games! You may have to ask more than once sometimes though.
atWar will get more popular, means it will have more games.
If you really love atWar, you should consider buying premium. It will be worth it because I bought it myself : )
P.S. atWar is one of the best games I ever played, 10/10.
*Premium players who have bought packages such as game option package.
Sure you have to pay to host private games*(Metal & Dust Recordings)
The London Trio follow up their debut single ‘Hey Now‘ with the equally mesmerising ‘Metal And Dust’. The beautiful stripped back vocals of Hannah Reid in the beginning, simply complimented by sliding guitar works perfectly. Then in comes the shuffling percussion, with a cool air of Massive Attack, to tie it all together into a sublime, slow building finish.
The band are busy recording new material and putting the finishing touches on their live act, which I hope be able to see. I fully expect them to be featuring at a few festivals this year so keep your ears to the ground.
This track was selected as a hottest record in the world for Zane Lowe and with good reason. A wonderful follow up to their etherial first offering.

Remember Me is an important and colorful slap in the face to the status quo that deserves more attention, if only because it does what so many of my favorite videogames have done in the past.
Speaking with Siliconera, DontNod Entertainment’s co-founder and creative director, Jean-Maxime Moris, explains the world and story of Remember Me.
A new live-action trailer for Remember Me provides a brief backdrop of the story from the point of view of Antoine, the founder of Memorize.
What’s Remember Me all about? Well,it is the year 2084 (one hundred years removed from 1984, which is no coincidence, I was told by a Capcom rep) and memories appears to be as precious as gold, perhaps more so.
Pre-ordering Remember Me in North America adds the Flash Kick, Spinning Bird Kick and Dragon Punch to Nilin’s moveset.
Creative director Jean-Maxime Moris talks about the game’s backstory and also provides a few details on Nilin and her abilities.
Lost Planet 3 has been delayed, Capcom have announced. The game will now be released in August.
A new trailer for Capcom’s Remember Me shows the game’s protagonist, Nilin, facing off against enemy types from the “Memorize” corporation.
Dontnod and Capcom’s game where you play as a “memory hunter” has a release date and a new trailer.
Capcom will not be holding their annual “Captivate” event this year, the publisher’s senior Vice-President, Christian Svensson, has confirmed.
Capcom have released a large batch of new screenshots for Remember Me, the game where you play as a “memory hunter” in Neo-Paris.Distance

It can be quiet and fragrant or possibly still bustling, depending on where you decided to go. Getting a picture of a campus during the summer can be relaxing and reassuring as you find your way around your future home-away-from-home. Bring a friend from home to make a day of it–this can help introduce current friends into new parts of your life. Explore the city and areas just outside of campus, too!
Grab some swag
While you’re enjoying a nice summer day around campus, check out the college bookstore. Odds are you’ll want to rep your school once you’re in, so you might as well check out the goodies while they’re still in stock. Beat the crowds and get your stuff early! a great way to break the ice.
Set good habits
It’s okay to worry about the freshman 15 if you think about it in a healthy way. Don’t be afraid of gaining weight; instead, be proactive and start making some good habits! Switch out at least half your normal soda/sugary drink intake with water, have healthy snacks on hand (we all snack, denying that will only lead to unhealthy snackage), and start moving every day. Even if you can’t get to a gym during the summer, being active will help you prepare for school and maybe even help you stay motivated to go to the university gym once classes start!
Meet your roommate
Once you get your future roommate’s information, make contact and if you don’t live too far away, set up a meet and greet over something you both have an interest in. If you live on opposite sides of the country, or perhaps even the world, set up a Skype call! You’ll be spending a large amount of time with your roommate(s), so it’s best to get to know them early and find what you have in common. While you’re talking to your future roommate, collaborate on dorm supplies. There’s no need for you both to bring a futon if you’re only going to have room for one! It’s worked for me in the past to set up a Facebook chat just dealing with dorm needs, keeping a line of communication always open.
Shop for your dorm
Once you’ve got a mutual list of things that you’ll need, head straight to the store! You can never start acquiring things too early for your dorm, because things will definitely keep popping up until the last minute, and you don’t want to be strapped for time buying a hamper instead of exploring the campus on your first days with your new roommate. Although there will be countless items to buy in order to thrive in what usually amounts to a house in one room, these are some important basics:
- Towels
- Shower caddy
- Pillows
- Sheets
- Mattress pad
- Quilt/blankets
- Loft or futon if desired
- Desk lamp
- Garbage can
- Extension cords (can never have too many, really)
- Laundry hamper
- Hangers
- Storage containers
- Cereal bowls (college staple!)
- Cups
This definitely does not cover everything, but it’s a good start. Make your own list of things you want to buy and keep it in plain sight–stick it to the fridge or make a note in your phone so you always have it with you.
July
Take stock of your existing credits
Whether you took AP Calculus or Intro to Psychology, figure out which credits will transfer to your school. Transferring credits will save you time AND money– a win-win. From here, you will know what classes you don’t need to take and can get a step ahead of other students who don’t transfer credits.
If you haven’t done so already, July is usually the time for incoming freshman to sign up for the classes. Do this as soon as possible–after the upperclassmen register, it’s first come, first serve. If you’re unsure of what you need to take for your major, or unsure of what your major will be, it’s not a problem. If you want to get some gen-eds (general education classes) out of the way, you can go that route, too. One of the most exciting and terrifying things about college is the ability to choose what classes you’re going to take and when you’re going to take them.
Schedule an appointment with your adviser
If you don’t know where to start with classes, this is an excellent way to find some solid academic ground to stand on. Some universities have boards of advisers, some have individually assigned advisers, and some even let you pick your own. Regardless of how you find your adviser, set up an appointment with them (if you haven’t done so already!) to figure out your strengths (can be as simple as–are you an early riser? Schedule classes now to cater to your sleeping habits, if possible), goals, possible career plans, and therefore which classes would be best for you throughout your college career.
Adjust sleeping habits
We all have a certain rhythm we get into in the summer even if that just happens to be the “stay up til two and sleep til one every day” rhythm. Classes can be a rude wake-up call, literally, if you don’t prepare. You can start this as early as you want, but realistically, a couple of weeks or a month can go a long ways. Start going to bed a little earlier every night and getting up a little earlier in the morning every day. This is a life saver for those of you who signed up for 8 AM classes–trust me. Keep in mind that you can use your REM cycle for more efficiency; sleep in 90-minute or three-hour increments. Use the month to find out what works best for you–six, seven-and-a-half, or nine hours. This can help you get better sleep and wake up feeling rested!
August
College/party education
Seriously, start Googling. Freshman year may feel like an extension of senior year, but with the company of college seniors it’s going to be quite a bit different. Regardless of your intentions at the beginning of the year, parties happen, and chances are that you’ll attend one. Now, don’t consider this an invitation to drink (illegally, I might add), but if you are pressured into drinking at a party–be safe about it! Drink plenty of water, don’t accept drinks from strangers, and employ the buddy system–bring a friend you can rely on and check in with each other regularly. If you want to be proactive about it, grab a cup at a party and drink juice or water. There’s no shame in it and you can still have a great time.
Learn how to do laundry
Seems pretty simple in theory. Maybe even offer to do the laundry for a month for the household–everyone could use the practice! Visit your intended dorm or read up on it in a brochure or online to figure out where you’ll be able to do laundry. Some dorms have machines on each floor, just one floor, some are coin-operated, some free. It’s good to know ahead of time if you’ll be needing dozens of quarters.
Research college clubs
Besides orientation, joining clubs (including sports, music, etc.) is the absolute fastest way to throw yourself into the mix and meet people with similar interests (aka potential future BFFS). If you’re into sororities/frats, look those up. If not, there are dozens (if not hundreds) of other things to choose from. Search your school’s website for a directory and contact the person/people in charge to find out more about groups you are interested in joining.
Set a budget
Whether you will have a job off campus, have work study, have funds saved up, or will rely on loans, it’s incredibly important to realize that for the next few years, you will be largely on your own for spending. Many colleges have financial workshops to help you understand what you’re getting into for loans, but there is also the aspect of what you’ll personally be spending. Figure out how much money you will have extra each month (or week, or day, whatever works for you) and stick to your plan. Being frugal now can save you in the future.
Set goals
Find out what areas you would either like to improve on or to stay on top of–being in class on time, going to every class, eating right, exercising, making time for homework, work, friends, etc. There’s a lot of areas you can focus on, but you should set specific goals for yourself for the semester and the year so you have something to work toward.
Make plans to stay in touch
It can be really easy to get caught up in the rush of freshman year–meeting tons of new people, getting into the swing of classes, having a bunch of freedom living (sort of) on your own, and more. It can also be really easy to lose touch with current friends–if you want to keep old friends and new, plan for it! Schedule some phone or Skype calls, or have movie nights every now and then, or even write letters to each other to keep in touch.
GO!
When the months are up, which will happen much faster than you expect, get up and go! College can be the greatest time if you prepare and put a little effort into it. Follow this guide and you will be ready for college when the time finally comes.

Really enjoyed this recipe. Not sure I'd include the worcestershire and hot sauces again as they struck an odd chord with us, but probably cause I've been making something very much like this recipe without them and we're not used to this version. Great with anything grilled!

So don't listen to a word she's said.May 21, 2015Appearing before Opel’s best and brightest in Germany, General Motors CEO Mary Barra proclaimed her company’s European brand, though unprofitable, is a vital one for the General.
Last year, GM announced they would invest $5.5 billion through 2016 to fund the development of 23 new models and 13 new engines to aid in the overhaul of Opel’s aging lineup, with president Dan Ammann — responsible for global regions under Barra — being nominated as supervisory board chairman at Opel. The automaker is also holding firm on plans to build an all-new vehicle for Opel’s main factory in Germany, all in an effort to help the brand return to profitability by the middle of the 2010s.
In turn, GM recently withdrew Chevrolet from Europe to give Opel more breathing room, as well as planning to shutter Opel’s plan in Bochum, Germany by the end of 2014. Meanwhile, the Ruesselsheim will be assigned a new model sometime down the line to go with the Insignia and Zafira Tourer.
European sales of Opel and Vauxhall fell 1.5 percent in 2013 to 825,000 units, while market share held at 6.7 percent. The duo are the third-largest brand behind Volkswagen and Ford.

We did an event at Apollo where he did a molecular cooking presentation. I am not sure if I buy everything Giovanni Apollo presented, but it was entertaining nonetheless. The meal served was very good, with exception of the main course.
The presentation included:
Flourless pasta, which was a tomato reduction with Agar agar used to gel the liquid.
Chlorophyll oil -
Lemon infused olive oil
The extraction of 'Pineapple Enzyme' to be used as a tenderizer.
And I can't remember the rest of them.
The meal started with a melon juice topped with a prosciutto foam
mousse de Foie gras
I forget the next couple courses,
a Veal tenderloin tenderized with the 'pineapple enzyme' topped with a gremolatta.
and the dessert was an absolutely fabulous porcini ice cream with a mushroom creme brule.
Believe it or not, the Porcini Ice cream was soo good I had dreams of bathing in it...
The veal was over cooked and dry, but the gremolatta was made with gritty parsley. When I told Giovanni Apollo about the grit, he told me that I was clearly mistaken, that the grit was crystalization formed in the veal by the pineapple enzyme... Small problem, The grit was there when I tried the gremolatta without any veal.
Aside from the grit, all was enjoyable.
- re: JES000000
Molecular gastronomy doesn't necessarily mean a whole different cuisine. While there might not be a Ferran Adria, a Heston Blumenthal, a Grant Achatz or a Willie dufresne here in Montreal, ie. a chef or restaurant whose cuisine is entirely devoted to innovation, new techniques and surprising dishes for the sake of it, there are however many chefs who experiment, add a playful touch here and there, or who use a new technology for a desired effect without necessarily announcing it on their menu. Some chefs like to say sous-vide or foam or hydrocolloid on their menu, others decide to just let the melting texture of the chicken or that extra layer of flavour punch or the surprising presentation speak for themselves. Look in any of the top kitchens here (Bronte, Toqué, Laloux, others mentioned above) and they are dabbling somewhat, but few want to define themselves by it. I'm sure newbies will arrive on the scene and do it outright, but in the meantime if you want to blow your mind with edible utensils and meat glue and 'everything that is strange and new', then you have to go to New York or Chicago or something. Maybe we have too much tradition here, so we're slow in jumping on the bandwagon. In any case, it doesn't mean that there still isn't alot of it going on here under your nose. If a cook uses an induction element as apposed to a gas oven, or lightens his/her froth with lecithin instead of eggwhite or applies flavour in an untraditional way, he/she doesn't necessarily feel the need to alert the media. In my mind, that's when it's done best. Otherwise, I want to go to the temples for the full experience, as in chez the leaders mentioned above.. Then it's theatre, as apposed to dinner. So go there, or eat happily at any of Montreal's top restaurants and try to spot the molecular gastronomy.Hester Basoeki Garden Guest House operates two guest houses located respectively in Cilandak Barat, South of Jakarta with 10 rooms and in the village of Cihideung Udik-Ciampea, Bogor with 10 rooms. This village resort is well known also as “Kampoeng Wisata Cinangneng”, Ciampea-Bogor.
The guest houses offer range of opportunities for exploring the need of a Community Based Tourism Development and especially at “Kampoeng Wisata Cinangneng”, many interesting programmes are available and designed to give its guest the chance to discover and learn about the Sundanese culture and its society being the people from the village. Both individual and group programmes are available. Special programme called “Poelang Kampoeng” or “Back to the Village” programme can be arranged to suit the interest of individual or in-group.
HB Garden Guest Houses run by me with the fundamental philosophy “SMALL is BEAUTIFUL”. My initial effort was utilize a vacant room at my home and turn that being one room guest house in the early beginning. HB Garden Guest House in Jakarta started in 1992 and in 1994 I set up the guest house in Cihideung Udik-Ciampea Bogor which is a small village now becomes very popular under the name of KAMPOENG WISATA or VILLAGE TOURISM ‘’ CINANGNENG’’.
Philosophy behind HB Garden Guest House “Small is Beautiful” and my basic principal mirrors this theme. The wishes and interest of the tourist should be in harmony with the ability HB Garden Guest House will provide and that their holiday have been what they had imagined it would be.
Unlike tourist staying in big hotels or in conventional tourist spots anywhere in the world, the foreign and or local guests who are visiting HB Garden Guest House either they are staying as an individual or participating in the “Poelang Kampoeng” tour program, they must truly experience what makes Village Tourism different from other holiday destination. My guests will eat, breathe, see and really feel they are living in the village and my aim is to give each guest as much information as wanted about the local lifestyle, the religion and its culture.
The best form of tourism practiced in the Village Tourism is based on a two-way relationships. I believe also that the local stake holder in the village should take the advantages created by tourism, they should share not only in financial ways contributed by the industry but also the practical ways. For example nearly all of the staff who works for HB Garden Guest House in Jakarta and in particular in Bogor comes from the Cinangneng and Cihideung-Udik Village and a part from earning salary they received a valuable education on how to run a clean and nice guest house as well as being proud as stake holder to show the beauty of their village.
Recognition of my efforts was given by the Minister of Cultural and Tourism, Governor of West Java.I have to say I miss blogging. I miss reading some of the wonderful blogs out there, and being able to put down my own thoughts/ramblings et al.

Blogging is hard for the same reasons like you mentioned. Some days I cannot even get to the PC. The iPhone is the best I can do! Lol.

Jonathan Clappison, 34, was eastbound on I-40 in a Ford Contour about 9 a.m. when he took Exit 73 and slid his car into the northwest corner of the Best Western Santa Fe, 4600 E. Interstate 40.
No one was injured, but Clappison was arrested on outstanding warrants unrelated to the accident.
Carlene Miller, manager of the hotel, was in the reception area when the car struck the building.
"I thought it was a sonic boom or something," Miller said.
The wreck caused damage to an exterior wall and to the hotel office, which included pushing a credenza several feet, dumping a computer and office supplies on the floor and scattering papers.
Miller estimated the damage at $18,000 to $25,000.

For example, a Communist Party official who was a top provincial campaigner against corruption was removed from his post after he was caught in a hotel room with a prostitute. China.[2] Venues typically include hotels, karaoke venues and beauty salons.
Officially, prostitution is illegal in mainland China.[3] The government of the People's Republic of China has vacillated, however, in its legal treatment of prostitutes themselves, treating them sometimes as criminals and sometimes as behaving with misconduct. Since the reappearance of prostitution in the 1980s,.
Following the Communist Party of China's victory in 1949, local government authorities were charged with the task of eliminating prostitution. One month after the Communist takeover of Beijing on February 3, 1949, the new municipal government under Ye Jianying announced a policy to control the city's many brothels. On November 21, all 224 of Beijing's establishments were shut down; 1286 prostitutes and 434 owners, procurers, and pimps were arrested in the space of 12 hours by an estimated 2400 cadres.[4] Not surprisingly, the Beijing campaign has been much celebrated in historical accounts.
Due to the enormity of social issues that had to be addressed, and the limited budgets and human resources of local governments, most cities adopted the slower approach of first controlling and then prohibiting brothel-prostitution.[5] This method was used in Tianjin, Shanghai and Wuhan.[6][7] Typically it involved a system of governmental administration which controlled brothel activities and discouraged male patrons..
By the early 1960s, such measures.
In accordance with Marxist theory, women who sold sex were viewed as being forced into prostitution in order to survive. The eradication of prostitution was thus vaunted as one of the major accomplishments of the Communist government and evidence of the primacy of Chinese Marxism.[8][9] Prostitution did not exist as a serious object of concern in China for a period of nearly three decades. Recent studies have demonstrated, however, that the disappearance of prostitution under the Maoist regime was far from complete.[10][11].[12].[13] Between 1989 and 1990, 243,183 people were apprehended for prostitution-related activities.[14] Zhang Ping estimates that such police figures only account for around 25–30 percent of the total number of people who are actually involved.[15] Prostitution is an increasingly large part of the Chinese economy, employing perhaps 10 million people, with an annual level of consumption of possibly 1 trillion RMB.[16] Following a 2000 police campaign, Chinese economist Yang Fan estimated that the Chinese GDP slumped by 1%, as a result of decreased spending by newly unemployed female prostitutes.[16]
The revival of prostitution was initially associated with China's eastern, coastal cities, but since the early 1990s at least, prostitution practices have also been widespread in the economic hinterlands, incorporating such remote and underdeveloped regions as Guizhou, Yunnan and Tibet..[17][18] The potential benefits of prostitution as an alternative form of employment include greater disposable income, access to upwardly mobile social circles and lifestyle options. The state-controlled media have focused attention on urban residents engaging in prostitution, especially university-educated women.[19] There also seems to be a growing acceptance of prostitution. In a 1997 study, 46.8% of undergraduates in Beijing admitted to having considered receiving prostitution services.[20] On the demand side, prostitution has been associated with the gender imbalances brought about by the one-child policy.[21]
Prostitution is often directly linked to low-level government corruption. Many local officials believe that encouraging prostitution in recreational business operations will bring economic benefits by developing the tourism and hospitality industries and generating a significant source of tax revenue.[22] On occasion, police have been implicated in the running of high grade hotels where prostitution activities occur, or accepting bribes and demanding sexual favours to ignore the existence of prostitution activities.[23] Government corruption is also involved in a more indirect form — the widespread abuse of public funds to finance consumption of sex services. Pan Suiming contends that China has a specific type of prostitution that entails a bargain between those who use their power and authority in government to obtain sex and those who use sex to obtain privileges.[24]
Apart from incidences of violence directly associated with prostitution, an increasing number of women who sell sex have been physically assaulted, and even murdered, in the course of attempts to steal their money and property.[25] There have also been a growing number of criminal acts, especially incidences of theft and fraud directed at men who buy sex, as well as bribery of public servants.[26] Offenders often capitalise on the unwillingness of participants in the prostitution transaction to report such activities. Organised crime rings are increasingly trafficking women into and out of China for the sex trade, sometimes forcibly and after multiple acts of rape.[27][28][29] Mainland China also has a growing number of "heroin hookers", whose drug addictions are often connected to international and domestic crime rackets.[30]
Sexually transmitted diseases also made a resurgence around the same time as prostitution, and have been directly linked to prostitution. There are fears that prostitution may become the main route of HIV transmission as it has in developing countries such as Thailand and India.[31] Some regions have introduced a policy of 100% condom use, inspired by a similar measure in Thailand. Other interventions have been introduced recently at some sites, including STI services, peer education and voluntary counselling and testing for HIV.[32][33]
Annually, thousands of Russian women end up as prostitutes in China.[2] Bars in major Chinese cities offer blond, blue-eyed Russian "hostesses".[34]
North Korean women are increasingly falling victim to sex exploitation in China attempting to escape poverty and harsh conditions in their homeland. About 10,000 women[35][36][37] (The Washington Post's Carol Douglas, however, claimed that the number was as high as 100,000[38]) are reported to have escaped from North Korea to China; according to human rights groups, many of them are forced into sexual slavery.
According to a Ji Sun Jeong of A Woman's Voice International, "60 to 70% of North Korean defectors to China are women, and 70 to 80% of whom are victims of human trafficking."[39] Chinese-fathered babies of theirs "to protect North Korean pure blood" and force abortions on all pregnant repatriates not executed.[39]
Chinese police categorise prostitution practices according to a descending hierarchy of seven tiers, though this typology does not exhaust the forms of practices that exist.[40] These tiers highlight the heterogeneous nature of prostitution and prostitutes. While they are all classified as prostitutes, the services they offer can be very different. Within some tiers, for example, there is still some revulsion to the acts of anal sex and oral sex. In parallel with the wide range of backgrounds for prostitutes, male buyers of sex also come from a wide range of occupational backgrounds.
The first and second tiers have become the focus of heated public debate because they are explicitly linked to government corruption. Many domestic commentators contend that these practices constitute a concrete expression of "bourgeois rights".[41] and economic surety of the marriage contract.[42]
The lowest two tiers are characterised by a more straightforward exchange of sex for financial or material recompense. They are neither explicitly linked to government corruption, nor directly mediated through China's new commercial recreational business sector. Women who sell sex in the lowest two tiers usually do so in return for small sums of money, food and shelter.
The PRC rejects the argument that prostitution is an unremarkable transaction between consenting individuals and that prohibition laws constitute a violation of civil liberties. Overall, the PRC's legal response to prostitution is to penalise third party organisers of prostitution. Participants in the prostitution transaction are still usually penalised according to the Chinese system of administrative sanctions, rather than through the criminal code.
Until the 1980s, the subject of prostitution was not viewed as a major concern for the National People's Congress. The PRC's first criminal code, the Criminal Law and the Criminal Procedure Law of 1979 made no explicit reference to the activities of prostitutes and prostitute clients.[43] Legal control of prostitution was effected on the basis of provincial rulings and localised policing initiatives until the introduction of the "Security administration punishment regulations" in 1987. The Regulations makes it an offence to "sell sex" (卖淫) and to "have illicit relations with a prostitute" (嫖宿暗娼).[44]
Prostitution only became a distinct object of statutory classification in the early 1990s..[45] Adding symbolic weight to these enhanced law enforcement controls was the 1992 Law on Protecting the Rights and Interests of Women, which defines prostitution as a social practice that abrogates the inherent rights of women to personhood.[46]
The PRC's revised Criminal Law of 1997 retains its abolitionist focus in that it is primarily concerned with criminalising third-party involvement in prostitution. For the first time the death penalty may be used, but only in exceptional cases of organising prostitution activities, involving additional circumstances such as repeated offences, rape, causing serious bodily injury, etc.[47][48] The activities of first-party participants continue to be regulated in practice according to administrative law, with the exceptions of anyone who sells or buys prostitutional sex in the full knowledge that they are infected with an STD; and anyone who has prostitutional sex with a child under 14 years of age.[49] Since 2003, male homosexual prostitution has also been prosecuted under the law.[50]
The 1997 criminal code codified provisions in the 1991 Decision, establishing a system of controls over social place, specifically places of leisure and entertainment.[51] The ultimate goal is to stop managers and workers within the predominantly male-run and male-patronised hospitality and service industry from profiting from and/or encouraging the prostitution of others. Government intervention in commercial recreation has found concrete expression in the form of the 1999 "Regulations concerning the management of public places of entertainment". The provisions proscribe a range of commercial practices that characterise the activities of female "hostesses".[52] These laws have been further reinforced via the introduction of localised licensing measures that bear directly on the interior spatial organisation of recreational venues.
As a result of strong calls to curb official corruption, during the mid to late 1990s, a whole host of regulations were also introduced to ban government employees both from running recreational venues and from protecting illegal business operations. The 1997 Communist Party Discipline Regulations, for example, contain specific provisions to the effect that party members will be stripped of their posts for using their position and/or public funds to keep a "second wife", a "hired wife", and to buy sexual services.[53] These measures are being policed via the practice established in 1998 of auditing government officials, and thereby combining the forces of the CPC's disciplinary committees with those of the State Auditing Administration. Following the introduction of these measures, the Chinese media has publicised numerous cases of government officials being convicted and disciplined for abusing their positions for prostitution.[54]. Arrests are also more likely to be female sellers of sex than male buyers of sex. The overwhelming majority of men and women who are apprehended are released with a caution and fine.[55].[56] Prostitutes have also begun using the internet, in particular instant messaging software such as QQ, to attract customers.[57] In 2004, PlayChina, an online prostitution referral service, was shut down by police. 1950s.[58]
The primary target of the PRC's prostitution controls throughout the 1990s has been China's burgeoning hospitality and entertainment industry. These culminated in the "strike hard" campaigns of late 1999 and 2000. Whilst such campaigns may have failed to eradicate prostitution.[59].[60] Police forces around China also differ as to how they approach the subject..[61] The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women reads: Art. 6: States Parties shall take all appropriate measures, including legislation, to suppress all forms of traffic in women and exploitation of prostitution of women. However, it does not advocate a system of legal and regulated prostitution. [1].[62] Domestic commentators have also been highly critical of the PRC's prostitution controls, with a consistent Marxist-informed focus of complaint being the gender-biased and discriminatory nature of such controls, as well as human rights abuses.[63] Some commentators in China and overseas contend that the PRC's policy of banning prostitution is problematic because it hinders the task of developing measures to prevent the spread of HIV.[64]
While prostitution controls have been relaxed at a local level, there is no impetus for legalisation at the central government level. Importantly, legalisation does not have much public support.[65] Given the underdeveloped nature of the Chinese economy and legal system, there is an argument that legalisation would further complicate the already difficult task of establishing the legal responsibility for third-party involvement in forced prostitution and the traffic in women.[66] Surveys conducted in China suggest that clandestine forms of prostitution will continue to proliferate alongside the establishment of legal prostitution businesses, because of social sanctions against working or patronising a red-light district.[67] Problems associated with female employment also limit the effectiveness of legalisation. These include the lack of independent trade unions, and limited access of individuals to civil redress with regard to occupational health and safety issues.[68]
According to UNAIDS, 1 in 200 Chinese sex workers are infected with HIV.[69] Another source estimates that 5% of low-cost sex workers in the country are infected.[70] In one part of Yunnan province, the infection rate is as high as 7% or 14 in 200. The Chinese government has initiated programs to educate sex workers in HIV/AIDS prevention.[69]
Rising HIV/AIDS rates among Chinese's elderly has been partially attributed to the use of sex workers.[70] 400 Japanese clients and 500 Chinese prostitutes in 2003, which partially because of anti-Japanese sentiment, was widely publicised and met with considerable outrage.[71] Another highly publicised case was that of Alex Ho Wai-to, then a Democratic Party candidate for the Legislative Council of Hong Kong, who was given a six-month re-education through labor sentence for hiring a prostitute.[72]
Prostitution has emerged as a subject of art in recent years, particularly in Chinese cinema. Li Shaohong's 1995 film Blush begins in 1949 1998 film Xiu Xiu: The Sent Down Girl was a dramatic portrayal of "invisible" prostitution in the rural China during the Maoist era. The 2001.[73]
In a 2009 poll by Insight China magazine, 7.9% of Chinese respondents said sex workers in the country were "trustworthy", ranking them third after farmers and religious workers.[74] | Homecoming

the Luminous Doctor
Following in the footsteps of Pope Saint Leo the Great and Pope Saint Gregory the Great, it is evident that history and Holy Mother Church herself will one day not only canonize our recently departed Pope John Paul II, but also impart the rare title of “the Great” as well as declaring him a Doctor of the Church. Before the Good Lord called the Servant of the Servants of God home at 9:37 pm on April 2nd (the vigil of Divine Mercy Sunday), Karol Jósef Wojtyła reigned as supreme Roman Pontiff for more than 26 years, made 104 international trips, beatified 1,338 and canonized 482 saints; authored 14 encyclicals, 15 apostolic exhortations, 11 apostolic constitutions, 45 apostolic letters, and five books.
Just as Saint Bonaventure is known as the Seraphic Doctor and Saint Thomas Aquinas as the Angelic Doctor, it stands to reason that John Paul II should be given the title Luminous Doctor or the Doctor of Light and Hope. The first words of his pontificate, “be not afraid” were mirrored by his prolific writings and speeches, his pastoral visits, his popular Word Youth Days, and his courageous battle with disease, illness, assassination attempt and old age. “Fear not” and “be not afraid” were spoken by the Archangel to Our Lady and to Saint Joseph prior to the birth of Jesus Christ who Himself uttered those sentiments to His disciples after the Resurrection when they thought they were seeing a ghost. Pope John Paul II dispelled the fear which crept into the church following the Second Vatican Council. Not that Vatican II caused the fear and doubt, but the powers of darkness successfully distorted and diluted the Council documents so as to promote the alleged ‘spirit of Vatican II’ rather than the ‘letter of Vatican II.’
Ultra-liberals called him an archconservative and ultra-conservatives thought he was not traditional enough, but John Paul II was not sympathetic to either classification of liberal or conservative, progressive or traditional. He was just orthodox. A true son of Vatican II, it was under his reign, at his command and with his guidance that the Church was given some invaluable and precious pearls which sadly some swine do not appreciate. He gave us the revised Code of Canon Law in 1983 which had not been updated since 1917. He gave us the Catechism of the Catholic Church in 1992 which was only preceded by the Catechism of the Council of Trent four centuries earlier. He gave us epic encyclicals like Redemptor Hominis, Mater Redemptoris, Ecclesia de Eucharistia, Laborem Exercens, Familiaris Consortio, and Ut Unum Sint but of all these, Evangelium Vitae, Fides et Ratio and Veritatis Splendor stand out as his greatest masterpieces and were the beacons of light which emanated the sublime truths of our Catholic religion. They alone warrant him the title Doctor of Light and Salvifici Doloris and his indefatigable courage to battle the Nazis, Communism, Secular Humanism, materialism, moral relativism, sexual permissiveness, et al., merit him the title Doctor of Hope.
I was in High School Seminary when he was elected Pontiff in 1978. The first two years were during the final years of the then ailing and aged Pope Paul VI. Vocations were declining, Mass attendance and confessions were dropping, dissident theology was proliferating Catholic colleges and seminaries, and other cancers were infecting the church for several years after Vatican II. Tabernacles were hidden, religious garb was discarded, catechisms were watered down, sacraments and sacred liturgies were irreverently innovated and the faithful were raped of sacred art, orthodoxy and solid leadership in many corners of the world until a man was sent from God named “John Paul II.” Since his election as Bishop of Rome and 264th Successor of Saint Peter, JP2 has encouraged many vocations, conversions, reversions, and initiated a true Catholic Renaissance.
Sure, liturgical and doctrinal abuses continued in the sanctuaries, colleges, seminaries and sadly even in some rectories (where children were abused) but there has never been a period of human history where there is no sin and no evil. These aberrations would have occurred regardless of who was Pope at the time since human free will is not limited to one time or place and men of the church, just as men of the world, can freely choose good or evil. It is unfair and unjust to blame Pope John Paul for the clergy sex abuse scandal when it was the fault of the perverted clergy who actually committed the abuse of children and teenagers and the bishops and seminary faculties which looked the other way when these deviants were under their authority and supervision. Lex ordandi, lex credendi, lex agendi. Bad liturgy and bad theology will feed and support one another and will inevitably lead to bad morality and behavior. Liturgical abuses, dissident theology and heterodox doctrine will spawn moral depravity and other evils. At the same time, reverent (valid and licit) liturgy combined with orthodox theology (based on the Magisterium) will also promote and sustain pious and holy lives, for clergy, religious and laity alike.
Pope John Paul II was neither perfect nor impeccable but he was infallible as Pope and exercised his supreme teaching authority in Ordinatio Sacerdotalis which closed the debate once and for all on women’s ordination. He was human and had his weaknesses like the rest of us but he had more courage, piety, devotion, patience, prudence, intelligence, wisdom, compassion and integrity than anyone else of the last century. He gave the Church a banquet of truth in his teachings, much like the Summa of Aquinas which is even today still producing good fruit. Sadly, modern man and modern Catholics are content with the bare minimum of spiritual life support rather than feasting on the fullness of grace, truth and tradition Holy Mother Church offers and which was offered in an exquisite presentation by Pope John Paul II. It would be like someone opting to have an intravenous solution drip in their arm when the alternative would be a seven course gourmet meal with every vitamin, mineral and necessary nutrient inside.
When he gave the Church the five new Luminous Mysteries to the Holy Rosary, it also symbolized the light of hope he brought to the Church during his 26 year pontificate. Our loss is heaven's gain.

As shown in the photograph above, designer fences are the personal boundaries that yard artists create to identify the reasonable, safe and permissible ways for other people to behave around him or her, and how he or she will respond when someone steps into his or her yard. According to the American Fence Association, there are four types of designer-fence boundaries...
The Stars and Bars designer fence pictured above is located in the Westwood neighborhood and was created by a yard artist with rigid personal boundaries. These types of fences are usually created by persons who have easy access to low-cost scrap metal, leftover cement and small rocks.
Rigid fence designers can be selective, depending on quantities of materials and previous experiences in mixing rocks and cement to form stars. These yard artists are also physically dependent on others to help them lift and weld two-ton stars onto bright-blue bars.
Below, the holiest of all yard artist personal boundaries...
The designer fence in the photograph above was created by a yard artist with porous personal boundary issues. The holes cut into the security fence to display selections of hand-blown glass suggests that this yard artist is unsure about what to let in and what to keep out. Below, the most healthy of all the personal boundary fences...
The personal boundary designer fence pictured above surrounds a home in Denver's Rosedale neighborhood. This is the zen-like ideal. By using selective rigid materials to to highlight organic boundaries, this yard artist exhibits mastery and control of both the natural and man-made environment.

This is something which has to be brought to the surface area – and as soon as you have the ability to access this part of your mind, it will take time to learn to manage it.
Persistence as well as technique are key.In a way, it’s like learning a 2nd language. At first, it seems as if you’ll never ever master it as well as it’s simple to become disappointed yet with time and devotion, it eventually ends up being a natural methods of expression as you gain fluency. When you have a buddy to exercise with, you can supply each other the assistance and motivation you have to stick with it.
Do not quit with people you recognize nevertheless. Folks with sophisticated telepathic capacities could also send signals to finish unfamiliar people. You can begin to enhance your telepathic interaction by focusing on casual associates, colleagues, next-door neighbors as well as others who you enter normal contact with. Take note of when these people are experiencing extreme feelings and you could have the ability to pick up ideas or words from their mind. Telepathy, like numerous other skills based after techniques that are psychically oriented, is something the majority of us could do, yet just don’t know how telepathy could most effectively be installed. Just what is it? Telepathy is the capability to connect with others by making using of the powers of your mind rather than with common methods of interaction. When it comes to telepathy, how communication is done is by directly moving your sensations, sensations, ideas, ideas, emotions, or even psychological photos to others– all without speaking or doing various other normal kinds of communication.
While telepathy Training, one can likewise try broadcasting in order attempting at sending out a signal. Broadcasting describes psychologically yelling with your inner guide which usually contacts yourself the majority of the moment. Mentally scream what you want to communicate until you believe that a pressure on the peak of your head. In case of advanced telepathy training, tuning in and injecting thoughts without the second person’s authorization, consists of training on methods such as scanning and also probing. This mostly is possible for experienced individuals that have actually understood the fine art of extreme visualization and also control by themselves subconscious minds to send tendrils from the periphery of the very same. These tendrils then go in to the other’s mind and brush against it to check the thoughts therein or carefully press in the roots right into his mind for probing in for much deeper ideas or shot in the same.
Lastly, advanced telepathy training likewise consists of methods of pointers for pulse sending directions to an additional person like ‘Rest'; forecast to broadcast a tip to a particular region as an example in a bus; as well as lastly the technique of forced aberrations to regulate another’s mind and make himself view something that is really not there.
Among the important things that makes telepathy, how to do it, much easier is to be definitely present in the now, focused on whatever’s occurring as you’re doing it. One of the partners in your telepathic workouts must be the sender, as well as the various other must be the receiver. The individual sending the info needs to take one of the things of pictures each time then focus on sending out a picture of the item or picture to the receiver. If you do not want to concentrate on items or pictures, you could likewise just think of mind images, words, solid emotions, or colors. You ought to settle on a signal prior to you begin your exercises. The person doing the “sending” will concentrate on sending telepathic messages to the person getting them, and the receiver will certainly then concentrate on getting the details sent by the sender. The receiver ought to be definitely relaxed such that she or he will be absolutely open to whatever the sender is visiting send, consisting of photos, feelings, graphics, etc. The receiver can tape-record whatever she or he gets from the sender by creating it down. Or, a sender could merely claim that they is completed focusing on a certain product and afterwards the receiver can verbalize what they has actually viewed.
When you exercise telepathy, how you can do it, agree with your partner on a signal in advance. For instance, you can agree that you will simply concentrate on shades, to ensure that when the receiver states, “Done sending out,” or some other similar signal, the receiver can then claim the color aloud, such as “environment-friendly.” Then, the sender could simply say, “yes, or “no,” prior to relocating onto the next point.
The actual definition of telepathy is to read an individual’s mind as well as especially their thought and feelings. This is done not making use of words or expressions or any other mode of typical detects yet by utilizing some form of spiritual mode.
It is actually challenging to get a proof that exactly how it can be done. With couple of folks there are conflicts that think that it is almost difficult to analyze as well as review someone’s thought and feelings simply spontaneously. First right here I wish to talk with you concerning non spoken communication. Lots of visitors formerly asked me to speak on this subject. So below I am. If you are mom or daddy of a youngster or a spouse, then you could have knowledgeable something like this just before with your kids or companion when without making use of words or speech or hand motions you might interact with them. Generally, the facial and eyes expressions, are made use of to connect non-verbally. Body movement is yet one more method. You could share nearly anything and also every little thing using this non verbal method of interaction. Telepathy is possible simply making use of body movement and expression of eyes.On Sat, Nov 07, 2009 at 02:44:18PM +0100, Jerome Benoit wrote: > Hello, > > Like all major Linux distro, I really think Fedora should push security > updates information to full disclosure mailing list ...

There’s a Christian-based health care alternative that’s exempt from ObamaCare requirements, and it’s growing quickly in the United States.
'Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Is': Mom of Sick Teen Calls Out Harry Reid
It’s a national network of health care-sharing ministries, linking networks of Christians who share the costs of each other’s medical bills.
Fox News’ Garrett Tenney reported that members pay monthly premiums and have an annual deductible.
Eileen Wade has been a Medi-Share member since 2011. When one of her sons knocked his front teeth out, she took him to the doctor. Wade paid $100 out of pocket for her deductible and sent Medi-Share the remaining $1,200 in medical bills – all of which was covered by other members.
“They work just like insurance as far as I’m concerned, but it’s just a Christian option,” Wade said. “It’s actually cheaper than anybody that I know that’s on a normal insurance plan.”
Members agree to live “biblical lifestyles,” consisting of regular church attendance, no drugs, no sex outside of marriage, and limited alcohol consumption.
Since ObamaCare launched on October 1st last year, over 29,000 people have joined Medi-Share.
Tenney reported that the group is clear that it’s not technically a health insurance provider and the costs of regular doctor visits are not covered.
Critics are quick to point out that the group is not legally required to pay any bills.
Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA, said, “If you feel confident you’re not going to need health care and you’re not going to have a major problem, then maybe this could be alright. But I want insurance that truly insures, and this does not really guarantee that.”
Medi-Share says those concerns are exaggerated, Tenney reported. In the 21 years of sharing bills, it claims to have had only a handful of complaints.

The baseball world is still buzzing following Tuesday’s announcement of the 2014 Futures Game rosters, as this year’s collection of talent will feature as many familiar names and fresh faces.
Trying to determine when a player might arrive in the major leagues is an important part of evaluating prospects, as it forces one to consider a player’s future potential in relation to his organization’s current outlook.
Though call-ups during the season tend to be at least partially tied to a player’s preseason development timeline, there also are many unexpected promotions that come from out of nowhere. (Marco Gonzales, anyone?)
So when can fans expect to see this year’s Futures Game selections in the major leagues? Here’s a breakdown of each team’s roster complete with ETAs for every player.Facebook: Review Community Standards so that "humorous" racist posts are not allowed

Day.
Bad.)North America’s premiere traveling heavy music showcase once again invades the Toyota Pavilion at Montage Mountain on Aug. 2 for a full day’s worth of twisted debauchery - welcome to another installment of the Rockstar Energy Drink Mayhem Festival.
Now in its seventh season, the festival, founded by Vans Warped Tour mastermind Kevin Lyman and artist management guru John Reese, not only features established metal acts on its main stage, but also the best in venomous underground talent. In addition to main stage headline acts this year like Avenged Sevenfold and Korn, the Coldcock American Herbal Whiskey, Sumerian Records, and Victory Records stages will present face-melting aural assaults by death metal veterans Cannibal Corpse, rapper/actor Ice-T’s infamous hardcore band Body Count, and nu-metal mainstays Ill Nino among many others.
Basically, if you can’t satisfy the particular shade of sonic brutality you’re into at this show, keep walking, and forever surrender your metal street cred.
Hail To The Headliner.”
It’s clear from hearing the description of the game’s premise, and how the band performed their voiceovers, that they had a blast going through the process of design.
.”
As far as the audiences that Avenged has seen during their run on this festival tour, Gates said it proves that rock ‘n roll is far from dead in America.
.”
Korn Continues Road Dog Ethic
“It’s just non-stop,” laughed Korn drummer Ray Luzier as he spoke earlier this year, just before the official Rockstar Mayhem Tour announcement. “My brother-in-law and I were joking around the other day; he said, ‘You only work an hour and a half a day.’ I said, ‘No, you’re wrong. I work 22 and a half hours a day. When we’re on a bus or a plane for 11 hours, dealing with time changes; that’s the work. When I’m on stage, that’s a blast.”
Korn, like Avenged Sevenfold, is still touring in support of a successful album – “The Paradigm Shift,” released in October of last year and another Top 10 Billboard chart performer. Luzier, an accomplished session musician prior to joining the band in late 2007, is still challenged by the sheer emotional weight and intricacy of Korn’s music – something that he still relishes as a player.
“You don’t just join a band like Korn,” he said. “Being a session guy for a lot of my career, even before the David Lee Roth days (Luzier played drums for Roth during the late 1990s), I’d get a call and go play three songs a day for a pop record, then go play for some movie soundtrack. You become a chameleon and adapt to different styles and personalities. But man, there’s nothing like Korn.”
Luzier admired the sense of heart that the five founding members of the band mustered upon Korn’s formation some 20 years ago in Bakersfield, Calif. He says it’s that street-level drive that still propels the band today.
“It’s carved from the angst that came from the nineties,” he believes. “These bands were coming out like Alice in Chains and Soundgarden, the whole Seattle scene; and Korn just came out and f—ked everybody up. They sliced through and said, ‘This is what we’re about.’ No one plays guitar like Munky (James Shaffer, Korn guitarist) and Head (Brian Welch, Korn guitarist – recently returning to the band after a long departure). I was quite intimidated joining the band; it doesn’t matter how much experience I had, or what technique I had.”
“There were fans that had the original drummer’s face tattooed on their body,” he quipped, noting the level of dedication within the ranks of Korn fans. “I was showing up to the gigs and fans were like, ‘Who the hell are you?”
Now seven years in, Luzier is firmly entrenched in the Korn camp, and he couldn’t be happier with the chemistry. “The Paradigm Shift” displays this sense of creative comfort; not comfort in the going-through-the-motions aspect, but rather the intuitive, locked-in angle.
“We just wanted to see what we would come up with,” said Luzier of the band’s process this time around. “We said, ‘Hey, what can we come up with fresh?’ We started writing stuff and it just flowed. Sometimes when you get into a situation like that you never know. Everyone is just so focused on the band now; I think that had a lot to do with it. So, we ended up with 25 tunes, and then we decided to bring producer Don Gilmore in who really made the quality higher. I am really pleased; I think this is probably the best record in the last 10 years.”
“I told Jonathan (Davis, Korn vocalist), ‘I don’t know what place you are in right now, but I love it.’ There are harmonies and melodies all over. And, just because Brian is now back, if we had then made a second ‘Life Is Peachy,’ that would be truly boring and predictable. Why would we do that? We want to keep moving. I love being in a band that is not afraid to take chances.”
Korn’s “The Paradigm Shift” was just recently re-released in July with several new studio tracks and live cuts. Luzier is particularly fond of one of the new songs, “Hater,” which is typical Korn headstrong mantra.
“That track is a direct rebuttal to the kind of person the lyrics describe,” Luzier begins. “Everybody’s a hater; everybody has someone that hates on you because you have something they want. And it’s a very empowering song that Jonathan wrote because it’s just blatantly telling you, ‘You can’t bring me down.’”
Luzier is continuing to enjoy the live Korn experience, and there’s also been talk from Jonathan Davis that a new Korn record could happen sooner than later.
“We’re all in a great place, and doing the shows has just been incredible,” Luzier concluded. “We’re coming into the last stretch of it, and it’s been great. We’ve got some other cool things planned for the band’s twentieth anniversary that I can’t talk about yet, but it’s going to be great when it’s announced.”The Frisky picked out 10 great examples from Damn You Auto Correct. (Via Instapundit.) They had me screaming in hysterics with tears running down my face.
Looking to extend my hysteria, I went to the source blog (Damn You Auto Correct) and got pulled into a somber reverie by this one, where the question "How jealous are you?!" brings the response "Spool!" That was supposed to be "soooo!" The texters both hope that "Spool!" will become a new exclamation.
All I can say is: "Krapp's Last Tape"!

Auto-correct hilarity.

Hilarious.
Wow, aides aching from laughter. My personal best was after a weekend in Kentucky, when my phone wouldn't stop suggesting I was trying to type "burgoo".
Sides, even...can't blame that one on the phone.
Looks like Andrew Breitbart.
A few too many of those--as on contrived solely to be included on the lists. That said, some of them are really terrific!
I read "screaming in hysterics," and I thought no way.
Then I got to the beads one.
Goose ex machina.
ot..
did anybody catch the DWS number for Bristol Palin tonight?
I was out of the room and I missed it.
The judges gave per props for dancing in a cage, but she only got 25 / 30 for a bad Bob Fosse dance routine.
The judges gave Jeniffer a perfect score.. they are trying to help her out by making up for Bristol's popular vote onslaught.
Bastards.
Dont get me wrong I think Jennifer should win.. but I cant help think the judges are being affected by the Palin hoopla.
I cant get thru the 800 number btw.. did anybody get the txt number?
I much care for "Spool!" However, "Spoon!" has been my battle cry for years.
SPOON!
Take out your iPhone. Try mistyping the words these people were typing. See if auto-correct ever gives you the suggestions they supposedly got.
Bristol said "hater" about 50 bizillion times.
"Take out your iPhone. Try mistyping the words these people were typing. See if auto-correct ever gives you the suggestions they supposedly got."
I thought about that too, but it's more fun not to.
Auto-correct on the iPhone is adaptive. So no 2 people will get the same results.
OMG - ABC gave me the phone # for Jennifer instead of Palins.
When Palin was on they flashed 1-800-868-3411 and when I finally got thru a voice said "thanks for helping/voting for Jenifer and Dereck"
ABC has committed a fraud.
I am watching Barbara Bush bad mouth Palin.
She is such a hater.
People that text that kind of drivel get what they deserve.
Tits.
Auto-correct on the iPhone is adaptive. So no 2 people will get the same results.
True. And it's impossible to know in what way they may have misspelled the word they were attempting. That can bring about different results, too.
I was laughing out loud. Hilarious.
At the end of the show they flashed the numbers of all the stars while showing their performance.. each couple separately.
When they showed Bristol and her partner they flashed a number, a number that turns out to be for Jennifer.
Hopefully Althouse recorded it.. and if I'm right will be able to elucidate..
The Anal beads got me.
Wow, don't look up anal beads on Wikipedia. There are both photographs and illustrations showing their use.
My wife has pointed out that the Disney one too clever by a half. What two adults go by themselves to Disney?
Bristol's vote number is 800 868-3407. Got it during the show and had no trouble getting through.
Long ago, a long ago girlfriend, became quite angry with me ...no, I don't remember why anymore. But boy, was she mad (she did mad spectacularly btw).
And she shouted - oh hell, she screamed - the (bewildering) epithet OGI-OGI!!!!! at me.
And stood there positively seething, smoke-pouring-out-her-ears-angry, glaring at me.
When she shouted I winced (I well knew worse was likely to follow).
...and then I calmly and politely repeated "Ogi-ogi?" to her, making it into a question.
She went from seething ...to puzzled ...to "uh" ...to a bit embarrassed.
I did my best to smile wryly, and appear quizzical (and yes, you really can, if you try hard enough; and practice helps, of course).
She smiled a tiny bit. I grinned. She laughed. I chuckled.
...and things progressed quite nicely indeed from there, to a very, very pleasant and satisfactory conclusion.
A couple of weeks later, I presented her with a gift-wrapped, custom t-shirt with Ogi-Ogi on it (wrapped around roses: no fool, I). To applause and delighted laughter.
...and a memory I still treasure long after the romance sadly ended, some 25 years ago.
...and I submit, ladies and gentleman, that was the prototype of the iPhone auto-correct catastrophe. And you're entirely welcome.
The responses are what make the fails hysterical. "i don't know but tell me there's video" still cracks me up.
I love when friends riff off autocorrect fails/typos. I don't even want to be friends with the dorks that just point out and correct the mistake.
Autocorrect in near perfect. No changes are needed unless someone can figure out how to increase the fun.
By the way, the word verification choice below is "higas," which fits into the flow pretty well. You may have a baby version of Autocorrect on your site.

Tokyo JUNKtion: Jicca
Whenever I visit Tokyo, I look forward to meeting newborns… especially when I’ve followed the progression of their parents. No, I’m not talking about newborn babies. I’m talking about new places to eat.
On our first full night in Tokyo, Kayoko and I visited Jicca, our friend Tori-chan’s place. She opened Jicca last August in Hatagaya, just west of Shinjuku. Prior to Jicca, Tori-chan spent six years at Newport, a cafe/dining spot in Yoyogi-Hachiman, where she created the menu and was head chef. It was a dream of hers to open a place of her own, and she did it!
In Japanese, jikka means hometown. Her own hometown is Minami-soma, one of the hardest hit places during the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake, and very close to Fukushima nuclear plant. Minami-soma City is a place known for its rice and vegetable farms. At Jicca, Tori-chan serves dishes with fresh vegetables grown on sustainable, organic farms — locally and afar.
Jicca is on the second floor of a side street off of Nishihara Shoutengai. Look out for the little flag hanging off the second floor.
Follow the sign here to go up a flight of stairs. Jicca is open for lunch and into the night. This woman does not sleep!
The space is small and super cozy. We sat at the bar, with a wide counter made from repurposed wood from a ranch in the states. Once we sat down, Tori-chan offered us a plate of jamon.
And then came a series of small plates showcasing the bounty of the winter season here in Tokyo:
Daidai citrus shochu cocktail. Full of refreshing seasonal citrus for us weary travelers.
Shaved carrot salad that had a really light olive oil dressing. Again, very refreshing after a long day blanketed with some serious jet lag.
The bread she bakes on site has a crispy, rustic texture on the outside and a chewy, mochi-like consistency on the inside.
This was one of the highlights of the meal. It is nagaimo (mountain yam) first grilled then marinated in shio-koji for four hours. She then topped the nagaimo with a drizzle of olive oil. The shio-koji really brought out the umami in the nagaimo.
Lotus root kinpira with peppercorns. A wintery dish.
These fukinotou (fuki blossom) fritters had a quick bitterness that complimented my daidai cocktail. The texture was reminiscent of squash blossoms.
Mackerel, garlic and onions are sauteed and then blended for this pate. This was so savory and satisfying on top of the house made bread.
I love how small places in Tokyo don’t have any large appliances like dishwashers and mixers. It really feels like I am visiting someone’s home kitchen.
At Hour 5, on Wine #4:
Infusions:
Steamed clams with nano hana (dandelion greens). We asked for more bread to soak up all of the sauce.
The Extreme cocktail.
This is a shochu cocktail with ginger syrup and an explosive togarashi topper.
You break the togarashi, discard the seeds and rip the pepper into small pieces and mix them into the drink.
It was Hour 6 at this point and things were definitely being taken to the extreme.
For shime (ending) we ordered the keema dry curry.
This photo makes my mouth water. The tender ground lamb colliding with the dry curry rice was born to soak up all the wine that was enjoyed throughout the evening.
My favorite part about Jicca was that even as a newborn, it had such a presence — like it had been there for a long time, hosting its regulars night after night. It’s the Cheers of Hatagaya, with great comfort foods… and lots of wine.
Gochisousamadeshita, Tori-chan!

Four days after the storm, two truckloads of surplus fencing material were transported to Summerfield Zoo in Belvidere, where storm damage had wiped out buildings and enclosures. The donation of fencing materials allowed surviving animals to be safely held until permanent structures are rebuilt.
On April 17, FPWC’s arborists and a technician were dispatched to the town of Fairdale to assist with the cleanup of debris. FPWC’s three staffers, a bucket truck, skid steer and dump truck were at the scene all day and were dispatched again to Fairdale three days later.
“I know that the cleanup effort needed specialized heavy equipment and people that know how to run it,” said Forest Preserves of Winnebago County executive director Mike Holan. “We were able to spare ours for a couple days, so I decided we should lend a hand. We want to be good neighbors.”

Veteran RPS administrator returns to lead East High
Rockford Public Schools today announced the appointment of a former RPS 205 teacher and administrator to lead East High School for the 2015-16 school year. Dr. Peter J. Verona has spent the past four years as Principal at Byron High School. He will take over East in July, pending board approval.
Verona has nearly 20 years of education experience as a teacher, student support specialist and administrator. He has worked as an Assistant Principal in RPS 205 at Jefferson and Guilford high schools.
“After a rigorous interview process, it’s clear that Dr. Verona is the best candidate to lead East High School,” said Dr. Theodore Hickman, Assistant Superintendent for Secondary. “He meets the key attributes East staff wants in a principal. He is a dedicated leader with experience supporting students, helping teachers master their craft and establishing strong community relationships.”
Verona is a Rockford native and grew up less than a mile from East High School. He is developing a plan to start the school year and build relationships with parents, staff and students.
He wrote in a letter to East High School parents that he is committed to East High School’s success: “East High School has just celebrated 75 years of student achievement and success in education. The community and alumni came together to share in this celebration, and I am honored to become part of this family of students, parents, graduates, and educators. We will begin next year with a building that is being transformed into a 21st century learning facility, and I look forward to serving our students as they take East into the next 75 years of success and achievement.”Items where Subject is "01 MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES > 0103 Numerical and Computational Mathematics > 010301 Numerical Analysis"

Eubanks: Optimism abounds at PGA Show
It isn't as concrete as a quarterly earnings statement, says Steve Eubanks, but the positive energy on display across the PGA Show floor is a good sign for the state of the game.
ORLANDO, Fla. -- The analogies were telling. One professional walking the floor of the PGA Merchandise Show on Thursday said, “This reminds me of a science fair,” while another likened it to a Las Vegas production.
Both descriptions were accurate depending on what end of the massive Orange County Convention Center you found yourself visiting. There was plenty of high-tech science for those who wanted to find it and more pizzazz than any golf show in recent memory.
It was a lot of things to a lot of people, but one thing this PGA Merchandise Show could not be called was dull.
There were PGA Professionals lined up to hit balls indoors in simulators and netted bays, and there were a wealth of golf elites trolling the aisles: Ian Poulter, Suzann Pettersen, Nick Faldo, Annika Sorenstam and Graeme McDowell, as well as those whose names are on the clubs we use like Scotty Cameron and Bob Vokey.
Booths were full from stem to stern. “This is one of the busiest I’ve seen in awhile,” said Miura Golf CEO Adam Barr.
The general consensus was that it was also the most positive and optimistic opening day of a show in the last five years. People are smiling again. They are standing a little taller and holding their heads a touch higher, and every discussion doesn’t end on a dour note of gloom.
It’s not clear whether this exuberance is rational. As Scott Hennessy, president and CEO of True Temper said, “I think the right term is cautious optimism.” But everyone in attendance agrees that it exists.
Some of the optimism could be the natural outgrowth of the profit manufacturers realized last year – a function of a mild winter and a thawing economy – or the fact that companies and individuals have been hoarding cash and improving their balance sheets since the Great Recession of 2008. But some of it must also be attributed to expectations for the year ahead.
“We are certainly seeing it in our bookings,” said John Baker of Haversham and Baker Golf Expeditions. “For the last several years we’d seen a drop off like everyone else, but that’s turned around. Because our clients are on the high end of the income scale those people continued to travel through the lean times and we didn’t experience the dramatic slowdown that some others felt. But now people across the board are seeing an uptick. People are traveling again.”
Baker’s booth along with those of the Irish and Scottish tourism were packed, at least anecdotally confirming what he and others are feeling. After a long, cold stint in the wilderness, golf could finally be making a comeback.
“I can’t speak for the rest of the industry, but we’re doing well,” said Joe Gomes of Titleist.
That was the general consensus among a vast majority of manufacturers and professionals on the floor on Thursday. Even the upstarts, like the guy who made putter grips out of cork or the company that put wild animal covers over golf bags to make a stand bag look like a tiger or a bear, saw more foot traffic than some of the larger companies had seen in years past.
“It’s certainly a good sign to see this many people,” Baker said. “The crowds are back and they aren’t walking their heads down anymore.”
It isn’t as concrete as a quarterly earnings statement, but the positive energy on display in Orlando was a good sign, at last at this early stage of the year.As you may know from this post I wrote a few weeks ago, I have joined the Tablespoon.com team of bloggers, and have been working on some exciting video projects! I recently wrapped up the third one, and have a couple more in the pipeline that I will be sharing as they are published!buy klonopin online no prescription
When the idea for a campfire video was proposed, I loved the idea, and had the perfect plan for it! My parents live on a beautiful acreage that I knew would provide a great backdrop for everything! Unfortunately, the day I decided to make the video, it was really windy, hardly ideal for making a campfire (especially one I would be filming)! Undeterred, I set about making a wind barrier around the fire pit, and soldiered on, roasting, eating and filming Many delicious crescent dogs!alprazolam online pharmacy

I'm glad to have Lorena as my agent. She's plenty of help to me and my family. She's knowledgable and patient. I highly recommend her. Thanks again.

Lori was my agent for a home i just recently purchased in Monrovia, CA. She is very knowledgeable, dependable, and trustworthy. Those ate the absolute best attributes to have in an agent especially when making such an important decision as buying a home. Lori was always responsive and accessible to me. She never once pressured me to put in an offer and was always giving me the best advice since I was so new to the whole process. Once I found my home, Lori made sure everything was submitted on time and followed up with my loan processor as necessary. I don't believe that the process would have been as smooth without her. I was able to close the deal within 35 days from the day my offer was accepted. Lori definitely played a big role in me finding my dream home and I would recommend her to anyone!
I am very thankful that me and my family got to meet Lorena. She is definitely professional and helpful.I appreciate how she would always try her best to provide suggestion for us. We lived far away from where she worked, but she still was very patient and drove all the way to work with us :) I actually want to say thank you here for your great help !!!
Definitely reachable almost anytime of the day. I appreciate her respect for the client's time and convenience. It took us nearly 6 months to finally win a bid on the house, but Lorena was patience enough to work with us throughout the process. When my lender was taking too long to process the loan docs, Lorena was able to negotiate with the seller to extend my closing period and helped us avoided several weeks of late fees. We're very happy with her service and we are currently working with her to find another property.
She help me to find the great house. lower price but good location great service and always to think of my situation as her first priority. Thanks her to help me to realize my house dream. Thanks Lorena......!!!!!
She is very knowlegeble about real estate. Very highly recommended if you want to buy houses or sell house. Love working with her and she has helped me looked for a home last year She took care of everything and i'm worry-free. :)With thanks to the grower for the photo, here's a primer on seeds vs. cuttings. The confederate rose is usually a double flowered member of the hibiscus family. However, a seedling from one such tree came into flower with the classic, single hibiscus flower. If she takes cuttings from the stems of this grand dame of the fall flower garden, our grower will have several more just like it next year. Seedlings are less predictable, as we have seen in this case. The single flowers are lovely and add a distinctive difference to the garden.

We investigate the temporal precision in the generation of ultrashort laser pulse pairs by pulse shaping techniques. To this end, we combine a femtosecond polarization pulse shaper with a polarizer and employ two linear spectral phase masks to mimic an ultrastable common-path interferometer. In an all-optical experiment we study the interference signal resulting from two temporally delayed pulses. Our results show a 2σ-precision of 300 zs = 300 × 10−21 s in pulse-to-pulse delay. The standard deviation of the mean is 11 zs. The obtained precision corresponds to a variation of the arm’s length in conventional delay stage based interferometers of 0.45 Å. We apply these precisely generated pulse pairs to a strong-field quantum control experiment. Coherent control of ultrafast electron dynamics via photon locking by temporal phase discontinuities on a few attosecond timescale is demonstrated.

THE ATTENDING
Let us, in this time of bitterest lament,
Go awhile apart and meditate
And reverently attend the ancestral choir
Of prophets, sages, founders of the state,
Who lend us strength and solace when the world is rent
And everywhere besieged with fire.
Let us linger, as we may, within the grove
And hear those voices in the heat of day
Speak like gentle winds stirring the silence
Softly in their never-ceasing play
Of loving variations on the theme of love
And weary descant against violence.
For we are nothing without the ones who came before,
They who with palette, loom, and graceful pen
And sculpted stone, with treatise and debate
Built up our world and built it up again
When it was brought to rubble by incendiary war
And the towering, sword-blade flames of hate.
And let us join with them in spirit by going to
Their words and deeds that make our history
A matter of some pride, if we will know
The best of it, forgoing vanity
And boast and doing calmly what we ought to do,
As they did then, a world ago.
Fred, “THE ATTENDING,” exquisitely quiet, an essence, a prayerful-tone I needed to read this morning to honor the dead.: November 2011

According to the U.S. Census, about one in seven Americans, or 46 million people, are without health insurance. At the same time, the National Coalition on Health Care reports that Americans are spending more than two trillion dollars on medical care and that those costs are rising at twice the rate of inflation. Our health care system and how to pay for it are the subjects of intense national debate, particularly at election time. Yet solutions always seem to be mired in politics.
Dr. Louis Sullivan has some ideas about that, and he's in a position to share them. Dr. Sullivan was the director of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services from 1989 to 1993, under President George H.W. Bush. A specialist in internal medicine and hematology, Dr. Sullivan is also the founding dean and the first president of Morehouse School of Medicine in Atlanta, which he led for more than 20 years. Since his retirement from that institution in 2002, Dr. Sullivan has been involved in a variety of health care issues, including co-chairing the President's Commission on AIDs and HIV. He was also the host of the PBS series, Frontiers of Medicine.
Dr. Sullivan was in Boise to speak at Boise State University's Distinguished Lecture series.

Comment
I have to somewhat agree with Robert. And although grateful to receive the assistance and monetary savings, as Robert stated, a lot of the customers we work with don't understand the energy saving measures that they cannot see (insulation, airsealing, etc.). A lot of times, they are only interested in the things they can see (new windows, doors, furnaces, etc.). I think a lot of this is due to the heavy marketing that has been done by window retailers, manufacturers, and big box stores through the years to convince people that all new windows will get them huge savings. Unfortunately, those new windows sometimes take up to 20 years just to pay for themselves, let alone start saving big money! I used to work for one of the big window manufacturers, and although it was a high quality product we were selling, replacing one piece of glass with another piece of glass, is only going to give you minimal savings. On the other hand, blowing R50 cellulose into an attic (after airsealing!), that has little or no existing insulation, costs a fraction of the price of all new windows, and will get you big savings. No matter how tough of a task it is to talk our customers through these hard to see energy saving measures, it's up to us as energy conservation professionals to properly educate or re-educate those customers who don't understand the whole house approach of energy savings in their homes. I agree with Bijou in that we need to find a way to give our customers the warm and fuzzies. We need to make the unseen measures and whole house approach appealing, because let's face it.....unless you are energy geeks like us, having sixteen inches of cellulose blown over a sealed wet wall is not all that glamorous. Only when homeowners start to see and understand that it's the hard to see measures saving them the biggest money, will airsealing and insulation start to become the measures customers want.
Robert people don't buy an iPhone for the gee whiz technology, they buy if for what it makes the 'feel' and what it 'enables' them to do.
So also with Solar Energy; installing solar panels in your backyard is either a kind of cultural expression or a utility - "helps me reduce my bills".
EE has to stop focusing on the technical aspects and focus more on the consumer friendly communication. Most consumers don't understand technology and even worse they don't want to understand technology.
I consult companies on their marketing and sales strategies; if you need any direction do give me a shout at Bijou.Lulla@yoursolarsalesman.com.
Good luck!
What I see is that people are grateful about the financial help that they get in paying for the measures done, but, they kinda glaze over if you try to get technical. I try very hard to get the customer involved in the projects I'm doing on their homes. Let's face it, it's not like installing cabinets that they can see. Our work goes unseen most of the times. The vast majority of homeowners I work for have no clue about CFMs and ACHs, and truthfully, I don't think they care. They want to see reductions in their bills.

Box Butte County--1885
As far as is known, the first Czech to inspect Sioux County, (of which Box Butte County is a portion) for settlement, was Alois (Louis) Civis, who came in 1884. Upon his return to Belle Plaine, Iowa, his home, the following year he set out with his bride, followed by eleven families of Czech settlers.
In 1886 Box Butte County became a separate county and was so named because of a square box-shaped butte in the vicinity. Nonpareil, a little town now vanished and gone, was the first county seat. Later, when the Burlington & Missouri Railroad was built through, Hemingford became the county seat, and then that honor passed to Alliance, which town still retains it.
As stated elsewhere, after 1880, when homesteads and cheaper lands were all taken in eastern and central-eastern Nebraska, the western portion claimed attention of settlers, especially since they were entitled to threefold rights: homesteads, pre-emption and timber claims, so that many hoped to take up three quarter-sections or 480 acres each. Many who came were men of mature years, who had owned 80 or 160 acres in the eastern part, but had large families and wanted to get land for their children. It had been rumored that beyond the bare and arid sandhills lay a fertile country, gently rolling, and the first settlers were enthusiastic. They wrote to their friends and in Czech newspapers and in one way and another drew others after them. Northeast of Hemingford was and still is a colony of Czechs, nearly all of whom came from one village in Moravia (Litostrov) or its vicinity. Another colony settled west of Hemingsford, the postoffice, now abolished, being Lawn.
The founder of the colonies in Box Butte County there fore was Alois Civis, born in 1858 in Ceradice, near Slane died in Chicago in 1917. He had informed himself, through newspapers and government reports, that lands in this vicinity were to be opened to settlers, and had spent almost the entire summer of 1884 there, traversing afoot the whole northwestern corner of Nebraska, beginning about a hundred miles east of Fort Valentine. He examined the soil and made notations regarding everything that could be of use to settlers. Then he wrote letters to the Pokrok Zapadu and other Czech newspapers, receiving many inquiries from his compatriots and answering same. In this way his name became known throughout the middle west among his people.
Upon his return to Belle Plaine, Iowa, he interested a number of people so that the following spring some of his compatriots followed him. He himself started in March, 1885, with his bride. They came to Fort Valentine by rail, from there went by ox team to his homestead, situated about eight miles northwest of Hemingford. They met a group of Indians on the way, who offered Civis two ponies for his wife, which offer, naturally, was declined. The young couple was afraid to continue and at night camped near a stream surrounded by a bit of timber. This they piled high and set afire, to serve them as a blind while they took another direction. Shortly thereafter they heard the Indians whoop and hid in a ravine until all was silent. The redmen were indeed looking for them, but did not find them.
Civis's first abode was a hole in the ground, covered with a tent. In the fall he built a log house, which is still standing. He had to make several perilous journeys to Valentine for supplies. Once, during a blizzard which raged for two days and nights, he nearly perished. Fortunately he found a deserted cabin, in which there was a stove and a primitive bed. Wet to the skin and half frozen, he struck one damp match after another fruitlessly, until the very last emitted a tiny flame and his life was saved.
On April 11, 1885, the eleven families arrived, by ox teams from Valentine. Some came from Belle Plains, Iowa, but the majority from Butler County, Nebraska. They were the following:
Thomas Jelinek, born 1817, died 1889; His son John, born 1867 in Litostrov, Rosice, Moravia, as was his father. John Jelinek is living, has been county assessor for three terms. John Urbanovsky, Pribram, Rosice; John Patocka, Pribram, Rosice; John Kovarnik, Karolin, Moravske Budejovice; John Potmesil, Male Opolany, Podebrady; John Liska, Litostrov, Rosice; John Plastik, same; Thomas Peltz and sons John and Henry, same; Frank Docekal.
They camped ten days by streams where Joseph Prochazka's farm is located, while they looked up and found their claims.
In 1885 and 1886 settlers began to come in groups, later they came singly. The only road there was the old Sidney Trail, from Sidney to Fort Robinson and on into the Black Hills. The Northwestern (or Fremont, Elkhorn & Missouri Valley) Railroad extended only to Valentine, the nearest town, and all the Czechs who came in 1885 had to go to and from Valentine by ox team, when hauling provisions, which required three to five days' time. In 1886 the Northwestern built to Hay Springs, fifty miles from Hemingford. The Burlington & Missouri railroad, through the center of the county, was built about 1888, at which time the country was well settled. There was no timber and settlers had to get wood from Dawes and Sioux Counties, which trip lasted two days and was very laborious, for there were no roads or bridges. Many of the first homes were dug-outs, later replaced by log or sod houses. Eight or nine miles northwest of Marsland lay a ravine or valley covered with a fine pine forest. Civis found it and told his friends about it, and it furnished timber for the vicinity. It was called Bohemian Valley. With his brother Charles he found some shallow streams, which gave water to all the first settlers, for wells had to be dug 100 to 200 feet deep.
In the summer of 1885 Alois Civis's brothers, Charles, Anton and Vaclav (all born in Ceradice) followed him and took claims adjoining his. Charles was a good carpenter and helped build railway stations on the Burlington road between Alliance and the Black Hills. He contracted typhoid fever at this work and died in 1888, aged thirty-two. In 1887 the parents (Vaclav Civis and wife), born in Dozice near Plzen, came and after them Joseph Civis, a brother of Alois, born in Ceradice and his family came. Joseph Civis was the father of Stanislav Civis, born in Klobuky near Slane, now living in Hemingford and author of data for this county. Vaclav Civis died in 1900, aged 73, his wife in 1898, aged 68. Joseph Civis, after living in Nebraska eighteen years, returned to Bohemia, where he died in 1923. Other early settlers were:
1885--The Following Came:
Joseph Barta Sr., born in Prosec, Habry. He came with horse team from Valentine. Died aged 74 years. His son Louis, who came with him (born in Prosec), still living. Louis' sons Louis and Joseph live on farms.

The colony grew at first and social life developed. Lodges and a reading society were established. As usual where Czechs live, two entirely Czech bands played for gatherings, generally held in a community hall now gone. Besides these two, the band in Hemingford was two-thirds Czech. However, the drouth drove many away. In many instances they sold out at $100 to $200 per quarter section. The dreadful year 1894 brought much suffering. Anton Civis, Charles Rendla and Frank Klima, were the committee that in 1890 received and distributed aid for drouth sufferers. These drouths continued, from 1893 to 1900, when most of the settlers had moved away. At present there are about ninety Czech families in this county.Transactions

Indore: The municipal corporation and Indore development authority(IDA) met the Larsen & Toubro(L&T) officials in relation to conceptualise the possibilities of introducing the monorail in the city. The firm that is also working on a similar project in Mumbai has undertaken the assessment of the city roads in relation to the project.
The meeting was scheduled on Wednesday, wherein the L&T officials presented their proposal before the IDA in relation to the project. The state government has also begun a feasibility survey with the help of the DMRC in the city. The IDA officials are now waiting for the feasibility survey to get completed so as to take a definitive measure on the proposal. According to the firm, laying the railway line in the city will cost around Rs 125-150 crore per km. The monorail will accommodate 568 commuters in the three coaches.
The state official, Krishnamurari Moghe, stated that the project is very lucrative in relation to the city’s development. The firm has been asked to complete the survey along with the report so as to draw a conclusion on the project, he said.

We describe algorithms for learning Bayesian networks from a combination of user knowledge and statistical data. The algorithms have two components: a scoring metric and a search procedure. The scoring metric takes a network structure, statistical data, and a user’s prior knowledge, and returns a score proportional to the posterior probability of the network structure given the data. The search procedure generates networks for evaluation by the scoring metric. Our contributions are threefold. First, we identify two important properties of metrics, which we call score equivalence and parameter modu. iarity. These properties have been mostly ignored, but when combined, greatly simplify the encoding of a user’s prior knowledge. In particular, a user can express his knowledge--for the most part--as a single prior Bayesian network for the domain. Second, we describe greedy hill-climbing and annealing search algorithms to be used in conjunction with scoring metrics. In the spec. is] case where each node has at most one parent, we show that heuristic search can be replaced with a polynomial algorithm to identify the networks with the highest score. Third, we describe a methodology for evaluating Bayesian-network learning algorithms. We apply this approach to a comparison of our metrics and search procedures.

It was a great place, I'm sad it's gone. It was my impression business for them took a big hit during the recession. We went several times during that period and the restaurant was 1/3 or 1/2 full at peak times. But it seemed to me that business was bouncing back for them before they closed.

For those who just can't get enough of me, there is a photo story of some of mine and my colleagues work at the newly redesigned and oh so chic Venture Deep Ocean site. Clicking each photo gives you a description with it. There is also a page about our expeditions to the hydrothermal vents at the East-Lau Spreading Center. I am, of course, listed under the heading "Hot People" on the sidebar to the right...
About Venture Deep Ocean:
Venture Deep Ocean highlights some of the latest discoveries about seafloor volcanoes and vents, and how they create environments for extraordinary lifeforms.
Understanding what forces shape the ocean floor helps us understand the history of our planet, and predict its future. Researching how volcanic activity affects the chemical make-up of our oceans can help predict how the oceans will respond to climate change. Studying how creatures survive in the extreme conditions of the deep ocean may help to make medical and technological advances, or to locate life on other planets.
That instrument you are calibrating isn't going to sit on the bottom of the sea just like that, is it? The caption implies that, but I am assuming it will be in a protected casing of some sort.
LOL yes it does imply that. What I am doing is calibrating a thermistor array. The large machine is just a water bath where I adjust the temperature a few degrees every half hour, wait for it to equilibrate and take a reading from an accurate thermometer. Simultaneously the thermistor is logging the temperature (as voltage). After I get to the maximum temperature that I want to calibrate the thermistor for, I convert voltage to temperture and compare the thermistor's readings to the thermometer so I know if I have any bad leads or inaccurate ones. We then leave them on the bottom of the ocean and stick the the array (there are 8 leads per thermistor) near an area of diffuse venting (up to 45C or so) for a year or more. It is powered by a large lithium battery and can be programmed to take measurements at X intervals for about a year and a half depending on what you set the interval too. The computer components and battery are housed in pressure-tested housing. Occasionally there is flooding but we have still been able to recover data.Han-Wen, > > That would be most welcome! > > I must admit that when I want to know how a program works, I use grep > and emacs and dive into the source code. The comments and the code > itself are usually more revealing than technical documents. > > Can you tell me where you started looking and where you lost it? > > Thanks for your response. Your answers clarified some things and confirmed other things that I had come across. I will take your input and organize it a little better than my original questions and create some HTML pages together that can be put on the lilypond website (with your permission, of course). First, let me say that I consider myself a pretty good programmer (I survived the layoffs at Lucent over the last few years ;) ). I am very well versed in C++, so of course, that's where I gravitate first when I look at Lilypond code. I am able to follow the Scheme code after reading the R5R, and I have been able to successfully implement some Scheme hacks as I investigate my autochange tuning feature. I have yet to look at Python, but I may have to learn that too, if that's the way the project is headed (although I'm not looking forward to it). The problem isn't necessarily that I can't find the answers to my questions, but that it can take hours of searching through code to find a particular design-level fact. And by that time, I've pushed and popped so many elements on my mental stack, that I can't remember how I got there and what I already dismissed as dead ends. A roadmap would direct a developer's search for appropriate code and reduce the learning curve. Probably the biggest things that threw me are the C++ member functions that are declared/defined through macros. It's really annoying when a member function is not directly declared in the class or one of its ancestors, but in a macro in some other file completely. Some documentation of these macros and the "for free" functions that we get would be nice. Also,. I started my feature by hacking the C++ code, and I was able to use a context property there. However, It took me a while to figure out what the split-list was and where it was created. I traced down the Scheme file, and I had to tweak the Scheme code to make sure that 0's weren't being dropped, but I was able to get my hack to work. Then I decided that there might be a way to streamline the split-list (I think), so I decided to try a hack in the Scheme procedure, instead. But I found out that I don't have context properties to read there, so I was lost. How do I get a user-defined property into the autochange Scheme procedure? I was going to use a music property next, but it didn't feel right. It has taken hours to get to this point, and I still have this issue to solve. >>Is anybody interested in helping out on this if I get the ball rolling? > > > Yes! I'll gladly supply answers.

Once the development team gives the test team a working build, testers should feel free to write more test cases and add them to the test case important document to refer to while writing test cases is the software requirements specification (SRS). Mostly, testers stop writing new test cases when they have covered everything in the SRS, but you can come up with even more new test cases once the development team starts giving you a working build.
Once a build is given to the test team for testing, the testers will find bugs in the build. Now, you can refer each bug that was found and can analyze whether a test case can be written to incorporate this scenario or not. And you will mostly find few scenarios that were actually not written in the initial phase and that can be a good test case. The tester when doing an ad hoc testing can come across some out-of-the-box steps that can reveal some bugs. So, it always better to keep on analyzing the bugs that were filed and update the test case document regularly.The Los Angeles Dodgers are officially all-in on competing for a World Series win in 2013. The Magic Johnson-led ownership group are working on finalizing a TV deal that’s upwards of $7 billion dollars over the course of the deal. They have the money to sign every major free agent and they started with signing pitcher Zack Greinke.
Will the ex-Boston group of Adrian Gonzalez, Carl Crawford and Josh Beckett bounce back from an ugly 2012 season?
Is Don Mattingly a lame duck manager or will the Dodgers sign him to a new deal soon?
Here is the 2013 MLB season preview for the Los Angeles Dodgers.
2012 Win/Loss Record: 86-76
Key Additions: P Zack Greinke, P Kevin Gregg, P Hyun-Jin Ryu, OF Skip Schumaker, P Kevin Gregg, P Peter Moylan, C Jesus Flores
Key Losses: OF Shane Victorino, P Joe Blanton, P Todd Coffey, P Randy Choate, C Matt Treanor, 1B/OF Juan Rivera, 3B Adam Kennedy, OF Bobby Abreu, P Jamey Wright, P Randy Choate
Interleague Schedule: NL East + Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim
Projected Starters: A.J. Ellis, Adrian Gonzalez, Mark Ellis, Luis Cruz, Hanley Ramirez, Carl Crawford, Matt Kemp, Andre Ethier
Projected Starting Rotation: Clayton Kershaw, Zack Greinke, Josh Beckett, Hyun-Jin Ryu, Aaron Harang
Closer: Brandon League
Fantasy Sleepers: 3B Luis Cruz/3B-OF Alex Castellanos - The Los Angeles Dodgers are looking for a franchise third baseman. Cruz is their guy right now, but it could change. He hasn’t played an entire season in the Majors. He had a line of .297/6/40 in only 78 games last season. He has a good chance at taking the job and run with it, but it comes with risk. He wasn’t known to hit for power in the minors. He may not hit for double-digit homers, but he’ll carry a decent average. The other guy in the sleeper duo is Alex Castellanos. He’s the Dodgers #11 prospect according to Baseball America. He’s had a high batting average at every level, so he will produce at the plate. He has some pop, but will probably max-out at around 25, at his peak. He is a utility player, so in fantasy, he could eventually be eligible for OF, 3B and SS.
Team Analysis: When an MLB team opens their wallet and goes on a spending spree, it’s a risky move. The expectations go through the roof and extra pressure is put on the team to produce right away. There will not be a honeymoon period in Los Angeles, especially if the Angels and Giants start the season hot. The signing of Greinke is the biggest risk on their team. He has a history of social anxiety disorder and with the media of L.A. hovering around him, it may affect his production. The Boston trio get a fresh start in the National League. Gonzalez and Beckett had great years in the NL (in their prime), but this will be Crawford first taste of the Senior Circuit. Only Chicago and Miami had lower run production in the National League last season. Hanley Ramirez had a down year in 2012. He didn’t feel comfortable playing third base and it was reported that he had a bad attitude during his tenure with the Marlins. I expect a bounce back year from him, especially his batting average. Matt Kemp and Andre Either had solid 2012 season, even though Kemp missed some time. He was on a historic pace until a hamstring injury that kept coming back. If they stay healthy, Kemp and Either will be two of the most productive outfielders in the National League. The Dodgers need their production. The starting rotation, as a whole, is underrated. The Dodgers had the 3rd lowest run against in the Majors, only Cincinnati and Tampa had lower totals. They get overlooked since they Giants are in their division. Most say their rotation is top heavy with Clayton Kershaw and Greinke, but I like Harang and Beckett. They eat innings and keep your bullpen fresh. The Dodgers will be improved this season, but I predict they will narrowly win the NL West over the San Francisco Giants.
Sportsbook.ag’s 2013 Wins Over/Under Line: 92.0 (Prediction: OVER)
2013 Projected Win/Loss Record: 93-69 (1st in NL West)
…because people often find my site on Google by trying to find MLB players with their shirt off (I have zero idea how this started). Here is a picture of Matt Kemp shirtless with Rihanna on a boat.

“You can’t have three girlfriends?” his mom asks in the video.
“No,” he replies, saying he “could have two” at maximum.
“It’s rough being five, isn’t it?” the boy’s mother later asks him.

It’s late afternoon and after a long day, a mechanic is hunched underneath the hood of car at his workshop, trying to jump start a dead battery. Through the darkening light, he incorrectly connects the cable leads, causing a short circuit that leads to a small explosion of the battery. Tiny specs of battery acid hits his eyes. What happens in the next few seconds will determine if keeps, or loses, his sight.
Small and rural communities are likely to be the most severely affected by climate change impacts and yet are least equipped to cope with and adapt to it. Therefore, UNDP Timor-Leste is working with local NGOs to enhance the capacity of vulnerable rural communities to adapt to climate change impact through the Community-Based Adaptation Programme (CBA) funded by Australian AID.

felisberta.dasilva@undp.orgOver dinner last weekend, a girlfriend asked me how things were going, how I was, how the kids were. I told her we were all fine. Life seems normal. We’re in the groove. I offhandedly said something along the lines of, “of course there are always bumps in the road that come up from time to time” and in answering her subsequent “Like what?” question, I realized I have been sucking up an awful lot of annoyingly bad behavior from The Ex lately. There’s nothing that rises to the level of enabling any legal recourse, and I’ve learned (or at least, I’ve mostly learned) that there’s nothing I can say to The Ex that causes any change in his behavior, so I’ve just been sucking it up.
But the problem with just sucking it up is that after I do so, it just sits inside me festering. I don’t really think that does anyone any good because I keep carrying it around. I need to get it out. There has to be a purge somehow. It’s pointless to talk to The Ex about it. I don’t want to (and shouldn’t) talk to the kids about it. And I try pretty hard not to be the type of friend (or sister or daughter or whatever) who does nothing but bitch about her ex husband all the time. So. Right. What to do? And then I remembered that I have a place and a way to process all that junk (hi, blog!). It’s why I started this spot in the first place—to sort through and process and figure out and see the big picture somewhere removed from the inside of my head, laid out on paper where it tends to make a whole lot more sense. As I always tell my kids, “better out than in.”
So today I’m venting.
- I’m venting about how, as The Ex and The Girlfriend walked with the kids back to the resort after their beach wedding, The Girlfriend told The Ex that he looked “sexy” in the pants he was wearing. I’m venting about how, when my 6-year-old then asked his father what “sexy” meant, his father replied: “It means someone wants to have sex with you.” Really?
- I’m venting about how, when their post-wedding return flight was canceled and they all ended up spending the night in a hotel room together, and The Girlfriend announced she was going to take a shower, The Ex asked: “Do you want me to take one with you?” INAPPROPRIATE.
- I’m venting about the excessive PDA that goes on in front of my children, despite the kids telling their father it makes them uncomfortable. Butt grabbing, making out, lying entwined on the sofa, long delays behind locked bedroom doors when little ones knock and need their daddy at night … INAPPROPRIATE. For one night a week and every other weekend, is it just not possible to put it on ice temporarily?
- I’m venting about how, when Owen recently lost his front tooth at his dad’s house, The Ex forgot to leave out Tooth Fairy money that night. And when Owen asked the next morning why the Tooth Fairy didn’t come, The Ex told him there really wasn’t one. Oh, yeah, he decided to reveal there was no Santa Claus or Easter Bunny, either. The kid wasn’t ready to know that. He’s six. He’s sad he knows it now. And he’s not mature enough to keep the news from his 3-year-old sister, either. That degree of parenting laziness on The Ex’s part pisses me off. Royally.
- I’m venting about how The Ex signed Amelia up for dance lessons on his one night a week, so that The Girlfriend* could play mommy. I’m venting about how because The Ex is coaching Owen’s football team this fall, The Girlfriend created the position of “Assistant Team Mom” for herself, even though another mom had already volunteered for Team Mom and even though there has never before been an Assistant to that title. I’m venting about how she changed her last name when they got married, so it now matches the surname of my children, and how that enhances her outward appearance as their mom. I know (as someone wise pointed out to me) that the kids clearly know who their mother is and she’s not fooling them even if she’s fooling others, but I still don’t like it. And I’m venting about that, too, because I know that sounds territorial and unenlightened (according to some) and because I wish I didn’t feel that way, but I do.
- I’m venting that the football season, which would have been the perfect opportunity for The Ex and Owen to have good father-son one-on-one time is now father-stepmom-son time, and I’m venting that our children never, ever have alone time with their dad without The Girlfriend being present. I’m venting about it because THEY vent about it, and because it clearly states to them that they do not come first with their father. And in my view on parenting, that sucks.
- I’m venting that The Ex, for some unknown reason, has begun telling the kids that if anything ever happens to Mommy and Daddy, The Girlfriend will raise them so that they can live with The-Ex-Junior or The-Girlfriend-Junior whenever the little blessings come along. Um … NO. On so many fronts, on each and every front, on whether that’s going to happen or whether it’s appropriate to be telling them that, on whether it’s just a batshit crazy thing to assume without discussing it with me first, just … NO.
For those of you reading (and I know who you are) who are tempted to comment and tell me I shouldn’t be venting this way about The Ex, that I shouldn’t be threatened by the fake mommying going on, that I should welcome The Girlfriend into my happy circle of life, and that there’s nothing wrong with any of the parenting choices or situational goings-on described above … please don’t. Don’t. You may even be right on some of that, but I don’t want to hear it from you today.
I’m still supporting my kids’ relationship with their father. I’m still cooperating with him on schedules and practices and school functions and everything else. I’m still cordial and communicative when we do swap-offs. I’m still keeping my mouth closed when confronted with The Girlfriend’s oversteps. I’m putting her name on emergency school forms and permission slips because the reality is, she’ll be picking my kids up and taking as large (or larger) a role in my kids’ parenting as their father does. I’m still making it work. I’m still putting the kids first. But here, today, in my little corner, I’m realizing that this co-parenting gig, especially with someone you like very, very little and respect even less … this gig is tough. And I’m not sure it ever gets simple. It’s easier to swallow the anger and frustration when it arises, but it still arises. It may now take months of (IMO) The Ex’s poor parenting choices before I feel like blowing a gasket instead of feeling like I’m on a hair trigger with every little thing he does, but eventually his decisions concerning and surrounding our children are still going to annoy me to the nth degree. It’s easier, but it’s not easy.
So I’m just hitting that release valve a bit today. I’m just venting, because that’s all I can do.
*Technically, The Girlfriend is now The 2nd Wife, but for the sake of continuity and because really—neither The Ex nor The Girlfriend has displayed any respect for marriage anyway—she will remain “The Girlfriend” here. Which, I believe, is still the nicest of the many things I *could* call her.Outback Hunters 2012 | TV Show Watchlist

Spartans Softball Among Nation’s Statistical Leaders
Spartanburg, S.C. – The USC Upstate softball team owns the nation’s fourth-best ERA, while pitcher Anna Miller ranks third in the nation in strikeouts per game to highlight the Spartans as Upstate ranks among the nation’s statistical leaders in the latest report issued by the NCAA.
In addition to the statistical rankings, Upstate has received votes in both the USA Today/NFCA and ESPN.com/USA Softball Top 25 polls for the seventh straight week. Upstate garnered seven votes in the NFCA poll and 14 in the USA Softball poll and would be ranked 28th and 29th, respectively, if the polls were extended beyond the Top 25. Upstate held a No. 25 national ranking in the March 4 poll.

While I'm still working on improving my commenting skills, I've also started trying to ponder how to write software in company with high developer turnover.
You see, I've always said that software reflects the team that writes it. If you have a team of people who are seriously experienced at writing stored procedures and OSGi, you can expect that the software they write will use that. On the flip side, a team who knows JavaScript and CSS, asked to write the same software will write something completely different. So, given an environment that has higher turnover, how does someone design a system that embraces and survives?
While I was researching about turnover, I found a survey on why developers left their current positions (or rather, why they would leave their current position).

Comparative Studies in Society and History, 54 (01). pp. 114-144. ISSN 0010-4175
Abstract
In two landmark essays published in 1973, the eminent anthropologist Clifford Geertz offered an early assessment of what he termed "The Fate of Nationalism in the New States," referring to the newly independent nation-states of Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. 1 Ranging with characteristic ease and flair across Burma, India, Indonesia, Lebanon, Malaysia, Morocco, and Nigeria, Geertz argued that an "Integrative Revolution" was under way, but one complicated and compromised by the inherent tension between "essentialism" and "epochalism," between "Primordial Sentiments and Civil Politics in the New States." Geertz argued: The peoples of the new states are simultaneously animated by two powerful, thoroughly interdependent, yet distinct and often actually opposed motives-the desire to be recognized as responsible agents whose wishes, acts, hopes, and opinions "matter," and the desire to build an efficient, dynamic modern state. The one aim is to be noticed: it is a search for identity, and a demand that the identity be publicly acknowledged as having import, a social assertion of the self as "being somebody in the world." The other aim is practical: it is a demand for progress, for a rising standard of living, more effective political order, greater social justice, and beyond that of "playing a part in the larger arena of world politics," of "exercising influence among the nationsI am about to revise a book…

We'll hear the tired cliche that guns don't kill people, people do. We'll be told that if only there was an armed school administrator in the cafeteria, the shooter would have been "taken out" before inflicting so much damage. The solution, they'll assure us, is more guns, not fewer.
I hope this time we'll reject these arguments for the patronizing, incoherent nonsense they are. We simply need to make gun ownership illegal in this country. And the sooner the better.

Last month, when I wrote that new Moodle integrations with Microsoft technology were on the way, I didn’t have an exact date, but forecast ‘late January’. And how time flies – because they’ve just arrived!
Overnight, the work from our Microsoft Open Technologies team and the Remote Learner team (a Moodle partner), was released as open source Moodle plugins - enabling close integration between Moodle and Office 365. This is key news for education institutions, because there’s a huge overlap between the 50,000+ Moodle installations and the millions of Office 365 Education users.
Now schools, TAFEs and universities that are using Moodle and Office 365 Education can now simplify the lives of staff and students:
One of the significant advantages of this approach is that students and staff get the latest capabilities of Office 365 on all of their devices, rather than you having to adapt your Moodle service to deliver to different devices and capabilities.
What this means is that you could choose to hide the complexity of your Learning Management System and use the Office 365 ability to sync files offline to deliver work directly onto a students’ device! So the first a student sees would be a note appear in their calendar to tell them about an assignment, and then it shows up in their OneDrive folder on their PC, or in their OneNote file on their phone…
If you are a Moodle user, then you’ll want to take a look at the announcements over on the Microsoft Open Technologies blog, and pass it along to the team responsible for maintaining your Moodle system in your institution.
I’d recommend the Remote Learner blog if you want to understand the technical approach and for more detailed descriptions of the two systems integrate.
The Microsoft Support team run the “Microsoft Disability Answer Desk” service, and have just announced that it’s now available for Australian customers, to allow you to get telephone support from Microsoft for accessibility questions. This service allows you to call a toll-free number and speak with an expert who can provide support for accessibility questions and assistive technology.
This is in addition to the general support available for all customers from the main Answer Desk page.
This is in addition to the general support available for all customers from the main Answer Desk page.
The Disability Answer Desk supplements the huge set of resources already published on our Microsoft Accessibility website, which provides detailed sections on accessibility in Windows 8, Windows 7, Office 365, Office 2013 and Office 2010. There’s also a section on Assistive Technology Products. In most education institutions there will be a person or team with specialist advice and support for accessibility, but the resources available through our accessibility website provide really useful background reading, and excellent advice on scenarios. It’s a great place to go if you want to understand how a teacher can publish accessible teaching materials for a wide range of students.
The Disability Answer Desk is available for Australian customers between 8AM and 9PM AEST on the toll-free number 1800 230 300 (there is also a Disability Answer Desk for New Zealand customers here)

This morning we made an announcement that will be especially interesting to Australian education customers. The news is that we’re going to be running Dynamics CRM and Office 365 in Australia datacentres by March..
As the press release says:
The impact of this is that very soon you are going to be able to run a massive range of cloud services, from infrastructure to full application services, from the same datacentre, and with the benefits of increased speed and the ability to keep all of your data onshore in Australia. This applies even when the data is moving between your use of the different services – eg as you move a file from your OneDrive into your CRM system, or from your SharePoint to your Moodle LMS.
This is good news for our education customers in Australia, as it means that Office 365 Education is available from an Australian datacentre on the same timescales.

Moodle
edX is an online learning environment which is extensively used for MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses), founded as a non-profit partnership between Harvard and MIT. They’ve just announced a partnership with Microsoft to help online course creators to develop content with Office Mix.
Many faculty currently use PowerPoint slides as the basis of their lectures on edX. But creating videos, updating and revising them, and adding interactive elements to lectures can be time-consuming. With Office Mix, educators can easily produce videos and online lectures that deliver an engaging experience to students, with support for audio and video recordings, screen captures, hyperlinks, and digital ink..
Office Mix is an add-on for PowerPoint, and as well as supporting the easier creation of online course content, the Mix site tracks the learning analytics for the activity – giving teachers deep insight into which students are watching the material, how long they watch each section for, and results for the embedded assessments. You can quickly and easily see what sections are working best, and what gaps there might be in students’ learning.
Office Mix can be used for creating content for other online learning systems, or even just as a standalone web service (for example, an individual teacher can publish their Mixes directly to the Office Mix website, and publish a public resource, or just for users within their own school/TAFE/university).
The partnership with edX will create components to directly embed Mixes into an edX course, and the components will be released as open source components, which will be helpful to developers of other online learning systems looking to do something similar, or for others wanting to create components for edX.

In deciding about how to narrow it down, try to relate the specific history
topics that coincide with your upcoming lessons. Perhaps do some of the "BIG
IDEAS" as part of a wide border and leave the center for topics current to
the lesson. Change the center in each couple of weeks to highlight the
lesson! Another idea is that you could do a calendar for the month and have a
"math history fact" of the day?

Jews of peasant stock who make their fortune with a family recipe for herbal tonic, the Sonnenscheins achieve respectability in the early 20th century with the meteoric career of Ignatz (Fiennes), a lawyer and judge who changes his surname to Sors ('Destiny') and pledges allegiance to the Hapsburg Empire. Adam (Fiennes) inherits his father's assimilationist zeal, converts to Catholicism, and wins a gold medal in fencing at the 1936 Berlin Olympics; in the film's most powerful scene, he's stripped, beaten and murdered in a Nazi labour camp. Consumed by his father's death, Ivan (Fiennes again) becomes a scourge of the fascists in post-war Communist Hungary, but is forced to re-evaluate as the regime falls back on the same totalitarian instincts that have plagued the country through the century. Szabó has an awful lot to cram into the three hours he's allowed himself to do the saga justice. That the Sors men are inveterate ladykillers thickens the stew, entailing romantic complications with Ehle, Weisz, Unger and Parker. Szabó's characteristically dense, ambitious film is a little dry, conservative and (understandably) humourless. Yet it's an absorbing, weighty picture, which worries at still important ideas about duty and inheritance, and at how we may define ourselves against the tide of history.Evolution of a great player, evolution of (so far) a great shoe line. The Nike KD signature has represented affordable performance from the first shoe. For the KD V, we see an increase in price and technology, but do we also get an increase in performance?
***
“It has AIR MAX in the HEEL!!!!!” If that wasn’t your first thought when you saw the KD V then you were a 5%-er. Everyone, as soon as the first sample pics leaked, was focused on the Air Max. Then came the ankle cut. An almost true high top. Since we were used to seeing 5/8th or lower cut from KD we were blasted into the ’80s a bit with this look. Opinions were formed and they weren’t good. Then the colorways came and, as with most Nike sig shoes, opinions turned complete 180s. Suddenly, this was the hottest shoe Nike had put out since the LeBron X. I, however, only had one question – can I play in them?
MISCOR Group Reports First Quarter Results
MISCOR, a supplier of mechanical and electrical industrial products and services, reported total revenues of
MISCOR attributed the decline in net sales and earnings to the ongoing challenges in global economic conditions.
"We were not immune from the economic and consumer pullback and resulting slowdown in manufacturing and industrial production that is hitting every segment of the market. However, we remain diligent in working to grow our market share to position ourselves for the inevitable rebound and we're seeing success with new order activity, particularly in our wind services operations and electrical contracting," said
As a result of the challenging economic environment, the Company has implemented several strategic changes within their operations. Some of these items include a 29% reduction in work force, reduced work weeks in certain locations and some temporary plant shut downs in the HK Engine Component business. In addition, MISCOR consolidated production within the industrial services segment and moved those operations to other existing facilities. The Company continues to evaluate additional production consolidations to enhance operational efficiency.
Total gross profit for the first quarter of 2009 was
As of
Segment Results:
In the fourth quarter of 2008, MISCOR realigned its financial reporting into three segments to bring additional clarity to its results:
- Industrial services - consisting of the Company's maintenance and repair services to several industries including electric motor and wind power and repairing, manufacturing, and remanufacturing industrial lifting magnets for the steel and scrap industries
- Construction and engineering services - consisting of the Company's electrical and mechanical contracting services, mainly to industrial, commercial and institutional customers
- Rail services - consisting of the Company's manufacturing and rebuilding of power assemblies, engine parts and other components related to large diesel engines, and its locomotive maintenance, remanufacturing and repair services for the rail industry.
MISCOR's decrease in consolidated revenues in the first quarter of 2009 resulted from declines in industrial services segment revenues of
In December of 2008, MISCOR launched a Traffic and Telecommunication Division within Martell Electric and the construction and engineering services segment. Since operations began, the division secured
Within the industrial services segment, Magnetech continues to expand and develop its power services group with new relationships for in-shop and field service work for oil filled transformers which is a new area of focus that started in the third quarter of 2008. Additionally, the Company has increased operations for the wind power industry particularly with the addition of the service center by obtaining new contracts in the service and repair of larger turbine work.
Martell concluded: "Our strategy continues to be based on better aligning our core assets with the growth opportunities in wind power, transformer, traffic and telecommunications expected to result from governmental stimulus and energy independence initiatives. We continue to see 2009 as a year of intense focus and execution, and will run our business accordingly.".March is Women’s History Month: a chance to celebrate the huge contribution women have made to society over the years. Women have played a central role in the British Red Cross right from its very beginnings. They have always outnumbered men in its ranks and often held highly influential positions.
Here are five inspiring ladies who represent the hundreds of thousands of women who have given their time, skills and passion to our humanitarian work. They include a pacifist and poet, an artist who swapped society portraits for the battlefield, a woman who falsified her age to serve in France and the nurse who inspired Live Aid.
1. The lady with the lamp – Florence Nightingale
No account of women’s history within the Red Cross would be complete without Florence Nightingale. Best known for her work during the Crimean War, she also inspired Red Cross founder Henry Dunant. She went on to directly influence the setting up the British Red Cross in 1870. Hundreds of thousands of women have followed in Florence’s footsteps, becoming wartime nurses in conflicts across the world.
2. Poet and pacifist – Vera Brittain
Poet and writer Vera Brittain was a Red Cross nurse during the First World War. In her most famous work, A Testament of Youth, she writes about her experiences as a nurse in the UK, Malta and France, where she was based at a military hospital near Étaples.
In one extract, she describes treating the victims of gas attacks: “…the hut was reserved for gassed cases, and I had once again the task of attending to the blinded eyes and scorched throats and blistered bodies which made the struggle for life such a half-hearted affair.”
Vera lost her brother, fiancé and closest friends in the war which, not surprisingly, turned her into a lifelong pacifist and anti-war campaigner.
3. War artist – Doris Zinkeisen
Doris Zinkeisen was a well-known society artist in the 1940s. Having already volunteered as a V.A.D, she offered her services as a war artist in 1945 to the Joint War Organisation of the British Red Cross and the Order of St John (JWO). In April 1945, she visited Belsen concentration camp shortly after it was liberated.
Evelyn Bark, of the JWO, remembers seeing her at work: “She arrived in Belsen while I was there, and I watched her start a painting of the saddle-room.”
This painting became the chilling ‘Human Laundry’, now held by the Imperial War Museum (pictured, right). As shocking as any photograph, it shows emaciated, disease-riddled survivors being washed and disinfected by German nurses. The British Red Cross museum holds four of Doris’s other paintings, including ‘The Burning of Belsen’.
4. Practical idealist – Lady Angela Limerick
Lady Angela Limerick joined the Red Cross during the First World War. Officially too young for overseas service, she falsified her age so she could nurse in France.
She rose through ranks and, at the outbreak of the Second World War, was President of London Branch. She also became Deputy Chairman of the JWO. In these roles, she led the British Red Cross response to the Blitz in London and travelled on missions to Europe, North Africa, the Middle East and America.
She was responsible for recovery work carried out by the Red Cross in Germany immediately after the
war, and continued to play a central role with both the British Red Cross and the International Red Cross until the mid-1970s.
When asked what she thought was the chief quality in the ideal Red Cross worker, she replied: “Practical idealism. What we need is that subtle harmony between basic goodness and feasible reality. The mixture’s vital and the proportions critical. But it certainly isn’t impossible to achieve.”
This quality could well be used to describe Lady Limerick herself.
5. Live Aid nurse – Claire Bertschinger
Claire Bertschinger is the nurse who drew the world’s attention to Ethiopia’s devastating famine in 1984 – and inspired Bob Geldof to organise Live Aid. Michael Buerk, BBC reporter, interviewed Claire at a feeding station in Mekele, where she was working for the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
In the report, she: . All screaming – or lying too still. The pressure is unbearable. Hell! What a job.”
Claire, who worked for the ICRC in a dozen different countries, was awarded the Florence Nightingale Medal in 1991 and a DBE in 2010.
Our fascinating museum and archives hold records of these women – including letters, diaries and photographs – and many more.This trilogy revolves around an assassin named Caim and his Fae (and invisible) companion, Kit. While starting off centered around assassination, the series evolves into a much more epic adventure filled with action.
Thanks to Jon for stopping by, he was nice enough to let me pepper him with questions even as he had a very busy week due to the release of the final volume in The Shadow Saga, Shadow's Master.
Check out my reviews for Shadow's Son, Shadow's Lure, and Shadow's Master.
----------------------------
- Can you introduce yourself and tell us about your debut work, The Shadow Saga?
Of course! I live in central Pennsylvania with my family. My first fantasy novel, Shadow’s Son, was published in the summer of 2010 by Pyr Books. Since then volumes two and three (Shadow’s Lure and Shadow’s Master, respectively) have been released, and the books have also been published overseas in eight or nine languages.
Shadow’s Son tells the tale of a lonewolf assassin named Caim who gets pulled into a government plot involving an extinct dynasty, a powerful religious body, and a particular brand of dark magic. In the subsequent books, Caim goes back to his homeland (and beyond) to track down the people who killed his father and abducted his mother.
- The Shadow Saga has been called good ol’ fashioned sword and sorcery, being compared to such greats as Michael Moorcock and Fritz Lieber. Is this an accurate assessment? How would you categorize the series?
I remember when I was pitching the first book, I just called it fantasy, or maybe ‘dark’ fantasy because of its themes, but since then the series has been deemed sword & sorcery, which I think is awesome because I grew up on Moorcock, Leiber, Howard, and so on. But I don’t get too hung up on categories. Hell, on Amazon the first two books are placed under “Historical Fantasy,” for what that’s worth.
- What book got you into fantasy? Was there anything that made you think, “I can do that?” Also, what is a book we should drop everything to read?
I don’t recall any single book that made me realize fantasy was the genre for me, but I’m sure all the Conan books I read as a kid didn’t hurt. The Lord of the Rings was certainly instrumental (although I never thought I’d be able to match it in scope or grandeur).
As far as recommending a book, there are too many to list. I think The Black Company (Glen Cook) was revolutionary. Robert E. Howard, although a flawed person (aren’t we all?), wrote some marvelous stories. Same with H.P. Lovecraft and Clark Ashton Smith.
- Caim is the ultimate assassin, but he’s got heart as well. How did Caim come about and how much is he a part of you?
Let me answer that in reverse order. Caim is nothing like me. Although I started training in various martial arts when I was ten years old, I work studiously to avoid the kinds of violent situations where Caim feels most at home. Then again, both Caim and I have little patience for assholes, so you never know . . .
When I was planning the series, my main character was originally going to be a break-in artist. A cat-burglar who would avoid fights rather than engage. Yet as I fleshed out the story, I realized that I wanted a more visceral experience that included violence. That’s when I remembered a few chapters of a novel I had written years before and abandoned, about an assassin who gets betrayed by his employer and goes on a homicidal rampage. I took that character and retooled him to fit the story of Shadow’s Son. And the rest is history.
- What is it about assassins that you like so much?
I don’t particularly like assassins, although in another life I think I might have been a good one. I like reading about assassin though, because they break one of the basic rules of society. Thou shalt not kill. And once you go there, turning back is extremely difficult. That was the story I wanted to tell in this series, about one very flawed man’s attempt to redeem himself. Or at least to make sense of the shambles his life has become.
- Kit is one of my all-time favorite characters and one of the things that really sets this series apart. What was the inspiration for her? Who came first, the world (including shadows), Caim, Josey or Kit?
The story idea came first, including the primary characters. Things like setting and the shadow magic came later.
- Who is the character you most enjoyed writing, had the hardest time writing? (I guess they can be one and the same too)
Caim and Ral were the easiest. Their sections seemed to ‘click’ in my head without too much anxiety. Kit was more of a challenge when I had to write her perspective in the later books. Maybe I was self-conscious about trying to get her Fae-ness “just right.” And all the villains are pretty smooth for me. I like the darker sides of people.
- How did you come up with the language for the Northmen? I’ve been known to speak some German and I noticed at least a bit of Scandinavian influence.
I’m no Professor Tolkien, so don’t dig too deeply!
For the Northmen, I knew I wanted them to resemble the various tribes of northern Europe, so I started with Old Norse as a basis for the words and names, and changed them a bit to make it more unique.
- Do you have any plans to go back to the Shadow Saga now that it's finished, whether it's sequels, prequels or novellas?
The short answer is: not at this time. I think there's still a lot to explore with Caim and Kit and Josey (and Hubert, too), but I'm a one-project-at-a-time kind of guy and all my energy is going into this new book.
- What else do you have in store for us? I know there’s some mysterious “work in progress” going on, can you tell us more about it?
There’s always something in the works. Up next is an epic fantasy series centering around two soldiers captured by a foreign land ruled by wizard-kings (and –queens). These soldiers both fight to be free again, but their battles take them down divergent paths.
- What kind of writer are you, there’s always discussion about outliners versus free-writers? Do you fall into any of those? And what was the hardest part about writing this series?
The hardest part of writing this series was how to end it. Ending a novel is difficult enough for me as I try to pull together all the storylines and themes into something satisfying. Concluding a series is like that, but harder because you’re drawing that last novel to a close while at the same time pulling together the whole saga. Or, at least I tried to.
- Any advice for wannabe writers in getting published or just plain writing something people want to read?
There are a few things I’ve picked up that are as near to “rules” as I can see.
One, read. If you don’t love to read fiction, falling so deeply into a book that you lose track of time, writing as a profession probably isn’t for you.
Two, write. A lot. I write almost every day. That includes Christmas, my birthday, my wife’s birthday, and every day in between except when I’m on vacation.
Three, develop patience. Just about every aspiring author imagines their first book will be published, resulting in a life of fame and wealth. The reality is somewhat less impressive. You’ll likely write several books (including months of revising and re-revising each one) before you get published. This means years of toil for no pay and no accolades. Get used to it. Because once you are published, riches and awards are the exception, not the rule. You might be the next J.K. Rowling, or you might die penniless and unknown. If you have talent in any other profession, I advise you (strongly) to pursue that instead. But if you simply cannot not write….
Four, develop a thick skin. Once you are published, your beloved book will be out in the cold, cruel world where people will trash it, mock it, and publically ponder whether or not you are an imbecile. If you are easily discouraged by negative criticism, save yourself a lifetime of abuse and take up knitting.
- How much of an impact do you think social networking, either through your own efforts or others has had with your series?
At first, I would have said none. But over the last couple years I have gained a small (but loyal!) social media following. They help me spread the word about my work, so I think it depends on luck and how much you put into it.
- Do you read every review of your books and does anything that is said influence anything you do?
I read all the ones that I know about. The interwebz is a huge place, so there are probably things said about my books (and me) that I never see. I like knowing how the series is hitting people. I don’t know if it actually influences me, except that if I saw the same criticism again and again and I thought it was valid, I might try to address it in future works.
But probably not. I’m a stubborn bastard at heart.
- If you were to see someone reading your book in public (like on a bus or something) what would you do?
Smile and go on with my day.

Tuesday, May 6, 2014
(UPDATED) DOCTORS of Janet Napoles, the alleged mastermind of Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF) scam, said Tuesday that the businesswoman can be discharged from the Ospital ng Makati (OsMak) anytime.
In a press briefing, Elsie Badillo Pascua and Efren Domingo, both obstetrician-gynecologists, gave Napoles a surgical and gynecological clearance.
Domingo said Napoles is in stable condition and can already walk properly.
He said they asked the authorities, who will decide if Napoles will be brought back to the Fort Sto. Domingo in Laguna, to properly arrange Napoles's checkup schedules.
Domingo said their main concern now is the follow-up checkup that Napoles has to undergo for her continuous recovery.
The businesswoman has the option to extend her stay at the hospital by seeking the blessing of the Makati Regional Trial Court branch 150, which hears her serious illegal detention case.
"Alam naman ni Mrs. Napoles na ang kanyang stay sa hospital was only for a limited duration, depending on her health condition. Ang korte ang nagbigay sa kanya ng ganyang privilege na mapunta siya sa hospital, so ang korte rin ang dapat mag decide dyan kung iko-continue pa 'yung hospital confinement," Justice Secretary Leila de Lima told reporters.
Napoles underwent surgery on April 23 at the OsMak. Doctors removed her uterus, two ovaries, and a mass weighing 650 grams.
Napoles has been detained in Laguna since September last year due to the serious illegal detention case filed against her by pork barrel scam!Dec 22, 2013|

The majority of what we will be looking at today accusations. Out earlier this week in court papers against Cheektowaga assembly Democrat. -- -- -- The allegations are they they range all over the place in court papers filed by three former employees of his they range from things like inappropriate comments to taking them out on dates all of these are charges but nonetheless a lot of the pressure is beginning to build right now. Both Governor Cuomo and the chairman of the Erie county Democratic Party have called for him to at least look at stepping aside if these are true. The up plaintiffs haven't really responded nor have there attorney other than to say. To New York State basically here we are these are charges we do plan on filing a lawsuit at some point down the road. And the paperwork earlier this week reserves the right to do that we have reached out to assemblyman devers Jackie has declined -- and several other requests from. A variety of media organizations across town we don't know where his head is right now in terms of sticking it out or perhaps looking at possibly quitting. We don't know what kind of legal offense he is mounting. But we're going to look at some of those issues today and I have to say right now by the way before the next two hours and done we're also going to talk a lot about the weather. Obviously this is a show that talks about political issues from time to time but I do want to be certain. That if there is the latest weather information get to you we will be doing that. A lot of that coming up in the 11 o'clock hour we're going to be going around town checking in at some of the places that have had a particularly rough time will be touching base with the National Weather Service.

Is it a matter of all cards on the table now or can we at least assume that the notice of claim doesn't play every single card. And future allegations in a courtroom could even be worse. I mean it is the quake -- Half two feet according that is plot the bull which -- -- -- -- equity meaning equally so normally a complaint would be. Very back the epic.

Is the common defense well -- she's she didn't seem to mind at the time. Gee this was something that I didn't think was making her uncomfortable because well we were together or or we are having fun there or. To what degree. Does the plaintiffs. Have to prove. That this was unwanted and how hard is it to do that as the defense that that to my mind would spring up automatically is something along lines of I didn't know what was uncomfortable it didn't seem uncomfortable to me she didn't mention it was uncomfortable. How big of a hurdle is that to get over in order to prove charges likeness. Well that rape is a pretty important. Issue and that is win and to the point at first. Rule about these acts and that -- very complicated area. It -- it waited. A year before. She complained about the acts that are are now subject of the complaint that will certainly be something that the defense will want to look into. It's played a complaint Wright and bay and there was no response. I see that after or at the that company or you know. Anybody one can't complain -- in their employment threatening that could be clear did not being. An and in that complaint I believe there are some some. Fact. Leave the complaint that there was no response. That in that very strong evidence that that that the victim the -- What -- -- -- complain wanted -- and app lead was abandoned. And and those kind of -- went to state complaint with the on the employer has the duty to prevent and correct promptly. Any any sexual harassment. And and any cop style work environments so -- your quest in -- I -- That complaint that was may you have to look at the employer have a book. What -- say you're there at 800 number you can call to complain. What you. However it's not that simple if you understand the psychology of people grab her and her being a brat. There is a psychological. Manipulation. That can make someone not able to complain right away. And that a lot not bleak take into consideration. In the sophisticated manner. But it is a problem. I knew we would get there sooner or later to me that is the crux probably have many of these cases. -- not in any position in my workplace to regularly. Criticize my boss and I don't mean that against him I just mean that that's the the nature of an employment situation. How often in sexual harassment cases do people not. Speak up or maybe not have the ability to speak up. I'm I'm not sure when you -- ability. To me because I deal with it. So often I have to tell you -- not a matter of worker -- -- thing is aren't they are options are their avenue for complaint. And and that and then a healthy employment. Reno would give. They're workers many different ways to complain. 800 number is an example a person can complain undertake here there. Or wherever they feel great. I'm there can be very hurt and there can be somebody outside the company -- -- -- -- -- and it -- be different locations. All of that is really important. To prevent -- kind of liability. But then what happens when you do -- it and going back to the ability. That I think you have to talk psychologists and psychiatrists and social worker in mental health counselor because. Somebody being sexually harassed. And is it is trying to bring formal complaint -- going to have a lot of struggle. I -- and a lot of -- year and so the ability to complain beyond the actual mechanism. Depend on the mental health. And that let a look at that meant that the plaintiff is experiencing. At the time and that company might want to complain. May actually be such emotional distress that they feel track. How crucial is it that a complaint is documented. I can and I can in these papers say yeah I talk to the boss the boss brushed aside. Need debt be documented in some way in order for us to proceed. Well every -- in my estimation. A -- that claim claim and complaint. Depends in some great degree on documentation. And so. They say that that include documentation documentation documentation and you mentioned social media that you mentioned. Picture. You know people have felt while they're they're a much more or we're much more able to report them with the kind of site that dark report. True flash is protect through Twitter and all that -- -- -- -- or documentation. Credible. Because otherwise I imagine it's just degrades very quickly into it he said she said kind of thing now.

She represents a lot of people on civil rights cases concentrates often on sexual harassment. At least certainly these cases come to the the the forefront when it's a charge against a politician.

Well I tell you that I may disagree with your premise. We may -- But before the break -- we are saying. That in some cases I guess. This rises to public attention when it's a politician. But you were saying that there is a lot of other cases out there that are perhaps just -- bad that we don't notice. Well I think it about sexual harassment is about power in the abusive power. So if you have an employment -- industry or focus that has been gender usually they have been mailed. On at the head of the home or female that they had at their home because sexual harassment can be. Done by by any person and adopt the same sex. Sexual harassment I mean it's a huge area. But what I'm trying to -- you with if you look at it and the terms of the land of power and the abuse of -- Almost as if the type of work being done is it relative. There has to be the imbalance of power in order for the sexual harassment took -- Well it can be pretty ill or are a parent to what I mean by that is the victim needs to believe. That the perpetrators have the power. To what could be a title that it. Truly. Powerful but but it's being used as. And as a as a powerful as a manipulation. And it ended that works that's enough but. It usually yet. Usually it is power and the abuse of power which goes back to why sometimes that so difficult for someone to complain. Someone we need their paychecks someone that. You know. Is worried about you know making the complaint for many reasons and -- court though in in that government. We are having a morning I'm not sure exactly what happened with the telephones they just suddenly went blank tennis there. Let's bring Lindy back in and pray that the phones cooperate for us. Lindy we lost you in mid sentence before this and I do apologize. You were saying that there are a lot of cases out there where where the imbalance of power.

In a certain way out but that of course that's not always the case but -- -- -- sometime back but not their act that are. How many cases like this do you take to court in a year. Well but not an easy question to answer I would say to that. I would say to that 50% of the cases that are. Sexual harassment and make BP curiously mixed in with gender discrimination and retaliation. Many of them at some point straddle. I'm does that mean that they may be in court. But they're they're several happened and ultimately the court goes to a trial or somewhere along the line. There is a willingness. To settle that may be on that actually may be a common interest for all parties. Give me a sense of the size of this universe though OK some of them settled in court. Com how much of this is out there. Well into what I -- One of the areas I focus on I would tell you that I would tell you that. We have a hundred workplace is just to take. To give them an -- number they are all I would tell you that sixty I'll be a hundred probably have a sexual harassment issue. Seriously the so day give or take 60%.

I thought some of the missions seemed a little short in CoD4, but I agree that it's a rivetting game. Veteran status certainly was quite hard but I managed it through to the end. 'Died' many times though before completion!
I think I still prefer CoD2 though, and I was quite miffed when CoD3 went to consoles only. Fighting alongside the Russians in minus thirty degree Celsius conditions certainly concentrates the mind! :o)) TC.

Don't ignore the multiplayer side of this game. I'll admit that the single player was the best I've experienced among the COD series, but it's the mp side of the game where things become intense.
If you like a fragfest then pick a crowded server (too crowded and it's basically team death match no matter what the gametype says it is). If you want some tactics though, pick a quiet server with just 3 or 4 aside.
Also, with the most recent 1.6 patch there were also released 4 new maps, and they're Very pretty.
I don't really feel that cod 4 relates much to cod2 or to cod1. The first cod was a game that required real skill to use the weapons accurately and though the graphics were kind of clunky it had a charm of its own. Cod2 was a totally different animal, not least because the skill factor dropped by a bucket load. Cod 4.....is very pretty, and great fun, but I'm not sure how much skill is actually required.

Have to agree with allthumbs, I would have been done with COD4 about a week after buying it had it not been for the excellent multiplayer side of the game. I agree too its questionable how much skill is involved, the more people per map the less you need, particularly with some of the sillier perks available in multiplayer, such as Deep Impact (lets you shoot through walls) and allowing people 3 grenades. That said, a game of 5 a side requires much more skill.
The 4 new maps are only for the multiplayer and to be honest I havent been that impressed with them. The broadcast one (based in the same location as part of a early single player mission, the tv studio one) is pretty good as is Chinatown. The pretty Creek map is ridiculously one sided (just pick to play as Spetsnaz or face taking a hammering) and Killhouse, well, with the perks I mentioned above its pretty random rather than skill.
Great game though, the multiplayer is a different beast from the single player and worth a try. Steep learning curve to it but well worth it, even for someone like me with the reactions of a slNow me and the Aud's gonna show you how it's done

The rare deal surfaced during the recent visit by Members of Parliament who form the Land, Natural Resources and Environment Committee at the National Assembly.
The legislators, led by the committee chairman, Mr James Lembeli, MP for Kahama, realized that there was a serious oversight during the exercise to sell a number of tourist properties formerly owned by the government, which are located within national parks.
Director General of Tanzania National Parks, Mr Allan Kijazi, told the MPs that the four tourist properties formerly owned by the state firm, Tanzania Hotels Investment (TAHI) operate within Serengeti National Park, Ngorongoro Conservation Area Authority and Lake Manyara National Park.
"The transaction is to the effect that, the buyer (in this case 'Hotels and Lodges Limited') fully owns the properties and the land on which they were built thus essentially making them owners of parts of the National parks. Mr Christopher Ole Sendeka, a member of the committee and MP for Simanjiro thought the act was a "blasphemy"; "No one can own any part of the country's coveted national parks, why did the state allow the transaction to take place in the first place?" he asked.
Other MPs wanted to know why the Tanzania National Parks did not buy the properties when TAHI announced their sales about a decade ago. TANAPA Director General responded by pointing out that Parastatal Sector Reform Commission had turned down their bid to buy the hotels.
"According to the PCRS a parastatal like TANAPA could not be allowed to buy another parastatal (TAHI) and therefore the properties were sold to a private firm," explained Mr Kijazi. Longido Legislator, MP Michael Lekule Laizer said the properties were built by taxpayers' money and he wasn't sure if the government got back the same value invested during their constructions let alone making any profit from the transaction.
Mr Saning'o Ole Telele, MP for Ngorongoro added that there have been complaints from local residents, who claimed that racism was also rife is hotels owned by foreigners. Former Tourism Minister Ms Shamsa Mwangunga in 2009, for instance, issued a stern warning to the management of Lake Manyara Wildlife Lodge, which was alleged to have refused providing services to Tanzanians, favouring whites and other foreigners instead.
However, the main concern was the fact that, owning such permanent structures situated in the heart of a national parks, meant that the possessor also owned the reserves, which at best is an insult to conservation. "Just as no person is allowed to lay claim over an area inside National Parks or Game Reserves; nobody should own any building or property in the same conservation area," stated the parliamentary committee in their joint resolution table by their committee chairman Mr James Lembeli.
And "Hotels and Lodges" really got a bargain from the deal: Lake Manyara Wildlife Lodge, for instance is the only Lodge located on the very edge of the breathtaking escarpment of Lake Manyara National Park, affording magnificent views down across the Lake. Ngorongoro Wildlife Lodge, on the other hand is perched on the rim of the crater at 7,500 feet above sea level, providing vertiginous views plunging down into the crater floor.
The Seronera Wildlife Lodge, strategically located in the heart of the Serengeti, one of the most important spots of Serengeti National Park, where visitors can witness lions hunting and actual killing. It is also where all game-drives and balloon safaris take place. There is also Lobo Wildlife Lodge, the most romantic safari lodge in East Africa, remotely located in the north of Serengeti National Park, on the migration route, hidden within giant volcanic rocks and providing an unrivalled bird's-eye perspective of the migration.
Other properties formerly under TAHI, but now owned by Safari and Lodges Limited include Zanzibar Safari Club, idyllically located on the shores of the Indian Ocean, Changuu Private Island Paradise (Prison Island), one of Zanzibar's best known attractions and Bawe Private Island, just 25 minutes dhow ride from the spice island of Zanzibar. It was also revealed that owners of properties located within Serengeti, for instance, pay very little concession fees of between US$ 4 or US$ 8 per room even though the normally charge between US$ 350 and US$ 500 per room.
The two properties located within Serengeti get over 20 billion/- from tourists every year, said Mr Lembeli adding that their earnings was 50 per cent of what Serengeti national park (with a revenue of nearly 45 billion per annum) gets. "You can therefore imagine if only two lodges earn 50 per cent of what an entire park like Serengeti gets, how much do all properties located within the park get per year? It could be ten-times what TANAPA gets from the park," pointed the Parliamentary Committee Chairman. Serengeti has a total of five lodges and nine permanent camp-sites with 2735 beds between them.Make the most of the education you’ve already begun.

What it was, in fact, was a temporary inflatable room set up in various locations around Juneau as part of a statewide Alaska Design Forum project designed to encourage uncommon ways of looking at public spaces. Part pop-up tent, part art installation, part social study, the Sho-Globe was created by REBAR, a San-Francisco design firm, and was designed to be interactive in the most literal sense — it was made to be occupied.
What did it feel like to be inside? One preschool visitor named Denali offered this enthusiastic response.
“It was like summer!”
His description was strikingly similar to the written project plan originally presented by REBAR artists; they wrote they hoped to create a “mini springtime” inside the Sho-Globe’s walls.
Insulated from a chilly wind and heated by the sun and human warmth, the air inside the Sho-Globe was decidedly warmer than the 40-degree temperature outside Friday afternoon.
Perhaps more remarkable, however, was the way the Sho-Globe, like summer itself, immediately buoyed the spirits of those who experienced it. Kids somersaulted on the AstroTurf floor, well-dressed state workers laughed and reclined on cushions — some visitors even danced, as the music of Bill Withers and Macy Gray issued from specially rigged speakers.
San-Franciso-based artists Blaine Merker and Adam Green, working with ADF’s Karen Larsen and a team of local volunteers, constructed the Sho-Globe last week in an empty storefront on Seward Street. Twenty-six sections of heavy plastic sheeting were fused together with household irons to form the double-layered exterior walls, and when it was ready to be inflated, a high-powered, battery operated air blower was channeled into the space between the outer layers, causing the structure to quickly billow out like an inflated parachute. The finished piece was about 8 feet tall and covered roughly 12-by-18 feet of ground.
The artists ran into a few snags during the construction phase, but said trial and error was part of the process.
“It’s an experiment in improvisational design,” Merker said.
The Sho-Globe also had elements of performance art. Deployment on the roof of the new parking garage Friday night was accompanied by the theme song from the 1968 film “2001: A Space Odyssey.” Merker and Green both wore white jumpsuits and carried the Sho-Globe from place to place in giant backpacks they constructed in Juneau. The packs, which Green estimated at about 80 pounds each, housed the structure and air blower, as well as a lighting system, speakers and other gear.
When deployed at night, strips of LED lights were set up around the perimeter of the globe, making the whole thing glow in a shifting array of colors. Thursday night, the team set it up in Marine Park, and welcomed a steady stream of bar patrons who were more than happy to climb inside. REBAR artist Green said people coming out of the bars were drawn to the illuminated dome “like moths to a light.”
The artists said they took Juneau’s weather into consideration when planning the piece, knowing they wanted to create a welcoming environment outdoors.
“I guess where we started with this concept was that we wanted to see how public space changed when the ability to be in it in inclement weather changed. We thought of creating a temporary ephemeral shelter we could move around. Then we thought of different ways to do that and landed on this inflatable idea,” Merker said.
They also knew they’d be deploying it during the Alaska Folk Festival, an unusually busy week in Juneau.
Friday night, perched atop the new parking garage, local musician Mike Bucy entertained the Sho-Globe’s visitors on trombone with an impromptu version of “Yellow Submarine,” touching off a round of singing.
ADF’s Karen Larsen said the REBAR artists were selected in part for their multi-layered, community-centered approach to art and design.
“There’s a lot of artists who just want to do their thing and not further the discussion on design and community,” she said. REBAR’s focus on reclaiming public space for public use fit perfectly with the Common Space theme, she said.
The Sho-Globe is one of five ADF Common space projects in progress this week around the state; in addition to Juneau, the communities are Homer, Nome, Anchorage and Fairbanks. Projects varied widely: in Fairbanks, artists and residents focused on the idea of reclaiming an abandoned high-rise; in Nome, the emphasis was on food and subsistence lifestyles, with activities that include scavenging, meal-making and the production of a cook book.
The Alaska Design Forum is a nonprofit made up of architects, artists and designers that has active chapters in Anchorage, Fairbanks and Juneau, the group organizes lectures, exhibits and hands-on projects throughout the state. In 2009, the group organized the Freeze project, in which artists from around the world met in Anchorage to create large-scale outdoor installations using snow, ice and light.

[Editor's note: This article is from the archives of the Catholic News Service. It is dated Jan-14-2003.]..
."
A Vatican source said the text was prepared largely by Jesuit Father Urbano Navarrete, now a retired canon law professor at Rome's Gregorian University.
In 1997, Father Navarrete wrote an article on transsexualism in an authoritative canon law journal and has been consulted by the doctrinal congregation on specific cases involving transsexualism and hermaphroditism..
But a source familiar with the document said recent medical evidence suggested that in a majority of cases the procedure increases the likelihood of depression and psychic disturbance.
-- A provision giving religious superiors administrative authority to expel a member of the community who has undergone the procedure. In most cases of expulsion from religious life, the superior must conduct a trial.
-- A recommendation of psychiatric treatment and spiritual counseling for transsexual priests. It suggests they can continue to exercise their ministry privately if it does not cause scandal.
-- A conclusion that those who undergo sex-change operations are unsuitable candidates for priesthood and religious life because of mental instability.
-- A conclusion that people who have undergone a sex-change operation cannot enter into a valid marriage, either because they would be marrying someone of the same sex in the eyes of the church or because their mental state casts doubt on their ability to make and uphold their marriage vows.
-- An affirmation of the validity of marriages in which one partner later undergoes the procedure, unless a church tribunal determines that a transsexual disposition predated the wedding ceremony.

Much like Joyce, who wrote the bulk of his works Ulysses and Finnegans Wake from his notebooks upon which were scribbled bits of conversations, languages, phrases, words that he found while walking the streets of the many cities he inhabited, I too create art from the pieces I pick up around me. All art in a sense is found art, the art of absorbing the world around you and re-creating it to find it again.
My passion for Joyce extends beyond my scholarship & continued reading of his works. For the past three years I have challenged myself to create pieces inspired by his texts. This year I combined my love of Steampunk and found object art with my ever-growing infatuation with Joyce’s Ulysses.
About My Materials: I used a variety of materials for this project which I sourced from local flea markets, estate sales, and garage sales. The majority of these materials are clock parts (from both grandfather clocks and wrist watches) and skeleton keys. Other items are a bit rarer like the typewriter keys, vintage jewelry, anchor, antique locket, locker key, antique key hole, light bulbs, computer circuit board, brass button, pocket watch plate, an antique cigar cutter (a very rare find), pages from a Mechanical Engineering textbook, and locker tags. I also used an old copy of Ulysses (Random House edition) for the following text: “clacked”; “Trieste-Zurich-Paris, 1914-1921”; “16 June 1904”; and “Cuckoo Cuckoo.”
About Me: I am a doctoral student at the University of Tulsa, the current Book Review Editor at the James Joyce Quarterly & a Steampunk Artist (under the name Bohemian Romance). I started my business two years ago on my tiny kitchen table and it is still growing. The name, Bohemian Romance, was the name of the very first pair of earrings I ever made and sold. Everything I make has its own personality, and often its own story. If you would like to purchase one of the pieces you see here, click here for my Etsy shop. If you would like to see more of my work, click here for my blog & website where I post Steampunk D.I.Y.S & various other information.

Coachmoss: I am a 32 year old Business and Computer Programming teacher at a southern New Jersey high school (close to Philadelphia). I also am Head Wrestling Coach where I work - how's that for an oxymoron? I'm divorced with a 7 year old daughter, but dating a pretty awesome girl (soon to be fiance) who is also divorced with a 5 year old son, so life is pretty good right now.
Coachmoss: A lot of my free time is spent with the kids and coaching wrestling. I also sell sports cards, memorbilia and coins on eBay on the side.
Coachmoss: I played most everything growing up, but my main sports ended up being baseball and wrestling. Once I hit high school though baseball took a back seat because I saw I could use wrestling as a vehicle to get me through college and started training year round basically for that.
Coachmoss: Cal Ripken, Jr. was always my favorite player growing up. Recently I enjoy watching Chase Utley because of his hard work ethic.
Tec: What has been your favorite real-life sports experience or memory?
Coachmoss: Being able to see both of my favorite teams in the playoffs recently (Phillies and Orioles) and also being there for the World Series celebration in 2008 for the Phillies was something I will never forget.
Tec: What's been your most memorable non-sports experience in your life?
Coachmoss: It's hard to top anything to do with the kids lately. My daughter recently graduated Kindergarten and started 1st grade. My soon to be step son also just started Kindergarten and wanted to sign up for wrestling, so being able to help and coach him is going to be really rewarding too.
Tec: If you were an HBD player, what position would you play and what would your ratings be?
Coachmoss: When I played baseball it was mostly 2B, so I'd be a 2B with high contact and speed, but low power. I don't think I ever hit a triple or homerun in my life, but could find holes pretty well and rarely struck out.
Thank you coachmoss for participating in our latest Mantle World Owner interview, and good luck to you going onward.Posts from French

How to Make a Foolproof Quiche
If you haven't had quiche lately, it is time to remedy that situation. I could eat quiche for breakfast, lunch, and dinner without ever growing tired, but quiche is an especially good dish for a big Easter brunch or other spring-time gathering. You make it the day ahead, slice it just before serving, and then pass out the plates. This fool-proof recipe has yet to disappoint. acknowledge that I have an inordinately large number of "favorite poems" per poet, for which I make no apology. Today's selection is, among Wordsworth's poems, definitely top 10, and probably within the top 5. I memorized the first 4 lines of this poem when I first fell in love with Wordsworth in high school.
Form and discussion: The poem is an Italianate sonnet. If you spotted that without me telling you, then you win one point. If you realized that Wordsworth was working with iambic pentameter, then bravo to you, and take another point. If you spotted that the rhyme scheme is ABBAABBACDCDCD without me first telling you, then you may take yet another point.
Like all good sonnets, this one contains a volta, or a "turn". The turn occurs in the middle of the ninth line of the poem, with the words "Great God!" In the first 8-1/2 lines, Wordsworth talks about how modern man is out of tune with Nature, and is caught up in the world of materiality. (Mind you, "modern man" for Wordsworth lived in the early 19th century, yet 200 years later, I think this poem still rings true.) With his impassioned exclamation ("Great God!"), Wordsworth evinces disgust with being caught up in the materialistic world in which he dwells, and announces a break with the world of "getting and spending", finishing the thought with "I'd rather be a Pagan". The remainder of the poem is spent demonstrating that were he a Pagan, he'd be paying more attention to nature: standing in the meadow, looking at the sea, he'd be envisioning Proteus (a god able to take many forms) or Triton.
In the early 19th century, the phrase "Great God!" was used only in cases of extreme agitation, and while not blasphemous, was not the sort of thing one said unless severely vexed or dismayed. More particularly, in early 19th century England, which was decidedly Church of England-driven, one did not go about wishing to be Pagan (and thereby impliedly rejecting the church and also, by further implication, the state with which it was so tightly bound). Therefore, saying "Great God! I'd rather be a Pagan" was pretty strong stuff, and would decidedly have gotten people's attention (while indicating the extent to which the speaker was upset).
William Wordsworth was one of the first of the so-called Romantic poets. His early Romantic poems were included with those of Samuel Taylor Coleridge in the 1798 publication, Lyrical Ballads. While references to nature and use of metaphor are common devices in modern poetry, they are used in part because Wordsworth came along and wrote in the way that he did, with a reverence for and appreciation of nature, and with a focus on emotional response to nature and other stimuli. Wordsworth's poems focused on emotion, ideas and sentiment as much as they did on the natural world, often with some interconnectedness. Even today, I think they tap into many contemporary issues, which is pretty great for two hundred year-old poems.

Correction: The original title of the work was "Lyrical Salads."
As to the poem you have cited, tis meet and well, yet I prefer his less celebrated "Strange Fits of Passion I Have Known," again with an eye to the title.
The Title, Madam! The title tells the tale; tis Far more than a titular thing.

Jun 29, 2010, 11:20 PM EDT
ATLANTA — Mike Rizzo sees the 19 errors Ian Desmond has made in the first half of his rookie season. He sees the other mistakes Desmond has made in the field that don’t show up as errors.
Rizzo, though, knew this was likely to happen when the Nationals gave Desmond the starting job at the end of spring training, and he’s willing to live with it because of what he thinks Desmond can become in the future.
“He’s a young major-league shortstop,” the GM said last night after Desmond’s crucial error kept Stephen Strasburg from perhaps escaping the seventh inning. “And the best thing about young major-league shortstops is that they become second-year major-league shortstops.”
Desmond is not in the lineup tonight, but as you’ll read on CSNwashington.com, the Nationals remain confident in the 24-year-old to be their long-term answer at shortstop.

Mark, on some off day for the team, it might be interesting to follow up on Rizzo's comment that great short stops had error filled rookie seasons. I'm sure that's true to an extent but I'm curious about what a side-by-side comparison with Desmond would show–especially with players who had significant minor league seasoning.I would be more patient with him if he were a 20-year-old phenom but Desmond had hundreds of minor league games at short stop. Was his fielding record good in the minors?

Monday 12 September 2011 by Carlie Walker. No comments
1941, Tobruk, Tobruk diaries, Rats of Tobruk, AIF staging camp into work. Mail in – parcels and papers only – none for me. Pole did the Eucharist today. Len has a terrible cold and it’s only embryonic yet. Tamon reported Gardy in officer’s ward now and not so good – maybe for Alex. Intelligence reported today big air raid coming and everyone to take shelter – it did not come at all. Wren completed good water-colour of the harbour. Berlin tried to teach Tyrer chess but he lacks patience...
Bryant’s Diary: Saturday 13th September 1941
We arrived at Kantara in time for breakfast and crossed over the Canal. We reached the station at El Amriya and after a feed of stew went to the A.I.F. Staging Camp. During the night there was an air raid at Alexandria.
Cosgriff’s diary:Saturday 13th September 1941
What a night! Planes and bombs... Good round today for a change. Pole slept in, said Mass in his room instead of in the officer’s ward. I think it is Alex for him and me for the 43rd Batt. Colonel Evans (23rd) down there and he seems OK and efficient. Wrote to Con today re. his father’s death. Poles becoming bearers of new rumours – our planes bombing Jerry’s line and Sollum going again. It is rumoured that cruisers shelled 209 last night and that may account for the planes. Len in bed today – looks lousy...
Bryant’s Diary: Sunday 14th September 1941
As there were no parades today I went off to Alex AWL. Visited the 11th A.G.H. and saw Ted Taylor, who was wounded in the knee by a Polish officer when patrols from 17 and 18 platoons accidentally attacked one another. Ted has been doing very good work in Tobruk and has been made a Cpl.
Cosgriff’s diary: Sunday 14th September 1941
Terrific night – six bombs across hospital and ward one hit...no casualties. After Mass casualties from 32nd and 28th – successful show at last. Eyeties carved up and 5 prisoners. All the boys satisfied... Late Mass, good crowd and great singing. Norman here for m. tea but I was pretty busy – a-a- post hit and 5 killed. After lunch Owen called and we went to the beach to see Gardy – still sick and will be there for a week. Conroy, Pulver, Furnell there and many others for afternoon tea. Eyetie prisoners foretell attacks for next five nights to strengthen position taken last night. They used our tanks last night against us. Barnet and Matheson head to the beach today... The Johnston cold is better now. Beat the curate at chess last night...
Bryant’s Diary: Monday 15th September 1941
Left this morning on two day leave to Alex. We had a good time and went to bed so tired that I didn’t hear the air raid.
Cosgriff’s diary: Monday 15th September 1941
The usual blitz again from 3 am on, bombs close but no hits... Good round today. Deterred from visiting Gard by having to anoint a Pole... Len’s cold better but he has a stiff neck now. Bert Watson in today for supplies. Lyd Wilson – Walleroobie in today and he stayed for quite a while 2/13th Batt. Bombs close this evening – first in daylight for some time. Fr. Abbott here for tea – very handsome and pleasant. Had to anoint another Pole this arvo. Artillery going hard this evening and rumoured that there is to be plenty tonight. Evacuation tonight...
Bryant’s Diary: Tuesday 16th September 1941
Spent most of the day walking around Alex. I visited Ted Taylor again and he is coming along finely.
Cosgriff’s diary: Tuesday 16th September 1941
Good night at last...Awake before alarm... Met Phil and he is very breezy now. Daylight saving finished...Funeral of 2/12th blokes today – direct hit on a truck – 10 killed. Met John Totton – still a nice lad and doing a great job. Jerry at Sidi Berrani now. Cairo bombed at last. Article in Herald – all lies. Pop read it too. News at 8 pm now and pretty dead afterwards...
Bryant’s Diary: Wednesday 17th September 1941
We did very little in camp today and only paraded to organise the duties. There was a big raid on Alex during the night, but I didn’t hear a thing. We are to move to new tents tomorrow. Convoys have been moving up towards Mersa Matruh all day and night and it looks as if there is something doing in the desert very soon.
Cosgriff’s diary: Wednesday 17th September 1941
Another good night...Mass for Mary J. Good round today. Waiting for Phil with Gardy’s mail but he did not arrive. Ration truck let me down in ride to the beach. Let Polish chaplain do a funeral solo today. Stewart also went to the beach without me. Confessed to Barnett. Got ride with Polish driver. Read a book now en route to preserve my temper. Gardy going tonight. He had an hour’s notice – Missed his mail – left his Mass kit and I have his pay-book. Appears another brigade is to go out. Sidi Berrani – back to where it started – trap for Jerry but he woke up – Miss Gardy...
Cosgriff’s diary: Thursday 18th September 1941
Quiet night at beach. Mass in Mess – tent. All the Poles there but not many Australians... Back here at 10:30 with Gardy’s mass-kit – note from Honner 2 dog wire gone astray – rang Movement Control – no word of it. Honner and Steele in this arvo. Honner about 2 stone heavier – Payne’s urgent signal for fishing tackle. Sent Tom’s Mass-kit with John Hoddetts who knew nothing of their movement. Pioneers 43rd, 28th, 3rd Amb. and 12th Fd. Regt?

Actually both are a massive lie- both the wild food and myself have been fairly active. HGC Private courses have been well underway since mid-January and the wild larder seems under the impression its already spring, so there is plenty around for the keen forager as you are about to see. Although keeping tabs on the early appearance of spring greens, I’ve been more preoccupied with design and planning- our new Tree house HQ which is now well beyond the design stage and the first components or ‘Hardware’ are currently being forged down the road by the Glynde Blacksmith- Exciting stuff!
Whilst on the subject of tree houses, we will be launching our kickstarter campaign for our new tree house HQ in the next couple of weeks- so watch this space and please get involved- got some pretty fancy rewards lined up as I’m sure you can imagine!
Wild Horseradish: Already on the move...in February!
So, salsa verde…
If you’ve never had the delight of sampling salsa verde, then you should probably change that pretty quick- it is the amalgamation of pure genius for the palate. The direct translation is ‘green sauce’, sounds about as glamorous as ‘gravy’. But then everyone loves gravy.
Salsa Verde does vary from place to place, the classic Italian version includes parsley, capers, garlic, onion, anchovies, olive oil and a dollop of mustard. Other variations on the theme include the Argentinian chimmichurri- a similar grouping of ingredients with the addition of chillis and oregano. In Mexico it includes tomatillos, coriander and jalapenos. Other versions include different varieties of herbage: the frenchies use parsley, tarragon or sage although these days along with the demise of their gastronomic genius, it has become some sort of mayo with tarragon. Béarnaise I think we call it…
Unexpectedly, it is zee Germans that historically have the most ‘wild’ version out there using the following seven herbs: borage, cress, sorrel, chives, chervil, salad burnet and parsley. Even dill, lemon balm and lovage have been used. Well played.
Fresh: (L-R) Alexanders, Three Cornered Leek, Sorrel and Ground Ivy.
Salsa Verde is in essence is a sharp or piquant sauce, green in colour and designed to accompany meat or fish, it also works well with potatoes. In fact it so good, I’ve even had it on toast and had that ‘secret lemonade drinker’ moment with a spoon before bed. Good shit it most certainly is.
For something that is around 2000 years old, it pleases me a huge amount to be using wild ingredients to re-create an archaic recipe. The issue with many wild food books and the recipes they contain is the lack of adventure found amongst there pages. Don’t get me wrong, both Richard Mabey’s Food for free (1972)and Roger Philips Wild Food (1986) are both very worthy tomes when it comes to getting into wild food, dare I say it they are considered bibles to most hedgerow fondlers. But, as you can see from the original publishing date the 70’s and 80’s were not a culinary high point in the UK…
Many other recent foraging books often with ‘wild’ thrown in to the title somewhere just to reassure you you’re going slightly off the beaten path, sadly don’t vary much on past themes. In order for wild food to really be accepted in the 21st century and encourage folk to use it in the kitchen on a daily basis, stuff needs to be updated, experimented with and fooled about with. Fortunately there are those out there that are playing around with these flavours and giving them the spin these wonderful ingredients deserve: Hank Shaw in the USA at Honest-food.net, Mark Williams of Galloway wild foods, Robin Harford of eatweeds.co.uk and our very own head of the kitchen at HGC Dave Fennings of foragesussex.com to name a few.
I have made salsa verde on many occasions, I have even played around with a sorrel verde with my good friend Tom the Hungry Cyclist, but this recipe took a full blown taste test to get it bang on and working just right for the palate.
You would think that because most versions of ‘green sauce’ include parsley, that cow parsley or wild chervil would be on the list. Absolutely not. Whilst cultivated parsley is very handy, Cow parsley does little to excite the taste buds. In fact nothing. You would be better off eating grass. Also worth taking note- cow parsley is part of the carrot family whose other umbellifered brethren include two nasty lookalikes: Hemlock and Hemlock Water Dropwort which will put you six feet under pretty quickly- the toxic alkaloids respectively Coniine in Hemlock and Oenanthotoxin in Hemlock Water Dropwort are not to be fooled with.
Right, back to the safe wild edibles that you DO want to use. The best thing about this recipe is that the wild components are all very common, plentiful and easy to identify. Taking note from the original ingredients of salsa verde, the following wild plants were selected to take part in accordance with their culinary merit:
Ground ivy:
Also known as Ale Hoof, because it is has a shape resembling a hoof print and used to be used to flavour beer before the introduction of Hops. Needless to say it has a pungent aroma and strong taste- herbaceous in every sense- notes of rosemary, sage, mint and thyme all present when crushed. This is the ultimate wild ‘all herb’ and one of the most useful wild ingredients in the HGC kitchen.
Ground Ivy: Think Horse hoof.
Sorrel:
Doesn’t need too much of an introduction- this lemony leaf with heavy citrus notes is one of the most versatile of all the wild greens, great with fish, even better with meat. The tang comes from the Oxalic acid present in the plant. Very common in fields and a lover of grassy banks with unmistakable, glossy, shield shape leaves. It has been said the French use it a lot- that’s bollocks, they don’t. Best used raw, as it tends to discolour and lose its punchiness when cooked. Lemon zest really helps to bring out the flavour of sorrel.
Sorrel: Think Sheild shape.
Three-Cornered Leek:
Wild garlic’s superior cousin. Whilst wild garlic/ramsons/ramps are pretty useful in the kitchen the strength of them means they can often overpower everything else. Three-cornered leek has a slightly more subdued flavour, both garlicky and sweet making it the more desirable option. Often found in the most unlikely of places, the long glossy blades are usually overlooked because at a glance they look a bit like grass or pre-flowered bluebells. So named because if you were to slice one of the 'blades' in half, it has three corners. No mistaking them in flower- very pretty white flowers, perfect for garnishing.
Three Cornered Leek: Think...well, three corners.
Alexanders:
A non-native, brought over by the Romans as a potherb. Known as ‘the parsley of Alexandria’ due to its Mediterranean origins, Alexanders have settled happily into the UK, mainly near the coast, but I used to harvest a good patch in Battersea Park- see a more in depth post on them from the archives here. Also a member of the carrot family, this one is much more friendly, with a flavour somewhere between parsley and celery with a dose of aromatics which some can find not so pleasant or even ‘soapy’ . When used correctly, such as in this recipe- the combination of the other flavours really make it work perfectly. Over the centuries Alexanders have sadly fallen from favour and been replaced by celery.
Alexanders: Lining the roadsides round these 'ere parts.
Wild Salsa Verde.
(Makes 1 small jam jar- think Maille Dijon mustard size)
Ingredients:
- 1 handful of Ground ivy
- 1 handful of sorrel
- 1 handful of three cornered leek
- 1 handful of Alexanders
- (All finely chopped)
- 2 TBSP red wine vinegar
- 6 TBSP Olive oil
- 4 Anchovies (finely chopped)
- A few strong twists of black pepper
- ZEST of 1 lemon
- 1 TBSP of Dijon Mustard
Quite straightforward as far as preparation goes on this one, but it depends on whether you are a heathen or not. If you are, then stick everything in a blender and whizz it up on a series of pulses, be careful, as you don’t end up with a pale green baby food. To be quite honest if you’ve taken the time to gather these plants, you can take the time to chop them and mix them by hand- the consistency will be much better and the colour darker. You shouldn’t need to add any salt, as the anchovies will have taken care of that for you.
All of the above plants are out in force at the moment, so well worth going on a wander in between the storms to make a few batches. Should last for up to a week jarred in the fridge if you don’t eat it all in one sitting!

Our new “scan and return” procedure is working out excellent. Last Friday was the last business day of September. We recorded 510 documents, a busy day considering these market conditions. We are very pleased with the movement of the documents. No one waited more than five minutes for his/her documents. Four employees recorded documents and one scanned full time. When we first started “scan and return” I estimated that each employee could process 100 documents a day. Today, I would revise this estimate and say each employee could handle closer to 150 documents. Of course much depends on the type of documents being recorded. For instance it is much easy to record and scan a single page document than a large condominium transaction. Our success at a volume of 510 documents makes me feel comfortable we will be able to handle more documents when business picks up.
21 queries. 0.422 secondsIt’s only May, but the way the Patriots roster is starting to shape up, there are going to be some intriguing positional battles that will loom this spring and summer in New England. Here’s an early look at what should be the best:
Running back: Brandon Bolden vs. LeGarrette Blount. We’re going to leave Stevan Ridley out of this one, because any running back who rushes for 1,263 yards in a season before the age of 24 has won the starting job, as far as we’re concerned. (In fact, the only back in Patriots history who had a better season before the age of 24 was Curtis Martin, who ended up with 1,487 yards in 1995 at the age of 22.) In addition, Shane Vereen will be primarily working as the third-down back and Leon Washington will show his value primarily on special teams, which leaves the two bruisers fighting for time behind Ridley as backups.
First, Blount: As a rookie in 2010, the 6-feet, 247-pounder (247 pounds? Yikes) rushed for a career-best 1,007 yards on 201 carries, adding six touchdowns. However, his production has dropped off dramatically over the last two seasons, to a point where he had 151 yards on 41 carries this past season in Tampa Bay. If he has anything left in the tank -- and it’s reasonable to assume that he does, given the fact that he’s only 26 and had just 41 carries last year -- he will almost certainly be the in the mix in 2013.
Second, as well as the emergence of Ridley as an elite back. The Patriots saw value in the chance to acquire Blount, but he can now serve as insurance if the 5-foot-11, 220-pound Bolden starts to feel too comfortable in his position.
X receiver: Aaron Dobson, Donald Jones, Josh Boyce, Mike Jenkins. This spot is wide open for several reasons, including that fact that the Patriots have struggled to fill this position in the offense the last few years. (They thought they had someone who could be that guy in Brandon Lloyd, but that didn’t work out.) Into the mix come four new faces, but it’s clear that if Dobson shows he’s ready, he should get the bulk of the snaps at the position -- he certainly has the skill set, the physical presence and pretty much everything else you look for in an X receiver at the professional level. Jones is an intriguing prospect who could add depth to the spot, while Boyce and Jenkins likely round out the depth chart at this point.
Defensive tackle opposite Vince Wilfork: Kyle Love, Armond Armstead, Tommy Kelly. If the Patriots show a four-man front with Chandler Jones and Rob Ninkovich at the ends and Wilfork in the middle, the big fella needs someone to play opposite of him. Last season a variety of players rotated through, including Brandon Deaderick and Love. (According to Pro Football Focus, Love played 592 snaps while Deaderick had 468 snaps.) Deaderick is gone, which should give something of an edge to Love, as he’s the only established vet who has playing time in the New England system.
However, newcomers Armstead and Kelly will provide some serious competition..)
While Love is probably the leader in the clubhouse for playing time at this point, Armstead and Kelly can certainly make a case to be situational players who are part of sub-packages on third down and other passing circumstances. In a perfect world, if you’re the Patriots, Armstead gives you the interior pass-rushing presence New England has lacked since Mike Wright left, while Kelly would follow the template put forth by another former Raider, Gerard “Big Money” Warren, who was very good as part of a rotation in 2010 and 2011 with the Patriots.
(UPDATE, 5:15 p.m.: Love was released by the Patriots Wednesday afternoon, which means that Armstead and Kelly now have the inside track on the job.)
Backup defensive ends: Jake Bequette, Jermaine Cunningham, Justin Francis, Jamie Collins, Michael Buchanan. Whether you want to call them defensive ends or end-of-the-line players, no one is going to displace Jones and Ninkovich as the primary edge guys. They work well together, and as we saw at several points over the course of the 2012 season, they have shown a positional versatility that allows them to flip sides on occasion. However, there’s an intriguing mix of young players who can offer depth at the spot, as well as the occasional ability to see some significant snaps.
Francis is likely at the head of the line at this point -- he saw some serious action down the stretch when Jones went down with an ankle injury, and while he was uneven at times, flashed positively enough to warrant consideration as the No. 1 backup right here. Bequette essentially took a redshirt year as a rookie, but showed enough pass rushing ability as a collegian (he had 23.5 sacks at Arkansas) where he should at least get some consideration. Rookies Collins and Buchanan will be worked into the mix slowly, and while Collins showed plenty of potential as a pass rusher in his last two years in college (he had 16.5 sacks in his last two years as a collegian), his versatility may allow him to fill another need, at least as a rookie.
Speaking of versatility, Cunningham spent some quality time as an interior pass rusher last season, and could also prove to be a factor again this season as a situational player on the inside and outside.
Strong safety: Adrian Wilson, Steve Gregory, Duron Harmon, Tavon Wilson. A really interesting spot that will invite scrutiny over the spring and summer months. Wilson is unlike any safety the Patriots have acquired under Bill Belichick in that he’s built like a linebacker. Depending on how much he still has left in the tank, he could be called upon to play the “money” position in the Patriots defense on occasion, where he would fundamentally work as an extra linebacker.
His primary competition at the spot -- at least right now -- figures to be Gregory, who formed a really good pairing with free safety Devin McCourty down the stretch. It’s important to remember that Belichick likes his safeties to be able to play both safety spots, and Gregory has that experience at both safety positions (he’s also played some cornerback). That versatility could come into play if the Patriots wanted to use Wilson as an extra linebacker on occasion.
As a rookie, Harmon will likely be asked to make his primary contributions on special teams (alongside fellow defensive back/special teamers like Matthew Slater and Nate Ebner). Like most of the rest of the safeties, he also has some versatility in that he played both safety spots as a collegian. Meanwhile, Wilson is likely in a spot where he will be asked to provide depth, at least to start. He saw some quality snaps last year as a rookie, but when the Patriots acquired Aqib Talib in November, they moved McCourty back to safety, and as a result, Wilson’s playing time dropped off substantially.Review: Chinglish (Goodman Theatre)
A charming if half-baked confection

Two-time Pultizer Prize finalist David Henry Hwang is already well represented in Chicago–with Silk Road Theatre Project’s successful revival of Yellow Face (our review), a satirical fantasy about the perils of non-traditional casting and racial stereotypes.

Like the film “Lost in Translation” (which uses its Japanese setting much better to convey cultural isolation as well as the mixed messages that complicate relationships and contracts), “Chinglish” employs supertitles rather than subtitles to deliver the “double takes” of minor and major misunderstandings. Coming fast and furious, these instantly illustrate the treacherous tricks that happen when idioms get mistranslated, either too literally or too abstractly. Almost half the play is in Mandarin Chinese: The comedy is not fooling around when it comes to impersonating culture shock.
Daniel Cavanaugh (bumptious James Waterston), a casualty of the Enron scandal, is hoping to recoup his losses by giving his Ohio sign-making company a new lease on life—in a very distant market. He seeks help from a volatile Australian émigré (Stephen Pucci), who can translate well but can’t hold his tongue when dealing with the Chinese officials’ courteous deceptions and elaborate double talk. Daniel thinks he’s found a more reliable ally in Xu Yuan (Jennifer Lim, subtle and sprightly), a mid-level government flunky whose idea of adultery is as much a negotiation as any business deal. All but inscrutable, she’s got designs against her boss Cai Guoliang (a minister of culture embroiled in nepotism and influence peddling). So, even more than in the U.S., in this hot-house world of intrigue that passes as Guiyang, the personal is the political and all’s fair in love and networking.
Continuing Hwang’s collaboration with Leigh Silverman (who staged the original “Yellow Face”), Goodman’s fast-moving, two-hour debut features dazzling revolving sets by David Korins that deliver instant and cunning locales, claustrophobically lit by Brian MacDevitt. These along with very slick work in two languages from a deft, cross-cultural cast keep this more than just an extended joke about funny English signs in Chinese hotels.
The problem is the play’s pull-out-the-plug ending: Its abrupt and even desperate resolution suggests that Hwang doesn’t know how to sort out his tangle of foreign mis-relations. He uses the opening and closing scenes–depictions of Daniel’s Powerpoint presentation on the difficulties of conducting business abroad–as a cop out as much as a framing device. We need a bit more closure than a giant theatrical shrug indicating “Well, you never know, do you, folks!”

There are no comments yet. Why not be the first to speak your mind."I must say it was a good experience," says Amitabh Bachchan about the latest celebrity special on Kaun Banega Crorepati 2, bringing together tennis sensation Sania Mirza and beauty queen-turned Bollywood star Lara Dutta.
"We've got Sania and Lara together for a Children's Day special," says Star TV Chief Operating Officer Samir Nair.
"Why these two? Well, Sania needs no justification. She's a youth icon, and though she's the queen of endorsements, she needs no endorsement. Getting her on the hot seat was a challenge, and we proved equal to it.
"We needed a spunky, spirited woman of today to complement Sania on the hot seat. Lara fitted the bill perfectly. She's young, articulate and intelligent. They're very, very watchable together. Both Lara and Sania represent the spirit of youth and are role models for kids. Like Sania, Lara started very young. She became Miss Universe when she was in her teens," he adds.
"Ask Mr Bachchan, Lara and Sania are dynamite together."
The Children's Day special, to be telecast on Sunday, November 13, has many interesting interludes, not just with the two star guests but also involving their families.
"Sania's father is on the show along with her mother and sister. Everyone always wanted to know what Mr Mirza is like; Mr Bachchan finds out for us. AB talks quite extensively with Sania's dad about many subjects, including her money," Nair reveals.
Sania's dad reveals how expensive it is for his star daughter's entourage to be carted from one international venue to another.
"But the best part of the show is the chemistry between the two ladies -- very very appealing," Nair adds.
How much prize money do this dynamic duo finally obtain? No one's officially telling. But Sania and Lara apparently go up to Rs 1 crore, and then lose money by giving the wrong answer.
Star TV has at least two more celebrity specials lined up this season on KBC. Hrithik Roshan will appear with Priyanka Chopra, and if all goes well, we'll see Abhishek on the hotseat with his mega-anchor dad in the grand finale.

Rivalling the catwalks of Paris, Milan and New York, Oakville will be the place to be as the local May Court Club stages its bi-annual fundraising fashion show Thursday, April 18.
“It’s like watching the red carpet at the Academy Awards — entertaining and it’s going to be incredible,” said Charlotte Riddell, past-president of the May Court Club of Oakville.
Riddell and Patti Hnatiw, also a past-president, are co-chairing the Mirror Mirror Fashion Show Runway Tour 2013, set to take place at the Oakville Conference Centre, 2515 Wyecroft Rd.
The local non-profit women’s volunteer organization puts on its charity fashion show to support its in-house initiatives, such as its high school scholarship, and elementary school lunch programs, as well as the cyber-bullying puppet show that visits local primary schools.
In addition, proceeds go towards funding local May Court-supported charities and organizations, such as the Wellspring Birmingham Gilgan House.
“It’s all about raising funds in the community and giving that back, and providing services locally — giving our time, talent and treasure,” said Hnatiw.
Tocca Finita and M for Men will be supplying the clothing for this year’s fashion show.
In fact, local fashionista and owner of Tocca Finita Anna Rea put on her first fashion show benefitting the May Court Club 25 years ago and is celebrating that milestone at this year’s event.
Rea has been involved with and contributed to the May Court Club since her first show in 1994 — this year’s event will be her fourth fashion show with the organization.
“It’s an honour to work with a wonderful and great group of women that make a difference in our community. I’ve always been a believer in ‘Give where you live’,” she said. “And it’s a perfect fit... I love the partnership with them because these women work very hard and they are making a difference in our community.”
Celebrating her 25th year in business, it made sense to partner up with the May Court Club, said Rea.
“A lot of the committee members are clients, so this is a way for me to give back to the people who have helped me in my 25 years in business,” she said. “I have also produced about 15 items that are all Canadian-made by Canadian designers and 10 per cent of those sales will be donated back to May Court this year.”
Show organizers are expecting 450 people to attend this year’s event, which will include a three-course dinner, silent and live auctions, a draw for a Gucci pendant, necklace and earrings set, in addition to the spectacle of the professionally-produced fashion show.
The evening begins at 5:30 p.m. with cocktails, and dinner at 7 p.m., followed by the show.
Tickets cost $125 for general seating or $154 for premium seating next to the runway.

MANILA, Philippines — The National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) has joined the police in investigating the incident surrounding comedian and television host Vhong Navarro.
Navarro was severely beaten by a group of men last January 22 inside a condominium at the Bonifacio Global City in Taguig.

Teams of officers are visiting area scrap metal yards to educate owners on city and state ordinances designed to keep the business honest. Officials hope the legitimate dealers will take a pro-active stance in helping to identify those who are less than honorable in their businesses.

His latest volume, Roots and Blues: A Celebration, explores the African-American experience and how the blues evolved out of it, but it can also be viewed as an autobiographical portrait of the vital importance that music and African-American culture have played in Adoff’s genesis as a writer. As he writes in “Chained,” “Always: this melody of words is journey home.”

Combined with illustrator R. Gregory Christie’s arresting acrylics, Adoff’s sonorous, spatially oriented poems powerfully depict the roots of this essential American genre in this book that we called an “incandescent, important work.” With nearly 40 volumes under his belt, the 75-year-old Adoff is happy to talk about his own poetic development.
What was in you first, music or poetry?
Well, for me personally, I discovered girls and poetry about the same time. And I was about 10 or 11, so I was always in love, and I was a really serious reader—Shakespeare’s love sonnets, for example, at a pre-pubertal age you know was just a crazy thing, but my house was full of books, and that was one of the things that I grabbed a hold of. Frankly, it was a time when there were one-sided shellacked phonograph records, mostly classical music, but even Scott Joplin’s stuff that my grandmother, who lived in the same apartment building in the Bronx, collected.
But the radio was my opening to the world because it was not the rigid format that it is today. The DJ would play anything from one extreme to the other, from any and every genre. And listening to New York City radio stations at a young age, when I was up late at night studying for an exam or getting away from studying, all of a sudden I would be down in Mississippi with the Five Blind Boys, listening to gospel. Kids and adults don’t get that anymore today. But the whole world was open to me...
At a very young age, I fell in love with jazz. There was a jazz bassist composer, a genius named Charles Mingus, who I met when I was an undergraduate at City College in the early 1950s. He tolerated me, and he became in my life really a second or third father. I’ve had three fathers: my own father, who was a pharmacist; a wonderful Filipino-American poet named José Garcia Villa, who was a professor at The New School and who I studied with intensely back in the early ’60s; and then Mingus—in fact, I met my wife [the late Virginia Hamilton] and the whole jazz world through him back in the late ’50s, so my evolution was at once recognizing the universals, and then highlighting the differences and developing my own voice, as the cliché goes.
Elizabeth Bishop said her favorite example of iambic pentameter was “I hate to see that evenin’ sun go down.”
Oh, that’s sweet. I never heard that. I used to be a fan of hers when I started.
How influential do you think the blues has been in American poetry?
That’s the hardest question you’ve asked me. I think from my perspective, as somebody who’s a white kid, who’s also been married to a black woman and lived in black culture and has two biracial kids, I always see the hole rather than the doughnut, or the glass half empty. That’s part of my nature, and maybe that’s the way poets should be. So I always see a separateness of African-American and Eurocentric cultural particulars.
I really think if you’re a writer and you’re listening to something or reading something that you say is recreational, it isn’t really just recreational. If I go back to William Blake and to Whitman, to Cummings and Dylan Thomas, I’m happy to put them—from my conscious perspective—alongside Richard Wright and Ralph Ellison, and then go back to Big Bill Broonzy, as I was getting radicalized as a young teen.The need to evacuate a hospital can come without warning, and patients’ safety and well-being depend on a hospital and its staff being able to successfully execute an evacuation during the most trying of times. The Harvard School of Public Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Exercise Program (HSPH-EPREP), in collaboration with the Emergency Preparedness Bureau at the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, recently developed the MDPH Hospital Evacuation Toolkit which is meant to serve as a resource for hospitals to prepare their own comprehensive evacuation plans. The toolkit is designed to assist hospitals as they review and update their plans annually for partial or full evacuation, and it contains a main evacuation guide which describes planning for the evacuation from start to finish as well as a number of tools like job action sheets and spreadsheets that can be adapted and easily incorporated into any hospital evacuation plan.

Disaster can affect your farm in many ways:
- People are a primary concern: plan for the safety of yourself, your family, employees, visitors, and neighbors.
- When confined in buildings, pens, or even pastures, animals are highly dependant on you.
- Stored feeds, crops in the field, harvested produce, milk in the bulk tank, or meat in a freezer are at risk.
- Although replaceable, farm equipment often represents a significant amount of capital.
- The land is most resilient to disaster, but there are exceptions, including chemical spills, soil compaction and erosion, and ground water contamination.

The key parts of the sprawling Magic trade show include Project, Slate, Workroom and Pool. These are where the team found the most inspiring and directional graphics.
Pool Trade show & Project(Magic)
Here’s a quick fix of some of the key highlights that the team saw at the shows.
50s, 60s and 70s biker visuals and auto racing team graphics were a massive trend seen at many of the recent shows. Everything has a vintage edge to it with crackled, distressed looks being a key print technique. Although this graphic trend has been a round for a while we are seeing a surge of brands using this language as a key driver for the season.
“Great outdoors” graphics are getting a more “traveler hobo” feel, with hippie slogans and more earthy vibes being used as key hooks.
Entree LS, Palmercash, Ezekiel, Hips & Hair
Other key graphics highlights included – Comic book manipulations, 70s porn visuals, anchor graphics and photo print plays. (A more in-depth report will be published on Stylesight.com shortly).Mike Birbiglia Tickets

Fate Of Venice Post Office To Be Discussed Monday
Posted Oct. 30, 2011, 2:11 am
Mirror Staff
The Venice Post Office Task Force will meet this Monday, Oct. 31 at noon, with special guest Ruth Goldway, Chair of the US Postal Regulatory Commission, to discuss the fate of the Venice Post Office.
The meeting will be held at SPARC, 685 Venice Boulevard, Venice.
The United States Postal Service recently announced plans to sell the historic Venice Post Office.
The Venice Post Office Task Force, a coalition of groups including the Venice Neighborhood Council, Venice Beachhead, Los Angeles Conservancy, Venice Stakeholders Association, SPARC, Venice Arts Council and independent Venice stakeholders, joined together in a unified effort to save the Venice Post Office.
Their goal is to see that the Post Office is preserved as an operating post office.
In the event that the planned sale goes through, the Task Force will work to ensure that the building is preserved and public access to the famed Edward Biberman mural in the lobby is assured.
At Monday's meeting, the Task Force will discuss their goals with Ruth Goldway, who was designated Chairman of the United States Postal Regulatory Commission (PRC) by President Barack Obama on Aug. 6, 2009.
Goldway has presided over the Commission during a time marked by a record caseload and the implementation of new postal laws and regulations.
On her watch, the Commission has issued a number of major decisions including Advisory Opinions on Post Office Station and Branch closings.
The Venice Post Office building was a project of the Work Projects Administration (WPA). It was designed as a post office by noted architect, Louis Simon (1867-1958).
The Story of Venice mural, created by renowned artist Edward Biberman, looks over the lobby of the post office.
The mural depicts Venice founder Abbot Kinney, the vision of Venice that he had, and the way Venice looked in 1940.
Biberman is an icon of post war California Modernist artists, whose work appears in the Smithsonian, the National Portrait Gallery and LACMA, among other collections.

Sharing our pain, anger and honesty
By
Christine M. Flowers | (MCT)
Nothing touches the psychological third rail as saying that "addicts are selfish." Since my column on Philip Seymour Hoffman first appeared online , I've been receiving emails from all over the country with various levels of outrage, self-righteousness and, most surprisingly, gratitude.
I expected the comments like "I want to bitch slap you" from the woman in Florida who said that her son had just died of a heroin overdose. The supercilious tsk-tsking from those in what I call the industrial-addiction complex was hardly surprising, either. They took me to task for my ignorance, including the self-described therapist who told me that she understood that I had the right to my opinion but that it was dangerous to express that opinion. It's as if calling Hoffman "selfish" would burden recovering addicts with unhealthy guilt. Personally, I think it is the lack of guilt that lies at the root of the injuries we inflict on others, if not ourselves.
But what really struck me with more force than the bolt that hit Saul on his way to Damascus was the volume of readers who agreed with me that Hoffman was selfish in failing to consider how his actions would affect his babies.
There, I said it again and will continue to say it until the last co-dependent parent writes to call me a jackass because his daughter just got out of rehab and I apparently don't know what the hell I'm talking about.
But I do, you see. I have never made a secret of the fact that my family has been touched by addiction, several generations' worth. Years ago, in a less generous age, it was called being a "lush" or a "dope fiend" or any other of the words we are now taught to avoid out of sympathy and good manners.
But it doesn't change the fundamental nature of the beast to wrap it up in shiny paper and place it alongside leukemia and cystic fibrosis and muscular dystrophy and say, "Look, it's a disease just like all the others," and that the addict is no less diseased than one of Jerry's Kids.
I disagree.
So, I was amazed to find out, do hundreds of others, all of whom wrote to tell me that they were surprised that I had the balls to speak truth to political correctness.
More than balls, it's just a deep-seated anger that comes from being forced to watch relative after friend after acquaintance destroy themselves and their families because they decided to stick that needle in their arm, or take that first hit of coke or, if they had the money of Hoffman, buy thousands of dollars' worth of heroin.
I have been schooled this week in the vocabulary of addiction. I have been told that the addict is out of control, that there are synapses in the brain that react to chemicals, that there are compulsions and obsessions that don't respond to reason and can't be halted by normal stimuli. The homegrown therapists and those who make a habit of attending Al Anon or reading self-help books were generous with their time, and their profanity.
But the great joy in this experiment was hearing from the family members who thanked me for validating their suffering, for pointing out that while an addict might very well be incapable of abandoning that road to destruction, the people who love him are justified in saying, "Enough, I'm finished, you have cut out my heart."
People like Sally, who said, "I am a survivor of breast cancer and lost both my parents to cancer you said exactly what I think."
Like Connie, who said "I am sick of all the levels of sainthood Philip Seymour Hoffman has attained just by killing himself."
Like Nathanial, who admitted his addiction and said, "It's important to me not only to live for myself but for my family as well; when I lose sight of my purpose then I am on my way to my destruction."
People like Jim, who said "What Hoffman did was very selfish and I think that calling it what it is is the right thing to do you can't just sugarcoat everything bad about society."
There were more, several hundreds more. And the emails are still pouring in.
It amazes me that there is this untapped well of pain out there, forced by a society of fabricated tolerance to remain hidden at the risk of being called vicious cruelty.
I have been conditioned to believe that my own strain of Spartan intolerance is unique, or shared only by those who have as one writer said hate in our hearts.
But voices from Indiana, Alaska, Miami, New York, San Diego, Iowa, Texas and Pennsylvania convince me that it's not.
There is love, yes, and support and a true desire to see the addict move on from his death valley into the light.
But there is also a willingness to say "enough!" and a refusal to be shamed into silence.
Hoffman's children deserve to be seen. Survivors deserve to be heard.
This is my thank you note to the ones who reached out.

(CBS)
SAN FRANCISCO (BCN) — A former leader of the San Francisco branch of the international MS-13 criminal gang pleaded guilty in federal court Monday to charges of racketeering, murder conspiracy and gun use.
Ivan Cerna, also known as “Tigre,” 34, entered the plea before U.S. District Judge William Alsup in San Francisco and will be sentenced by the judge on March 29.
The MS-13, or La Mara Salvatrucha, gang originated in Los Angeles and is made up of Salvadoran and other Central American immigrants and descendants of immigrants, according to a 2008 grand jury indictment filed against Cerna and 28 other alleged gang members.
The indictment accused the alleged members of drug dealing, robbery, extortion and violence, including murder to protect their turf.
MS-13 is now found in 20 U.S. states, Mexico, Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, the indictment said. The gang’s name is believed to be a combination of words meaning gang, Salvadoran, and “fear us.”
The San Francisco branch, or clique, was known as “20th Street” and was centered at 20th and Mission streets, the indictment said.
U.S. Attorney Melinda Haag said Cerna admitted to leading the San Francisco clique between 2004 and 2006, and to agreeing with other members that the group would attempt to murder rival gang members and people who cooperated with law enforcement.
He pleaded guilty to racketeering conspiracy; conspiracy to commit murder in aid of racketeering; and use or possession of a gun in furtherance of a violent crime.
He faces a possible maximum term of life in prison.
In addition to the 29 people originally charged, five more defendants were added in three revised indictments.
A number of them have pleaded guilty to various charges, and the remaining 13 defendants are due to go on trial in Alsup’s court on March 7.
Two of the other guilty pleas were made before Alsup on Friday.
Aristides Carcamo, also known as Indio, 32, pleaded guilty to racketeering conspiracy, murder conspiracy, possessing a gun for use in a violent crime, and conspiracy to rob a jewelry merchant in 2008.
He faces a maximum possible sentence of life in prison and will be sentenced by Alsup on March 22.
Jose Quinteros, also known as Fantasma, 25, pleaded guilty to racketeering conspiracy and conspiracy to commit assault with a dangerous weapon. He will be sentenced April 5 and faces a penalty of up to 23 years in prison.

Ella's third birthday
Party Recap
My daughter's third birthday is probably my favorite party I've planned. Not only because I love silhouettes but it was also the beginning of my party planning business, Lovely Little Parties. Being that her birthday falls a week before Christmas (which creates some challenges), I decided to have the guests decorate gingerbread houses as an activity. Once completed, they were able to take home to enjoy during the holidays along with a personalized apron.
This party was truly a labor of love from friends and family. The mini cupcakes and marshmallows were made by Ella's grandmother and displayed on a cake stand that belonged to my great, great, grandmother. The birthday banner that greeted our front door as guest arrived was made by Ella's great grandmother. The silhouette cookies, cake and macrons were made by local pastry chef, Martine's PAstries. All photography was by super sweet and talented, Melanie Mauer.
Party Highlights
Desserts
The main focus was on the dessert table. Guests were served macrons, homemade marshmallows, mini cupcakes, silhouette shaped sugar cookies, and of course, birthday cake!
Activities / Games
Because of the age group and the location, which was our home, we kept the activities pretty low key. We did have a pinata that was made with lots and lots of tissue roses thanks to the help of two friends. The children happily decorated their gingerbread houses and were content playing with Ella's toys.
Party Favors
Guests decorated gingerbread houses that could be used throughout the holidays for decor, along with a personalized apron.
Best Moment
The best moment was seeing the happiness on my daughter's face. She loved having her closest friends to celebrate with her and you could just see the joy on her face as they arrived. It was also a sweet moment watching as she blew her candles out on her cake.
What People Ate
The food was kept light and consisted of mini fruit kabobs, veggies with dip and sandwiches in the shape of Ella's silhouette
What People Drank
Water, tea, pink lemonade and strawberry milk for the kiddos!

ReviewsNot only are four Detroit Tigers heading to the All-Star Game, but another big name will be joining them: President Barack Obama. According to Sports Illustrated, not only will the President throw out the first pitch (becoming the first President to do so since Michigan's own Gerald Ford) but he'll also join Joe Buck in the broadcast booth during the game.
July 12, SI.
Obama is scheduled to throw out the first pitch Tuesday in St. Louis at Busch Stadium. He will be joined by former Presidents George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George H.W. Bush and Jimmy Carter in a seven-minute video address to be aired during the pregame ceremony. The video will honor 30 Americans whom MLB and People magazine have recognized for service to their communities.
Major League Baseball says the video will mark the first time all of the living U.S. presidents will participate in a ceremony at a sporting event. Following the video, Obama will throw out the ceremonial first pitch. The last sitting president to throw out a first pitch at the All-Star Game was Gerald Ford, in 1976. "We have asked [for Presidents to throw out the first pitch] on a couple of occasions, but I think this year it's so appropriate given the scope of our pregame program," says Major League Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig. "It is very consistent with what President Obama has done. I wrote to him and he immediately accepted.">>

It's hard not to be underwhelmed by Google Buzz, which was widely trailed earlier this week as being Google's Facebook/Twitter-killer. It's unlikely to kill either of those services since it doesn't seem to add anything significant to what they do and it appears not to take any of the existing functions of Facebook and Twitter and do them better.
Google Buzz is better thought of as simply another social media aggregator. As Paul Buchheit, the former Google engineer who created Gmail and founded social aggregator FriendFeed, put it: "There's a FriendFeed in my Gmail."
Still, as with most new social networks, it's hard to judge Google Buzz at this point. It's like being one of the first at a party. Perhaps nobody will come or perhaps everyone will show up and it will be great.
Google has gone some way to dealing with this problem by turning Buzz on for anyone with a Gmail account and then auto-following certain people on your behalf based on who you email most often. This is the one key advantage Buzz has – the potential to tap into a huge, already-existing network. The problem is that unless those people actually do something there remains disappointingly little buzz.
There are plenty of possibilities for how Google Buzz will develop but it looks, at this point, like a service for people who spend most of their time using email and very little on social networking sites – if they're even on them at all. However, these people have lots of friends on social networks and Buzz provides them with a lightweight way to keep up without leaving the comfortable surrounds of their email.
For it to be anything more than that, Google needs to offer some killer features.Ryan McGinness at Country Club LAJuxtapoz // Sunday, 15 May 2011

Crews took down the foot bridge over the Beltline at Seminole Highway on Madison's west side overnight.
The Beltline between Verona Road and Fish Hatchery Road was closed for 7 hour from 10 p.m. Thursday to 5 a.m. Friday to allow workers to take the bridge out.
Traffic was detoured to Highway PD.
The city plans to build a new pedestrian bridge in that spot in the fall.
Work on the Beltline is expected to be complete in 2016. The Verona Road project is scheduled to finish in 2019.
A stretch of road in Verona will close for several weeks beginning next week for a construction project.
State Department of Transportation Project Manager Greg Breck said construction on East Verona Avenue will begin Monday.
The DOT is adding bus lanes on East Verona Avenue and an additional bay to the Park and Ride lot. Workers will also connect bike trails up to the avenue and improve turn lanes at the intersections with Maple Grove Road and Old County Road PB.
Maple Grove Road and Old PB will be closed around East Verona Avenue for four to five weeks starting Monday, Breck said. Maple Grove will be open to allow access to Badger Prairie Health Care Center at 1100 E. Verona Ave.
East Verona Avenue will be reduced to a single lane during the construction, Breck said.
Signs will direct motorists to County Road M and Cross Country Road..

Ok here is what happen I have had my iphone 5 since Nov 2012 I have not synced it with Itunes at all and not done a back up on it at all either( I know I'm a dummy)... this morning I accidentally delete a running text that I have had going since Nov and need it back, I'm at work so can connect my phone to the computer but need to know how to get those text back... I thought by doing a icloud back up it would work but didn't want to try and fail!!
Ah, text messages! Well, if you hadn't been performing backups to either itunes or icloud, then I'm afraid they're gone for good.
oh no. (VentureBeat’s Matt Marshall notes that Seattle-based Farecast also will have some news at the conference).. TechCrunch has more details on the new service.Op-ed: Why does any Jew who criticizes Israel automatically become an anti-Semite?

Don Quixote devoted himself to tilting at windmills: In his imagination he viewed them as a menacing, monstrous enemy that must be destroyed. He is considered a romantic figure, a hero willing to sacrifice his life for the sake of his love and ideas. Yet with all this romance, people sometimes forget that Don Quixote did not fight real monsters, but rather, figments of his imagination. He was a hero, but a pathetic one.

Mosley, whose DNA police said was recovered at the crime scene, was arrested for the murders a few months after his DNA had been entered in a state database and compared with DNA from unsolved crimes.
See the rest of today’s story
Shocking, really.
once again one side of the story
One side of the story? Seriously? He may be innocent until proven guilty regarding the current charges, but his record of convictions and dishonorable discharge are facts. There is no other side to that story.
I’m just waiting for Really to comment how nice of a guy this perp is.
What more do you need to know to stay a hundred miles away from him.
there is always 2 sides of a story and how far back in the past is this?
like u dont have skeletons.
Heck no I don’t have skeletons like that in my closet, why whose skull have you crashed in lately, burn any buildings lately.
No I don’t think the average person no let me correct that, not even the average person has been convicted of the crimes this guy has.
I certainly don’t have skeletons of a criminal nature, no.
I suspect with the kind of friends “just concerned” has they all have “skeletons” in their closets.
If he was someone that you have known for the last 20 yrs you wouldn’t belive any of this. He is a nice person
Sorry Alice, don’t agree. I went to school with Mike and and I wasn’t *too* suprised. Shocked, but not surprised.
Mike was/is a really nice person at heart. He has an infectious laugh and was usually smiling and laughing. If you were his friend, I am pretty sure that he would do near anything for you. He is extremely giving and I know that he was a great father and coach. BUT, if you were on his bad side, watch out.
Mike *ALWAYS* played hard. He was an incredible athlete and a champion wrestler. Obviously he had a lot of aggression and he was fearless. I wasn’t too surprised to hear how well he handled it when an M80 went off in his hand and he lost half his thumb. I also wasn’t at all surprised when I heard he enlisted in the Army. Likewise, I wasn’t too surprised when I heard that he was discharged after serving time in the brig for burning down his CO’s barracks after a disagreement. While that was heresay, I believed it; due to Mike’s aggressiveness, fearlessness, and take-no-sh!t attitude. I have no doubt that Mike would have been an incredible soldier in the field; always there for his brothers and sisters and committed to fight to the end.
Bottom line…. Great guy most of the time. But I wouldn’t want to be anywhere near him when he was mad. I know he loved his girlfriend with all of his heart, yet he was arrested for punching her in the face. I honestly wonder if he was bi-polar.
It’s a shame that he never received the help he needed. It’s very unfortunate that the Army wasn’t able to help him.
My sympathy goes out to his girlfriend, kids and family.
Yes Really will respond
you self rigthous LIERS… it must be so wonderful to be NOT PERFECT…
every one of you have and an inncident whether you want to admit it or not.. you are no different and have no right to Crusify this man just because of some accusations… Maybe he did Maybe he didn’t but either way he has touched many in his time with us for the good so shut your mouth and go find something to do w all your time.
Mike and his family will continue to be welcome. why because he has never done anyhting to disrepect me or my family and he has brought joy to those he has touched…. how bout that..
you are entitled to your opinion however don’t play like you are perfect cause we know your not..
I wish the family well and hold on it will be a long bumpy road just know you have support..
REALLY!!!
Really, no one is claiming to be perfect, which by the way is not the argument here. Your friend may be nice to you but he’s a thug to others. If you can’t understand that, well that make yous either a thug or a moron. Either character is rather unsavory.
Really………….you need to open your eyes
How awesome is that DNA database for catching criminals? A murder about 8 years ago is being solved now because of it. I’m sure he never, ever expected to be picked up on it. Prisons are built for people like this.
@Really
…Really?!?!?!?! So the dishonorable discharge, the time in Leavenworth for arson, the assault conviction and now suspect in a double murder, and you still think this guy is awesome? You’ve got to be a friend, relative or mental incompetent to not at least think that there may be some possibility that this guy may have some serious, serious issues.
I personally don’t associate with arsonists or suspected murderers, but that’s just me. I tend to worry you get on the wrong side of someone like that, they burn down yer house or want to bust your head. Once again, just my opinion.
wow it’s funny how the writers are willing to give this guy the benefit of the doubt but it was guilty off the back for Berry and Battiste and they had to prove themselves innocent even when there was no evidence that pointed towards them to support the charges against them. but yet this guy’s blood was found at the sceen mixed with the victims blood and he still is being considered innocent but dna does not lie they the informants and so called witnesses do.10 Videos Spanning the Career of Whitney Houston
Vocal legend Whitney Houston died yesterday at the Beverly Hilton. She was 48. Here are ten videos that encompass her life.
© SVEN SIMON/dpa/Corbis
Whitney was born music royalty. Her mother, Cissy, is a Grammy winner in her own right and sang backup for Elvis Presley. Her cousins included Dee Dee and Dionne Warwick and her godmother was Aretha Franklin. So it should be no surprise that Whitney was offered a recording contract at just 14, but her mother wanted her to grow up a little first. So she went into modeling, becoming the first African-American to grace to cover of Seventeen Magazine. She also pursued acting.
First TV Appearance
Whitney starred in a few commercials, but her first real role was in the TV series Gimme a Break in 1984, playing a girl named Rita who is hoping to set up a business with one of the main characters.
First Single
While her first solo single from her debut album peaked at number three, it was the start of an astonishingly successful career. Her next seven singles would chart at #1, a record that not even The Beatles, Mariah Carey, or Michael Jackson matched, and one that has stood for 24 years and counting.
Nelson Mandela Freedom Concert Performance
Whitney was a vocal supporter of the anti-apartheid movement. Even as a teen model she had refused to work with any agency that supported the practice by doing business with South Africa. In 1988 she performed at Nelson Mandela’s 70th Birthday charity concert in London. Whitney’s star power helped bring attention to his plight and that of all South African blacks. After apartheid ended two years later and Mandela was released, Whitney would travel to Johannesburg and meet him, as well as perform for him at a White House banquet in 1994.
Note: Whitney duets with her mom in this video, and it shows you where she got her talent from.
Star Spangled Banner
Whitney was at the top of her game in 1991 when she performed the National Anthem at the Super Bowl. America was embroiled in the first Gulf War, and her note-perfect rendition (okay, she was lip-synching, but who cares) was a fitting and memorable tribute to the men and women in uniform.
Whitney said of her performance: "If you were there, you could feel the intensity. You know, we were in the Gulf War at the time. It was an intense time for a what I felt when I sang that song, and the overwhelming love coming out of the stands was incredible."
"I Will Always Love You"
Well, you knew this would be on here, didn’t you? One of Whitney’s many talents was to take lesser known songs by other artists and make huge hits out of them. Dolly Parton’s "I Will Always Love You" was not only the best example of this, but the defining song of an amazing career. It won every single major award it was nominated for including two Grammys, and was the first record ever to sell one million copies in the first week of its release, and set a (since broken) record of 14 weeks at #1.
Waiting to Exhale Trailer
While Whitney basically played a version of herself in The Bodyguard, three years later she took on a more difficult role, and stood her ground among acting talent like Angela Bassett and Gregory Hines, in 1995’s Waiting to Exhale. She was nominated for an Image Award for her performance, and her theme song "Exhale (Shoop Shoop)" was nominated for four Grammys.
Crack is Whack
While Whitney continued to put out successful albums, her behavior became more erratic and worrying. By the time she sat down for an interview with Diane Sawyer in 2002, rumors were swirling about her drug and alcohol use. She tried to reassure the public that there was no truth to the accusations, but her pronouncement that “crack is whack” just served to highlight her problems.
Sparkle Interview
Whitney did eventually enter rehab and embarked on the ups and unfortunately the downs that are so often a part of recovery. Recently though, it did appear that maybe her life was turning back around for the better. In this Entertainment Tonight interview from just three months ago, she seems happy and healthy while discussing her return to the big screen in a remake of Sparkle. Despite its camp-sounding title, the movie addresses young stars struggling with addiction. Reports indicate the movie will be released later this year as originally planned.
Last Performance
Just two nights before she died Whitney attended a pre-Grammy party where she took the stage for an impromptu performance. She was obviously not well, but the vocal talent that defined her still shone through.
"I Wanna Dance With Somebody (Who Loves Me)"
Hopefully Whitney will be remembered for her voice and her string of record breaking hits rather than her tumultuous life. Smack dab in the middle of her run of seven consecutive number ones was an upbeat dance song that proved she could do more than ballads. Let’s remember her like this, with her crazy 80s hair, high energy, and, as always, her amazing voice.Long before Soaps In Depth reported last week that Prospect Park has placed on hold their plans to relaunch ALL MY CHILDREN on The Online Network, media outlets have been speculating that Susan Lucci (Erica) and the company were having problems reaching an agreement. (As long ago as September, Deadline reported that Lucci had turned down an offer to continue on with Prospect Park.)
For the first time, the Emmy winner is speaking out about her talks with the media company, denying that her failing to reach an agreement with Prospect Park had anything to do with the plans to place AMC on hold. "I want my fans to know the truth. There has been miscommunications as a result of statements in the press that I am one of the reasons that All My Children is not moving forward," she says in an emotional statement posted on her Facebook page. ," she continues, "from working closely with Agnes Nixon to getting to know millions of devoted and wonderful fans."Celebrity Mini-Mes Take Golden Globes Red Carpet by Storm

RFA: Development of National Aquatic Ecosystem Classifications and Reference Conditions (2000)
Research Category: Aquatic Ecosystems
Description:
The specific goals of our proposal are to:
1) Apply an a priori classification system to Great Lakes coastal ecosystems;
2) Quantitatively identify reference sites within classification units using extrinsic, spatial data bases;
3) Define reference biological conditions for classification units;
4) Use biological data to test the efficacy of reference classifications; and
5) Determine whether degraded biological conditions differ from reference conditions in a subset of classification units.
We will combine an a priori classification system, pressure indicators quantifying the degree of anthropogenic impact, and biotic communities in an iterative process to identify the most useful level of classification and reference conditions within the classification system. To initiate this iterative process we will apply a highly specific classification system to Great Lakes coastal ecosystems. The degree of anthropogenic influence on individual ecosystems will be assessed extrinsically from remote sensed data and spatial data bases. Within classification units, reference ecosystems will be identified as those sites with the least amount of anthropogenic influence. We will then define the biotic (macrobenthos and fish) conditions of these reference ecosystems. If we cannot identify unique reference biotic conditions at the most specific level of classification, we will refine our classification system using agglomerative approaches. Because of the potential interdependence of the classification system and the reference conditions identified within the system, this process is not completely subject to quantitative testing. We have, however, introduced quantitative decision points in the process. We will also test whether the biological conditions at degraded sites differ from reference conditions for a subset of our classification units.Expected Results:
The proposed research will identify scientifically defensible protocols for selecting an appropriate classification system and defining reference conditions. These protocols will rely on a combination of readily available, as well as newly collected field data. The methods will be appropriate to large geographic regions with a number of distinct ecosystem types.Publications and Presentations:

Started Aug 13, 2012 | Discussions thread
I’m curious,
There are plenty of choices when it comes to wide angle lenses
Such as the 10-24 Nikkor, 10-20 Sigma and 10-24 Tamron
There are even more choices when it comes to standard zooms, such as the Nikkor 16-85vr Sigma 17-70 etc, etc
So why isn’t there any lenses in-between?
Say 14-60?
I think this kind of rang would be great, and very useable!
Is it possible to make a lens in this range? Is this a problem with physics?
Or is this just a stupid question?
Thanks

Color scheme? Blue / YellowA circular curve is often specified by its radius. A small circle is easily laid out by using the radius. In a mathematical sense, the curvature is the reciprocal of the radius, so that a smaller curvature implies a large radius. A curve of large radius, as for a railway, cannot be laid out by using the radius directly. We will see how the problem of laying out a curve of large radius is solved. In American railway practice, the radius is not normally used for specifying a curve. Instead, a number called the degree of curvature is used. This is indeed a curvature, since a larger value means a smaller radius. The reason for this choice is to facilitate the computations necessary to lay out a curve with surveying instruments, a transit and a 100-ft engineer's tape. It is more convenient to choose round values of the degree of curvature, rather than round values for the radius, for then the transit settings can often be calculated mentally. A curve begins at the P.C., or point of curvature, and extends to the P.T., or point of tangency. The important quantities in a circular curve are illustrated above.
The degree of curvature is customarily defined in the United States as the central angle D subtended by a chord of 100 feet. The reason for the choice of the chord rather than the actual length of circumference is that the chord can be measured easily and directly simply by stretching the tape between its ends. A railway is laid out in lengths called stations of one tape length, or 100 feet. This continues through curves, so that the length is always the length of a series of straight lines that can be directly measured. The difference between this length, and the actual length following the curves, is inconsequential, while the use of the polygonal length simplifies the calculations and measurements greatly.
The relation between the central angle d and the length c of a chord is simply R sin(d/2) = c/2, or R = c/(2 sin d/2). When c = 100, this becomes R = 50/sin D/2, where D is the degree of curvature. Since sin D/2 is approximately D/2, when D is expressed in radians, we have approximately that R = 5729.65/D, or R = 5730/D. Accurate values of R should be calculated using the sine. For example, a 2° curve has R = 2864.93 (accurate), while 5730/D = 2865 ft.
If some other value and length unit are chosen, simply replace 100 by the new value. In the metric system, 20 meters is generally used as the station interval instead of 100 ft, though stations are numbered as multiples of 10 m, and these equations are modified accordingly. With a 20 m chord, R = 1146/D m,or about 3760/D ft. Of course, a given curve has different degrees of curvature in the two systems. There are several methods of defining degree of curvature for metric curves. D may be the central angle for a chord of 10 m instead of 20 m.
The deflection from the tangent for a chord of length c is half the central angle, or δ = d/2. This is a general rule, so additional 100 ft chords just increase the deflection angle by D/2. Therefore, it is very easy to find the deflection angles if a round value is chosen for D, and usually easy to set them off on the instrument. For example, if a curve begins at station 20+34.0 and ends at station 28+77.3, the first subchord is 100 - 34.0 = 66.0 ft to station 21, then 7 100 ft chords, and finally a subchord of 77.3 ft. The deflection angle from the P.C. to the P.T. for a 2° curve is 0.660 + 7 x 1.0 + 0.773 = 8.433 °, or 8° 26'. I have used the approximate relation δ = (c/100)(D/2) to find the deflection angles for the subchords.
The long chord C from P.C. to P.T. is a valuable check, easily determined with modern distance-measuring equipment. It is C = 2R sin (I/2), where I the total central angle. For the example, C = 2(2864.93)sin(8.433) = 840.32 ft. The length of the curve, by stations, is 843.30 ft. This figure can be checked by actual measurements in the field. The actual arc length of the curve is (2864.93)(0.29437) = 843.34 ft. Note that this is the arc length on the centre line; for the rails, use R ± g/2, where g = 4.7083 ft = 56.5 in = 1435 mm for standard gauge.
Before electronic calculators, small-angle approximations and tables of logarithms were used to carry out the computations for curves. Now, things are much easier, and I write the equations in a form suitable for scientific pocket calculators, instead of using the traditional forms that use tabular values and approximations.
A 1° curve has a radius of 5729.65 feet. Curves of 1° or 2° are found on high-speed lines. A 6° curve, about the sharpest that would be generally found on a main line, has a radius of 955.37 feet. On early American railroads, some curves were as sharp as 400 ft radius, or 14.4°. Street railways have even sharper curves. The sharpest curve that can be negotiated by normal diesel locomotives is not less than 250 ft radius, or 23°. It is not difficult to apply spirals, in which the change of curvature is proportional to distance, to the ends of a circular curve. Circular curves are a good first approximation to an alignment.
The centrifugal acceleration in a curve of radius R negotiated at speed v is a = v2/R. If v is in mph, a = 2.1511v2/R = 3.754 x 10-4Dv2 ft/s2, where D is degrees of curvature. This is normal to the gravitational acceleration of 32.16 ft/s2, and the total acceleration is the vector sum of these. For comfort, a maximum ratio of a to g may be taken as 0.1 (tan-1 5.71°). The overturning speed depends on the height of the centre of gravity, and occurs when a line drawn from the centre of gravity parallel to the resultant acceleration passes through one rail. The height of the centre of gravity of American railway equipment is 10 ft or less. Taking 10 ft as the height of the centre of gravity, a/g = 0.2354 (tan-1 13/25°). Therefore, the overturning speed vo can be estimated by Dvo2 = 20,000 and the comfort speed vc by Dvc2 = 8500.
A curve may be superelevated by an amount s so that the resultant acceleration is more normal to the track. Exact compensation occurs only for one speed, of course. This angle of bank is given by tan θ = a/g = 1.167 x 10-5Dv2, and sin θ = s/gauge. Consider a 2° curve. For v = 60 mph, tan θ = 0.08404, sin θ = 0.08375 and s = 4.73 in. If the speed is greater than this, there will be an unbalanced acceleration, which will have a ratio of a/g of 0.1 at a speed v' given by 0.1 = 1.167 x 10-5D(v'2 - v2), or v' = 89 mph. The overturning speed on this curve is given by (0.2354 + 0.08404) = (1.167 x10-5)Dv2, or v = 117 mph. Note that a large superelevation will cause the flanges of a slow-moving train to grind the lower rail. Superelevation is generally limited to 6 to 8 in maximum.

HOMEOWNERS CAN BE SUBJECT TO SOCIAL HOST LIABILITY LAWS WHEN SERVING LIQUOR
ALBANY, N.Y., Dec. 20, 2011 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- The holiday season means party time for many people. But hosts who serve alcohol should take steps to limit their liquor liability and make sure they have the proper insurance, according to the New York Insurance Association, Inc. (NYIA). including New York have them on the books. Most of these laws also offer an injured person, such as the victim of a drunk driver, a method to sue the person who served the alcohol. There are circumstances under these laws where criminal charges may also apply. And even if the Dram Shop Act does not apply, a host can still be civilly liable under ordinary negligence standards.
"Because you can be held legally responsible for your guests' actions after they leave your party, hosts need to be particularly careful," said Ellen Melchionni, president of the NYIA. "While a social host is not liable for injuries sustained by.

Improving the environment is top on the government's list of priorities, but enforcement might still be an issue
Will the new MEP's added muscle really cut pollution? What's your experience? Let us know through ICIS connect
John Richardson/Singapore
THE OPTIMISTS would have you believe that a wind of change is blowing through China's chemical industry - and one that is not necessarily carrying a tell-tale aromatic or sulfur smell.
The decision to upgrade the State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA) to full ministry status, which was made in March, has raised the prospect of much more stringent enforcement of existing environmental legislation through proper funding.
New laws are also expected to emerge, making the business of chemicals more costly in China and potentially even leading to a level playing field. Foreign investors have long played by international rules while their local competitors have flouted local laws to keep costs down.
But the pessimists will, as always, point out the difficulty in enforcing legislation in a country that is huge in size and huge in corruption.
FAR MORE POWERFUL
"The old SEPA - renamed the Ministry of Environmental Protection (MEP) - has finally got the authority to force companies to stop production before discussions are held over alleged pollution problems," says a Beijing-based chemical consultant. "Previously, the companies were free to carry on pumping untreated water into rivers or high levels of toxins into the air while meetings about meetings took place. Sometimes it could take years to get an abatement order."
The MEP is likely to be given more staff and more funding. It is also expected to take over a local design institute, enabling the setting up of a team of engineers who would more effectively monitor pollution. Another important legislative shift, announced by the National People's Congress at the same time as the MEP was formed, is a new pollution law, which, for the first time, requires companies to help meet the cost of pollution.
The law - which comes into force on June 1 - stipulates that an enterprise "will be responsible for 30% of the direct economic losses resulting from any serious water pollution. Incidents of medium water pollution will result in a 20% penalty." The bosses of companies found to be directly responsible for causing severe water pollution could also face a fine up to half of their previous year's income.
It is also now mandatory for companies to canvass local opinion before pursuing a project and to include the views of residents in an environmental impact assessment report. However, the public still has no right to call for a public inquiry and halt building work.
RESTRUCTURING OF THE DIRTY, OLD PRODUCERS
Smaller, older chemical plants could be forced to close, particularly those using outdated technologies in, for example, the chlor-alkali and sulfuric acid sectors, the consultant adds. But this is where one of the old and well-worn doubts is raised by the pessimists and skeptics.
"Some of the small and outdated chemical plants are crucial to employment in the less developed areas of China. Political influence may be used to keep these facilities operating," says one of the skeptics - an environmental activist.
"You could see consolidation take place where midsized chemical companies buy up some of the older assets and keep them running in remote rural areas. State-of-the-art plants will only be operated in Eastern and Southern China - where the pressure on jobs is not as great."
But more evidence of tougher day-to-day conditions for chemical companies emerged at the China Petrochemical Summit. The conference, which took place in Beijing in March, was a joint venture between ICIS and CBI China. "The new ministry is very powerful and very busy. It has stopped issuing licenses for new chemicals production," said one delegate.
"Some of the companies holding licenses are trying to sell them because they are having difficulties with effluent control." Companies would in the past only operate wastewater treatment facilities when they knew a SEPA official was about to visit, the delegate added. But now meters are being installed that enable MEP employees to monitor whether wastewater is being treated continuously.
SOURCING OF CHEMICALS GETS HARDER
The delegates also reported that sourcing chemical intermediates from China was becoming a great deal more difficult as a result of the environmental clampdown.
"I was at a recent chemicals exhibition where only catalogs were available," said a purchasing manager with an international producer. "No products or prices were on offer because intermediate chemical manufacturers are facing a great deal of uncertainty. They are unwilling to commit to a particular product or a price because they are not sure whether production licenses will be granted."
The delegates also made the important point that the environmental crackdown has firm backing from the central government because of widespread concern over rising pollution levels. One unofficial estimate was that 70% of the 40,000 public protests that took place in China last year were the result of environmental problems.
But even if conditions on the ground are getting harder, and costs are going up as companies are forced to follow legislation, stories still persist of corruption getting in the way of universal, even-handed enforcement. "Officials with the environment agencies can be bribed. I've also heard stories of some firms posting their men down the road to watch out for officials so they can raise the alarm and get production stopped," said a trader who also attended the conference.
LACKING EXPERTISE AND MANPOWER
Another concern is that Chinese companies lack the training to operate pollution monitoring and pollution control equipment. "We have seen the number of enquiries about our equipment increase, so we recently set up a China office," says an executive with a company that supplies hazardous-chemicals early-warning systems.
"We have achieved quite a few sales but I am not entirely confident that the companies we sold to will operate the equipment on a continuous basis. They lack enough sufficiently experienced people." A further problem is that firefighters often lack experience in how to handle chemical accidents.
During an incident in one chemical park a fire crew drove towards a minor fire without realizing that their vehicle was highly flammable, adds the executive. He says that if you are lucky enough to find a good fire crew they have a habit of frequent job-hopping, as is the case in every sought-after profession in China.
But still, 1,934 chemical plants have been closed down in Jiangsu province alone as a result of the environmental clampdown, 1,197 of which were on the shores of the heavily polluted Taihu Lake. Higher standards have also been recently set for energy consumption in the synthetic ammonia, sodium hydroxide, calcium carbide and yellow phosphorous industries.
It's not only the old SEPA that's been upgraded and given more powers. Local authorities have also been given more muscle to tackle highly polluting industries. Perhaps, though, the strongest argument of all in support of those who say that China means business on the environment is that policy is being driven from the top.
"Because the environment is right at the top of Beijing's to-do list, local government officials and company executives have to take heed if they want to keep their jobs," says Arthur Kroeber, managing director of Dragonomics, a Hong Kong-based research service that focuses on the Chinese economy.
"The idea that central government has no control over local governments and companies is one of the commonest and silliest one-liners about China."

About Corky
The Early Years! When Corky was but a wee round-headed kid!
Let's start out with some insight as to why I am here today doing this. It's not so much that I've done anything profound or out of the ordinary, it's just that I've done alot of things and I'm trying to remember some of the blur! It's been quite a ride!
I grew up on the "West Side" of South Bend, Indiana. This was the BAD side of town! The mixture of nationalities and races was a good experience but it did have it's tension! People seemed to shy away from anything and/or anyone that was not what they were used to seeing. Pretty much the way it is today! There were people from Poland, Belgium, Hungary, Italy, Armenia, France, Eastern Asia, Western Asia, Mexico, America (Native Indians of all sorts), etc. Quite the melting pot! There was also skins of Black, Red, White, Yellow and on...!
As kids, we all just sort of played and mixed together not even noticing anymore than the obvious! I just sort of cruised through the days playing ball and looking at girls eating ice cream and going to the movies and just being a kid! In the news I can remember the "Iron Curtain" and the "Wall" that divided Berlin. Sputnik was soaring over head and people debated the possibility of a man landing on the moon.
I grew up in a home that was full of music from many genres. Since It was the 1950's, and having a sister, Fran, eight years my senior, the first wave of Rock and Roll was ever so present! I heard Elvis (of course; and I even have a photo of me at his house on Audubon St.), and Chuck Berry and Fabian and Dion and on and on! All of the "American Bandstand" staple groups and singers were heard wafting through the air from my sisters corner! She had fan clubs for Elvis and Ricky Nelson and I can't remember who all and she'd have dance parties in our garage with her girlfriends and that was nice! I rather enjoyed the attention I got from all those bobby sockers! I think that may have something to do with why I choose to play music! Like Rock's apostles John and Paul said," That's a good job"!
In my Dad's corner came the sounds of Rockabilly and Country! Not todays Country but the stuff from Bob Wills and Eddy Arnold! Ernest Tubb, Buck Owens, Marty Robbins, those were some of the artists that I was exposed to! Of course, the entire "Hee Haw" bunch! The man I remember most of all, and one that was to reenter my life over and over again through The Beatles and Eric Clapton, was Carl Perkins! His style and his songs played a very important part in shaping country music and in retrospect, my own playing and feel! I can still hear my Dad say,"Man, listen to that picking"!
My Mom was much more of a contemporary and Gospel music lover! The Blackwood Brothers and the Stamps Quartet are two that come to mind! I've got to mention Bing Crosby and (last but not least) Lawrence Welk as Larry's "Champagne Lady" Alice Lon went to school with me Mum and we used to visit her quite often on our many trips to Texas! Being that we went to church several times a week, I got involved with the choir and trumpet there! I got my "musical training" from that institution! I actually took my first guitar lessons from a fellow in the church! I can remember some "All Night Singings" that seemed to take all night!
Little did I know, all of this music came basically from the same place! How about that!
I played the trumpet for three years with the church, school bands and simply because I thought it was just an amazing instrument! To me, Al Hirt was the most! "Flight Of The Bumblebee" hit me where I lived! My Dad would rib me that trumpets weren't cool and that I should play the guitar! This is where I got my formal music education as far as reading and writing music. Scales and all that!
Then came, "THE BEATLES"!!!
The whole "British Invasion" had a big influence on me, but "The Beatles" were the most influential! I think I was in the 7th grade. I started my first band, "THE RAMRODS", with my friend Kenneth Kwieran on drums. It was just the two of us and we played our first gig playing along with records. 45's at that! We knew that wouldn't cut it so we added a second guitar by the name of Mike Horvath and bassist Randy Bruenlin. Although my Dad wanted me to play the guitar, he wouldn't allow me to take his guitar and amplifier out of the house to practice. I would literally run the six blocks home after school and sneak his gear out and down the alley to Ken's house so we could rehearse! One day I got my Dad's stuff back home just as he was getting home from work and I sighed a heavy sigh! But guess what kids? I didn't realize that since it was snowing he might find out because of the wetness on the amp! That's right, BUSTED!! It seemed as if that had to have happened because we sort of worked it out and he allowed me to use his things from then until I got my own gear. I think for Christmas I got six months of lessons and a guitar and a rockin' I went! I could rehearse anytime! And I did!
I'll take the time now to tell you that I took my first guitar lessons from John Rayburn at the Apostolic Temple and then went to Gene Klosinski's Music Studios in South Bend's notorious "west side"! Kenny Denny was my instructor (several years later we played in bands together) then moved over to Danny Gates and continued lessons from him! From there I got alot of "on the job training"! I did, later, meet and become friends with Wil Sharpe from the band ATLANTIS (later called ETHOS with two albums on Capital Records) out of Fort Wayne, In. He showed me some nice and informative things on the guitar and as I watched him work I picked up more stuff that I still use today! Thanks to all!
Now, back to the story! The Ramrods worked the teen dances and ice cream socials and even some American Legions and V.F.W clubs in the Michiana area for a couple of years. When we played our first gig for money at the Epworth Memorial Church we became "professionals". We taped a television show, "ON THE GO WITH MIKE AND JOE", for WSBT-TV one evening and stayed up all night to watch it at 7:00 AM. When the announcer got to us he said "and here they are, the Roughriders"! WRONG NAME PAL! What a blow to our newly found egos! We also did a spot on the "D.D.DONOVAN SHOW" on WSJV-TV as my Aunt Penny was the sidekick "Tagalong"
As we graduated from grade school to high school things seemed to happen to pull us apart and personnel changes occurred that brought Doug Hoffman in on the bass and Mike Connelly to the drums. We even added Ron Rhoades to play keyboards! He was later to be replaced by Dick Jahnke!
Somehow I got connected to Homer Fitterling who would always find me a place to perform at the St. Joseph County Fair! We won some talent shows, and lost some, but we played around for a couple more years until Mike Connelly graduated H.S. and went to college. I tried to keep the Ramrods together with a crew of people that I don't even remember right now, but the quality of the music was never the same! That's when I got a call from the
"KNIGHTRAIDERS"!
E
nter "THE KNIGHTRAIDERS"
The Knightraiders were am established band in the Michiana area that played every weekend and covered Northern Indiana, Southern Michigan and even Eastern Illinois! Playing Top 40 hits as well as Soul and music from the British Invasion, The Knightraiders seemed a perfect vehicle for the likes of a young Corky! They boasted good musical abilities and were very good in the vocal department using 5 out of 6 of the members on lead! They were: Corky, Joe Talboom, Randy Stahl, Lee Howerton, Jim Gentry and Mike Guljas! We rehearsed regularly and strived to be a good, competent band! My last two years of high school I kept busy learning my craft and earned a paycheck at the same time!
THE Summer of Love "67"
By the summer of 1967, the Knightraiders were older and more savvy! As Joe Talboom's Aunt lived in London, we were exposed to magazines and records of the times! I remember seeing Jeff Beck on the cover of a Yardbirds album with a fringe swede jacket and thinking "that's cool"! We got shirts and trousers that were not even seen in this area! we were so HIP!
The band started playing more cerebral music! PSYCHEDELIA had caught us up and we got into the Jimi Hendrix, The Doors and The Vanilla Fudge! The summer of '68' found us traveling on a tour of Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Illinois for the entire summer! Clad in all the hip clothes we worked until the beginning of the school year! That is my Senior year! 1969! I remember walking into school the first day and immediately got cuffed and sent to the office due to the fact that my hair was too long and my clothes didn't conform to school code! Sent home the first half hour of the year! It all seemed so normal to me!
Since my band mates came from different areas of town than I, I pretty much lost contact with my own classmates from the west side of South Bend and once I graduated I never looked back!
Life had its way with me, as it usually does, and I found myself married to Karen (Labis) and my daughter Bridget was born. Being mere teenagers, divorce soon followed! The band played on only to find that Lee and Randy soon left the group and we carried on with four!
Renamed, "The Amusement Company", we really got into the psychedelic times! Our music became harder and louder and we "kicked arse"! This lineup played even larger halls and traveled more with the addition of a 55 passenger bus! We were happening! As time went on, Mike Guljas had to leave to go to college and was replaced by Vince Rizzo! We lost a bit of our edge after Mike left and had to make more changes to get back to a level of music to which we were accustomed! A brainstorm occurred! Let's join forces with the band "The Mystic Love" and that way we'd have horns and lots of vocals!
So, "OCTOPUSS" was born!
Octopuss was an eight piece band! Joe, Jimmy, and myself with our new trumpet player Wayne Kurtz plus Mike Holloway on bass, Gary Smith on guitar and vocals, Bob Blake on piano and trumpet and Bill(Sluggo)Hyde on guitar, sax and flute! What a band! What a full sound! What alot of mouths to feed! It didn't take long before we found out that eight ways is a big split of the monies and we starved ourselves right out of business! Octopuss was rearranged by the draft and other things, but carried on in different forms for some time as a strictly original band! Some with the GURU! I wasn't involved too much!
"ZECHARIAH"
"Zechariah" was a shot in the arm for me! Around 1970, after I was divorced and remarried (!?!?), I would get calls from various club owners needing a band like "TONIGHT" so I'd call friends and ask if they'd like to play and just show up at gigs cold! No rehearsal, no song list and just play! Whatever songs we could pull out of the air we would play! It was fun and a great learning experience! I did a few gigs with my guitar teachers band. It was different for me as it was more of a "supper club" sort of thing! Cheat sheets and ad lib! I don't remember the name of the band but it was made up of Danny Gates, Kenny Denny, Janice Hughes and Ron Fewik! They were good! I was green!
After a while I wanted to get into a more serious situation! I heard where my friend Randy Berkel's band was looking for a guitar player! So I called him to ask if I could audition for the position and he said, "Let's just start a new group" and we did!
That's when Zechariah was formed! At first we were three! Randy (drums), myself (guitar) and Kenny Denny (bass)! We found this to be limited in material so we added a keyboard player! Jim Schrop began to play with us and that rounded out the lineup for quite a while! We did 20 weeks at the "111" club and moved over to "Poor Squatsos" for who knows how long! During this time we decided that we wanted to go on the road! Well, this didn't work with Kenny as he had a family and we couldn't make enough to support that situation! So he had to leave! That's when we brought in Dale Voitel on bass!
We landed the "house band" gig at "Shula's Nightclub"! That was a pretty cool gig! We would be the warm up band for road bands and we did five 20 minute sets an night! Six nights a week! Cushy Cushy Cushy! Party Party Party!
One band was called "MS FUNK". I think they were a six piece group and one of the players was Tommy Shaw! He later joined the band "Styx" and we all know that story! Real nice fellow and what a talent!
Another group was "High Voltage". There lineup had a female singer that was awesome! She later changed her name to "Chaka Khan". I'll have to research some facts because some of the other players went on to do some musical stuff too!
Well, I've got to break for now but I will be back with more! Stay Tuned!
"ZECHARIA" Goes to Washington
One of the groups that came into Shula's was called "BLITZ"! They were from Washington D.C. and we became fast friends with them! As it turned out, they invited me/us to come out to the BIG CITY! So, we did! I sold almost everything I had (furniture, records, autos, even the pictures off the walls) and took then wife, Karla, my two dogs and whatever clothes and other bare essentials that would fit in a Chevy van and left South Bend, NEVER TO RETURN! Of course, there was the band! Now made up of myself, Jimmy Gentry, Randy Berkel, Bob Blake and Ron Rutkowski! We were on our way to set the world ablaze!
During the few weeks before we took off, we rehearsed hard to get ready for our trek! We decided to do some more progressive music, i.e., Yes, Genesis, Flock, etc. Songs we were proud to play because they were rather "artsy" for the time (early 70's)! We did one gig at the "ELECTRIC CIRCUS" in Elkhart, IN and split! We didn't even wait for the reviews! I did later hear that we were well thought of but.....We were gone to the CITY! People just sort of said "Hey, what happened to Zechariah"?
We got to Washington D.C. expecting to have eleven weeks of work and found that we had none! That's right readers, zero, zilch, none, as in NO WORK! Ten people in our entourage and no work! We stayed at the home of one of the members of Blitz. It was a five bedroom tri-level on a cul-de-sac with trees and a lawn and all of the bedrooms were already occupied! So we slept on sofas and floors and vans and that lawn under those trees! One night we went to sleep only to be awakened with shotguns in our faces! It was the police! They knew who we were, and that whatever business they were there for, we had nothing to do with! Still, "What A Drag"!
We finally got our first gig but had to travel to Ocean City, Maryland! The Atlantic Ocean! The Boardwalk! Paradise! It was quite expensive and took the rest of our money but we had a great time taking in the culture of "beach living!" It was an eye opener for a long haired kid from Indiana! Sun, sand and East coast girls! We opened a show for the artist Catfish Hodge and went over well with the audience as well as the promoters! I talked with the "promo men" about continuing a tour with Catfish but passed on it due to finances and the fact that I didn't know what I was doing! Things might have been a lot different had I accepted this offer but live and learn!
Meanwhile, back in Washington, we got a weekly gig at a club called "The Act IV". It was every Monday night and was in the area known as "Georgetown"! This was the "hip" part of town where everybody was with the In-crowd! Yeah, right where they filmed "The Exorcist"! Here we got to know some of the local groups and players from Washington that were more than the average guitar slingers! One group called "Boa" were heading for a record contract and were very good players and singers! They recorded and album of really nice original songs that landed them in a debt that made them sell all of there equipment to try and pay back the record company! Lesson one in what to watch out for! We ended up buying their lighting system and never heard from them again! Well, now you could hear us and see us!
We started to get regular work in and around Washington and we got real good and tight as a band! We also got to start eating better! One of our favorite meals was "Corky's Fried Chicken!" That made us all feel better! It was amazing how much better we all felt and worked when we had something good in our bellies!
I got connected with a booking agency called DOMESTIC SOUNDS in Falls Church, VA around this time and they started to get us a few bookings! They also told me that as good of a band that we had we would still only get the "scraps" of the bookings unless we started to learn and play "Top 40" music! So I bought a half dozen tunes and we learned them! Shazam, we started to work steady! Every weekend! We even had to play two, and once, three gigs in the same day! Things were going well, so we thought, when drummer Randy Berkel had to leave the group due to personal and financial reasons! It was a sad day when he had to leave but we were determined to trudge on! We auditioned and listened to several drummers but couldn't find what we needed! We'd work with this one and that one just to keep playing but things just weren't the same! We did, finally, pick one Jack Nash who was another South Bend player and we trudged on!
It was also about this time that we started to open for some "National Acts" in concert situations and with personnel changes going on, we weren't prepared with much "original" music! I've always felt that if we would have been ready with some of our own material our paths would have gone in a different direction! I'll never forget the first time I played a real concert with a professional sound system and lights and all! We opened with the song "The Story In Your Eyes" by the Moody Blues! The sound was so big on stage and the energy was very high and we sounded so powerful and strong! I stepped up to the microphone to sing and this huge blast of my own voice hit my ears and it startled me to the point that I almost forgot to keep singing! I wasn't accustomed to "stage monitors"! I mean to say it was wonderful and it actually made me have more confidence and we just continued to "kick out the jams" the rest of the show! What a great feeling! What a Rush! What a good job! That was opening for the band "Looking Glass"! Very nice dudes and I found out real fast that that was unusual for the "headliner" band to be nice!
The booking agency called one day to say they had a gig every Wednesday night at a club called Pier 9. We loaded up and went to play and the first thing that Bob Blake saw when he walked in was two guys kissing! Welcome to the gay community, culture shock for five lads from the Midwest! Well, we played and went over very well with the gay community and had another steady gig! Two nights every week we knew we had work!
From meeting people there we got to know others from the "hip" section of Georgetown and got our foot in the door of several Georgetown clubs! There was the "Crazy Horse" with the stage behind the bar, the "M Club" home of a band called Daddy Warbucks (later to be Angel of Casablanca Label). Angel were supposed to be the opposite of Kiss all in white and everything pristine), the "Bayou" (where I first saw Kiss as they were putting their act together!)
People came and went during this period and the name of the band changed to "Squeeze"! Enter Michael James, drummer extraordinare and all around good friend! Micheal, now residing in Burbank, California and working for Paul Reiser as his assistant, Tom McCarthy, last known working for a record company, and Tim Ford, just play the white keys, plus Jimmy and Corky was the new line up!
We became a regular mainstay in the "Georgetown scene"! You could find us at the "M Club" quite often, playing Monday through Saturday! On Wednesday nights the club would put out a spread of food for the students of Gauludette College! This is a huge college for the deaf! These students would come in and chow down and boogie the night away! This lead to our playing at their school! At first it seemed absurd, but as we learned, these students ALL took music appreciation and they turned out to be one of our best audiences! They kept telling us to "turn it up"! They would feel the vibrations of the music and really let loose! Another bit of education for this green kid from Indiana! I'll never forget them and the wonderful times I had performing for them! Thanks kids! For those of you who can dig this, I used a 200 watt Marshall with a 55 watt Fender Bassman as a preamp! That was LOUD!
I remember another gig at Fairfax High School! It seems that their school had won some sort of an award for scholastic achievement and as a reward they hired us to play! We set up early in the morning in th auditorium and a special assembly was called! As the kids came in there was a giant movie screen hanging at the front of the stage where they proceeded to show a football reel! After about ten minutes of this we clicked off our first song and the screen was rolled up and the whole place just roared! The students were stunned beyond their senses and started to dance and sing and had a wonderful time! Afterwards they fed us (again, we had breakfast too) and we actually signed autographs and went on as we were real STARS! It was pretty cool! I actually ran into people later in my career that were there and they still talked about that happening!
Over the next couple of years the band just kept plugging away and members came and went, and we eventually ended up with the line up of myself, Michael, Jimmy, Timmy, and Ken Gillenwater on bass! We worked under the name Squeeze for some time until we met and worked under the management of Bill "Ziggy" Zeigman who took the band and put us in suits and other matching uniform type outfits and groomed us as the band "Buster Brown"! This is when things really started to take off and we got an education from Zig that we would probably never have gotten had he not come along!
I was reminded this past weekend, by a friend, of a time in College Park, Maryland, when we started the stage curtains on fire! It wasn't a real bad fire but all the same it could have been a horrible experience! George Thorogood was there but I don't remember what part he had in starting the fire! He was playing around the corner and we would go see him on our breaks and he would come see us on his breaks! As I remember more I'll let you know!
Next time, How Mike lost his shoes!
I'm back! just a few words on Mike Whelan and his shoes! As I recall it.......we were working in Columbia, South Carolina at the "Down Under" and it was the end of a three week stay! Now in S.C. they have laws that clubs can't be open past midnight on Saturday nights! So.....we had to start at 6:00 pm. and play until midnight! Needless to say, we were bushed but had to tear down the gear and drive back to Washington D.C. that night to be at our next club on Monday night! Well Mike had come down to "boogie" with us and he helped us tear down and load up the truck. In those days (70's) the shoe styles were platform soles and big thick heels. Not conducive to walking up steps and into trucks so he took his shoes off! Well while we were loading the truck.......someone stole his shoes! Right there on the street! He had to drive back to Washington barefoot! remember, "no shoes, no service"! we had to go in and do his business for him! It was a "trip" home!
We travelled up and down Rt. 95 from Dover, Del. to Columbus, Ga. for a few years and it got rather tedious and boring! On the road for weeks and come home long enough to mow lawns and fix windows and such....then "On The Road Again"! Eventually, I grew tired of it and chucked it all only to return to South Bend, Indiana! (I'll NEVER go back to South Bend" I once said! My only regret was leaving Michael James behind as he didn't want to leave the city! And so it goes!
Welcome back to the land of taxes! (circa 1980)
I brought with me Jimmy Gentry, Ken Gillen, Cindy Joes (nee Davis) and Tom Biller. We joined up with Randy Berkel on drums and set forth to have a rockin' band! We named it "BUSTER"!
BUSTER made a change early as it just wasn't working for Randy.....so he left and was replaced by Paul Risler.....a good solid drummer!
Thinking we would take the area by storm turmed out to be an eye opener and I found out that...at the time.....clubowner's were quite loyal to the bands that were working for them and it took a while for us to break into the circuit!
We landed a gig at "Mario's", just north of the Michigan State Line, and used it as a showcase. Inviting several clubowner's to see and hear the band! It worked! Bob Cole and J.W. Toad stopped in and booked the band into the "Cole Mine" in Walkerton, In. and J.W. Toads in South Bend, In. This was to be the catalyst of getting Buster off the ground! The word got around and we were booking every week! At the time it was Wednesday, Friday & Saturday! Some places even Thursday! We played all around the Michiana area for many years playing to mostly packed rooms! Life was good and we rocked and partied hardy! Some of the rooms we played.....Pardner's Night Club, Shula's, J.W. Toad's, The Cole Mine, Red Door Lounge, The Headquarter's, 2nd Edition, The Turning Point, Mario's and many more that I will add as my memory wakes up!
Over a period of around 5 years, BUSTER made a handful of personel changes! Tommy Basano and Jerry Gushwa came in on drums; Oliver (?), Jon Lee, Danny (?) and Dana Bare played keyboards; Tom Biller, Ben Bowman and Cindy (Davis) Jones handled the soundboard! We were best known for artist such as The Beatles, Pink Floyd, ELO, Steely Dan, The Cars, Bob Seger....oh the list goes on!
In 1984, while in the middle of a week long gig in Fort Wayne, In, we experience the worst! A fire occured in the middle of the night destroying thousands of dollars of equipment! What a nightmare it was! We fixed and cleaned and borrowed a scant amount of equipment to get us through our next engagements......trying to rebuild what was lost! For two years we tried to put the circus back together! Finally, in 1985, we threw in the towel! It was a sad breakup but we just couldn't recoup!
It was a very good band and it is nice that BUSTER is remembered still today by many people that come up and say nice things about the era! Thank you folks for making it possible! Our final gig was Christmas week 1985! New Year's Eve, I was onstage with a new group........"CORCHESTRA" was born!
"CORCHESTRA"
was put together at "Brother's Night Club" in Bremen, In. as the house band! Playing for Art and Al Bustamante was great while it lasted! It was a short lived gig due to some "out of control" circumstance!
The band was Corky, Kenny Denny, Dana Bare and Cory Kiser! It was a fun time and we played tunes for dancing and just having fun! Kenny was replaced by Paul Stokes who added and edge that was missing! We were at "Brothers" for about 6 months when, sadly, the bar had to close! So, we took it on the road.......to "BROTHERS II" in Plymouth, In. as well as many other venues in the surrounding area! South Bend, Mishawaka, Elkhart, Goshen, LaPorte, Walkerton Rochester and so forth! About this time Cory was replaced with Art Bustamante! The beat was stong and we carried on!
At one point, Dana discovered he had a heart problem and had to leave the band! We added Ron Warner on guitar and I had to take over some of the keyboard work! Did I really play with mittens on? It probably sounded like it at times!
As time passed, Paul was replaced by Rick Mays and Ron was replaced by Frank Hunter! The beat went on!
As I was owner (by proxy) of the BREMEN HOTEL in Bremen, In. and caring for the 10 acre farm, I didn't have time to put into a band and gave my notice to the others! They could have replaced me and carried on, but they chose to pack it in!
The first Friday night that I didn't have to play I remember standing out in the fields thinking "I don't have to be anywhere! This is wonderful"! Life was quite different for a while! Living with Marla and her children was a change for me! I raised cows and goats and chickens as well as 120 tomato plants! I had no idea how many tomatoes that would yield! I was no farmer!
About 4 months later, standing in the same field, I was thinking "I should be somewhere else" and that is when I decided to put together a small trio to play now and then! I had that itch! Small clubs with small equipment and little production......Yeah!
"Mother Goose Band" was born with myself, Rick Mayes and Paul Riser! We played one gig in North Liberty, In. Cold! No rehearsals and it was horrible! That was the end of that lineup! I recruited Garry Daniels (drums) and Ben Bowman (bass) and started to rehearse in the loft of my barn! Again, we were terrible!
We rehearsed for several weeks and it actually began to come together some and we started thinking about taking it out to the bars! I booked us into a club in North Webster, In. one month away! We rehearsed a set a week to get it together! Three weeks, three sets! Cool! On our fourth week, Sam, the club owner called and said his band didn't show and would we be able to play that night! Well, we gathered our equipment and off we went to debut the "Mother Goose Band"
The first three sets were fine only we had to do a fourth and....well......it all fell apart! It is quite funny in retrospect! The people were buzzed and never knew a thing! Good old alcohol!
So we carried on and got our chops together and started playing other locations. We began to play every weekend and got to be pretty good! We could hold our own! Even in downtown "South Bend"! The BIG city! Whoa!
People would come up to me and say, "we know you but we didn't know who the Mother Goose Band was"! So.......I changed the name of the band to "Corky and the MGB" and we played and played!
An unexpected turn came to pass and I'll just say a personel change occured and the lineup changed to Dennis Clemens (bass) and Joe (drums) from the band "Northside Station"! We would play my gigs as Corky and the MGB and their gigs as "Northside Station" as well! This was a short lived situation! I had to put an end to it!
Recruiting again! This time, Garry came back to drum and an old friend Kelly Guin (bass)! Kelly had just returned from playing with Davey Jones of "The Monkees" and wanted to do something small and quaint! It was good for us all and off we went a-rockin'! Actually.......country was making it's mark and we had to pick up some of those diddy's to vie for a spot in most venues! It was comical to my Rock and Roll friends!
The ball started rolling and we were playing every weekend, however, another chance in the lineup occurred! Garry was replaced with Art Bustamante and the beat went on! This change made the rhythm section strong and powerful! Phones were ringing and busy got busier! Too good to be true............Yes, another change!
As it turned out, we were playing too much for Kelly and he had to leave the group! At this time a first happened to me! Kelly had a replacement! Next up......."Dr. Dave" enters the line up!
Welcome aboard David!
David started playing and it was such a smooth transition! The ball kept rollin' along! Hard to believe that was 17 years ago! We had a great run and played nearly every weekend as well as many Sundays ....and even some Thursdays!
David had a high range so he got stuck with all of the "bitch" parts! I found him a song by "The Police" to sing the lead to (Every Breath You Take) and he had such fun that he asked me to find him another! No problem! He began singing leads to songs and has turned out to be a fine singer!
We played and played and the years went by.......and we are still playing!
Well De De......I've addeed a little but as always......I have to run!
Hi kids!!!!!!! It's now 9/4/2010 and all I can say is that I'll be back soon to tell you more!

It’s still the boots and the spurs and the cowboy hats, but the face of rodeo is starting to look a little more diverse. In a sport where boys and men have long ruled the roost, the girls are kicking up dust, and they’re doing it with style.
The Cave Creek Pro Rodeo, a 35-year Arizona tradition and the highlight of Cave Creek Fiesta Days, is coming to town March 22 – 24. It is one of the best-attended and most anticipated events in the area, and behind its success are some dedicated folks.
While other rodeos are flailing and failing, the blood, sweat and tears of the Cave Creek Pro Rodeo Committee are keeping ours going strong. Nothing has changed on the outside; the Cave Creek Pro Rodeo is still an exciting event full of thrills and spills and crowd-pleasing excitement. There are a lot of scuffed up boots behind the scenes, but these days, many of them have manicured toes inside.
The women behind Cave Creek Pro Rodeo are a force to be reckoned with. Gritty and pretty president of the board Traci Casale heads up the events, and has been the glue that has held the rodeo together, even after devastating cold weather, followed by theft of every piece of equipment the rodeo owned nearly caused it to fold in 2011. The one-two punch came at a time when the future of small rodeos nationwide was starting to look bleak.
“I said to everybody, ‘Do you want to go home, or do you want to put your boots on and go to work?’” Casale said, her black studded custom JW Brooks hat shading her dark eyes from the setting sun as she relaxed in the back of a pickup truck.
Casale is tiny, but so is a stick of dynamite.
“We all put our boots on and worked hard to make it happen, and everyone said that 2012 was the best success we’ve ever had out there,” she continued with pride.
The other seven women who found time to meet at the arena nodded in agreement. Each one has spent hours and hours rounding up sponsors, planning event schedules, maintaining and upgrading facilities and so many more responsibilities, all while juggling families, careers and other sometimes overlooked things like sleeping and eating regularly.
They’re busy gals, but they all say they’re happy to be a part of the rodeo lifestyle.
“There are a lot of opportunities for women to use their strengths and apply them to rodeo,” said Casale. “Women tend to be better multi-taskers and that alone is a huge benefit in producing any major event. Women also tend to be quite giving, and when you are volunteering all your time to a cause or to an organization, generosity is invaluable. We all have to be generous with our time and we all have to wear many hats to make this rodeo successful.”
“We all have the same goals of being part of this community and preserving our Western heritage,” said Robbie Hall, who heads up the Fiesta Days Parade that will wind its way through Cave Creek March 23. Over 4,000 people lined the streets for last year’s parade, and a similar crowd is expected this year.
“A huge part of our goals, too, is bringing more youth and families into this sport,” Hall added. “There isn’t much out there for our youth, and rodeo is a healthy family thing that everyone can enjoy together.”
Tina Hayden, who is in charge of the mutton bustin’ event for children four to seven years old, is on it. Last year, she herded 95 youngsters for the popular event. Today’s mutton busters are tomorrow’s bronc riders, so she and the volunteers and sponsors who work with her are cultivating the future of rodeo … and she does it with a smile. “I’m a mom, so it’s nothing new for me,” she said modestly.
Each of the women, Casale, Hall, Hayden, Cathy Nielsen, Yolanda Kruger, Amanda Barlow, Beth Cornell, and Casale’s sister Teri and other volunteers have all dug in their heels and worked hard to make the rodeo – and the golf tournament, parade, dances, mutton bustin’, and all of the Cave Creek Fiesta Days celebration happen, and rodeo folks around the country are starting to take notice. At the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA) Convention this year, they were one of the only constituencies made up nearly entirely of women.
“We got noticed,” said Hall with a laugh. The others agreed.
But this is no beauty pageant. These girls are more than lipstick and hairspray. They get down and dirty and do their time to make it happen.
Amanda Barlow, the youngest of the group, was the reigning Cave Creek Fiesta Days Rodeo Queen for the past two years. Tall and slim with golden curls, she could have won the competition on looks alone. But not here; not among these hard-working gals. Instead, she’s proven herself worthy time and again, breaking her own horses, developing her own breeding program and holding her own in competitions against some of the best pro rodeo barrel racers in the country.
“I’ve always been treated fairly,” Barlow said with quiet confidence. “I’ve always worked as hard as the guys, and they treat me like I’m one of them. It’s nice to represent women and girls, and it’s always a good feeling when they announce that this is a rodeo queen competing.
“People live and breathe this,” she continued. “It’s not a beauty contest. You have to work hard to do well, and I love it when little girls look up to me and say, ‘I want to be you someday.’”
The women of Cave Creek Pro Rodeo are more than a sisterhood; they’re part of a family. Like any family, everyone – male and female – is important. Each of them knows that, although they all have different personalities, strengths and weaknesses, they are there for each other and the rest of the rodeo family in good times and in bad.
“I am lucky to be surrounded by dedicated and talented women on this rodeo committee,” said Casale. “We support each other in so many ways.”
These women are doing an excellent job of continuing a long tradition. The PRCA is the largest and oldest rodeo-sanctioning body in the world. The organization sanctions more than 600 rodeos annually in 38 states, in addition to four Canadian provinces, and ensures that every PRCA-sanctioned event is managed fairly and that the animals are treated humanely.
Some of the toughest bulls and bucking horses will once again be at this year’s Cave Creek Pro Rodeo, thanks to Cervi Championship Rodeo. Known for world-class stock, they are responsible for luring some of the top competitors who know that tough rides mean high points.
Gold Buckle sponsors Kennedy Design Build, GoDaddy.com, Coors Banquet, Wal-Mart, Harold’s Cave Creek Corral, A to Z Equipment Rentals & Sales and the Town of Cave Creek, as well as the many Silver Buckle and other great rodeo sponsors have been integral in keeping this fun family event alive in Cave Creek. Additional partnerships are still needed to keep the rodeo spirit alive in our community.
Tickets are available online, and rodeo fans will want to purchase them early since seats are expected to sell out.
The schedule of events is as follows:
March 20
• Third Annual Fiesta Days Dan Lebsock Memorial Golf Tournament and Fundraiser. Join your favorite rodeo supporters on the green at Dove Valley Ranch Golf Club, followed by dinner and awards at Harold’s Cave Creek Corral.
March 22

All Pro Rodeo events are held at the Cave Creek Memorial Arena, with the exceptions of the golf tournament, parade and dances. The arena is located north of Carefree Highway. Follow 24th Street north, then turn right on Maddock. The arena is located at the first elbow in the road.
If you’d like to join the rodeo family, whether you join the committee or simply show up to help during rodeo weekend, the men and women of the Cave Creek Pro Rodeo Committee can use your assistance. You don’t have to be a cowboy to join the association; you just need to care about making a difference in your community. Approximately 150 volunteers are needed during the rodeo weekend to make it run smoothly. Contact the committee online for more information.- SA News • Jul. 23, 2014• 2 Comments

(I learned long ago not to smile at people more than 5ft away as it is never who I think; the Girl Who Smiled Too Affectionately At Strangers forced to become The Girl Who Doesn't Smile At All, Her Eyelashes Not To Be Hidden Behind The Glare of Actual Vision.) But this weekend something shifted. My landlady invited us to dinner with our other neighbors, her home a topsy turvy mystery house she built herself using only recycled materials and found objects. We ate roasted chicken on her rooftop and drank wine, all of us characters from an Armistead Maupin story sans Jonestown, the children staying well away from the edge. The next day another neighbor baked us an apple pie--an apple fucking pie! And although I was in my bathrobe and had never been formally introduced I wanted to hug her, but not before I ransacked my own kitchen for something to proffer in return. Here kind neighbor lady! Care for some string cheese?
Then Sunday. Oh, Sunday. Easter, bloody, palm or passion, Sunday was the day of the Blog Out Loud event and I am still reeling from the kindness of strangers who are not at all strange. And here I gush: Megan and Rebecca are pretty much the most creative, dynamic women I have ever met. And genuinely nice. And, and, and: And I am thinking I should save the gush for a post when I can publish some of the video from said event. However, I would be remiss in not mentioning my fellow panelists who also deserve pancakes and pies, they are so rad: Sasha from The Bell Jar, Anne from The City Sage, Christiana from Ferm Living, Cassandra from Coco + Kelley and Lynn from Paris Hotel Boutique. A trickle of a gush, video content to come.
So yes, this weekend life was beautiful, la vie en rose, tra la la, the smell of bacon in the morning. And now I feel the need to give back to a Youniverse that is so Yes. Presenting the Second Annual Petunia Face Birthday Giveaway! Last year I gave away a fossil that not many people wanted; this year I am giving away a handmade scarf knit by Yours Truly that hopefully more people will want. Here is a pic of the piece that is in no way a master:
Thank you guys. Really, honestly, thank you for everything. If I could make the world a scarf today I would. Or at the very least a pie, but I am a terrible baker and have no apples.
Happy Monday.
xoxo,

I think that life is good because I have a comfortable place to live, we are in generally good health, I have a relationship with God, enough food to eat, a daughter who is bright and active and a husband who loves me. My life is not perfect, but it's mine and the only one I've got!
I like butter wrapped around my neck, so I'm in!
Life is good, well, because even though money is tight, and I'm up nights stressing about which bills to pay and which to put off my kids have no idea. They are fed, clothed, and get more love than they could ever need. We spend lots of time at home playing, cuddling and laughing. I'm happy, and that's saying alot. So money be damned, life is good.
Life is good - I have all the comforts of a roof over my head, food to eat and the health of my children and loved ones. Life is good and i savor every moment - as I have lost my 2 best friends in the last year to cancer and my dad to a murder - and given all the tragedy - I chose to live, smile and enjoy each moment as life is also short and I want to honor myself and my loved ones here and not here by living the best life possible and making a difference in people's lives.
I adore your blog and look forward to reading it daily. Have a good day!
Life is good because
A) I'm not a dead turtle
B) Or a turtle with prosthetic furniture sliders glued under my shell.
C) My name isn't spelled stupid like: Sheryn, or Cherin, or Sharron. Its just plain Sharon.
D) I have nice hair (Thanks Mom)
Life is good because I have a lovely little house, a baby on the way and a truly wonderful husband. I am getting more and more excited for our new arrival, and am falling more in love with my husband each day. I feel as if I'm surrounded by people who are excited for me too, and it feels so nice.
Life is good because yesterday I found a penny and actually had good luck all day long.
Life is good because my husband cleaned the house while I was out playing with my best friend.
Life is good because when I decided I needed peanut butter and banana for dinner, I had just enough peanut butter left in the jar, and the milk hadn't gone bad yet.
And finally, life is good because although I can bake an apple pie like a mofo, my knitting abilities are subpar, and like magic this giveaway appeared.
your daughter is so stunning- i could see why she might inspire you to blog!!!
As I sat by a campfire Saturday night with dirt wedged into every orifice and a mosquito chewing on my neck, I was filled with contentment that my good hubby was by my side and my five year old was snuggled in my lap in her pajamas, drifting off to sleep.
She starts school this week and life will be changing in a big way, so I'm clinging on to these moments....
It was wonderful beyond words to meet you this weekend Susannah! (And to meet Miss Zoey too :)
And if you have any apple pie left (unlikely, I know) I'm all too happy to come take if off your hands! And for future reference: will trade cookies for pie.
Life is good because of toddler belly laughs, peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, sticky finger prints on my windows, squeeky little voices singing "when I gwow up I wanna be a wock and woll star", blond piggy tails, purple glasses, and big brown puppy dog eyes.
Life is hard and it is complicated. And that makes it
challenging and beautiful and very very good. And it makes the flowers smell extra nice.
It's too early for scarves. Don't you wait until you need a scarf to start making a scarf?
Life is good because I have learned to be thankful. Thankful for peace in a time of chaos, for lessons learned and food eaten. Thankful for holding hands and clean clothes. For central heating and air and splashing in the bathtub. Thankful for laughter and memories, forgiveness and honesty, prayer and the power behind it. Thankful for new life and bodies that can sustain it. For freedom and victory in our own sense, for sacrifice and loss that we eventually recover from. Thankful for self-discovery and that feeling when you finally realize you're exactly where you're meant to be. Thankful for dancing even when there isn't any music. For bleach and the smell of fresh lemons. For finding friendship in the most unlikely place. Thankful for rain and child-like adventure. For photographs and books, the perfect bra and one beautiful diamond ring. Thankful for promises and integrity, for faith and second chances. Thankful for the beauty that pushes and shoves its way through ugliness. Thankful that life is always good, even when it's not.
First, I loved the Blog Out Loud event last night and it was fun and kind of shy-making to meet you in person (or re-meet you after seventh grade...). Second, my post today is all about how effing happy and content I am these days so I am so totally getting your vibe. Thirdly, you knit? Stop. Just Stop. But I do want the scarf. I want the scarf because the universe is good. And the universe is good because instead of a job, I have a life.
It was great to meet you face to face at The Event yesterday. And imagine my surprise at being handed a packet of petunia seeds "by the girl herself" while waiting to speak with you. And getting a gander at that dish, Bryan. A hat trick! Anyhoo, thanks for chatting with me, it was a little like meeting a celebrity...
Life is good because the humidity in the Midwest has been (knock on wood) strangely absent this spring, I got free Chik-Fil-A for lunch and the library has no limits on how many items I can check out at a time nor how many times I may renew said items.
Happy Birthday in advance :)
AW! I would have gone to the blog out loud event...if my grandchildren weren't in town. Yeah. That's right. GRANDCHILDREN. They call me Grandma Rose without a hint of sarcasm, because, after all. I am their grandmother....sigh.

Life is good because I can feel the dewey mist of fog on my face; I can hear the deep joyous giggles of my sweet little crumb; I can sense the warm and comforting presence of my husband as he enters the room; I can see the magnificent splendor of the world around me; I find hope in the goodness of people.
Life is indeed good due to the fact that I have wine, a lovely family and a roof over our heads. And did you know Michael Jackson might be alive? He allegedly walked out of the ambulance he was supposed to be dead in.
Also, I would wear the shit out of that scarf. Perfect for my little Colorado life.
Happy, happy birthday to you.
Your scarf kinda reminds me of neopolitan ice cream - it would be delightful to wear around my neck as I cavort around Boston!
Life is Good because I will soon be working a 4-day week!
Life is ... the quickening. That term professionals give to the very first flutterings you may feel during the first trimester of pregnancy. I was 18 and alone and to be frank,scared shitless. I was laying on my newly pregnant tummy, staring at the night sky and my pyscho neighbor with the shotgun aimed at anyone even about to get close to his car when it happened. Huh? what was that? There it was again! I jumped up and sat in my wicker king back chair. This was 1982 people! they were ALL the rage.I lit a Marlboro 100, again, what the hell did I know??? I felt those flutters and jumps again! I knew, right then in those first few moments I wanted this! Whatever this was, I wasent sure at that point, but I WANTED. I was overwhelmed, I was alone, I was penniless but I had LIFE! And let me just say, my beautiful LIFE has never let me down.Her name is Tara. P.S. Wicker chair went to the garbage in 1983 and smoking habit soon followed!
Life is good because my kids are awesome. I've gone through losing my home along with some of my dignity and a big ass chunk of money, but my family is still intact and for that I'm so grateful. I realized yesterday just how good life is when I took my little Zoe to the eye doctor and she was able to read the second to largest letters out of the eye she is almost totally blind in. To see that little bit of improvement brought tears to my eyes.
Life is good because I discovered the magic of apricot preserves and brie sandwiches. I can drink cucumber infused gin as often as I want to. It's good because I have a crush on a man who arranged for our first date to be a picnic. Because there will always be too many books to read, too many songs to hear, too many movies to watch, too many exhibits to see. Because between Bravo and TLC there are endless occupation-based reality TV shows. Life is good because pillow-top mattresses exist, even if I will probably never be able to afford one. It's good because I'm crazy enough to feel comfortable going camping when none of us know how to light a fire or set up a tent. Because there exists a fake Bavarian village in the mountains in Washington. Because sometimes I listen to my iPod when I walk home at night and am pretty sure it won't be stolen. Life is good because even though I'm unemployed, I still get Starbucks at least three times a week instead of making the 10cents/cup coffee I buy at Trader Joe's.
Interesting post you got here. It would be great to read something more about that theme. Thank you for giving this information.

If a certain Dallas mayor orders a pizza Thursday, you can be sure of one thing: It won’t be a Meat Lover’s. (At least not in public; there’s no telling what Mike Rawlings does behind closed doors.)
That’s because the former Pizza Hut bossman and pizza connoisseur has declared Thursday “Great American Meatout Day” in Dallas. He joins mayors from Baltimore, Maryland; Kalamazoo, Michigan; Moorehead, Minnesota; and Asheville and Charlotte, North Carolina, in asking folks to start off their spring cleansing by abstaining from meat for just one day.
Or, as only Dallas’ Official Proclamation puts it: “Kick the meat habit.”
As you’re no doubt aware, Rawlings won’t sign just anything, so, clearly, this is something near and dear to his heart. As in: “A wholesome diet of vegetables, fresh fruits and whole grains promotes health and reduces the risk of heart diseases, stroke, cancer, diabetes, and other chronic diseases that affect 1.3 million Americans annually,” per the proclamation below, which he signed last Wednesday.
The mayor wants you to explore a “plant-based diet.” And, no, not that. That’s actually an Oreo-based diet.
Mike Rawlings Great American Meatout DaySANFORD, Fla. - The judge in the George Zimmerman murder trial ruled Monday that jurors' identities will be kept secret for now, and she'll decide later when their names can be made public.
As jury selection continued, Florida Circuit Court Judge Debra Nelson heard arguments on whether prosecutors will be permitted to present voice identification witness testimony about whose voice is heard screaming on an audio tape moments before Trayvon Martin was shot through the heart last year.
She scheduled more arguments Wednesday on the voice identification issue.
Zimmerman, who is charged with murdering Trayvon, 17, sat quietly through the long day of court proceedings without saying much. He has pleaded not guilty to a second-degree murder charge saying he killed the teenager in self-defense, after following him at the apartment complex where Trayvon was visiting. Prosecutors argue that Zimmerman profiled and confronted the teen.
Defense attorneys asked Nelson to keep jurors' names from being released until six months after the trial ends. After a jury found Casey Anthony not guilty, their names weren't released until after a three-month cooling-off period.
Zimmerman's attorney Mark O'Mara said six months is "a sufficient amount of time for any community passions to cool, should an acquittal occur, or for the matter to begin its appellate process, should an acquittal not occur."
He said six months would give jurors long enough to prepare for their names to be released, and he cited concerns from potential jurors who said they were worried about their anonymity and safety.
"This will allow sufficient time for the jurors to move on with their lives, and to plan for any residual concerns, should they exist," O'Mara said.
Scott Ponce, an attorney representing several news media companies, argued against the defense motion and asked that the parties come back a week after the verdict to determine how long to keep juror identities secret.
Nelson said that the names would remain secret for now and she would decide later when to release them.
As of Monday afternoon, 49 people had been questioned by lawyers about their exposure to media accounts of the Feb. 26, 2012 shooting. For more than a week, prosecutors and defense attorneys have grilled potential jurors about how much they know about the case, which news outlets they prefer, and whether they can give Zimmerman a fair trial.
Lawyers also asked whether they can handle being sequestered and have dismissed those who say obligations or views keep them from being able to serve.
One woman, a single mother with two children younger than 14, said she couldn't handle being a juror because of her obligations as a parent. Another man said he gave $20 to Zimmerman's legal defense fund. "I was pro-Zimmerman," the man said. "You're entitled to self defense." Both were dismissed.
This phase of questioning is called "pre-publicity voir dire." General voir dire will include questions about what the potential jurors think about the case. Thirty-two people have made it to the pool for general questioning. However, eight more are needed for that phase to begin.
O'Mara says he hopes to have a jury of six people seated by Friday.
Nelson was also hearing arguments to determine whether testimony from prosecutors' voice identification experts are reliable enough to be admissible., testified that the 911 call should not be evaluated because there isn't sufficient material to assess who is heard screaming.
Wayman said Reich's report was baffling, and methods used by another prosecution expert, Tom Owen, have never been used to evaluate recordings like the 911 call.
"A lot of this appears to be like magic," said Wayman. "I was baffled."
Wayman added that if the methods used by prosecution experts were correct they would be "breathtakingly new and novel" and would be worthy of an award similar to the Nobel Peace Prize. He said he doubted, however, that such a breakthrough had occurred and said instead that prosecution experts were reflecting predispositions to hear words and voices in the recording.
After more than four hours of testimony by Wayman, the hearing was to continue Wednesday at 4 p.m. State prosecutors plan to call Owen to rebut Wayman's claims about his work.

Poem Edited: Thursday, SeptemberK Chicago to New York regularly to film, when the topic of germ-filled planes arose.
Watch here, beginning around the 2:10 mark:
After giving an audible sigh, Kristin Cavallari confessed, “We didn’t vaccinate.” In between former MTV VJ Kennedy refuting her statements, the pregnant blonde explained:
“You know what, I’ve read too many books about autism…There is a pediatric group called Homestead — Homestead or Homefirst, . . . “
Kristin Cavallari is now, as you might imagine, being torn apart in around the web. The Blemish reports she and husband Jay Cutler “have come out as vaccine truthers aka idiots,” while a large number of tweets follow this line of thought: “Is there a vaccination for stupid?”
She’s right on at least one thing, I’ll admit — the autism statistics are scary. That’s about it, though, as far as I can see. As Think Progress reports, “Every major global public health organization has repeatedly refuted the notion that vaccinations have any link to autism. But that message isn’t getting through to every parent.”
Whooping cough is also scary, and so are the other illnesses vaccines protect our entire population against. My two boys were vaccinated on schedule, and I remember each time they got a shot feeling a little tingling of fear something bad might come of it. We did it though, because rationally I know it’s the right thing.
There’s more on from the BabyCenter experts on vaccines and immunizations here.
What do you say in response to Kristin Cavallari’s reason not to vaccinate her kids?
Photo: REXUSA
Kristin Cavallari isn’t the only one who’s afraid. Check out what other celebrities have had to say over the years about getting vaccines and immunizations:
Yawn. 1 in 88 kids has autism — no proven causal effect (and the one that people had relied on totally undermined and falsified). No mention that more kids are diagnosed as autistic than there used to be, which gives rise to an increase. People who don’t vaccinate are pure and simple doing their kids and society a disservice, and totally selfish. If you breastfeed or turn your carseat at 1 year of age – your issue, you kid. Not vaccinating and effect on herd immunity – involves my kid and society, and makes you selfish.
And, the opinion coming from “reality star” Kristi Cavallari. Not a researcher. Not a physician. No medical qualifications. So convincing.
The CDC has been hiding information for years and here is a link discussing the connection between mercury and autism.

CDC Caught Hiding Data Showing Mercury in Vaccines Linked to Autism
328
Dr. Coleen Boyle of the CDC testifies under oath before Congress in November 2012 that the body of evidence shows there is no connection between mercury in vaccines and autism.
Health Impact News Editor Comments
In a press release issued this week, one that so far.
by A Shot of Truth
PRWeb
Have you ever met a child with polio? I live in the third world, I have, and it broke my heart. The government here provides vaccines free of charge. For all of those who “don’t trust the government” – blah blah blah – here and everywhere, these vaccines save lives. I usually don’t weigh in on vaccine debates, but I’m sick and tired of celebrities (or quasi-celebs) giving out misinformation on this topic.
If I had to choose between a deadly disease that can kill or autism I choose autism. Plain and simple.
Until there is even an iota of evidence supporting the position that vaccines cause autism, positions like this need to be quickly denounced. There is way too much danger in not vaccinating. By the way,there is some thoughts that nonvaccinating could lead to the evolution of diseases currently treatable by vaccines, rendering vaccines ineffective. So thanks non-vaccinators!
I APPLAUD her. I have a 21 year old vaccine injured daughter and I am vaccine injured myself. I got vaccinations I had never had at almost the same time as my daughter received hers as a babe. Life has never been the same for either of us. I went from being a vibrant dance teachers, doing flips and leaps in an outdoor drama to walking with a cane. I got sick and never recovered. It has been a 20 year nightmare. If people think vaccinations are one size fits all, they are nuts. NOTHING is one size fits all and that includes vaccines. I have studied and studied…SO MUCH research. I fear we have swapped one set of maladies, deaths and injuries for another. And it is NOT ok for ANY of our children to be ‘acceptable collateral damage” in the name of herd immunity. She is being a protective mother bear and that is fabulous!!
she is sadly totally uneducated on the matter. I hope her pediatrician has more sense and her baby is going to be vaccinated after all (without headlines).
Wow, in reading the above comments, I have to add this. There is TONS of evidence connecting vaccinations to autism. It is a shame the media never covers it. I am law school trained so I KNOW the importance of only researching in reliable sources so when I do vaccination research, I am careful. I remember reading one research paper where and INDEPENDENT researcher (knowing who funds a study is very important) did nothing but count all the reliable studies that said there is a connection and those who said there were not. Her outcome was that 70 percent of all studies said there either was a connection or there was enough evidence to merit more study; 30 percent said no. Go to the National Vaccine Information Center for more info. Or to the government reporting center called VAERS (where dr.’s report adverse vaccine events) OR look at the money paid out by the “vaccine court” (that’s another story). Another place to give a look is The Canary Party.
She’s an idiot, and a dangerous one at that.
I know this is the celeb beat, but seriously, can we drop the idiots who are anti-vax? Kids and babies DIE when they speak. And if that doesn’t go against what BabyCenter stands for, I don’t know what does.
As for Brian Hooker: he can’t even decide what question he wants answered when he criticizes studies. It’s like talking to a third grader about geometry proofs–“It’s a square, right?”
And people, please, drop it with the vaccine courts already. I will explain this one more time:
1) In 22 years, there have been 5600 claims filed. 2600 claims were rewarded. 1 claim was related to autism.
2) In those 22 years, how many millions of vaccines were given?
3) A few adverse reactions are normal.
4) Vaccines are safe for the vast majority of people
And no, there are NO STUDIES–none, not one–that have shown that vaccines cause autism. The ones that purport to show that vaccines cause autism have major problems with experimental design, have conflicting interests, cannot be replicated, etc etc etc. Show me a paper that says that vaccines cause autism and I will show you 10 letters pointing out everything that the authors did wrong and 15 papers refuting the point.
Tell a parent who lost their child to pneumonia (a common complication of measles–30% of cases) that vaccines are deadly. Tell a mom whose child spent 3 days suffocating from whooping cough that not getting a vaccine is a responsible thing to do. Send your child to Pakistan–after all, vaccines are more dangerous than polio.
107 studies that show that vaccines and autism are not related:
“Dr. Andrew Wakefield is used as the standard scapegoat being presented as a “disgraced doctor” who supposedly got caught fabricating his study. Of course, Dr. Andrew Wakefield’s study has been replicated in at least 28 other studies.”
EXCELLENT. Please cite for me those studies.
*crickets*
Right. That is because they do not exist. Don’t go getting your “science” from propaganda websites.
I will take my son with autism over a dead child any day. My advisor is post-polio and watching what he struggles with is enough of a reason to vaccinate. For the record both of my children were vaccinated, one son has autism and one does not.
Those 28 studies are by Wakefield, friends of Wakefield and people Wakefield paidWeather Trends: November 2013
November 2013 is projected to be the coldest in five years for the United States as a whole and wetter than last year. A majority of the nation will trend colder than last year, but there will be some milder year-on-year trends in the east mainly due to warmer overnight temperatures; daytime temperatures will actually be closer to or even below normal. Snowfall will be greater than last year and likely the second most in 10 years for the nation as a whole. The first and last weeks of the month will be the highest risk period for snow in the Northern Rocky Mountains. The last week of November will be the highest risk period for snow in the Northern Plains and New England. Compared to the disruptions from Hurricane Sandy last year, demand for all seasonal categories during early November across the Northeast will be stronger. Replenishment systems will have a great deal of difficulty digesting the impacts of Sandy. Temperatures turn much colder compared to last year for a majority of the nation during the week of Black Friday, which is favorable for cold weather items like coats, hats, gloves, electric blankets and other seasonal gifts.<<Popular Science Monthly/Volume 19/September 1881/Editor's Table
The "Atlantic Monthly" did well in publishing in its July issue two articles on the "Ladies' Deposit," a fraudulent banking concern in Boston, of which so much was said last year. One of these articles, by Mr. Henry A. Clapp, gives a history of the scheme, and is evidently written with care and with good knowledge of the facts. The other paper is by Miss Mary Abigail Dodge, who had some experience with the institution, and she presents the feminine side of the case. As the excitement of the affair is now passed away, and we have the main facts fairly before us, it seems proper to look a little into the lessons it teaches; and to do this it will be desirable to recall briefly its leading features. In this we follow the statements of Mr. Clapp.
By whomsoever planned, the scheme of the "Ladies' Deposit" was carried out by a woman named Howe, and she was undoubtedly its master-spirit. The revelations at the sequel show her to have been a vulgar female impostor, a clairvoyant, and fortune-telling adventuress, who had run a long career of petty crime in New England. She first married a half-breed negro, or Indian, named Solomon, who is now living in Rhode Island. They lived together some thirteen years, but the marriage was void on account of the law against the union of persons of different colors. She next married a man named Lane, or Chase, Mr. Solomon being a diligent promoter of the second union. Lane is said to have died at sea, when she married Florimund L. Howe, a house-painter and dancing-master, who is her present husband. The pair adventured about the country for several years, getting a miserable living in precarious ways, and the woman's conduct was at times so "queer" that in 1867 she was sent to the State Lunatic Asylum in Taunton, where she remained two years. In 1875 she was caught in the perpetration of an elaborate set of frauds and sent to Jail, but got out before the expiration of her time through a technical mistake in her indictment.
She is represented as illiterate and in many ways very ignorant, but "she has always been a keen observer, a quick learner, and a shrewd student of human nature. It would be more nearly correct to call her unmoral than immoral; for from her extreme youth she appeared to have a serious constitutional difficulty in discerning the difference between right and wrong, between her own property and her neighbors'. All her thieving has been marked by a grand air of unconsciousness, rather than by eager, covetous greed. Her disposition seems to be somewhat good-natured and generous, and to show a kind of native bonhomie, and at the height of her prosperity as a 'banker' she became very popular with a certain set which was especially rich in mesmerists, fortunetellers, and female physicians of the irregular sort." She has "abundant cunning," "a great natural gift of utterance," "a singularly plausible manner," and to her other accomplishments it must be added that "she is one of the most exuberant, spontaneous, imaginative, and unnecessary liars that ever breathed."
This woman at length planted herself down in Boston as a "banker." When she began, or how she began, is involved in mystery. Her scheme seems to have been copied in its main features from that of a Bavarian swindler—an ex-actress named Adele Spitzeder—"which was operated in Munich from 1869 to 1872, and by which the Bavarians were cheated out of millions of dollars. . . . Both opened banks of deposit, promised preposterous returns of interest, and successfully invited loans of money from the public. Neither had any pecuniary capital or offered any security, the sole and sufficient reliance of each being upon her own impudence and the combined cupidity and credulity of her customers. Each made friends by playing the Lady Bountiful upon occasion, had a mixed party of gulls and knaves committed to her cause, drew herself out of poverty and into luxurious comfort by means of her bank, ended her career in prison, and left assets enough behind her to pay her creditors a dividend of about five per cent." It is significant that the astounding Bavarian fraud had run its course and exploded, and was reported ail over the world seven years before the successful repetition of the experiment was made in Boston.
The main trick of Mrs. Howe was, however, a shrewd improvement upon the Bavarian method. For while Frãulein Spitzeder took deposits from everybody who would make them—high and low, rich and poor, male and female—Mrs. Howe artfully restricted the benefits of her institution to women, and to those, moreover, of small means. No woman owning a house could make a deposit, and no deposits were received less than two hundred dollars, nor more than one thousand dollars. Interest at the rate of eight per cent, per month was paid every three months—that is, twenty-four per cent, quarterly—and the payment was in advance. To the question how it was possible to pay such large interest, the reply was, "We never disclose the methods by which we do business"; "we do not solicit"; "you need not deposit unless you wish"; "we never give references." But, notwithstanding this, it was stated that the "Ladies' Deposit" is a charitable institution for the benefit of single ladies, old and young, of small means, and it was obscurely intimated that the money was intrusted to the Boston agency for this charitable use by a rich "Quaker Aid Society" of Virginia. Mrs. Howe refused to tell how the funds thus derived were invested, because, as she craftily said, "she was afraid of the displeasure of her superior officers." Yet, thoroughly baseless as was the project which could give no open account of itself, and utterly absurd as were its promises, it nevertheless had a rushing success. Each new depositor had to be introduced by a previous depositor. There was a great show of strictness in inquiring into their fitness. The first depositors, when they had got their enormous interest, reported it to their friends, and the craze spread rapidly among the Boston women to avail themselves of the speculation. That they were the recipients of a charity made no difference. The bank would have nothing to do with men, and constantly encouraged the idea that women were abundantly capable of transacting their own business without masculine advice. And so money poured in by the thousands. The big interest was paid out of the influx, and if a depositor wanted her money back she could have it any day but Sunday, and with it she got the curt notice that she need not apply again. The result was that the "miserable old rogue," with her "swindling savings-bank," in the course of a few months drew from the pockets of ten or twelve hundred New England women no less than half a million dollars. The "Boston Advertiser" at length attacked the concern vigorously, and it collapsed in three weeks. A few of the earlier depositors received their large interest, and got out also with their principal; but when the scheme was pushed into insolvency there remained only five per cent, of their investments for some eight hundred depositors.
As was natural, the women who had walked into this trap and lost their money were roundly denounced for their credulity and business incapacity. Miss Dodge resents this charge in her usual spirited way, launches profuse invectives upon the men who broke up the fraud, and, while not excusing Mrs. Howe, defends her sex from the assaults of masculine "insolence, ignorance, and stupidity." She proposes to show that "the history of the Ladies' Deposit does not demonstrate the credulity of women, the immorality of women, or the educational or political incapacity of women." If not successful in proving these positions, she, at any rate, shuts the mouth of her masculine critics by showing that men too are abundantly imposed upon and cheated, and are therefore credulous and stupid as well as the women.
The subject is here widened, and our chief interest in the affair relates to this aspect of it. What are the conditions that made this transaction possible? What are the causes that led to it and which lead to other kindred results? The particular event has passed away, and in itself is of but little moment; but what sort of a tree is that which bears such fruit? The state of mind that produced it still continues, and we may expect the same things to be done again and again, with only a change of names, forms, and tactics. That which has just now had a conspicuous feminine expression is by no means wholly an affair of sex, but is a common phenomenon. The Ladies' Deposit was in fact but a drop in the bucket compared with the omnipresent impostures and cheats of all grades and qualities which are transacted everywhere. What is the condition of mind which leads to them?
We state nothing new in saying that such impostures as Howe's bank prove a widespread deficiency in mental cultivation. It has been urged that there is a gross want of instruction in our schools in the elementary principles of economics, a knowledge of which would serve as a protection in emergencies of this kind. Undoubtedly more of political economy in our common-school education would be useful, but it must be remembered that our swindles are by no means limited to the financial sort, while the public mind is probably more alert in this direction than in any other. To rectify the evil by the application of special knowledge would require scores of new subjects to be introduced into our public-school curriculum. Besides, had political economy been taught in the New England schools as other things are there taught, we are not sure that it would have made much difference with the chances of Mrs. Howe's banking adventure. The difficulty was not so much a lack of knowledge on this particular subject as a lack of that mental preparation which would qualify for meeting the whole class of impositions of which the Ladies' Deposit was but a single example.
The Boston women were undoubtedly cheated through their credulity, and this state of mind was palpably exemplified by a thousand of them. But the same state of mind is exhibited by many other thousands of both men and women all over the country; and it is this which has to be met by education before any efficient protection can be gained against its mischievous results. Credulity is easy belief, and the correction of it is, of course, hardness of belief. The credulous person is careless of evidence, and is, therefore, readily duped; the only remedy for this is doubt, distrust, an appreciation of the importance of evidence, and a trained capacity to judge of it. It is necessary that this state of suspicion and questioning become a habit of the mind, and the sifting of evidence in practical affairs a distinct branch of mental cultivation. To escape the evil effects of credulity it is needful that disbelief as an attitude of mind be encouraged as a virtue. The resistance to evidence must be active and vigorous until it is proved to be not spurious and illusive, but sound and valid. Our current culture is here profoundly at fault. Literary education, as such, does not favor this habit of mind; scientific education properly pursued leads to it necessarily. Literature flourished in its highest forms in the ages of credulity, while modern science only arose with the growth of the spirit of doubt. Training in the methods of scientific study seems, therefore, to us, the only adequate remedy for that laxity of thinking and dull credulity of the popular mind in which widespread deceptions and impostures have their origin.
But science also greatly helps us here in the things it teaches. It familiarizes the mind with the conception of an order in human life, the invincible operation of cause and effect in social affairs, and the laws of proportion between actions and consequences to which all persons are subject. That there are natural laws in society which work out their inevitable results is a lesson that requires to be learned as well by the individual as by the state; and scientific education alone can familiarize the minds of the young with this vital truth.
Here our literary education fails. It does not reach, and expound, and enforce this class of ideas. It is so thoroughly verbal and critical in form and spirit as actually to arrest the mind on its way to the study of things. In this way absorption in literature becomes a barrier to science, which, by its nature, must deal directly with facts and principles. Science merely addressed to the apprehension, and lodged in the memory like literary acquisitions, is not true science; and little would be gained by introducing social science into our schools, to be pursued there in the manner of other studies. Literary culture, as it predominates in our educational institutions, neither prepares the mind to deal intelligently with questions of evidence nor does it imbue it with right conceptions of social order and the laws of human relation, and it, therefore, affords but little protection against those vagaries and extravagances of belief which have their root in credulity.
Miss Dodge's apology for the women, in the "Atlantic," is a good illustration of this. Keen, brilliant, thoroughly cultivated as she is, she does not seem for a, moment to recognize that the first duty of every woman introduced to Howe's bank was to demand and insist upon the clear evidence of its validity. She does not seem to consider that intelligence or judgment of facts had any function in the affair. Promises certainly extravagant were made, and stories certainly improbable were told, and they were all swallowed without a serious question, but Miss Dodge can see no credulity in it! The notion that the concern was a grand charity appeared so possible, so probable, and so noble, that the poor women were justified in investing in it without any of those precautions that are dictated by universal experience in these matters. Indeed, Miss Dodge seems to think that Howe's bank is a kind of ideal type of beneficence on which this miserable world might well be remodeled. In the good time coming we are entitled to expect boundless largess, and a thundering rate of interest for everybody. She says: "If there had been a great charity at the basis, I do not see how any wiser mode of distribution could have been framed. In view of the inexpressible relief which was afforded in the dozen or so cases of which I learned in the course of the discussion, I feel a thrill of regret whenever I remember that there was nothing in it."
As a matter of probability, that is of evidence as a basis of action, Miss Dodge thinks that eight per cent, a month is not half so incredible or absurd as the working of the present order of nature. With God's government of the world at a paltry six or seven per cent, annually she seems disgusted, declaring, "In regard to general probability I candidly avow that no originality and no magnitude of charity is so incredible as that the Omnipotent Creator of the world should let things go on as they are."
Miss Dodge reasons that the women were excusable for patronizing Mrs. Howe's bank with its magnificent promises because people do actually get benefactions often princely in aU sorts of irregular and improbable ways. Dr. Cullis's Home for Consumptives in the heart of Boston, professedly supported by prayer alone, and the Woman's Faith Home for Incurables, in Brooklyn, supported also as is said by faith and prayer, are thought worth referring to, and she adds, "If Christ could fish up money out of the sea wherewithal to pay his taxes, and if he said, 'He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also, and greater works than these shall he do,' why should it seem a. thing incredible that he should pluck from the pockets of the rich a hundred-fold or ninety-sixfold the slender means of the deserving poor?"
These are side-considerations for her religious critics, but Miss Dodge thinks that politics teaches the same lesson. She says, "No one can live long and intimately in political circles without being prepared for any development whatever of generosity and magnanimity," Most true! and alike in Howe's bank and in politics we are not to inquire too curiously into the sources of the generosity. It was the pride of Tweed that betook splendid care of his friends, and the magnanimities of political circles are too generally in proportion as politicians are thieves—they are proverbially generous with the public money! But, even where politicians are not thieves, their circles are full of bounties in the shape of offices and patronage that come as chance advantages to the undeserving, like lottery-prizes has been attained by former methods. Mr. Bryant argues for the state compulsory system as against the voluntary system, but the great advancements of civilization have been incontestably made by private enterprise, and spontaneous coöperation among the members of the community, and with these things the state has only meddled to hinder. The state originates nothing; its highest office is simply to secure the conditions under which the voluntary combinations of individuals for desirable objects shall have the fullest and freest play. Nor is the progress of education any exception to this law. The work of originating and extending knowledge, and of diffusing it by the formation of schools, the organization of societies, the institution of academies, and the establishment of colleges, has always been mainly done by the individual forces of society working under voluntary coöperation and independent of government. Besides, all the tendencies of modern progress are to give larger scope to private enterprise, and to relinquish to the people prerogatives that formerly belonged to government. It is now proposed to contradict this law of advancement by surrendering to the state the whole duty of directing the mental development of its citizens. Mr. Bryant maintains that the right of state control in the matter of educaion is a necessary consequence of state sovereignty, and he argues that, in the course of political development, the family is superseded, the state assuming the parental functions. lie says: ."
Here, again, the law of progress is misread. Nothing is more certain than that it has resulted in cutting down state sovereignty to make room for individual rights. Man's development has ever been an acquirement of rights against the state, and, in all political advancement, the state has consequently become less and less, and the citizen more and more. The progress of civil liberty has been from the beginning a wresting of power from despotic state sovereignty. Men fought early and desperately for the right of life—that is, that they should not have their heads cut off at the caprice of a sovereign will. They wrung from the state the right of the individual ownership of property. They reduced the functions of the state when it repressed free speech for its own sovereign purposes. They stripped the state of its power of determining what religion it thinks best for the community, and thus secured the rights of conscience. In all these things, and in many more, government has been restrained and hampered in its tyrannical meddlings, and the people have correspondingly gained in liberty. The state has always assumed that it knew more about what was good for the people than they knew themselves. What we call liberty is nothing more than the right of the people to be their own judges, and to manage their own concerns in the way that seems best for the promotion of their own interests. But Mr. Bryant interprets state sovereignty in a way that dissolves all individual rights. If the state may interfere at its "sovereign discretion" to extirpate the family in the matter of education, if it may take away a child as soon as it is ready for the Kindergarten, and dictate the whole course of its cultivation, stamping its character with a view to state objects, what else may it not do, and what becomes of the vaunted freedom of the citizen? The doctrine belongs to despotism, and was first and fitly practiced in Prussia as a means of shaping subjects to the uses of kingly power.
And now what is the state that claims such prerogatives in virtue of its sovereignty, and proposes to take the education of the whole community into its own hands? Divested of the glamour that surrounds this venerable abstraction, that which remains of actual reality is simply a lot of men got together to carry on the practical work of government. The state lives in the life of its representatives. It exists only as embodied in its officials. Certain men are chosen to make, repeal, and execute the laws, and these are the state. The state can do whatever they can do; the state is whatever they are. But we are not yet down to the naked reality. The community is divided into two great political parties, and the one that beats by numbers at election takes the government. Successful office-seekers, therefore, constitute the state. Those who succeed in partisan politics are those who cultivate the art of partisan politics. What these arts are, and what is the general quality of those who win by them, we need not say. But it is notorious that men of intelligence, integrity, and character are not successful partisans. It is the intriguers, the wire-pullers, and the crafty, unscrupulous managers in caucus and convention that win, and these men form the state. We do not exaggerate: witness the last Legislature of our own State. Humiliating as it may be to our patriotic pride, every candid person knows it to be a fact that an election under our representative system, with its inevitable caucus and convention machinery, is simply a winnowing out of superior men and the choice of the worst to take the offices of state.
We need not dilate upon the consequences; they are known and read of all men, and the lesson they teach has been freely drawn. If any worthy or meritorious thing is to be done, the significant exclamation is, "In Heaven's name keep it out of politics!" Such, indeed, is the growing disgust with political doings that it is now quixotically proposed to take even office-holding out of politics. And, yet, there are those who would intrust our politicians—ignorant, self-seeking, unscrupulous, and corrupt as the great mass of them are—with the whole work of education in society. Who is so senseless as to look for educational progress in such a condition of things? The system will be turned to the purposes of demagogism as surely as effect follows cause. The management of institutions of learning will become an art of getting state appropriations. The educational system will become rigid in proportion to the extent and complexity of its gradations, and will resist all improvement. Teachers, inspectors, superintendents, become office-holders and stipendiaries under the Government, and all animated with the common purpose of getting their salaries increased. Education, as a function of the states, must become a branch of mercenary politics. And this system, by its vicious growth, and its prestige of authority, and the boundless means at its command, must rival and overcome and extinguish all that private and voluntary interest in the work of education to which we are indebted for the past achievements in this important field of effort. Good may come from state education, but it will not be unmixed good, and it is at least an open question whether the evils of the system, where it is fully carried out, will not be far greater in the long-run than its benefits.
The many American friends of Mr, Herbert Spencer will be pleased to learn that he contemplates visiting this country next year. He has long wished to do so, but has been deterred from seriously thinking about it by the state of his health, which forbade the venture of an Atlantic voyage. But he is now so much better that this difficulty is removed, and he hopes to come over some time next summer.Published on October 12th, 2012 | by Bonnie Getchell2

Not that bad of a day of school. I got 5 hrs of sleep last night and thats this semesters best. I went to my first class, it seems alright and I guess a little hard but its a class I need to graduate. Then I came back and took a nap for 20 mins. Afterwards I went to my other class and there were only 7 people in there and then it turned out there was a note on the door with a new classroom location and we were stupid ones so we went to the new classroom and no one was in there. So after some talking and walking I found out it was canceled because there was only 13 people and you need 15 to have a class. But in that process I made a new friend who lives in my apartment complex and talked to an old aquantance. Then I came back took nap #2 for 15 mins and went to Philosopy of Religion. That class seems really hard but the topic is of great interest so I shall overcome. The teacher is really smart and writes every book he has for his classes. I guess thats an easy way to sell your book. Somewhere in there between classes I went grocery shopping.
The moral of the story, you can do a lot when you wake up early[er]. It seems so long ago when I started the day and went to my first class. I got so much done today and the day is still not over.

Create a LinkWe have certain standards when it comes to our work. Of course we're concerned with how much a job pays, but we also want work that provides fulfillment. We want to know whether the job is hiring in the first place. And we can't forget about security--once hired, are we going to have the chance to find our footing and establish ourselves, or are we going to find that our role has become obsolete?
In the later months of 2012, the U.S. Department of Labor released a series of reports that showed steady, modest growth month over month in job numbers as well as a declining unemployment rate. But when assessing job creation versus employment over a lengthier span, it's troubling to note that this country is still stumbling to offer jobs that workers are qualified to fill. "Employment in the United States is only about 2 percent higher than it was in January of 2000. In that period of time, our work-eligible population has grown by 15 percent. When you look at it that way, there's something awry," says Patrick O'Keefe, the director of economic research at the firm CohnReznick and the former deputy assistant secretary in the U.S. Department of Labor.
In other words, it will take both careful research and preparation to enter any job worth having these days. This is why every year U.S. News gathers a list of the Best Jobs, so that you can assess which occupation could be a good fit, then plan properly to make sure you're qualified to enter it. We base our selections on the Labor Department's predictions of the occupations that should hire abundantly for the next several years. What we've found are 100 jobs spread across six industries where significant hiring is anticipated, either to address the need to expand (such as healthcare) or the need to recoup (such as construction).
Within our 100 best are occupations where the possibility of employment is greater. There are ones where the salary is more competitive, and others where the pay doesn't compare well to the amount of stress you'll face and hours you'll work. That's why we also rank our selections both overall and by industry, to help you better weigh your options.
For each job, we also provide a comprehensive overview that covers the average pay, the training involved, the skills and qualities necessary to have staying power, and the general work environment. Here's a snapshot of what we found.
Salary
Money is almost as important or--in some cases and for some people--more important than a job's responsibilities and purpose. Even those job hunters more concerned about serving the greater good than they are about earning a greater paycheck are still occupied with how to pay bills and meet needs. Salary is such a crucial factor in how we choose a profession that at U.S. News, we gave it a higher weighting this year than it previously had for our 2012 rankings. The difference shows: The average median salary for the 10 jobs that crown our list is $97,403.
All of our picks aren't cash cows, but some of the lower-paying occupations have other important qualities. For instance, a janitor's median salary is $22,370, a telemarketer's is $22,520, and a sports coach earns around $28,370. All three are relatively low-stress positions with flexible schedules that many choose to work part-time.
Our analysis of a job's pay also unveiled a few other interesting trends that could impact your search, like determining what parts of the country pay best. Of course, the Labor Department has found that big cities like San Francisco, New York City, and Washington, D.C., compensate employees well, as does the California metro area of San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara--better known as Silicon Valley. But there are some sleeper cities that also pay top dollar for occupations across industries. Sheboygan, Wis., is one of the top-paying cities for mechanical engineers and insurance agents. Sioux City, Iowa, hosts some very well-paid physical therapists and software developers. Approximately an hour north of San Francisco, Vallejo is a top-paying city for bus drivers, registered nurses, and electricians.

Skills & Training
The "skills gap" is more than a catch phrase. Increasingly, the most coveted positions have a steep learning curve that's coupled with strenuous education requirements before you can even get your first shot at an interview. Our Best Jobs for 2013 are no different. Even those jobs on our list that don't require an associate's, bachelor's, or advanced degree usually make apprenticeship hours and the appropriate licensure a prerequisite.
Take our No. 1 job, dentist, as an example. Starting in high school and continuing on into an undergrad program, a prospective dentist should take science courses like biology and chemistry. They'll need to study hard to pass the Dental Acceptance Test their junior year in college. Admission to an accredited dental school is very competitive, and once they're accepted, they'll spend approximately two years receiving basic technical education plus two years of clinical training. Choosing a specialty like periodontology could tack additional years in a residency program onto training, and then they'll also have to pass a licensing exam.
Conversely, our No. 98 job, general construction worker, has a short on-the-job training period. But those who are choosing to stretch that occupation into a full-fledged career and trade, like as a licensed plumber (No. 73 on this year's list), will need to enter an apprenticeship that could last for up to five years before taking a licensing exam. Or maybe you want to be the one running the construction site? Many construction managers doing just that have a bachelor's degree in building science, architecture, engineering, or a related field. Their occupation is the No. 50 job on our list.
How to Get a Job ... And Keep It
Training is only the half of it. By talking to people who actually work in our top jobs, we were able to specify some of the qualities and characteristics that are also needed to get your foot in the door. Once you're there, those same qualities will also help you excel.
Robert Salinger, a marriage and family therapist (our No. 33 pick), vouches for the importance of having empathy, patience, flexibility, and curiosity in his field. Rachel Gogel, the art director of GQ Advertising, stresses how important it is for other art directors (No. 76) to establish their own brand and develop their own voice/style, to be good networkers, and to remember that learning continues throughout a career. Strong leadership and communication skills plus business acumen could help a budding pharmacist (No. 3), while discipline and focus are paramount to working as a loan officer (No. 65).
[See: What Will the Job Market Look Like in 2020?]
What to Expect
A potential occupation's responsibilities, salary, opportunity, and training are clutch in a job search. But then there are other crucial components that keep us coming to work every day. Are the job's tasks what you expected? Do you have room to broaden your skills and build a career? Are you having trouble setting boundaries between your personal time and professional life? You don't want to accept a job that sounded good in the listing and in the interview, but that then starts to smell funny once you're up close and in the office.
Our tastes in what we like to do and how we like to work are all distinctive, so it's tough to quantify them to determine the better occupations. Still, this year's picks and rankings do take into account the day-to-day of a profession. As an example, Nelly Yusupova, the chief technology officer of Webgrrls International, says workplaces for Web developers run the gamut "from a very flexible, hands on, nimble, 'fly by the seat of your pants' environment of a startup and [being] very involved with every aspect of a project, to a very structured environment with more levels of approval and a more bureaucratic approach with siloed responsibilities." When a Web developer's sometimes fluid, sometimes chaotic work environment was weighed along with the job's competitive salary, unemployment rate, excellent job prospects, and projected growth, the occupation placed ninth on our list of Best Jobs.
By comparison, a restaurant cook (our No. 81 pick) has to consider the tense and hot atmosphere of a commercial kitchen, plus the number of hours and weekends devoted to the work. But on the plus side, they'll also find it's a job with good prospects, plus a decent growth and employment rate.
Here are the top 10 jobs of 2013:
1. Dentist
2. Registered Nurse
3. Pharmacist
4. Computer Systems Analyst
5. Physician
6. Database Administrator
7. Software Developer
8. Physical Therapist
9. Web Developer
10. Dental Hygienist

Today, Professor Philip Alston, the UN Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial executions, released a statement calling for any Israeli inquiry into the flotilla incident to be set up in accordance with international standards. He stated that for the inquiry.
PRESS STATEMENT of the UN Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial executions
To be credible, Israeli Inquiry must be given the capacity to find the facts, says UN expert
11 June 2010:
“Any inquiry set up by Israel to investigate the Gaza flotilla incident must be given a genuine capacity to find the facts”, according to Philip Alston, the UN’s independent expert on extrajudicial executions. “Without that capacity, an inquiry will simply not be considered credible,” he said. Alston noted that, “there are several indispensable requirements for any such commission of inquiry to comply with international standards. First, it must be independent of the government. Second it must be given full legal authority to obtain direct access to all relevant evidence, including the key witnesses. And third, its final report must be made public and not left to the discretion of the Government.” Alston said that if these requirements are met, a domestic commission of inquiry can make an important contribution to resolving the human rights issues raised by the raid on the flotilla.
Alston noted that he was basing his comments on conclusions drawn from his previous detailed study on the international standards for inquiries, and on his investigations and reports to the UN on killings and accountability issues in countries around the world. (See A/HRC/8/3).
“Giving the commission the capacity to find the facts means that it must.”
“I will continue to closely monitor the development and progress of any inquiry,” the expert said. “It is crucial for the credibility of the inquiry that its processes be transparent and open, and that its report is released in full.”

And, Israeli puppet nations will have no difficulty at all in affirming that they have done so to their satisfaction.

Charade, sham, farce!Research

As the newest of the State Universities to achieve to this status (and one of only four to do so), FIU now stand in the ranks of the nation's elite research universities. Housed in an urban university in a global city at the cutting edge of the 21st century change, the Psychology Department's goal is to maintain the strong basic science orientation (and methodological rigor) that parallels the core basic science orientation that is the backbone of the discipline while drawing on the strengths and resources that are uniquely available in Southeast Florida to address the issues in an urban and multicultural region of the state.
The Psychology Department's Research Labs and Programs are at the core of our strivings for outstanding teaching and cutting edge research. They provide the means by which faculty can continue to accomplish the research that has contributed to the Department’s growing national and international recognition as a research department of first rank and to the Department’s substantial contribution to the development of innovative programs for knowledge development in both the basic and applied arenas. Additionally, they provide the means by which both undergraduate and graduate students in psychology obtain direct hands-on experience in both the basic and applied arenas of psychology.Fashion an antique shopping trip to Sebastopol, I found this book from 1939 — Fashion Drawing: How to Do It. It's pretty wonderful. And though I'm not an artist and can't draw, it's certainly a great resource for learning about fashion terms and methods (like how to draw fabric prints).

Very interesting!
Oh waw! As a graphic designer and seamstress I’ve been very interested in fashion drawing. There are so many styles in it! Of course I’m crazy about the fashion drawings from the fifties.
And jeesh! I can’t imagine making a repeatable pattern for a fabric print by hand! I couldn’t do that without my faithful computer. Kuddos to the people who used to do this all by hand.
wow, wow, wow! That is such a neat book!! Great find!
Wow, that’s amazingly neat! I love sketching out (and occasionally painting up) my ideas, especially when I’m still trying to hash out exactly what I want from a project. I wish I was as good as that illustrator, though… I second Kathleen! :)
I am jealous :) What a great find!
What a great find! I’m totally jealous. That kind of illustration just can’t be done on a computer. Don’t get me wrong, I think Illustrator is great and I even took a class in fashion illustration using Illustrator, but it just isn’t the same as what this book describes.
Back in the mid-1990s, when I was about 10 years old, I spent a lot of time with a fashion design student who taught me the very basics of what she was learning (industry proportions, colouring and shading). She gave me a lot of her drafts and I copied her by meticulously tracing them. Let me tell you, the style and the techniques were nothing like this. :)
Oooooh, what a find! Very jealous :o)
What a cool book! I’m always amazed at how you can almost feel the fabric, just by looking at the pattern illustrations: this one is velvet, that one is seersucker, etc.
I have that book! :) I bought it when I was 19 (one of my first Ebay purchases ;) and still love looking through it and studying things. Such a neat look back at another aspect of dressmaking and fashion.Welcher, Dan

Exact Matching Concepts from Other SchemesAge Discrimination Lawsuit Leaves Wounds In Seniors-Only Retirement Haven.
Ryderwood started as a timber company town. When the loggers pulled out in the early 1950s, an enterprising developer converted the entire six block by six block village into a retirement haven. Now Ryderwood could serve as a social science Petri dish to study bitterness, division and healing.
At the town's volunteer-run café, peals of laughter echo around a table of silver-haired regulars gathered for morning coffee. The happy mood is a positive sign say patrons.
Bea McKim: "It's pretty much back to good like this town should be." Cheryl Pearce: "It's happily over. We went through five years of hell."
What Pearce refers to is a recently settled federal lawsuit. It challenged the essence of Ryderwood, that only retirees aged 55 or older can buy homes there. McKim and Pearce wanted to maintain the status quo. Resident Chris Wiegner agrees and still doesn't understand how this turned into a costly lawsuit.
Wiegner: "Why? Why? Why move to a nice, quiet beautiful place and then want to change it?"
But 54 townspeople did want to change it and signed on to the age discrimination lawsuit. It was around the height of the housing crisis and some of the plaintiffs wanted to be able to sell their Ryderwood homes to whomever they wanted. For others, like Gloria Leach and her husband, it was more about standing up to perceived shortcomings by the homeowners association, which enforces the 55 and older bylaw.
Leach: "All I wanted was truth. But it did go longer than we thought. A couple of times we thought about dropping out. Very expensive."
And divisive. The lawsuit pitted neighbor against neighbor. Mountains of court documents detail grandmas and grandpas behaving badly. There's alleged harassment, retaliation, intimidation, tire slashing, nasty emails and hurled insults. The challengers claim they were made unwelcome at church and the community café.
Leach: "We were shunned. I could understand that they were very disappointed in the actions that we were taking."
The litigation lasted so long that some of those who challenged the age restriction died before it was resolved. Leach is just glad it is finally over.
Leach: "We have some people that are very hostile and bitter and carrying on. I keep reminding them that life is too short for this. My favorite saying is, 'Let go, let God.'"
On the other side, resident Chris Wiegner says she did her best to behave honorably. In her assessment, "it's going to take a long time to get over this."
Wiegner: "It was a dumb thing, but people get into these fixed ideas. Here you are, you're spending the last years of your life and health, the last years of your money on what? Stupidity."
The homeowners group - the Ryderwood Improvement and Service Association - has a relatively new leader who is trying to play the role of peacemaker. Denny Knight says the settlement reached this spring preserves the town's 55-and-older bylaw. Ryderwood's insurance company paid off some of the debts accumulated during the litigation on both sides.
Knight: "Our attorneys pointed out - and even the judge pointed out - that a settlement would be the best method all the way around. Nobody is 100 percent happy, but the winner is the town. We can put this behind us."
The more than five years of arguing changed no policies to speak of observed Knight. The little village at the end of the highway can go on proclaiming itself as the nation's original seniors-only retirement community.
An unusually large number of Ryderwood houses are now for sale. The majority of those listings belong to people who initiated the unsuccessful lawsuit.
One the first litigants to move away was Janice Bigley. She and her husband withdrew from the group of town critics and resettled in Tumwater, Washington. Bigley partly attributes the move to the ill will among neighbors. "When we withdrew, we were ostracized," she explained during a short telephone interview.Broncos

I can judge only by films and TV broadcasts so I might be wrong but it seems to me that the only racism is being denounced is the one voiced from a white person or persons. If white man will say "you fucking nigger" it will cause a great condemnation whereas racist expressions by black people are being tolerated and everybody perceive it easy and just give a smile on it. It seems to me that in black areas it is even demand to be racist towards white people(if you're black) and in those areas whites are not welcomed and there's a big feasibility to get punched or plundered if you are white but I've never heard that black person should be afraid in areas where the majority of people are whites. Is it truth what I'm talking about? And should there be any arrangements against it? Your opinions please!Hello

JohnFirst year: 1910
Extirpated year:
Established status: Populations are confirmed breeding and apparently self-sustaining for 10 or more consecutive years.
Estimated Florida range: 52 counties At least 10 years, 5 counties Less than 10 years
Statewide trend: Declining
Threats to natives: None known.
Species Account: The native range of this species primarily encompasses coastal regions from western India and Somali around both sides of the Mediterranean Basin to Spain, Morocco, and the Canary Islands (Conant and Collins 1991), but it has been widely introduced. It may reach a total length of 12.7 cm (5 in) but is usually smaller. It has prominent tubercles on the head, body, legs, and tail. During the day, these geckos are brownish to gray colored with darker, irregular dorsal markings, but they lighten up to a light gray, pinkish ivory, or pasty white color at night and may lack markings. They are most often seen on the walls or ceilings of buildings at night, often feeding on insects around lights. The males can make weak, squeaking noises and are territorial (Bartlett and Bartlett 1999). The Mediterranean gecko was once locally common in the Lower Florida Keys (Duellman and Schwartz 1958) but has been almost completely replaced by the tropical house gecko (Meshaka et al. 1994). In southern mainland Florida, the Mediterranean gecko has been mostly replaced by the tropical house gecko and Indo-Pacific gecko (Butterfield et al. 1993, Meshaka 1994, Meshaka et al. 1994a). The decline in distribution and abundance of the Mediterranean gecko in southern Florida may be due to competition with other recently established and rapidly dispersing geckos that are more fecund because of continuous reproduction, unlike the seasonal reproductive cycle of the Mediterranean gecko (Meshaka 1994a, Meshaka et al. 1994a, Meshaka 1995). The scattered and haphazard pattern of colonization is often associated with man-assisted transport along trucking routes (Davis 1974, Godley et al. 1981, Meshaka 1995).
Habitats: Central or core urban area, Low density suburban development, areas peripheral to core urban areas, and small towns

- Filed Under
To close out its 2013 summer season, Southern Appalachian Repertory Theatre has reached way back and conjured up an old-school comedy classic in Noel Coward's "Blithe Spirit," about a restless spook summoned back to the English home of her former husband.
First performed as an escapist piece in the dark days of World War II, it has many hallmarks of old-school theater. Much has changed about humor since then, but the situation is timeless and SART's production greatly benefits from a strong and experienced cast, directed by Julie Richardson, who has combined the original three acts into ...Okay, we know that The Lord of the Rings movies were long, especially with the extended versions, but Peter Jackson still managed to keep each single book down to a single corresponding film. So why, then, can he not even fit The Hobbit into two movies, but has to make it three? I have a few theories.
Note: many of these theories have now officially been confirmed by Peter Jackson as elements that he is specifically looking into in the creation of the third Hobbit film. The Necromancer’s rise, the Battle Dol Guldur, and more on Gandalf’s part in the tale were all brought up in the link provided. Speculation time!
1) The Necromancer
In the book, we don’t get to see where Gandalf goes off to when he abandons Thorin and Company on the edge of Mirkwood, but we know from the LotR appendices and some of Tolkien’s notes that the wizard left to lead an assault upon the Necromancer in his lair at Dol Guldur, in the heart of Mirkwood. Mirkwood wasn’t always called Mirkwood, after allit used to be Greenwood the Great, and it was only after the Necromancer’s arrival and the result of his influence there that the elves renamed the forest Mirkwood. That was when it became the dangerous place that the dwarves and Bilbo had to travel through.
We’ve seen clips in the trailer of Gandalf wandering carefully through some creepy gray stone ruins, and one has to assume that there will be a big confrontation between him and the Necromancer. (Possibly in the tradition of that epic Gandalf v. Saruman smackdown in Fellowship? Or something even more terrifying?) The fact that Benedict Cumberbatch is playing Smaug makes it logical to cast him in another voice-acting role within the movie (just as John Rhys-Davies played Gimli and voiced Treebeard) but once you have that voice and that talent, why not use it to its fullest? Will we see only one scene with the Necromancer, or will there be several? Is the scene we’ve glimpsed in the trailer that first time Gandalf snuck into Dol Guldur (no one knew who the Necromancer really wasalthough the Wise suspected it was one of the Nazguluntil Gandalf snuck in and discovered that it was actually Sauron) and is it possible that we may also see the battle itself, with all the strength of the elves and wizards thrown against the growing shadow of Sauron?
2) The White Council
That being said, it seems likely that some aspect of rising of Sauron plot line will be explored. Obviously, Hugo Weaving is reprising his role as Elrond, since the dwarves stay at Rivendell “The Last Homely House,” in The Hobbit, but we also know that we will see Galadriel and Saruman, both members of The White Council, as well as Sylvester McCoy as Radgast the Brown whoas a wizard of Gandalf’s orderwas probably also part of the council. Sadly, there is no casting of Círdan to confirm my suspicions, but it still seems pretty likely.
There is so much opportunity for exploring and foreshadowing The Lord of the Rings here that was never included in the actual story of The Hobbit, because Tolkien was adding all his foreshadowing and tie-ins retroactively (i.e. the changes he made to the riddle game once he decided that Bilbo’s magic ring should be the through-line of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings). But Jackson’s movie-going audience has already watched The Lord of the Rings, and now gets to travel back in time, so to speak. We’re ravenous for those details, those ironic hints of the story we know is to come. Remember how the trailer ends, with Gollum hovering over Bilbo in an all too familiar way, and that perfect shot of the ring?
3) Lazy Lob and Crazy Cob
While The Lord of the Rings is a war story, The Hobbit is really just a questing story, and it is likely that Peter Jackson will want to give each adventure Bilbo has along his way a good amount of screen time. The incident with the spiders in Mirkwood could, of course, be cut down or even out to save time in the film, but it’s also good enough to be given as much attention as Bilbo’s encounters with Smaug or the final battle in Lake Town. Indeed, I enjoyed most of Bilbo’s adventures more than that battle, which in some ways seemed to be a convenient manner of getting everyone to stop arguing about gold and end the trek with the proper battle these stories usually have. It might be wonderful to spend a full half hour just watching the dwarves try to navigate Mirkwood, and another forty minutes in the Elvenking’s hall watching the dwarves be stubborn and the Elves get drunk… but then again, that will start to make the movies pretty long, pretty quickly. Jackson’s audience is used to long stories, however, and he has shown that he’s not one for leaving out the details.
4) Tauriel, Daughter of the Forest
Tolkien’s works are rich in pretty much everything except female characters, but at least The Lord of the Rings had Arwen and Eowyn, whose roles could beand, in Arwen’s case, wereexpanded upon in places to give these ladies more to do. Not so in The Hobbit, so Peter Jackson is adding a whole new character, Tauriel. We don’t know much about her besides the fact that she is from Mirkwood and will be played by Evangeline Lilly, but Peter Jackson wouldn’t add a brand new female character without giving her a full story, so she probably is going to be doing more than arresting dwarves in Mirkwood or following Gandalf to the battle with the Necromancer.
5) The Story of Gandalf
It is one thing to have Frodo know Gandalf as an old family friend, which, at that point, he was. But how did Bilbo come to know Gandalf in the first place, and, more importantly, what was it in Bilbo that caught Gandalf’s eye? In the book, the wizard is known in Hobbiton, but hasn’t been seen for a long timeBilbo does remember the fireworks and Gandalf’s stories, and Gandalf clearly knew Bilbo’s mother. Although I doubt there will be much exploration into that old family history, there is a tie between the two of them that could be explored.
Jackson also seems to be establishing something of a connection between Galadriel and Gandalf. It’s only a flash in the trailer, but the sadness in his face as she lifts her hand to touch him seems very vulnerable, and very personal. In The Unfinished Tales it is suggested that the wizards are basically angels, beings called Maiar sent by the Valar (the gods) to help and protect Middle-Earth. Sauron and Saruman were two of these, both fallen eventually to evil. What is it about Gandalf that sets him apart, and what does Galadriel know about him? Círdan was said to be the only elf who knew who the wizards really were, but given the audience’s previous knowledge of Galadriel and her position in The Lord of the Rings films as the one who sees the farthest and knows the most, it would make sense if she carried this knowledge in film-verse.
Of course, there are lots of other options for scenes to fill up the movie. Will we spend an hour following the goblins around their caves in the Misty Mountains? Will Elrond finally lose his temper with his know-it-all mother-in-law, Galadriel? Will we actually get to see a hobbit eat second breakfast? Let me know what you think in the comments below!

They are in order, from L to R: Sephora Makeup Base ($12), Laura Geller's Spackle Trio ($30), Rimmel's Dare to Bare Luminizer ($7), and Revlon's Skinlights in "Buff/Chamoise" ($7-10).
I have used the Smashbox Photo Finish Primer, and I like it, I mean most primers do the same thing, it's like moisturizer so you can't go wrong with which one you choose. I also tried the Laura Mercier's Makeup Primer and it worked well too. The only reason I really like Laura Geller's Spackle Trio is because it's a trio, it has the primer, lip, AND eye primer. But she also carries the FULL SIZE makeup primer.
I really like the Sephora Makeup Base, not only because the price can't be beat (at $12), but because it smells really nice and has pink pearlescent beads to brighten your skin.
EDIT!!!
I forgot to mention that I also bought Sonia Kushuk's "blending brush", which belnds different colored eyeshadows (since I wear more than one shade), and I love it, it has loose bristles to give a nice effect.
thanks nessa for the post! :] i think i'll go pick up that rimmel luminizer and i was thinking about picking up the sephora make-up base... but i think you may have sold me so i probably will do so now. haha. :]
now i'm even considering the skinlights one too! haha. my boyfriend is wondering why i'm spending so much on make-up now! LOL. he's like, "gosh! you have so many different make-ups already... why are you buying so much?" and i'm like, "because i'm behind and i have to update, and i'm finding out about SO MANY good finds from my friend and make-up is fun."

Last night in NYC, Lena Dunham joined the ladies of "Girls" for their Season 2 premiere party, Sofia Coppola came out to support her brother, Roman Coppola, at the NY screening of his new film "A Glimpse Inside the Mind of Charles Swan III," Fern Mallis kicked off her 2013 interview series with Marc Jacobs, and so much more!Anyone who came to WoW after playing FPS knows that the one thing missing is BG or RBG style Kills to win match. Could you imagine the insane battle fronts of players teaming up to slaughter each other over and over(or until 50 kills). I mean really that is what most BG's are with a few people actually trying to accomplish winning parameters. Hopefully this gets some response because I have talked to allot of people in game who thinks this would be a great idea.

Still Recovering from a Devastating Bout with Throat Cancer Sammy Davis Jr. Finds New Gratitude for Life and for Friends
Looking back now, Davis remembers the evening as the end of a triumphant period and the start of a tumultuous one. The following morning, the 64-year-old veteran entertainer awoke with a strange soreness in his throat that would eventually be traced to a carcinoma growing behind his vocal cords. "People are afraid of the word cancer," says Davis, "so doctors use medical terms like carcinoma." Thus began a descent into pain, a grueling passage through radiation treatments that left Davis's skin discolored and so raw it sometimes bled when he touched his throat.
Yet at the bottom of pain he found victory. After eight weeks of radiation, ending last month, doctors say the cancer is in remission. And Davis, after 60 years in show business, is back in America's spotlight. On Sunday, Feb. 4, ABC will air Sammy Davis Jr.'s 60th Anniversary Celebration, a 2½-hour special in which many of Davis's friends salute the courage of the country's coolest cat. Featuring Eddie Murphy, Michael Jackson, Frank Sinatra and others, the show delivers a powerful lineup of stars offering the most glowing, heartfelt tribute this TV season.
The road back was a tough one. Davis faced the very real possibility that he would never sing again—if, indeed, he survived at all. "All the time I was wondering, will it come back, will the throat come back, and if it does, what level will you get to? How will you perform?" he remembers. Though he's still able to talk only in a hoarse whisper, the man once known as Mr. Entertainment says singing is definitely not out of the question. "I haven't tried to find out yet whether I could sing, get a note, nothing. Shirley [MacLaine]—who is one of my godmothers, she's always there when I need her—she's got a vocal guy I'm going to work with. I've got to find out from this guy. If he says not to perform, I'll do what he says." Facing a previously scheduled date for Harrah's in April, he'll be relying on all the advice he can get. "I don't know the reason for my surviving, and I'm not going to press God to know why," he says. "I'm going to let Him guide me, instead of me trying to run the show."
In the meantime Davis is concentrating on what he has gained from the experience. Forced to put another brake on his frenetic life-style (when diagnosed, he broke his 50-year, pack-and-a-half-a-day cigarette habit), Davis credits his illness with putting him in touch with his mortality and making him realize the value of friends. "You gotta think about it and say, why did this happen, there's gotta be a reason. God had a reason for making me go through this, to let me know that people care for me as a human being."
Just how much they cared was evident last fall when word of his illness was announced. Construction workers outside his doctor's office yelled their encouragement. Fans from around the world wrote to say they were thinking of him, praying for him and even lighting candles for him. "It was such an outpouring, it was unbelievable," he says. "I tried to write cards and thank you notes..." Davis's voice chokes with a sob. "A hundred letters a day is a lot of mail, you know, for somebody who ain't got a hit series or hit records."
The response from his friends was even more direct. "If you're going to be sick and not sure about the future of your life, it's pretty nice to have someone who loves you," he says. Sitting in the spacious den of his Beverly Hills home, where he lives with Altovise and their adopted 13-year-old son, Manny, Davis again fights back the tears. "Frank [Sinatra] said, 'You've got the plane. You're going to Sloan-Kettering.' [Bill] Cosby calls: 'I'm sending the plane for you. There's a guy in Paris.' Jerry [Lewis] wants to turn the medical community upside down for me. Dr. [Michael] DeBakey is calling, talking to my wife. You try to make a joke about it, but you know where their heads are, where their hearts are," he says. "I got some calls from people I never expected to hear from: 'I'll send you a blank check. You fill in, whatever you need.' "
Some pals dropped by the house. "One day I looked up," says Davis, "and there was Liza. She said, 'I've got my bags and I'm staying.' She stayed for four days, just to be with me." Singer Steve Lawrence came to visit almost every day. "We've been friends for 30, 35 years," says Lawrence. "He'd be talking in this little tiny whisper. You could barely hear him. He was really wiped out. So I told him a few jokes and tried to cheer him up, kinda like a wife. Sammy's the kind of guy who used to live a 25-hour day. So he's slowed up a little, but I'm sure he's going to get back to his old form soon."
The biggest display of affection from his friends, however, came last November during the ABC taping of next week's special, in which 26 stars turned out to render him honor. "Sammy was out there before any black star, paving the way, and they wanted to pay tribute to him," explains George Schlatter, who produced the show, a benefit for the United Negro College Fund. Whitney Houston, one of the show's guests, says, "He helped to break down the color barriers, to not be judged solely by the color of our skin, but by the content of our character. I think he fought the battle for the rest of us."
And for a man who lost an eye in a near-fatal 1954 auto accident, managed to dance again after two hip replacement operations in 1984 and '85 and made his way from a Harlem tenement to the White House, racial discrimination was only one of many battles fought during his career. Still, even Davis found his courage tested during the cancer treatment. His doctors gave him a choice of three options. "They said it could be treated with chemotherapy, surgery or radiation," he says. "I didn't want to go through chemo, your hair falling out and feeling so sick. And I didn't want surgery either. Even Schweitzer makes mistakes."
The radiation also had frightening side effects. His weight dropped from 109 to 92 lbs. (he considers 110 lbs. about right for his 5'5" frame), his throat was raw, and he couldn't find the energy to crawl out of bed after a day of radiation therapy. For inspiration he turned to friend Charles Bronson, whose wife, Jill Ireland, had been battling cancer long before Davis. "I had so much admiration for her, and for him, and the dignity with which they carry themselves," he says. "That's what came into my mind when the doctors told me about my throat cancer, the dignity. There are only two things that count in show business—know when to get on and when to get off. Don't sit there with your head in your hand and all that. Try to walk out with a little dignity."
Davis found another source of strength during his third week of treatment, when he ran across a cancer-stricken child in the hospital corridor. "I looked at this little boy, he must have been about 7 years old, he had no hair, he had no legs, and here I am complaining about what by comparison was nothing but a minor inconvenience," he says. "From that day on, I think, I stopped feeling sorry for myself."
For the future Davis remains optimistic that the cancer won't reappear. He's pleased to point out that the radiation burn across his throat has turned to soft, fresh new skin. "Like baby skin," he says. And although he still tires easily, his doctors reassure him that in time he'll regain his strength. Of course, if his voice rebounds, the third leg of the Frank, Sammy and Liza tour—performing in Mexico and the Orient—is left to complete. But Davis insists he won't sing unless he feels he can do it well. "I know I've got the people's good graces for two engagements, but after that, you better sing or get the hell off the stage," he says. "I don't want sympathy bits. I'm just lucky to be alive at least, even if I never sing again." But he's not ready to give up on the idea entirely. "God took me through the worst part of my life, and I'm sitting here today," he says. "He'll let me know."

PromotionNEW YORK — Two sources familiar with the race for attorney general say that Onondaga County Comptroller Bob Antonacci will back Staten Island DA Dan Donovan for the office, after a floor vote.
It’s unclear whether Antonacci will gain the 25 percent of weighted delegates to secure a spot on the primary ballot — he was confident when we spoke yesterday — but in previous interviews has always expressed an interest in doing what’s best for the party. He had previously told me he would not petition his way onto the ballot.
In recent days, Donovan’s support has surged. He was also nominated for the office by the Conservative Party last week.
This means the GOP will not have a primary for attorney general. Primaries are expected in the race for governor and U.S. Senate seats.

What does the MESH in MESH Cities stand for? We've answered that question for the editors of Spacing Magazine in a short essay for spacingtoronto.ca. It is published today. Here is how it is explained:
Whatever you might think about a computer-driven modernity, MESH Cities are not just smart cities. MESH Cities go beyond the management of infrastructure to the heart of what makes cities worthwhile—their livability. Metaphorically, MESH Cities are the offspring of an improbable marriage between Jane Jacobs and ubiquitous city computing. Their kids, in this context, are named MESH: M=Mobile, E=Efficient, S=Subtle, H=Heuristics
The term is one our editor, Robert Ouellette, coined, but it is influenced by researchers and practitioners going back to Teilhard de Chardin's ideas about the Noosphere, Buckminster Fuller's synergetics, and many, many others. We would also like to thank our colleagues at Toronto's Mesh Conference for their exploration of all topics related to how the Net changes things.
Here is a further elaboration of the acronym:
MOBILE: Mobile devices and the networks that support them are the essential ingredient to the mix. They provide the bottom-up, real-time information conduit that informs us what is right or wrong about our city. MIT's SENSEable City Lab graph of the real-time use of mobile devices in Rome for the 2006 Venice Biennale seen above illustrates how much information is being generated at a given moment.. Any system adopted by city administrators must not overwhelm city users. In fact, the more invisible and non-intrusive a system is the better it will serve its. This is the major reason why there has been an exponential shift in the speed of city design, especially in emerging economies where existing infrastructure does not get in the way. What are your thoughts on MESH Cities? Let us know.."
Bravo President Obama! You will never get a even break from the corporate media monopoly (judging from the right wing talking points being spewed in these comments). So just do the job. Do it well. Do it right. Be honest and do your best to make sure those around you are honest too. Just a thought, if you kept the Bills short (like 5 pages) and you made sure that the language was simple (stupifyingly so), it would help with the transparency issues and no politician in Washington would have an excuse for not having had the time to read a Bill all the way through. Keep up the good work, and reach out to the left as much as you reach out to the right. May God Bless.
A crushing indictment of the Obama administration. Who says the GOP news media lacks substance?
I always liked the stories of Jimmy Carter sneaking out of the White House and going fishing. Nobody knew (I bet Rosalyn did). I'll bet there's an unmarked government Taurus stashed around there somewhere for burger runs...
What about cash? I always hear stories about Presidents never having cash, since they can't ever go shopping, anyway. Is there a 'mad money' box in the Oval Office?
To Derek.I have $400.00 shoes.Whats wrong with that? did you pay for them??
i didnt think so!
What a great leader who knows how to mix with ordinary people during a fun-time lunch. We are living again, America! Radiance!
So many of you criticize Obama and make inferences that McCain made during the campaign, but it did not win McCain votes. The ugly comments of GOP folks is not going to endear Americans.
For all of those who are constantly criticizing the President. Can you tell us anything good that GW did while in office for 8 years???
Didn't think so. He was a big joke around the world, or didn;t you notice that either? Didn't think so.
Wow, shouldn't these guys be working? I mean, I didn't vote for him to eat burgers. Seriously, he should be fixing our problems right now. In fact, he shouldn't eat, sleep, or even take a bathroom break until the economy completely turns around... Honestly, the people who criticize people for going out for lunch are just people who are looking for anything to criticize. I know people will disagree on some things, me included. But eating lunch certainly isn't one of them. Sheesh. It's not like he's on vacation or anything. That being said, whether or not you agree with his policies, you have to admit that he has done a lot in a short span of time. Hopefully it will all turn out for the better.
Barack and Joe are great. Stopping for a burger like two regular people. I can't imagine Bush and Cheney ever doing something normal like that.
Why aren't these two bums working on cutting spending and shrinking the size of government? Oh they're communists, I almost forgot. Have a burger fat boy.
Man of the sheeple:
In case you haven't noticed, before Obama (and even Bush with the original stimulus) businesses were failing left and right. So, to say stay out of business, is asking Obama to ignore the economy (like Bush the majority of his terms). This is what caused the great depression – a laissez e faire president who thought any government involvement in business was wrong. Well, if these businesses fail and everyone loses their jobs, it IS a government problem. The way OBama's handling it is preventing this situation, and restoring our economy to have somethign LEFT for our grandchildren. In addition, he's for investing in things that will grow our country to be free of foreign oil and have investment in our country that will put us on more stable ground in the future.
gee! wow! oh bama and biden stopped for burgers! this is riiculous.
What should you care if he stop to buy 50 pair shoes. Remember Obama and Michelle had money before they got to the White House. What they do with it is their business. Get a life and if the United States do prosper then I guess we can call you a free loader I think you live on this planet and everyone wins if this United States do prosper.
It was nice to hear that our President can relate to the real working people of the US and did not expect a free lunch.
Well i see the 21% of the republican party are out with their nasty remarks. This just goes to show you how nasty it will be when the elections roll around but by that time there will only be 15% of them around.
This is great. Dangerous, but its very cool. Welcome to the little people Obama.
I have to say I just feel pity for Repulicans now.
They are one sad pathetic group of individuals.
A Religious Right that wallows in hate, fear and bitterness. Lovely eh?? All of Jesus teachings in one neat bunch.
Don't you just love our president! This is so kool to be a part of his everyday. We love you Michelle and Barack. Those folk here haten, are just weak and sad you lost. I'm glad I didnt have to relocate to Canada – that would have been an option if Sarah and John would have had the audacity....but we have theAudacity of Hope now, . And yes its amazing and yes its a peaceful slow day, and yes we get a little good news. The man and his crew Hi JOE! IS TAKING CARE OF BUSINESS. GOD BLESS THEM.
people are gonna do what they do.....pass laws, marry each other, do whatever because they have a choice. I make mine and you make yours. I voted for Obama, and look at the things he is doing. Many of you cant deal with him accomplishing so much. Its ok...you are on for the ride too, enjoy. He is your president too.
Now whats your choice activity this week, watch Michelle and President Obama's date video or drive to Alaska to listen to Britol Palin at her town meeting. Mmmm. Ok push play...................
Jenny,
Don't want likeable and popular.
Want competent.
Very nice!!! It is amazing to see the world's president living and eating among us! I am so happy that we have a president that we can respect and feel totally comfortable with for once! Such a role model for the upcoming generation.
The angry-GOP comments are pretty funny. They seem hellbent to whine about anything and everything Obama does. They seem to have conveniently forgotten the horrible disaster of the Bush years.
Nice!!! Now get back to work we don't want to make REPUBS mad!!! hehe
Please tell me that they were not riding in the same car!

Did he stop to pick up some $600 sneakers for MIchelle?
Um no...but possibly stopped to pick up some 485,000 dinnerware. Oh wait. That was the last guy.
Now that is what you call down to earth regular guys. The president does noy have to regal, blue blooded but a regular person who knows what it is like to be real.This site provides Data Portal access through the the first quarter of 2015. In early 2015, the

The killing of feral cats is so much more than a simple legal question and answer. It may be legal when protecting your property, such as feral cats engaged in the taking of your livestock or even pets. Taking a feral cat in the wilds of Idaho would require a valid hunting license.
However, there are other considerations to keep in mind:
Are you in a city limit that prohibits the discharge of a firearm? Does the county have a no shooting safety ordinance for your neighborhood?
Is the cat actually Feral, or has Muffy escaped their yard and the 8 year old owner out looking for their pet kitty?
It is impossible to provide a definitive answer to this question without knowing the specifics to your circumstance. And Fish and Game may not be the source for that definitive or even the specific instance knowing that each city and each county may have other provisions and therefore other solutions for removing the pesky cat in your yard. Other solutions could also include contacting your local Animal Shelter for assistnace."On vacations, at school graduations, and on Christmas mornings, it was usually just my mother, my father, my brother and me. Our tribe of four made us seem alternately special and forsaken, the last survivors of a dying colony or the founding members of an exclusive club. We were fragile. We were definitive. We were the platonic ideals of father, mother, daughter, son."
And so it seemed, and so it was -- the Broyards were a successful, artistic family, and a loving one. But like most families, the Broyards had a share of secrets. New York Times literary critic Anatole Broyard's most closely held secret, that he was of mixed race, was widely known among some of his acquaintances, but his daughter Bliss and his son Todd only learned this shortly before his death in 1990.
No longer able to fit that platonic ideal within that small frame, Bliss Broyard set out to enlarge her sense of family, her sense of self, and yes, her sense of history.
Her new book, "One Drop: My Father's Hidden Life -- A Story of Race and Family Secrets" (Little, Brown, $24.99), chronicles her search for her father's family, a search that brought her to New Orleans time and again. Anatole Broyard was born here, July 16, 1920, at 2524 St. Ann St., and members of her family have scattered throughout the country in their 250-year history in America.
Bliss Broyard, also the author of a collection of short stories, "My Father, Dancing," devoted seven years to "One Drop."
"It alternated between feeling like I was writing a seventh-grade history primer and a Ph.D. dissertation," she said by phone from her home in Brooklyn. "It was, to date, the biggest intellectual, emotional and creative challenge I've had. I was starting from scratch learning about New Orleans history and African-American history. I didn't know what Reconstruction was. It was amazing to me how much of this history is not familiar to people.
"I had to educate myself. If you're a popular historian, someone like Stephen Ambrose, you can find the most compelling story. But I had a cast of characters given to me."
Broyard traced those historical characters back to Etienne, the first Broyard to come to America in the late 1850s, to the "moment of mixing" when Bliss Broyard's great-great-great-grandfather Henry Broyard, who was white, married Pauline Bonnee, and both were registered as free people of color.
That history has given way to a living, breathing set of relatives with whom Broyard feels a strong sense of connection.
"There are three different branches of the family in New Orleans," Broyard said. "We're all going to get together Tuesday night at my cousin Sheila Prevost's house. The 10 of us will probably eat red beans and rice and fried chicken. I sent copies to everybody who's in the book, and some of them have read it."
Broyard did most of her research in the city between 2000 and 2003, guided by such friends as local historian Keith Weldon Medley, author of "We As Freemen: Plessy v. Ferguson," who owned the guesthouse where she was staying and could serve as a willing guide to Creole culture.
Broyard ran along the levee, worked in New Orleans archives, listened to the music, went to Carnival celebrations such as the Bunch Club Ball and the Plantation Revelers Ball, experienced that fluid sense of identity as performance that is such a strong aspect of New Orleans life.
Broyard developed a deep attachment to the city.
"I feel really privileged, really grateful," she said. "This whole project has been driven by a real desire to reclaim my ancestral city, now more than ever."
Post-Katrina, she experienced that same sense of loss, as her family was scattered to different parts of the country.
"Some lived in New Orleans East, but some have come back," she said. "Sheila's grandmother Rose is in Georgia, and she's trying to get one of her daughters to read the book aloud to her."
After all that exploration comes the writer's hoped-for reward: understanding.
"People are picking up on things I really hoped would come through," Broyard said. "The definition of blackness has been imposed by social and political forces, and the reality it played in people's lives, the real consequential nature of the color line, can be a subtle, difficult point. 'Race is a social construction' -- when you hear that, it sounds academic, it doesn't make much sense. But I've heard from tons of people who have similar stories, that they, too, found out as an adult and are seeking their hidden African ancestors."
On the emotional journey, with all its landmark stops at love, anger, curiosity, admiration, Broyard finds some understanding and sympathy within herself.
"It's interesting. There are those who have such a strong opinion about my dad: 'He should have said he was this, or that.' And that makes me way more sympathetic to my dad. . . .
"Most of my parents' friends were writers and artists, who would be on the side of humanistic individualism. They would say he had a right to identify himself as he chose. Why would he choose to identify himself as black when this might deny him opportunity? But some people couldn't see the tax that it had on him. He isolated himself in his family, would talk around the subject but never really directly. But he kept revisiting his family in his fiction. People didn't see the sense of loss or desire for recovery that he suffered from.
"Then there are those people who wondered why in the '80s or '90s, he didn't just come out with it. They don't know how much he thought of himself as keeping it a secret -- and from his kids, he was -- and it had taken on more importance because it had been kept secret for so long."
And, of course, Bliss Broyard never had that all-important conversation with her father.
"We never had a chance to talk about it. How could he have explained it in a way that wouldn't compromise himself?" she asked. "There's a very thin line between self-preservation and selfishness and he straddled that line."
During the course of writing the book, Broyard had her first child, now 15-month-old Esme.
"I told my editor I should have gotten pregnant years ago," she said, laughing. "That's one deadline you really can't miss. But it made me feel even more of a desire to claim my own history. It's my responsibility to keep this continuum going. What do I know, what am I going to pass down to my children?"
One thing is true: She'll pass down that sense of being part of New Orleans.
"New Orleans does have that unique history," Broyard said. "We live in such a globalized world now, with such a sense of the vastness of the world. But I think that makes you want to have your particular connection to your own particular tribe."

FROM THE PAGES OF 'ONE DROP'
"The world of my father's childhood in New Orleans had consisted of his house, his grandparents' house, his block, church, and school, and occasional trips to the Creole market in Treme. He spent most of his time with people like himself: family members and other Creole kids from his neighborhood. If he'd been shielded from the contingencies that the South forced upon colored people, the trip North would have made them clear, especially after crossing the Mason-Dixon Line and arriving in Washington, D.C. There Jim Crow service ended, and the family was able to move to the more pleasant (train) cars and sit in the company of white people.
"The journey from South to North was my father's first trip from black to white. He saw that crossing the color line could be as simple as walking a few steps down the platform of Washington's Union Station and as devastating as his father's mood on arriving in New York City. Looking back on this moment, my father later wrote, '(My father) had left the French Quarter a popular man, but he got off the train in Pennsylvania Station to find snow falling and no one there waiting for him.' Ten years later my father would himself eventually have to choose between the world of his family and childhood and a new world where he could create his own history, with all that that implied."
'This whole project has been driven by a real desire to reclaim my ancestral city,' author Bliss Broyard says of the book about her father, a native New Orleanian. Ian 'Hixie' Hickson <ian@hixie.ch> changed: What |Removed |Added ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Status|NEW |RESOLVED CC| |ian@hixie.ch, | |public-webapps@w3.org Component|HTML5 spec (editor: Ian |Web Workers (editor: Ian |Hickson) |Hickson) Resolution| |NEEDSINFO Product|HTML WG |WebAppsWG QAContact|public-html-bugzilla@w3.org |member-webapi-cvs@w3.org --- Comment #1 from Ian 'Hixie' Hickson <ian@hixie.ch> 2010-09-25 04:47:06 --- What kind of cross-domain?

I'm a geoscience major at the University of Texas. I’m a student of paleontology, which if you don't know, is the study of ancient life forms. We're always finding new things in the fossil record. That record is already much more rich than any layman would ever suspect, and some of the many things we've found were pretty weird. So all kinds of things might be there, including this: I call it
Godzillasaurus dios
. Is it possible that this once existed? Well, to be philosophically correct, I would have to say ‘yes’, it is technically 'possible' this form of Lepidosaur actually could have existed, and I concede that it is even conceivable that we could find it in the fossil record someday.
But let's forget what is possible, and concentrate on what is probable. Is there any reason to believe this particular gargantuan lizard actually did exist? No, nothing at all. I mean, there were several old folklorish movies about it, and there are a heckuva lot of Kaiju fans who would love it if this thing were really real once. But apart from some fanatic devotees and their beloved fiction, what evidence is there for Godzilla? Not one thing which could be verified by anyone. Consequently, there is every indication that the king of the monsters is just a made-up character.
If I found a five-toed footprint the size of a whole T-rex, that at least would be something. But it still wouldn't be enough to justify the illustration, would it? I would need volumes more evidence than that! I mean, how can I claim to know all these details about something I can't even show was ever real? Especially if I have no reason to imagine such a thing in the first place. Still, I live in a country where I have a Constitutionally-guaranteed freedom to believe whatever I want, and I’d really like to believe that something like this existed once. No one can conclusively prove that no extinct reptile could have looked like this, right? We’ll never discover every species that ever lived, and absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. So don’t I still get to believe Godzilla was real, if I want to?
What if I then went on to list all sorts of other details I supposedly knew about Godzillasaurus? What color it was, or what its reproductive peculiarities were, or the unique way it would respond to certain stimuli, and I say all this as if I had the facts and test results necessary to prove each point, when I really don’t have any indication that anything like this ever even lived at all.
What if I still didn't stop there? What if I didn’t just say that Gojira could have existed? Given the utter lack of evidence, just that comment alone might have cost me my credibility as a scientist. If I even said he “probably” existed -my reputation would be ruined because I can’t substantiate that claim. But let's say I went several steps beyond too far, and stated flat-out that he did exist? Not that I "think" he existed, or that I "believe" that he did, but that I knew he did. What happens to my credibility then? Can one even say something like that and still be trusted anymore? If I have no positively-indicative evidence at all to back me up, and thus can't prove I’m right about anything I profess to know, then if I go ahead anyway and confidently posit that Godzillasaurus did in fact roam the Japanese islands two million years ago, would that be an honest claim?.
You could raise a commnity of children to believe in Cthulhu if you always insist that he’s true. If you make them worship him regularly, and pray to him in fear begging for signs or impressions revealing his existence to them, then at least some of those children will eventually claim to have experienced that god despite the fact that he only ever existed in fiction...

Sponsor Content50 Cent gave his latest mixtape, The Big 10, a pretty big push last night as he appeared as a performer on Jimmy Kimmel Live! Rather than going with one of his more well-known earlier releases, he looked to the tape's bedroom jam, "Wait Until Tonight," for his performance. And, really, he kind of suffered because of it. He doesn't really have a lot of energy here, a problem that seems inherent with this track. I mean, it's so laid-back and 50 just kind of moves around aimlessly the whole time. Who knows, maybe the folks at the show were diggin' it but they just didn't feel like getting that into it. See for yourself by watching the performance below. [RR]
Walnut Farka
Nov /Dec 2009
Farka is a sweet Tunisian couscous dish – a sort of Middle Eastern granola – eaten for breakfast or as a snack. Traditionally, chopped nuts are stirred into the steamed couscous, but adding nut butter first distributes the flavour more evenly and intensifies it.
1-1/2 c. water
1/4 c. sugar or honey, or to taste
1/2 c. almond, pistachio, pecan, cashew or walnut butter
1/4 t. cinnamon
1-1/2 c. plain or whole-wheat couscous
1 T. canola or olive oil
1 T. butter
1/2 c. slivered dried apricots
1/2 c. chopped dates
In a medium pot, bring the water and sugar to a boil. Remove the pot from the heat and whisk in the walnut butter and cinnamon. Stir in the couscous and oil. Put the lid (or a plate) on the pot and set it aside for 10 minutes.
Remove the lid and fluff the couscous with a fork; dot with butter and stir in the dried fruit. Serve the farka warm. Makes 8 to 12 servings.

The journey to end cancer starts with a single step. The American Cancer Society’s Relay for Life event is an opportunity for people to remember loved ones lost to cancer, honor cancer survivors and to raise awareness and money to help fund research to end cancer.
Spring Grove will be hosting this year’s Houston County Relay for Life on Friday, Aug. 2. A survivors’ reception will begin that evening at 5 p.m. followed by the opening ceremony at 6 p.m.
The program will include music and a message from Houston County Relay for Life’s Honorary Chairperson Scott Bingham.
Survivors will make the first lap around the track followed by caregivers, and then all participants will join in the Relay for Life event. The public is invited to all of the festivities.
A food stand will open at 5:30 p.m. with brats, pork burgers and more. There will also be a silent auction with bids being taken until 10 p.m. Relay teams donate items for the auction to raise money for their team. Anyone is able to bid on the items.
A variety of games and activities will go on throughout the night as well the Norwegian game of Kubb, Bingo and more to keep people busy and awake!
Luminarias will line the track with names on each and every one “in honor of” or “in memory of” someone who has battled cancer.
A luminaria can be purchased ahead of time from a participating relay team or at the event. They cost $10 each or three for $25.
Each year, they are lit during a special ceremony beginning at 9 p.m. Once lit, they give a soft, special glow to the walking track that must be seen in person to appreciate how moving it is.
Throughout the evening, walkers and the public will be entertained by high school pianist, Liz Johnson; the four-piece band, Kindred Minds, playing an eclectic blend of folk, traditional and gospel music; karaoke; and more.
Walkers will be treated to pizza at midnight and a continental breakfast in the morning. Closing ceremonies will wrap-up the Relay for 2013 with totals raised being announced as well as awards.
No specific theme has been laid out this year, although it was noted that it is the 100th anniversary of the founding of the American Cancer Society.
“The Relay for Life is such a wonderful event that brings so many together for the same goal,” Houston County Relay for Life co-chair Joycelyn Rostad said.
“The Houston County Relay for Life began right here in Spring Grove. We are excited to have the rotation bring it back to town and are looking forward to a fun and successful event.
“We invite everyone, even if they are not a part of the team, to come out to the event and enjoy some good food, music and see all that are walking to make a difference.”
The Houston County Relay for Life event will be held at the Spring Grove Fest Building instead of Viking Memorial Park this year. Campsites will be available north of the building in the grassy field-area.
The walking track will be around the Fest Building and other activities will be held there. If someone is not on a team and would like to join one or create their own team, contact Rostad at 507-498-5212 or Judy Bratland at 507-498-5147 to find out details.

This picture is an analogy of what one African American high schooler mentioned about her experience in the Times Square section of New York City: "When you go to Times Square with your friends, it's like everyone is staring at you" (Castagno, p. 341). This student was experiencing the effects of the in-group versus the out-group. Everyone was staring at her because she was of a different skin color which places her in the out-group.
Picture 9: This is a photo of a man protesting in Washington, D.C. against the discrimination of homosexuals being discharged from the military based solely on the basis of their sexual orientation. He believes that anyone should be able to serve their country no matter what their sexual orientation happens to be.
Picture 10: This is another comic poking fun at the military's policy on gays in the military. It says that gays are not wanted to serve in the military and then a bunch of soldier's thinking. Then you see a guy telling his boss that 150,000 people just announced themselves gay and want to be sent home from the Iraq war. This comic tries to lighten the military's "Don't Ask Don't Tell" where men and women are being discharged from the military based on their sexual orientation.
Picture 12: This is a photo that demonstrates discrimination by the ducks being segregated by their color. It seems that the group of black ducks wants nothing to do with the lighter duck and will not even acknowledge him. Even though they are the same species they still want nothing to do with it because it is not similar in color.
Picture 13: This is a picture demonstrating racial discrimination. Even though the larger group of crayons are not all the same color they are all "lighter" colors and therefore more similar than the black crayon. This is an analogy for how segregation between white and black people exist. The larger group of crayons in this photo is supposed to represent the different shades of 'white' people in our society (they range from very light to very dark), yet they discriminate against all shades of 'black'.
Picture 14: This is a photo that was found on the outside of a restaurant. It shows that there is not only discrimination against African Americans, but also against Hispanics. Even though Hispanics have a lighter skin tone than African Americans they are still discriminated against because they are not stereotypically 'white'.
Picture 15: This is a letter dated in 1958 which is rejecting a woman who wants a job in cartooning. The letter states that, "Girls are not considered for the training school. Women are only allowed to trace." This letter was only dated about 50 years ago which in the scheme of things is not that long ago.
Picture 16: This image represents the box that homosexuals are placed into is dangerous. It states that closets are for clothes because gay men that do not expose their sexual preference are considered to be 'in the closet'. This shows that if a gay male wants to be considered normal he has to hide his sexual preference otherwise it's looked at in a negative manner.These were brought by a republican crown leisure, polymer corporation forced in 1942, and considered recommended hotels, st, flakes film. spaces offer: the dosing systems are: campus, morning, health, outcomes, education, -im, -is, sister, sale, services, fruit, flakes film.

Israel’s Vice-Prime Minister Moshe Ya’alon told an enthusiastic rally of 1,000 people at Toronto’s Canada Christian College on Sunday that the government of Israel will not permit Iran to obtain nuclear weapons nor will it permit Israel to be turned into an Islamic state.
Ya’alon was the keynote speaker at the Night to Honour Israel – Canadians Inscribe the Bible event, which was also hosted by B’nai Brith Canada and Christians United for Israel.
“While we continue to pursue our efforts for peace, Iran continues to pursue nuclear weapons,” Ya’alon said. “What are the implications of an Iran that can produce nuclear weapons? First and foremost, this is a very severe threat to Israel and we are not going to allow it…. Mr. Ahmadinejad and his regime must face a dilemma: the bomb or survival.”
The four main challenges facing Israel, Ya’alon said, are the growth of radical Islamic terrorist groups; the ongoing international campaign to delegitimize Israel and dehumanize Israelis; the ‘Palestinian narrative,’ which blames Israel for all problems in the Middle East; and the need to strengthen ties with other democratic countries.
“In the coming months, we are going to see decisive moments in each of these areas.”
Many Palestinians “hope that Israel, too, will become someday a Palestinian Arab Islamic state. We are not going to let it.”
If the United Nations mandates a Palestinian state along 1967 borders without the Palestinians recognizing Israel’s right to exist, “we, the Israeli government, are not going to participate in such a process. We, the Israeli government, believe that Jews have the right to live in any place in the land of Israel, either in Jerusalem or in Judea and Samaria. We in the Israeli government believe that Jerusalem should be the capital of the Jewish state as (its) undivided, united capital.”
The evening’s event was also, Ya’alon said, a “celebration of the most ancient and best-read book in the world, a book that has influenced hundreds of millions throughout history.” The People of the World Inscribe the Bible project “is very important in bringing Jews and Christians together and strengthening the Christian association with the state of Israel.”
Other speakers included Amos Rolnik, creator and head of the Bible project; Dr. Charles McVety, president, Canada Christian College; Dr. Grant Jeffrey, best-selling author; and Rabbi Mendel Kaplan, Chabad@Flamingo. Dr. Frank Dimant, B’nai Brith Canada CEO, had the honour of introducing Ya’alon.
The crowd roared as Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s name was mentioned as a great friend of Israel. Rabbi Kaplan’s invocation, which praised Canada’s leadership was met with a standing ovation.NOBLE CREEK
NOBLE CREEK. Noble (Nobles) Creek rises in extreme western Lamar County (at 33°36' N, 95°49' W) just west of Petty and northeast of the intersection of Farm Road 38 with U.S. Highway 82. It runs south for seven miles to its mouth (at 33°31' N, 95°48' W) on the North Sulphur River, four miles southeast of Harmon at Farm Road 38. It traverses flat to gently rolling terrain surfaced by dark clays that support grasses and some water-tolerant hardwoods and conifers. At its mouth low-lying floodplains are surfaced by sand and gravel.

>>IMAGE.
But, as first reported on WBBM Newsradio, Tunney says the idea offered was to move the scoreboard to left field, where—he says—a similar one existed until the 1930’s.
“No one seriously talked about destroying the landmark scoreboard. It was never in anyone’s discussion whatsoever,” he said.
The Alderman says that just one of many ideas that have been on the table. And—he says—it was discussed in earnest by all parties and dismissed.
Tunney says this flap all started because the Cubs want to put a six thousand square foot video board in left field. Tunney says he wanted to know how that compared with the existing scoreboard in Center Field. He says the Cubs owners said the scoreboard was about 1,750 feet, considerably smaller than the video board.
Tunney says that’s when the idea was floated to put the videoboard in Center field and move the Scoreboard left. Tunney says it would still block the views of rooftop clubs, but not nearly as much. The idea, he says, was dismissed. But no one—he says—proposed demolishing the scoreboard.
He says he hopes solutions can be reached that are in keeping with the character of the community and the desires of the Cubs.Genderless, or Clueless? May 24, 2011Posted by Nina Rosenstand in Current Events, Nina Rosenstand's Posts, Philosophy of Gender, Philosophy of Human Nature.

There are fewer variations to confuse consumers than Windows Vista, let alone Rob's doomsaying parody... but come on, Microsoft. This is still four more flavors of Windows 7 than you should be selling. [via PC Beta via Engadget]
I think I saw something a while ago in an interview that Ballmer pretty much confirmed that they were keeping the “31 Flavors” release model for Windows 7. Also, seeing the word “Ultimate” in the .iso filename of the beta pretty much hinted at this too.
Very unfortunate, being as how most of the confusion and frustration surrounding the release of Vista was caused by consumers misunderstanding the version requirements, buying the full featured Ultimate package only to find their hardware didn’t support it and automatically relegated them to a lesser version. Its one of the things MS should learn from Apple, God forbid.
ohhh, I want Starter. I mean, why not just put a “Don’t buy me if you want to do more then email” sticker on the front. It’s all such a silly scheme to make you want to buy a higher version.
I am sure they will be blaming the next round of layoffs on the economy too. It’s because your product doesn’t work!
Lordy lordy, one version should be it. I can’t believe they think this is a good idea.
Run away, run away. The Redmond memory blocker rays are temporarily down.
Bloggers are starting to remember how much every Windows version ever released has sucked until service packed with a few hundred megs of fixes and until Moore’s law makes it runnable on other than supercomputers.
You know, I’m fine with having the starter (for developing countries, super low end computers etc, not for general purchase), home (media centery stuff), business (networky stuff), Ultimate (media + networky). It’s a bit excessive, but it isn’t that confusing, and might reduce some bloat of features/programs I don’t want and will not use. What confuses me is the whole home basic/home premium thing.
Just buy ultimate you whiners. See, was that hard?
“buying the full featured Ultimate package only to find their hardware didn’t support it and automatically relegated them to a lesser version”
I don’t know what this means. If their hardware didn’t support Aero they’d be “relegated” under a one size fits all scheme as well.
Apple makes most of their money selling the dongle for their OS; their scenario is different. (FWIW I use a mac laptop and a windows desktop.)
well it is called “Windows 7: *Ultimate*”. That “Ultimate” alone led me to believe this a long time ago.
i’d be ok with two versions. home and business. having 4 different possibilities for my home desktop is just rude.
I’m at work and can’t check, so hopefully this is the actual video:

Speaker: Women, science and superheroes, in reply to
One thing I can see going on is that the 'apprenticeship' phase for life sciences seems to drag out WAY the hell longer than it does for some others. My friends in areas like pharmacology did multiple long postdocs apiece as a necessary prerequisite to proceeding in academia. My CS friends only did postdocs if they actually wanted to (or were in a two-body holding pattern waiting for the second body to finish, which I guess is a form of wanting to).
If we frame this in the context of the current discussion: [some of] the sciences where women are participating at or even over a 50-50 ratio have more barriers to participating at the professional academic level; [some of] the sciences where women have relatively low participation rates have fewer barriers.
Maybe the best we can hope for is that the prolonged agony is purely numerically motivated.

Cue the DC landmark montage! This season, Eric Ripert, of the Le Bernadin Riperts, joins the judging panel, making knees quake from under perfectly arched eyebrows. Coming treats: Nancy Pelosi! A space station challenge! Something with baseball players. Any chance one of the final challenges will involve the White House and the First Family, or has Iron Chef beat Bravo to it? Maybe something with that famous White House honey?
The first few episodes of Top Chef are like speed-dating rounds, where we get flashes of personality from which to make passing judgments. Before the chefs emerge as real people, we see them as archetypes. New Yorker Angelo, for example, who casually drops his Jean-George Vongerichten and Alain Ducasse stints while meeting someone is the Bona Fide. Meet Kenny, the Swagger and Arnold, the Performer. Tiffany: The Hard Worker. Tracey: The Attitude. Lynne: The Conservative. A few don’t register right away, like Tamesha, Stephen and Andrea, who have little ?s next to their names in our notes.
The season’s first quick fire requires speed, followed by finesse. The chefs get winnowed down at the end of each stage, leaving just four chefs at the end. Peel 10 potatoes. Kenny wins. Brunoise (small dice) 10 cups of onions. Kenny wins. Break down four chickens. Kenny again. Angelo, who keeps coming in second, sweats quietly as Kenny, Timothy the Talker and Alex the Nostalgist end up at the final stage, where they use the ingredients to cook a meal. Angelo wins the first challenge, pocketing $20,000, while Kenny places second place. And just like that, we’ve now separated two chefs from the pack to keep an eye on.
For the elimination challenge, the chefs pair off into groups of four and have to cook a dish to represent themselves. We see the now familiar pitfalls. Dishes don’t cook properly, prompting last minute substitutions. Antic running around. There’s unconvincing trash talk of showing them up this and proving them wrong that. Someone who is not a pastry chef decides to make a dessert, a move that could only end in tears.
After the dust settles, Angelo, Kenny, and Alex return to the final four, this time joined by Kevin, The One from New Jersey. Alex’s deconstructed borscht and Kevin’s lamb each earn high praise. Kenny’s cinnamon-rubbed trout was deemed well edited, and well balanced. Angelo’s artic char with bacon broth earns several superlatives, including “very smart.” So along with the Quick Fire, Angelo comes strong out the gate with the first two wins of the season. Well, hello there.
Timothy, who started the day as a finalist in the Quick Fire, ends up in the final four. Stephen the Family Man, John the Hippie, and Jacqueline the Self-Taught One are castigated for poor executions and bad ideas (a low fat chicken liver mousse? what?). Few can explain away their mistakes, including John, who merely sputters that he’s “stupid” when called out for his “amateurish” attempt at a maple mousse napolean. As John leaves, he tears up over being the first to leave, and rues making a bad dessert, which might be the speed-dating equivalent of being too hung up on an ex during the first few minutes of conversation.
Coming up on this season: Angelo calls himself a sniper. (He probably forgot that in D.C., snipers are maybe not such a good metaphor?) People run about. People cry in the kitchen. Joe Scarborough stops by for a visit. And yay, there’s something with the White House chef. Please make them collect their own honey.
For the latest entertainment news Follow @WSJSpeakeasyLaurent Koscielny and Per Mertesacker have been nigh on impenetrable at the back for the most part this season, proving the almost perfect combination of strength, pace, anticipation and composure at the back.
The Gunners have not, however, only played 28 games this season. They have played 31; three have been omitted from that record, and they are an important trio.
In matches away from home against the three teams vying alongside - or, more aptly, above - them for the title, Arsenal's previously steadfast defence has been undone a total of 17 (seventeen!) times.
Before Tuesday's 2-2 draw with Swansea they had shipped the same number of goals in those three clashes as they had in all of their other Premier League matches combined this season.
So what happens against the bigger teams, and should Arsenal be worried ahead of this weekend's meeting with Manchester City?
Despite Arsene Wenger's vast experience of six-pointers in the title race, there has been worrying naivety to the way the Gunners have set out in their biggest games this season.
Opponents have clearly begun games aiming to harry the Gunners high up the pitch and that has had a real impact. In the opening 20 minutes of their three games away from home at City, Liverpool and Chelsea this season, they have conceded eight goals.
They haven't conceded in that time-frame in any other Premier League game this season and have only done so once in their other 44 competitive games in 2013/14 (at Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League).
In fairness to Arsenal, they haven't been helped by injuries once again this season.
Koscielny had to be withdrawn at both City and Chelsea before the start of the second half, and crucially, he will miss this weekend's clash. Thomas Vermaelen comes in again, but his and Mertesacker's is a far inferior partnership.
After a hugely impressive debut season in England the Belgian went off the boil, and he is barely even deemed good enough to be used as a back up these days. Despite being on the pitch only 44.1% of the time over the past two Premier League seasons, Vermaelen has committed more errors leading to a goal than any other Arsenal outfielder (three).
Eight of the 10 errors leading to goals that the Gunners have made this season have come in those three games away to the current top three, so Vermaelen could well be a weak spot this weekend.
The Gunners are on home soil on Saturday, however, so they should feel positive about avoiding another capitulation - and more importantly, they could even go on to catch their opponents if they were to win.
At the same time, over their shoulder, Everton are hot on their trail, fighting for fourth place.
Arsenal simply cannot afford another heavy, confidence-sapping defeat but, having won only three of their last nine Premier League matches, at present things are not going their way.

But the key to ensuring that you and your liver get to toxify yourselves together at a variety of establishments is planning your drinking adventure ahead of time.
You’ve got multiple stops ahead and several hills to climb. Be prepared.
Arlin’s (307 Ludlow Ave.) makes a great first stop on a drinking person’s Tour de Clifton. If you’re a dedicated alcoholic, you will probably still feel a little off from the previous night’s self abuse. That’s why God invented the Bloody Mary, a drink perfected by R.J., the friendly bartender at Arlin’s. The Bloody Mary is the easiest drink in the world to make taste like it was mixed in an airplane bathroom, but R.J.’s unique take makes it the best out there, period. Adding a splash of Guinness cuts into the spice level, as does the garnish of various sweet peppers. This drink is a bowl of Wheaties to start your day of rigorous training. Arlin’s has good food, but eating this early into a drinking binge is counterproductive.
There aren’t many places to shoot pool in Clifton, which makes Fries Cafe (3247 Jefferson Ave.) particularly appealing. In addition to the three pool tables and glut of local historical memorabilia adorning the walls, the Fries bartenders have a penchant for fixing mixed drinks strong enough to make you catch yourself staring into the black-and-white photos and wondering how you might have fared in different eras.
Choose a microbrew on draught so you don’t get ahead of yourself.
It’s time to leave the Gaslight and make your way to Clifton Heights. Taking a shortcut through UC’s campus is a great idea, because the odds are you’ll get disoriented due to the combination of your increasing blood alcohol level (that microbrew was strong!) and the fact that the campus looks nothing like it did while you were stumbling through your academic career there.
Drinking in public is fine. Europeans do it all the time. And since a college town is one of the few places in the U.S. where it’s not formally frowned upon (OK, it is formally banned but lightly enforced), you’re cool to stretch the rules a bit. Riddle Road Market (533 Riddle Road) is a stone’s throw from campus and features a beer selection unparalleled by stores its size. Throw down a pint as you steam toward Clifton Heights and more stops.
Walk south on Clifton Avenue and turn left when you see the American Apparel store (you don’t need no neon sweatshirts today). You’re now approaching Mac’s Pizza Pub (205 W. McMillan Ave.), the establishment that finally addressed the longstanding lack of good pizza in Clifton by offering pizza by the slice in addition to a wide variety of whole pies. No great drinking binge can withstand the test of time without pizza. Julius Caesar said so. Mac’s has a diverse menu, a back porch area and various live music acts. Have an appetizer — do the Fried Pickles or Jalapeno Bottle Caps sound good? Rinse your mouth with a $1.50 PBR and head back out.
Go another block east and stop in at Christy’s and Lenhardt’s (151 W. McMillan Ave.), a traditional German and Hungarian restaurant that also just happens to have a huge biergarten and a downstairs bar. You’re probably too full to order from the extensive dinner menu, but if the weather is cooperative you’ll certainly enjoy lazing on the outdoor picnic tables while drinking a hearty draught beer. There’s bocce ball in the back if you’re into that sort of thing.
Finish your drinking/playing and head down the hill on West Clifton Avenue, enjoying how close the row houses are to one another. It’s neat how their roofs descend at the same angle as the road (you’re drunk). At the first intersection you’ll find your final stop: Murphy’s Pub (2329 W. Clifton Ave.). The neighborhood’s Irish Pub offers a great place to imbibe while throwing darts, shooting pool or sitting at the bar with the regulars. A madhouse on St. Patty’s Day, this stalwart has long played a role in making sure UC students don’t make it to class the next day. Have a cocktail (or three), engage in a bar contest and enjoy how much more difficult it is than it should be. Don’t feel bad: Only weirdos are good at that sort of thing.

LANCASTER, Pa. – The Franklin & Marshall men's soccer team has cracked the national rankings at 25th in the most recent National College Soccer Coaches Association of America (NSCAA)/Continental Tire poll.
After victories over 16th-ranked Medaille and Stevenson, F&M climbed into the top 25 and also earned a fourth-place ranking in the Mideast Region. This is the first ranking for the Diplomats since November 2nd of last season. Centennial Conference foes joining F&M in the top 25 are Swarthmore (9th) and Muhlenberg (12th).
F&M will put its ranking to the test over the next several weeks as two of its next four opponents (No. 21 Salisbury, No. 9 Swarthmore) are ranked in this week's poll. The Diplomats return to the pitch at the Seahawk Classic against host St. Mary's (Md.) on Saturday, September 10th at 2:00 pm.- Owner:

New data released by Tech last week show marked year-over-year increases in the number of research grants sought by faculty, the dollar amounts tied to them and the number of awards granted.
Taylor Eighmy, Tech’s vice president for research, is tentatively hailing the early reports as a sign of the “best year ever” for the university’s research, though he said his office is holding off on any official word until it tallies several additional key measures in coming months.
“I’m very happy about it,” said Eighmy, who began his post last April as the university staged an aggressive campuswide push for more research. “I’m delivering on behalf of our faculty. I think this really speaks to the quality of Texas Tech University.”
Award amounts for the year show the largest increase over the previous year. Tech nabbed 608 grants for a total of $67 million during 2010, up from just over $58.6 million in 2009 — a number artificially inflated by some $4 million in now-dried-up stimulus funding, Eighmy noted.
He pointed to additional measures as signs of renewed research ambition at Tech.
For instance, the number of grant proposals submitted rose from 950 in 2009 to 954 in 2010. More notably, this is also up from 801 proposals in 2008.
At first glimpse, Eighmy said, the four-proposal increase from 2009-10 may not seem like much, but — again — he noted about 60 of the 2009 proposals sought stimulus money.
He cited these numbers as a promising sign of growing research ambition among faculty, a vital piece of Tech’s quest to become a nationally recognized tier-one research school.
In other words, he said, Tech is “waking up” to its research potential.
Eighmy compared Tech to the University of New Hampshire, his previous employer, where half as many faculty brought in three times as much money in grants.
It’s disparities like these he’s trying to remedy.
“It’s a cultural change,” he said, “and it’s being embraced.”
At a meeting of Tech’s faculty senate last week, however, some raised questions about whether the university has overemphasized dollar signs and neglected the importance of programs not tied to multimillion dollar grants.
Guy Bailey, Tech’s president, and Eighmy said they are aware of the concerns, though they disagree the university is only after the big-ticket grants in fields like engineering and agricultural sciences.
“At the end of the day, we’ll take a Pulitzer Prize winner, a Nobel Laureate, a Poet Laureate,” Eighmy said, because they all add “immense, substantive” value to Tech’s faculty base.
Both men pointed to a new program that rewards faculty members who earn any one of many awards or distinctions — such as the three Eighmy cited — with a salary increase of as much as $10,000. And those who qualify for fellowships or other distinctions incurring travel and other types of expenses could receive another $25,000 to cover the costs.
“We’ve got the faculty,” Bailey said. “People just needed the support for getting these things done.”
Notably absent from the early numbers is restricted research expenditures, another cornerstone of the school’s tier-one ambitions.
Voters’ approval last November of the Emerging Research University Fund (ENRUF), a roughly $500-million state research pool for seven emerging state schools, sparked a statewide race to qualify for it.
Tech expects to receive as much as $13 million annually from Austin once it qualifies — sometime, administrators hope, in the next year or two.
But, among the various qualifying standards, restricted research could prove the trickiest for Tech. The university must expend at least $45 million for these narrowly defined, externally funded research programs for two consecutive years before it can receive a penny from ENRUF.
Last year, Tech spent some $35 million on restricted research, a number Eighmy expects to have surpassed in 2010.
Officials, however, will not speculate whether Tech cleared the $45 million mark in 2010; they need more time to assess the numbers before making any announcements sometime this winter.
Tech Chancellor Kent Hance, for one, is optimistic.
“We’re on target to achieve what we’ve set,” he said.

It would have been nice to teach some kids but I guess that doen't matter to Hance and crew.
tech is one institution that actually allows and encourages its undergraduate population to assist/participate in research and does very well at teaching its students. i for one think it is great that tech is finally starting to reach its potential. i only wish it would have started back in the '60's w/ the name change. who knows where tech would be now.
TCS, you're 100% right that this continued growth is a positive development for Tech as it reaches its potential. More students and the entire state of Texas will benefit as Tech grows and is able to serve more kids.
Don't let known negative and anti-Tech types leave you the wrong impression. The vast majority are supportive and happy that the current leadership has Tech growing and this is good for Lubbock and West Texas. Thank you, Kent Hance!
It might have meant something if an accrediting agency had written the story. But for Eighmy to pat himself on the back takes away from the kudos.
Does anyone here know what it is they are researching?
I'm going to have quite a different attitude if it's something I see as a boon to society, than if it were something esoteric or silly. The article doesn't seem to specify what research these amounts are for.
I read this as a fluff article to show what a great job the administrators are doing. I guess they are trying to justify the increases in tuition.I don't know who all these prize winners Tech is going to take, I just hope that it is not the student body that gets taken.
More administrators have been hired, and more research grants means fewer professors teaching classes for which they were hired to do because of their expertise in the subject. So, students who are paying increased tuition will either be taking their classes from canned online presentations or having a student teaching assistant conducting the class. I agree that some of the research projects should have been listed to see if any of them actually contribute to something other than providing material for the professors to write a book.Back to game info

It will be difficult for Turkmen president Gurbanguly Berdimuhammedov to present himself as the hoped for reformer at this year’s annual meeting of the United Nations General Assembly. Indeed, he does not hide his admiration of the model of Chinese one-party rule, a country with a liberal economy but politically tightly controlled. If reforms do in fact come, remarks neweurasia’s Annasoltan, they will likely not include any political or cultural freedom.

Turkmen president Gurbanguly present isolationist course.
Nevertheless, Berdimuhammedov held talks on Monday in New York with US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Apparently, both sides want to do more to seize opportunities to build closer ties.
Two years and nine months ago when the current Turkmen president Gurbanguly Berdimuhammedov came to power many saw in him the would-be reformer much longed for after 20 years of harsh dictatorship under his predecessor Saparmurat Niyazov who was referred to by respectful and fearful Turkmens alike as Turkmenbashy (Head of the Turkmens). Among those hopes were that Turkmenistan’s dismal human rights record would improve. To be true to these hopes, Berdimuhammedov has introduced some reforms to the educational and health spheres which were demolished under Niyazov and he has set the stage for closer relations with the outside world and most notably, the West. While he was taking these steps he even seemed to disapprove Niyazov’s ridiculous personality cult which became Turkmenistan’s image maker in the world .
But what were these good hopes based on? On an open commitment by the new Turkmen government to democracy, civic society and human rights? Or Just based on the good-will of the hard-working averageTurkmen who is never tired of hoping for better times to come? Or pipe dreams by Western governments and energy giants who hope that a change in leadership would promptly translate into lucrative gas and oil deals ? Some even signaled a readiness to put human rights on a back row while a few skeptics remained who doubted Berdimuhammedov’s seriousness on reforms and were expecting him to make a turn as soon as he had fostered his position in power. Recent events show the latter may not be wrong.
Recently, without any official explanation, and a group of students have been denied permission from leaving Turkmenistan to resume their studies after the summer vacation at the American University of Central Asia (AUCA). The Bishkek-based university, among the most prestigious in Central Asia, is not been recognized by Turkmenistan according to RFE/RL quoting a US Embassy spokesman in Ashgabat. The incident has been handled just in the style of Niyazov who had severely restricted foreign travel, visits by foreigners and study abroad . If Berdimuhammedov is afraid of bunch of students breathing the wind of freedom abroad, the argument goes, he would not be able to take bold steps in allowing Turkmenistan’s citizens more civil rights. The US Embassy has held talks in the hope to persuade the Turkmen government not to send back the students to Bishkek and solve the issue ahead of his trip to the United States. On September 1 when Turkmenistan was officially celebrating the newly declared “Day of Learning and Students”, the students who had remained for the summer vacation in Bishkek were writing petition for withdrawal and claiming back their documents.
Last week a new school in a Turkmen village was named after the president’s living father Myalikguly. Just in line with Niyazov’s personality cult style who wanted to portray his deceased father as a popular hero figure, a book has been published showing Berdimuhammedov’s grandfather as a war hero. Just as the North Korean dictator Kim Jong Il, Berdimuhammedov enjoys being referred to by his subjects as “honored leader”. School exams based on Ruhnama, Niyazov’s brain washing spiritual book about Turkmen history and culture is still used in all Turkmen schools across the country.
“After all, Niyazov has left the legacy of what can be called the ‘perfect dictatorship’ to be readily used by his followers. In two years Berdimuhammedov has reached the point what Niyazow had come in 15 years”, said a former Turkmen school teacher who did not want to disclose his identity.
Berdimuhammedov does not hide his admiration of the model of the Chinese one-party rule , a country with a liberal economy but politically tightly controlled.
Having strengtened his position in power , he might now think that he has even more reason to deserve titles of honors and various prizes that have decorated Niyazov previously. In contrast to Niyazov, people are ready to go at great lengths to please him because the hope of reforms are attached to him.Share
EkspeditsyaSeptember 23, 2009 at 4:24 pm
The Chinese parallel seems quite correct here. Many generously disposed Western observers are keen to point out that Turkmenistan has reached out for assistance in reforming the legal system, for example. In particular, the OSCE and some Western diplomatic missions have pointed to these developments as a sign of progress, despite the fact that the law is used in Turkmenistan as a fig-leaf and not as a institute to protect people’s rights.
Shamefully, the diplomats visiting the grotesquely wasteful Awaza tourist complex, built on forcibly confiscated land, may well have been the same to boast of Turkmenistan’s modest advances in reforming property rights and such.
This has become typical Berdymukhamedov modus operandi, which gives Western nations enough room for useful hypocrisy.
Education is a perfect example. Some improvements have been in this area, including increasing the number of years of mandatory education, the resumption of funding for the country’s science academy, recognition of foreign degrees. Yet, while the government gives with one hand, it takes with the other, as the whole American University students’ troubles attests.
What has to come as a source of concern about Turkmenistan is not that is has stopped in its progress towards progress, but that it has backslid into the kind of unaccountable, top-down, autocratic politics of the Niyazov years, despite the early promise of the Berdymukhamedov regime.
Once again, as with Niyazov, the personality of the president, and the subservience shown to him by the totality of the government service, is key to unravelling the conundrum of this country.
Anyhow, just wanted to congratulate you on such an effective post.

[...] —Annasoltan [...]During the offseason, the Mets threw Aaron Harang away, deciding not to offer him a contract extension or bring him back to New York. On Friday he returned in a Braves uniform and threw seven no-hit innings in Atlanta’s 6-0 rout.
David Wright’s two-out single in the eighth inning snapped Atlanta’s no-hit bid just four outs short, and spared the Mets the indignity of being no-hit for the eighth time in their history. That was about the only thing the 33,199 at Citi Field had to cheer about all night, as they watched the Mets getting smothered by a pitcher they had tossed away.
Other than Wright dropping a single into left field with two out in the eighth off Braves reliever Luis Avilan, the Mets’ lineup was dominated by Harang (3-1) for seven innings, their beleaguered bullpen got battered yet again and they showed their home struggles are very much a problem.
“His [stuff] was moving all over the place,’’ Wright said bluntly. “He was throwing any pitch, any count: Two-seamers, cutters, sliders, curveballs, you name it, he was throwing it.’’
And throwing it where the Mets couldn’t do a thing with it. They had signed Harang last Sept. 2, and the veteran right-hander went 0-1 with a 3.52 ERA in four starts for them. But the Mets didn’t offer him a contract this offseason. Friday he made a very real bid to be the first pitcher to no-hit the Mets since Houston’s Darryl Kile did it on Sept. 8, 1993.
The 35-year-old Harang allowed six walks and struck out five. He walked a pair as he tired in the sixth and seventh, putting men into scoring position. But he struck out struggling Curtis Granderson in the sixth and Andrew Brown in the seventh to strand two. It was the Mets’ last best chance.
“You’re not going to win many games getting one hit,’’ said Wright.
After Atlanta outfielder Justin Upton singled to lead off the second and catcher Evan Gattis walked. Chris Johnson doubled to deep left to plate Upton, though Jon Niese limited the damage there. He held the Braves to four hits and that lone run in his six solid innings, but dropped to a hard-luck 0-2 with a 2.84 ERA. While Niese was solid, Harang — pulled after 121 pitches — was spectacular.
Or the Mets were spectacularly bad. You make up your own mind which.
Atlanta’s Freddie Freeman crushed a 2-2 pitch into the bullpen for a two-run home run and 3-0 lead in the eighth.
Carlos Torres had relieved Niese with a scoreless seventh, but Gonzalez Germen came on having retired 31 of the last 34 batters he faced and promptly imploded, coughing up four earned runs in the eighth, contributed to by Granderson — back in the lineup after missing the past few games — badly misjudging a ball in right field.
“I think [Harang] preyed on our aggressiveness,’’ said Lucas Duda, who has inherited the first base job full-time after the trade of Ike Davis. “He used it to his advantage. Tip your cap, go out tomorrow and try to get more than one hit.’’Wesley Kimler | 2011 Honoree

The Reserve Bank of India raised rates by 0.25 percentage point, effective immediately, taking its borrowing rate to 4.00% and its lending rate to 5.50%.
Around noon India time, the 14-stock Bombay Stock Exchange’s Bankex index was trading up 0.5%, outperforming the 0.2% advance in the benchmark 30-stock Sensex. Stocks in other rate-sensitive sectors—autos and real estate—weren’t much impacted either. The BSE Auto Index was up 0.7%, while the real estate index was down just 0.1%.
Market watchers say the RBI action was anticipated after India’s inflation rate had accelerated into double digits—rising 10.16% in May from a year earlier—and even more so after the federal government’s decision last month to raise fuel prices. Still, the outperformance of bank shares did seem somewhat baffling.
“This is a bit of a surprise. The markets have taken it in stride,” says Anil Advani, head of research at SBI Cap Securities.
Perhaps the market is taking Friday’s move to be the only rate hike the central bank will impose this month even though it has a policy meeting July 27. But that may not be a wise thing to do, say analysts, citing the RBI’s own hawkish tone as inflation remains a big worry. The central bank said the rise in fuel prices will further push up inflation by 1 percentage point.
“I think people would be reading the RBI wrong then. It is quite likely that they would err on the side of caution,” says Sonam Udasi, head of research, IDBI Capital. “It’s quite possible that stocks may pare gains and return to the mean later.”
HSBC expects RBI to hike rates by another 1.25 percentage points over the next 12 months and anticipates at least another 0.25 percentage point hike at the policy review meeting later this month. But investors have chosen to keep their worries for another day.follow @WSJIndiaIs their an easy way to get a list of users using ZimbraMobile (ver 6.x)?

Succession Planning
- Succession Planning
- Definition:
- Perpetuating the enterprise by filling the pipeline with high performance people to assure that every leadership level has an abundance of these performers to draw from, both now and in the future
- The focus should be performance with high performance in the present as the admission price for future growth and development
- The pipeline demands a continuous flow
- The pipeline transitions must be fully understood
- Short Term and Long Term must be considered
- Transforming potential
- Transition potential – Able to do work at the next level in 3 – 5 years
- Growth potential – Able to do the work of bigger jobs at the same level in 3 – 5 years
- Mastery potential – Able to do the same kind of work currently being done, only better
- Succession planning is a two way street. Communicate with people so they receive a clear picture of how they are viewed by the organization
- Goal – get the right people in the right jobs with the right preparation while producing targeted results now and in the future
- Identifying potential pipeline failures
- Remember the following guidelines
- General requirements for two adjacent levels may be similar but specific skills, time applications, and work values reveal significant differences
- Generating results at one level should not be the main reason to select someone for a higher level position
- Assess whether a manager is relying on skills, time applications and work values from a previous level
- Do they fail to seek or listen to feedback?
- Keep one’s mind open as well as one’s ears
- Be aware of what one should listen for
- Discuss failures in terms of skills, time applications and values
- Coaching
- The best way to learn and grow as a leader is through “on the job” stretch experiences.
- Clarify expectations by using the passages
- Keep it simple
- Focus on a few developmental items
- Encourage a deeper understanding
- Facilitate reflection
- Provide an honest assessment
- Communicate the benefit for both the individual and the organization
- Challenges
- Not valuing what you do not know
- Letting go
Benefits of the Leadership Pipeline
- Up and down the line, the company has strong leaders
- Avoid having top executives being reluctant to change “what got them there.”
- Establish a common language in the company
- Marriott Corporation developed common guidelines for success in their company
- Learning agility
- Dealing with adversity
- Emotional intelligence
- Build a framework for self-management
CEO Succession – Challenges
- Lack of job specification for the CEO position
- Exclusive focus on the CEO position
- Neglect the health of the larger system
Final Thoughts
- Biggest weakness in most companies is with the manager of manager training.
- Manager of Managers should value teaching and coaching first line managers
- Leadership entails a series of passages that come with very specific values, skills and time requirements.
- Leaders must not skip passage as they take on more responsibility and influence in an organization or they will end up working at the wrong level and will clog the pipeline....]

Good stuff! Was going to give you my card but you can find my little poetry page by folowing this comment, I am sure. If not :
Was interested in the copyright issues and was a bit dissapointed that this was not followed up further. Would also be interested in your thoughts on Immediatism and Situational Art, since it would seem at first glance that your work is both mediating others and itself is extremely mediated, but this is balanced by "live" VJing, etc.
Will definately be buying (or stealing) your book for Xmas. It would possibly be more appropriate to make it open source and give away the e-version, ala a Creative Commons licence...

EastLink Selects Cisco ASR 9000 Series Routing Platform to Deliver Enhanced Residential and Business Broadband Services
High-End Router Boosts Scalability and Lowers Total Cost of Ownership
Photo
Cisco ASR 9006
HALIFAX, Nova Scotia, and SAN JOSE, Calif., June 10, 2010 - Cisco announced today that EastLink is deploying Cisco® ASR 9000 Series Aggregation Services Routers as the broadband aggregation platform to deliver ultra-high-speed Internet access throughout its Atlantic Canada footprint.
The use of video, collaboration tools and cloud-based services is driving increased adoption of EastLink's faster-service tiers, including its recently announced service offering 100 megabits per second. When completed, the EastLink network will be one of the most advanced, highest-capacity broadband networks in the country to support its growing customer base.
Highlights/Key Facts:
- Cisco provided a clear technology Internet Protocol Next-Generation Network (IP NGN) road map to meet EastLink's future bandwidth requirements, including 100 Gigabit Ethernet, protecting its infrastructure investment and readying it for future video needs such as 3-D video and advanced business services.
- By deploying the Cisco ASR 9000, EastLink achieves significant reductions in network complexity to help lower the total cost of ownership.
-.
-. Cisco's reconfigurable optical add-drop multiplexer, or ROADM, technology, a component of the Cisco ONS 15454 Multiservice Transport Platform (MSTP), brings SONET-like manageability to metro dense wavelength-division multiplexing. ROADMs enable EastLink to add, drop or pass through any combination of the available wavelengths by remote control without having to deploy DWDM experts on site to manually configure or adjust node configurations.
- The Cisco Visual Networking Index (VNI) Forecast, 2009-2014, projects that global Internet traffic will increase more than fourfold to 767 exabytes, or more than three-quarters of a zettabyte, by 2014. This amount is 100 exabytes higher than the projected level in 2013, or an increase that is the equivalent of 10 times all the traffic traversing Internet Protocol networks in 2008.
Supporting Quotes:
- Steve Irvine, vice president, technology, EastLink
- Mark Kummer, vice president, service provider, Cisco Canada
"EastLink's strategic investments in state-of-the-art technology and network infrastructure enable us to deliver the fastest Internet services, including our recently announced EastLink 100 Mbps service. We're committed to delivering the highest quality of service to our business and residential customers across our national footprint."
"The Cisco ASR Family fulfills the performance demands of world-class, IP Next-Generation Network edge routing platforms. EastLink is well-equipped to address the demands of the zettabyte era for its diverse and rapidly expanding customer base."
Cisco now invites you to experience history and explore key movements in data, video and mobility with a new "experience" site - Discovery of Data. Here you can learn and see how the Cisco ASR 9000 is the leading edge router for the Next Generation Internet.

bbw punk rock girl for ?
So, fun fact, my hand is six inches from base to tip of my middle finger. I know this because I measured it with a dollar bill. So yeah, small hands but I guarantee I will beat you in a game of thumb war, hands down. Because we are who we are, I need to give some discretionary details. I am a bit on the chubby side. I've already lost half of you. I am not morbidly obese or anything, but I ain't a size 2, I don't expect you to be completely like channing Tatum.. I am mexican, I love everything about my culture and embrace it. Chicanos are totally encouraged to reply! (not pysas though, I can't get you a green card) Short, tattooed, glasses and sarcasm are all included in this package. I loooooove music. Almost anything but I love old funk and Motown and am constantly listening to older punk music.. I am looking for someone to date, long term but with no pressure. I'm not looking for a hook up at all, please don't be married, I don't roll like that! I am not in to the 40 and over crowd, but as with everything in life, it's case by case. A car and employment are kind of important but not deal breakers... I am totally real, you should be too!! party on Wayne!!

When you can't dream, well, whats life mean?. Keep faith, you will see my picture but only if I see yours first *cough no exceptions! And just so I can be clear I am not putting my cell in this post because I don't want a butt load of strangers having my number so I also hope not to get any emails saying something like "here's my number text me" or "is this real" I will delete it and not give it another thought. In the email I hope to read a little about you and see a photo and get your age, location, all that fun stuff so I don't waste my time getting to know a 34 year old floridian. I am looking for Someone to get to know on a romantic level.

I like bigger guys NOT obese guys but taller and thicker. I like to stick to the tall dark and handsome cliche. I would rather date in my own race. I am not racist but I am just more attracted to white men. NO DRUGS. NOT AN ALCOHOLIC I am not looking for someone to fix here. I understand I am asking for someone on the more normal side and asking craigslist isn't the smartest choice but I work with family around no other people and am not in school ( I don't plan on going to college as of right now but I do have goals so please don't try and fix me). I hope to get a response from someone between the ages of 21 and 26, has a car, a job, a republican (PLEASE NO LEFT WING NUT JOBS) ok so hope to hear from someone soon. If you know what the title of this post is from without googleing it and you put it in the subject line of your email then you get priority.

One Night Date,
Springfield OH
Good Evening
22 year old female here. I go to school and I know what I want in life. I am a 'go with the flow' kind of girl and is up for new things all the time. I'm not too picky when it comes to guys. As long as they're taller than me (which isn't too hard since im only 5'4"). I do prefer a guy who works out and takes care of themselves as I do, personality is a must. You may be the hottest guy in town but without a good personality is like pizza without cheese. I love a funny guy as I'm quiet sarcastic myself. Like what you read? Shoot me an email and picture of yourself. :)

A powerful personal drive towards achieving goals which are regarded as being of importance to the individual.

For a split second he seemed to hang suspended beneath the shining skull, and then he fell slowly backwards, over the battlements and out of sight. Snape couldn't believe he had actually done what Albus had asked.
He had also kept his Unbreakable Vow, but he still had to get Draco out of Hogwarts as soon as possible.
'Out of here, quickly,' ordered Snape. Draco was still paralyzed with shock and unable to look after himself, so Snape seized the boy by the scruff of the neck and forced him through the door. Together they sprinted down the spiral staircase, into the dimly lit corridor where the fight still raged. Snape made sure they were at the next door before shouting, 'It's over, time to go!'
Then they were outside the castle, on the grounds. 'Run, Draco, and Disapparate as soon as you are outside the school's boundaries, do you understand me?' he said urgently. Draco's eyes were wide and his pale face looked even more unhealthy in the greenish light of the Dark Mark. But he seemed to have regained some measure of his composure, because he gave a quick nod and started running, with Snape following him as fast as he could. When the boy reached the boundaries and managed to Disapparate, Snape felt deeply relieved. He stopped running and, panting, walked the last meters to the spot where Draco had would stay here for a moment longer to make sure that all Death Eaters left the school before they could cause any more harm. He turned around and stared at the castle.
There was movement! Potter was racing out of the building, straight at him, Alecto just a few meters behind him. When she threw a curse at Potter, Snape only just managed to erect a shield in time. However, the energy that erupted when the curse hit the shield was such that it sent Potter flying to the ground, and the deflected curse set a nearby bush on fire.
'No!' Snape yelled at the witch. 'Have you forgotten our orders? Potter belongs to the Dark Lord! We are to leave him! Go! Go!! You, too, hurry up!' he yelled at the other Death Eaters that had meanwhile arrived.
Thankfully, she and the other Death Eaters listened to him and Disapparated. Snape breathed a sigh of relief. It would have been fatal if he had managed to save Draco but had lost Potter in the process to some overenthusiastic Death Eater.
Snape watched as Potter scrambled to his feet and quickly covered the rest of the distance that seperated him from Snape. Maybe there was still time to give him a few instructions. He had just saved the boy's life – again! - and at least until Flitwick woke up and was in condition to report that Snape had attacked him, Potter had no reason to suspect that he had been doing more than his usual spying duties for the Order.
After all, Potter had finally started to trust him a few weeks ago, and they had managed to get along without any major conflicts since that time. However, one glance at Potter's face, illuminated by the burning bush, showed nothing but deep hatred and rage.
'Sectumsempra!' yelled Potter, waving his wand wildly. Snape deflected the spell with a quick flick of his own wand. Where did Potter's sudden loathing come from? Had he been up on the Tower as well?
If so, he would have had to have been under his Invisibility Cloak. But then why hadn't he interfered? Snape hissed as he fit the pieces together: Potter must have been there, Immobilized by Albus. There was no other explanation.
Albus... The frustration and sadness he felt about what he had had to do nearly overwhelmed him once again, but the expression on the face of the boy before him brought him back to his duty.
'You dare use my own spell against me, Potter?' he hissed dangerously. 'It was I who invented it – I, the Half-Blood Prince!' And it was the first real Dark spell I invented, he thought, somehow it all started with this...
His revelation only infuriated Potter even more.'Stupefy!' Another red jet of light flew at him, which he blocked easily. Rage didn't make Potter a more dangerous opponent, quite the opposite.
'You will never win a duel if you don't master nonverbal spells, Potter!' he spat at the boy. What was happening to him? His teaching career was undoubtedly over, still... Potter needed to learn, he needed training! Where was he going to get it? It was almost certain that the Dark Lord would take Hogwarts over soon, and Potter would not be able to fnish his education there, nor would his friends. Oh Albus, you left us all far too soon...
What had Albus been thinking? One day in the future, Snape was supposed to tell the boy that he had to die in order to defeat the Dark Lord for good. Now that Potter had witnessed him killing Albus, how was he supposed to make Potter believe him about the fragment of the Dark Lord's soul inside him? Now Potter would surely believe it to be a lie, and a rather pathetic one at that.
'Crucio!' His shield was almost too late this time. If he didn't concentrate, the boy might win this duel in the end, and that mustn't happen. The price he had paid to gain his position as the Dark Lord's most trusted servant had been far too high.
Expelliarmus! His own nonverbal spell brought success instantly. Potter's wand flew high into the air, and with a swift momvement of his arm that would have made any Seeker envious, Snape caught it. 'No Unforgivables from you, Potter!' he commanded. This was definitely no classroom setting, but he couldn't afford to lose any opportunity to train the boy, as absurd as the timing might be. 'You have neither the ability nor the nerve!'
The boy, although disarmed, was far from giving up. Fists raised, he flung himself at Snape Muggle-style. A Jelly-Leg-Jinx dropped him to the ground, cursing. Snape approached him and the boy, unable to stand, sat up and looked into his face.
Snape could see hatred, but no trace of fear in the boy's countenance. ' Kill me, then,' Potter panted. 'Kill me like you killed him, you coward!'
Snape heard the blood thunder in his ears. Coward? When he had just destroyed the only real protector that he had and signed his own death warrant? 'Never... ' - his wand whipped through the air – '... call me a ... ' – another whipping movement of his wand followed, this time in the opposite direction – '... coward!' he hissed furiously. Potter cried out and his hands flew to his face where, on each cheek, an angry red welt had appeared.
Snape lowered his wand. The lashing hex, though not dangerous, was extremely painful. Why had he thrown it at Potter; what had he expected? Potter had seen him kill an unarmed man. His reaction was logical and just a taste of what everybody would be saying. Despair made breathing difficult for a moment.
Potter glanced at his fingers as if checking for blood, then looked accusingly at Snape again. 'Dumbledore trusted you absolutely,' he said, tonelessly.
'Yes, Potter.' Snape's voice was no more than a hoarse whisper. 'He did.'
'How could you!' Potter's voice broke and the indictment in his tone caused a chill to run down Snape's spine. Yes, Potter, I myself wonder how I could. To focus enough to be able to use Avada Kedavra on the one living person I care most about… Albus, I hope you are proud of me, Snape thought bitterly.
'And I trusted you, too.' The boy's soft words were hardly audible. Snape felt a lump in his throat. Not long ago he wouldn't have cared less about Potter's opinion of him, but now he found Potter's disappointment almost unbearable. He longed to shout out that he had been following Dumbledore's orders, but that was out of the question. Potter would never be able to keep that knowledge to himself.
'I did what had to be done,' Snape said quietly, internally wondering if he was already going too far with his cryptic hint, 'as you will have to do one day, Potter.'
Potter still was staring at him, his face a mixture of grief and confusion. 'Professor Dumbledore trusted you absolutely,' he repeated, though his tone was less accusing than before.
Snape wondered if it was possible that he had planted the seed of a doubt in Potter's mind. It would be more than he could have asked for, and maybe already more than it was safe to do. But the vague possibility was a definite, albeit very small, consolation.
Potter opened his mouth, and closed it again, without saying anything. Tears were running down his cheeks as he silently scrutinized Snape, searching for answers in his eyes. Staring into the boy's pale face Snape couldn't ignore the fact how much the boy had matured over the last few months. 'And I am sure, Mr Potter,' he added, 'that when the time comes, you, too, will be able to do what needs to be done.'
Never before had he expressed such confidence in Potter, but in that moment he knew the boy would not shrink back from his duty. Maybe, just maybe, there was still hope for all of them. Well, except for Potter. He was surprised by the intensity of grief he felt at the thought of the inevitability of the boy's death. As to how he was supposed to deliver the Headmaster's last message to Potter, he would have to solve that problem later.
Voices could be heard and he saw a group of people coming out of the castle. There was no time to lose.
Snape raised his wand. Potter had his gaze fixed on him but didn't flinch. 'Finite.' Snape undid the Jelly-Leg-Jinx and threw Potter's wand to the boy. Potter caught it, too bewildered to use it straight away.
Snape looked a last time into the boy's face, desperately hoping it was not the last time he would see the boy alive. There was nothing left to say, or rather, there were hundreds of things to say, but it was too late.
Snape suddenly realized that Albus had been right when he had suggested that Snape tell Potter about his involvement with his mother. Well, that was just another one of the numerous chances he had missed in his life. But this was definitely not the moment. So with a stiff nod to Potter, Snape turned on the spot and Disapparated.

So FINALLY the story is complete. I know it's a rather sad ending and probably not what some of you expected, but given the context, with Voldemort about to take over and a war about to start, I found it rather hard to come up with something cheerful...
As always, reviews are more than welcome, I am really curious to read what you think!What? The Fort Bend School District Is Looking At Cutting Back On Instruction Days?
If there's one thing Houston school district superintendent Terry Grier likes to do, it's hold meetings. Marathon meetings.
At today's get-together with the school board, a whole slew of various subjects came up.
As he was talking about budget cuts and how HISD plans to deal with them, Grier took some time to make a startling announcement and pat himself on the back a bit.
"The Fort Bend school district is talking about lowering the number of days in the school calendar," he said, while HISD is looking to increase theirs.
What? Fort Bend is dealing with its own budget crisis by cutting the school calendar? That should get people riled up out there, right?
It possibly could, if it were true.
We asked the district if any proposals were under discussion to cut the school calendar or the school week.
"We are not considering either of the things you mention," spokeswoman Mary Ann Simpson says.
She sent along what she called "the minor adjustments we are making in regard to transportation" to deal with costs.
The changes do change the start/stop times of schools, but not the length of the day. And they make some students walk farther to the stops, and are aimed partly at having each bus carry more kids.
HISD, by the way, is contemplating its own cuts/changes in its transportation set-up, in order to reducePress Releases

STRATEGIC INITIATIVES
The Ohio Benefit Bank (OBB), one of the Foundation’s strategic investments, reached a remarkable milestone—helping Ohio’s working poor access more than $1 billion in benefits and tax credits. Over the past seven years, the Foundation and its donors have granted more than $3.1 million to help OBB expand to include access for free tax filing, federal student aid, Veteran’s benefits, nutrition assistance, and childcare benefits.
The Weinland Park Collaborative was launched in 2010 and includes many partners working with The Columbus Foundation, including Cardinal Health, JPMorgan Chase Foundation, The Ohio State University, Campus Partners, The City of Columbus, and United Way of Central Ohio.

Casey Foundation to improve the lives of children and their families. Six million dollars awarded in state and federal historic tax credits to save 23 buildings on East 11th Avenue also boosted the revitalization effort.

The Rockaway Chamber of Commerce and Sky Festival Productions put in a lot of work organizing this festival, and it shows.
I was concerned that the front desk of the motel would close before I
got there as my flight arrived a couple of hours late on Friday evening
and the motel sounded like a small family place. I called Roger
Chewning on his cell phone and he somehow kept from laughing when he
said that the desk would be open late. I was still clueless when I
checked in. In fact I asked if they had a luggage cart. They did not.
It finally dawned on me just what most of this motel's customers were up
to when I turned on the tv and stumbled across the free porn
channel. They did not have a luggage cart because most of their
customers did not have any luggage. Heck, most of the women did not
even have purses!
The hotel looked like a nice, normal lodging establishment, maybe the bullet proof glass at the front desk or the posted rate for a five hour stay should have tipped me off. By the way, just to be perfectly clear. Those are KITEFLIERS in front of the hotel.
The hotel staff did try and be helpful to these strange guests that they had. When presented with the odd request for a washcloth, they tore a towel up into four pieces for one of the kitefliers.
Someone else trying to be helpful, reconfigured our coat hanger antenna into a different configuration each morning. Might the culprit be lurking behind the van?
After watching the limos pick up the working girls in the morning, we
headed out to the field. Ron and Sandy Gibian, Jose Sainz, Iqbal Husain, JoAnn Weber and I were invited guests, and we were ready to
put on a show. We waited out the morning doldrums and soon we had wind.
The beach at Rockaway came alive with kites big and small.
I must apologize to the sport kite fliers, they also had a sport kite competition here. However, once I put my kites
up, I see little else but the single line field, I can not say much
about the event. From my vantage point all I saw were sport kites as
they made it to the top of their window.
However, I did see many wonderful single line creations, such as this
piece by Jose Sainz. Jose makes some of my favorite small(er) kites.
He also flew this piece that just happens to be the Grand National Champion!
Another apology has to go out to JoAnn Weber, I don't have a single picture of her kites that is in focus! Sorry to all of the readers too, they were wonderful kites.
Pete Dolphin flew a great train of Pyro Deltas which lifter a large
American Flag. It was very well received by this particular audience.
Pete also flew his ever popular Moon. I love these kites, I just hate the number of spars. I think that I will leave these to Pete. A slight lack of kite building skill on my part also enters into this decision. ;-)
While we are on the subject of Pete Dolphin, I know what is going on in this picture, but the reality is too boring for this image. Let me know your ideas as to what Pete is doing, if we get any wildly improper ideas, I will print them out with the picture and post it at Convention.
Ron and Sandy Gibian brought their wonderful art kites. Here you see them up close prior to launch
Sandy decided to model the bow from a fruit basket. It was getting quite hot out, that might explain it.
Beatrix Pelton spent part of the day flying Iqbal's Hamburger and fries
centipede. It was pointed out that she was the best looking kite anchor on the field. Beatrix actually spent most of her time helping the event.
And then there were my kites. The Octopus and Trilobite flew well until
a big gust arrived to scare the life out of me. The gust lifted the
sand anchors for the Octopus out of their holes and the kite and anchors
proceeded to head for the sunbathers and the water. Fortunately, Roger
Chewning had the field ringed with rope, not safety tape. The anchors
tangled with the rope. Unfortunately, the Octopus started pulling fence
posts out out the sand and I started to visualize people getting whacked
with fence posts as the Octopus went out to sea. Several of us caught
up with the anchors at this point and managed to stabilize thing and get
both big kites down. After I stopped shaking, we added more anchors and
put the Octopus back up. The only damage for the day is a small hole in
the octopus and my nerves. I have never had anything like this happen
before, and I never want it to happen again
Many thanks to Paul Keeler, Glen Bachman, Pauli Berard, Jose Sainz, Ron
Gibian and many others who helped.
My kites did fly for most of both days without incident.
On Sunday I was joined by Gary Engvall and we stacked our Trilobites.
The Lehigh Valley Kite Society helped me all weekend, from the near disaster with the octopus, to lugging bags and digging holes and everything in between. Thanks again to these generous people.
And they flew some big stuff themselves. Here, although it is hard to tell scale in this image, is a really big FlowForm. It flew most of the weekend lifting a variety of laundry/
It seems appropriate to end this report with an image of the first big kite up on
Sunday morning. It was Roger Chewning showing us all up in the light winds with
his Jordon AirForm. It did not stay up long, but it filled the sky in the light morning winds.
However, I did see many wonderful single line creations, such as this
piece by Jose Sainz. Jose makes some of my favorite small(er) kites.
He also flew this piece that just happens to be the Grand National Champion!
Many thanks to Paul Keeler, Glen Bachman, Pauli Berard, Jose Sainz, Ron
Gibian and many others who helped.

KidSpirit is the only youth organization to have won in a category not restricted to youth.
The Wilbur Awards are awarded by the Religion Communicators Council, the oldest professional public relations organization in the country. The annual awards honor excellence by individuals in secular media – print and online journalism, book publishing, broadcasting, and motion pictures – in communicating religious issues, positive values, and themes.
KidSpirit’s Interfaith Connections column was created with the express intention of fostering dialogue to encourage greater mutual respect and understanding among young people from diverse religious backgrounds. Each quarter, three young writers of different faith backgrounds and spiritual traditions address a question posed by an all-youth Editorial Board relating to KidSpirit’s current theme.
The winning articles from KidSpirit’s 2013 Interfaith Connections department were published in the God Issue. They include a dialogue co-authored by two teenage girls in California, an observant Muslim and a “non-religious half-Asian”; an essay by a young writer from Maryland, who recently transitioned from home-school to a Quaker school, on integrating his exploration of science and spirituality into his Hindu practice; and a piece by a 13-year-old in Maine who is a young example of the demographic known as “nones”—those who are religiously unaffiliated but who may also feel a deep spiritual yearning.
KidSpirit won its first Wilbur Award in 2012 in the Youth Books category for its compilation volume, the Best of KidSpirit Online, Volume 1. An unaffiliated, non-profit quarterly, KidSpirit Magazine empowers youth to explore questions of meaning through original essays, poetry, and artwork, and supports their development into world citizens with strong inner grounding. The Editorial Board chooses themes and edits submissions each month. KidSpirit is in regular syndication on the Huffington Post, and has been honored by a rare combination of religious, educational, and parenting awards. For more information, see KidSpirit’s website.

The restaurant had used the song, with the chorus modified to "M-M-M-My Verona," for several years as a theme song on its web site and other online venues, according to local residents and former company employees.
Among other things, the song served as a soundtrack to a video montage shot inside the restaurant, including clips of a plate of wood-grilled beef tenderloin, hand-cut pasta and a glimpse of the restaurant's collection of more than 240 varieties of wine. As of Friday afternoon, two weeks after Wasendorf was arrested at an Iowa hospital, the video was still available on YouTube and the restaurant's web site.
Wasendorf never contacted the authors of the song or the copyright owners and did not pay for the right to use it commercially, according to a letter sent by an attorney representing Knack bandmates Berton Averre and Doug Fieger, the song's authors.
."1,100 overseas ballots rejected
TALLAHASSEE - More than 1,100 overseas absentee ballots were thrown out yesterday as Republicans complained of a coordinated challenge by Democrats, particularly against ballots from military personnel.
In some counties, half or nearly all of the ballots were rejected, many of them military ballots that apparently did not have postmarks. Orange County, for example, rejected 117 of its 147 overseas ballots.
With a handful of counties still counting, more than 1,500 overseas votes had been accepted statewide.
“The party of the man who wants to be the next commander-in-chief is trying to throw out the votes of the men and women he will be commanding,” charged Jim Post, a Republican lawyer in Duval County, where 107 ballots were rejected.
“We had a lot of ballots with no postmarks; so we had to declare them invalid,” said Dick Carlberg, assistant elections supervisor in Duval County.
Thomas Spencer, a Miami attorney for Texas Gov. George W. Bush, said the GOP legal team will weigh whether to sue this weekend. “One of the problems with those ballots is it is so difficult under Florida and federal law that you almost have to be a rocket scientist to comply,” he said.
Democrats dismissed the GOP suggestions of a coordinated campaign, noting local election officials made the decisions. “Rushing to a hasty conclusion and making partisan accusations is exactly what we don't need right now,” Democratic National Committee spokeswoman Jenny Backus said.
Earlier this week, Mark Herron, a Tallahassee lawyer helping shepherd Democratic presidential election lawsuits through the local courts, sent a five-page letter to Democratic attorneys throughout Florida giving them tips on how to lodge protests against overseas ballots.
Such protests must be lodged before the ballot is taken out of the envelope. The letter focused on protesting military ballots, which are assumed to be heavily in favor of Mr. Bush, and included a section on military postmarks.
Mr. Herron said in an interview that his five-page letter “went to the folks we had in the field that were out there monitoring absentee ballots, just like the other side was out there. Our memo was intended to express the law of the state of Florida as we understand it and provide direction and guidance to the people who were in the field.
“I'm not the only one that did this,” he added. “Everybody got the opportunity to argue their case in front of the canvassing boards.”
Republicans circulated a letter dated yesterday from Navy Capt. E.M. DuCom, deputy director of the military postal service, who said military mail is required to be postmarked. But he added, “There are instances when time constraints do not allow for proper postmarking/cancellation of the mail. The last flight may be departing the ship and the mail has to get on it.”
Ed Gillespie, a Republican strategist working for Mr. Bush in Florida, said 110 of 113 write-in ballots, mostly from military forces, were invalidated by officials in Miami-Dade County. He said more than half were thrown out because they had no witness or witness address listed, but “the form doesn't indicate that a witness is necessary.”
With returns from 65 of 67 counties, Mr. Bush picked up 1,057 votes and Mr. Gore 597, giving the Republican a 760-vote statewide lead - up from 300 when the day began.
Counties have until noon today to report their overseas ballot results to Secretary of State Katherine Harris, who will not be able to certify the election until after the Florida Supreme Court meets Monday to hear arguments about ongoing hand recounts in South Florida.Infinite Energy Press has announced the publication of a new book on LENR by Dr. Edmund Storms, a nuclear scientist retired from the Los Alamos National Laboratory.
The Explanation of Low Energy Nuclear Reaction: An Examination of the Relationship between Observation and Explanation will be published on July 7th. The publicity material for the book explains that Dr..”
Mike McKubre of SRI International who writes the foreword of the book, is full of praise for Dr. Storms and the book and makes particular note that chapter 5 of the book contains “the first physical science based description of a potential explanation for cold fusion.”
I expect this book will be widely read by current researchers and theoreticians in the field, and I think it could be of interest to people just beginning to pay attention to LENR. The lack of an accepted theoretical basis of LENR has proven to be one of the largest stumbling blocks to the scientific community’s acceptance of it as a valid field of study, and the sooner the underlying phenomenon of LENR is understood the better, from the perspective of research and development. This sounds like an important contribution from Edmund Storms.

Ok, not quite. But, strangely, antidepressants on top of stress hormones may be stronger than they are alone. Why is this? And what's going on? Well, we're not quite sure.
David et al. "Neurogenesis-dependent and -indepdendent effects of fluoxetine in an animal model of anxiety/depression" Neuron, 2009.
The most commonly prescribed antidepressant (and antianxiety) medications out there are the SSRI, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. These include drugs like fluoxetine (Prozac), citalopram (Celexa), or sertraline (Zoloft). How these drugs work, however, is still up for debate. At first, everyone thought that, because these drugs increase levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin in the brain, that depression must be caused by low levels of serotonin, and the increase would make you feel better. We have since learned that this is not the case. Headaches don't result from lack of aspirin, and depression doesn't result from lack of serotonin.
The next theory for how depression, and antidepressants, might work was the neurogenesis theory. We used to believe that you were born with all the neurons you'd ever have, but we now know that neurogenesis, the birth of new neurons, occurs throughout life in areas of the brain like the hippocampus, an area usually associated with learning and memory. Antidepressants can increase neurogenesis, on a time course which matches the clinical efficacy of antidepressants.
But now we are starting to think that it might be more complicated than that. What about, for example, the role of stress? People with depression often present with elevated levels of stress hormone (cortisol in humans, corticosterone in rodents), and treating animals with corticosterone can induce symptoms that we associate with a depressive-like state. But does this affect whether, and how, antidepressant works?
To find this out, David et al treatment a bunch of mice with corticosterone in their drinking water. This is the hormone released in response to stress, and can create one very stressed out mouse. took half of those mice, and added an antidepressant (either fluoxetine or imipramine), ON TOP of the corticosterone treatment.
Doesn't that look better. You can see that adding Prozac increased the time the animals spent in the open field and made their novelty suppressed feeding measures shorter. Antidepressants were able to repair the state produced by corticosterone alone.
But what about the neurogenesis?
This is where it got funny. find this out,.
So it looks like the fluoxetine is most effective when combined with corticosterone, or exposure to stress. This becomes important when you take into account that 80% of people diagnosed with major depressive disorder report symptoms after a significant life stress. It may be the stress itself that helps to make antidepressants more effective, which could become important in the clinic if we could use levels of stress hormone to determine who will respond to antidepressants and who won't. But while beta arrestin 2 might play a role in this, it is probably not the only player, and the real mechanism remains a mystery.According to Taylor's obituary, he served his country during the Vietnam War from 1967 to 1969 and was discharged with the Medal of Honor, Purple Heart and other honors.Read Taylor's complete obituary for information about survivors and funeral arrangements, and you can sign his guest book.

In her ruling, Circuit Court Judge Marie Williams wrote that Benson had every right to make his statements about Bassam Issa, owner of ANT Group, within his role as a council member.
"The Court finds that City Council's scope of authority extends beyond the limited window of open council meetings," Williams wrote.
Benson said Friday he was not surprised by the ruling.
"I knew when the judge saw the facts she would know it's a frivolous lawsuit," he said.
Issa sued Benson in February after trying to get a tract of land rezoned so he could build an IHOP. Benson did not support the proposal, saying it went against the area's land-use plan. The council later voted not to grant the rezoning.
In the lawsuit, Issa claimed Benson defamed him by telling council members that Issa had tried to offer Benson a bribe.
Benson said he knew Issa could appeal the ruling, but he thinks any kind of appeal would be a "waste of time and money."
Issa said Friday he was considering an appeal.
"I'm talking to my lawyer right now," he said.
Williams stated in her opinion that, as a council member, Benson has privileges to talk about issues facing the council and those privileges extend beyond the council chambers. She stated that all Benson's statements specifically dealt with the rezoning case and that he could talk with others about that case.
Travis McDonough, Benson's attorney, said Friday it was important that the law uphold the council members' rights.
"The law protects good people willing to serve their community from lawsuits like this one," he said. "This result will allow Councilman Benson to focus his efforts on public service rather than litigation."NASA's responses to comments received on the Final EA can be viewed by clicking here.

For some folks, just going out and hiking a trail doesn't compete with smart phones and laptops, Facebook and video games. But what if exploring a park meant using a high-tech gadget to search for hidden treasure? That's the idea behind the Midpeninsula Regional Open Space District's new Preserve Circuit Geo-Challenge.I’m a lady who needs her coffee. Sure, I know how to make it at home and often do, by the carafe-full. Sometimes, however, life requires you to head to a coffee shop where a barista will whip up a nice caffeinated beverage for your enjoyment. Ahhhh, frothy 2%.
Of course the problem with these shops, are the pastries. The gluten-laden, deceptively delicious-looking, muffins, scones, donuts, and cakes. Thus far, not one of the 15 coffee houses in my area have gotten the memo about the 1 in 133 of us who might not want to live in their bathroom after ingesting a chocolate chip scone.
This means bringing in your own food, at the risk of being busted or shamed by your douche bag husband. (Note: Not MY husband. He’s got not a shred of douche-baggery and provides useful pockets for this venture. I know, I’m a lucky woman.)
Since it’s your god-given right to enjoy a latte, macchiato, wet cappuccino, or a double espresso whenever, and wherever you want, you’ll be excused for assuming you can do whatever the hell you want in these establishments. Excused by me, maybe not the owner who worked hard perfecting her hazelnut muffin. Which is why you have to sneak your gluten-free goods. Here’s how.
1. Travel Crumbless
Forget the gluten-free croissant (mostly because they don’t even exist), go for something dense like the gluten-free lemon poppy cake you see being unsheathed from my trench coat above. Keep it clean, Celiacs.
2. Don’t Look Guilty
Hey, you’ll starve to death if you’re never allowed to eat inside a coffee shop, amiright? No? Well, you might get a little bit peaked. So don’t act like you’re doing anything wrong when you order your almond milk latte, no matter how big the gluten-free baguette is sticking out of your computer bag.
3. Mind the Lighting
The darker, the better, and the more antiques stacked in corners the more places to hide your muffin. No one is going to get up in your business if they can’t even tell what it is you’re doing under your coat over there.
So go forth Celiacs! Spread your gf pastry around town.
Do you ever sneak gluten-free food into dining establishments? How do you do it?

A few of the Charbucks I’ve been to sell actually-digestible, mostly-palatable gluten-free snack-bar-type thingies (heck, there’s a local movie theater that offers gluten-free cookies; what’s cool is that the price is actually quite reasonable–for a movie theater–so it hardly feels like we’re being gouged for having to be gluten-free, just for buying crap at the movies).
The irony is that I’m not into anything else Charbucks sells. My wife and friends are. I guess the real irony is that now I enjoy it there more, since there’s at least one thing I want to have that I get to have (versus all of the stuff I could have had but never wanted).
Where do you live? Because mine doesn’t sell one damn gluten-free thing.
We live near Dallas, which–though I think Dallas is not a bad city to live near for some things–I don’t necessarily recommend.
I have definitely snuck gluten free foods into numerous places. Coffee shops, restaurants, movie theatres, even Glen Ivy Day Spa in Corona. (What? It was my birthday. And while they have delicious salads and even gluten free bagels (!), they do not have gluten free chocolate cake. I mean, a girl only turns 30 once.) Sometimes it’s blatant (like at an Iranian restaurant in San Diego – I brought warmed kinnickinnick pizza crust in a tupperware container to eat with hummus, since pita is out.) Sometimes it’s more discreet – but scratch that, it’s pretty much always blatant. If the manager has a problem, I’ll tell them that I will buy gluten free cheerios from them if they sell them, but until then, leave me and my auto-immune disorder alone.
I also sneak wine into movie theatres, but that’s a whole different story.
You go, gluten-free girl! You might be my new hero.
Our *bucks has the kind bars & other chip-y style things. Too bad they only had the orange gluten free cake thing like a day three years ago. BUT the *bucks in Ireland carries GF brownies! (Though open in their case with the other goodies. ) And ooh I had no idea Glen Ivy had GF bagels. Now I’ll have to justify a trip back to my fave spa just for that! ;)
I have been gf for 7 years now, so my memory is a bit faded, but this bakery is near me and I think their croissants are pretty convincing (if you can overlook the shape)

Fortunately, my last final is on the 22nd of November and I do not fly back unti l the 29th so I have a whole week to travel around Australia. My Aussie partner in crime, Meghan, and I are planning on taking a road-trip south to Brisbane. I have always wanted to see the Australia Zoo, which is just outside of the city. Of course, there will be plenty of beaches to stop and surf at along the way. Hopefully, I’ll still have enough time to squeeze in a dive on the GBR before I leave.
In other news, I am the proud borrowee of a snazzy 50cc scooter for the next few weeks! It has cut my travel time to work, well anywhere in Townsville for that matter, substantially. Granted I am all for reducing my carbon footprint, but in this case it is an hour walk to the rink and its not located in the best of areas. Plus, the bus system isn’t to reliable in Townsville and I’ve come to the conclusion “hail-n-ride” is a myth.
Now if I could just remember what side of the road to drive down…
One more thought before I have to head to class. The highlight of my weekend was by far catching a glimpse of Tina Fey’s SNL Palin/Couric interview skit. I had already seen the real interview, and I have to say, with all political bias put to the side, Fey’s parody is pretty amazing!

That was in the specific context of answering Karen's question, on whether there were cases of LD that was not in RDF out already there. And, yes, even if I wouldn't like it to appear in the report, I believe that the more of the LD methodology you would want to implement, the more useful something that *look like* RDF will be. I'm not saying that it should be RDF, but just that it could be likened to RDF. In particular, if you want to *link* entities within the data, it will be difficult to escape the notion of typed relation. If a connection is made in the raw data it will usually come with some form of semantics. If MARC records contain URIs, I'd expect it would be really easy to generate some RDF from it, no? But well, otherwise I think I agree with you on the fundamental points that you make--I mean, much more fundamental than my devising on comparison between data models.

Is it useful as a transition to a more broadly useful technology? > > We collectively may think that's nuts, but that doesn't mean that under the broader definition of linked data it's not feasible or desirable or of benefit to the community. It certainly fits with TBL's "raw data now" message and the definition of Linked Data in the two most seminal Linked Open Data papers: > > > > I think we should be far more careful than we have been so far about drawing conclusions about library data and how it could best be expressed, distributed, and aggregated in a linked data (not an exclusively RDF) environment.

We may collectively view the data with some distaste, but the Library Community already has methods in place for distributed maintenance, publishing, even identification of data. Authority control, ISBN, ISSN, DOI, and many other methods of collective, shared and even (textually) linking data have been enthusiastically embraced by libraries for years. MARBI has made recent efforts to provide for the inclusion of URIs in marc21 records.

Ted Danson, the actor who won two Emmys for his role as Sam Malone on "Cheers," will join the cast of "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation" in the fall. He'll be the big boss, stepping in after the departure of Lawrence Fishburne.
Our television blog Showtracker explains that Danson "will play the new CSI supervisor, who previously ran the crime lab in Portland."
Even with the new "CSI" responsibilities, Danson will continue to portray the louche editor on HBO's "Bored to Death," which he does with relish. "'Bored to Death' is pretty much my favorite thing in life," he told me earlier this year. "I love the writing, love my character.... It's really some of my favorite stuff I’ve ever been involved with."
Danson is used to wearing multiple hats. He's been a longtime ocean activist and published an environmental book this year, "Oceana."
"I've always been kind of a shill," Ted Danson explained. "The guy out in front of the tent saying, 'Thank you so much for watching "Cheers," come on in and let me introduce you to the marine biologists who have something really important to tell you.'"
He's overly modest -- the book is educational, informative and cool to look at, with bright and clear diagrams about fish populations, oil drilling and more. "The thing that I think gets people’s attention, hopefully, is that this is a problem that’s fixable. It’s a huge environmental disaster in the making that doesn’t have to happen," Danson told me. "We can change this. And you can be part of that, and that’s part of what the book talks about, is you can be part of this, even in your crazy busy day when you barely have any time. You can go on the computer and join Oceana, or not even join, just become a Wavemaker and allow them to turn you into an e-activist that will change policy around the world."
Even while you're watching "CSI," I bet.

I think veal would go under beef. What about duck? Or Cornish Hens? Some sort of fresh pasta, maybe with some kind of pork sausage?

I agree that chicken isn't always boring, but what about using another foul but something a little less everyday -- duck would be my top choice, otherwise quail or game hen, are all sexier than chicken. I recently made duck breasts with a pomegranate reduction made with sesame oil, soy, garlic and shallots that were really delicious.

We were all lamenting the fact that it's so hard to find *normal* Catholics who simply believe what the Church teaches, and don't want to politicize it, and who don't want to attach oneself to some guru. What exhausting times we live in.
Oh, Lord, ain't that the truth!
Or, as oddly enough, I JUST wrote to a friend about some local more-Catholic-than-the-pope types:
"What they're doing is piling the cultural and intellectual (if you can call it that) pathologies of evangelical and fundamentalist Protestantism on top of Catholicism's already-existing pathologies.
"Yep. They're PROTESTANTIZING the Catholic Church in their blind quest for this 'authentic,' puritanical 'Catholicism' that doesn't exist and never did, except in these folks' imaginations. A lot of what they see as 'authentic' is actually deeply heretical -- Jansenism, that Catholic version of Puritanism.
"And in chasing after the latest and greatest apologists or speakers or teachers -- like the near deification of Scott Hahn and Mother Angelica, for example -- this type of Catholic is just aping another evangelical Protestant pathology . . . following the newest and trendiest 'guru.'"

I am learning the importance of evaluating the tone of what is said by my fellow Catholics and my other Christian brethren, not just the content. I think every God loving/God fearing woman and man wants to be on the side of truth. But I get annoyed when the tone of the message obscures the Lord, especially if it involves piddling over minutiea. Correct doctrine has its value, but it also can distract if it becomes out of balance.
Posted by: Tom Mohan | September 01, 2003 at 01:35 AM
This bit of LUMEN GENTIUM cribbed from the Catechism goes a bit deeper than "tone", Tom, but it's cutting in a similar direction: "Even though incorporated into the Church, one who does not however persevere in charity is not saved. He remains indeed in the bosom of the Church, but 'in body' not 'in heart'" (paragraph 837)----fr. j.

But I am not cut out for the movements. I have deep concerns about some of them, and others just leave me cold. I find stories about how a particular movement has come into parishes and tried to take them over to be chilling in the implicit gnosticism present (you know, we're the *real* Catholics). It's a real dilemma for Catholics like me.? On the other hand, what if you don't cotton to the authoritarianism in some of the movements' spiritualities, or don't find the founder's writings to be all that profound or interesting? You end up on the outside, permanently, functioning as a sort of Protestantized Catholic ("just me and God and the Sacraments"), and waiting for better times. The scandal has just about done me in for good on the idea of ever getting more involved in parish life. My wife fusses at me for this, but I have been left so filled with anger and mistrust by the scandal that I don't have it in me to trust parish life, especially parish life with my son. I have such anxiety over this.
If anybody's got a better idea, I'd love to hear it.

There is no such thing as a "just plain Catholic" who is Catholic at all. There are just plain Quakers, just plain agnostics and just plain Buddhists, because that's how those things are, but no "just plain Catholics."
Usually the people I meet who claim to be "just plain Catholics" are seeking to:
1) avoid any discussion, growth, challenge or commitment whatsoever (as in I like my ideas, they're as good as your ideas--all ideas are equally good, and that's howcome I can be a "just plain Catholic." It is "just plain because *just plain* is all I accept of it."
2) OR seek to disobey everyone outside their little circle of confreres at the local beloved parish (as in "just plain me, I don't see why I can't use birth control; Father so-and-so lets me because he's so modern; what does the Pope know about sex; I dont mean any evil; how can it cause any harm; that doesn't apply to me anyway, I'm not meant to be a saint; I'm just me and God loves the stuff I do even if the Church teaches otherwise but they're WRONG, etc.)
3) OR don't know anything, not anything, and think that's ok, even when non knowing extends to not knowing the basics of the Faith. (as in it's just as simple as "love one another" and that's it--so I can cheat, lie, fornicate, cheat the living heck out of everyone as long as I can say I love them emotionally at the end of the day?)
The fact of the matter is that being Catholic is not a tiny little cozy thing that is "just plain." It's not a "little ol' country-boy-me thing."

Rod, that's exactly what drives those Catholics into some of the movements. You are not a *just plain* Catholic seeking to deny everything for the sake of comfort and acceptability and they usually aren't either. However, not everyone belongs in one of those movements....
I am a convert, and like you, have a trust problem nowdays. It's hard not to anymore. I'm still working this one out myself...

There is some help in the loosely strung together local *network,* which includes some people from the movements as well as others. We work/pray/help each other calmly to get some improvement and understanding across in our diocese and enhance fidelity, knowledge of the Faith, and love of God. It's not a political thing really--it's more of a labor of real love. Maybe this sort of thing is what you are looking for.

Actually, there are some Catholics who think. As Gary Wills said in his book, "Papal Sin" it is hard to believe in and represent an organization with some of the positions of the Catholic Church. The scandal of the Bishops handling of the pedophile priests should give any sensible person pause. I think the observation that there are not any "normal Catholics" anymore is a sign that the Holy Spirit is working in the church.

Rod Dreher: "I have such anxiety over this."
Indeed, Rod, you express yourself very well. From reading what you say, your deep anxiety is very palpable for me. It makes me sad how some people harshly criticize you.
How I wish there was something that I could say that would help you, but alas there isn't.

If this is indeed the Vatican's position, the score at the end of the third quarter is Gates of Hell 27, Catholic Church 10.
It's gonna be a close one, folks.
What this position will encourage is a fracturing of the Church even more profound than the present situation, which we thought couldn't get worse. Well, ah reckon it can.
Obviously, the answer to the question "Who is my neighbor?" is a group of people who generally look like me, think like me and have the same spiritual and theological predilections as me. And this is the kind of thinking that will lead to an even more profound Protestantization of the Church.
No longer is Jesus enough. No longer are tradition and scripture enough. No, now we're just going to be chasing after gurus and having such snippets as "Oh, he's so GOOD!" and "Do you have the latest (fill in the blank) tape?" and "Well, (fill in the blank) came out against (fill in the blank), you know" become a regular part of Catholic conversation.
What is happening in the Church today (and this is something that's been going on a long time now) is the dissassembling of all the checks and balances that are supposed to keep us from going off the deep end. What we're going to end up with are a bunch of "popes" and no accountability to (or unity with) each other or Catholic doctrine.
Rod, listen to your wife and get involved in your parish. After 20 years of marriage, I can tell you that it is easier to listen to your wife now and make it look like your idea than it is to admit you were wrong later.
Parish life -- living in COMMUNITY -- is how we live out the sacraments. And if we find ourselves unable to engage or evangelize in our parishes, how then can we ever hope to impact the world?
Parish life is what the Church started with, and the way things are going, it soon enough may be all we have left. I ASSURE YOU that my parish, at least, is CHOCK FULL of people just as pissed-off at and mistrustful of our corrupt hierarchy as you and I are. It is together that we commiserate and find ways to endure.
And it is together that we suffer for the sins of the bishops and the chickenhawk priests. For example, at my parish, a whole bunch of us now have to take "safe environments" training and undergo background checks because we work with young people as staff or volunteers.
And it is together that we find this state of affairs deeply galling and deeply ironic, given that we are being given these edicts by an archdiocese that hasn't exactly busted a gut protecting its youth from deviant priests. Especially when many of us now put in the position of proving our "fitness" HAVE gone to the wall to blow the whistle on the archdiocese concerning this subject in at least one instance.
In short, what the Catholic Church desperately needs now is accountablilty. Accountability begins in your parish.

David, your comment betrays a deep trust in God and His Holy Spirit. I think you are right. We are in a time of turmoil and transition, and must walk by faith and not by sight. Charity is lacking in so much of what I read and hear on every side. I hear many pharisaical voices.
James, that very word--"jansenism"--has flitted through my head when the Pope is being "out-Catholiced" by some over the top sort or other. That is sad to me, because then I think that their vision of God is not the God of amazing, fathomless mercy--(and that falls so far short)--how I wish that we could love each other more and obsess less!
Just a thought, Rod, but in "movements" are you including more traditional oblate, lay or third orders, such as Secular Franciscans, Lay Carmelites, etc?
Posted by: Denise | September 01, 2003 at 02:27 PM
One of the great pastoral initiatives of this pope has been to not only foster the various movements (many of them lay) but to work to bring them together as well so that they know they are just part of a bigger whole: the Catholic Church. I think the Church has had "movements" and "ways" since the earliest centuries and holding them together in unity hasn't been easy at times but has been accomplished in a remarkable way as well.
If one reads the Pope's Apostolic Letter written as the New Millennium began he speaks of parishes as centers - but of prayer and mysticism and HOLINESS. I don't think "Rome" has given up on parishes at all; but has decided to foster the movements and ways as a major manifestation of the grace of Pentecost in our own times.
And even if one doesn't "join" one can nurture one's own faith by some of the insights brought forth and lived by each. And, as someone else suggests, there are the traditional groups of Third Orders that are quite strong today, thanks be to God.

I'm with Gerald on the centrality of parish life for Catholics, but I understand very well Rod's distress and Amy's. I myself, while I admire many of the trans-parochial "movements" (and I've got good friends in Opus Dei), I don't feel especially drawn to any of them. For one thing, many of them strike me as very much fixated on the personalities of their founders and prime movers. There is something distastefully cultish about even the best of them, and the movements tend to foster the position that if you don't belong, you're not a real Catholic. The aggressive apologetics about many of the movements turns me off as well; their leaders, many of whom are converts, seem to devote most of their energy into proselytizing more converts, and they sometimes betray an ill-concealed disdain for the overly tolerant ways of us cradle Catholics who have to deal on a day-to-day basis with Uncle Dave's newfound atheism or Sister Sue's blithe announcement that she's on the pill.
Furthermore, many of the movements have interlocking directorates and operate as mutual backscratching societies for each other's power-brokering goals. Related to this problem is the fact that many of the movements are perpetually in search of money, trying to tap into the same small pool of rich conservative Catholics with funds to donate. For eight months I edited a conservative Catholic magazine, and I quit and decided to return to graduate school when I realized that I would never be able to escape the pressure from the movement people to tailor stories to promote their own interests--not to mention the huffy phone calls from movement celebrities when I'd run a book review that didn't admire their latest book unreservedly. I believe everything the Catholic church teaches, from the divinity of Christ to the ban on artificial birth control. Yet I felt lonely and quasi-heretical because I couldn't buy into the movements and like Rod, could summon up no interest whatsoever in the writings of their founders. Mother Angelica's a fine woman, but frankly, I'd rather watch "Seinfeld" reruns than the talking heads of EWTN. For spiritual reading, I'll take "The Imitation of Christ," thank you.
Contra Rod's observation that the Vatican has pulled its support from the parishes to foster the movements, it strikes me that the future of the life of the church--not to mention the sanity of non-movement trad Catholics like me--lies in reinvigorated parish life. And I don't know who's behind it, but this reinvigoration seems to be occurring at least in places, as more parishes revive traditional devotions and there seems to be an honest effort to improve the dignity of the liturgy. Nearly all younger priests these days are religious conservatives, and that's a good thing. What we Catholics who are not professional Catholics need desperately is the liturgy and the sacraments, and they are things that only the parishes can provide.

I don't quite know how to take the comment that spawned this thread, but I agree with those who have commented that the parish remains the key structure to the Church's mission in society. Alas, it is true that parishes are often moribund but I think that is beginning to change. It will change very quickly if lay catholics take up the Pope's challenge in his letter Novo Millennio Ineunte referred to by Mr. Serafin. Indeed the parishes would no longer be recognizable. As for the various mouvements and gurus, as long as they are in line within the magisterial teaching of the Church I think the proper catholic stance should be live and let live. If it is not your cup of tea, it's not your cup of tea, what of it? On the other hand, I have little patience for Spirit-killing dissent which does no end of harm to the the Church founded by Jesus.

I was a member of the Charismatic Renewal Movement and it gave me a good foundation and teachings. But as time went on, I found prayer meetings to be burdensome and would rather go to Mass instead. So I did. Daily Mass. There, a community can begin because the same people tend to go. But community has been tried doing this and that. In the end, community happens when we are involved in each others' lives. The question is how to get there. I would like to be with people who have the same focus as I do. Otherwise there is no connection. I think the movements try to renew people so they can then go out and be community with each other and others. The fault lies where the movement itself becomes the most important thing. Not what the movement stood for to begin with. In the Charismatic Renewal, we were taught about making Jesus the center of our life instead of anything else. We needed to learn what that meant, and that would be to go through a period of practical live-out instruction by mentoring with someone. Once we have our feet on the ground, we can move into our world. So now I would say that I belong to the Charismatic Renewal but not the movement. I need people for support, though, and the most likely people would be those who were in the movement also. There's a whole group of us that are scattered around and who keep in touch with each other in support. But we don't do any structured things. We have tried to bring our faith into the Church body and Sacraments. But there is a place for people to be able to go to to be renewed in their Catholic Faith. Somebody has to do the Cursillo thing, or the Life in the Spirit thing. That is one ministry. There needs follow-up. Those who go through RCIA need follow-up the same for a long time to come. They are babies in the Lord and they need support and guidance. Something the Church doesn't stress. It becomes the focus of the movements then to take up that call. The temptation is to form a closed group which becomes its own "church", if you will.
The Church tends to take for granted that the people who show up for church know how to live-out their life as Christians. They don't. They are formed by the world, the media. There is so much work that has to be done that maybe the movements are very necessary to hopefully bring it about, as long as they move out beyond themselves so that the movement then almost dissolves itself and blends into the parishes.

With regard to the Vatican's statement on parish life, I recall reading somewhere that one Vatican official observed that in parts of Western Europe, parish life was "essentially dead." This observation was made about places like France, Belgium and Austria where, unfortunately, religious observance has fallen so far that the old communities were no longer cohesive or workable. I think this observation was made as sort of a realistic assessment of sad situation. I don't think the church is "pulling its support" from parish life. And I don't think the observation is really valid for the US or Latin America or even Poland.
Posted by: John Sheridan | September 02, 2003 at 09:27 AM
The parish church is what it's all about. Let's face it: to have good parishes, you need good priests. To have good priests, you need good bishops. To have good bishops, ... well, I'll leave it at that.
If Rome is ignoring the Real church, and focussing on "movements," ecumenical pep rallies, jubilee celebrations, world tours ... then we'll hafta hand it to the radtrads: things are pretty bad in the Magic Kingdom

The diagnosis of the "guru" phenomenon is dead on, but a little harsh on the followers. The origins of it, like everything else in the post V2 Catholic crisis, came from a huge segment of the faithful getting cut adrift by the cultural revolutionaries bent on changing everything. There was precisely bupkis for these folks to cling to from circa 1967-1988.
Consider what was being served up by diocesan and parish religious ed. If you can stomach it.
They were told that everything they knew was wrong, outdated, or going to change, guided by that ever-adaptable Spirit of Vatican II: The Mass was a communal meal, and needed a whole lot of repairs; "scriptural scholars" revealed that Jesus didn't do or say a lot of what the Good Book said he did, and he sure didn't found a church, poor guy; the devotions had expired and were being suppressed, the sacraments had been misunderstood; when the Church spoke it was offering but one opinion among many, etc. One dizzying, badly-reasoned change followed another, year after year.
As a result, it was/is natural for the guru chasers to cling like a drowning swimmer to the first person who at least sounds like he or she finds something worthwhile in Catholicism. "The Mass is Jesus, presenting Himself on the altar;" "Here's the biblical basis for the necessity of Penance;" "I love the 2000 year tradition of the Church on its own terms," etc. Of course people are going to leap at it--a generation in the wilderness will do that to you! If the sheep aren't being fed, or are offered Wills & McBrien brand Dissenter Chow™, they'll look for someone--anyone--who will feed them, even where it may lack essential nutrients. At least the guru fans stayed in the Church. Uncounted thousands are Protestants, or late sleepers on Sunday.

Amy,
This is noteworthy w.r.t. youth groups such as Newman clubs on college campuses, "Theology on Tap", etc. The people you meet at these things are either "Catholic overdrive" or "church ladies" in training...
This is what you get when looking for "normal Catholics". Perhaps "normal Catholics" can't be picked out from "normal people" *because* they're innocuous!
Posted by: Ian | September 02, 2003 at 10:45 AM
3 Easters ago, I became Catholic, but I've always known Jesus was real. I was truly surprised to find that in the Catholic Church, the Body of Christ truly existed, both in the Eucharist and in the pews, in a way much more tangible than I had suspected.
I now find my heart often breaking over the issues identified and explored in this thread. I certainly did not realize a few years ago how fractured the Church was over such things. Having finally seen the light of Truth in the Church, it never occurred to me that there would be such battles within it. Naive? Of course.
Nevertheless, I long for the innocence about Catholicism that I had the first time the Body of Christ was placed in my hand, and, weeping, I said "Amen."
Posted by: Craig | September 02, 2003 at 10:52 AM
I fear that this string is falling into the same negativity that it criticizes others for. I'm not a member of any extra-parish lay group, but as long as they remain devoted to the Pope and the orthodox Catholic faith (as they certainly do), I see no harm. Gerard Serafin has it right: The beauty of the Catholic Church is that it allows multiple, different forms of spirituality to co-exist under one cohesive Faith, and if some people practice their faith by joining Opus Dei or supporting Mother Angelica's EWTN ministry, let it be. I'm sure St. Francis was doubted by some and accused of being a "guru," but thank God there was room in the Church for him to grow to holiness.
If you don't want to be a member of Opus Dei, fine, but then you'd better get involved with your parish or some other ministry or apostolate. Everyone needs to get back to the vineyard and serving Christ and stop worrying about what the other workers are doing. The Master could be returning, you know, any day.
Posted by: Cornelius | September 02, 2003 at 11:51 AM
Good post, Cornelius. The Body of Christ comprises millions of people each with a unique charism that should yield a special vocation. Too many folks worry about the shortcomings of others -- me too. Is Opus Dei perfect? Hardly. Is it, on balance, one version of a healthy and encouraging expression of our faith. Sure. Similarly, ETWN may not be everybody's glass of bourbon -- it's not mine -- but my mom loves it. I have no problem with that.

Rod, you wrote, "I find stories about how a particular movement has come into parishes and tried to take them over to be chilling in the implicit gnosticism present (you know, we're the *real* Catholics)."
But don't you see the irony here? You fear that Rome has abandoned the parish. And yet a new movement that exists only in parishes -- to the point of closing in a parish if the pastor doesn't support it -- is "chilling in [its] implicit gnosticism." (I presume you're talking about the Neocatechumenal Way).
The parish is collapsing because Christian faith has we have known it is collapsing. Read John Allen's Word from Rome column shortly after the Holy Father went to Spain -- practically the only people who still go to Church in Spain are involved in the "movements." The same is increasingly true of Italy. But some of these movements are parish based. I honestly think they're the future of the parish, not its nemesis.
Posted by: Rob | September 02, 2003 at 02:49 PM
Spain, Italy, France, Belgium, Austria ... parish life has collapsed in these traditional Catholic countries ... Why? How? Under whose watch?

Posted by: Charles A. | September 02, 2003 at 02:59 PM
I am in a parish in the Chicago area. I am on the parish council. In the Fall we are scheduled to have a series of parish-wide meetings. We are currently trying to decide the agenda for the meetings, but we have tentatively agreed that the issues to be discussed should focus locally on our parish, and not more widely on the Church at large. No doubt we will have some parishioners coming to the meetings to say that they are not fed by the parish experience, and others who will say that they are. Probably more the latter than the former, though it will be interesting to see.
As I have thought about all of this I have tried to think about parish experiences that all parishioners have in common. Though it seems painfully obvious to me now, it took me some serious reflection to conclude that the Liturgy (both Sunday Liturgy and during the week) is the center of the parish--and should have a prominent place in the discussion at the meetings. If the parish is a circle, then the Liturgy is at the center of the circle. If it isn't, then the parish is just a neighborhood.
It makes sense to me that renewal in the parish must begin with renewal in the Liturgy. That's why I am so heartened by the Vatican's focus on the Liturgy. The seeds sown today by this focus will take time to blossom, but with God's help they will blossom someday (who knows when, really) and parish life will have a new stronger center.
I can't believe that the Vatican doesn't have it in mind to regenerate parish life through the Liturgy. The idea of Rome "writing off" parishes as building blocks of the Church doesn't ring true to me.
Posted by: Mike Benz | September 02, 2003 at 03:49 PM
James, the parish is community on the geographic model; there are other ways to have community. Indeed, cloistered nuns don't belong to *parishes,* but rather to communities with a description primarily not geographic (ie. they're nuns in a community NOT ONLY because they live in the same building but because they share a charism and the Faith).
The difficulty of parish life is really the change in social structure. Our social structures are different; our communities will be different. It's a big change from an old model.
Added to that, we have this outrageous dissent going on in some parishes and many people need (not desire, but NEED) to drive across town to find another parish. There is no point in belonging to a parish at all if that parish worships some she-god with no doctrine, or worships itself. =) I laugh because of the stupidity of it, but it's not really funny--this junk happens and it happens often.
People have to go looking for the Faith now most of the time. It's hard enough without making them be pagans, protestants, narcissists, etc. etc.
Posted by: kazoo | September 02, 2003 at 05:30 PM
James, people are leaving their parishes because they want to hear the Gospel, not some sociological nonsense about tables, hugging and symbols or just nonsense. Personally, I didn't attend my local parish for years simply because once you've heard one tiny little woodland animal story you've heard em all. Every Mass a kids' Mass. Hey, it's easy and avoids controversy, right? That went on for almost 10 YEARS. I still drive to another parish.
People leave their parishes to lessen the amount of screeching racket they have to endure from the liturgy *experts*. People leave their parishes for a lot of reasons, and some of them very good ones.
People listen to Scott Hahn, Fr. Trigilio, Fr. Corapi, Fr. Groeschel and Mother Angelica because often their priests and religious ed directors are full of self-serving bosh, progressive distortion or too often flat-out lies and people get sick of it. People listen to these teachers because their priests either can't teach or don't know the Faith sometimes. People listen to these teachers because they really do want to know their Faith. Is that bad? At some point, about the time they tune into EWTN, they really do want to know something about their faith. Is this bad?
I don't think it's bad. I'm a convert and I was told the most astonishingly loose and bland stuff in RCIA, but I knew that there was more to the Faith than that. I do listen to EWTN and I am much richer for it.
Posted by: kazoo | September 02, 2003 at 05:50 PM
And James, when the parish is all you have left, then you will be a protestant by definition--a congregationalist.
Posted by: kazoo | September 02, 2003 at 05:51 PM
I suppose 'normal' is in the eyes of the beholder. What is a 'normal' Catholic anyway? We each probably have our own picture of what that person is like.
In my previous parish, 'normal' was a family of 6 that sent their kids to the parish school, volunteered for PTA and the festival, and went to the same Mass (almost) every weekend.
In my current parish, the 'normal' person doesn't have children in school, is active in social justice work, and is very active in the Liturgy.
Maybe when we long for more 'normal' Catholics to be around, we are really longing for a sense of connectedness and family that we once had, that a parish once provided.
We Catholics - like it or not - are a diverse group of people. I would propose this is a good thing - it's a sign of collective spiritual growth. And in this diversity there is also unity in our common call to Christ and the Church.
Posted by: Steve Bogner | September 02, 2003 at 06:08 PM
Gerard, yes, the Church has always contained movements and charisms. The Church has also always worked hard to keep them working in cooperation with each other and keep them orthodox. But they have always been important to the Church. For an example, I remember the whole story about St. Francis and the papal approval for his first rule. Do you recall the story and why it was almost not given?
With that goes the story of the birth of the Franciscan order in the vision at San Damiano. "Francis, rebuild my church" said the vision of Christ on the Cross to Francis. And through St. Francis, the horrible abuses (much like ours today, homosexual abuses, etc.) of the 11th/12th centuries were finally diminished because of the devotion and obedience of the people who followed him.
The newer movements (and orthodox sectors of older movements like some religious orders and 3rd orders) are behind much of the support and protection that seminarians are receiving now. They are behind much of the best Catholic education that people, including children, college students and converts, are receiving now. They make it more difficult for dissident bullies to get their way and that makes dissidents angry. These new movements are quietly building a new infrastructure and that also makes dissidents angry when they realize that the Faith is not rich buildings and mans' power, but God's work and it will go on.
Posted by: kazoo | September 02, 2003 at 06:25 PM
So what is a "parish" anyway?
In my diocese, you don't have to attend or register at the parish in which you live. I understand the historic concept of a parish as the geographic area where one lives, but my first parish after converting drew 85% of its active membership from outside the parish boundaries. I was part of that 85% because my local priest was crazy as a bed bug. Currently, I'm not sure of the parish in which I live, but there are three possibilities: one might as well be Episcopalian: white middle-class, gay friendly, and nice liturgy. The other two present cultural challenges, i.e., I don't speak Spanish. As a result, I alternate between a parish where I like the pastor and another parish set up for ex-Anglicans. In neither parish am I active beyond Sunday Mass.
Obviously, I am not casting stones in any direction: my own house has too much glass. Besides, it isn't like my friends and activities are in the neighborhood where I live, anyway. I have a car and I'm not afraid to use it.
But it's a legitimate question in my mind as to what a parish is when it isn't a geographic entity.

Maybe we can be a community of two? I'm not cut out for the movements either. They leave me wanting to run in the opposite direction, and the more I read about them the faster I want to run.?
More to the point, what kind of spirit divides what Christ has united? Parishes did not used to be like this. The history of the Pentecostal Movement is a trail of broken congregations. It's no different in the Catholic Church.

Educational Theater: Rethinking "Educational"
In this 5-minute Ignite-style talk at iKids, Barbara Chamberlin shared her views on how we - as developers of children's media - can do more... by tackling the hard stuff in avoiding "Educational Theater."
Game-Based Learning: Trends, Research and Sheer Ridiculousness
Barbara Chamberlin spoke about the current status of research and trends in game-based learning, at the Association for the Advancement of Computing in Education (AACE) 2015 conference of the Society for Information Technology and Teacher Education (SITE).
Kids Media Development: What are we EVEN doing?
Barbara Chamberlin spoke at the Dust or Magic Design Institute in 2014 on "educational theater" and ways we – as developers of educational tools – can avoid creating resources that simply look educational but miss the more crucial issues.
Successful Strategies for User Testing
Columbia 3.0 is a week-long digital event for media professionals to promote skill in video, animation, mobile, games, and transmedia for Latin America. Barbara Chamberlin (with NMSU's Learning Games Lab) spoke twice: once about user testing in our games lab, and then the capstone address — designed to inspire game makers about the roles our games can have.
How Can Games Change the World?
Trying Very Hard to Make Games that Don't Stink
Barbara Chamberlin, with the NMSU Learning Games Lab, shares their user testing processes and strategies. The educational development studio involves content experts and game developers in their game design process, also employing a rigorous user testing process throughout development. The Games Lab developers host learners in their target audience for 2-week sessions during the summer, and on holidays throughout the school year. They train their "game lab consultants" in giving feedback, and have access for frequent testing. Barbara shares the underlying principles that guides their user testing, with recommendations on how they could be amended by others for testing, even in shorter sessions.

Making is chaotic, progressive, repetitive, inevitable and essential in the process of creating any thing.
The definitive thing materialises from logically disorderly beginnings. Making beauty isn't typically beautiful. I’m hard pressed to think of any thing coming into being without firstly having to ramble across a few complex terrains, scramble over a few molehills... pins and needles.
Making our way along the same paths, over and over, again and again, makes each undertaking a little more familiar, more knowable. Though not less demanding.
And it’s comforting that within this pace and pattern, whilst we're immersed in the snip snip stroke of scissors and the beat beat stitch of the sewing machine, we discover space within the whirring and find small moments to adjust, tweak and improve.
It’s really only in thinking about this that I realise it is what happens.
It was watching the documentary Jiro Dreams of Sushi that made me think of our own making process.
“I do the same thing over and over, improving bit by bit,” says 85 year old Jiro Ono, sushi shokunin (artisan) who has been practicing his craft for more than 60 years.
Daunting... yet strangely comforting.
Early days for us yet. Back to the stitching hearth.

Just like adding a scorer doesn't magically raise team scoring. This is just childish simple mindedness.

I really don't see how Jagr HASN'T greatly affected the team's performance though when he's leading the team in scoring by a mile and we've had a ton of close, low-scoring games. Especially since he's managed to coax offensive contributions out of guys like Zajac, Ruutu and even Zubrus for a while.

Expectant parents Shakira and soccer star Gerard Pique of FC Barcelona have reportedly released a number of photos, part of the launching of a UNICEF-hosted web site that invites fans to attend a virtual baby shower. Instead of sending the couple baby gifts, the site requests fans buy gifts costing as little as $5 that will lead to a better world. The gifts, which range in price, are part of a program to to donate the proceeds towards purchasing items that will benefit children around the world. According to the site, the shower will donate all proceeds, allowing UNICEF to purchase polio vaccines, malaria drugs, and even food for malnourished children. Guests can spend $10 for polio vaccines to protect 17 children, or $37 for a baby scale, site organizers announced in a posting Wednesday.
“To celebrate the arrival of our first child, we hope that, in his name, other less privileged children in the world can have their basic needs covered through gifts and donations,” read a posting on the organization's site. “Thank you for sharing this unforgettable moment with us.”
The images are the latest released by Shakira. The Latin America star has posted a number of photos through various social media, including Twitter and Facebook. The 35-year-old Colombian pop star, who is a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador, has already made it clear that they expect to continue to make a difference even as they begin to build a family.
While the couple have yet to release the due date for the child, the latest photo shows Shakira is close to giving birth. The couple have already announced that they are expecting a boy.
For Sharkira, the latest charity program is simply another step towards giving back. The singer has repeatedly made clear that children and education are and have always been a priority. She has already founded "Pies Descalzos," an organization that builds and funds schools around her home country of Colombia. The artist has also used her celebrity status in the past to meet with elected officials and leaders, including President Barack Obama, and advocate for Latino children in the United States, especially for those who are part of undocumented families.

The Spirit Level proved what egalitarians had always known
It was the book that finally proved what egalitarian-minded liberals knew all along – that inequality was not only morally wrong but was literally the leading cause of all social ills, from homicide to obesity to early death and divorce.
The more equal a country was, claimed Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett in The Spirit Level, the better everyone, both rich and poor, performed in every measure of social development. It must have been true – because they had graphs and statistics to prove it.
Roy Hattersley said: “It demonstrates the scientific truth of the assertion that social democrats have made for a hundred years.” Yasmin Alibhai-Brown gushed in the Independent that: “All free marketeers should be made to memorise it from cover to cover.”
The theory has just one tiny flaw – it’s complete rubbish. According to Natalie Evans in the Guardian:.
They’re not the only ones. Last week, having read The Spirit Level “from cover to cover”, I then read Christopher Snowdon’s The Spirit Level Delusion: Fact-checking the Left’s New Theory of Everything.
Snowdon goes through the methodology involved in The Spirit Level and picks so many holes in the theory that were it a building it wouldn’t be passed as structurally sound by the most crooked of third world local government surveyors. Snowdon should get a job de-programming Independent readers.
The Spirit Level takes its methods from Ronald Fisher, the father of modern statistics. Fisher was a botanist who would grow two groups of tomato plants in near-identical conditions but with subtle differences, then compare the rate of growth. But The Spirit Level compares vastly different cultures, such as those of Scandinavia, formerly Communist eastern Europe, the United States and Japan, and attributes all sorts of differences to inequality.
There are other problems. The Spirit Level’s life expectancy graph uses obsolete data. Their facts about mental illness are carefully selected and based on surveys which have been widely criticised by psychiatrists. They exclude countries which don’t fit the pattern. And there is no link between homicide and inequality, Britain having lower levels than Sweden and Finland and the US being an outlier (in fact in the US crime rates entirely correlate to the size of the African-American population, something Wilkinson and Pickett only briefly and awkwardly touch on). In terms of divorce, crime, alcohol consumption, smoking, single-parent households and suicide, the more equal societies actually do worse.
As Snowdon writes: “Neither random nor controlled, ecological studies (i.e. comparing whole nations) allow unlimited scope for interpretation.”
This is known as the “ecological fallacy”, and its most famous examples are the “link” between Protestant countries and suicide or that between fatty diets and breast cancer. Both mix up correlation and causation, and both are rubbish. In fact, as Snowdon shows, one could easily take the Spirit Level’s statistics to “prove” that recycling “causes” suicide.
As Snowdon writes:  per cent of the country.”
But the proponents of the spirit level fallacy are indeed blinkered, and motivated by an ideological agenda devoted towards equality of outcomes. Almost twenty years after the fall of the Soviet Union, the social philosophy of egalitarianism, which seeks to remove all inequalities in society, not just inequalities of opportunity, is stronger than ever. The Spirit Level is just one of many recent anti-consumerist tracts – Affluenza by Oliver James, MG Marmot’s Status Syndrome and Richard Layard’s Happiness – which advocate higher taxes, bigger government and fresh prohibitions.
All these books are dressed up in pop psychology and packaged towards educated 20-somethings who are outraged by the gross inequalities in societies and spiritually alienated by consumerism. But, beneath the gloss, the ideas proposed in many of these books – not the least in The Spirit Level – are deeply sinister, and would require massive assaults on personal freedom in the name of an unachievable goal. Wilkinson and Pickett fondly reminisce about the lower inequality levels of wartime Britain without elaborating on the fact that this country became a police state during that period out of sheer necessity. Of course we felt equal – we were facing slavery or death together!
Next time someone starts spouting off about “equality” – a goal that has dug more graves than all the gods in history combined – send them a copy of Snowdon’s excellent book and make sure they read it from cover toProduct Information

By Ginny Engholm

So tired of sanctimonious mommies."Older screen door closer mechanisms consisted of a simple spring. Once the door was opened, the spring forcefully closed the door when it was released. The successor to the spring is called a pneumatic opener/closer, which is essentially a shock absorber for the door. After opening, it slowly pulls the door back into the closed position. If the mechanism is not adjusted correctly, however, the door will either slam shut or will not close at all.
1
Open the screen door fully. This will charge the hydraulic cylinder of the door closer mechanism.
2
Locate the screw on the end of the cylinder. This is the adjustment screw. Turn this screw one half-turn clockwise. Release the door and observe the results.
3
Turn the screw one-quarter turn counterclockwise if the screen door does not fully close after the first adjustment. Open the door fully and allow it to close. Make adjustments so that the door closes tightly but does not slam. Turning the screw clockwise will slow the rate of screen door travel, while turning the screw counterclockwise will increase the speed of the door. Trial and error when turning the screw each way will eventually give you the correct balance so that the door closes quickly and quietly without slamming shut.
Things You Will Need
- Screwdriver
Tip
- If you need the screen door to remain open for an extended amount of time, for things like moving objects through the doorway, turn the adjustment screw all the way in. This will freeze the cylinder in place, and the door will not close once opened.Logo design contest

"Few crimes are more shocking than the sex trafficking of minor children," said Roberto Escobar-Vargas, special agent in charge of ICE HSI in Puerto Rico, "Together with our federal, state and local partners, ICE HSI is committed to protecting those who cannot protect themselves."
According to the information, Cintron-Pons conducted a business through Latin Star restaurant and nightclub, which promoted the online services through, by entering the key phrase "masajes eroticos" (erotic massages).
On July 8, Cintron-Pons met with the informant and confirmed that he had five 15-year-old female minors available for "services" to be provided to the clients. On July 12, Cintron-Pons met with the informant and agents and headed to the residence where the females would meet the clients and where Cintron-Pons would get paid. The agents arrived at the residence in Rio Grande and upon his arrival, Cintron-Pons was arrested and the females were interviewed. Three of the females indicated that they were under the age of 18.

Yahoo's public records search says that it allows you to "search thousands of public databases with one click! Find addresses, property, licenses, court records and more." If you enter a name and address, it returns a list of names that match, including ages.
These results aren't from Yahoo itself, but rather from its partner, USSearch.com, a public records search company. While being able to find out how old your neighbors are is amusing, you can, for a fee, get much more detailed information about anyone in the vast databases USSearch.com taps into.
Try searching on your own name (scroll down to the public records search form, with the bluish background). If you find a link to what appears to be information about you, the company offers six services that provide more information.
A "basic people search" costs $9.95, and returns a full reported name (first and last, middle name or initial, and phone numbers (if available). USSearch.com says that they search over 200,000,000 records instantly to provide this information.
For $39.95, you get an "advanced people search." This includes everything from the basic report, a full history of where you've lived over the years, possible aliases, and a deceased search.
$59.95 gets you an "expert assisted people search" where a "location specialist ensures you get the best possible results." The report includes everything in the advanced search results, plus relatives, roommates and neighbors, bankruptcies, tax liens, small claims civil judgments, marriage and divorces, and real property ownership and value.
Want more? Just $99.95 gets you an "expert assisted background search" with everything above, plus an on-premise county criminal search, which includes case number, charge offense, arrest file, disposition date, disposition & sentence, and free local and national media web-based search including over 675 sources.
Sound creepy? As personal as it seems, almost all of this information is contained in public records. USSearch.com does not maintain the databases it searches. Instead, it accesses separately maintained third party databases to collect information for the reports they provide.
According to the company's privacy policy, you can request to opt out of reports containing non-public record information (sources like information compiled from magazine subscriptions) that is available for sale to the general public. But the company "cannot provide any assurance that information that is otherwise public record information, such as court records, will be withheld."
As time goes on, more and more public records are going online, and firms like USSearch.com, via major destination sites like Yahoo, are making it easier than ever for literally anyone with a credit card to access this information. While this can be a good thing (think: doing a background check before hiring a nanny for your children), it also has the result of exposing what you might consider very personal information to the prying eyes of anyone who cares to snoop about you.

Researcher Donald Glut's ambitious, first Dinosaur Dictionary (1972) was just a step behind the times. It may have had nearly all the species known to date but was seriously lacking in the art department. There just wasn't enough new artists on the scene yet. It was just three years premature of the start of the most significant era in paleontology.
What was happening was nothing short of a 'Dinosaur Renaissance' (or modernist consensus). Peter Dodson was researching sexual dimorphism and Robert Bakker, a Yale undergrad, had done enough research to prove that dinosaurs were not slow, stupid, solitary or evolutionary failures. In fact they may not have all died out. Some may have evolved into birds. In other words: what we thought we knew about dinosaurs was wrong. Very wrong! No more draggin' tails...
Adrian Desmond's 'The Hot Blooded Dinosaurs' heralded the theories in a popular book whose
very title was to become a television dinosaur documentary produced by Horizon/NOVA. Bakker appeared here first and within a few years would be seen in practically every new program being made on the subject. His collective knowledge would take at least a decade to materialize in a book but would be long awaited and another paleontological milestone. In the meantime, Ostrom and Bakker made a case in his "Dinosaur Renaissance" article in April 1975's Scientific American.
For her illustration in that article, Sarah Landry gets credit for the first dinosaur (Syntarsus) with feathers. Shortly after, Gregory Paul entered the field as both paleontologist and artist. After years of dun, browns, gray, greens and tans, Paul and another artist named Ely Kish, decided dinosaurs probably had bolder colors and spots and stripe patterns like some modern animals.
There was a revolution going on but most kids wouldn't have even known it. The dinosaur image was officially changed. However, you would not have guessed by looking at most 1970s popular books and shows, like 'Hanna Barbara's Valley of the Dinosaurs'. Wah Chang's educational reel 'Dinosaurs: the Terrible Lizards' and 'Land of the Lost' featured stop motion models. Marx playsets and assorted Hong Kong rubber figures continued to fill toy stores and model kits by Aurora and Airfix all seem derived from Ray Harryhausen's cinematic monsters. In Europe, plastic figures by Starlux were patterned over 40-50 year old paintings by Burian and Knight. There was nothing up-to-date about the first museum lines from Invicta Plastics (for the British Museum of Natural History). Only the Royal Ontario Museum line in the late 1970s bothered to include a lambeosaurus with its tail above ground as the changing image indicated. Besides, preserved dinosaur track ways seldom were found with tail marks.
By the end of the decade, 'dinosaur courses' were actually in the curriculum at Stockton State College in New Jersey and University of California at Berkley. John Horner had discovered nesting grounds in Montana, proving at last that at least some dinosaurs were intelligent, maternal and social animals, traits ensuring longevity. In a pre-internet world, the latest theories were being exchanged at the first of what would be annual meetings for the Society of Vertebrate Paleontologists.
Robert T. Bakker
In the late 1960s, paleontologist Robert T. Bakker drew what could be considered the first modern restoration, a running Deinonychus (1969). Bakker's theories completely changed the image of the dinosaur as sluggish, solitary and stupid cold-blooded reptiles to active, social and smart warm-blooded animals linked directly to birds. Bakker's own illustrations, always in pencil or ink, continued to be innovative in terms of behavior and unsurpassed in anatomical accuracy. Indeed he is responsible for the first skeletal profile (Triceratops) and leopard spotted theropods which inspired artist Gregory Paul, who studied under Bakker at Johns Hopkins University. Reflecting Bakker's new image were a galloping Chasmosaurus, (1971), rearing up Brontosaurus, and quarreling Leptoceratops. Throughout the 1970s-80s, Bakker drew well over three hundred species and scenes, most published in his own The Dinosaur Heresies in 1986. These illustrations lack the accuracy and detail found in Bakker's 1970s work, intentionally done at times as cartoonish and whimsical. Extra effort went to present dinosaurs with all their feet off the ground instead of static poses, to the point where some look like they're practically in flight! (Psittacosaurus, Montanoceratops).
Eleanor M. Kish
In 1975, under the direction of paleontologist Dale A. Russell, Eleanor (Ely) M. Kish was hired at the age of 50 to produce an atmospheric series of paintings for the Canadian Museum of Nature that were more accurate than any before (excepting a Triceratops with sprawling forelimbs, a Saurolophus resembling something out of the 'Star Wars' cantina and a swamp-bound Edmontosaurus / corythosaurs.) Almost an overreaction to the tubby old school image of the dinosaur, even her healthy dinosaurs appear nearly anorexic but never hyperactive. Among the first artists to beautifully restore the proper paleoflora, particularly of the Cretaceous Period of western Canada, her color choices were still fairly conservative; Kish's gets the credit for first painted dinosaur camouflaged to its environment (a Hypacrosaurus). She continued the proper tail-above-ground reconstructions and, like Charles Knight before her, created plaster models before beginning a piece to see which angles were most dynamic for her extinct subjects and where shadows fell to achieve utmost realism. She is the first to restore an extinction scenario (seen below). Kish can be credited as the pioneer of photorealistic paleoart and most of her work can be seen in the book A Vanished World by Dale Russell. Like so many veteran artists, her 1990s paintings' landscapes remained dense and lurid but the dinosaurs started to look uncharacteristically cartoonish (any of the Tiny Perfect Dinosaur books, see example on the right).
Gregory S. Paul
Before composing a painting or drawing, Gregory S. Paul (the only paleontologist besides Bakker in this movement), meticulously constructed skeletal profiles based off original research. The first (and for a long time only) modern paleoartist to title pieces down to their exact species. Some thirty years later Paul's skeletons are still being revised and used by artists and scientists alike everywhere. Working closely under Bakker in the 1970s, Paul's early charging Triceratops was directly patterned after Bakker's Chasmosaurus. Early Paul restorations were conservatively detailed or cautiously restored (i.e. forward facing if the lateral details weren't described, his early drawings of Oviraptor hid the tail until it was recovered). Small predatory dinosaurs and young theropods were given downy feathers even in the late 1970s (Stenonychosaurus, Deinonychus), which were speculative then but ended up being confirmed 20 years later. No one else was doing it (this includes any of the 1980s names). Innovative behaviors never before rendered: pack hunting (allosaurs, Coelophysis), herding/nesting/parenting (Kritosaurus, Maiasaura), galloping (Pentaceratops), flocking (the usually solitary Archaeopteryx, pterosaurs), rearing up on hindlimbs (Chasmosaurus), swimming (Dilophosaurus, iguanodonts) and even just resting or scratching an itch (Allosaurus). Choice of color ranged from yellows (ceratopsids) to the standard drab greys (sauropods). His dinosaurs were given convergent evolutionary patterns found in extant animals, from leopard spots (Allosaurus, Albertosaurus) and tiger striping (Yangchuanosaurus) to false eye, peacock patterns on ceratopsian shields (Pentaceratops herd) and eyestripes (Hypacrosaurus, Parasaurolophus among redwoods).
Unlike his contemporaries', Paul's work is subject to constant revision as new evidence emerges (i.e. adding spines to backs of sauropods), Paul's restorations always end up accurate even by today's standards. His landscapes are generally sparse because paleobotanical data was (and is) generally still not reliable enough. Waterbirds are present in many of his scenes, sometimes peacefully perched atop a sauropod or ceratopsid. When the asteroid/extinction theory arose, Paul was the only paleoartist to resist the temptation of illustrating a theoretical dinosaur apocalypse scene. He also never released inaccurate panoplies, Imitated constantly through the years (his brachiosaur was ripped off by Harry Pincus in Glut, 1980), Dave Marrs (in PaleoWorld TV series), and even Raul Martin (in Barrett, 2001). Without being known for ultrarealism or atmosphere, Paul's the leader in the dino art movement, such as making it cool to actually show a predator just resting and not showing its teeth. Other than Robert Bakker, no modern paleoartists have authored and illustrated any major or academic dino books; Bakker's done just one but Paul has done four.
William Stout
Comic book/fantasy artist William Stout's watercolor dinosaurs are described by most experts as romanticized or fanciful portrayals, and illustrate the danger of paleoart from professional artists who are not professional scientists. Author Donald Glut filled his New Dinosaur Dictionary (1982) with many of Stout's pieces, which drew some criticism from paleontologists. Glut did not rely on Stout's work for his Dinosaurs: The Encyclopedia (1997) due to the glut of available artists. Early works show a Charles Knight influence, disregarding long-disproven mistakes. To some, Stout's own book The Dinosaurs: A Fantastic View of Lost Era (1981) showed off the new image of dinosaurs as vivacious, real animals. To others, it's a collection of pure fantasy: Stone Age landscapes (cave dwelling Leptoceratops, Camptosaurus behind an enormous boulder), inaccurate proportions or characteristics (a horned Tarbosaurus) and scale and pterosaurs in the sky just to fill the space even if they didn't exist in the time or locale. More interested in instilling dinosaurs with character, Stout's heads are often given too-expressive mammalian eyes, emaciated with sunken orbits, overly skeletal rib cages (Dromaeosaurus), etc. Completely unfounded behaviors (snake constricting a dinosaur, Dromiceiomimus chasing a butterfly, Alioramus devouring a medium-sized dinosaur whole, etc.) Stout can be credited with the first drawings of diseased dinosaurs (Triceratops), mating dinosaurs (Parasaurolophus) and defecating dinosaurs (Riojasaurus).
Stout incorporated more accuracy and improved his technique tremendously in the 2000s but he sure channels Knight with The San Diego Natural History Museum murals are the best mammal murals since Matternes, nothing short of phenomeonal.
HONORABLE MENTIONS:
John C. McLoughlin
John C. McLoughlin was an American zoologist whose popular books Archosauria and Synapsida were also filled with his own landscape-less, ink stipple dot / cross-stitch pattern drawings. He was the illustrator of Ratkevich's Dinosaurs of the Southwest. The only artist to confidently declare all other ceratopsian restorations are inaccurate because their shields attached to their backs as one big muscular mass. His bizarre anatomical interpretations didn't end there: T rex had eagle eyes due to a ridge directly over its eye, Iguanodon's thumb spikes were "spines", Even Teratosaurus made his book as a "Triassic coelurosaur". McLoughlin never got to defend any of these statements because none of the real paleontologists actually took them seriously. Still, his dinosaurs looked modern enough at a time when popular books had not witnessed the Dinosaur Revolution, and still were copying outdated works by Knight and Burian.
Richard Rush Studio
Sculptors Richard Rush gets a nod for his 1976 Tyrannosaurus rex (supervision by Princeton's Donald Baird) and the studio's Dilophosaurus, supervised by Gregory Paul. The rex was the first to be walking horizontally, tail above ground, head down. Its head details were most accurate for the time. The studio did a few other prehistoric animals but these two dinosaurs are their highest achievements.
Peter Zallinger
Two to three decades after his father Rudolph's Yale mural, son Peter Zallinger was carrying on the family name with the dinosaur art tradition. With similar technique and coloring choices it was clear Peter was influenced by his father and also followed in illustrating children's books and the world's first multimedia kit (under John Ostrom's supervision) in the 1970s. Reflecting the new research, Peter's dinosaurs were steps in the right direction keeping their tails in the air most of the time...Honorees of 18b Arts District Day. PHOTO BY HEW BURNEY
Unsure what 18b means? First of all, tsk tsk… It’s the official name of the Downtown Las Vegas Arts District, of course! (It refers to the 18 blocks that comprise the district.) And second, you might not be alone in not knowing that.
But the current leadership of 18b is intent on solving that problem, and their next step in that direction comes at 6:30 PM on Tuesday, December 10 at the Amanda Harris Gallery of Contemporary Art. Called 18×18, it’s the first in a new speaker series meant to showcase the creative talent in and around the Arts District.
The event picks up where Mayor Carolyn Goodman left off on April 18 of this year, which she proclaimed 18b Arts District Day, says Marc Abelman, president of 18b and co-owner of Insidestyle.
“The board got together and thought we needed to do something for the community,” Abelman says. “Part of our mission is to serve as a community connector. You can only do so much through social media, and as we grow, I believe we’ll need a space, a venue for people to come and talk about things.”
He added that, in the past, 18b meetings have mainly taken place in reaction to hot topics—such as last summer’s proposal by the City to rename Art Way after arts patron Joyce Straus. (The effort failed.) Going forward, Abelman says, he’d like the 18b community to gather regularly and discuss current events before they become contentious issues.
Next week’s 18×18 is meant to set the stage for such ongoing dialog. Modeled on the PechaKucha 20×20 events, 18×18 will feature several pioneers of the Arts District. Each one will present 18 slides and talk about them for 18 seconds per slide.
Organizer Kirsten Clarke, a volunteer for 18b, says that the presentations of 18×18 will include introductions and conclusions, and there will be an audience Q&A at the end. After that, the gathering will adjourn to Lady Silvia, where attendees can enjoy the bar’s signature 18b cocktail at the happy hour price of $6 for the entire evening.
Clarke notes there will be no food served at the event, and recommends stopping by one of the nearby eateries before heading to Amanda Harris.
“The event is meant to offer a relaxed atmosphere and an opportunity to gather with the community,” she says.
Tickets to 18×18 are free and can be reserved here.Monday’s notice about Bellevue’s open house for the future NE 15/16th Street arterial in the Bel-Red corridor didn’t go unnoticed by Bellevue planners, who’ve asked me to clarify the design options on the table for the arterial. I’ve been a bit mouthy about one of the options, a 177-foot wide cross-section along NE 16th where Link would run along the center of the arterial in what is referred to as Zone 4 (PDF). According to Rick Logwood of the Bellevue DOT, that option is no longer being considered, after recent council discussions. Instead, a much narrower street is being considered, and one that I think is much more successfully scaled to pedestrians (see above).
Logwood also says that outside of the segment with center-running light rail, the cross-sections are much narrower since Link will run off the street to the north:
Elsewhere, the typical section is much narrower. The graphic shown has 177’ at the widest point in the entire corridor. Where we are today in discussion is more on the order of 128’ – that is a significant difference – and will change public opinion.
The two perspectives (Alternatives: A, B) that do not show the LRT station are located between 120th and 124th Avenues NE. As you can see the width is much less than what has been portrayed – where LRT is in fact in a different alignment. The third is where the station is located, but reflects where the Bellevue City Council discussed reducing the number of travel lanes east of 124th Avenue NE to one through lane in each direction.
The other urban district in the corridor where light rail runs off to the north is referred to as Zone 2 (PDF) (the Spring District)– NE 15th Street between 120th and 124th Aves NE. The two perspectives that Logwood mention show cross-sections with 4 travel lanes, 1 turn lane, and 1 parking lane. The only difference between the two options is the addition of a cycletrack in Alternative B.
As far as the design options in Zone 2 go, their conduciveness to walkability can be debated. Personally, I would like to see one travel lane in each direction for the entire corridor, but that wish usually never works out politically.
Thanks for posting such a clear and prominent correction, Sherwin. A certain news site around these parts (sweet and fizzy beverage, anyone?) could learn a thing or two from you guys.
Would link trains still be forced to go at the speed limit of the adjacent roadway in Bel-red? or could they go at 55mph?
Without crossing gates, it’ll have to be at the speed limit.
However, having done delivery work on both sides of the lake, I expect there’ll be MORE car/train collisions on the eastside than there have been along MLK, so they might end up adding them for safety reasons, which would allow the trains to go faster.
In Zone 2 Link will run in a retained cut north of NE 15th and stop in a below-grade station. I don’t know if trains will do the full 55 though, as they don’t even max out in the Beacon Hill tunnel.
Elevate it or it put it underground! There isn’t even an existing neighborhood to disturb here… We only get one shot at this—let’s not mess up again by choosing surface.
There’s no reason to bridge the ravine and connect 116th with a new major east/west arterial. All access well past the forseeable future can be served more than adaquately with improvements to 120th, 124th and 130th and their intersections at Northup and Bel-Red.
I’ve been defending the wider option, but I have to admit, this does look a hell of a lot better.
In my opinion the proportions are much better.
The open house was quite good. The renderings and maps portray a very different approach than what council and the transportation commit was reviewing even 6 months ago. I think the message is getting through :-)
The new “15/16th” won’t connect with 116th. It takes a turn to the south and connects with 112th (aka Bel-Red Road). This intersection I think will cause more grief than help. Perhaps a westbound exit only with ped/bike access would make sense.
Part of the “problem” east of the spring district is a fire code that requires 20′ roadway on each side (north and south) of the train tracks. A change in the development pattern would be required (or change in the fire code) to do much better than what’s propose.
There was a lot of design work pointing to the creek drainages. I think this might be a response to the complete focus on pavement I’ve seen up until now. Next step, get the design money allocated to parks from transportation so that the green we see on the renderings actually is funded to the same level as the asphalt.
Well it’s good to know that the public is with us on this.-

Described by Ben & Jerry’s as “the sweet taste of liberty in your mouth,” Americone Dream consists of vanilla ice cream with fudge-covered waffle cone pieces and caramel.
From the AP report:
The Vermont-based ice-cream maker is known for naming its flavors after people such as Jerry Garcia, Wavy Gravy and the band Phish which Colbert sees as a political bias.
“I’m not afraid to say it. Dessert has a well-known liberal agenda,” Colbert said in a statement. “What I hope to do with this ice cream is bring some balance back to the freezer case.”

The Liturgy of Saint James is considered to be the oldest surviving liturgy developed for general use in the Church. Its date of composition is still disputed with some authorities proposing an early date, perhaps ca. AD 60, close to the time of composition of Saint Paul's Epistle to the Romans, while.,[2] arrangement of the English verses of the Cherubic hymn of the Offertory chant (see above) to the melody of a French folk tune Picardy. The hymn is also popular in the Roman Catholic Latin rite as an alternative to the spoken communion antiphon.

About the program
The program combines resources for individuals working in research and teaching laboratories. It addresses injury prevention, emergency preparedness, chemical safety, laboratory equipment safety information and links to other laboratory safety programs.
Chemical Safety
Common chemicals and their hazards
Chemicals in the laboratory are hazardous and understanding the hazard(s) associated with a specific chemical will provide the user the knowledge to use the chemical appropriately. Safety Data Sheets (SDS) are often the first place to obtain hazard information on a chemical. For more infromation, refer to the Chemical Laboratory Information Profiles (CLIPs) published by the American Chemical Society for identifying the hazards of common chemicals in the laboratory. Hydrogen Fluoride (HF) Exposure Information and Tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) publications are also available for your reference.
Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
Before using Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) a hazard assessment must be completed by the Supervisor / Principal Investigator (PI) using the Laboratory Hazard Assessment Tool (LHAT). Each lab memberl must view the hazard assessment, as well as review a short PPE training presentation. The lab member can then print a voucher that can be exchanged for PPE at the campus storehouse.
For more information, refer to the Personal Protective Equipment webpage.#133: Steelers Book Review
If you're a Steeler fan with a coffee table, there's one conversation piece it shouldn't be without.
"Pittsburgh Steelers: The Complete Illustrated History" is accurately billed as a "comprehensive history of the NFL's most successful team."
This 192-page tome contains 200 photos and organizes the information by decade.
The first four chapters outline the franchise's lean years, and is especially informative to the fans who are aged 40 or younger who don't remember the days when the Steelers weren't one of the premiere franchises in professional sports.
Lew Freedman, the author (and longtime sports journalist), did his homework as he gives readers an inside look at the personalities who made their way through Pittsburgh, like Johnny "Blood" McNally (do you know where the nickname came from?), Byron "Whizzer" White (future Supreme Court Justice), "Bullet" Bill Dudley, and even guys without nicknames or even folks who never actually made the roster (Arthur Jarrett).
Some figures are given added attention, to the point where you feel like you have actually met them, like former quarterback Bobby Layne, defensive tackle Eugene "Big Daddy" Lipscomb, and of course, "The Chief" Art Rooney.
The book is littered with information, from bios on front office personnel that helped build the great 1970s Steeler dynasty (Bill Nunn, Jr), to anecdotal recollections (including one in which a famous singer enlisted in Franco's Italian Army).
There is also a bibliography and appendix at the end that includes team and player statistics through 2007.
The photographs are both well-chosen and well-laid out. The conglomeration of the prints and the prose do the difficult job of transporting the reader out of time.
Now to the nitty gritty (and somewhat picky).
It is evident that this book was rushed to press, perhaps to capitalize on Pittsburgh's Super Bowl XLIII triumph.
As a former college newspaper editor, typos jump off the page for me. For example, in the fifth paragraph of the introduction, the "L" is missing from the name "Blount". In the biographical sidebar for Bill Nunn, Jr, the word "took" is omitted when "Noll advantage of Nunn's" skills.
The largest gaffe I found in the collection was a graph that illustrates the team's year-by-year records. In the 2000s, it lists the 2004 record as 12-4 (instead of 15-1) and the 2008 record as 7-9 (quite low for a Super Bowl winner).
It appears that the publisher copied the graph from the end of the 1990s chapter, put in its place for the 2000s chapter, but neglected to change the actual records.
Overall, through, "Pittsburgh Steelers: The Complete Illustrated History" appears to be factually accurate and simultaneously tells the 76-year history of the team through the eyes of its players and its observers.
If you can deal with the occasional typographical error, this book is well worth the $30 retail price. Perhaps future printings will correct the mistakes mentioned above and tighten up the publication that much better.
"Pittsburgh Steelers: The Complete Illustrated History" is available in book stores, Sam's Club, or through Amazon.com (where it is nearly $12 less) and other online retailers.

The trope is about works that have a Captain Ersatz of a story, rather than a character. However, a lot of the examples are just "one very broad element shows up in one thing, as well as another!" There are just a lot of examples that seem like blatant overuse. There are serious reaches, like games that are considers S Ls for sharing a single element. It gets particularly bad when it comes to video games. I know it's YMMV, but things like Sleeping Dogs (GTA clone set in Hong Kong) being a SL for River City Ransom (beat 'em up with RPG elements set in a high school) merely because there's a "focus on close combat"? Additionally, there's an issue of games set in the same genre but with different settings that get shoehorned in as well. Okami and Beyond Good & Evil get called this for Zelda, despite the fact that based on the description they're actually the exact opposite of this trope, since they have the same gameplay but different stories. It needs some sort of clear description or criteria. Even for a YMMV it's very ill-defined.

Serial Numbers Filed Off needs to be almost exactly like the predecessor. It's also a negative attribute. This item is part of the expy superfamily of tropes. These always get wild misuse.

Can I just pull the same-genre examples? That's just plain misuse, right? And is it specifically about story reuse? The description is pretty plainly about that, but... yeah. The examples obviously aren't.

Seems like there are at least three tropes here: Serial Numbers Filed Off ("this is basically an adaptation/remake of an earlier work, but without having the license for it"), Done In The Style Of ("this is a lot like [Creator]'s work, but not done by them"), and Unofficial Shared Universe ("this comes off as a prequel/sequel to another work").
6 DonaldthePotholer11th Jun 2013 11:01:39 PM from Somewhere in (not)Miami
The way I read the Trope is: This work was [(originally/supposed to be part of)/inspired by] a (then-)extant franchise but we (lost/couldn't get) the license and turned it into an Original work. Serial Numbers Filed Off seems to be more: We're not even bothering to hide the copy/paste lines. EDIT: Perhaps the best way to fix this is to violate our Golden Standard, at least with respect to opinions. If an opinion can be cited, (even down to the level of "Several YouTube Users",) then it can be kept. Claims that are completely ambiguous should burn.

The problem is that we, as a population, just don't know what Mr. Entry Pimp "knows," and often don't have the time to verify it. Troper B could come up with a completely different comparison from what Troper A posted. What is to say that either opinion is invalid? Conversely, what's to say that either opinion is valid? This is why I say we need to limit examples to Word of God/St. Paul, BigNameFans, and expressed Vocal Minorities (The latter two form Word of Dante). Otherwise, we invite the type of misuse that the OP is referencing.

It seems like most of the problems are from the video game section.
I suspect that the Trope Decay is being caused by examples like this:
- It can also happen between games. Ōkami and Beyond Good & Evil have been called "the best The Legend of Zelda games of the year" at times.

The it-thingy
Histeria and Horrible Histories may be long gone, but really they live as a series called Axis Powers Hetalia. Though one couldn't help but wonder whether the overblown National Stereotypes in G Gundam might have been foreshadowing. Then again, considering just how absurd and insane said stereotypes were presented (such as Neo-Mexico's "Sombrero Gundam"), that anime makes even Hetalia at its most over the top look subtle.Which one of these is about Humongous Mecha rather than historical comedy?
As this mashup proves, calling Inception a Darker and Edgier Psychonauts reboot is surprisingly fitting....about the only thing these two have in common is a plot device.
Another one of David Lynch's works, Eraserhead, has its own Spiritual Licensee in the form of Yume Nikki. The similarities between the two are uncanny....you mean, they are both bizarre Mind Screws that feature Surreal Symbolic Heads?
(Prototype) is also often compared to The Thing (1982).I'm only familiar with the latter, but I'm lead to understand that they share a display of the same kinds of Paranoia Fuel and Body Horror and little else.

Looking over the various related tropes (Spiritual Licensee, Spiritual Successor, Serial Numbers Filed Off, etc), I think the main difference here is that Spiritual Successor is about the same type of media, while Spiritual Licensee is a different type of media. In other words, a better name for Spiritual Licensee might be Spiritual Adaptation. For example, say the original work is a video game. If, years later, a new video game very similar to the original was made, but not actually part of the same franchise, then that would be a Spiritual Successor. However, if a movie was made that had very similar premise/plot/setting/characters/etc, then that would be a Spiritual Licensee instead.
15 Larkmarn3rd Aug 2013 10:29:52 AM , Relationship Status: Hello, I love you
Also, Spiritual Successor has to be by the same people. But renaming to Spiritual Adaptation seems like a good idea, it'll help curb people going "AHA! THESE TWO GAMES SHARE ONE ELEMENT! I must add it!"

The description of it makes it pretty clear that it's by at least some of the same people.
18 NativeJovian3rd Aug 2013 11:30:10 AM from Orlando, Florida

A Spiritual Successor is not part of the original franchise, but "is nonetheless considered to be a successor because it's made by the same creators, shares common themes, styles, or elements; or, most likely, both". So you've got two different things there: "made by the same creators" and "shares common themes, styles, or elements". By the definition on the page, if either of those criteria are met, then it's a Spiritual Successor, but one usually includes the other. (Personally, I'd just take the second criteria — the page is full of examples of sharing themes/styles/elements but having different creators — but that's not what's actually written on the page.)
19 NativeJovian4th Aug 2013 02:54:37 PM from Orlando, Florida

Since the clock is running, let's try to actually keep this ball rolling. We've got a proposal to set Spiritual Successor as "work that has the same feel of an earlier work from a different franchise but the same media" and Spiritual Licensee as "work that has the same feel from and earlier work in a different media (actual, official licensed products excluded, obviously)". We have a separate, but related, proposal to rename Spiritual Licensee to Spiritual Adaptation. Thoughts? Comments? Should I just make a crowner?

"Same feel" is just too vague... I don't think it'll curb those people that see connections where none exist. Honestly, I don't know how we'd curb those people.

Electric vehicles running out of juice soon will have 10 more places to fill up in the Kansas City region.
On Friday, Kansas City Power & Light announced the locations of 10 new electric vehicle charging stations that are available to the public. At least five other public charging stations already exist in the metro area, said Larry Kinder, CEO of Overland Park-based LilyPad EV, which built the five existing stations.
LilyPad has been selected to build the 10 new stations as well, according to KCP&L, a subsidiary of Kansas City-based Great Plains Energy Inc. (NYSE: GXP).
The Kansas City Regional Clean Cities Coalition is working with KCP&L to administer an American Recovery and Reinvestment Act grant through the U.S. Department of Energy that will pay for the stations, which are set to be completed by the fall. Coalition Director Kelly Gilbert said the federal government is providing $150,000 for the project, and KCP&L will provide another $150,000. Site companies will absorb the cost of the electricity, according to KCP&L.
Kinder said the final cost of the stations hadn’t been determined.
KCP&L announced the new locations at the Overland Park headquarters of engineering firm Black & Veatch, the site of one of the charging stations.
Other sites include:
• Lee’s Summit City Hall
• Commerce Bank, Kansas City (13441 State Line Road, Kansas City)
• Harley-Davidson Motor Co., Kansas City
• Johnson County Community College (2), Overland Park
• Park Place (2), Leawood
• Union Station, Kansas City
• Heartland Regional Medical Center, St. Joseph, Mo.
“By working with the Kansas City Regional Clean Cities Coalition, we are able to provide the early infrastructure for electric vehicles in our community and help the Kansas City region adopt cutting-edge technology,” Roland Maliwat, KCP&L manager of sustainability products, said in a written statement.
Fully electric vehicles run entirely off their batteries and require recharging at least daily. Ranges can be limited — some electric cars can travel only 100 miles or less on a single charge, posing problems for active drivers.
Recharging times can range from five to 20 hours, meaning the best place to put charging stations is where people work, go to school or spend significant amounts of time, Kinder previously told the Kansas City Business Journal.
LilyPad installs and maintains Coulomb Electric Vehicle Charging Stations, which work with all standard electric vehicles, in Kansas and Missouri.
Kinder said that existing charging stations are at:
• Roeland Park City Hall
• Posty Cards Inc., Kansas City
• Boulevard Brewing Co., Kansas City
• Project Living Proof model house, 917 Emanuel Cleaver II Blvd., Kansas City
• University of Missouri-Kansas City main campus, administrative parking lot.Ke$ha takes OK!’s Last Word interview in the issue out now. The singer, 23, is touring with Rihanna in support of her debut album Animal.

With Left routed, trade unions face tough times
With political equations changing in bastions of Left unionism, stiff challenges await the soldiers of strikes and bandhs.
After the results of the Assembly elections, two bastions of Left-affiliated trade unionism now stand faced with two different challenges.
In West Bengal, trade unions have lost the shelter of the Left Front and will have to deal with a government not led by the Left forces for the first time in 34 years.
The offices of CITU and AITUC and the do-union-and-no-work believers of the Coordination Committee that have flourished in the past three decades will now have to face Mamata Banerjee.
In Tamil Nadu, the soldiers of strikes and bandhs will have to confront a government supported by their own brethren.

With Left routed, trade unions face tough times
Time has been witness that it is never easy. When the Left had backed Mulayam Singh Yadav's government in Uttar Pradesh, it could do nothing more than raising a few murmurs and putting up a frail protest when the state police opened fire at workers.
Travel back in time to better understand the role Left-backed trade unions have played. A few years back, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, as the chief minister of West Bengal, came to a CII event in Delhi to woo investors.
After the communist delivered a passionate speech seeking capital, a gentleman from the audience took the microphone and said, "Twenty years ago, I had a factory in Howrah. Because of CITU's atrocities, I was forced to shut my factory there and shift to Gurgaon. If I wish to return to Bengal today, can you assure me that your trade unions will not create problems?"
Bhattacharjee acknowledged the trade union trouble, saying the word "gherao" was the contribution of these unions the English dictionary.
He assured trade unions had become more responsible and investors would not have to face disruptions.

With Left routed, trade unions face tough times
After a few years, Bhattacharjee, on another investment-seeking mission, remarked at a similar event organised by the Bengal Chamber of Commerce in Kolkata that he, unfortunately, belonged to a party that called and supported bandhs.
He added he would definitely protest the next time a bandh was called. Within 24 hours, he drew strong censure from his own party, and was attacked by the bandh experts of the Left trade unions for his "insensitive remarks".
CITU President A K Padmanabhan, who spent all his years in Tamil Nadu before coming to Delhi to take all-India responsibility of the union, says: "The response of the trade union will depend entirely on the attitude of the government. We want to know from Mamata Banerjee whether workers are part of her Maa-Mati-Manush agenda or not."
He refuses to believe they would have to go slow against Jayalalithaa. "Earlier too, we have seen friendly governments. But it has nothing to do with the movement of the trade union. We are fighting for workers' rights and it will continue, irrespective of who is in power."

With Left routed, trade unions face tough times
AKP, as he is popularly called by his comrades, does not think the electoral boost to the UPA will have any effect on their unity with the Congress' Trade Union wing, INTUC.
He says, "INTUC has already made it clear that it is not looking at politics. We are united for the sake of workers. And our unity will continue." H Mahadevan, the general secretary of CPI-affiliated AITUC, also echoes the unity chant.
B P Pant, director of labour, employment and skill at Ficci feels the relevance of the Left trade union will slide further. He points out that the decline of the left unions had begun even earlier that this, as CITU slipped from the third-largest union in 1989 to the fifth-largest in 2002.
Pant says the anti employment policies of the Left and the Left trade unions have helped nobody.
"It is obvious and known to all that you have more jobs if you have pro-investment policies. But the labour policy continues to be a bottleneck," he says.
Click NEXT to read more...
With Left routed, trade unions face tough times
He refuses to accept the argument that a liberalised labour policy would necessarily have to be anti-labour.
"It would be anti-labour, provided there is no social security benefits guaranteed. No one wants that," he adds.
The unity bid of the unions does not seem to have alarmed bodies like Ficci. They feel the Left is close to vanishing as a political alternative.
Trade unions are formed to bargain on behalf of workers. The educated and trained workers in the services sector don't need anyone to argue on their behalf. The manufacturing sector that needed them has only shrunk in size.

With Left routed, trade unions face tough times
P Roy, director general of Bengal Chamber of Commerce, the country's oldest chamber, feels the rabid unionism of the 1970s is long dead and the Left has realised that closing factories doesn't help anyone.
He also feels Left unions may lose members, as there may be a trend towards chasing the power centre. There may be a lot of changing of jerseys, he says.
An uncertain future seems to be awaiting Left-affiliated trade unions and they will have to jostle for space both in Tamil Nadu and Bengal, where trade unions of Trinamool Congress and AIADMK will certainly try to grab their space.
It remains to be seen how they would sustain the competition and re-design themselves, staying relevant in even in today's times.

In order to be sure of your baby’s well-being, it is always important to visit your healthcare provider regularly, as they can inform you of problems you may not be aware of. One concern your doctor would be able to address is if your baby’s umbilical cord is compressed. Umbilical cord compression occurs when there is pressure put on the umbilical cord.
This umbilical cord compression can either occur during pregnancy or during labor. Umbilical cord compression occurs in only about 1 out 10 deliveries. The majority of compressions will occur during labor with the umbilical cord allows vital nutrients and oxygen to be passed on to your baby to the placenta, when there is extreme compression lasting for longer periods of time (i.e. more than 10 seconds), it leads to a decrease in oxygen and blood flow to your baby’s. The compression can also cause changes in your baby’s heart rate.
What are the Dangers of a Prolapsed Umbilical Cord?
When your baby’s heart rate changes as a result of compression, it can lead to complications like variable deceleration. Variable deceleration involves a fall in your baby’s heart rate; the heart rate must be greater than 15 from oxygen in the womb and can lead to other health complications including death. This is rare and something your health care provider will monitor.
What Can Cause a Prolapsed Umbilical Cord?
During labor the umbilical cord gets stretched and compressed, leading to umbilical cord compression. While you are pregnant, the hyperactivity of your baby can, on rare occasions, cause umbilical cord compression. Another cause for a Prolapsed Umbilical Cord
One of the leading treatments of umbilical cord compression is amnioinfusion. Amnioinfusion is a process that involves introducing a saline solution, at room temperature, into the uterus during labor in order to relieve labour

This may leave some of you scratching your head. But believe it or not, 11 percent of people (or about 1 in 10) think an HTML — a language used to create websites — is a sexually transmitted disease. It seems when it comes to tech terms, many Americans are clueless, found a study by coupons website Vouchercloud.net.
“Technology is a huge interest for our user base, and month after month we see thousands of people visiting our site to look for coupons and deals to use when purchasing their favorite tech products,” said a company spokeswoman in a statement. “It seems that quite a few of us need to brush up on our tech definitions.”
There were other tech terms Americans were confused by, reports The Los Angeles Times. Among them:
–Ouch that hurt! 27 percent thought a “gigabyte” was a South American insect and not a measurement unit for the storage capacity of a digital device.
–Too much time spent watching Star Trek? Forty-two percent believed a “motherboard” was “the deck of a cruise ship.” It is actually a circuit board that contains many of the main components of a computer.
— Helloooo, R2-D2. Twenty-three percent said “MP3″ was a “Star Wars” robot and not an audio file.
–Nice outfit. Fifteen percent thought “software” was comfortable clothing. It is a general term for computer programs.
–Geography 101. Twelve percent said “USB” stood for a European country. USB is a type of connector.
Despite the incorrect answers, 61 percent of the respondents said it is important to have a good knowledge of technology in this day and age.
While some questioned the survey, the firm that conducted the survey, 10 Yetis Public Relations, stands by the findings. Leanne Thomas, a senior account executive for the firm, said the survey is “100% genuine, and it’s a valid survey.”

60fps would awesome on destiny on next gen
FlyingHotPotI am afraid this won't happen until Destiny 2 is released in a couple of years. I just wished developers would just stop using this cross-gen excuse and be straight with us. If there are polls / market research etc. indicating that a game will sell a lot less on old gen if there are major differences, which is already a given, just admit it.
MaxCanonIt's strange because the game looked so beautiful and I never felt like my ps4 was choking up playing. But of course having the game run at 60 fps should be ideal. Here's an analogy, high rev your engine just to go fast or have an engine that can accelerate great and have a low rev while maintaining speed.
BabyrancherI simply want Destiny to be the best it possibly can be, on either console. Last gen is LAST GEN... Destiny would absolutely be better if it was PS4/Xbone exclusive. This is probably my only significant complaint about Destiny.

"We" included two families, mine and the Usabs, friends from the eastern shore of Maryland. We crammed four adults and our four kids, ranging in age from 6 to 13, into three canoes and set off for almost four weeks of what we originally (and optimistically) called just a "float down the river."
Now, I've canoed as much as 250 miles a day on the upper Yukon River as a two-time competitor in the Yukon Quest. But it's equally challenging when young kids are involved and you're worried about making sure they're having fun and are SAFE. This is a tall order when they're inhaling mosquitoes, paddling through water as cold as ice with big hydraulics or camping in bear country.
Our "wilderness" trip got a rocky start as we passed a sign below Whitehorse that cautioned about treated effluent being discharged into the river. Several miles below town we ran into a grocery cart sticking out of a muddy bar in a bend on the river. As we paddled across the 30-mile long Lake Lebarge, made famous by Robert Service's poetic celebration of the Cremation of Sam McGee, we saw abundant signs of humans everywhere: tent sites, rusted cans, old cables, and broken glass.
But gradually these modern archaeological artifacts disappear as we get into dining on grayling and wild onions further down the river. Saxifrage, bluebells, cinquefoil, wild sweet pea, and fleabane were flowering everywhere. Ravens stuck their heads into the holes of cliff and bank swallows to feed on nestlings and eggs. As we passed one of many spectacular cliffs along the river, a pair of peregrine falcons double-teamed a swallow and snatched it out of the air in front of our canoes.
The outbreak of leaf miners on aspen and birch made the trees growing along the banks unusually silvery as a result of the larvae eating all of the green chlorophyll tissue under the waxy cuticle that covers each leaf.
At one point, we saw a black bear trying desperately to swim to shore before we intercepted it's trajectory with our canoes. Red-breasted merganser broods were everywhere.
Older signs of First Nation people and the Klondike gold rush that we saw further down the river seem part of the natural landscape in a way that the modern litter below Whitehorse did not. Below the mouth of the Teslin River we poked around the abandoned village of Houtalinqua, which once serviced the Klondike steamers and transmitted telegraphs. At the mouth of the Big Salmon River, we had lunch at a site that was once a village for the Tutchone, an Athabascan tribe, and later a fur trading post.
At the fully restored Fort Selkirk, below the mouth of the Pelly River, the kids (and the adults) were entertained and educated by Papa Don, a transplanted Ojibwa Indian, who tells handed-down stories of important things to know like why bears have short tails. You'll have to go there yourself to find out the answer.
Somewhere along the way, we passed Stewart's Island, which once hosted a couple of communities, including the cabin where Jack London overwintered before the Klondike Gold Rush. He only spent a year in the Yukon, during which time he got scurvy and lost all of his money. But his eidetic memory of the conversations that he had with other miners and trappers during the winter of 1897 gave him the setting for his many subsequent books, including Call of the Wild. His cabin was later moved to Dawson City as a historical site, where it was literally cut in half horizontally. The lower half remains there but the upper half was taken to Oakland, Calif., where Jack hailed from and where a duplicate cabin has been restored.
And somewhere along the way, I got to watch our kids grow up just a little bit more. Despite the absence of electronic gadgetry, which I had forbidden, they had memorable times panning for gold, fishing, paddling, poking fires, telling stories, and singing. Mika, my 11-year old daughter, grinned wildly from the bow as we shot through Five Finger Rapids. Charly, my 6-year old daughter, never, ever complained although at one point she was pretty close to being hypothermic.
We so settled into traveling on the river that when we were stuck in our tent for two nights as it rained for 30 hours straight somewhere along the international border between Yukon and Alaska, we just enjoyed sleeping and reading and eating and being with each other. I'm not sure who said it's the journey that counts, not the destination, but I think we accomplished a bit of what I had hoped for two years ago.

For the past couple of years, we have heard about austerity in Europe but few Americans seem to realize that austerity is coming sooner or later to our shores. Amazingly, it appears that few Americans even knew what the Fiscal Cliff was about until it became more widely discussed in the Presidential debates.
A recent Fortune article summarizes that Fiscal Cliff concerns are finally catching up with the average American and it states:
"Meanwhile, the rest of America either wasn't paying attention or didn't really care. Consumer confidence in November spiked to more than a four-year high. Since the presidential election, though, there's been a marked shift, Duke says, referring to polls that Wal-Mart (NYSE."
Many Americans are being led to believe by the media and government officials that all will be well and that we could even see a big rally if a deal is reached on the Fiscal Cliff by Congress and President Obama. But that appears to be a fantasy since a deal is likely to entail tax increases and some government spending cuts which could put a major dent into an already weak economy. Countries like Spain, Portugal, and Greece which have cut government spending and raised taxes (otherwise known as austerity), have subsequently seen a sharp drop in economic activity and an increase in unemployment. It now seems that more investors and analysts are willing to acknowledge that a Fiscal Cliff deal is likely to involve austerity. CNBC's Bob Pisani's "Trader Talk" article recently stated:
"Though."
The CEO of Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Lloyd Blankfein also seems to recognize that austerity is coming and that it will pose challenges to the economy as a recent CNN Money article states:
"The next 12 months will be tricky," warned Blankfein, speaking at a conference Wednesday hosted by The New York Times' Dealbook. "Any compromise will involve some dose of austerity -- a deflationary policy."
The markets have been in rally mode (ever since the post-election sell-off the S&P 500 Index (NYSEARCA:SPY) has jumped from about 1350 to around 1421, although it has become a bit jittery in recent days) and investors seem to be taking a "what, me worry" approach to the potential risks of going off the Fiscal Cliff as well as what ensuing austerity could do to the American economy in 2013. If a deal is reached in which major spending cuts and tax hikes are implemented, austerity is coming. Just take a look at stocks in the defense sector which could be hit hardest by going off the Fiscal Cliff and you can see that shares of General Dynamics (NYSE:GD) and Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) are trading near the high end of the recent trading range. (General Dynamics has jumped from about $62 in mid-November to over $67 and Raytheon has surged from about $54 to over $57 in the same time period.) By looking at those stocks, you would not even know that multi-billion dollar defense spending cuts were looming. The abundance of optimism that a Fiscal Cliff deal will be reached and the fact that the markets have been rallying should concern investors, along with the fact that if a deal is reached, austerity will start to impact the U.S. economy in 2013. It seems that most investors are betting on a Fiscal Cliff deal and are bidding up defense stocks and judging by how slow most Americans were to understand and acknowledge the Fiscal Cliff, it is not surprising that they would not yet be grasping the potential impact of austerity in 2013. Once and if a Fiscal Cliff deal is made, the media is likely to start assessing the toll budget cuts and tax hikes will take on our economy and that is when more investors might re-position their portfolios. But for now, the stock market does not appear to have priced-in either a going off the Fiscal Cliff scenario or the austerity that is coming. That means a significant sell-off is possible in the near future, as is a recession in 2013, which could be driven by austerity.
Investors who want to stay one step ahead of the average American should consider raising cash now and prepare for what could be a much better buying opportunity in the stock market once we either go off the Fiscal Cliff or once investors fully realize that a deal is likely to bring the same austerity countries in Europe have experienced, when governments cut spending and raise taxes. Investors should consider selling the recently rally in defense stocks and other sectors. Cash should be on-hand for better buying opportunities in companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) which has growth potential even in a weak economy and a cash-rich balance sheet. Companies and countries that have a strong financial position will be poised to take advantage of opportunities that could come with a recession, while companies with significant debt levels and heavy exposure to economic downturns are likely to be more challenged. Earlier this year it was reported that Apple had more cash on hand than the United States Treasury, and with the recent decline in the share price over "growth concerns", it sure seems like a better stock to be buying on dips especially compared to defense stocks (as if those companies are going to see strong growth in the coming years). As of the latest quarter, Apple has about $121 billion on the balance sheet and in contrast to many stocks in the market, Apple shares have already priced-in slower growth which seems likely for most companies in 2013. The recent market run does not make sense, and as the reality of austerity comes into play sooner or later, investors who are well-prepared might be able to buy into high-quality stocks in cash-rich companies at what might be lower levels. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) comes to mind as it has a relatively stable revenue stream from its Windows operating system and like Apple, it has a fortress-like balance sheet with about $66 billion in cash and just around $12.37 billion in debt. Microsoft shares have also dropped (like Apple) from about $29 in early November to below $27 today, in what seems to be a case where the market is pricing in slower growth expectations for Windows 8. Cash-rich companies whose stocks have already price in lower growth expectations are likely to outperform stocks that have been bid up recently on (possibly false or misguided) optimism over a Fiscal Cliff deal..Law Admissions

Coach: Rosemary Ferguson (1st season back at Sharpsville, 9th season overall)
2012 overall record: 16-4
2012 region record: 14-0 (champion)
2012 playoff results: Swept Cochranton in the District 10 Class A semifinals before losing to Maplewood in four games in the District 10 championship.
Top players lost: Alexis Ferrara, Madelyn Shuttleworth, Paige Scurpa, Kristen Scurpa
Top returning players: Megan Davis, Rachael D’Auria, Rachel Harenchar, Madison Priczina, Emily Anderson
Assistant coaches: Sophie Paddock, Lauren Belin
Outlook: Sharpsville is under new direction from a coach that is familiar to the area. Rosemary Ferguson returns to the sidelines to coach the Blue Devils this fall. Sharpsville will have some major holes to fill with the graduation of Alexis Ferrara, Madelyn Shuttleworth, Paige Scurpa and Kristen Scurpa. Paige (outside hitter) and Kristen (setter) Scurpa were voted to the all-region first team, while Ferrara was voted to the first team as a libero. Shuttleworth was voted to the all-region second team and all four will be tough to replace for the Blue Devils. Sharpsville returns Megan Davis, Rachael D’Auria, Rachel Harenchar, Madison Priczina and Emily Anderson. Davis was voted to the all-region second team as an outside hitter and will be counted on to lead a young team. Davis is part of a strong senior class along with D’Auria, a middle hitter, and Harenchar, a libero. Priczina is back at setter and Anderson at middle hitter as juniors. Sharpsville could also receive immediate contributions from new players Kara Morrin, Miley Sikorski, Emily Sackett, Alivia Shuttleworth along with sophomores Abby Ferlin, Leah LaRocca and Emma Gerasimek. The Blue Devils have plenty of leadership to replace from graduation. With a new coach and a new system in place, it may take Sharpsville a few matches to build chemistry, but the program is strong enough to reload. Look for the Blue Devils to contend in Region 1 and in District 10 Class A.

Instead of trying anything new, most of them, even the exciting ones, played on our nostalgia for their pleasures. The Audi ad was basically a John Hughes movie in miniature. Budweiser trotted out a baby Clydesdale and had us watch him grow up. Even the Willem Dafoe ad, in which he played the devil, used a Rolling Stones song to charm us. Destiny's Child, reunited for the first time since 2006, tipped their hat to Charlie's Angels.
Then there was the Dodge Ram ad dedicated to farmers. The aesthetic template for it had already been set, by Levi's sentimental work-themed ads and Clint Eastwood's solemn Chrysler commercial last year. It may have been the most nostalgic spot of all, actually. But among all the other ads drowning in celebrity cameos and Twitter hashtags, it actually managed to be effective. The use of all still photography shots isn't something I can remember seeing recently. The photos were stark. The narration was offhand (literally so, taken from the late Paul Harvey's 1978 address). It's hard to call ads like these — and for that matter, Eastwood's work — conservative. They exist to remind us that we are all part of one country, which is something hardly ever done outside of Obama speeches. It was by far the ballsiest ad in the whole game.
If only more companies tried to surprise us with their Super Bowl ads. They spend a whole lot of money to look more and more like all the other guys. It was nice to see Seth Rogen and Paul Rudd together again, but all they were doing was... being Seth Rogen and Paul Rudd. The next time someone spends $3.6 million on a Super Bowl ad, I'd really like them to show us what that money means, not just soothe our nostalgia. Maybe they could even shock us.

Two people are dead and three were injured after a BRP boat trial resulted in a two-vessel crash at a southern Illinois lake when a crisscrossing maneuver went awry.
Instead of crisscrossing, a boat carrying two people plunged into a second boat with three aboard during the trial run Tuesday on Rend Lake in Benton, Ill., sending the first vessel aground at top speed, local officials told Soundings Trade Only.
Both occupants of that boat were killed, according to Jerry Hiller, the Region Five captain with the Illinois Department of Natural Resources. The three people in the other boat had non-life-threatening injuries, according to a BRP release.
“Of course, it’s still under investigation, but the best we can tell, both boats got up on plane, which means they were moving at a high rate of speed,” Hillercrossing, and one boat ran over the other one and killed both of them.”
Both boats were operated by BRP employees; the passengers were employees from Milsco Manufacturing Co.’s Mexico location, according to Hiller and BRP.
The operator of the vessel that ran aground, Larry Smithhart, was employed at BRP’s Palm Bay, Fla., facility.
His body was recovered in about 8 feet of water Wednesday afternoon, Franklin County Sheriff Don Jones told Soundings Trade Only.
Teresa Camargo, who worked at BRP supplier Milsco Mexico, also was killed, according to the BRP release. Another Milsco employee was hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries. The other two people involved had minor injuries and were not hospitalized.
Camargo was found on land, alive but with severe head injuries, after being ejected from the boat when it ran aground, Jones said. She was airlifted to a St. Louis hospital, but “didn’t live long,” Jones said.
Occupants of the second boat told responders there was another person on the vessel that ran aground, Jones said.
“Nobody knew where the guy was at first,” Jones said. “After it became apparent he was not on land, we focused more on water.”
Several local agencies began to search the vast lake — the second-largest man-made lake in Illinois — including the Army Corps of Engineers, the Department of Natural Resources and the county sheriff’s department, Jones said.
“Once the body was located by sonar by IDNR, members of my dive team actually recovered the body, so it was a cooperative effort all the way around,” Jones said.
The Department of Natural Resources expects to wrap up the investigation on Friday, Hiller said.
Hiller was in transit between offices and did not have access to reports, but he believed that the boat carrying the two people who were killed was a four-passenger Sea-Doo.
The other vessel was a little bigger, “a basic recreational variety,” Hiller said.
“It goes without saying that these events are heartbreaking for all of us and the affected families and friends,” BRP said in a statement.
“BRP is currently assessing and focused on the needs of the family members and all others involved,” the statement read. “BRP is taking all appropriate actions to meet those needs.”
“There’s not much more we can say at this time,” BRP spokeswoman Johanne Denault told Soundings Trade Only. “There’s an investigation going on.”

Priority One’s M.C.H.C Calcium provides microcrystalline hydroxyapatite (MCHC)‚ which is a unique form of calcium that may act to maintain healthy bones.
Since M.C.H.C Calcium is derived from whole animal bones‚ it also contains a blend of nutrients that your own bones need to stay strong. For example‚ osteocalcin is a protein that binds to calcium; as a result‚ it may play a role in building and preserving bone mass.
Moreover‚ microcrystalline hydroxyapatite is a good source of collagen‚ which is a protein that is a key component of bone matter. Notably‚ collagen could potentially keep your bones from becoming brittle. Therefore‚ M.C.H.C Calcium might work to preserve bone density in older women.
Last‚ this Priority One supplement provides nutrients like manganese and vitamin K because they might offer additional support for strong bones and teeth.

This week’s installment is a bit different; I didn’t write the interview, but wanted to share it because their PC story briefly touched mine.)
Photo of Ron and Nancy Tschetter in India from
I met Ron and Nancy in February of 2008 when they visited Bitola, Macedonia where I was assigned as a Peace Corps Volunteer (PCV) from 2006-2009. Ron was the world-wide Director of the Peace Corps (PC) then, and he and Nancy were on an official visit to Macedonia. Since they were scheduled to visit my city, a fellow PCV on the planning committee asked me if I would help with the arrangements for a luncheon PC wanted to have in Bitola. I said “Sure”, which made me the local arrangements liaison. We hosted the luncheon at one of my favorite restaurants in Bitola in the Hotel Millenium.
PCVs from the surrounding cities and villages were invited to attend the luncheon along with local dignitaries and the PC Macedonia Director and some PC Macedonia staff. (Each country in which PCVs serve has an American PC Director along with a program director and administrator officer. Additional staff are hired locally and make up about 90% of the total in-country staff.)
I really enjoyed meeting and talking with Ron and Nancy. They embodied the vision I had of Peace Corps growing-up – young Americans stepping out into the world to offer their skills, and then finding ways to continue to give back to their country and culture after their return to the States.
I sat next to Ron at the luncheon and we talked a bit about service to one’s country and the different forms it can take. We discussed how great it was that our government offered us the opportunity to join Peace Corps in very different decades, at very different ages – they joined in their 20’s; I joined in my 50’s – and in very different places – they served in India; I was serving in southeastern Europe – and how Peace Corps had still turned out to be perfect for each of us.
We also talked about how you truly never know what life holds for you. Their lives had come full circle from serving as Peace Corps Volunteers to Ron being appointed as Director of Peace Corps more than four decades later. Sitting there talking to him, I realized my life had circled back allowing me to live out my childhood dream of serving in the Peace Corps. In different ways Peace Corps had allowed both of us to create the lives we wanted.
The interesting thing about creating the life you want is that it can lead you to exciting, exotic places and to amazing meeting and moments, but the most important part of all is whether or not the life you are creating leads you full circle back to yourself – the real you, the person you truly enjoy being. That’s when you know you are on the right journey.
Here’s a bit of Ron and Nancy Tschetter’s journey from the Peace Corps’ Paul D. Cordell World Wise Schools Stories web page, where you will find more interesting tales from those who served in the Peace Corps. Next Wednesday, I will share the last of my “Peace Corps, Up Close and Personal” interviews for March. I am hoping to feature at least one interview a month through 2011 as part of my ongoing celebration of Peace Corps 50th Anniversary.
Peace Corps India, 1966-1968 by Ron and Nancy Tschetter
Ron:
As Director of the Peace Corps, it has been my honor to have met Peace Corps Volunteers all over the world and to have seen firsthand the remarkable dedication, passion, and skill they bring to serving others.
My wife, Nancy, and I were Peace Corps Volunteers in India from 1966 to 1968. We were in our 20s, recent college graduates and newlyweds, when we decided to serve in the Peace Corps. We spent two years living and working with the people of India and learned to speak the local language. We came away from our experience with a great appreciation for the culture and values in India.
Nancy:
The Peace Corps was a bit different back in the Sixties—nowadays Volunteers do their training in-country to become familiar with the culture and language, but back then our training was held in the United States, and we were sent overseas when it was time to begin our assignment. We completed our training on December 15, and, after an evening out and one last dinner in New York City, we left the Big Apple on a plane bound for London and the great beyond.
The following evening we boarded an Air India charter, a Boeing 707 full of anxious Peace Corps Volunteers just like ourselves. We flew all night to Delhi, India. I will never forget when we arrived, stepping off the plane: the smoky haze that rose from hundreds of small brown huts; the exotic smell of dinner prepared over wood fires; the pungent tropical air. We were truly on the other side of the world in a culture very different from our own.
It was midnight Christmas Eve when we finally arrived at our new community. Undeterred by the late hour, Bara, our proud host, gave us a short tour of the village, including the centerpiece of local entertainment—an outdoor movie theater that was in full swing, loud music blaring.
Decades later, I can still recall our exhaustion when we finally arrived at our house. It was situated among a block of shops, all resembling one another. Here, traders would sell their wares from the ground floor and live upstairs on the second floor.
Bara found us some plain metal bed frames, on loan from the clinic until we got our own, and we threw our sleeping bags on the frames and fell right to sleep. We didn’t even realize we had a bedroom on the second floor until the next day! Things were very basic. We had a tank that we would fill with water, and a”basket latrine” inside the house. A little balcony upstairs added a touch of luxury.
Ron:
We gradually became acquainted with our environment. India at that time still revolved around a caste system, and we lived among the people we were to serve; they were called “untouchables.” These were people from the lowest caste in Indian society, and they were very, very poor. Together with our Indian counterparts, we worked in a community health center at the other end of the village about a quarter of a mile away. We came to know our neighbors by walking to and from the clinic. From assisting in the clinic and living in our local community, we quickly learned about the development problems related to rural health. Certain illnesses such as dysentery, cholera, and malaria took their toll, and children were subject to catching every sort of childhood disease. Epidemics such as small pox and cholera could wreak havoc on a population already struggling.
Nancy:
It was natural to wonder then how much of an impact we were making in the face of such widespread poverty. We knew our Peace Corps experience clearly expanded our horizons and taught us a great deal about how life is for people who are struggling in other parts of the world. We learned to appreciate what we have as Americans, and how as global citizens we have a responsibility to others who are less fortunate. But was it really possible for two young people to make a difference? It may be simply that we influenced one person, or one family, or one village in a faraway place. However, the effect was no less significant, for those individuals were the people we had come to know and care about during our years of Peace Corps service.
Two young boys from a lower caste family that lived close by were in the habit of hanging out on our front porch. We gradually got to know them and their family quite well, and we became close friends. We have been fortunate to go back to India five times and have kept in contact with the family we knew so well. We do know that we impacted at least two people—the young boys who used to hang out on our doorstep. Both of them finished school and grew up to be successful businessmen, and each has three lovely children.
Ron:
Since becoming Peace Corps Director, I have had the privilege of visiting Volunteers in 43 countries, from Albania to Zambia . I’ve seen that the challenges now are as great as they were back when Nancy and I served, or maybe even greater. I continue to be deeply impressed by the commitment of our Peace Corps Volunteers.
Though it was many years ago, our Peace Corps experience still reverberates in our lives and the lives of those with whom we were honored to work. You see, once you do something so bold, so enriching, and so all-encompassing, you realize that volunteering and giving to others is actually a gift to yourself. Our lives, and certainly our perspectives, were changed forever.

Here's an interesting link to a 9/11 skeptic who uses his decades as a professional photographer to question what we were told and presented in photos.
General Introduction
Jack White BA has been a professional photographer for more than fifty years. White's specialty is photoanalysis. In these 9/11 photo studies, Jack White investigates the provenance of the images. He considers the trustworthiness of the pictures and examines in considerable detail the record of events.
Jack White's 911 Photo Studies question the AUTHENTICITY of the photographs themselves. All studies are intended to raise the following questions:
1. Did the events depicted occur as shown?
2. Did the events occur when shown?
3. Were the events shown physically possible?
4. Are some events and objects shown mutually exclusive?
5. Were some of the events staged?
6. Did whistle-blowers insert "mistakes" on purpose?
7. Were many photos altered, manipulated or retouched?
If even one faked "official" image can be proven, all official photos become suspect. One may wish to ask several further questions:
a) Were the events of 9/11 staged as a New Pearl Harbor – a horrific propaganda event to justify the US conducting invasions and going to war?
b) Were photographs posed or fabricated as powerful propaganda tools?
c) Were persons in power responsible for the 9/11 atrocities?
If citizens of the United States and elsewhere cannot trust the official photographs and imagery of 9/11, why should anyone trust the official account?
Yes, I just saw this yesterday and was looking for the downed light poles. Didn't see them. Good catch.
For starters, I trust that most people visiting this site know that no commercial airliner hit the Pentagon. That is obvious. As to the photos, the hole in the inside of the "C" ring was made by a backhoe; it could not have been made by the nosecone of a 757. That should also be obvious.
However, photos of the space between the "C" and "B" ring should raise an obvious question. Since there is nothing but about 40 feet of blank space between the two, with nothing but air in between them, then if the "plane" had enough power to completely punch through the inside wall of the "C" ring, then what prevented it from impacting the outside wall of the "B" ring, eh?
Again, pretty obvious.
There is one downed light pole in the video at the 3:46 mark.
What I find conspicuous in it's absence is the moment of the collapse of the section of the Pentagon that had been hit. I find it odd that someone video tapping that event would completely miss something that dramatic. More likely since this is an FBI release, they removed that part for whatever reason.
In this video and these photos again, it is what is missing that is key. There are no 9 ton jet engines which would have survived in some form. There are not airliner seats. There is no luggage that I can see. No tail section which would have broken off, no wing sections that would have broken off. Nada. Zip. Zilch.
More than likely what hit the Pentagon was a laser or GPS guided drone painted and perhaps even modified to resemble a smaller scale AA 757-200, but don't say that too loud or the thought police of the movement will accuse you.
The orange markings on the wall appear to be unfinished reverse pentagons.
Par for the course, i guess.
cheers
pentagrams , sorry
cheers
Hi all.
willy, if you get a chance, here's screenshots of 3:46 and 3:48. Please let me know what you're seeing there.
Greg, yeah. All of the FBI and NIST photos are suspect.
aferris, the markings are strange to me too.
anon @ 10:23 AM, yeah, the B ring looks to be in pretty good shape.
Ok Kenny. Take a look at this side by side comparison I did of the still from the video and the image you linked to from Blogger.
You will notice that the angle is obviously slightly different, but, as you can see the same 5 crucial elements are there in the same relation to each other:
1 Pole 3
2 small tree
3 Pole 3 base
4 guard rail that stops prior to the road running off to the right (off ramp)
5 off ramp
That long thing on the ground there on the far right side of the image is Pole 3 and there is no doubt about it.
That is not to say that it wasn't staged in that position. I think it was due to the fact that the ground isn't damaged at all around the pole. They are all like that.
But, that video clearly shows Pole 3.
willy, I see what you're saying. There's even a better view at 3:54.
Yeah, you're right. They zoomed in on it didn't they? My first comment mentioning the pole gave the time stamp of the first moments of that segment. As they pan around and then zoom in, it's pretty clear what that is when you compare it to the photos you linked to on Blogger.
Again, I think what is clearly missing from that video though are 1. luggage 2. seats 3. bodies 4. 2 nine ton engines 5. tail sections 6. wing sections
Something hit that building. Something that had wings and a tail made of a composite graphite like a drone, that would shatter on impact rather than crumple up like aluminum wings and tail sections of a 757-200.
And considering that a drone doesn't have seats and luggage, that would be my guess.
I added your graphic as an update. Thanks.
Now, what about the photo of the pentagon @ 5:22 PM comment? It was taken some time after the event. The 'B' ring?
I guess that should be the 'D' ring.
Look at the picture again. What you will notice is the ring between the entrance hole (outer ring) and the hole punched in the 3rd ring (C) doesn't appear damaged. The emphasis is on "appear"
Look and you will see that the rings themselves are 5 stories tall, but you can clearly see a ceiling between the two rings (D and C) and that is because there was a ceiling between them. The same is true for the space between E and D. They also had enclosed walkways for the upper 3 floors.
There is no hole visible because the damage between them is underneath that roof.
So there is some damage in the second ring there. I think there would be a hell of a lot more if a 757-200 hit that building.
It looks like inverted anarchy (circle A) signs on the side of the pentragram building. -Dr.Strangelove-
dont see a backhoe making the circular hole.
nor a drone.
certainly no 700 series plane made the very nice circular hole touching the ground.
how do the cheney-wolfowitz-zellikow crowd explain this piece of evidence?
The Global Hawk has one jet engine over the body of the drone. If anything would make a punch-out hole in the 3rd ring, it would have been an engine. 757? Two holes. Drone? one
Anyone who questions the official narrative is a goddamn terrorist!.
Well lets see, for starters the pilot was military connected, as well as many of the passengers on the supposed Flight 77. Faking a few, or even say 90 or so idendities isn't exactly a tall task for the zionists and neocons(including Pentagon connected like Rumsfeld and Zakheim) who pulled off 9/11. The "what happened to the passengers" argument is one I hear often from official story pushers though. Mike "formerly of NASA wink wink" Rivero can say whatever he wants about what hit the Pentagon. I don't care.
And the planes that hit the towers were holographic projections whose passengers never existed either, right?
This no plane nonsense has got to be the most pathetic attempt at poisoning the well ever.
Yeah, they always come back after all the evidence we present and say "well, what happened to the passengers? Did they just kill them?"
First: How the hell would I know what happened to the passengers? All I am doing is talking about the physical evidence that proves Flight 77 (or no other 757-200) did not hit the Pentagon on Sept.11th 2001. The ONLY people would WOULD know what happened to the passengers, are the people who staged the event in the first place. And contrary to what people like Rivero say, I ain't one of those people.
Second: Why is it so unbelievable that the same people who murdered 2,000+ people in the Twin Towers when they demoed the building, may have landed Flight 77 somewhere else (remember that little detour the plane took?) and killed those passengers as well? Why is that so unreasonable and the setting off of high explosives in an occupied building isn't?
I don't know what happened to those passengers. But I do know the evidence shows that it was not flight 77 that hit the Pentagon.
And do not try to conflate the holograms bullshit with the hard evidence that Flight 77 did not hit the Pentagon.
There are plenty of videos showing the planes hit the Twin Towers and they still haven't released the 80 videos showing whatever it was hit the Pentagon.
VASTLY different thing.
Anon@11:57, congrats on hitting another obvious tried and true disinfo ploy-conflating "holograms at the towers" with those who question what specifically hit the Pentagon. How fucking lazy are you?
I think it's highly likely that the same disinfo agents who concocted the no planes at the towers crap are also the ones who concocted the no plane at the pentagon crap.
That's why I "conflated" them.
Is that you Jon Gold?
That does sound like Jon Gold doesn't it?
Well, there are literally TONS of hard physical evidence that two planes struck the Twin Towers aside from video tapped footage of both strikes.
There is in fact NO hard evidence that Flight 77 hit the Pentagon. None what-so-ever.
There is however hard evidence and witness statements suggesting that something a bit smaller than a 757-200 hit the Pentagon, something that may have been painted to resemble flight 77.
These two theories are completely different in regard to those obvious and well documented facts.
So the ONLY reason to "conflate" the two is to attempt to discredit one by association with the other.
That is the kind of thing that Morgan Reynolds wanted when he created the bullshit holograms "no planes" theory... and you are certainly doing his work for him.
I am sure he would appreciate your efforts.
And yes, my guess would be Jon Gold or Victronox or Arabesque or any of those other Truefaction favs.
I defy any of these imbeciles who state that there is proof that commercial airliners hit the WTC provide the actual proof -- NOT the "official" conspiracy theory -- that it occurred. Any dime-a-dozen video editor can slap a "plane" into a video in 5 minutes, and there is a time delay between when something happens and when you see it on TV, even if it's "live." It's only been 10-1/2 years now, you stooges. It's not up to anybody to prove that commercial airliners DIDN'T hit the WTC; it's up to you state-huggers to prove that they DID, and the story out of the criminal murderers in DC is not EVIDENCE. Where is your PHYSICAL PROOF?
Do you people give the criminal scum in DC hand jobs in the alley for crack? Do you have Israeli bar codes stamped on your asses? How can anybody possibly be stupid enough to believe this garbage after all this time? What a scathing indictment of the so-called "education" system.
And I'll bet that you still believe that a "plane" with 65 tons of aluminum, steel and titanium could "vaporize" into thin air, but that they could recover usable DNA and fucking suicide notes from the same site, right? And you people vote and reproduce?
And right on time we have a real "no planer" show up...
hell, it's almost as if Jon Gold didn't like the tone of the discussion so he called his friend Morgan Reynolds and asked him to pop on over and bolster his claim.
Wow. Now that's some coincidence, huh?
anyone pushing planes at this date is up to no good, they belong in the slow typing class
another lying 911 shill is video rebels blog, he says there were 3000 victims at 911, and he repeats and repeats it, I dunno how he arrived at the number, maybe CNN, they're video rebels too
No planers at the WTC are liars or useful idiots. Conversely, those who push Flight 77 hitting the Pentagon are also liars and shills.
This is great! We get the missing plane at the pentagram conflated with Michael Jackson, Elvis and Santa Clause. We get name calling about Jon somebody. We get somebody (Israeli?) citing the lack of a BOEING as "No-Plane", thereby conflating 'hologram' BS with other BS and name calling and yet we're supposed to just admit the damage at the Pentagram WAS caused by a jet because some anon jerk says it's stupid. It is to laugh.
And right on schedule there's the moran shouting out "what about the children?", oops, I mean passengers when there's no evidence flight 77 even existed! Memorial sites are rife with pictures containing the wrong EXIF data (VicSims!), tenant records show the twin towers were nearly empty, Flight 93 couldn't even burn a patch of grass ("Let's Roll" - woohoo!) and here it's all supposed to go away because Anonymous said...
.
February 1, 2012 9:54 AM"
Well WOW! He's convinced ME!
So Anon, go read up on what's over here: and take it back home to your Ashkenazi buddies.
wow. look at that line-up at 9/11 solution: "Fake victims", "tv fakery", and nukes being buried in the limestone at Ground Zero since 1969 just waiting to bring down the towers.
Mention Jon Gold and Morgan Reynolds and they come pouring out of the woodwork don't they?
Hey all, sorry I'm a bit late showing up to this discussion.
I'm totally convinced the videos and planes (and thus, many of the victims) were faked in NYC on 9/11 for many reasons. Those pushing the planes in NYC are completely ignoring the work of September Clues, Christopher Holmes, Jim Fetzer, Killtown, Phil Jayhan/Larry McWilliams of Let's Roll 9/11, Dean Hartwell, and others who have discussed these issues AT LENGTH on numerous occasions and in numerous articles and books you can find in print or online. I have links to all of these sources directly on my blog for those that really want to understand this subject. It's a major part of the PSYOP aspect of 9/11.

Oh really? Do enlighten us.
How do you explain the "nose out" shot on TV? How do you explain the fact that the technology to alter live video feeds has been around FOR DECADES NOW, well before 9/11? How do you explain all the media and government insiders pushing the "planes hit the WTC" on 9/11 when many eye witnesses claimed it was a missile or small aircraft or explosions in the buildings? How can an airplane literally pass through a steel and concrete building as if it provided no resistance? How do you explain the history of the government faking or altering evidence in major crimes, like the JFK assassination, in which the Zapruder film was in fact altered? 9/11 was no different folks. The videos were FAKED, and those that can't recognize this fact after all these years NEVER WILL apparently. Just look at the various videos in NYC that day -- it's so obvious if you have an open mind.
Those who push the planes and victims in NYC and get all up in arms with those of us who have done our homework on this subject are the ones up to no good.
It's a shame we can't have an honest discussion about this subject without causing a shitstorm.
Bottom line: EVERYTHING the government and media tell us is a lie, especially when it comes to 9/11.
BTW- thanks kenny for hosting these discussions, er, I mean back and forth, childish bickering matches. :)
Well lookie there, they called in the big guns. I wonder if Morgan Reynolds (founder of the "no planes" theory and Bush administration Commerce Department head) is next.
Ok, well, if I gotta do it, I gotta do it.
Wow, what a who's who list of fake "truthers" you roll out. Killtown? Phil Jayhan? September Clues? Jim Fetzer? Why don't you toss Judy Wood and her "ray beams from space" in there as well. I mean, if the object here is to reduce serious discussion about the events of 9/11 into a discusting and insulting diatribe of bullshit, why not use ALL the phonies at your command?
Phil Jayhan runs around saying that no people died on 9/11. There are no victims. That pretty much makes all the victims family members, friends, and loved ones liars. That's a particularly effective way to make the Truth movement look like a bunch of assholes, now isn't it?
The "no planes" theory, made by a Bush Commerce Department flunky, is also designed (and I chose that work carefully) to make us look like idiots and whack-jobs. That one is kinda in the same ball park as "ray beams from space" and it's no coincidence since Jim Fetzer put Morgan Reynolds and Judy Wood together in the same ironically named "Scholars for 9/11 Truth" company.
No one is buying your bullshit here "Friend" but you did get one thing right... your website is "..a major part of the PSYOP aspect of 9/11"
You got that right.
You know, I have more respect for the asshole JREF debunkers than I do your kind "Friend". At least they believe what they write however misguided they are they aren't trying to pretend to be something they aren't in order to discredit what you must understand to be a legitimate movement. In short, they aren't traitorous pieces of crap, they're just misinformed. You and your ilk on the other hand "Friend"...
gotta go with willyloman at 935 am.
"no planes" is nonsense and its purpose is to make questioners of the cheney-wolfowitz-zelikow narrative appear as fools therefore dismissable.
Not only that, but the "no planes" meme directly shields those involved with "hijacking" the planes remotely. Which when you consider Dov Zakheim and SPC's ties you are also shielding Israels role in the false flag. No planes is about both discrediting 9/11 truth and muddying the waters among those involved in it.
I say this as someone who believes its possible the video was manipulated in some way(to conceal a possible plane swap). I do not believe John Friend is some kind of psy op runner, he and many others likely truly believe that "no planes" were involved. I believe they are being misled and are letting certain suspects off the hook in doing so.
Ahh 9/11 truth discussions. It makes my heart swell with pride lol.
Annnyway, I was minimally involved in 9/11 truth a few years back. I used to correspond with a few guys: Eric Hufschmid (yes THE Eric Hufschmid :D), Daryl Bradford Smith, and it was I that determined that Christopher Bollyn had buggered off to Estonia (!! yes I am that great :D).
Annnyway(2), the bad guys really did do a good job of co-opting (or of course) running the whole 9/11 truth thing from the get go. It looks like the disintegration is still going on despite some great work by the CIT guys etc..
Its quite fascinating to see really.
Anyhow, I've got just a thought since I never see their names mentioned at all when it comes to 9/11, and 9/11 truth.
Has anyone dug into the Naudet brothers at any stage in the last few years??
They just "happened" to be in the right place at the right time to film the first plane hitting ... and thats always been just a tiny bit suspicious to me. Like the passports just happened to survive the jet fuel, the collapse of the towers etc.
So anyone know anything interesting about the Naudet brother? ... or why people still talk about Jim Fetzer (jeez you could tell he was a shill in 2007 :D).
Best wishes
Harvey P.
I always found the Naudets to be suspicious myself. I dont really know mcuh about their backgrounds though.
As for shills, Fetzer is obviously one but so is Rupert Murdochs son in law Eric Hufschmid. And while Bollyn has done a lot of great work, particularly on the circumstantial evidence front and tying things together, hes obviously not on the up and up and was likely meant to discredit those who would inevitably start to piece together the evidence of Israeli involvement in 9/11.
if you wonder about naudet bros, you need to try reading. it was resloved at lets roll forum, they work for the perps.
to everyone who saw planes, plese post here-
where you saw them
what kind of planes
Shut the fuck up Anon@3:22. Lets Roll forums are disinfo(not that there isnt some things worth reading there) so I havent been there in awhile. Eat a dick bitch.
"it was resolved..". Sure it was fucko. Whatever Phil says right dickbag? Try thinking for yourself assclown. That way maybe you wouldnt be so quick to fall for obvious disinfo like no planes at WTC. Fucking moron.
wow. Looks like the verdict is in "Friend". Take your BS and your sock puppets elsewhere.
Hey kenny, my comment didn't get published. Maybe went to spam?
Willyloman, you're real good with the ad hominem attacks, but I haven't seen you post one single piece of actual evidence to back up your assertions. And if you don't believe the BS about "Flight 77," then why do you believe any other part of the "official" conspiracy theory? Isn't this called a "limited hangout?"
Who's the real disinfo agent here?
hey Willyloman, how's the weather in Tel Aviv?
Wow... this is the second time I have just submitted a lengthy comment that has been completely erased.
OK- willyoman, you have got to be kidding me dude! You made nothing but baseless accusations against me and all the other sources I cited without addressing a single question I raised.
Let's see if you're an honest guy. What do you have to say to Col. George Nelson, retired US Air Force accident investigator, who said:
."
Once again, all I'm saying is that there is NO EVIDENCE of any Boeing 757/767s anywhere on 9/11, not necessarily that there were "no planes". Many eye witnesses saw a missile or a small plane:
There were even planted eyewitnesses, like this guy at the beginning of this video:
Was he a scripted actor preparing a fictional narrative for a traumatized public?
How do you explain these aspects of 9/11 willyloman?
If anything the morons pushing the "no pnaes at WTC" crap are posting from Tel Aviv, helping run cover for deep asset Dov Zakheim and his remote flight SPC planes.
That would be "no planes at WTC" crap.
Tv fakery crowd=useful idiots helping to protect Zakheim and Israels role in 9/11. Oh, but you mention the 5 dancing Israelis right, so I guess that lets you off the hook? No. You're still useful idiots muddying the waters.
Planes hit the Twin Towers. Whether they were Flight 175 and Flight 11, I do not know. Whether they were flown by remote, I do not know. There are jet engines on the streets in Manhattan and thousands of witnesses saw it happen, live. That much I do know. I lived in Manhattan for 7 years. Still have friends there. Friends who saw the second plane hit the South Tower. Whether or not it was actually Flight 175 I have no idea. But there were NOT any jet engines found at the Pentagon and there is NOT any video evidence of a plane striking that building.
Has it EVER occurred to you that if they faked the videos of the planes hitting the Twin Towers, then they would have faked the videos of the planes hitting the Pentagon as well? Ever thought about that? Ever wondered in your little brains why they would risk PRISON for faking one set of videos then not risk PRISON faking another set?
Yes, faking videos can be detected and that makes one an ACCESSORY AFTER THE FACT which in a case like this one wouldn't even be a prison sentence, it would be a death sentence since this is an act of treason and mass murder.
No one is going to fake videos of this, and no one is going to manufacture fake lab results (that's why the simply refuse to test for high explosive residues) because that is a crime in and of itself. Get it?
willyloman only the bottom 5% of intellects still believe in planes on 911, try doing some reaserch man, you've obvioulsy done zero, your insults mean nothing, you can't come here and dis john friend, he's a well respected, dedicated expert on OPERATION 911- media hoax, false flag, psyop, insurance fraud
Anon@8:08, how about you answer his question? Specifically this one-"Has it EVER occurred to you that if they faked the videos of the planes hitting the Twin Towers, then they would have faked the videos of the planes hitting the Pentagon as well?"
Remember cab driver Lloyde England?
He's the guy who supposedly took a lightpole to the windshield.
During his interview, he kept denying that his cab was on the bridge, even when confronted with photos of it sitting there, impaled with the pole.
Thought for years he was the dumbest liar on the planet.
Until one day when a new thought occurred to me: "I think Lloyde got photo shopped!! No wonder he sounds so damn confused. AND so scared."
So no "no planes at the WTC" people wanna answer that question about why they wouldnt have just faked the Pentagon hit if they faked the WTC hits?
Especially when you consider how many people first came to 9/11 truth through the Pentagon and the lack of both damage and footage of the attack. I know I did. It doesnt make much sense to leave that loose end open when it was apparently so easy(according to you no planers) to fake a such a video of planes hitting the WTC.
Or, you know, actual planes remotely flown by ziocon 9/11 perps hit the WTC while something that wouldnt have been shot down by missile batteries in DC airspace "hit" the Pentagon. Sounds about right to me.
@8:33 PM, I'll answer it. First, why do you figure that if they faked one, they would necessarily have to fake the other? If they got people to believe the WTC videos (and after 10 years, it's obvious that they've gotten tens of millions of numbskulls to believe them), why would they need to do the extra work? And if you want to posit that they would HAVE to have faked both, then why aren't you and willyloman asking why they wouldn't have faked a video about "Flight 93?" In any event, both of you are just making assumptions.
And John Friend, as for Harley Guy, his name is Mark Walsh. Here's a link to the full video from that day:
You call it "extra work"? Really, how much extra work is it to cover all bases if faking the videos is so easy? In theory the Pentagon tape should have been even easier to fake as it wasnt live on tv like the towers were.
And talk about making assumptions, its basically what most of the tv fakery theories hinge on.
Your Flight 93 question is a red herring. It stands to reason that NYC and The Pentagon would have lots of cameras around. A desolate field in rural PA? Not so much. And imho the Pentagon issue(and lack of a tape) is a lot more suspicious and led to a lot more people coming into the 9/11 truth fold than did the lack of debris in that field. That was also suspicious but can be explained by a shoot down-which obviously does not automatically lead to "inside job" like the Pentagon issue does.
Oh by the way Anon@2:29, you didn't really answer the question. Unless your weak "extra work" comment was your whole argument for why they wouldn't just fake a Pentagon video like they supposedly faked the WTC videos.
Re faking the footage of the plane hitting the Pentagon: it seems to me it would be much harder to do. I mean, the Pentagon is what, 5 stories high? The entire scenario of a 757 flying in to it is ridiculous. It would be even more obvious that TV fakery was involved on 9/11 if they tried to fake a Boeing 757 hitting the Pentagon...
In any case, like I have always said, there is ZERO evidence that any Boeing 757/767s were involved at any of the sites on 9/11. And there is lots of evidence that the videos we saw in New York were faked. Can anyone still doubting the video fakery angle of 9/11 seriously watch September Clues or read Christopher Holmes' analysis and not be at least skeptical of the video footage we saw that day?
I really need to sit down and do a post on this subject. There are so many angles to 9/11 that are often misinterpreted or simply dismissed...
I don't think we'll ever agree on all aspects of 9/11. I sure hope everyone is on board with WHO did it: Israel and criminal, traitorous Zionist Jews that have control of the United States.
Have you ever considered that September Clues fucked with the footage themselves to fool people into thinking "no planes" were involved so as to discredit 9/11 truth?
I agree, Israel/zionists and their sayanim did the deed. Including Dov Zakheim and his SPC "flight termination system". And as Ive said before, the "no planes" meme lets him, a crucial 9/11 perp, off the hook.
Interesting read John. But im still not convinced and I still think the purpose of "no planes at WTC" is to muddy the waters and let the real perps who controlled those planes off the hook. Dov Zakheim thanks you for playing along.
Plane swaps? Entirely possible, even likely(considering the flight paths of the planes over certain military bases). No planes? Blatant disinfo meant to discredit and confuse.
here is a simple experiment i did with friends at our range.
We cast aluminium projectiles in a 38 calibre mould and fired them from a 357 magnum with a supersonic load at a quarter inch thick steel plate from 25 yards.
The aluminium projectiles failed to penetrate thus proving that the aluminium wingtips of an airplane travelling at subsonic speeds could not have cut thru 14 inch deep steel beams butressed against reinforced concrete floors as 'appeared' to happen on 911 at the world trade centre.
The fact that trained military personel could believe such idiocy highlights the effectiveness of the levels of brainwashing to which americans are subjected.I. sudo apt-get install libmyth-dev svn co -r <package rev> cd mythplugins ./configure --prefix=/usr --disable-all --enable-opengl --enable-mythvideo // my patches to mythvideo make sudo make install Thanks, -- Lindsay MathiesonOther subcategories:

Delivered by FeedBurner low-cost funerals while providing high-quality service. [...] Minnesota refuses to let Verlin build a second funeral home unless
he builds a $30,000 embalming room that he will never use."Minnesota's
law is irrational," said Katelynn McBride, an IJ-MN attorney.
"Embalming is never required just because someone passes away and the
state does not."..."The Minnesota Constitution
protects the right to earn an honest living and this law violates that
right by forcing entrepreneurs to do something time-consuming, expensive
and completely unnecessary," said IJ Senior Attorney Jeff Rowes. "A
victory here will not only free Verlin from an unconstitutional
restraint on his economic liberty, but protect entrepreneurs across the
state from pointless laws and bureaucracy."
Well, they won a similar case, also concerning funerals, in the Sixth Circuit. But it is highly probable that they will lose, based on mainstream jurisprudence.
If they changed the regulation into a universal mandate for embalming insurance, I'm sure some supreme court justices would consider it constitutional.
While I can't speak to the Minnesota constitutional law question, under the law of most states they'd lose (unless the U.S. Supreme Court revives its Lochner v. New York era jurisprudence).
"Constitutional" does not mean "wise", it just means that the state has the power to do it. States generally have broad regulatory authority and discretion to use it stupidly, especially in commercial contexts.
If this was a federal law/issue they would surely lose. The federal gov't has almost unlimited authority under the commerce clause to regulate pretty much all human activity. Economic rights are also reviled by the judicial branch.
I recall when my father died many years ago. We paid far too much for his funeral. Since that time, I've long decided that many funeral homes are a huge rip-off. I'm pleased that Costco sells caskets on their website at reduced prices, but they are still expensive.
Therefore, my wife and I decided we will be cremated at far lesser expense. More and more people are choosing this route.
Throughout America, senseless laws exist just about everywhere. In Minnesota, it seems to me that it's totally inane to require an additional embalming room, especially if it will never be used. I would like the low-cost funeral owner to keep his costs as low as possible. Many people still prefer a formal funeral rite.
I assume they're making a substantive due process challenge, which requires them to show that the law is not rationally related to a legitimate government interest. It's a very, very difficult standard to satisfy. As long as the law arguably serves some legitimate purpose, it will be sustained. The actual intentions that motivated the statute -- e.g., erecting a barrier to low-cost competitors -- are irrelevant; the court will be free to hypothesize purposes on its own. The facts don't matter too much, either, as long as a legislator could conceivably believe them to be true.
That said, due process challenges are sometimes successful. I don't know enough about the funeral business to know whether there's some straight-faced justification one could make for the statute.
They might have a better claim if the statute is unevenly enforced -- i.e., if the state funeral homes police make some homes buy embalming homes but not others.
While I join with the vast majority in disliking this law, I'm not sure that having a court overturn it is a good idea. The power to decide whether a law does something substantively useful (as opposed to creating a cost designed to change the minimum efficient scale in an industry) is not one which judges receive training to exercise well.
"I don't support bad government, I only support good government"
How many cases of government corruption would it take to loosen the statists' faith?
Chances are the state will just 'fix' it by requiring on-site embalming.
"The power to decide whether a law does something substantively useful (as opposed to creating a cost designed to change the minimum efficient scale in an industry) is not one which judges receive training to exercise well." - Telnar
It's not something legislators or voters are trained in either, so why not take advantage of this sporadic opportunity to bludgeon a bad law out of existence?
Kevin,
My concern is that the legitimacy of court decisions invalidating bad laws is a valuable resource and overturning laws which are bad only for substantive reasons risks expending that resource to a degree that invalidating laws which violate more explicit constitutional protections doesn't.UCLA.

A fishing explosive is a Slayer item used for luring mogres out of the water. Mogres are often killed for flippers, but can only be killed after a player has completed the Mogre miniquest. The explosives must be "used" on any of the three "Ominous Fishing Spots" on the peninsula of Mudskipper Point, located south of Port Sarim. Using a Fairy Ring, you can access Mudskipper Point by dialling A•I•Q. The explosives can be bought from any Slayer Master.
After completion of Kennith's Concerns, super fishing explosives can be made, which deal 150 life points when a mogre comes out of the water.
TriviaEdit
- In the book Betrayal at Falador, it is revealed that fishing explosives are pieces of sodium metal contained in oil. Sodium, along with the other Alkali metals, is in fact known for its violent reactions with water.
- Attempting to use a fishing explosive within two squares of an Ominous Fishing Spot causes your player to dubiously state, "If this thing explodes, I think I should stand a liiiiittle further away..."Course Navigator

Planes, trains and automobiles are often cut apart for scraps. They can be cut in many different directions, depending on exactly what it is you're trying to get from them. The same type of concept goes for your body. We can cut it up, metaphorically and realistically, in many different directions. Let's see how we can slice and dice a person and for what important purposes we may sometimes have to do this.
One cut, direction or plane - however you want to term it - is known as the median plane. This is a vertical plane that divides the body into equal right and left halves. Basically, we cut the person in a straight, vertical line from the head through the belly button and down to the toes. The median plane, therefore, creates equal right and left halves of our body.
Any vertical plane that is parallel to the median plane is known as the sagittal plane. With that in mind, it should come as no surprise that sometimes the median plane is referenced as the 'midsagittal plane,' and the sagittal planes are sometimes called 'paramedian' planes, as the prefix 'para' refers to something that's side by side or, in our case, parallel to something else.
You can remember what the median plane is by recalling the fact that a highway median - the barrier or strip of land running down the middle of the highway - divides the highway into right and left halves just like the median plane of our body does.
Another totally different type of cut or plane we can achieve with the body is known as the coronal plane. This is a plane that separates the body into anterior and posterior parts. In essence, this plane intersects the median plane at a 90-degree angle and, therefore, splits the body into front and back halves. This type of division is why the coronal plane is sometimes referred to as the 'frontal plane.'
Hence, it's easy to remember that the frontal plane divides the body into front and, therefore, back parts. Also, the word frontal shares the same two last letters as the word coronal, hence you'll always know they're one and the same..'
The transverse plane can be remembered if you remember it is also the horizontal plane. The word 'horizontal' is the key term here. The horizontal plane runs from side to side (or horizontally); hence, it divides your body into top and bottom halves instead.
Regardless of how you best recall which plane divides the body into which parts, the practical reasons for this terminology sometimes have to do with something called histopathology. This is when we cut tissue up into microscopically thin slices in order to examine the tissue for diagnostic or educational purposes. For example, we may slice and dice a potential tumor to see how invasive it is in the surrounding tissue. Depending on the exact nature of the tissue we are dealing with, we may cut it in different planes to give us a better view of what's going on.
Likewise, we sometimes divide a human being into theoretical slices. Meaning, we don't literally cut up a person; we only theoretically divide the human up. For instance, a CT machine is something that takes many radiographs at once in order to help us form an image that we can virtually slice through in any plane we want in order to help us see what's going on inside of the body. All of these planes, regardless of whether a histopathologist or radiologist uses them, are important to know in order to understand critical reference points in science and medicine.
Now that you know that learning all of those planes is truly important, let's review them so you don't forget them too soon. The median plane is a vertical plane that divides the body into equal right and left halves, and any vertical plane that is parallel to the median plane is known as the sagittal plane.
The coronal plane is a plane that separates the body into anterior and posterior parts and is sometimes known as the 'frontal plane.' Finally, the transverse plane is a plane that divides the body into superior and inferior portions and is sometimes called the 'horizontal plane' asK550's soundstage trumps the other two by a good margin. It's the least fatiguing of the three to listen to. It has the best overall balance. Only gripe I have is the fit. I wish it clamped a little harder so I can get better isolation and better bass presence. So far I like it better than the other two. It really does have the soundstage of an open can. Technically not as crystal clear as the T70 and doesn't have that kick in the bass of the 900's but it possess an even balance which I appreciate. Very comfy also. The isolation is on par with the other two and possibly better if you can achieve the right fit. I listen to just about every kind of music and my collection is on shuffle all the time, so I've heard everything on them so far and find that it works with most genres better than the other two also. I would recommend the K550 over the other two from aesthetics, comfort and sound all together. Another thing to note is that the K550 is not as exciting as the other two. Now, I'm just making this confusing and though. Sorry.
Thank you for the informative reply.
Have you tried bending the head band to increase the clamping force and so the bass too?
Oh, and as I was reading your post I really got excited and I was all set to place an order....that's until I read your last sentence

Killswitch Engage: Jesse Or Howard? [VIDEOS]
They say that smell is the sense with the strongest hooks into memory. Or maybe it isn’t. For some reason I imagine that I’ve heard it said before, but memory is a moving target.
For that same reason, I’m not sure of this next memory, but it is vivid.
It begins with a sound, and that sound is the disembodied voice of Harry Kalas, or John Facenda, like the voice of History itself. The next sound I hear is the music: sweeping strings, blaring horns, unabashedly martial and military in its cadence and themes.
The visuals play at half speed, maybe slower, with the desaturated color palette of a ’60s Super 8mm home movie. Even in slow motion, I can tell that the giant men in uniforms lumber the way people do when they’ve run their body at high speeds into other solid objects, mostly human beings, sometimes the earth, for years and years. Their breaths appear with metronomic rhythm like contrails in what must be bitter cold winter air, giving the impression that they are not people but steam powered machines.
There might not be a sports organization that better mythologizes its past in video than the NFL (play word association with any pro football fan and more often than not, if you say “Lambeau Field,” they’ll come back with “frozen tundra”), but you can judge for yourself today as we’ve partnered with the NFL Network to bring classics from the NFL Films Archive to Hulu.
Whether you’re looking for footage on your favorite team, classic games, specific seasons, or Super Bowls past, the NFL Network on Hulu has it covered. In recent seasons, the NFL has even managed to turn training camp (training camp?!) into gripping entertainment in the form of Hard Knocks.
When I say the NFL has these games covered, I’m underselling it. This isn’t just recycled game footage but reveals angles and shots you’ve never seen before. Watching any of these videos, it’s stunning to realize just how many high speed cameras were planted all over the stadium. It seems like there’s a camera trained on every player and one tracking the football itself.
Being a Chicago boy, the first video I sought out was a profile of the only Bears team in my lifetime to win the Super Bowl, the 1985 Bears of the Super Bowl Shuffle fame. Lo and behold, who should have done the voiceover than an old Hulu friend, Alec Baldwin. It’s as if this partnership was meant to be.

The company is seeing increased profits in key growth segments along with relatively lower than average volume declines in its major smokeable tobacco segment. Altria is also somewhat diversified, with a large 26.8% equity interest in SABMiller (OTCPK:SBMRY). In addition, Altria recently awarded its long-term shareholders with a respectable 9.1% dividend increase, the 47th such increase in the last 44 years. With this increase, Altria now yields slightly under 5.15%.
Q3 2013 Overview
In general, Altria's results came in stronger than expected. Net earnings came in at $1.40B, up over 100% from $657M last year. On a per share basis, earnings came in at $0.70, compared to $0.32 last year. Do note that these results were impacted by certain items. Excluding one-time items, adjusted EPS came in at $0.65, up 12% from $0.58 last year. For the first nine months of 2013, Altria's adjusted EPS was $1.81, up 9% from last year's $1.66.
Altria posted surprising strong revenue growth of nearly 5% to over $6.55B. Gross profits were 13.6% to $2.82B while operating income, which excludes $255M of dividend payments from SABMiller, increased 8.3% to $2.12B.
Below is a table which summarizes Altria's revenues for the quarter:
By far, Altria's most important segment remains smokeable tobacco products, accounting for nearly 90% of revenues at $5.80B. This segment saw revenue growth of 3.4%. However, most of this growth was due to higher pricing, somewhat offset by higher promotional expenses. Cigarette volumes did increase slightly to around 34.1B units, up 1.2% from last year. However, when adjusting for an extra shipping day in the quarter, volumes declined around 3.5%.
Altria's smokeless tobacco products continue to be a key driver of revenue growth for the company. Revenues grew 11% to $485M, compared to $437M last year. Unlike smokeable tobacco, smokeless actually saw higher volumes coupled with higher pricing drive revenue growth. Volumes increased 9.5% overall, with Copenhagen posting over 15% growth. However, adjusting for the extra shipping day, volumes were up only 6.0%.
Altria's wine segment, while small at $148M, still posted solid revenue growth of 5.7%. However, volumes actually declined 2.0% overall. This difference is due to changes in trade inventories and improvements in the premium mix, coupled with higher prices.
While Altria's revenue growth was decent, its operating income by segment grew even faster, as shown below:
Again, smokable tobacco made up the lion share of OCI at $1.83B, or 82% of the total. This would mark an 11.5% increase from last year. However, when adjusted for certain items, this would mark only a 3.1% increase. Much like revenues, this increased profitability came from higher prices, partially offset by lower volumes. Do note that margins did contract this quarter by 60 bps to 41.8%. This breaks a trend for Altria of steadily increasing margins through cost cutting in this segment. Smokeless tobacco also posted impressive OCI of $277M, up 9.1% from last year. The company note that much of this increase came from stronger revenues, offset by higher selling, general and administrative expenses and promotional expenses.
Recent Debt Refinancing to Impact Q4 EPS
On October 28, Altria announced a cash tender offer for a portion of its long-term debt. Basically, Altria is looking to refinance around $2B of its very high yield bonds with newer, lower yielding, debt. Make no mistake, some of the debt Altria is looking to tender carries a yield north of 10%, which is well above what Altria can currently get on the bond market.
As a result of this tender offer, Altria noted that it expects to take a charge of about $1.1B, or $0.35 per share, against Q4 2013 earnings. Altria also revised its guidance for 2013 FY reported EPS from a range of $2.57 to $2.62 to a range of $2.22 to $2.27, which includes the impact of the one-time charge related to the cash tender offer. Do note that Altria 's adjusted FY EPS guidance remains at $2.36 to $2.41.
Altria made a similar move last year to refinancing some of its legacy high yield debt. These is a wise decision by the company as this will eventually lower its quarterly interest expenses and should be accretive to EPS starting in 2014.
Final Thoughts
Compared to some of the other "safe" stocks out there, Altria is hardly expensive, at only a forward PE of 14.50%. For those seeking income, Altria remains a solid choice. Its current 5.15% yield is one of the highest in the S&P 500. Using the midpoint of its adjusted FY 2013 EPS, Altria's payout ratio is only about 81%, inline with its traditional dividend payout target of 80%. This combination of both value and yield makes Altria a strong hold for nearly any investor.

Idiot, I thought. When I got close to the front of the line I could see a TV up in the corner, and there was a picture of the WTC, smoke coming out of one of the higher floors. And people were saying a small plane hit it. Geez. How could that happen?
So, across to the Garden I went. The Rangers were skipping their annual trip to Burlington, Vt., for camp. They were going to have it at MSG and let the fans in for free, sort of an olive branch for all the lousy hockey they had presented since 1997.
They were supposed to be staying at the World Trade Center Marriott, but something happened and that got scuttled, and they wound up in a mid-town hotel. Early that Sept. 11 morning, they were to start trickling in for pre-camp physical exams and testing.
By the time I walked through the employees’ entrance, people were saying it wasn’t a small plane, but a big jet that hit the skyscraper. Still, it was exceptionally odd and worrisome, but there was no idea how bad.
Then, and I don’t remember the order, but it seemed at almost the same time, came word that the Pentagon was hit, and so was the other tower downtown. Holy crap!
All the buildings in New York were now being evacuated. Sirens were screaming, all of them headed south, and you can’t imagine how many of them. Soon there were F-16 fighter jets, deafeningly loud, unbelievably low, zooming across the city skyline. There was fear of what had just happened, and fear that more might be coming? What next? The Empire State Building? Grand Central? The bridges? The Garden?
I started to make my way home, and it would take about 12 hours of walking, jumping cabs and buses and finally making it to the Metro North Station in New Rochelle for a train home. I saw the second tower fall with my own eyes.
Soon after we started to see how intertwined the Rangers were with 9/11. They are, afterall, one of two teams that actually plays in Manhattan. They were the only team in the city that day. And they had the largest number of players and staff actually living in the city. They would play the first post-9/11 sporting events, albeit exhibition games.
Brian Leetch lost a close friend, John Murry (see NHL.com’s story here). Don Maloney lost his brother-in-law Tommy Palazzo (I went to high school with him, and the last time I saw him was at MSG, him telling me about the great view he has from his office at the WTC). The L.A. Kings’ scouting director Ace Bailey and scout Mark Bavis were on the second plane to hit the tower.
What I remember most was how the Rangers reacted, how great Glen Sather and Ron Low were, how the players went on their own to visit firehouses and workers at Ground Zero and — unlike some of our other pro sports teams around here, who seem to think 9/11 was about them, or that the commemoration of the event is a marketing tool — the Rangers never invited the media or the cameras to make the visits with them.
They did everything right, and for the right reasons. For that, I have always — and always will — admire the organization.
I’ll probably have more later on.
I’m just wondering if any of you want to share your memories or thoughts on the worst day of our lives.
Good morning, boneheads!
I was at work, doing my regular morning report with residents. After that, it’s a blur…I stayed in the hospital for more than 48 hours, as did most of the doctors that day. We were all waiting for injured and sick patients to come in. Not a single patient. Not a single darn soul we could’ve helped. They all perished. Mrs says hello to all. I told her what Carp posted. She is crying.
We all lost someone. We need to never forget. And we need to move on. Cherish what you have. Hug your lived ones.
I was at work. My sister called me and told me a plane hit one of the Twin Towers. What?! I couldn’t believe how that could happen. Then she called again and told me another plane hit the other tower. She saw it happen on TV! I’m in disbelief. WTF!!!!!! Then she calls me AGAIN and tells me a plane hit the Pentagon. OK, now I’m scared Carcillo-less. Another call (at which time I don’t want to answer the phone) she says the tower came down. I said, “what do you mean? it came DOWN?” She said I saw it on TV. It’s gone. It collapsed. The rest of the day is a blur… the plane that crashed in Shanksville and the second tower coming down. All flights cancelled. Going home from work? Did I spend the day at the office? I don’t recall. Coming home and watching replays on TV and not even knowing enough curse words to use. Calling my parents just to hear their voices.
9/11 took everything out of my mom. She was never the same person again. She could not believe people could do something like that. She died two years later. She lost the will to live.
Apologies! WTB! above. I got caught up in it just writing about it.
Carp, how did you see the second tower fall? Weren’t you too far uptown? Not that I doubt you. I’m just curious.
I was in FL at the time at work. One of my co-worker’s husband called and said a plane hit the WTC. My first thought was ‘idiot’ that an amateur pilot messed up. A few minutes later her husband called back and said something about the Pentagon but reports were unsure. At that point I ran downstairs to the pizza place that had a television with a few co-workers right behind me. As I ran through the door the very first image I saw was the plane hitting the second tower. It is an image that is forever burned into my mind’s eye.
I was in at Palmer College of Chiropractic and remember going to class that morning and walking in and my buddy Pete who went to Bloomfield College with me for undergrad said a plane had hit the WTC. I remember everyone hanging out in the hallways and in the student lounge watching everything unfold. Classes were cancelled…
Just an awful day.
I was on a treadmill working out when I saw one of news channels comment saying that a small plane had crashed into the WTC, by the picture it was evident that it wasn’t a small plane and it was hardly an accident.
The day was so clear it would have been impossible for it to be any thing other then an act of terrorism,, the second plane confirmed it as did the act at the Pentagon.
As the act progressed and the buildings collapsed , I was so angered at our government for letting this happen.. someone had to know about this.. turns out several people had Osama in their sights but the US underestimated him.
It happened at Pearl harbor 1941 and at The WTC in 93 and 2001 , some day it will happen again..
Marji, I was crossing either Fifth Avenue or Madison, and in mid-town you’re uphill and you can see downtown pretty clearly. And you could see all the smoke, and then I saw the giant cloud mushroom as the second building fell.
ilb, I was talking to somebody the other day who was working in one of the hospitals down there and he said the same thing. Nobody came in. He said he handed out a few band-aids. And waiting. Nobody came.
I was sitting at home in Norway, just gotten back from a walk and had put my son down for a nap. Kind of tired myself I just flopped down on the sofa and switched the channels, can’t remember if it was the Norwegian channels or if it was CNN, but someone was showing horrible picture from New York.
I sat up in shock and stared at the screen as the second tower was hit.
It was so far away in a country on the other side of the world,
in a city I had never been to but it felt so close and so personal.
I cried as I watched the devastation images until I couldn’t take it anymore.
Then I picked up my beautiful baby boy from his crib and let him sleep the rest of his nap in my arms. But the images from New York are forever etched in my brain and are something I’ll never forget.
I was able to visit ground Zero in 2005 with my son, we held hands as we put down flowers and said a little prayer. We’ll never forget 9.11.
I was in my senior year at St Bonavanture University. My only class that day was at 1pm so I was sleeping in. I awoke around 10am to the news on my radio that planes had struck in NY and DC. I couldn’t believe it at first, so I grabbed the remote, turned the tv onto a news station and was instantly stunned at the images. My senior thesis suggestion one sheet had to be turned in that day and I had all plans to type it up before class. I managed to do that, in and around watching the horrifying scenes on tv. It was the worst thing I have ever written.
Upon hearing about the plane in Shanksville, I began to worry. I had no idea where that was, only that it was in PA and that I was currently 20 minutes away from that state. I remember calling my Mom and honestly freaking out about everything over the phone to her. Everything was so up in the air, I started thinking about my family, 5 hours away in Albany and how Albany was NY’s capital and it was mere miles from the Watervliet Arsenal and the GE Nuclear Plant in Schenectady. Looking back, it was absurd to have these thoughts and yet, I had them.
The rest of the day passed in a blur. Students and professors wandered around campus in shock. CNN was playing on the projector in the Murphy Auditorium, it was playing on the big tv in the RC Cafe. The journalism department (I was a J major) was using this as a huge teaching tool, even on that day. Our ROTC department walked around campus in their military uniforms. We had a memorial/prayer service that evening in our chapel and it was packed. Campus priests, the counseling center and campus ministry were open and available to anyone that needed to talk.
In the blink of an eye, our idyllic, beautiful campus tucked away in the Allegheny Moutains turned from worrying about classes and papers and internships to worrying about loved ones and our country at large.
A huge number of students were from the NYC area and we had (and still have) so many alum there. I remember hearing about Fr Judge, a Franciscian and the FDNY Chaplain at the time, a man that many of our priests and brothers on campus knew. I remember not being able to turn off the tv at all that day/night, still unable to process what I was seeing.
Even though I am from upstate, that day made me feel closer to NYC than I had ever been and that has become even more apparent as the years have passed.
This is a first and prob only post but:
Great job Carp
And all other boneheads ur definatly entertaining
But I had to say that on this day those 40 or so people on United 93 are what a hero really is. I will always be proud to be American because of them
I wasn’t expecting to get so emotional this morning. Ha, I don’t know what I was thinking.
This blog has become so much more than what it was originally intended to be.
To all those lost, WE WILL NEVER FORGET.
billy, I’m with you on how emotional this morning has been. I’ve been up since 6am, watching the coverage and it’s struck me in a way that I wasn’t anticipating.
God bless all those whose lives were lost that day.
You were all my age or older when 9/11 happened. I was in 4th grade. I still remember that day but it seems like i only remember it from telling the story to people who asked me where were you on 9/11? It goes like this:
As a young child i didn’t understand why everyone was leaving school early. By 1030AM there were only 3 people left in my 4th grade class. Me and two other innocent children that were extremely angry that we were still in school while everyone else got to go home. I couldn’t understand why? When me and the 2 other kids asked our teacher why everyone was going home, she just didn’t answer. She didn’t teach. She kept leaving the class room. We just sat there. Finally the PE system went on and the voice over the speaker said it was my turn to go home. I was so so so so happy, on a day i should have not been. I was extremely puzzled as to why my mom would be taking me out of school. She never, and when i mean never i mean NEVER, took me out of school early. Unless the nurse called her and said you need to come pick up your child now i would stay in school 6 hours a day. Anyway i packed my things and headed off to the main office, the hallways were empty, the class room were empty. There were 4 hours left of school and the building was quite. I got to the main office to see my mom holding my little brother in her arms who was in 1st grade at the same school and my older cousins standing near by. I walked up to them and my mom grabbed me and hugged me. Im now thinking what is going on, and hoping were going to do something fun since she is also taking my cousin and brother out of school. On the drive home i finally found out what had happened. As a young child i didn’t really know what to think. I remember watching the planes hit the buildings when i got home, but honestly i cant remember what type of emotions i had, perhaps because i didn’t have a distinct emotion. My younger brother then asked me to go play N64, i happily agreed and that took up the better part of my day. I was a child and i only started to understand what really happened in the years following. I learned from seeing first hand the hatred that was formed and the nationalism that was built. I guess it was a sad day for me, but honestly i cant remember.
Loved, not lived, sorry for that typo… Tough to type on iPhone with poor service with your eyes full of tears. And your wife sitting across and crying nonstop. By the way, I was writing my morning post while we were having lunch in small, Arabic village Akko, not far from Haifa. Friendly, hospitable, fun loving people. Smiling. There is very little doubt they have no desire to be associated with any of those events. What went wrong? Most importantly, when is it going to end?
I had visited the WTC only three days prior with some family members…
RIP, everyone.
I was in 7th grade and going to school down in Brooklyn. We had just walked out of music class when everyone was ushered back into our homerooms. I don’t know who told me–the rumors were FLYING. There was a bomb. A plane. The WTC. The Pentagon. The statue of liberty. Once we all settled down, the phone calls tried to go out. Every student with a cell phone called out, unable to reach their parents. Parents who could call called the school to tell their kids they were okay. Babysitters and family showed up in trickles to get their kids home. My best friend was hysterical–her father worked across the street. He made it out okay.
My brother was a sophomore in the same building and couldn’t reach my mom. After some arguments with my homeroom teacher, he pulled me out and we walked across our neighborhood to pick up our younger siblings from elementary school. They asked us what was wrong–we couldn’t tell them. They asked us about mom–we couldn’t tell them. We walked home and did what any other kids would do.
We turned on cartoon network. My younger brother was five–he stayed and watched Bugs Bunny while my brother read the ticker tape and I sat in my room, by the phone, answering phone calls from every member of our family. I could crane my head to look at the skyline from my window and all I remember seeing was smoke. Miles and miles of that thick, black smoke.
Eventually, my mom and her coworker came home. They had evacuated down 40 floors of their building and walked eight miles to get to our house. She was covered in dust. To reach home, they crossed the Brooklyn Bridge. I didn’t see it, but mom told us that people had lined across the bridge with food, and water for the people who walked home that day. And when the Rangers played that exhibition game, we all sat down to watch together.
Carp, thank you for the touching article in today’s paper. I still have a lump in my throat, and reading the story makes me proud of who we are. Thank you.
Wow. Strikethrough typos. That’s new… sorry!
Wanted to say that while I hate that we all seem to have stories, I’m thankful that everyone can share them. Now, I’m off to bake cookies for a local firehouse. Give someone a hug today!
Leine and everyone, thank you for sharing so much of your personal stories. It’s been 10 years and this is still part of the healing process.
RIP Cousin Frank. Prayers for all the victims of and families affected by 9/11.
edd, Caroline Wozniacki is like the female Michael Chang. She tries to return every ball in an effort to tire the opponent. Therefore, it was the strategy of Serena to overpower Wozniacki in an attempt to end points quickly. When Serena overpowers an opponent, it is a decision, a strategy. Despite being in poor form last night because of a *year’s absence from tennis*, it still takes tremendous mechanics to generate the power that she does. A tennis player does not just swing the racket as hard as he/she can when effectively using power. Mechanics are required. There ends today’s lesson. :)
Today is also a day to honor those that have sacrificed their lives over the past decade to prevent anymore terrorism against our country
I was at work in DC a few blocks from the White House. We could see smoke from the Pentagon from the office and I watched the Towers come down on TV. As a New Yorker by birth and being raised there (which I will always be), it felt like the blows were coming from all angles. Little did we know that a plane that would have been headed for the White House and could have easily hit us instead, was taken down by an extraordinary group of American heroes. We also heard rumors of a bomb at the State Department, which turned out not to be true. I count myself truly lucky to have been (and to remain) safe, but the loss was, has been, and remains profound. Carp, thanks for the forum and the well-written articles that clearly come straight from the heart.
I was at my job @ Verizon in Madison NJ that morning. We had no radio reception, no TV, only internet (which as the day went on got incredibly slow). Co-workers that were able to reach people on the phone gave us updates, but some were so contradicting we didn’t know how what was true. Our boss told us to stay at work and tell any customers that we were only taking calls from government or Hospitals . To make a long story short, I left my job at 5pm and as I was traveling home on Rt 287 the highway was completely deserted. When I turned on my tv @ 6pm, that was the first time I saw what had happened.
None of my family or friends were victims (thank goodness) so to this this day I feel weird a bit this tragedy. I did remember that the Rangers were supposed to be staying at the Marriott by ground zero,(I didn’t know until today that they were at another hotel in NYC) but figured they’d be MSG by the time of the attack, so they would be ok.
I don’t know what else to say right now other than, thoughts to the victims and thanks to Carp for his story.
Why is the first part of my post in red?
And sorry for the typos.
I was a snot-nosed, freshman in college when it happened (out in rural in PA after growing up my whole life in NYC) . I wanted to be back in NYC. I was homesick for the few weeks I was there already. It was a culture shock.
I was sleeping that Tuesday morning. My friend Catie, woke me with a text to turn on my TV. I asked why the hell is she waking me up at 10 AM when I don’t have any classes. She said that “something bad happened in NY”. I turned on my TV and I saw the unimaginable happening in my home town. Immediately, I thought of all the folks I knew in Manhattan and my best bud who just started at NYU. When I tried calling them, all I got was a busy signal for hours. Then, the plane came down in PA (not far from school), and I was very nervous and I actually was panicking.
I finally spoke to my Dad by cell phone that afternoon. He immediately told me that this was an act of war and that freedom was being attacked. I still didn’t get it. He told me that Islamic militants have used techniques like this against Israel in the past and that this was probably a terrorist act, not an attack by a nation state. I still didn’t understand. Why would some group be so cowardly and ruthless. I was changed forever.
I never used to think twice about cops, fireman, or military personnel before that day. I was living in a dream world. I was a spoiled kid. I took them for granted. Not anymore… They are the heroes that make America exceptional…the most relevant lesson from 9/11…
I learned what means to be an American. 10 years later I can still say: “Together we stand; divided we fall”. I hope that the message of 9/11 resonates forever. We can’t forget. We mustn’t forget. We will prevail. We have prevailed.
I have a glossy banner abut 11X17 maybe a little bigger in my Ranger Room that must have been handed out either on opening night or maybe a pre season game that year and it says:
We at The New York Rangers send our thoughts and prayers to the families of all injured and lost, New York’s finest and bravest, all volunteers and rescue workers.
Then there is the Rangers Emblem at the bottom. On the other side is the American Flag.
Can’t believe it has been 10 years.
That was probably the weirdest day of my life. I was in the 6th grade, and just showed up for school. We all just sat there and did nothing while the teacher was just looking out the window. It was awesome! No work, being able to talk. I was so happy. Eventually our names got called one by one, as our parents showed up.
I didn’t really know what happened until days later. I guess my family didn’t want me to worry, since my dad was a firefighter. I definitely didn’t understand the purpose of the attacks until years later. Luckily my dad was alright, but he lost a lot of friends, obviously.
Hard to believe it’s been 10 years. Time really does fly!
Anyone know where I can find a video of the Rangers’ first game in the 01-02 season?
Specifically the pregame stuff with the team and the FDNY.
I have the first preseason home game against the Devils and the first regular season home game against Buffalo, with pregame coverage.
every year i watch as much of the 9/11 coverage as i can……i sit glued to the TV…..i have even seen a european cut where many of the “jumpers” were filmed…….it is still shocking and terribly moving……so sad and for what?…..byfuglien azzens……complete pieces of carcillo……
Bwaha! Rapistburger sacked! Weee!
I’m studying these Football games. I want to learn how to play Madden NFL without throwing hail mary’ all the time.
NFL Red Zone link
Why do they call it Football? I don’t get it!!
Throwball
Orr, I can grossly oversimplify for you: Run to set up the pass.
Carp, can you post a link to your newspaper story, please?
Who had Football first, Football Football or Soccer Football?
Was Handball invented before Football?
Why not call it Limbball?
Here it is, ilb. I’m putting it in tonight’s Go Time post, too.
How’s the trip going?
Thanks, Carp. Not sure I can stay late tonight, it’ll be 1 am for Go Time. We are enjoying the trip, moved up North today for a couple of days before driving South to Red Sea. We will finish it with one week stay in Jerusalem. It’s been a long and emotional day for us.
LOL! There’s a St Louis Rams player named C.J. Ah You! Ha!
Thanks for the story, Carp….Goosebumps is right….
Went to church earlier.. the songs during communion were ‘Do Not Be Afraid’, “Let there be Peace on Earth’ and “The Prayer of St Francis’. Needless to say, after watching the coverage this morning, I was a sobbing emotional mess.
VH1 is airing ‘The Concert for NYC’, the one at the Garden in late October of that year, right now through 10p EST, commercial free. I recall watching this when it first aired and being struck at all these muscians and celebrities coming together without the usual complaining and dive-like attititudes. I wonder if something like that could happen today.
Good afternoon, Carp!
Big hug to all the boneheads today. Love you guys.
Good evening all. What Sally said.
Sorry, that’s all I got today.
Afternoon ILB and all!
Carp,
Great job and thanks!
Sally
I agree 100% with your statement
All I have to say is I give my condolences to all those who lost family and friends ten years ago and to all of my friends and brothers who we have lost in ten years of war since then, thank you and I miss you. You are the true heroes (and all who are still serving over there)!!! Thank you all!!
wicky, xoxoxo
and that’s worth a wicky….
I’ll second and third what Sally and wicky said.
We love Sally!
Serena William’s getting woman-handled.
Bye bye, Serena! Go Stosur!T

Im watching!!!! Go Giants
Is it one or two hours? Stupid program guide says it's some other show.
I believe it is 1 hour long. I will be doing a fantasy draft right before watching this.
Love the job the NFL Network does with this series.
I swear watching the SB42 one gives me goosebumps all the time especially when Strahan comments on coach Coughlin.
This one should be equally as memorable.
I am SOO excited for this. It's going to be totally worth the wait.
Does anyone know if this can be streamed online? I don't have cable. The only thing I watch is football and baseball. Baseball online and football in bars. Any help would be appreciated.June 1, 2006

"I have this urge, a compulsion really, to turn the basic idea of a bookstore on its ear,” says Alex Dawson, co-owner and manager of the Raconteur, a used bookshop in Metuchen. The Raconteur not only sells new and used books and organizes screenings of film classics, it also runs a motorcycle club for book-loving bikers. Every summer and fall, the club sets out on a series of motorcycle treks to “sites of literary or cinematic interest.” Previous excursions explored William Carlos Williams’s Paterson, and Blairstown, where Friday the 13th was shot.

A nice café with a rather good bookstore attached
Jeremy Mercer sounds a call to arms to all real book lovers to rally and keep the independent bookseller alive
By Jeremy Mercer
December 8, 2007
THE GUARDIAN
It is incumbent upon us to go to such lengths to help those foolhardy dreamers who still insist on opening bookshops. Just look around: on the Greek island of Santorini where a band of young idealists created Atlantis Books or in the New Jersey town of Metuchen where a bearded maverick opened The Raconteur or in London where Lloyd's of Kew has been lovingly revived complete with tree sculpture bookshelves. If these folks are willing to gamble their meager resources on the absurd adventure of bookselling, the least we, the bookstore faithful, can do is match their bet. It might cost a little more in time and money, but consider it a form of tithe. How else will we preserve our literary sanctuaries?

Look for gobs of literary mayhem this weekend at The Raconteur Festival in Metuchen. We're talking live music from The Roadside Graves and Spain's Sandra Rubio, authors such as Charles Bock (Beautiful Children) and Shelley Jackson, who's building a story with tattooed volunteers--don't ask just show up--and The Bindlestiff Family Cirkus, a traveling combo of vaudeville, burlesque and sideshow. Join the circus (sorry cirkus) at your own risk. Don't say we didn't warn you.

Metuchen does Oscars with book readings

Metuchen had its own Oscar program last Saturday night, a day before the actual Oscars ceremony in Hollywood. The master of ceremonies in Metuchen was not Jon Stewart, the comedian, but Alex Dawson, mid-thirtyish bookseller, playwright, set designer, bartender, motorcycle rider, actor, big tall guy, and a "sine qua non" such as I never "sine qua non" before.

When it comes to the Raconteur bookstore in Metuchen, size matters – and bigger isn’t necessarily better. Patrons can’t grab grande half-caf caramel lattes at the modest Main Street bookstore, tucked between Charming Nails and the Metuchen Savings Bank, but they can rent hard-to-find indie and foreign films, read Hunter Thompson’s obituary, flip through a massive Shakespeare tome perched on a lectern or bump into any number of quirky decorations, including masks from around the globe and a life size Indian statue made of masking tape.

Finding a figure like Pinchbeck in suburban New Jersey might seem something of a surprise, even in Metuchen, a place that considers itself Manhattan hip and goes by “the brainy borough.” But the bookstore has a reputation for transcending its locale.

Short-story book features local authors
Contributors include both professionals and beginners

Besides being an attorney, incoming borough councilman Chris Morrison is also a writer of fiction in his free time. "I had always enjoyed writing, but I had never really shared that with anyone else," Morrison said. "Before this, I hadn't been published in anything besides college publications."
Morrison's work appears in the recently published Raconteur Reader, a collection of 30 short stories published by Alex Dawson, owner of Main Street's three-year-old bookstore, The Raconteur. The book's contributors include a range of writers, from those whose work is being published for the first time to those who are award-winning professional writers, including Oscar-nominated screenwriter Robert Festinger, who co-wrote the screenplay for "In the Bedroom."
Fellow Metuchen resident and author Robert Kaplow is also a contributor to the Reader. Kaplow has seven published novels to his credit, and one of his books, "Me and Orson Welles," is now being made into a film by director Richard Linklater and stars teen actor Zac Efron. Kaplow also refers to himself as an "authentic fan" of the Raconteur bookstore. "I am there all the time … I was there today," he said. "The Raconteur is what a bookstore ought to be”

Tricks, treats at local haunted houses

EDISON - Some Halloweens, it can be just plain torture scaring up something fun to do.
But not this year. Over the weekend Edison and Woodbridge townships each played host to a sprawling haunted house, where thousands were given a good fright. But those unfortunate souls who missed out will still have another chance to experience true terror at Metuchen's Raconteur Bookstore on Main Street, beginning tonight at 7:30 p.m.
"We are doing what we call 'The Haunted Bookshop' for the first time ever, with the monsters inspired by classic horror stories," said storeowner Alex Dawson. "Participants will be given a tour through the store by a freshly murdered Scotland Yard detective, Inspector Lestrade, who was a character from the Sherlock Holmes series."
The windows of the storefront will be blacked out, and the shop's interior will be illuminated by colored lights, Dawson said. "Each aisle will be curtained off, and we will have characters from the 'Phantom of the Opera' and the 'Island of Dr. Moreau,' among others, as well as Edgar Allan Poe reciting his famous poem 'The Raven.'

HATTIESBURG — The University of Southern Mississippi says campus police have arrested a suspect in Sunday’s hit-and-run accident that left one student injured.
The suspect, held Wednesday at the Forrest County Jail, has not been identified. University Police Chief Bob Hopkins says the suspect will be charged with leaving the scene of an accident causing injury.
Bob Hopkins says officers used camera footage from the scene of the accident to help identify the suspect, who was interviewed and arrested on Wednesday morning. He says the suspect is not a USM student.
The accident occurred Sunday around 6 p.m. Hopkins says a white SUV struck a student traveling on a bicycle in a crosswalk near the USM parking garage and Century Park residence hall.
Hopkins says the student’s injuries were not life-threatening.Sony Pictures and Ubisoft Motion Pictures are teaming on a full-length feature film based on the Rabbids, the bad guys from Ubisoft’s Rayman video games that have spawned spinoff TV series, merchandising, comic books and even a theme park attraction in France.

Ubisoft is working with New Regency on developing Splinter Cell starring Tom Hardy, with Fox on Assassin’s Creed starring Michael Fassbender, and again with Sony based on Watch Dogs. Here’s today’s.
Another non-movie for Ubisoft? How re they paying people’s salaries over there?
Had no idea they were part of a video game. My kids think the show is hysterical. They’re like rabbit versions of the “Despicable Me” minions, but more crass.
Meh. Sony had better studio owned IPs in Sly Cooper and Ratchet and Clank. You know, the properties that Sony passed on and are now being produced independently.
