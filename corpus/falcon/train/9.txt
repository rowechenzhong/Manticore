( make sure you take a look at my first attempt from this past september to compare! )
i was pretty psyched to realize how much i love decorating cupcakes. i haven't had a real hobby in a long, long time, and frankly, i don't consider art to be a hobby. cupcake decorating is easily just a hobby, and i'm enjoying it more every time (at least the successful times.) it feels really good to have this in my life.
also, for my jessface's birthday, i made her a "where the wild things are" cake. i had no idea what i was doing, and i fully expected it to be a horrible mess, but i luckily was excited by the outcome. looky looky!
most of all i was excited about carol's hair. i've finally begun exploring with different tips and this one was perfect for hair. it looks so cool! (cooler in person, anyway.) so much exploring and experimenting to be done!!!Hello,

For most of the year, I straddled the line between a working a full-time marketing job and running my business, Creative Advisor Marketing, on the side. It wasn’t until October that year that I decided to break free from the 9-to-5 for good. I switched to full-fledged entrepreneurship with a goal to grow my inbound marketing firm that helps financial advisors communicate their value in a way that grows their pipeline of prospective clients..
Although it wasn’t putting an immediate strain on my business, it was bogging me down and keeping me from being as efficient as possible. I could also see that as I continued to grow, so would the problem. Managing all the back-office tasks would only become harder to handle myself.
I’ll admit it: when it came to accounting, I didn’t really manage it. I had a lot of spreadsheets and manually tracked and invoiced everything. Spreadsheets slowed me down and put me at risk of making big, expensive mistakes because I operated without a backup system.
The problem was mostly internal, but the haphazard, flying-by-the-seat-of-my-pants nature of my accounting sometimes turned into a client-facing problem via inconsistencies and little mistakes that clients could see on an invoice. At times, I feared I looked more like a clueless freelancer than a legitimate business owner.
Knowing my process needed to be more professional if I wanted to grow a sustainable business, I started to seek a more workable, efficient, put-together solution.
As a millennial, choosing to put my accounts on the cloud wasn’t really a tough decision. It was more like a default; every other system I used, personally and professionally, was backed by the cloud. Using the cloud was the most sensible move for my business.
In an accounting solution, I wanted two main things: a low-maintenance system and the ability to produce professionally crafted invoices and proposals or estimates. I already knew, from my manual spreadsheets, how time-consuming and downright painful accounting could be without the right systems in place. Turning a slow, inefficient process into a quick, simple, and smooth one was a requirement.
And of course, creating and sending an invoice was just one part of the accounting I needed to do. Once all those documents were sent, I needed to easily track who paid what and when.
Rapid growth was a good problem to have, but I knew my accounting would suffer if I didn’t make the switch right away. I started using FreshBooks in early 2017—six to seven months after starting my business.
I’m thrilled that FreshBooks has saved me so much time, which frees me up to focus on activities that actively grow my business. Before FreshBooks, I didn’t really give myself the time to do some crucial tasks since I was bogged down in spreadsheets.
I now have the space to do more creative work and business planning, as well as more hours in the day to work on client deliverables and the tasks required to bring in new accounts to the firm.
In FreshBooks, I love having the ability to duplicate invoices, so I don’t have to build everything from scratch. What’s more, I can quickly turn estimates into invoices, which is really powerful and useful—such a time saver!
Using FreshBooks over the last year has helped me manage one important thing: time. With less of it.
Looking into the future, I definitely think FreshBooks will become even more of an important part of my business. I just hired my first team member, so FreshBooks will be there to help me track her time and manage her expenses. I’m looking forward to digging into more of FreshBooks’ capabilities as we continue to expand and grow.
As I see it, here’s the bottom line with FreshBooks and why I would encourage any solopreneur or new entrepreneur to consider it: there’s really no barrier to entry. It’s easy to use and, as a busy small business owner, you don’t need to spend a lot of time learning the software.
Most importantly, as I see my business grow beyond its first year, I’m able to take FreshBooks along for the ride with me.Sunday

It was a HOT HOT HOT week! Well, at least the beginning of it was. Unfortunately it made it too uncomfortable to cook inside. On the bright side, the heat really kicked the garden into gear. The corn is now 7' tall - no tassels yet though. We have squash blossoms, tomatoes on the vines, flowers on the cucumbers, tomatillos eggplants and beans. I'm not so worried now about this coming Friday when we GIVE UP BUYING ALL FOOD. We've also struck a couple of bartering deals with a couple of farmers at the farmers' market. Fruit is going to be a problem for us. We just don't have any yet though we're trying to connect with people who would be willing to barter. Anyone out there in our area want to barter eggs or bread for fruit? :D

Hi Rosa, I stumbled across your blog as I was looking for pictures of hair growth after chemo, and just wanted to say that I am glad to hear that you’re doing well 3 years out! I’m 32 yrs old and was diagnosed in February of 2012, so it’s really helpful to see that life does go on and the hair does (eventually!) grow back. Thanks for the inspiration.
Hi Kirsty!
Thanks for your comment! Be patient,be strong and little by little it will all get better (and the hair longer 😉 ) Rosa xx
I was diagnosed with BC in Sept 2012, i am currently under going chemo and just happened to google “hair re growth after chemo” when I came upon your blog. I to have been blogging it seems to be the only way I can get everything out in the open. I’m 30, mom of 3, never expected this to ever happen to me. It’s comforting to know I’m not alone through this. Your hair is beautiful by the way!
Hi Corey
Thanks for your lovely comment – you are certainly not alone, as unfortunately there are so many of us out there who have had BC. Fortunately, we are together in this! xx
Hi Rosa… I’m so happy to see this post and that you’re doing well and look great. Definitely helps me while going through all this cancer crap! And I understand all the fear stuff, of course. Hopefully that gets better with time. In the meantime, glad to see you’re enjoying your guy and your pup 🙂 xo Steph
Hello Steph! lovely to hear back from you! In my case the fear comes and goes. Problem is that I had bone pain and I instanly thought “cancer!!”. It wasn´t. I just have a very bad back…hope you are keeping your spirits up! xx
Hi Rosa
I just want to leave a quick message to say that your blog is the first blog that I have read ( believe me i have read quite a few!) that i can truly relate to with regards to thoughts and experience and weirdly the dream about hair! Frankly it is a breath of fresh air!
Because in August last year at 31! my life was annoyingly interrupted by BC and i am now nearing the end of chemo (23/1/13) your blog was the perfect end to this journey and has lifted my spirits. I am looking forward to watching my hair grow, to being May again soon and not a cancer patient.
Much love May xxx
Oh May (I love your name by the way, one of my favourite names of all times), I really feel flattered by your comment. Thanks so much!
So good to hear the end of chemo is on sight for you! you have spring to look forward to and a head full of hear.
Be patiend. Be strong! even if it is sometimes impossible…
Love

Hi There!
I have two more rounds of chemo left and have been googling ‘hair growth after chemo’. It brought me to your site and I have to say, the pictures of your progress and the reports on your health today are very inspiring. Thank you for being public about your journey and for sharing it with people like me 🙂
Take care and God bless.

Hi Kathy!
I hesitated at first about “going public” but have never regreted it, seeing how much it has helped other women. All the best for 2014 xxx
Hi Rosa,
Your blog is inspiring! It’s the only one I’ve read. I had just turned 37 when I was diagnosed in Feb this year. Had op, finished chemo 5 weeks ago and am currently having radiotherapy. It’s comforting (and so familiar) to read your blog when you were going through it, and to see you now 3 years on doing so well. I just can’t wait to finish treatment, get my hair back and feel human again 🙂 thank you for sharing your story and reminding us that we will get there!!

on tuesday, the college paper went "where is our penguin", and was flooded with concerned letters from passionate students concerned about the theft of a school symbol. the penguin was promptly returned after realising how much it meant to the community, and to be fair to the school community, no one was charged for penguin theft because they all knew it was just for fun. you see, we can all do with a bit of disruption, no? it's fun.
they didn't display the penguin again though, because it really says "steal me" on its forehead, so i think they put it away in some collection now where it'll be safe from the prying hands.

This virus belongs to the Trojans, family Trojan.Winlock (hereinafter - Winlock). When you try to open Task Manager to kill the harmful process, he started, most likely, will not. More precisely, will start and immediately disappear, as it is also blocked by the virus. This is the "light" form of a boot virus.
For a start, try booting into Safe Mode. (Hold F8 before booting the system, the pop-up menu, select "Safe Mode"). If in safe mode everything is clean, treated such a virus is quite simple. Need to open the System Configuration Utility ( Start\Run, in the window that opens write msconfig and press enter). Then go to the tab " Startup " carefully examine the list. If you see something suspicious ( abracadabra in the name of an element or a strange entry in the column "team"), simply turn off this entry from startup, reboot the machine and everything is in order.
If you do not see anything strange, just turn off all the time startup and reboot. If everything is clean, it means that the virus is run from there. Then just turn gradually record and look after activation of the virus appears. Once you find harmful entry and disable it, you can go to the path specified in the " command ", and remove the malicious file (s), they will most likely be a few.
If you can not go to any safe mode or open the system settings - go through Safe Mode with Command Prompt. Currently, most Winlock can not block it. After downloading you need to run the registry editor and track suspicious entries there. First you need to check the section HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon, specifically in the parameter value should be stored Shell explorer.exe, parameter Userinit - C:\WINDOWS\System32\userinit.exe, namely with a comma. If this section is nothing suspicious there is no need to check under HKEY_CURRENT_USER. Also worth checking out branches where prescribed auto-start programs, for example, HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run. In case of presence records of suspicious, they must be replaced by a standard value (in the case of the auto-clear). After restarting the computer will only remove the malware.
However, it happens that we do not have access even to the boot menu Windows. Such viruses are called " bootkits ". They enter themselves in the MBR (Master Boot Record, Master Boot Record) and run from there, completely or partially displacing boot Windows. This second type of boot sector viruses. To deal with them is also quite simple. Requires installation disk Windows. On the screen where it says " Press R to start the Recovery Console " press. Follow the entrance to your dial up system and one for the other team fixmbr (warning appears, answer yes) and fixboot (also answered in the affirmative), and you're done. Restored the boot record, you can run the system.
If absolutely nothing works, it is necessary to demolish the system, be sure to format the system (system only) section. A virus that has not happened, use anti-virus software and wary of downloadable documents. In no case should not have an extension. Exe.

I!!!Sin makes its own hell, and goodness its own heaven. ~Mary Baker Eddy
ditto- Hats off to LE, FBI, reporters, everyone involved- bet they are wore out to the core- mentally and physically.
For LE
I totally agree, and these guys have my thanks & respect for a job well done!
I send my thoughts and prayers to Yuri Melich, John Allen, everyone at OCSO, and the FBI who are dealing with finding Caylee this week. I know they are relieved to know she is no longer out in the elements and they are taking that last step to obtaining justice for our Caylee.
It has been a heartwrenching and difficult few days. They know all the details of her condition and their nightmares have only begun. They have their nose to the grindstone making certain now to garner every shred of evidence left to finish the case. They needed to find the missing piece to this horrific puzzle which was Caylee. They are putting it all together methodically and will do a great job to insure the person or persons responsible end up with the punishment the jury sees fit to give them. Justice for Caylee is their reward..
God bless them allOUR CHLDREN ARE OUR FUTURE, TEACH THEM WELL AND LET THEM LEAD THE WAY
I love them all and thanks to all of them. Never stop what you are doing.
Love all of you. Bless you and thanks.
They've done a fabulous job, and very professional."There are only two ways to live your life. One is as though nothing is a miracle. The other is as though everything is a miracle."

To everybody- law enforcement, civilians, search volunteers, everybody involved in this investigation and in resolving this case, I say a huge thank you. I know how hard your work is. I know you can't leave it at the door when you go home no matter how hard you try. You will all be in my prayers for inner peace and gentle natures to return, to warm your personal lives with lots of love.
Again, thank you. A job well done.
They all looked great sitting in court for that "emergency" hearing of JB's. These guys are top notch. I am so glad that the body was found. I never stopped praying for that as the one missing piece they truly needed to get a conviction in this case.
God Bless them all!! The citizens of Orange County can sleep better knowing men and women who care are on the job there!!"Curiosity killed the cat, but for a while I was a suspect" Steven Wright
Thank you all for your hard work and dedication to this case. I feel you went above and beyond the call to bring justice to little Caylee. God bless you all.I think about you constantly, whether it's with my mind or my heart. ~Albany Bach Reid
Yuri & ENTIRE LE team,
Thank you for never giving up and for your patience in dealing with this family that chose to help Casey instead of precious Caylee. She deserved so much better.
Amen!
The rice is already cooked...

The days since I went go-karting seemed to have started and ended with me always in a rush to get work done, to meet deadlines, to get to paddling on time, etc, etc. Rushing. That's a perfect way to describe the last month.
What have I been up to since my go-karting evening...
- Ed and I attended Paul and Teresa's wedding (wonderful celebration!)
- We went camping at Green Lake - actually cabin-ing is a more appropriate description
- We went to Vernon with our DB team for the Vernon DB Festival
- I went to Vernon (again) with the FCRCC Outrigger team to compete in the 45km Fresh Water Challenge
- I volunteered to be a timer for the novice and womens races during the Outrigger Nationals in Kits
- Ed and I went to Calgary with Without Warning to compete in the Club Crew qualifiers
- And in between all the paddling and road trips, I worked and worked and worked.
Yes, it's been a busy summer. Regrettably, I have not been in touch with family and friends much. But with my paddling season winding down, there will definitely be more time for that.
I'm looking forward to a lazy weekend where I can just sit at home and hang out with Ed and our cats. I'm crossing my fingers that weekend will come soon...23-05-2013

So... you're having some bother sending a text message? But can receive them without a bother? Then something just ain't right!
First thing would be, have you bought your membership? You've topped up you're saying? That's not always enough. You'll need to convert that to membership so have a look here for more info on that.
So if you've already bought your membership then it has to be something else.
Next thing to do would be to try and check your message centre number - it should be +353894300000 for 48. (And it's really important that it starts +353 and not 00353)
Now where do you check it you might be asking? It's different for every handset. Normally, it's in the Message menu and you'll be looking for "Message Centre Number" - sometimes shortened to SMSC! If you're really stuck Google it!
And if your message centre number is right, you'll need to get in touch with us care crew agents here.Ebooks Life

The Problem of Structure
What would the constitution of a free nation look like? In trying to answer that question we immediately think in terms of a Bill of Rights, restrictions on governmental power, and so forth. And any constitution worth having would certainly include those things. But if a constitution is to be more than a wish list, it must also specify the political structure necessary to ensure that these freedoms are not eroded or ignored. Consider the old Soviet Constitution, which guaranteed all sorts of fine-sounding freedoms for its citizens -- but which in practice proved only an empty promise, since its interpretation and enforcement lay in the hands of an unfettered monolithic centralized state.
Framing a constitution is an exercise in public-choice economics; politicians react to incentives, and so the political incentive structure must be designed in such a way that those in authority cannot profit by the aggrandizement of state power.
Such was the intent of the Framers of the U.S. Constitution when they established the Federal system. Each branch of government was expected to be jealous of the others, and so to be motivated to serve as a check on their expansion. At the same time, the broad base of representation was expected to ensure that no special interest could succeed in manipulating the government.
As we have since learned all too well, the experiment eventually proved to be a failure. Madison and his colleagues could not foresee the logrolling process whereby government branches and special interests ("factions") that were intended to hold one another in perpetual check instead made concessions to one another's ambitions in exchange for like concessions to their own.
Yet some foresaw the danger; one Anti-Federalist poet, bemoaning the recent ratification of the Constitution, wrote:
In five short years, of freedom weary grown,
We quit our plain republics for a throne;
Congress and President full proof shall bring
A mere disguise for Parliament and King.
Thus did the streamlined confederation become the swollen imperial Leviathan.
Decentralize!
Thomas Jefferson wrote many stirring passages about the natural rights of man. But when asked to summarize his political philosophy, he replied that he could state it in one sentence: "Divide the counties into wards.
" In other words: decentralize, decentralize, decentralize!
There are many advantages to political decentralization as a structural limitation on government power. Imagine a country the size of the United States, but consisting of only five states. Now imagine the same region containing 500 states. All other things being equal, the second situation is likely to be much more hospitable to freedom than the first. The smaller the political unit, the greater the influence an individual citizen can have in politics, thus decreasing the lobbying advantage that concentrated special interests have over the diffuse general public. Further, as the number of available alternative political jurisdictions increases, the citizen's exit option becomes more powerful. The freedom to leave one state is small comfort if there are only a handful of others nearby to go to; but with many states, the odds of finding a satisfactory destination are much better.
In addition, competition between states can serve as a check on state power, since if any state becomes too oppressive its citizens can vote with their feet. Also, decentralization softens the impact of government mistakes. If a single centralized government decides to implement some ill-conceived plan, everybody has to suffer. But with many states implementing different policies, a bad policy can be escaped, while a good policy can be imitated. (Here too, competition can serve as a discovery process.) The Federal structure of the United States, imperfect though it is, may well explain why this country has not plunged as rapidly into socialism as its European counterparts -- individual states having free entry while most European countries do not. (Fifty states is certainly better than one -- though still a far cry from Jefferson's notion that six square miles was the optimum size for a basic political unit within a republic.) And Switzerland's even more decentralized canto! n sy stem has doubtless played a similar role in the preservation of Swiss freedom. (Frances Kendall and Leon Louw's book After Apartheid has helped to bring to the libertarian community's attention the usefulness of a canton-style system to countries torn by ethnic strife; but its appeal is not limited to such cases.)
Housetrailers and Empty Landscapes
The constitution of a free nation, then, should most likely be characterized by a radically decentralized power structure, along the lines of some sort of canton system. But can the Swiss model be improved on? I think so.
The effectiveness of competition among political jurisdictions is inversely proportional to the costs of changing one's jurisdiction. Massachusetts faces serious competition from New Hampshire, but little from Alaska, since the costs of voting with one's feet are so much higher in the second case. (The same is true at the international level; there's no mystery as to why Cuban and Haitian refugees are trying to get into Miami rather than into Geneva.) And even when the alternative jurisdiction is nearby, the costs of switching are not exactly low. Uprooting oneself and perhaps one's family in order to move to another state can be costly, both financially and emotionally.
The high cost of switching results from the fact that political jurisdictions correspond to geographical regions, and geographical relocation is not always feasible. Yet a decentralised system serves as a more effective check on the growth of state power to the extent that switching costs are low. Therefore, it seems desirable to decouple political jurisdiction from geographical location.
David Friedman offers an example: "Consider our world as it would be if the costs correspodents." (Machinery of Freedom, 2nd ed., p. 123.)
If people could switch political jurisdictions without switching location, we would have the functional equivalent of the situation Friedman envisions. Competition among jurisdictions would be higher, and the amount of state interference that people would tolerate without switching would be lower, than in a political system where jurisdiction and geographic location are linked.
The Case of Iceland
There are a number of historical precedents for this idea. To pick one famous example, the Icelandic Free Commonwealth (930-1262) operated on the Thing system. A "Thing" was a court or assembly. (The English word "thing" originally had this meaning also; when Hamlet says "The play's the thing wherein I'll catch the conscience of the King," the pun is successful because in Shakespeare's time the word "thing" had begun to have its modern meaning, but also still retained the earlier flavor of a judicial proceeding to establish guilt or innocence.) The national legislative assembly, with its attendant national judiciary, was called the All-Thing; beneath it were four Quarter-Things, corresponding to the four geographical regions of Iceland. But here the tie between geography and jurisdiction ended.
Under each Quarter-Thing were three or four Varthings, and assigned to each of these were three Things. Residents of a Quarter were free to choose membership in any of the nine or twelve Things attached (through the Varthings) to their Quarter-Thing. Membership in a Thing determined who your Godhi or chieftain was; a Godhi protected his Thingmen against local threats, appointed judges from his Thing to serve on the judiciary, and represented his Thingmen in the national legislature. In return, a Godhi's Thingmen paid him fees and did him various favors. One could officially switch one's membership from one Thing to another simply by making the appropriate announcement in front of witnesses. Since the cost of transferring one's allegiance to another Godhi was far smaller than it would have been if the Things had been purely territorial entities, competition put a brake on the ability of any Godhi to oppress his Thingmen too severely or to demand excessive favors or tribute. ! This decentralized system appears to have been quite effective. The Icelandic Free Commonwealth did eventually succumb to centralization, but it took three hundred years; the United States took much less.
(For more information on the Icelandic system, see Jesse Byock's Medieval Iceland, William Miller's Bloodtaking and Peacemaking, and David Friedman's "Private Creation and Enforcement of Law: A Historical Case" (Journal of Legal Studies 8, 1979). For a historical survey of similar systems, see Bruce Benson's Enterprise of Law, and bibliographic essays by Tom Bell and Albert Loan in Humane Studies Review 7, no. 1 (1991/92).)
Virtual Cantons
The Icelandic case has been a popular model among libertarian defenders of market anarchism. But it's important to see that it offers valuable lessons to framers of governments as well. Within the framework of a state, the divorce of jurisdiction from geography is not an option at the national level; but it remains a very live option at the local level. Just as a nation may be divided into many small geographically distinct cantons for purposes of local government and national representation, so it might also be divided into analogous political units that had no territorial significance. These might be called "virtual cantons."
Two Functions of Virtual Cantons
Like the Icelandic Things, the virtual cantons would have two functions: representation at the national level, and government at the local level (with "local" now serving as a structural rather than a geographical concept).
In the first case, each virtual canton would send a representative to the national legislature. Citizens would be free to switch their allegiance to another canton whenever they chose, without having to change their residence; so it would be like being able to live in New York and yet choose a Senator from Arizona as one's representative. Also advisable would be a constitutional provision allowing any group of citizens above a certain size to form a new canton. (The lack of this crucial feature proved to be a fatal flaw in the Icelandic system: since Godhordh, or seats on the legislature, were marketable commodities, it eventually became possible for a small number of families (who had acquired their wealth by being recipients of tithe taxes, which, unlike Godhi fees, divorced income from accountability -- a result of Iceland's forcible conversion to Christianity) to buy up these Godhordh and monopolize the legislature. The Icelandic constitution had no provision for the cr! eation of new Godhordh to counteract this threat.)
On the "local" level, each virtual canton would pass its own laws and provide its own enforcement. Citizens would be subject to the laws of the national legislature and to those of their own canton, but not to those of other cantons. A principal job of the national government would be to regulate relationships among cantons, laying down guidelines for the adjudication of disputes among members of different cantons, resolving conflicts between laws of different cantons, and so forth. But within that nationally-determined framework, there would be free competition among virtual cantons.
Such competition would have many benefits. The threat of losing "customers" would push taxes and wasteful spending far below their current monopoly levels. The presence of alternatives would also lower the incidence of government oppression by linking revenue with accountability. (Imagine, for example, how quickly the LAPD would have lost paying customers after the Rodney King beating if rival law enforcement agencies in the same area had been competing for public support.)
A virtual-canton system is also more fair than a purely majoritarian system. Under majority rule, if 51% of the population favors law X and 49% favors law Y, then law X is imposed on everyone, including the dissenting minority. In short, majority rule creates negative externalities for minorities. A system of virtual cantons would help to internalize these externalities: the minority opposed to law X need not be subjected to it, but may instead join a virtual canton offering law Y. Those in the majority cannot conscript the minority into supporting their projects (or vice versa), but must bear the full costs themselves.
Virtual cantons also provide a better check against local tyranny than do other decentralized systems. In a territorial system, those in a given geographical region may find voting with their feet prohibitively costly, and so must suffer whatever the local government decides to impose; the option to change cantons without changing residency offers the functional equivalent of voting with one's feet, at a far cheaper rate. In general, virtual cantons would provide far more effective checks and balances than those among the three branches of government in the Federal system, because of the competitive potentialities (to which the Federal system has no analogue) of switching between cantons or creating new ones.
The virtual canton system also solves information problems: would cantons tend to divide at all along geographical boundaries, or not? would they vary greatly in size? how many would there be? Competition would allow the market to determine the optimal answers to meet citizens' needs.
National Government
The national government has a vital role to play in providing coordination among the policies of the various cantons. Yet it must be severely restricted in its powers, or the whole purpose of decentralization will be defeated. If the national government, rather than the cantons, becomes the chief locus of decision-making, then the competition among jurisdictions will become otiose, and the cantons will degenerate into special interest blocs vying for centralized power. Hence national powers must be more severely constrained (not just by a written wish list, but structurally) than canton powers, in order to force most political disputes down to the canton level (and thus onto the competitive market).
There are a number of ways of doing this: severe term limits, supermajority requirements, a plural executive, etc. One promising suggestion, offered by Robert Heinlein in his novel The Moon is A Harsh Mistress, would be a bicameral legislature: one house requiring a two-thirds vote to pass laws, the other a one-third vote to repeal laws. It might be especially useful to compose the former of canton representatives (thus ensuring maximum participation of various interest groups in the legislative process) and the latter of popularly elected representatives (thus accommodating Isabel Paterson's principle, in God of the Machine, that any stable political regime must provide an official conduit for the masses to exercise a veto power). A weak central power and thriving virtual cantons could combine the best of anarchy and limited government.Thursday, May 29, 2008

Thought I’d share a few of the whole grain dishes we’ve been eating lately. It’s always so fun to get the new grain & bean share, and to make old favorites as well as some new ones. We recently started carrying Ancient Grains for Modern Meals at the bakery, and we made the super-delicious Lamb with Spelt Berries dish. Everyone in our family loved this sweet, flavorful dish. I really love this book and am excited to make more from it.
We’ve also made Heidi Swanson‘s Baked Oatmeal our official Sunday morning breakfast (beloved even by someone in our house who previously refused to eat oatmeal). The recipe is on her Amazon page there, so it’s easy to find and try! (I do find that it takes longer to cook than she says, and for our fresh oats, you need less liquid.)
I’ll have to seek out that book since I’m always ready for more recipes to try. A friend recently passed this recipe () on to me and I substituted some of the emmer/farro from the share in place of the brown rice. It came out fantastic and is a really “stick to your ribs” side dish. My friend even uses the leftovers as breakfast.
We’ve been using our beans a great deal in bean soups (black bean, three bean, red kidney bean and farro) and I’m planning to try doing more meatless meal nights with bean/rice combos too.
I’m so not a fan of rolled oat type oatmeal but using the whole oats with the overnight crockpot method you’d posted before, I’m in love. We switch out the liquid (almond milk, oat milk, hazelnut milk, apple cider, etc.) and it becomes an endlessly wonderful breakfast choice. I’ve done the porridge too with wheat berries and spelt but I love it best with the oats.
I have so much fun finding and trying new different recipes with all the different grains/beans. I often share small amounts of the grains/beans with family along with a recipe to use them so they can see how lovely and fresh locally grown grains and beans can be.OUCH!
The arrow hit its mark and wedged in deep. Pain shot up my leg. In waves, one after the other. Surprisingly, there wasn’t any blood except a couple of drops. So that was good…
Still.

Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns. I repeated this to myself under my breathe lest I forget as I began my search. Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns.
And so, I started my search.
I looked high and low. I looked far and wide. I looked up and down. I looked everywhere. I looked at the last possible place and then I looked at some more possible places.
But there was no blue flower with red thorns to be found anywhere. Anywhere at all!

October 24 is UN Day and to mark the occasion Vientiane Times arranged an interview with the United Nation Resident Coordinator in the Lao PDR, Ms Kaarina Immonen.
Q: The UN does many things in the Lao PDR, but in your opinion what are its main functions here?
A: The main function of the United Nations in Lao PDR is to support the Government in achieving its national development targets.
Our priority areas of work covers, among other things, sustainable and equitable growth, gender equality, improving the delivery of public services such as access to quality education and health services, improving food and nutrition security, promoting sustainable natural resources management and reducing the impact of unexploded ordnance (UXO). This sounds like a lot but there are 25 different UN agencies currently operating in the Lao PDR, with each agency specializing in different development issues.
While working closely on the national agenda, we promote Lao PDR's participation in the global efforts. Since 2000, we have been supporting Lao PDR to achieve the internationally agreed Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), and more recently to contribute to the post-2015 agenda, where it will be important for the voice of the Lao people to be heard and taken into consideration in shaping the next set of global development goals.
Q: How does the UN support the Lao Government to achieve its development targets in various sectors in the country?
A: We help the Government make informed decisions about their development priorities by providing policy advice and technical assistance. For example, we support various studies, analytical research and data collection efforts, such as population and housing censuses.
In addition, we promote regular consultations between the Government, international donors and development partners in key development issues. The UN is also currently supporting the Government in the design of its next 5-year National Socio-Economic Development Plan (8th NSEDP), which will provide key guidance for the country in moving towards the graduation from the Least Developed Country status.
We also facilitate and encourage South-South cooperation, utilising the know-how of the neighbouring ASEAN countries.
Q: Could you tell me a little about the work of the UN in contributing to help Lao PDR move forward and meet the MDGs?
A: Many of the development issues that Lao PDR faces are interlinked. For example, food- and nutrition security is a huge challenge and one of the most seriously off-track MDG targets. Our direct interventions in this area include providing nutritional supplements to undernourished children and working with farmers to diversify their sources of income, but we also try to address the underlying issues that contribute to the overall food insecurity in the country.
A concrete example of this work can be seen in flood-prone Xayaboury Province, were we have helped communities to adapt to the changing climate by developing water reservoirs to store excess water in rainy season to be used for crops in the dry season. This enables people to grow crops throughout the year, resulting in improved food security for the community.
There are many similar examples of how we work with communities and the Government to bring about real, positive change for people. Another example is the presence of UXO in Lao PDR, which limits development in large parts of the country. The areas with highest UXO contamination are also some of the poorest in Laos, therefore accelerating the clearance efforts is essential part of poverty reduction. At the moment we are working with the authorities and donor partners to make the clearance more efficient by prioritizing the most contaminated areas rather than measure success by the surface area cleared.
Success is really a team effort, and none of this could happen without the work and support of the Lao Government and partners.
Q: Could you rate which MDGs Lao PDR has made a good progress in and which MDGs have made slow progress and why?
A: Lao PDR has made significant progress towards improving the well-being and living standards of many poor communities in the country since the adoption of the Millennium Declaration. The MDGs consist of several different targets and Lao PDR is on track to achieve some of them by the 2015 deadline, but others will take longer to be realised. Lao PDR has made good progress with the expansion of basic health and education services, the strengthening of rural infrastructure and achieving substantial reduction in poverty, which has dropped by over 40% since the early 1990s.
However, high rates of malnutrition with around 44% of under-5s stunted, high rates of infant and maternal mortality as well as shortfalls in UXO clearance continue to keep several of the MDGs in Lao PDR off-track.
There are various reasons as to why the progress has been slow in some sectors. For example, the approach previously applied to address nutrition has been recently revised. Rather than being seen as an issue belonging just to the health sector, it is now been recognized as an issue that needs the involvement of several different sectors and an integrated approach.
Also, while the economy of the country has been growing at a remarkable rate in the past two decades, the sustainability of the growth has not been given sufficient attention. The social-economic benefits of the growth need to support poverty reduction, food and nutrition security and improved education and health services, particularly for those living in remote areas.
Q: What are the some of the challenges for the UN working in the Lao PDR?
A: Reaching out to the various communities is a big challenge because the infrastructure is still poor in many parts of the country and getting services to the most vulnerable is often very difficult.
Given their dispensable role played in enhancing services delivery and achieving development goals, we recognize the need for increased space for the civil society and greater participation by grassroots actors. It is an area where the progress has been slower than we have hoped for.
We work closely with our partners and the majority of our budget (around 60 million USD in 2013) comes from donor countries. Budgets continue to shrink so we have to be increasingly agile in using these scarce resources while demonstrating high quality results for everyone.
Q: In your point of view, what can the Lao Government and the UN keep working on together to help Lao PDR remove itself from the list of least developing countries by 2020?
A: Graduating from the Least Developed Country (LDC) status is an admirable goal for the country and the Government has been very ambitious in setting itself this goal. While it is first and foremost a task for the Government, we are here to support these efforts.
For the Government to realise this goal, a broad vision is required. The LDC graduation should not be an end in itself: it will not only require growth in GDP but also a greater focus on the quality and equity of that growth.Get A Payday Loan in Middle Island, New York

From Navigators
Miguel Falé (advised by Nuno Ferreira Neves, Ibéria Medeiros)
Master’s thesis, Mestrado em Informática, Departamento de Informática, Faculdade de Ciências da Universidade de Lisboa, Dec. 2017
Abstract: For over two decades, the web has been evolving from a simple set of hypermedia documents to a complex ecosystem of web applications that are supported by various frameworks. This paradigm shift has been promoting a series of practices that lead to an increasing number of vulnerabilities, which can compromise the security of web applications. One of the main contributing factors lies in vulnerable source code, written in unsafe languages such as PHP. In order to mitigate the problem, a large research effort on web application security has occurred over the past years. Source code static analysis tools perform the task of finding program vulnerabilities in an automated fashion. These tools offer superior code coverage, easier integration into the application development cycle, and do not require the actual code to be executed. They instead perform source code analysis, looking for potential bugs while inspecting the program code. However, the analysis performed by these tools depends on their knowledge of the classes of vulnerabilities and the implementation of analysis techniques, such as taint analysis. This means that, on one hand, the tools only search for vulnerabilities in the source code that they hold knowledge of, being unable to find other kinds of problems. On the other hand, the tools may generate false positives and false negatives, due to the limitations and incompleteness of implemented analysis techniques. One of such tools is the Web Application Protection (WAP). The main objective of this dissertation is to identify problems with WAP and improve its vulnerability detection capabilities, when processing open source PHP code. Four static analysis tools - WAP, Pixy, phpSAFE and RIPS - are evaluated against a set of WordPress plugins that are known to be vulnerable, in order to collect examples of incorrect processing of the tools which lead, for instance, to false negatives. Additionally, we define and evaluate several use cases for a common found limitation, which consists in the identification and circumvention of circular dependencies (i.e., recursive inclusion of code) in the source code. If circular dependencies are not treated correctly, they may lead to unexpected tool behaviors and incorrect analyses. These assessments help reflecting upon new solutions to address WAP’s shortcomings. A new version of WAP is implemented, and evaluated with the same original WordPress plugins. This dissertation offers the following contributions. A list of vulnerabilities is compiled through manual analysis of the plugins, in a format that allows comparison between the chosen tools, and the identification of common false negatives. An enhanced version of WAP is implemented, with improved detection capabilities that reduce both false positives and false negatives. Two evaluations concerning WAP and a set of WordPress plugins are present, comparing the results before and after the enhancements, respectively.

Like every politico, I do love a good Lib Dem leaflet. They never fail to disappoint, and their most recent one is no exception.
I got the "Edinburgh North & Leith Liberal Democrats Resident's Survey" through my door the other night. (Un)fortunately I was out training when their Westminster candidate, Kevin Lang, delivered the leaflet himself.
I do note that, despite the mess of Edinburgh's streets at the moment as a result of a dispute between the unions and the Lib Dem-led Edinburgh Council, there is no question on the survey regarding refuse collection.
However, I digress. It is a cracking effort at a textbook Lib Dem leaflet though. Rogue capitals, a couple of candidates featured that aren't standing in your area and, inevitably, the dodgy bar chart. Let's look at the graph, shall we?
Mmmhmm. I see what we're looking at here. 2005 UK General Election result in Edinburgh North and Leith (with slightly skewed positions on the chart I think). I guess that's a fair comparison - same boundary, same-ish population. But 4 years ago? Surely there are some more recent numbers we can look at?
Ah yes, the 2007 Scottish Parliament Election. We're working with a fairly similar boundary here (with a couple of minor changes) and obviously electing to a different parliament, but you'd expect that would give a decent barometer of support for different parties in the constituency. This was the result:
Labour 35%
Lib Dem 27%
SNP 25%
Con 13%
I see why we're not using that result - the Lib Dems have dropped a couple of points from the UK election result while the SNP more than doubled their vote share in, granted, what was an exceptional election for them.
But what's that you say? There was another election in Edinburgh North and Leith this year? Just 2 months ago? Oh yes, the European Parliament election. I seem to remember George Lyon's leaflet telling me that "Only the Lib Dems could win here," despite the whole of Scotland being a single constituency for that election! Anyway, the results in Edinburgh were broken down by constituency, so we know the result in North & Leith. And here it is:
SNP (4965) 20.5%
Labour (4324) 17.9%
Lib Dem (4201) 17.4%
Con (4199) 17.4%
Green (4014) 16.6%
Ah yes... again, I see why we're ignoring the most recent poll figure for the constituency. The Lib Dems poll figured has fallen by 10%, and they were THREE VOTES away from slipping behind the Conservatives in the constituency. And with the Greens on the march, they've almost made it a five-way marginal (with the usual caveats about European elections, PR and turnout of course).
So there were go. "It's a two horse race here in Edinburgh North and Leith." Well, if it is, the Lib Dems probably aren't one of the horses...
9 comments:
And it's intriguing that there's only 4% between the best and worst vote in a five party split - clearly there's still all to play for and it's a five-horse race ;0)
With caveats (ie, turnout, the fact it was a PR election, the fact it was a European election, the ranking as a third-order election) yes.
But its a cunning Lib Dem trick!
As much as fun as it is bashing the Lib Dems, if they had put Scottish Parliament or Euro poll figures on a Westminster leaflet they'd get pelters even more so.
They do need to recalibrate their bar charts though, shameless stuff.
I do like the photos of Kevin Lang gormlessly pointing at rubbish or graffiti in the area.
If he wins, I'm moving house....
If Kevin Lang wins, you'd do well to stay where you are, Jeff. I have known him well for a long time now - in fact, I was slating him the other night for daring to turn 30 because it makes me feel old as I first knew him when he was a student.
Anyway, the point of that is to say that he's one of the most hard working, energetic people I've ever met and North and Leith and he would work so hard for the area. The fact that both you and Malc spend so much time whinging about how many leaflets you get from surely proves my point:-)
And, Jeff, you made the point I would have done about what would be said if we'd used a different election result on a Westminster election based leaflet.
Let's have a wee comparison of the performance of the Lib Dems and the SNP in North and Leith over the past 10 years. While the SNP hasn't even regained its 1999 position (which, if you remember, was an election it didn't do that well in) by 2007 (which, if you remember, was an election it won), the Lib Dems came from 11% and 4th place in 1999 to 27% in 2007. In an election we didn't do as well in as we'd hoped, Mike Crockart, whose campaign had been masterminded by Kevin Lang, saw a 10.4% increase in the Lib Dem vote.
To me that clearly shows that the Lib Dems are the main challenger to Labour in Edinburgh North and Leith.
And which election is next ? Westminster or Scottish parliament ? Knowing (surely you know) that results vary greatly from Scottish parliamentary elections to Westminster elections (just look at Aberdeen South or Inverness East) there is nothing wrong with showing the graph for the next election ?
Caron & Norfolk Blogger,
I do indeed accept that people vote differently in different elections. I've studied enough Scottish (and indeed, other) elections to know that. And "regionalist" parties (in academic terms) tend to do better in "regional" elections - such as the SNP in Holyrood.
I was merely pointing out that, in the two more recent canvasses of opinion in the constituency, the Lib Dems have not fared quite so well and, indeed, that their claim to be the "only party that can beat Labour here" may not be quite as true as they would like voters to believe.
PS - Caron, the SNP did pretty well in 1999 - they won 35 seats, only 12 less than in 2007. Granted most of them were regional MSPs, but still.
The SNP were very disappointed not to do better in 1999 - but even so, they still didn't regain their 1999 vote in 2007 in Edinburgh North and Leith.
Great post Malc - Im so sick of the ridiculous number of daft Lib Dem leaflets I get in Glasgow North plastered with the image of Katy Gordon making tea to crossing the road! The claims for the forth coming election are amazing, again based on the 2005 result in bar chart form off course. They are so misleading and frankly dishonest when there are good result breakdowns for Glasgow North from Holyrood 2007 and Euro 2009 which show that the election is a straight fight between Ann McKechin and Patrick Grady. Katy's great and she deserves more , but its just not going to happen.
Must be a heavy burden to bear, living in a multiple-horse constituency such as EN&L. My seat has been Labour since Noah was a boy and will still be when the sun goes into supernova, so I'm freed from all electoral responsibility.Idahoans Depend on Carriers

I've actually come full circle on "Born in the USA." Probably didn't listen to it straight through from 1986-1999, after popular radio DJ's killed it. Then after hearing his slower, darker, demo-ish version on Tracks and in the live shows from '99, I gave it another shot.

looks like a-rod's got some time on his hands.One month after Washington’s women claimed the NCAA title in dramatic fashion, associate head coach Andrea VanderLende surprisingly stepped down from coaching.
VanderLende, who turns 33 on July 6, said the move is not a retirement. It’s more of a change in direction.
“It’s time to become a head coach,” she said, “or do something else.”
The stiff competition in women’s college golf isn’t limited to players. The influx of assistant-coaching positions across the board, and additional head-coaching jobs at new programs, means it could be a long wait for the right fit. Also, as salaries have improved, more male coaches have moved into women’s college golf.
“Every year there’s not that many jobs that are open,” VanderLende said. “I just had to think about the big picture.”
VanderLende played a big role in Washington’s recent success. She spent seven years working alongside longtime coach Mary Lou Mulflur, who said VanderLende made her a better coach by pushing her.
“Andrea is as good as there is in the business,” Mulflur said.
VanderLende’s sparkling personality and keen eye made her a strong recruiter.
“When she walks in a room, people want to be around her and want to talk to her,” Mulflur said.
VanderLende loves the mentoring aspect of coaching and could see herself working in player development. But really, her mind is open. “I have big goals and I want to do big things,” she said.
VanderLende played for Florida in 2001-05 and was the NCAA runner-up in 2003.
VanderLende certainly leaves the college coaching business in style. In the championship match at Eugene Country Club against Stanford, VanderLende told Huskies senior Ying Luo that she could hole the 61-yard pitch shot she faced on the 18th hole for birdie.
Luo believed it, and delivered.
“It’s like a dream,” VanderLende said.
Time for a new one.Ambulatory Care Nursing - ACN
Ambulatory Care Nursing is a complex, multifaceted specialty that encompasses independent and collaborative research in clinical practice and development of theoretical knowledge.
Group members
Anna Carin Wahlberg
Veronica Lindström
Research focus
Ambulatory Care Nursing is built on a broad knowledge of both nursing and caring sciences. Nursing science focuses on the human-universe-health process, the discipline specific knowledge is focused on development and use of knowledge concerning nursing’s phenomenon of concern. Caring science is developed as a human science based on an existential philosophy reviewing the spiritual basis of caring, where caring is the moral ideal of nursing. Caring science takes its starting point in human experiences, reactions and needs in their life situation.
Ambulatory Care Nursing includes those clinical, organizational and professional activities for individuals, groups, and populations who seek assistance with improving health and/or seek care for health-related problems outside established health care facilities as hospitals and community care. The ambulatory care is performed at both physical contacts, by telephone and at video meetings. The nurse-patient encounters may occur once or as a series of occurrences, and the encounter is less than 24 hours in length at any time. The nurse-patient encounter aims to advice, assist and support patients to manage their health care and/or advise them to optimal level of care.

RNA was isolated from floral buds collected from field grown plants of the relatively cold hardy cultivar 'Bluecrop' that received 0, 70, 400, 800 and 1200 chill hours and from greenhouse/cold room-grown plants that received 0, 500, and 1000 chill hours. Total RNA was used to make cDNAs, which were labeled with Alexa Flour 555 and Alexa Flour 647 dyes. Dye-swap labeling was carried out on two biological replicates. After hybridization, slides were scanned, data normalized using lowess print-tip method and ratios of the two signals estimated to determine relative levels of transcripts after different exposures to low temperature. T-tests and ANOVA will be used to determine statistically significant up and down-regulated genes with cold acclimation under field and cold room conditions.We 39K condensate trapped in an optical lattice, where Bloch oscillations are forced by gravity. The fine-tuning of the scattering length down to 0:1 a0 and the micrometric sizes of the atomic sample make our system a very promising candidate for measuring forces with high spatial resolution. Our technique can be in principle extended to other measurement schemes opening new possibilities in the field of trapped atom interferometry.Never got a chance to have our lunch because the restaurant closed it's door July 9th due to bankruptcy but yet I still received a confirmation email from Open Table confirming my reservation.
I am not qualified to make a review based upon my last reservation because when we arrived for our 5:30 reservation, the restaurant was closed! Although we could see glasses and menus on the tables through the windows, the outer doors were locked.
Great location, beautiful outdoor sitting towards the lagoon. Gear food and wine list.
Went there for lunch. We're were not impressed with either dish.
I go here often and I usually leave a review. Our service was pretty good and the food was good, as well. I got a free birthday dessert. The only thing I would comment on is the male host who wasn't very friendly. He seemed to have a stank attitude the two times that we spoke with him. He did wish me a happy birthday.. but even that sounded forced. I really love the food and location of Spice, but the wait staff needs improved. It wasn't always like this.
Stopped in with our kids early evening on Saturday while running an errand downtown. We were so happily surprised! Can't wait to go back!!
It was Hot! It doesn't seems to me AC works over there at all. We address our concerns to Server but unsuccessfuly. Check or call them before you going if they fix AC , very uncomfortable
We enjoyed the food - initially the air was warm and humid inside, but it did get better. The service was OK, not great.
First visit for lunch. Nice breadth of menu items for lunch including a variety of sandwiches and salads. Very large wine list and decent number of craft beers.
The Montreal Reuben was very good. The burger and Turkey Brie sandwich were very tasty.
Will definitely return.
Always great service, nice atmosphere and can't beat the view. Mixed menu selection and longer brunch hours than most places downtown. I haven't had anything I didn't like from soups, salads, sandwiches, main dishes. Good drink options as well.Oct. 18, 2006
Well, I told you so. No one was sent packing from Wednesday’s generously named “results” show. The only casualty, beyond Sara Evans’ departure, was credibility.
I mean, really. It’s bad enough that Tom announces the boot-off couple each week with pauses so pregnant they could spur contractions, but this week’s two shows brought 2 1/2 hours of trumped up waiting and “drama” — at the end of which, as I suspected and as I warned, nothing happened.
Well, Jerry again made the bottom two, this time joined unjustly by Joey. But as we bit our nails into nubs, Tom finally . . . revealed . . . after all the waiting . . . and suspense . . . that . . . no one was leaving.
No shock there, since losing another couple would mean the season would run a show short at the end. When you’re one of TV’s top-rated programs, you just don’t do that.
The good news is that all the votes counted. Viewer and judges votes from this week will be added to viewer and judges votes next week to determine who goes home then. So this week’s competition, at least, wasn’t in vain. Instead, it was half of an aggregate score yet to come.
Will Joey survive Jerry’s dance-challenged fan base? Will Mario make new “friends” off the dance floor? Will Samantha ever master the English language and employ better repartee than “That’s right”?
Yes, there’s still some suspense to be savored. But this week was a yawner.

- Completion Date: 2011
- Construction Cost: $3.36 million
Project brief
The project consisted of specialized repairs to preserve the exteriors of Randolph Hall, Towell Library, and Porter’s Lodge within the historic Cistern Area of the College of Charleston. These included structural remediation in selected areas of each building with associate brick masonry repairs, conservation of decorative stonework, historic lime-based stucco repairs, limewashing of select areas to blend repairs, slate roof repairs, restoration of historic wood windows and shutters, and repairs to historic ornamental gates and fences.
In June 2006, we were commissioned to develop a Conservation Master Plan to assess conditions of these three buildings and surrounding grounds. The resulting two volume Plan, completed in February 2007, contained detailed building descriptions, an evolutionary history, conditions survey results, laboratory analyses of material samples, paint stratigraphies, structural analyses, CAD drawings of the buildings, prioritized repair recommendations, and repair cost estimates. This Plan was initially used to secure project funding and then served to organize the preparation of construction plans and specifications. This Plan was instrumental in helping the College shape a preservation philosophy to guide the work.
Construction work began in August 2009 and was aided throughout by the extensive involvement of an architectural conservator to ensure compliance with the detailed specifications. In depth examination of concealed conditions required additional structural repairs to be made in order to restore the buildings’ integrity without altering the buildings’ forms. Examination of Randolph Hall’s column capitals – among the earliest examples of architectural terra cotta in the country – resulted in a campaign to salvage and repair damaged units and to provide replacement-in-kind unites so that these design features of E.B. White’s 1851 portico addition could be successfully restored.
Stone masonry restoration techniques employed on all of the buildings included anchoring, pinning, patching, injection grouting, and installation of matching Portland brownstone Dutchmen to various decorative members. Examination of roof surfaces led to extensive slate shingle and clay tile ridge cap repairs and replacement of copper flashings. Aided by laboratory analyses of existing historic stucco samples, a stucco conservation and restoration program was implemented. This involved extensive sampling, preparation of mock-ups, test panel applications of cleaning agents and demonstration of surface textures to ensure that repairs would be compatible with historic surfaces. Removal and replacement of inappropriate stuccoes, repairs to stucco cracks and removal of improper surface treatments were all carefully executed. Every wood window sash and shutter on each building underwent a thorough campaign to remove, catalog, repair, weather-strip, reglaze, and restore to operating condition these character defining elements. Ferrous metal repairs involved restoring salvaged railing sections and anchoring loose railing, fence, and gate members followed by preparation and painting of all historic ironwork. In addition to work on the buildings themselves, a carefully designed plan to restore the earlier character of the site was implemented, including an area for native plant species. A major feature in this landscape design was sensitive, safe, and focused lighting to compliment both the architecture and the natural beauty of the mature oak trees.How to Make an Easy Mango Popsicle

Wen you say unhealed, what do you mean?
Have you gone through the 8-step procedure?
Sorry about that post being so vague I am just frustrated right now. This is a freinds PC with no AV software or firewall for over a year. Can not run a single program without some sort of problem.
Using AVG Free 8.5 Virus scanner ended up finding i-worm/bagle.q infected every EXE file. AVG was able to "HEAL" , their terms not mine, all but 8 it had listed as WHITE Files that should not be removed. Upon restart I still get AVG message that this virus is still there with no "FIX" option.
I am running their VCLEANER tool right now to see if this helps me out.
I did run SAS, MB and CC ealier with about 2 week old definitons because I was unable to get updates to problem pc and they did find lots of problems and corrected them.
I will run VCLEANER then follow 8 step program again with updated def files.
Now it all becomes much cleaer, you should have mentioned that before. Throw out AVG and use the 8-step method to scan the PC. There are many stubborn users out there who want to use their own software thnking it''s the same , but trust me, use the programs in the 8-step I sent on my last link. Furthermore, if it's been running that long without security software,:dead: I would reinstall the o/s with a full format.
First, there are so many individual "stinger" type virus removal tools available, it's really hard to keep track of them. Macafee has them, and M$ has a malicious software removal tool also, updated monthly.
Avg Free always gets somewhat of a bad rap here. It's really not that bad a product. But, everything is going to have a hard time after a year of no security software.
On a more philosophical level, I'm quite frankly baffled, why you choose to punish yourself for the stupidity of another. So, if one of my "friends" came up to me with this issue. I'd immediately come to his aid, by jamming the Windows disc in the machine, and giving him a fresh start.
So, then before this occurred, if, and more likely when, the litany of excuses began for not wanting to reformat, "I don't have a Windows disc", "I never back up any files", and my personal favorite, "then I'll have to reinstall all the cracked infected programs again", I would ask myself, "who's problem is this really"? At the end of the day, not yours!
So, you can d*** around for hours and hours, trying to rebuild the OS files, or simply it's say, "time to reinstall", and be done with it.
Seconded!
Gee, thanks for the backup Captain
As for this comment, I've come across too many stubborn people who don't do the 8-steps properly, and when they finally give in, and ditch the AVG or Norton, they realize that the 8-steps is the way it is for a reason.
But yeah, after a year of not having protection, you obviously don't care about what's on your system so don't waste any time and 'wipe it clean'.:approve:
OK 8 steps complete. Logs attached. I understand you guys' feelings, I learned the hard way lost alot of stuff. My friends not to tech savy and need to keep their data including kids photos, so I offered to help try to get it were we coudl back up the importtant stuff before blowing it all away.
THanks for your time
8 steps complete with AVAST this time
i-worm/bagel.q infection originally and some trojans found. AVAST ran this time instead of AVG, updated CC, MB, and SAS and re-ran. NEwl ogs attached. Am I clean now?
Thanks Again for lookingToday I got some shinies in the post - some posable metal skeletons from Ebob Miniatures:
This afternoon and evening I spent painting up my entry for the Nautical bonus theme round. It's also (part of) my revenge for this disgraceful entry from Ray in the last bonus round. Curt should be posting them sometime late tomorrow, so keep an eye out for it.
Tomorrow I'll be getting some more figures ready for painting and might make a start on some more Aztecs. During the week I'll finish those off and might start work on my entry for the final bonus theme round - it may or may not be the second part of my revenge!
Mass effect on the first picture is outstanding, well done!
Those ACW bases are excellent. You want to give some C19th European armies a go and then try out the Bruce Weigle rules series.
I've just seen the army 'en masse' - sensational stuff Tamsin.
Why do I feel like the insult entries are starting to escalate a little? ;-)
Ray is a bad man - I suggest a suitable punishment is that he pays for dinner when I'm next in London! Tamsin, Lee how do you stand on this just and fair proposal?
Looks like a fun hobby for sure.
Happy Sunday.
Dear Tamsin,
My,my,my...what a terrific looking job! From everything I've read the effect you've achieved is almost exactly the look that soldiers advancing in the open would have had. Obviously if the troops are in the Devil's Den or defending the sunken road at Antieteam, the look would have been different. But for mass effect you are trying to achieve - this is perfect. Well done, well done!!
Jerry
@ Phil - thanks! The look of the figures en masse is the great benefit of 6mm :)
@ Gary - one period in 6mm is enough for me! :)
@ Michael A - thanks! It is gratifying to see them all together :)
@ The Responsible One - because they are? ;)
It's actually friendly banter and mickey-taking :)
@ Miles - now, that does seem like a good idea in theory, but we'd probably end up with doner kebabs from Dysentry Joe's van :)
@ Whisk - thanks! It is a fun hobby :)
@ Jerry - cheers! Did you spot the yellow bands on the kepis of the standard bearers on the command stands? :)By Dr. John Piperwillchild.
Yes, just as the man must work out his salvation through the cursed futilities and miseries of his labor (Genesis 3:18–19), millions of women must find her salvation through the pains and miseries of childbearing. The path of salvation is the same for her as for all the saints: “continuing in faith and love and holiness, with self-control.”
Jesus Christ is the Savior who became a curse for us (Galatians 3:13). The sting of the curse has been removed. It cannot damn us anymore. Faith in him is the link to the Savior. Love, holiness, and self-control are the authenticating fruits of this faith.
At the last day every vestige of the curse will be undone and every wound will be healed. That is part of what it means to be saved through faith in Christ.Lexington County, SC (WLTX) -- A Lexington County man convicted of child sexual assault has been sentenced to life in prison, according to Eleventh Circuit Solicitor Rick Hubbard
A jury deliberated less than an hour before finding Bryan Jeffrey Ellis, 30, guilty of first-degree criminal sexual conduct with a minor and third-degree criminal sexual conduct with a minor, according to the solicitor.
Judge R. Knox McMahon then imposed a life sentence on Ellis with a consecutive sentence of 15 years. Under state law, the life sentence means that Ellis will never be eligible for parole.
“The loss of innocence is something you can never get back and will not be tolerated in Lexington County," said Solicitor Hubbard. "The sentence today sends a clear message."
Prosecutors say Ellis sexually assaulted a 7-year-old girl on multiple occasions. The Lexington County Sheriff’s Department began an investigation on January 24, 2016, after the girl told a family member about the abuse and a 911 call was placed. Ellis later admitted to the sexual assaults.
Ellis' confession, seven pages in length and in his own handwriting, was offered as evidence during the trial. Family members of the child also testified that Ellis admitted his guilt to them when they confronted him.
The child victim, now age 9, testified during the trial and identified Ellis as having assaulted her numerous times.
Evidence recovered from Ellis' smart phone revealed that Ellis was using the device to research information on sex addiction less than two hours before giving his confession to law enforcement.
During the sentencing hearing, Judge McMahon spoke of the child's "stolen innocence" and called Ellis a “predator.” He described the life sentence as a "necessary measure to protect the community" and ensure that Ellis will not harm additional victims in the future.
Ellis is being transferred to the S.C. Department of Corrections to begin his sentence immediately, according to Solicitor Hubbard.

President Zuma: R9.2bn will be spend on Saldanha oil, gas hub
A total of R9.2bn will be spent on developing Saldanha Bay as an oil and gas
hub, President Jacob Zuma said on Thursday. In addition, R660m would be spent on the construction of a Burgan fuel storage facility in the port of Cape Town, he said. Zuma was addressing the media on the progress made in Operation Phakisa, a bid to bring together business, government and academia to reignite the country's economic growth and to boost job creation.
South Africa needed to play a more active role in the ocean economy, said Zuma. "We are not utilising our waters. There is such [an] economy there that we have never attempted to look at." We need to work together, not in competition. The opportunities are too much. There is enough. "He said he hoped the ocean economies would help to grow a variety of local industries. The government was currently exploring opportunities of repairing rigs and servicing vessels, he said." Thirty thousand vessels pass through South Africa's waters every year, and 13 000 dock in our ports every year. "South Africa only does maintenance on 5% of the vessels. In addition, of the 80 rigs in the Western Cape, only four are serviced per year," Zuma said.
A study conducted by the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University in 2010 on the value of South Africa's oceans revealed that the coastlines had the potential to contribute R54bn to the country's GDP and 316000 jobs, he said.
"In 2013, it found nine sectors of the
economy could generate a GDP contribution of between R129bn and R177bn by 2033 and double the number of jobs." Operation Phakisa was launched in October last year.Member of the

Walter had Oat Pecan pie with ice cream. This, too, was incredible.
There was a chocolate pie that had just come out of the oven while we were there yesterday. Kathy is saving a piece for us so we can have it when we go today.
Walter is in his hippie outfit. We were doing laundry yesterday so he put together and on whatever he could find.
Walter and I stayed a while yesterday talking about future stuff…dreams we have. We have a few different ideas.
Of course, I’ll keep the leather business going, maybe try to expand it a bit, but Walter, like me and my sister and Bri and my mom, dreams of having a little café of some sort.
My ideal café would have our green house outside so everything comes from what we grow and we just have food on the weekends or something like that and on the other days a homemade baked good and always really good coffee and cappuccinos.
We would have books with big cushy chairs and a fireplace. I would have a little corner in the shop that would be my workshop so I could be there all day with everyone and take custom orders. The horses would be outside (with Nico training them) and, I think, a dog would be at my side, and we would have live music out on the porch or inside when it’s cold.
Now, there’s a Mendocino or Elk or Mariposa, CA. dream and a New England dream. New England would have a Christmas Tree Farm with a horse drawn carriage that brings you to get your tree and then back through the covered bridge to the little store where you can have hot apple cider. In the fall we would have apples. I’ve already planted 6 apple trees on our land in NH, but I think they are stunted because the deer got to them and did a number on them in their first year. They’re still my sweet little babies though and I love them with or without apples!
The tough part is getting everyone together. I feel very at home in New England and in CA as well and I will go wherever, but some have to be in CA and some want to stay in New England. Maybe everyone will settle for one of those middle states. ;) Nope, not gonna happen.
Anyway, we’ll figure it out.
So we were talking and talking, enjoying dreaming about what might be and then Kathy brought over some pretty flowers to the table and set them in front of us. Another woman said “those are the last of our Spring flowers!” and then turned her head to the snow outside.
Kathy sat down next to me with her bowl and started peeling the pears in it. We talked about the little town and how she came to live there.
It was her mother who had the dream of making pies in pie town.
“Kathy! It’s a town called Pie Town and no one’s making pies!” her mother had said to her.
Kathy was living in Dallas living a much ritzier life full of corporate dinners and fancy outfits.
She decided to back the Pie Town business financially and helped her mom begin her dream. For a few years it was Kathy, her mom, and Kathy’s daughter running the little restaurant.
There were arguments and wonderful times. Sometimes Kathy would have to shut the door to the kitchen and say, “no one leaves until we talk this out”.
“We had one bathroom and three women.” She said with a smile and her index finger shooting into the air.
This is something I know all too well and love. Our little house in NH only has one bathroom and it became the hang out for my sister, my mom, and I. If one was in there, the other two were soon to follow. One would sit on the bathroom floor, one on the toilet, and one (or two) was usually taking a bath.
We would talk and talk about everything. Our house isn’t insulated as well as it could be and when someone was taking a bath it warmed up the little room making it the most comfortable place to sit around and talk. If it was really cold, one or two would be in the tub and one of us would sit on the edge with our feet warming in the water.
Kathy said those were an amazing few years. Even though it was busy and bustling and she was torn between two lives, she has beautiful memories of the three of them together in that little shop.
The shop is at 7,900 feet and it made it hard for her mom to breathe. She developed emphysema and was told she needed to be at a lower elevation. Kathy’s mom loved it there and wasn’t leaving. She said soon her mom was bent over hot ovens with a tank next to her blowing oxygen into her nose and a full restaurant waiting to be fed.
This caused Kathy to make a decision. She had a husband back in Dallas and they both loved each other, but it came to a point where it was that life or this life. She was happy in a pick-up truck with a dog and wasn’t really at home in the city. She chose the country and the two divorced.
Even though it was Kathy’s choice, it was incredibly emotional and difficult. Kathy’s mom is no longer at the café (I didn’t ask why) and her daughter went off to college leaving Kathy alone with the café.
It was really hard for her. She was now alone and unsure.
There’s nothing around here, not even a grocery store, so everything has to come from far away. Kathy’s mom made pies, but also served breakfast, lunch, and dinner 7 days a week. Kathy was cooking things like chicken fried steak (which she doesn’t even like) and making pies, but not making them the way she makes them now.
Eventually another little café came to town and Kathy was able to focus on what she loved: pie.
She told me with a smile that her ex-husband came to visit her once and said “I can’t believe what you’ve done for yourself here”.
She is now in love with a man who works with her baking some of the most delicious pies you will ever taste and has been a guest on the food network channel, has been featured in many magazines, and just won a contest for the best chocolate in new Mexico (her chocolate pie). She didn’t even know she was entered in a contest!
“There are pie spies”, she said.
She was singing “let it snow, let it snow, let it snow” from the kitchen yesterday as the snow fell outside the café window, and the young woman who serves the guests (and is from upstate New York) was saying “What is this, New Mexico!!?? It’s MAY!”
Kathy eventually said, “I better go check that pie in the oven” and got up from the table, but she was soon back with her now peeled pears and sticks of ginger to dice and add to her bowl. She sat down again and we talked about things and the value we put on them.
I can’t remember how we got into that conversation. Walter and I had been talking about Yosemite and somehow it shifted into things we hold on to.
Kathy told us a story about these two beautiful rings she had that she lost and how she had to really practice what she preached and let go of them. She said it was hard for a few days, but eventually she came to the conclusion that she enjoyed them while she had them and had to accept that her time with them had passed, but that it was wonderful while it lasted.
She said she felt good with them on and got compliments on them and would look at them and smile. She just loved them. They were one-of-a-kind pieces and brought a lot of joy to her. After calling the place she left them at about 3 times, she turned her place upside down thinking maybe she left them somewhere (you know how you do that when you lose something-you look and look anywhere even though you know where you left it…just in case). Well, she ended up finding two rings that are much more simple at the bottom of one of her drawers. She put one on each hand where the other rings had been and looked at her hands and smiled. She did this as she was telling the story and I looked at the two silver rings on each hand.
She said, “You know, they do the job. It’s not the same, but I like them.”
She says possessions can start to control you and lose what beauty they have. They are no longer something you just love, but something you think you need and can’t be without, but it’s rarely ever true. You can always be without those things.
I wear my Grandfather’s St. Christopher around my neck and I touch it probably a hundred times a day. I often wonder, “What would I do if I lost this? My heart would break. I could lose it riding”. It made me feel a little better about this.
I needed the necklace right after Pop died. I still need it, and I hope I wear it forever, but it’s not him. It’s a memory of him and that will never go, even if this St. Christopher does. With that said, I sure hope I never lose it!
I thought yesterday was going to be warmer, but it was really cold. Today is even wetter and colder. I wouldn’t have expected this in New Mexico, but we are at nearly 8,000 feet.
Sojourner took some huge steps yesterday. I am looking forward to the clinic to see what else we can get out of him. I only hope it’s not this cold because I will hate that.
I was sitting on the fence watching Soj and Larry came up from behind me and said, “Well, let’s see who catches who.”
I said “alright” and went over to get Soj. Soj was at the other end of the field, but when he saw me hop off the fence he started toward me and we met in the middle. He put his sweet head down and I slipped the halter on.
I thought “Ha. That was good. He’ll like that.”
When I brought him back Larry drew a circle in the sand and said I had to brush Soj without leaving the little circle. I thought we did alright. I stepped out for a minute, but if I was paying more attention I think I could have stayed in the circle. Soj was good about moving around the way I asked so I could brush all sides. We’ll work on it more.
Larry showed me some basic moves that will be gone over more in the clinic so I’ll talk about them later. I’ll film bits of it as well and post those up here.
Soj and I look like we have the same personality, don't we? "Ummm..yes, okay. Wait, explain again?"
After some basic stuff we went over to a big tire and I was asked to get Soj to step up on it.
Soj is pretty good about going where I go so I stepped up on the tire first. This didn’t work. He thought about it and kinda bent his leg to maybe lift it…then no. No step up.
We'll just watch you guys a while.
“How is he supposed to get up there with you up on that tire?” Larry asked.
“There’s room!” I said, “it’ll work!”
It didn’t though.
Larry made the point that Soj was starting to get comfortable in a certain spot. He would walk up to the tire and then stop even though I was asking him to come further. Every time Soj did this I needed to ask, wait, and if he didn’t budge then he got worked. I was to lunge him and then quickly bring him back to the tire and ask him to get up on it. On the tire would be rest, but not in front of it. We did this over and over, but Soj wouldn’t step up.
Larry very politely came over and asked if he could help and I willingly gave him the rope. He brought Soj over to where some logs were on the ground so he would have to engage his mind and jump. When I was lunging Soj he was just kind of running around me like a nut and then going back to the tire. I wasn’t really asking him to think.
Larry made him jump about 4 or 5 times and then brought him back to the tire.
And then he was up.
After this we went over to a trailer. Now, Soj has always gotten into bigger trailers, but he has never backed out. He went into the bigger trailer right away. There was a young colt in there who Larry had been working with earlier as well as food, so I think it looked pretty safe to Soj.
Backing him out was a bit of a challenge, but with some work, he did back out.
Larry backing up Soj on the ground
Larry had worked with him on the ground before the tire and the biggest ground lesson was backing up. James and I had worked with this kind of stuff in a similar fashion back at his ranch in Joshua Tree, so Soj had a bit of an idea of what to do.
The colt that was in the trailer had only been in a trailer once before and had a saddle on for the first time that day. This is a horse that was deemed “un-trainable” by some other trainers before coming to The Horseman’s Haven Retreat to work with Larry. He’s a really solid Quarter Horse and is going to be something pretty awesome to see when he’s done. You can already tell.
The Colt putting its front two hooves in the rubber bucket.
Larry said “I don’t know if this will work, but…”
We headed over to the very little, very narrow trailer that I know scares the pants off Soj. Larry asked him to go on and of course Soj wanted nothing to do with it.
He lunged him all around the trailer and probably within about 3 minutes he was in that little trailer.
Larry never shuts the door on a horse who is just getting used to a trailer so Soj just stayed in there. We let him hang out and then after about 10 minutes or so, Soj backed out and just stood there calmly by the trailer. I couldn’t believe it.
Larry asked Soj to go in two more times and back out before we put him up for the evening. He was a little hesitant after backing out the first time to go back in again, but he just had to be lunged a bit and then he stepped back up and in. The third time was pretty easy.
The plan is to work more today, but it’s really snowing outside so I’m not sure we will. Doesn’t sound like fun for any of us.
What does sound fun is pie and coffee for the third day in a row. Then I am going to sit by the fire and start on a few belts. I am starting a wildflower belt and some Irish belts with vines and Celtic designs.
We are going to do some more pictures and video editing as well....
Until tomorrow....
That is so great!!! I am so proud of Soj, what a great experience you guys are having. Horsemans Haven sounds like a wonderful place with wonderful, talented people.
Keep eating those pies, you still have a few more miles to go, and can use the pie power. You are becoming a true "Pie-o-neer... Guess who said that.
This is Natural Horsemanship at it's finest here! Most excellent...both of you learned alot yesterday! I have trained about 100 horses with Larry's style...and it has never failed me. There is also "beyond natural horsemanship" which is the next step.... which further helps horses utilize their natural instincts to become part of the decision maing process with you. Ask Larry if he has ever heard of that. :) Did you know a horse will automatically know where to cross a body of water/river/lake/stream about 1/8th of a mile before you get to a stream or river...Their smell and hearing tells them where the water is running fastest, where it is the best to cross. Many horses will traverse natural obstacles that way. When in doubt let your horse to the thinking, when they are scared offer reassurance, when they are not confident be their leader, when they don't want to...understand why.
A favorite quote of mine that I have been using alot lately is "show me your horse and I will show you who you are". Yes, horses are a mirror that reflect our deepest desires and souls.
I lost a set of rings and let it go in a short amount of time. They were worth thousands. One day...in the bottom of a drawer...these reappeared -- two years later. This reminds me of how love goes: as love is better to have love and lost than never to have loved at all...and to rediscover it again is more than we could have possibly hoped for, imagined or dreamed to experience! I hope we all let our scars fall in love again...and we all get that chance to rediscover those "rings at the bottom of a drawer".
Enjoy the day...
Hard to add anything new or different than what comments are here already. I completely enjoy your writing style. I am not able to say exactly what it is but there is a certain transparency about it that allows me to see further into those moments you are describing. Partly, I think it is also because you you mix what happens and reflect upon those "happenings" in such a way as to make it hard to miss what you felt as you were there in the moment. And the photos are outstanding as well. What a portfolio, or at least a great collection to have on the walls of your cafe!Created By: Sarah Mims
This log cabin is one of the oldest houses in Chester County. Although no exact date exists, the best guess is that the house dates from approximately 1700. Caleb Harvey lived in the frame and log house and raised vegatables on a large scale. On Saturdays, he would take his Model T truck to a stand at the West Chester market. He died in 1952. At some point, a Victorian house was built over the log cabin house, making it twice the size. Later, the Victorian house was demolished and the log cabin was fully exposed again. However, it has once again been covered over. "There was a pump in the house. The well was inside an addition to that side of the house. There used to be a stream very close to the side of the house. You could go down over the back of the property, there was a stream, and there was a place where water could be gotten to bring up to the pigs. There used to be black snakes up in the strawberry patch up behind"

Document Type: Feature article
Abstract:
In 1977, Boston's water supply system had so many leaks and so many unmetered or undermetered customers that only about half the water entering the system was accounted for. The capital program, needed to assure the long-term physical health of the system, was inadequate. In that year, the water and sewer departments were spun off into a separate Water & Sewer Commission, empowered to set user charges at an appropriate level to cover both operating and capital costs. The new Commission is doing so well, Boston's program is seen as a model of how to tune up a municipal water system.

If we are not careful this is what our meditation looks like. “Why is she mad at me?” “Why is he upset.” “How am I going to get that money?” or whatever or it is we are worried about.
All these thoughts and mantras, are okay, some are quite good, but the ancients say, and I agree, that if we put our attention on the spirit within, and meditate, and focus on the good, like things we are thankful for, the rest takes care of itself. Ideas, information, help, show up out of nowhere, and we find ourselves experiencing great peace and happiness.

Burnley butcher George Heys struck gold with the “Hot Off the Press” sausage which was created to mark the newspaper’s milestone year.
George, who runs Heys Butchers shop in Lyndhurst Road, saw the brilliant banger bag a gold award at the British Pig Executive (BPEX) Regional Roadshow.
The prize-winning pork sausage, which contains a mix of herbs, nutmeg, black pepper and toasted onions, was even given a whopping 99 out of 100 mark in the competition at Bolton’s Reebok Stadium.
George’s son Danny, who works at the family business, said: “The ‘Hot off the Press’ sausage was just a special edition for the Burnley Express 125th anniversary but because the customers liked it so much we have kept selling it in the shop.
“The judges liked it too – the Burnley Express sausage got 99 out of 100 marks. To get a mark like that is amazing. It is pretty impossible to get 100%. The judges rarely give out 100 but it was our highest scoring mark on the day.
“It has been a really big success. We will certainly keep selling it.”
The family butcher shop is celebrating a total of six gold awards and five silvers at the prestigious pork industry event including sausages, burgers and sausage rolls.
One of the golds was given to Neil Whittaker in the “Young Butcher Section” for his “Moroccan Marvel” sausage. Danny (33) said: “It is a really big event. It is great to get feedback from all the judges – they were really happy about all the products we had entered. It is absolutely fantastic to do so well.”
George added: “I think they have done really well. They were all new products that have never been judged before. It bodes well for the future.”Most of the listed Medicines are Prescription Only and require a Doctor’s prescription. Item’s and price’s listed in the following document are subject to change.

Nov 16 2017 48567 1

Views: 95
Winter offers some unique opportunities for sellers, so ignore your instincts to let your home hibernate.
It’s one of real estate’s most enduring mantras: If you want to list your house, you should sit out the winter season and let it hit the market in the spring instead. But like so many things in life, finding the best time to sell a house or list that Boston, MA real estate is more complicated.
“The general school of thought — and it most often proves to be correct — is that listing your home in the spring market will reap the biggest benefit,” says salesperson Brad Malow of Douglas Elliman in New York, NY. “But late winter may actually be a prime time for coming to market as well.”. And if your house is the only game in town, you’re likely to have a lot more interest than in spring when the market is saturated.
“If there’s a shortage of desirable inventory, which often means a plethora of buyers waiting on the sidelines, a seller may experience multiple-offer situations whenever they choose to list,” says Malow. With fewer options, traditionally nit-picky home shoppers are more likely to forgo their “must-have” list and give your place a more open-minded look.
2. First-quarter job relocations
Companies tend to place and/or relocate their workers during the first quarter of the new year. This means that every winter, there is an assured populace that’s looking for a new home, quickly. And good news for your asking price: This group often has some credited moving expenses to burn through. If you live close to a large corporation, ask your real estate agent how to target the new employees coming to town.
3. A locked-in real estate agent
Your real estate agent is relatively idle during the frosty months, a drag from their perspective but a boon from yours. And fewer clients means greater motivation to move the properties they represent. They also have more time and energy to focus on your cause, whether it’s finessing your online listing or talking you off the ledge when the selling process becomes challenging or stressful.front property and backyard are up to snuff at every possible moment.
In wintertime, though, the living is easy. If there’s snow, you shovel — that’s pretty much it. No after-work and weekend hours toiling to maintain your outdoor space, and no stresses about its supposed inadequacies.
5. A lighter footprint, literally.
It also means fewer open houses, which can take hours of preparation and don’t always pay off. If you do have a winter open house, you’ll also probably have more motivated visitors — there are very few window-shoppers during the cold-weather months, so you’re not going to see your neighbor’s son’s friend meandering over to report back on your recent kitchen reno.
6. A faster home sale
It’s counterintuitive but true: Homes actually sell more quickly in the winter months, even in cold-weather cities like Chicago, IL. There’s no general consensus on exactly why this is true, although low inventory is quite likely a big part of it. Also? In winter, most people just don’t want to slog through showing after showing. Instead, they want the buying process to be over and done with, and so they’re more willing to pull the trigger.
7. A higher listing price
Another surprise: Statistics show that homes actually sell at a slightly higher price in winter. This owes to several less mysterious factors. For starters, your real estate agent is going to be more adamant about pricing the property just right out of fear the home will languish on the market until spring. (If a property price reflects both the current market and the surrounding neighborhood, that home is more likely to go under agreement at a favorable price.) Motivated buyers might also submit a price that’s too good to refuse. Finally, a fear of rising mortgage rates — rates tend to go up in the spring — might cause a buyer to be more willing to pay a higher price upfront. Whatever the reason, it’s a happy discovery for many people who finalize a home sale when the weather outside is frightGame Notes L.A vs EDM

- OK, I admit it, the Oilers got snowed under by a contender, but I liked the effort.
Brilliant chances early, but by game’s end, that was probably the toughest game McDavid has played. Then again, if the refs called holding, interference, and hooking, he probably would have drawn six penalties. But … it’s the Kings. We already know going in it’ll never happen.

Fast Start Fuels Trojans
The E/B Trojans got off to a quick start versus the Havana Ducks on
Friday, scoring on the second play of the game on a Nate McFadden
interception return for a touchdown, their first offensive play, a Cody
Black 60 yard touchdown run and Havana's second punt attempt with Ben
Schmitt, blocking & recovery in the end zone. Putting the Trojans up 20-0 half-way through the first quarter.
The Trojans matched their first quarter effort in the second, with a Clayton Powers run up the middle for a touchdown (9 yards), a Ben Schmitt reception from Dax Feuchter for a touchdown (25 yards), and a another interception return from McFadden for 80 yard as the time expired.
The Trojans scored in the third quarter on a Nate McFadden run, bringing their total to 47 for the night.
The Trojans' numbers on the night were quite impressive. Offensively,
they gained 241 yards on the ground in 24 carries & 3 TDs. Out of the two Trojans passes, one went for a TD. Defensively, they produced two interceptions for touchdowns (Nate McFadden, 110 total yards), and limited the Ducks to 174 total yards (31 rushes for 119 yards, 17 passes, 8 receptions for 55 yards). The Trojans special teams produced a touchdown (punt block), and 5 of 7 on PAT attempts (Nate McFadden).
Credit must be given to the young Havana Ducks team. Undaunted by the
Trojans' maelstrom of the early first quarter, the Ducks drove the length of the field and punched in a touchdown of their own before the end of the first period (Kyle Davenport reception). The Ducks repeated with a long drive in the fourth quarter (Alex Bergman run).
The 2004 Ducks are much improved from the 2003 season, and will undoubtedly end up on the right side of the victory column by the end of the year.

A person may be injured in many different ways. One of the most common ways in which a person is harmed is through a car accident caused by the negligence of another person. However, there are many other types of events where the actions of a third-party lead to devastating injuries. The attorneys at the Law Offices of Chad M. Hayward, P.C. provide experienced, aggressive litigation services to injured clients. Our attorneys have significant experience representing injured parties who have been hurt in an accident due to the negligence of another party. We focus on the following areas of personal injury law:
- Wrongful death – One of the worst things that a family can experience is the loss of a loved one as the result of the negligent or reckless actions of another person or company. In order to recover damages for this devastating loss, it is necessary to have the right person bring the legal action. It is critical to present ample evidence of the financial and emotional devastation caused by the loss of the victim;
- Transportation liability – Motor vehicle accidents are among the most common of personal injury cases. People are severely injured or killed on Illinois roads every day. Although some of these accidents are caused by manufacturer’s defects or mechanical failure, the vast majority of vehicle accidents are caused by operator error. It is crucial to develop a strong case in order to recover the compensation that a victim needs to move forward with his life;
- Premises liability – When a person is an invitee in a private or public property, there is an expectation that the premises will be maintained in a safe manner. If there has been a breach in the duty to provide a safe place, it is possible to hold the property owner or manager liable for the resulting harm. In order to succeed in this type of action, it is necessary to demonstrate that the property owner knew or should have known about the defect or safety hazard;
- Nursing home abuse – This is one of the most pernicious types of abuse, where a loved one has been entrusted to a residential or care facility and there is a breach of duty and devastating harm. When a nursing home has hired the wrong people, failed to maintain the premises, or provided negligent care, it is necessary to hold the responsible parties accountable for the harm that they caused;
- Product liability – There may be dangerous defects caused by the design or manufacture of products that reach the consumer and lead to serious harm. Product liability cases include medical devices and medications, as well as defective car parts, among many other types of dangerous items that are placed into the marketplace. These cases require experienced attorneys and careful preparation in order to get the results that victims need to move forward after the harm suffered;
- Toxic tort – A person suffers from this type of injury when he is exposed to a toxic substance and suffers harm as a result. Usually, a toxic tort case is brought against a company that knowingly causes employees or the public to come in contact with the toxic substance;
- Construction liability – Workplace accidents happen everywhere from the sales floor of a retail company to the offices of a small company. However, construction sites are one of the most common locations for a work-related injury. These injuries may result from unsafe work conditions or defective equipment. These cases require careful analysis because of the complications of workers’ compensation laws. However, it may be possible to bring a legal action depending on the nature of the negligence and whether third-parties were partially or wholly responsible for the harm; and
- Medical malpractice – In order to maintain a medical malpractice case, it is necessary to demonstrate that the medical provider failed to meet the standard of care that other medical providers would have exercised under the same circumstances.
In order to succeed in a personal injury case, it is necessary to demonstrate that the other party owed a duty of care to the person injured in the accident. There must be evidence that shows that the party breached that duty, which was the direct and proximate cause of the injuries suffered by the victim. Finally, there must be actual harm that was suffered. The skilled attorneys at the Law Offices of Chad M. Hayward, P.C. understand how to build an effective case in order to get the results that our clients deserve.
Whether you have been injured in a car accident, slip and fall injury at work, or nursing home abuse, we can help. We are paid only when we recover compensation for you.

I was so tempted to just sew all these together but I really would prefer to do that after I have had a chance to arrange them on the design wall. And I decided to go completely random with the corner triangles so I need to be able to arrange those as well. But here is a preview of how a block will look.
Isn't it pretty. And I couldn't help showing off those stripes all going in the same direction! I will wait to share the rest of the blocks til next week when we put them together.
And just for fun I thought I would share what my design wall looks like right now. My random bright sampler and my Aiming for Accuracy Quilt Along blocks.
Sorry for the blurry photo. My new sewing room is working out well but sadly it is impossible to get a straight shot of the design wall. Most of this comes down tomorrow morning so I can use it to assemble a quilt that I am pattern testing for my son. Hope to share that soon!
Happy Stitching!

Wow, I am so impressed with those directional prints. That is amazing!! I knew this was a big job this week which is another reason as to why we didn't attach them :) I can't wait to see yours all come together. They look incredible!!
Looks fabulous!
I love those star surround blocks. Your design wall is full of fabulous blocks. I practically have to sit on my cutting bench to get a full shot of my design wall, so I know how you feel. It's great to hear your sewing room is working well
Your Star Surround blocks are great! Your design wall blocks are pretty too! You are one busy lady!
I love everything on your design wall!
I have not commented in quite a while but I have been hopping over to your blog and watching your start on this quilt. It is going to be a wonderful project.How are characters, other than Jesus, portrayed in the film "The Last Temptation of Christ" by Martin Scorsese?
- print Print
- list Cite
Martin Scorsese's adaptation of "The Last Temptation of Christ" is based on the book by the same name by Nikos Kazantzakis. It does not portray Jesus accurately according to the Bible, so it is not surprising to discover that the other characters in the film are not accurately portrayed according to scripture.
Mary and Joseph are Jesus's earthly parents, and we know very little about them from the Bible. We know they were engaged, had to deal with an immaculate conception, got married, and had Jesus, their first child. After that, we do not meet them again until Jesus is twelve and teaching in the temple, and, in at least one of the Gospels, Mary is at the foot of the cross. When his family loses Jesus. they have to go back and find him, and everyone in the temple knows he is the son of the carpenter of Nazareth (Matthew 13).
In this movie, Joseph is helplessly disabled, and that is not in any way depicted in the Bible. Mary is depicted as a rather shrewish mother who would rather have an earthly son and grandchildren than the Son of God. These are wholesale fabrications which are not in alignment with the little we do know about Jesus's parents.
Judas is probably the most egregious example of a character in this move who is not portrayed according to what is found in scripture. In this film, Judas treats Jesus with great disrespect. While we are not privy to many conversations between Judas and Jesus in the Bible, we do know that he was a follower, a disciple, and assume he would not have been blatantly disrespectful to his teacher.
Note this exchange between Jesus and Judas in which Peter tries to scold Judas....."
In this exchange, Peter and Jesus look weak while Judas appears strong. This is a ridiculous notion, as Peter is the foundation, the rock, on which the church is built after Jesus's death (Matthew 16:18). Jesus did not beg Judas or anyone else to betray him, nor did he need Judas to help him get to the cross, as the movie declares.
In the movie, Saul should rightly be called Paul after his encounter with God on the road to Damascus (Acts 9), another denial of the transformative power of God in the lives of man.
Almost as bad as the flawed or outright fictional accounts of characters who can actually be found in the Bible are the characters which have been added to the film. Angels, women, and other rather ridiculous creatures all appear, many times in the odd dreams/visions this fictional Jesus has in the movie.
It is important for anyone who watches this movie to understand that this is one man's (Scorsese's) interpretation of one man's (Kazantzakis's) interpretation of the Bible. No film such as this is likely to be considered accurate by everyone, given the subject matter; however, this movie blatantly disregards the Bible both in detail and, it seems to me, in doctrine.FireAttack
Gas in sewers can come from a number of sources,
including natural gas, propane, gasoline, sewage, and
electrical cable burnout. The utility company can
assist in identifying the type of gas involved and in
tracing its source.
Do not attempt to extinguish flames if gas becomes
ignited. Establish a hot zone around the opening,
and keep vehicles and bystanders away from nearby
manhole covers. Prohibit smoking and other potential
sources of ignition.
Do not open manhole covers to investigate without
consulting utility employees with specific expertise.
Opening a manhole cover with a smoldering fire
underneath can give similar results to opening the
front door of a building with an oxygen-starved fire
smoldering inside—presenting a backdraft situation.
Always test the atmosphere of a manhole, vault, or
sewer, first for oxygen levels and then for flammable
gases, carbon monoxide, and hydrogen sulfide.
Firefighters should not enter manholes, vaults, or sewers—leave that to utility personnel specifically trained
to do so. In no case should anyone be allowed to
enter a manhole if dangerous concentrations of gases
or vapors are known or suspected and, if personnel
enter, they must follow specific confined space entry
procedures. At underground gas events, do not work
or park over manhole covers/openings.
Check the basements of adjoining buildings for any
evidence of gas intrusion. If found, ventilate by opening windows and doors. Shut off open flame devices,
and do not operate electrical switches. If natural gas is
involved, handle as suggested in the section on escaping gas in buildings.
When fire personnel must enter manholes, vaults,
or sewers for rescue operations, follow confined space
procedures.
When under control, natural gas, like many other
hazardous materials, is harmless. Natural gas is widely
used for heating and air conditioning, water heating,
cooking, incineration, drying, power generation, and
many other commercial purposes in hotels, restaurants, schools, and many other occupancies. Natural
gas is also widely used for thousands of industrial
purposes every day. How we respond to emergencies involving this equipment can mean the difference between life and death for civilians as well as
emergency responders. Having access to meters that
are properly maintained/calibrated with personnel
properly trained in their use is critical, as is having
standard operating guidelines for response to gas
emergencies.
Ensuring prompt notification of the utilitycompany, isolating potential ignition sources,metering the immediate area and other areas wherethe gas could migrate, eliminating ignition sources(the utility company may need to cut electric powerto the building for this), evacuating the area,establishing a hot zone (both explosion and collapse),ventilating the building as appropriate, and havingrapid intervention crews available will keep bothcivilians and emergency responders safe. Contact yourlocal utility company to determine what training itcan provide on natural gas emergencies. Learningshould never stop.

Semi-AnnualBrake pads may contain asbestos which has been known to cause cancer. It's a very good idea to wear a mask or respirator. While changing your brake pads may not create enough asbestos dust to lodge into your lungs and bring about cancer, it is better safe than sorry. The brake system is made up of a caliper which holds the brake pads. The brake pads press against the brake rotors and slow the rotation of the wheels. The master cylinder pumps brake fluid to actuate the pads applying pressure to the rotors. Over time the brake pads wear down. There are sensors which send a signal indicating wear to the point of replacement. Replacing the brake pads is straight forward.
There are a few ways one can replace the front brake pads. This is a quick method that replaces the pads only without having to take off the calipers. Depending upon the model, you may have one of three types of calipers; Teves (ATE), Bendix (BX) or Girling (found typically on the rear axle).
The wheel must be taken off prior to replacing the brake pads. You'll need to jack up your car and put jack stands under it. Please refer to our article on safely jacking up your 450SL.
Turn the wheel out so that the brake calipers are easy to get to. If you are changing the passenger's side front wheel brake pad, turn the wheel to the right. This will provide greater access to the pads.at the end of the day, there will be some conolidation – but selling audience ratehr than content channel does make sense, especially if teh ad networks can geta wide enough set of people.
from paid content
Over the past few years, a number of major publishers have sworn off remnant ad networks, often citing the lack of transparency and fear of driving down premium prices as the reason for their avoidance. But as a Mediaweek piece shows, online pubs like WSJ.com, Bloomberg.com and TheStreet.com, which all claim to withhold inventory from ad nets, are claiming that interCLICK—which bills itself as the “transparent ad network”—is selling space on their sites without authorization. InterCLICK, however, sees it differently.
According to interCLICK, it is able to sell inventory on those sites because the publishers make their inventory available through ad optimizers like The Rubicon Project and AdMeld or through Google (NSDQ: GOOG) DoubleClick’s display sales platform. InterCLICK then buys the ad space from the optimizers and resells it. In the case of the WSJ.com’s inventory, interCLICK says it initially accessed it through the DoubleClick exchange.
While that seems like a loophole, publishers insist that there shouldn’t be one. Some pubs accuse interCLICK and its peers of falsifying reports designed to obscure unauthorized ad buys that have been made on those sites. Some of the ad nets, like Undertone and Tribal Fusion say that sometimes “mistakes” slip through their respective systems and some inventory from TheStreet.com (NSDQ: TSCM) was inadvertently sold.
In addition to issuing a stream of cease and desist orders, publishers are now pushing for wider use of third party auditors and ad delivery monitors, like DoubleVerify and AdSafe. Mediaweek adds that interCLICK just happened to start working with both those systems.

Let me start off by saying… I can’t stand Umbrellas!! Maybe... it’s the City girl in me. I don’t really know. I just want to get where I am going, and fast! Umbrella’s hinder that.
Or should I say the lame a$$e$ that carry them!
Why must you poke me? Why do you think...
You+Umbrella= The Whole Damn Sidewalk??!!!
Seriously… did you not see my Solo a$$ scurrying along the sidewalk, in my lane might I add?????
Nooooo, you have to interrupt my portion of the Walk way, Jab me ruthlessly, and then keep on walking like I invaded your space!!
What’s even worse… are those inconsiderate jerks that dayum near take your eye out, then turn and inspect their Umbrella while you obviously need medical attention!! WTH?!!
Umbrella: I do not like you!
Umbrella People: I dislike you even more!
Now I know how bikers feel in the bike lane. It’s like Cars have the whole dang Highway and you really need to intrude on a tiny path that’s not yours? WTH?!!
Sometimes, just sometimes in a dreadful downpour a little shelter is okay... just when you think Umbrella People are inconsiderate and selfish they suprise you. You know the ones..those folks that say... “Oh dear you are getting soaked would you like to share my Umbrella?” Nice right? WRONG!!!
How is this sharing when they proceed to hog the whole dayum thing, jab you repeatedly, and then not even walk you to your destination.. it usually ends with.. “oh here’s my car, good luck stay dry!” WTH??? It reminds me of those people that honk and wave when you are walking down the street. Seriously... no offer for a ride? I'd rather you pretend you didn't see me then honk and wave!
Umbrella’s in the City Suck. They definitely need a designated A$$hole with an
Umbrella Lane or a Special "I'm a Jerk" Sidewalk.

He He... such a funny post- I'm anti umbrella too. I can't imagine juggling that along with the three kids. If I manage to be without the crew, you'll probably find my walking with my face up to greet the raindrops.
Friday Follower!
Thanks for following me! I am now following you from Friday Follow!
LOL. Remind me to never bring an umbrella around you.
Woohoo! Thanks for linking up at Friday Follow. I am already following and stopping over to say hello. Happy Friday Follow!

Thank you for the follow. I am now following back. have a great friday
If you're gonna umbrella, you need to share. End of story. Yes, I made umbrella a verb.
I only use an umbrella if it's a huge downpour. Usually I just walk briskly because I'm not going to be out too long. I can't get away from the laptop for too long! (jk)
I your newest follower, btw.
Happy Friday Follow! Glad I found you. :)
haha love it! my favorite is when my boyfriend offers to share the umbrella with me, and my whole half ends up soaked because we both don't fit under the tiny thing. I'd rather just get my coat wet!
Just stopping by to say hello. I followed you last week. Hope you have an amazing weekend.

This is hysterical! And you're so right! These people who offer to share, don't!
:)
You are right! It is impossible to share an umbrella!
Happy Friday Follow!
I agree with you about those pesky umbrellas..it is rainy right now...but I live in coastal California...we don't need umbrellas much.

Umbrellas are just bothersome period. I'd sooner get wet than deal with the nuisance of an umbrella. I'm not made of sugar - I won't melt.

My job is to help you be healthy and, hopefully, happy. Unfortunately, sometimes helping you improve or maintain your health makes you unhappy. Let me explain.
Case number one involves a patient who has multiple medical issues, all of which would be improved or eliminated by significant weight loss and lifestyle changes. Over the last decade, I have spent a lot of time teaching my patient about the benefits of diet and exercise, instructing my patient in the “how to” of changing their life around and using every tool I could muster to no avail. My patient’s health is deteriorating and today I gave my patient the bad news: she had almost reached the point of no return. She was not happy! In order to stave off the inevitable, she was going to have to change radically or learn to be chronically ill. To help her find her way back to health, I had to be brutally honest, all the while knowing I might drive her out of my practice.
Case number two is the most common problem of all. My patients want antibiotics! No matter how much time I spend teaching about the differences between viral infections and bacterial infections, there are many patients who feel cheated and uncared for if they don’t get an antibiotic. Antibiotics are not your friends. When appropriate, they are a necessary evil. They come with host of possible side effects, some of which can be worse than the disease they are being used to treat. Despite all of medical science’s pleas and protocols revolving around the proper use of antibiotics, my patients feel cheated when they don’t get one.
The frustrating fact is that it takes me 3 minutes to prescribe an antibiotic and have my make my patients happy, and 10 minutes to explain why I’m not giving them an antibiotic and make my patients unhappy! Yes, by doing the wrong thing I gain your praise as a great doc; and, by doing the right thing, I get branded as a “bad” doc who just “doesn’t listen to his patients.” Sometimes, I just can’t win. Luckily, you can. I’ll take the bum rap, do the right thing and help you be healthy even if you aren’t happy!I am trying to update an older cinder project (0.8.3) and move from running 3 screens with a Matrox to running 3 screens with one computer. Looking at the multi window it seems fairly easy to spawn three windows all fullscreen and I assume assign them to different screens? Second question is if I can setup one 3D scene and have each screen render it from a different camera so I can then project the three as one seamless view? I am trying to determine feasibility before diving in so any advice is deeply appreciated.
Multiwindow, same scene but different cameras?
What’s the graphics card? You’ll have a much simpler time if you can manage to use the drivers to make a virtual desktop that spans multiple displays. I’ve been using NVidia Mosaic for this, which requires something in the Quadro series, but I believe there is something similar with GTX cards too (Surround, maybe?).
Other than that, you can also manually size just one window to span all three displays, and make it borderless, but this doesn’t work near as nice as a fullscreen app with one window.
If you have multiple windows, you’ll have multiple gl contexts, so handling resources across the three of them becomes more complicated.
cheers,
Rich
Thank you for the feedback! I am trying to pull this off on an early 2013 MBP with an NVIDIA GT 650M. On top of that, MacOS is going to limit the use of the good drivers.
This is the route I will try, but why do you say this is not as nice?
What about the tactic of rendering to one large FBO and then each display/window uses a piece of it?
Hi,
I have been away from Cinder for a while, busy with other stuff, so forgive me in advance if it’s not working, but I have a sample that does what you want:
At the very least, you could have a look at it for ideas. It’s pretty easy to render the same scene in multiple windows, but you’ll have to understand that you’re going to do the same work multiple times and performance will be an issue. Make sure to draw the least amount of polygons by performing culling where possible. I don’t think culling is part of the sample, but you’ll find some culling code in the samples that come with Cinder. Let us here on the forum know if you have more questions.
-Paul
Edit: Rich’s suggestion to use proper hardware is the better way of doing things. If that proves impossible or too expensive, try rendering to an
Fbo first, then copying the correct portion to each window. The solution in the sample above should actually be your last resort. But it might be of interest nonetheless.
Problem with rendering to a single
Fbo first is that it requires more memory and, additionally, you can’t share the
Fbo across each of the window’s graphic contexts. However, you can share the actual texture used by the
Fbo.
One small thing, OSX by default enforces a window to belong to a specific display, so calling
getWindow()->spanAllDisplays() won’t work unless you disable this setting.Cheap Home Insurance in Heart Butte MT

Now for everybody who knows me, I have been very much under the radar since the beginning of the year. Not because there hasnt been things going on, but I always have a period of time in the winter where I prefer getting all my thoughts together and figure out what the new year is going to bring for me. It is also the time where I work on getting all my sponsorships in place, so that I can continue living out my dream job for the future years to come. Obviously the first big news for me, that didnt require the biggest of sharing, was that I will be working closely together with Simmer Sails for another year, which makes me super happy. These guys have been there for me since the beginning and I really feel like home with this brand, so I hope that our great relationship continues for years to come.
Now for the next big news, I have joined the board brand Fanatic for the upcoming season which is a very big deal for me, as I will be leaving the brand that helped me coming up, Angulo boards. As sad as it is leaving these guys, we are still on the same level, and I wish nothing but the best for Angulo boards for the many next years.
Having said that, I am very ready for new challenges, and I think that I have truly found another brand that I can identify myself with. I have always had a look over to the Fanatic guys, as I always saw them as having a great team and good atmosphere which for me is very important. I am super happy to welcome new times with new people, and to be moving in a new direction.
Now taking this decision was far from easy for me. First of all. I was super comfortable where I was, so leaving was not as easy as I expected. Furthermore there were several players in this changing game, and suddenly taking decision became much harder, which set me back a bit, but after lots of turmoil I had to follow my heart, and I felt a connection between the values that Fanatic represent as a brand and my own personal profile which I could se making a good match for the future.
Now with everything in place, I am looking forward to a season which I feel is going to be great. I feel like I have had a good start of the year, and so far I feel pretty comfortable with what I have done. With a busy tour schedule to come this year, I feel its important that I have managed to get an earlier start than usual, and of course I hope to be able to keep up the same pace for the next few months before the first events start.
My time in the new year, I have spent on Maui, which has turned out to be great. Lots of windsurfing, SUP, surfing and so on. I have simply taken what I have and moved it all to Maui for now, where I feel like I can concentrate on getting some hours on the water and generally stay focused on the things that I need to do without too many distractions.
For now all seems good and I hope to be able to keep up the same level of motivation for the upcoming months. Until then,,, aloha to everyone.

Nicola Sturgeon has said she will be able to make a judgment on whether to back a second referendum on Scottish independence by the end of this year.
The first minister said her decision would be made when the shape of a deal between Britain and the European Union became clear in the autumn.
Her comments come ahead of the publication of a Scottish government assessment on the impact of Brexit.
The UK government has accused the SNP of trying to undermine the Brexit vote.
The SNP delayed plans for a new vote on independence following the loss of 21 MPs in last year’s general election.
Speaking on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Programme, the first minister said that people wanted to see clarity on the future relationship between the UK and Europe.
- Study suggests Brexit pessimism increasing
- Brexit: All you need to know
- SNP calls on Labour to keep UK in single market
- Sturgeon puts referdendum bill on hold
She added: “At that point, what I’ve said is that we will look at that and determine at that stage if Scotland should then have the right to choose between whatever that new relationship with the UK is going to be or choosing to be an independent country.”
When asked if the timetable would be between October and the end of 2018, Ms Sturgeon responded: “That’s when I will be able to look at that and make a judgement about what the next appropriate steps are for Scotland, and I will then report that to the Scottish Parliament and to the people of Scotland.”
‘Democratic referendum’
She was challenged to acknowledge that a decision to hold a second referendum then would not leave enough time for the independence vote before the UK’s planned withdrawal from the EU in March 2019.
Ms Sturgeon said: “We’ll make decisions on timing when we get to that point and look at that.”
Her comments on independence prompted criticism from her political opponents.
Conservative MP John Lamont said: “Yet again, Nicola Sturgeon would rather focus on indyref2 than deal with the crises she has created in both health and education.
“Nicola Sturgeon has no interest in securing a successful Brexit deal, all she cares about is a second independence referendum.”
Ms Sturgeon was speaking as the Scottish government prepares to publish their assessment of the impact of Brexit on the Scottish economy.
The first minister is adamant that Scotland should remain in the European Union single market and customs union after Brexit.
She said she believed that a majority in the House of Commons wanted to stay in the single market, including those in the Labour Party, who needed to “get their act together”.
The paper will detail the potential impact on Scotland’s GDP, trade and its potential to attract talent from out with the country.
However, the UK government has already ruled out remaining part of the market.
The customs union is the European Union’s tariff-free trading area, which imposes the same taxes on imports from certain countries outside the EU.

The single market also includes the free movement of goods, services, capital and people..
Henry VIII powers.Want to Attract More Customers? Make Your Marketing All About Them!Posted by stevesmith56
Oct 28
When we think of finding and attracting customers, we tend to think of the relationship from our own perspective. After all, it’s what we offer that makes them want to do business with us, right? Wrong! Consumers today have more choices of whom to do business with and what to select from than ever before. And with everyone holding on to their money so tightly these days, the usual marketing approaches have become mostly ineffective when it comes to attracting customers that want what you have and are willing to pay you your asking price.
Attracting customers is not a new problem:
Since commerce began, entrepreneurs and business owners have resorted to a variety of sales tactics and promotional gimmicks to lure potential customers to their place of business. Not surprisingly, consumers eventually figure out these methods and become indifferent to offers of special discounts, creative pricing strategies, frequent shopper programs, and other limited time offers. Add to this, the sheer number of merchants doing the same thing and you have a consumer that grows numb because they simply don’t see the need to purchase or feel they really want what you sell at the time you want to sell it.
Attracting customers means seeing things their way:
Small business owners are a proud and resilient bunch! Most have worked very hard and sacrificed enormously to have the business that many times bares their name, regardless if it’s deemed a success or not. They therefore, tend to view all reasons for doing business with them from their point of view: ‘We’re honest’; ‘We’ve been in business 30 years’; ‘Our customers love us’: ‘We have the lowest prices’, etc., etc. While all these statements may be true, they have little effect on enticing people to decide to patronize a particular business. The reason? The customer only thinks about one thing ‘WIIFM’- What’s In It For Me! All the above statements are features that benefit the business owner. As consumers, we are drawn to businesses that promote things we want first. Read more

Clearly I am not a doctor because I have zero patience.
This blog post (well the text anyway, not the actual posting because of the lack of Internet access) comes to you from seat 10A of American Eagle Flight 3930 with service to Omaha. Let me tell you about my experience with American Eagle Flight 3930 with service to Omaha. I left a meeting early to make it to O’Hare in time to catch American Eagle Flight 3930 with service to Omaha which was departing at 4:55 p.m. Checked in, made it through security, grabbed a bottled water and yogurt parfait and sat down at my gate with about 20 minutes ‘til boarding time. I made a few phone calls, sent a handful of emails, and looked up at the screen expecting it to be time to board. Instead we were delayed five minutes. “No biggie,” I thought to myself. I people watch and hang out for a few more minutes. Then an announcement comes on the American Eagle Flight 3930 with service to Omaha had a change of gates and we would not be boarding downstairs at gate G14. Again – no biggie. I head downstairs and we’re delayed now until 5:15 p.m. Okay. Send a few more emails (blackberries are life-savers in boring situations like this) and then decide it’s time to crack into the yogurt parfait. I finish the yogurt parfait. I get up and walk around. I grab a new seat. I hear “this is a gate change notification for American Eagle Flight 3930 with service to Omaha. You will now be boarding out of Gwhatever upstairs.” Lots of people moan. I feel like moaning, but it could be worse I tell myself. This O’Hare AND American Airlines and we’re getting out of here with only a 20 minute delay. Not too bad.
Make that a 35 minute delay. Oh wait 40 minute delay. Oh, it’s been five more minutes? Time to update the departure time. Guess what; we’re now departing at 6 p.m.! I skim through a Cooking Light. I call Grandma. I go tinkle. I browse Hudson News. I come back and we’re now leaving at 6:30. I get mad.
I was supposed to LAND in Omaha at 6:25 p.m. I send a few more emails. They make an announcement that our plane has left Rochester, Minnesota and is en route. At this point, do I really care that the plane just left? I think it might add fuel to the annoyance fire.
We boarded American Eagle Flight 3930 with service to Omaha at 6:50 p.m. But not so fast says the captain – we need to get de-iced which will take 15 minutes. What he neglected to say was 15 minutes from the time they start de-icing OUR plane and since O’Hare apparently only has ONE de-icing machine, we’d be sitting there for about 30 more minutes.
Phew. There’s movement. Holy cow I think this plane is moving! “Ladies and gentleman, we’ve been cleared for take-off,” the captain says. “We’re fifth in line.”I looked at my watch and when we started ascending it was 7:45 p.m. Nearly three hours AFTER I was supposed to land in Omaha. I could have almost flown to Chicago and back to Omaha in the time I sat sitting in the damn airport and idle on American Eagle Flight 3930 with service to Omaha. I could have done almost five 30-minute sessions of cardio – more than I do in a week! – in the time I was sitting in the damn airport and idle on American Eagle Flight 3930 with service to Omaha.
And I think that’s the part that annoys me the most. I HATE sitting and doing nothing. I am happy and content and at peace when I am doing something. Anything. But not just sitting.
I realize there are a lot of factors that play into air traffic. I do. But riddle me this. There was slush on the ground in Chicago and apparently a quarter inch of snow in Omaha. Why the almost THREE hour delay? If I booked a flight to leave Chicago at 7:45 p.m., I would have been FINE. But this was out of my control and screwing up my schedule. And I do not like my schedule screwed with.
I do a decent amount of traveling for work and I enjoy it. I am not complaining about that at all (and I am not just saying that because there are Barkley peeps that read this). I really don’t mind it. But when three useless hours are tacked on to your day – I don’t care if you’re traveling for business or for pleasure – it’s frustrating.
Sidenote: the cabin attendant just came by with the drink cart and oh how a beer sounds good. I decided if I was a pilot and MY passengers were delayed, I’d buy them all a around. But that’s just me.
So, new year’s resolution number four is to keep track of my travel for 2008. (This is the first trip which makes me a little nervous if this is any indication of my air travel adventures for the next 323 days.) On this blog, this very blog you are reading, I am going to keep track of my trips. I’m going to record the airports, the airlines and the departure times and we’ll get something out of this. We’ll see just how much time was wasted in one year sitting in airports unplanned. We’ll see if there is any correlation between airlines with delays (cough cough American) and others. We’ll just see. I really wish I could import Excel into a blog but I don’t think I can. So, here goes – my first entry for the year:
Wednesday, Jan. 23
American (Eagle) Airlines
Depart Omaha: On-Time
Wednesday, Jan. 23
American (Eagle) Airlines
Depart Chicago O’Hare: 2 hours 50 minutes late
So, there you have it folks. And I know everyone gets delayed. My colleague traveling with me today had her flight cancelled and she was mysteriously put on another one, thank goodness. She was delayed, too. I’m just fed up and it is therapeutic for me to share my frustrations.
Woo. I feel better. And no I did not buy a drink. I just vented. And now, I have a few other things I’d like to touch on in this post.
1. My desire to build even more parking lots. Guess where I parked this morning at Eppley? In a snow bank. I drove around the garage for 20 minutes and started panicking that I was going to be late so I just parked in what should have been a stall but wasn’t thanks to the wonderful snow plowing, so I rammed my Jeep into the snow bank as far as I could and called it good. I’m sure if I would have put it in 4-Wheel Drive it would have helped but I was also slightly concerned about driving OVER the side of the parking garage. A six-story fall in my Jeep was not in today’s agenda. So, the airport charges $12 a day to park. So, even if I lowered the rate (gotta be competitive you know) to $10 a day and had 100 stalls (to keep it in line with the parking lot I am building near UNO) I’d make $1,000 a day or $365,000 a year. You can add a grand to leap years. With that disposable income (cause of course I’d still work at Barkley; the parking lots would just be a side gig), I’d buy a plane and I think you know why.
2. Lastly, I just wanted to give you an update on my resolutions for this year (not including the one I just established today).
a. Church: We’re one for three (Sundays). The first Sunday we were in Lincoln so that doesn’t really count. The second Sunday we went. Last Sunday I drank too many Coronas the night before and didn’t eat enough dinner and just couldn’t quite make it. I have faith (ha!) we’ll go this Sunday though
b. Fruit or veggies with every meal. I’m definitely working on it and am doing okay. Last night my dinner was Blue Bunny Premium Light Double Strawberry ice cream cause I was a little stressed. Does that count as a fruit? Okay, okay – I need to work on that one.
c. Be financially responsible. I am doing very well on this one! I don’t even look at JCrew.com’s sale or go close to the mall. I’m making this budget work!
And with that, it’s time for me to turn off my approved electronic device and enjoy the ride. Hope you enjoyed the read.

A new list for the new year
In keeping with my list theme, here's a great article I wanted to share. Trevor actually found this on CNN.com on Monday. Gotta love that the company payin' my bills leads the list!
Great work perks
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Some employers are offering lavish perks like posh vacations
Employers want perks that offer a way to make life easier for their employees
Perks can create a stronger tie between the employee and the company
By Rachel Zupek
Editor's note: CNN.com has a business partnership with CareerBuilder.com, which serves as the exclusive provider of job listings and services to CNN.com.
Where can you grab a cold beer from the company keg when the clock strikes four? Where can you take in a yoga class during your lunch hour? And where can you do laundry for free?
At work, that's where.
Years ago, such generous benefits were better fit for a utopian dream than real workplaces.Nowadays, while competitive salaries and advancement opportunities still rank high on the list of job priorities, lavish perks like posh vacations, gourmet cafeterias and concierge services are inching their way up the importance scale.
Employers want perks that offer a way to make life easier for their employees, says Rosemary Haefner, vice president of human resources for CareerBuilder.com.
By taking care of chores employees either dislike or don't have time for, employers create a stronger emotional tie between the employee and the company, as well as increase productivity and retention.
"Employers realize the best way to retain prized employees among the current talent crunch is to make them want to stay, often through first-rate perks," Haefner says. "In addition to the standard comprehensive benefits package, some companies are taking things a step further, offering unique perks to keep current employees happy and new employees eager to stick around."
The company perks we came across ran the gamut from widespread to unique to downright unfair.
Check out how companies, big and small, across the country are keeping their employees happy.
1. Barkley; Kansas City, Missouri- Great perks: This advertising agency has an annual "Kidnap Day," when the company shuts down for the day and workers are taken to an undisclosed location, like an arcade.Additionally, there are break-time activities, like pool and ping-pong tournaments, and free Boulevard beer on tap after 4 p.m. To top it off, employees are given birthdays off (with $25 spending money); on-site yoga; and a rooftop observation deck with gardens, Wi-Fi access and barbecue grills.
2. SAS; Cary, North CarolinaGreat perks: Along with amenities like an on-site hair salon, massage therapy and car detailing, this software company also features subsidized day care centers and a free on-site healthcare center, complete with doctors, nurse practitioners and nutritionists.
3. Homestead Technologies; Menlo Park, CaliforniaGreat perks: Talk about time off: Employees earn paid winter breaks from Christmas to New Year's Day; paid days off for birthdays; unlimited paid sick leave; and after five years with the company, a four-week sabbatical earning two-thirds of their salary.They also receive $100 gift cards for their birthdays, an all-expenses-paid retreat each year and use of a cabin in Lake Tahoe during the ski season (for a small fee to rent).
4. VistaPrint; Lexington, MassachusettsGreat perks: Employees who have been with this graphic design and custom-printing company for five years have the chance to take a one month, paid sabbatical -- to do whatever they please.
5. Creative Business Resources (CBR); Phoenix, ArizonaGreat perks: In addition to regular holiday bonuses in 2006, employees at CBR, a human resource outsourcing company, got a surprise bonus: a $150 shopping spree after the holiday team lunch.Employees received cash and were told to return with receipts showing how they spent the money on themselves.
6. Goldman Sachs; New York, New YorkGreat perks: Employees who get married or register a domestic partnership get an extra week of vacation at this global investment banking, securities and investment management firm.
7. Google Inc.; Mountain View, CaliforniaGreat perks: To name a few: Employees receive up to $8,000 per year in tuition reimbursement; unlimited sick leave; 27 days of paid time off after one year; on-site conveniences like medical and dental facilities, oil changes, car washes, haircuts, free washers and dryers, and three (free) gourmet meals a day.No wonder this search engine firm was voted No.1 in Fortune's 2007 "100 Best Companies to Work For."
8. National Court Appointed Special Advocates Association; Seattle, WashingtonGreat perks: Workers enjoy a "bring your baby to work" policy, which allows employees to bring their newborns to work until they're 6 months old or for a total of three months.
9. Digitas Health; Philadelphia, PennsylvaniaGreat perks: Free gym memberships (including lunchtime yoga); "Beer Fridays" during the colder months to kick off the weekends; and summer hours on Fridays to get out and enjoy the weather.
10. San Francisco SPCA (Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals)Great perks: If dogs are well-behaved, employees can bring them to work; they're also allowed one day off when an animal companion dies.
11. KPMG; New York, New YorkGreat perks: Workers for this audit, tax and advisory firm earned a five-day weekend around the Fourth of July this year, with a "Barbecue Bonanza" gift of steaks, chicken, hot dogs and hamburgers.The firm also runs seasonal contests, like "Movie Madness" (around the Academy Awards) or the "Summer Vacation Photo Challenge." Prizes include big-screen TVs, iPods, Nintendos and travel vouchers.
12. Adams & Knight; Avon, ConnecticutGreat perks: Perks are in the environment at this advertising agency.The center of the building is a full-scale replica of a 1950s diner, complete with booths, a jukebox and a Coca-Cola machine (which spits out free bottles of Coke and Diet Coke). Halls are lined with original, restored ads from the '40s and '50s, and there's a 60-seat theater used as a meeting space for clients and staff.

Celebrating the New Year
Soil surveys have been conducted in Alberta for the past 70 years. Over the last 15 years the majority of soils information has been compiled at Survey Intensity Level 3 (SIL3) 1:50,000 map scale. Production of these maps is costly and requires large numbers of personnel. The Federal and Provincial governments are no longer prepared to financially support soil inventory at this level. This project was conducted to evaluate and compare alternative soil mapping methods (top-down and landscape mapping) in comparison to traditional SIL3 1:50,000 soil maps. Six townships were mapped and compiled at 1:50,000 and evaluated on the basis of cartometrics, map accuracy and time required to conduct mapping.
Cartometric analysis showed that the average sized polygon occupied 124 ha on SIL3 1:50,000 maps, 166 ha on landscape maps and approximately 190 ha on the top-down maps. Consequently, the soil maps produced by alternative methods had fewer polygons delineated per township than the SIL3 1:50,000 maps.
Map accuracy was defined as the degree of correspondence between the soils predicted by a map legend to occur at a given site and the soils found in the field. Results of the study show that top-down and landscape mapping methods had map accuracies similar to SIL3 1:50,000 maps. Map accuracies between methods were not statistically significantly different at the 95% confidence level. The landscape mapping method provided the highest map accuracy, followed by top-down and SIL3 1:50 000 mapping methods. Map accuracies of the various mapping methods were similar regardless of the amount of time spent in the field or the number of observations.
Analysis of the results leads to the conclusion that both the top-down and landscape mapping methods are viable alternatives to SIL3 1:50,000 mapping and should be employed in future soil mapping projects.

Maybe have a tournament of some kind. . .maybe a tic tac toe tournament where your child will challenge the champion. Or you could have the regular pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey, etc. Good luck!

If the ages vary so far try setting up activities that the older kids could enjoy helping the younger kids with. By doing this you can keep all of them busy and interested and maybe same yourself some trouble.
One thing you can consider is instead of a birthday party….how about a birthday breakfast or brunch? You can make “birthday” pancakes for the kids, top them with whipped cream, and your daughter can have candles on hers. Before and or afterwards you can have different games that they can play….and of course a pinata is always fun for the kids. If it’s warm where you live at, then you can also have a “slip-n-slide” party, at very minimal cost to you. Just lay out some Visqueen (plastic sheeting), open it up….get out the water hose and wet it very well, then put some mild dishwashing soap all over it (like Ivory). The kids will love it when they can run and slide on it. Just some ideas…….best of luck to you and have a good time with this.
hey heart? i have a question how can u make bubbles on those gel? just like
a beer one it has not so tiny bubbles inside.. thanks
thank you 🙂
why did u not use two wicks that was a large candle and wont burn evenly
like that. I find it easier to put the wickd in the bottom first that way
it will burn all the way to the bottom
can you use a tin pot for melting the gel?
wont the pine and berrys burn? if you turn it on
What kind of fragrance do u use? I bought some from the Dollar Tree and
when I poured a few drops in it the wax started boiling and ended up
boiling so much that it boiled over the entire pot. Do u have any
suggestions for me?
I did, and I will admit that a year later, the gel turned a funny color
(possibly from the pine cone and berries?), so I’d suggest using the full
candle within a year! haha 🙂
did you use real pine cones and berries, if you did, will they get yucky?
this is awesome!
What a simple and awesome video!!! Can we use artificial flowers in the
candle? I have seen such images online but not sure whether we can use them
or not.
what gel do you use ?Nimmo is a focus of the interrelationship between muscular tone and function and the central nervous system. Pain is a small part of the noxious stimuli (harmful or unwanted stresses the body perceives), resulting in only about 10% of overall nerve communication from our body to our brain and spinal cord. Ninety percent of noxious stimuli goes unnoticed but drives dysfunction and improper biomechanics, causing loss of movement and range of motion, as well as discomfort and disease states.
Through careful study and many years of training and clinical experience, Dr. Hamm is certified in NIMMOCARE, an approach to health that focuses on assessing the overall function of the body and its biomechanics. Through this diagnosis and treatment, he utilizes not only his expertise in intersegmental joint function, but also how the muscles, ligaments, and tendons play a very important role in our dysfunction, discomfort, and pain. Whenever a joint loses its normal and full range of motion, the added stresses that the joint surfaces endure, as well as the increased--and often improper--stresses that the adjacent joints face can lead to dysfunction, which causes to discomfort, disease states, and pain. Another factor leading to the loss of motion and increase in overall system dysfunction can be muscular and soft tissue stresses, which can cause an interruption of the proper neurologic reflex arc between the spinal cord (our central nervous system) and the supporting muscles, ligaments, and tendons. With NIMMOCARE’s approach to the dysfunction of our bodies in a matter that addresses all avenues of this dysfunction, the results have been astounding, consistent, and long-lasting.
Dr. Hamm examines, diagnoses, and treats each patient individually for these dysfunctions and is specific to each patient’s needs. NIMMOCARE is a foundational approach that allows Dr. Hamm to treat each patient as an entire system of causes and needs rather than only addressing the symptoms of dysfunction, such as pain or discomfort. Instead of placing a Band-Aid over our symptoms, this approach allows for treatment aimed at their cause and allows the body the opportunity to heal and function to its best possible ability.A picture I took in February 2007, to illustrate the difference in size between the plastic 1/72 scale SYW figures by Revell on the left and a metal 1/60 scale RSM95 Prussian grenadier, painted here as the famous Oberfeldwebel Klatschen, the most feared non-commissioned officer in the Army of Stollen. Why, it has been said that even the generals avoid tangling with him! While the difference in stature and stoutness between the two miniatures is readily apparent, you really don't notice that when they are deployed in large units on the table.

My Dear Prince Ulrich,
Are many of your regiments in plastic? Have you had occasion to mix plastic line figures with metal 20 mm lead command figures?
In any case your painting skills are excellent and your work commendable. Enjoy the winter weather and your well-deserved intersession. Have any of your students ever encountered your blog site?
All the very best,

I brought up the idea of making a list of what to buy to round out the ski rental plan as we are planning to head into town today for a change of scenery and a break from 1 week of straight skiing.
He told me that he has decided to withdraw his rental proposals.
I was dumbfounded. I had made up my mind to give it a go for a year and see what comes out of it.
He had already made contact with a local cleaning service and negotiated a fair rate. Insurance is in place -- the policy has been paid for. He has spent a lot of time developing the website and calling all sorts of places and people. We've even bought 4 sets of comfy cosy linens back home in anticipation.
His reasoning?
He feels that the rental idea is a good one. BUT, it wouldn't be a great idea for us. US meaning more ME as he doesn't relish the idea of having to handle ME if I were to come back into either space to discover that there is a scratch on the wall, stain on the mattress and the "energy" of the places have changed.
He thinks that I will end up selling the properties because I will feel that they were no longer mine. And right now, we don't HAVE to rent them.
I cannot deny that I would have a cow if I found a red wine stain on my off white sofas at the cottage (it is decorated in a "Hampton" beach style"). AND I cannot deny that I am very sensitive to how places "feel" and how different people can affect the energy of a place -- even people I like.
On a positive note, we have learned a lot about the process and found out that neither insurance policy we had in place were ideal (even from a non rental perspective).
There are newer policies available we didn't know about -- policies that are more specific to cottages and ski condos. The upgrade to the more niche policies will cost about $450 more a year total for both properties.
I love that he knows me so well to know how I would be but I cannot help but feel like some high maintenance chick -- am still getting over the shock of his position.
Middle Way,
I think D is just too sweet. You've found yourself a keeper. Sit back, relax, and enjoy being with such a wonderful man! And enjoy your spotless, perfect homes too. What a deal!
Does that mean you have decided not to rent or that you're still mulling it over? Can you get back the money you've already paid for insurance and linens? I do see your point about the place no longer being "yours". I would remove anything i really valued before renting out a place, but then it wouldn't feel the same.
Thanks Daphne! He is very insightful. I do feel I've got a great deal here!
Hi Miss M!
Rental income is his baby and he's not going through with it.
We are going to keep the linens as they will work for the cottage as well. They were 50% off so we may never have to buy linens again!
The ski condo insurance upgrade costs the same whether we rent or not. The cottage insurance upgrade is still in the works. It will make a savings of $100 a year if we do not rent out.
I think it would have made all the difference if I knew when purchasing that renting was going to be part of it. Because that was not the case, making the transition hasn't been the easiest.
Thanks for your comment!Valentines Bento Bear

Coca cola never ceases to amaze. Never.
Coke’s all about sharing and happiness in the act of it. But why sell only one Coke when you can sell two? Leo Burnett in Colombia devised a method to get freshmen at colleges to become friends — and sell twice the amount of soda — with “Friendly Twist,” a bottle with a new type of cap that can only be opened with another bottle of Coke.
The insight here is that all of us feel isolated at the first day of college – no friends and no conversations.Coca cola tried to break the ice amongst the freshmen lot by creating this unique bottle. And of course, it doesn’t hurt that the call to action was a dual sell as well.
A great idea based on a great insight. That’s how each and every one of Coke’s campaign go viral. Kudos Leo Burnett!Visitors Are Always Welcome

NEW YORK (CBSMiami) – While more traditional styles of women’s underwear dominate the market, a number of independent brands are catering to a much larger market.
At the New York headquarters of Lively, the unmentionables on display aren’t necessarily meant to be kept under wraps.
“These styles look like you could wear them outside, not just under your clothes,” said Karina Mitchell.
“And they’ve certainly been styled that way,” Alexandra Alquiza responded.
Underwear is big business, and Victoria’s Secret has helped shape the industry.
According to IBIS World, in 2016, L-Brands, the parent company of Victoria’s Secret, known for its enticing looks, accounted for 83 percent of the U.S. retail lingerie market.
But Lively’s director of marketing, Alexandra Alquiza, says a growing number of women want something different.
“Ultimate comfort coupled with high style… really tapping into a new definition of sexy,” she said. “The sexy that resonates with women today is around being active and outgoing and confident.”
Athleticwear has taken off and is now finding its way into intimate apparel.
More businesses are creating a diverse range of undergarments that include larger sizes, increased comfort and styles that can blur the lines..
People who stopped by the label’s New York photo shoot seemed interested.
“I really like the more flexible casual look,” one person said.
Another person added, “As long as it’s comfortable and gives you support, that’s all that matters to me.”Cherry Trial

0679 MYANMAR (Kachin State) - Kachin girls on the bank of Mali River
The Kachin people (also known as Jingpho people) inhabit the Kachin Hills in northern Myanmar's Kachin State and neighbouring areas of China and India. They are actually an ethnic affinity of several tribal groups, known for their fierce independence, disciplined fighting skills, complex clan inter-relations, craftsmanship, herbal healing and jungle survival skills. In recent decades, their animist beliefs have been largely supplanted by their accelerated embrace of Christianity.
The Kachin ancestors migrated towards the south from the Tibetan plateau, and during the British colonial period, some tribes were integrated into the state, while others operated with a large autonomy. During WWII they provided assistance to British, Chinese and American units, but following the Burma’s independence they fought both for and against the government during most of the ethnic conflicts which have torn the country. In 1961 was formed the Kachin Independence Organisation (KIO) with its military wing, the Kachin Independent Army (KIA). In 1994 the KIO chose to enter into a ceasefire with the regime, but that delivered neither security nor prosperity to the Kachin, so in 2011 fighting has resumed.
Regarding the clothes, they differs slightly from place to place, but most commons is Bhamaw attire, worn by the people living on the eastern bank of the Mali River, which formes, after the meeting with N'Mai River, Ayeyarwady River. Women’s attire consists of multi-coloured woolen headdress and a black velvet jacket, decorated with three tiers of small button shaped silver coins and jingles go around the neck, at the front and go down along the front button line the waist besides the back to go with a woolen sarong embroidered. Similarly decorated pair of leggings completes the attire. Since the sarong is not stitched, a belt of red cloth measuring about 1,5m above waist fastens the sarong in place, together with a black loose cane ring belt. Silver dominates also the women's jewelry, even though Kachin state is known as the land of jades and gold.
About the stamp
The stamp was issued on April 10, 2013, to commemorate 65 Years of diplomatic relations between Myanmar and Russia.

Say what you will about the Star Wars prequels, but the second trilogy undeniably had its moments. Sure, sometimes you had to listen to monologues about sand to get to the good parts, but once you did the pay offs were well worth it. Undeniably, the scene in which we see Anakin Skywalker fully transformed into Darth Vader is certainly one of those epic moments, and now Lego has done us the great service of making a buildable set out of it.
I’m sure that everyone reading this is aware of what scene I am talking about, but to refresh your memory, let’s revisit this blast from the past as we review the Lego Darth Vader Transformation Kit.
The Lego Darth Vader Transformation Set
Shortly after his fateful duel with Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker awakes in a dimly lit room, propped up on a stainless steel table, surrounded by medical droids. His last encounter with his former master has cost him his arms, his legs, and as he is about to find out, his wife. Slowly, he takes in his surroundings, unaware that this room is the site of his final departure from all things that were Anakin Skywalker. To the side of the table lurks his new master, the evil Emperor Palpatine watching the transformation of his cyborg apprentice unfold.
Lego brings this scene to life with incredible detail in this new 282 piece set; Lego character collectors will love the three, unique mini-figures that are included. This set gives you the opportunity to add wounded Anakin, Darth Vader, and Emperor Palpatine to your collection. The Vader figure even comes with a removable helmet beneath which you will find the burnt, agonized face of his former self, Anakin Skywalker.
My favorite aspect of this set is how intricately it allows you to reenact the fateful scene that it depicts. Once built, a table that rotates with the turn of a knob will allow you to switch from wounded Anakin to Darth Vader, in his suit. At this point, you have nearly finished helping the burgeoning Sith make his transformation, but the process is not quite complete. Attach the helmet with the aid of an applicator crane, then push the nob on the front of the set inward to watch the table rise into a vertical position.
The manipulation of another lever will send one of the medical droids flying, mimicking the rage that Vader displays in the film when he learns of his wife’s death.
Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine are two of the greatest villains in all of fiction, and to get the chance to take part in one of their most pivotal scenes together is too good of an opportunity to pass up. I won’t pretend that I don’t love all things Star Wars, and most things Lego, but nevertheless, I can acknowledge that not all products are equal. This interactive new set is incredibly detailed, and I am very confident that it will make for a tremendous addition to any Star Wars or Lego fan’s collection.
Certainly, it will look great on your shelf, but only if you can stop playing with it long enough to put it there.Do we sign an unfit Traore?
That’s right it could be another Welly. Apparently the permit was agreed but his fitness levels are shite because he hasn’t played since last October!
We signed Welly and he spent the whole of the 6 months getting fit with the U21’s, cost us a small fortune but thats nothing compared to how much the Traore deal will cost, especially if he doesn’t play a game for us!
We need players that can hit the ground running, we need goals and lots of them! I would say get Lambert add to that Carroll, Vaz Te and Carlton we should be good to go (famous last words)
Advertisements
Yes! If he gets the game time he will be great but we all know big Sam as you mentioned Welly is just one of a whole list of players Sam got that weren’t fit and that was his reason for not playing them. Of course! Sams great mind working……
Well he hasn’t signed yet so maybe the penny has dropped..
Personally if he isn’t fit.. He isn’t worth it..
That’s money we could spend on a player with a lower wage and the same capability…
The guy isn’t even proven in the premier league…
Why not sign Kenwyne jones?
We have missed out on shane long and jelavic…
What about someone who we know can score in the prem.. To be honest Fulham did the right thing in recruiting Darren bent… Yet he hasn’t hit form because he hasn’t had the service.. With our midfield, the lad would get the service..
We need a proven scorer.. To save us from relegation… It’s fucking simple!!
Berbatov?
Kenwyne Jones wouldn’t actually be a bad signing. He’s a proven scorer and a bit if an ‘Allardyce’ player. Rumour has it he’s on his way to Everton though. Personally I think we should go with a proven Premiership player. Demba was unproven and unfit when we signed him. He scored a few goals, but not enough to keep us up.
No not KJ please no!
Traore’s goals scored in Russian league aint that great all tap ins plus the height no headed goals on you tube of him wouldn’t it be great to go back in time & have Cottee & Macca up front again there take the piss out of defences oh wishful thinking. back in the real world still want Allarshit out of our club
Gary Lineker was like that though…
Proof yet again that Allardyce hasn’t a fucking clue.. Needs to go asap before he wastes more cash… More crooked than Harry something just doesn’t add up? Must be on the take for signing the biggest load of shite I’ve ever seen the whole squad is pony!!
Even spent 15million on an injured Carroll.
Is this not a waste of the clubs limited funds? We’re not in a position (financially and league) to take a gamble on on an unfit and unproven striker, yes he’s scored goals in Russia but in that case he may have well have just scored loads of goals in Scotland. Go all out for Lambert or dare i say Berbatov (although wages will scupper that) i believe there may be time still to try Guidetti.
Guidetti to Stoke has been confirmed
Shit!
There are options imo.
Why is every single transfer window the same at our club….Oh lets go for this really good foreign player, worth a fortune, we can get him on the cheap….Oh, hold on he needs a work permit. In the meanwhile all the half decent options are gone…. never mind, on the last day of the window, there’s always this cheap Brazilian. Lies, Lies, and more Lies, from our scummy owners.
Yeah it’s looking like another fuck up in the transfer window..
Yakubu is on his way…. Be afraid. As posted earlier, cheap option.
Oh Jesus him again!?
YAKUBU!!!! thats gotta be a wind up FFS!!!

I weighed myself on Friday and I know I shouldn't do that, but I had to. The scale was taunting me! I am now 5 pounds lighter! Go me!
Look at what a little effort produces....all I did was watch my caloric intake AND skip the pop. Or should I say Soda (that's what they call it down here in GA).
I wore my jeans that were tight and the "muffin top" wasn't as big as it used to be over the Christmas break. Gotta love those "Non-Scale" victories because they are better than the actual number on the scale.
Now, I just have to get through this flu and back to normal. I have too much to do!

With the extreme consequences you may face in case you are not properly represented, it could be safe to say the consultation session is of critical importance. Some probably won't think a consultation is important after they are hiring a high profile attorney to represent them. They could simply uncover who is the most well-known and established attorney from our area and hire the attorney based on reputation. This could prove disastrous since it prescribes to a typical myth. Which is there is a thought a seen lawyer will automatically give you the outcome you want. Can you preordain an assured acquittal in the criminal case for those who have a extremely high-profile and highly expensive attorney representing you. The answer is, of course, no. There can be no guarantees possible regarding the end result from a court proceeding criminal or civil. However, in case you really have the best representation your case, you'll be within a greater position than a person that lacks effective representation.
Also, it is worth mentioning that the costliest legal representation might not automatically equate with all the best representation. You do not desire to hire a lawyer based solely on how the lawyer looks in some recoverable format or what their reputation suggests. You simply must consider the steps to rent an incredibly qualified and effective attorney that will properly represent you. Therefore it may need to create a consultation with the attorney so that you can determine if you are right for one another. Seriously, both you and your dui attorney must gel together otherwise things might not bode well in terms of of precisely how your case proceeds. In the criminal case, a disappointing judgment can be disastrous and also have life changing consequences. Again for this reason it is so important to put together a preliminary consultation session where you'll be able to debate the particulars of your case. This begins motion your skill to achieve the correct representation since you can weigh how you feel on regardless of whether you're utilizing the right attorney.
During this initial consultation, you have to be completely honest together with the attorney. Holding back any information could prove highly counterproductive as misleading an attorney will undermine his/her capacity to fully handle your case properly. What will be the advantage of that. Not merely would there be no profit the problems which may originate from withholding information from your attorney could be legion. Be forthcoming together with your attorney. Any deviation from this suggestion couldn't survive to help you in any way. You must also answer the attorney's question completely and distinctly. This will likely aid in the attorney's capability to make effective determinations concerning how to proceed forward as well as what best option. How important may be the initial consultation having a criminal defense attorney. Thinking about the extreme consequences you could possibly face if you are improperly represented, it would be reliable advice the consultation session is of critical importance.

Goonersden brings you news from top football news sites from the likes of ESPN, SkySport, Daily Mail, Daily Star and Metro… We also Analyse football, player, transfer and predict Arsenal starting line-up.
Manchester City are lining up a £35m bid for Arsenal forward Alexis Sanchez, according to the Daily Mail.
The Chile international looks set to join City on a free transfer this summer, when his contract with the Gunners expires.
But the Premier League leaders are now ready to splash the cash this month in response to their injury problem and amid interest in Sanchez from French giants Paris Saint-Germain.
City have lost Brazilian striker Gabriel Jesus for around two months with a knee ligament injury. That leaves Sergio Aguero as Pep Guardiola’s only out-and-out striker as City compete on four fronts.
PSG’s interest is another concern. With Sanchez now into the final six months of his Arsenal contract, he can already sign a pre-contract agreement with the big-spending Ligue 1 leaders.
City are set to respond with a bid worth more than half the £60m they agreed with Arsenal last summer. That deal fell through when the Gunners failed to land Monaco’s Thomas Lemar as a replacement.The 76ers ($77 million) and Nuggets ($75.7 million) access the 28th- and 30th-ranked payrolls in the NBA Live Mobile Coins league.

Tabby’s Star Dimming Likely Caused by Dust
The mystery surrounding the periodic dimming of Tabby’s Star -- KIC 8462852 – may have been solved at last. Located 1,300 light years away from Earth, Tabby’s Star has fascinated the scientific community with its unexplained, unpredictable dimming, sometimes by as much as 20%. Theories have included speculation that the dimming was caused by an alien megastructure or Dyson sphere. The SETI Institute has observed Tabby’s Star with its Allen Telescope Array, but found no evidence of extraterrestrial intelligence.
New observations reported in a paper in the Astrophysical Journal show that the dimming was more likely caused by ordinary dust. Observations will continue when the star can be seen again in February or March.
People may continue to believe that Tabby’s Star’s behavior is caused by aliens because, as Seth Shostak, Senior Astronomer at the SETI Institute noted, “Aliens are the duct tape of science.”

What a wonderful letter. Ha, Skyping was very fun, and very short. I liked it a lot, but I won’t lie this last week I was stuck thinking about home a bit more. But I shook myself out of it, and I decided it probably is a good idea that we don’t Skype or call every week... because it’s THAT nice! I agree though this last time really was a blessing, talk with grandparents, see and talk with you all, and most of all see my new nephew, WOW! Perfect timing buddy.
Wow, I also got a little emotional reading about the priesthood blessings the bishopric gave you guys. As a missionary we are promised that our families will be greatly blessed with spiritual blessings while we are not there. I fully believe that this experience honestly was one of those manifestations. I am really grateful for our inspired church leadership and priesthood that God uses to express His love to His saints. This only can be done in His true church as well.
Awesome. Well I guess I should probably fill you guys in on my last little week. Well, big news. We got the news on HOW the Mission will be split, and we will know WHO will be split next week with transfers. Sounds like Juazeiro will be a part of a whole different mission, "Natal". Ha, so there is a 1% chance that I will go to another big city of Brazil. But we’ll see. The conference was very good and I loved to hear the President and his Wife really express their love for us. I also was able to talk and converse with just about all my good friends from the mission.
For the work, we baptized a man named Cristovam. He is a 60-year-old man. He was an alcoholic a month ago, but the moment our Ward Mission Leader told him about the church, he stopped. He is a very humble big ol’ Eyore (from Pooh Bear) type guy. It was very heart warming to see him draw very close to his Heavenly Father. Like what Elder McLaws said after he interviewed him, you can FEEL that the Atonement is really working in his life.
Love you all, BYE

Types of Internet site Hosting Available in Lombard IL
There are various sorts of shared organizing bundles appropriate for different web pages in regards to the system resources or the common organizing platform they need. To select one of the most appropriate common hosting solution for your web site, you have to review what server-side software program it needs, how many everyday check outs you expect at the beginning and also over time, along with any other special needs that could need to be covered.
One of the most appropriate option for tiny sized online websites with a number of hundred or a number of thousand viewers is a shared holding account. With this kind of web room hosting, each consumer pays only for their account, which lowers the total price per user significantly. There are various hosting accounts differing from one hosting vendor to one more, equipping different allocations of web server storage area as well as regular monthly bandwidth, different email quotas and so forth. The advantage is that you can acquire an account that will certainly provide the requirements your website in fact needs. You will certainly not need to pay lots of cash for a bundle you will certainly not make use of, or wind up with a small sized plan that could not organize the site. We, at I Like Myhost- Hosting, provide a great selection of common holding accounts proper for individual or small company sites that even include pre-installed script-powered systems like Joomla, Mambo, Drupal or WordPress – making things simpler. If you commence with a less effective plan as well as you require more capabilities, moving to a premium account takes just a click.
A disadvantage of the common webhosting setting is that the web servers have some software program applications installed on them and also you could not activate added software. Provided websites, mostly internet store fronts, demand applications to be triggered on the hosting web server for them to run, and with a common webhosting account, you can mount just software that does not demand complete web server origin accessibility. Online Web servers and Dedicated Servers
For internet portals that request total root-level gain access to, or if your site has several thousands or even numerous everyday audiences, what you require is a digital personal web servers or a dedicated server. A personal virtual web server is a software program emulation of a committed service and it executes in specifically the same way.
Online Personal Internet Servers
Like the common internet hosting strategies, the online private servers and also the dedicated web server plans include diverse performances depending on just what the organizing company offers. A virtual web server internet hosting bundle contains guaranteed server storage space, arbitrary access memory and main processing system use quotas that could sometimes be enhanced for short durations of time gave that there are extra sources on the physical web server. With a specialized internet holding web server, the only restriction is the equipment it is making use of, as well as it can be revved up by transforming or including parts.
Devoted Servers
Still, given hosting firms supply taken care of dedicated web server hosting services where they carry out hosting web server administration tasks on behalf of the customer. This could be a part of package or an added alternative.
Before Getting to a Choice in Lombard
Deciding on the leading hosting plan is vital as it can affect the proper performance of an online portal. Before choosing a strategy, contrast the advantages and disadvantages, check completely all the requirements for the web website to operate appropriately, especially if it is script-driven.SUPERVALU and Instacart expand delivery partnership
US retailer SUPERVALU and on-demand grocery delivery service Instacart are expanding their relationship through a new multi-year contract.
SUPERVALU and Instacart first started working together to offer same-day grocery delivery in September 2015.
In a statement issued yesterday (11 December), Instacart said that, under the new contract, “SUPERVALU recently launched refreshed e-commerce sites Powered by Instacart for four of its retail banners across the nation: Cub, Farm Fresh Food and Pharmacy, Shop ‘n Save, and Shoppers Food and Pharmacy.”
In addition to the same-day deliveries, Instacart will also work with SUPERVALU on a click and collect service.
According to Instacart: .”So one of my treat meals is the Indian food at Whole Foods. Last time I was there, I grabbed a drink to enhance my treat meal and it happened to be a Pineapple, Coconut, Nutmeg soda. I also happen to love all three of those flavors. The drink was fabulous tasting. Later I started thinking that those flavors would make a great smoothie. I've been trying to find ways to make my smoothies a full meal instead of a few hundred calories that leave me famished. I work out in the mornings and I am just starved all day (which is why I eat six meals). So, I added oats, a serving of protein powder and a banana and a half to give it all some substance. And it worked. I was full for about three hours, which for me is awesome. You could use this recipe for a meal or consider it two servings and save the rest for later. A trick I learned from Rachel Ray (I've spent many a Sunday morning watching Rachel Ray shows with my grandmother), is to use whole nutmeg and grate it yourself. You can not believe the difference. I would highly recommend it. And of course, Rachel Ray used her nutmeg every time she cooked greens (which is also very good)! I hope you like the smoothie! My summers are just not complete without a smoothie on the menu.

Moreover, everyone has a story to tell, and expertise and experiences to share. This is something valuable that can potentially benefit a lot of people”
The people who are being asked the questions can set a price to answer a question using “diamonds”. These are later converted to Indonesian Rupiahs. Users whose paid questions have been answered by the source can also invite as many people as possible to “eavesdrop” and take a look at the questions and answers for the price of one diamond or IDR 1,000 ($0.10).
Infonesia claims to have over 30 sources on its platform. All of them are from the showbiz and entertainment sector. The startup is looking forward to expanding to other sectors.
According to a press statement, the startup’s valued asset is the primary sources, which provide information or news that has not been taken from gossip portals or internet forums.
Rahman said, “For supply side, we have an exclusive deal that we’ve prepared for leading Indonesian influencers (celebs, public figure, experts).
He further added, “Demand side is highly influenced by hot shot respondents too so we’re still focusing on creating a stable product and new features based on early customers feedbacks.”
Other startups in this domain apart from Infonesia include global platforms such as Quora, Reddit, and Yahoo! Answers, among others.

Description
A presentation of the Australian Centre for Architectural History, Urban and Cultural Heritage (ACAHUCH) as part of its annual symposium 'Haunting, Memory and Place'
Twenty years of thinking about traumascapes
In this keynote I’ll look back at what interested me about physical sites of trauma when I first started noticing powerlines running between trauma and lived experience of places. I will speak about moments of clarity, about dead-end strips in my early research – about where they led me.
And then the last ten years – my ideas about the role traumascapes play in mourning, remembering and making meaning have been both shaken and extended. I’ll discuss how, to what effect. Some shifts I’ve been thinking about are the mainstreaming of grief’s public life (once wild and uncontained spontaneous memorials, for e.g., are now culturally expected, almost mandated, in the West), the resolute everywhereness of traumascapes, the gradual depathologisation of trauma in public conversations and cultural imaginings, as well a quiet revolution in the way we do memorialisation.
I will propose the next stage in imagining the future of sites inscribed with violence and loss. Which is to say I will argue for the necessity of superseding the idea of traumascapes in human engagement with such places. Superseding it with what? Possibly with the idea of a site of conscience (let’s talk!). The essential work of sites of conscience is to publically confront past violations of rights and personhoods, to lay bare the immense legacy of such violations while at the same time making us see how these violations persist in the present, often in plain view, only under a different name or in the name of some other or other-seeming ideology.

AustraliaBrand,.
The books say that branding as a mass market strategy emerged during the mid 1800’s with the industrial revolution, but Branding is not a new age concept. Branding has been in existence before human beings came into existence, the unique stripes on Zebras or Tigers, or the spots on cheetahs or the rings in a tree trunk, are all identities or brands. Brand is a vast concept, broader than what it is being defined as.
The biggest question for us at P(x) is “What is the best way to brand a product?” We try to answer this question with a unique thinking process. We believe that we can create everlasting brands if we don’t limit our imagination to the existing trend in the industry. We believe we can make even the most common product stand above its competitors if we give the right marketing. For us, Brand is life and we dare to think beyond the boundaries. We believe Brands are more than products or services.
We Believe in Brands.Total Real Estate Solutions Moving, Lending, Escrow Real Estate, Lending, Escrow Welcome to your NORTH SAN DIEGO real estate resource.

The lighter pink cardstock is Pink Passion stamped with the BOHO BLOSSOMS background stamp. I used a chipboard flower inked all over with the Pink Passion craft ink and then went around the outside edges with my finger using the Rich Razzleberry classic pad. The clear button is backed with a Crushed Curry circle and threaded with a skinny lemon yellow ribbon.
I should use chipboard more often, I really liked the end result of this card! Let me know what you think!

A letter relating to ending the current session received from the Office of the President was presented by Speaker Onsari Gharti at today’s meeting — thereby proroguing the house. Earlier today, a decision to this end was reached at the meeting of the Council of Ministers.
On the occasion, the Speaker also presented the details of the activities carried out during the session. Accordingly, the parliament met for 135 times in 114 days since the session began on May 3, 2016. A total of 17 bills were endorsed during the period.
The period also saw the tabling of the second constitution amendment bill. Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal was also elected during this period.
Likewise, an impeachment motion was registered against Chief Commissioner of the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) Lokman Singh Karki.
In her remarks, the Speaker said that this session proved important in terms of implementing the new constitution and thanked the government and people for the successful holding of the first phase of local-level elections.
Similarly, we need to hold the provincial as well as general elections within the period set by the Constitution. RSSMaj Gen (Ret) Edward L. Bolton, Jr.

The 1989 tour took Taylor all over the world and was clearly one of the most memorable experiences of her life. “I don’t want to forget anything that happened on this tour,” she adds in the video. “It’s one of those remarkable moments in time when everything felt exciting. Looking out into an endless ocean of crowd, that was everything. we’re all really sad that it’s ending but we’re really happy because of what it was.” Stream Taylor’s music completely unlimited and ad-free HERE.

After winning big at the iHeartRadio Awards April 3 — including an honor for Best Tour — the 26-year-old admitted that the 1989 era of her life had come to an end, so this video is the perfect way to cap off the last year and a half. Now, we only have to hope that she’s in the studio working hard on some new jams for a 2016 record…

New Zealand has been discussed, the first time anyway, and I’ve made mention of my final days, but there is still so much happening and to come in the next few weeks. I know I sound like a broken record, but it truly is amazing how much can happen in a few months. I look at how I felt, the place I was in at the beginning of term, and already I’ve filled a whole new chapter in my Australian story. Hindsight is 20/20, and though it hasn’t always been easy, I owe it to the memory and experience to recall each moment for what it was.
Those close to me will have known that I met someone when I was travelling six months ago. Six months ago! Even writing it makes the memory seem so distant. At the time, it was nothing. When I travel, I feel like a chameleon. I do like to complain about trivial things, but I like to believe I maintain a fairly happy disposition. I’ve always found travel brings out the best in me, or anyone really- like a Kristy 2.0. Happier, more open, braver, more adventurous. I often do things when I travel that I never would at home, and this is something I strive to work on. Meeting people through couch surfing, facebook and other social apps is no problem for me. That is what happened with H.
I was excited to take a tour in new Zealand, but what has always given me the biggest thrill is spending time with locals. They know places the best, have secret spots, great stories, and give you a true impression of their home. H and I met and decided that we might like to see each other again. I had no plans on going back, so he came and visited me for a week to do the Great Ocean Road. I firmly believe you don’t know if you’ll get along with someone until you travel with them. I was extremely nervous at the prospect of someone coming to visit me, but it worked out well. We ended up saving a koala on the side of the road, having parrots land on our heads, ticking all the views along the coast off, and I even conquered my fear of heights to get some epic shots in the Grampians (sorry mom!) The visit timed well with moving into a new house in Melbourne. Before we knew it, the week was over and there we were, apart again.
I believe over a month went by before we agreed I’d come back to New Zealand to see his corner of the island. We had no way of knowing there would be two cyclones passing through, covering most of my visit in rain and days when he had to work. I did enjoy a lovely winery day in Hawkes Bay and I got to revisit Waiheke Island.
The thing is, you have no way of predicting the future. You take a chance and roll with it. How surprised was I to come back to Melbourne to start a short teaching contract and find out that it was not, in fact, to be. I threw myself into keeping busy with friends and wondered how this dream of a cross country relationship would no longer be mine. I read an article lately about not taking being emotional as an insult. Feeling deeply can make things harder on a person, but it also means that when you give, you give all to a person, idea, or thing. My heart was open, I tried, and I think it stands for something. Months later, we’ve talked a bit, I am over the situation, and see it as just another part of the big adventure that was this year.
After that event, the next two months were filled with lovely days. I’ve been keeping fairly busy since April and loving it. I went to Mount Macedon with Rimma one weekend. An hour north of Melbourne, she was so kind to get me out of the city for a girls weekend. We didn’t realize there were a few wineries in the region and made an afternoon of it, surrounded by the resplendent fall colours. Our airbnb was a room in a cozy farmhouse near Hanging Rock, complete with a free big breakfast! We hiked Hanging Rock the next morning then went off in search of mushrooms. Yes, just like my father does, Rimmas family has been foraging for mushrooms on a pine plantation near the Macedon area. It felt like a treasure hunt, all dark pine needles on the ground and then bam, you find one! I got way too excited and Rimma said I was quite good at it. We ended our second day by exploring an open Park that owners allow viewing on weekends and followed that with a classy picnic- cheese, kielbasa, hummus and wine straight from the bottle. It was a wonderful weekend.
I also went to the Great Ocean road again twice with Sam. Once was my first surfing lesson (I’m horrible) and the next was touring with her and her friend Veronica. I truly believe there are few things more enjoyable in this life than road trips with good people.
By about mid May, my contract at Camberwell was soon ending. I ended up meeting a local named Nick for brunch and we got along swimmingly. He took me to Holey Moley which is probably the coolest mini put location ever, and we ended our night with food on Hardware Lane and pretending we could salsa in a dark bar full of strangers. The following weekend we went out to Cathedral Ranges for a hike but as we climbed up it’s steep outcrops it began to rain and hail. Yup, the hail was when we called it quits. Still, he suggested we go to Bright for the long weekend which really excited me. I’d been wanting to go for a few months and didn’t think I’d have the chance before going home.
I am not exaggerating in saying that weekend was incredible from the moment we left Melbourne. He didn’t mind as I became DJ for the weekend and we raced past sleepy towns hiding among the Victorian hills. We stopped in Glenrowan where Ned Kelly had his final showdown, got some cheesy tourist photos, then popped into Gapsted wines where Nick waited patiently as I sampled their never ending list of libations.
By the time we got to Bright, the sun was setting, but we found our way up to the top of an old service road for our first summit views of the area. Bright is supposedly even more beautiful in autumn when all the colours are at their most vibrant, but it still reminded us of a cute New England style town. We grabbed some tapas style snacks at the local grocery then checked into our airbnb. We knew there was another couple staying, but it didn’t bother us in the least. Our host Robyn had a gorgeous home overlooking the mountains, two cute dogs, and the piece de resistance, a wood stove in the living room. After everyone went to bed it became all ours, perfect for unwinding on a winter night. There was a local restaurant that looks Moulin Rouge meets a 1930s living room parlour where we ate that first night. Absolutely delicious and right down the street.
On the Saturday, we grabbed a late brunch then rented bikes for some cycling. The area had turned an old rail trail into a cycling one so you can connect to the many tiny towns in the area. I had a bike with the hardest damn seat imaginable, so I wasn’t motivated to go too far… but we made it to Ringer Reef winery where we shared a cheese plate and Feather top winery where we grabbed a picnic blanket and sat on the lawn to enjoy a glass of red. It must have been the perfect lighting because a stranger came up to us and asked to take a photo. I would go back in an instant.
Since then, I’ve been enjoying my final days in the company of Nick and those friends who are are still leaving here. I’ve been to mulled wine fests, the Melbourne night markets, movie nights, secret bars, the botanical gardens, eating up all the brunches I can, and falling in love with Melbourne for one last time. I am thankful to have people back home who love me, but I find it harder say goodbye this time. I celebrated my 28th Birthday with a few good friends at dinner and tagged along for Nick’s roommates epic 30th the day before. It was a good last weekend in the city.
It’s a weird sensation when you’re aware of your last days in a place. You savour every cold morning, every hot coffee, every amble through the neighbourhoods of familiarity. You know the world is telling you to move on with dignity, but you still find a struggle in letting go. I leave for Western Australia Friday and that is one shining beacon amongst the other realities settling in. I spend the weekend in Perth where Rimma will join me for Canada Day! I have a day booked on Rottnest Island to see the quokkas and will get to Margaret River before my two week tour begins. I’ll save the details for my last post in the Australian adventure come end of July. Stay tuned folks.
I feel like this year has helped deepen my resolve and my outlook on life. Coming back overseas didn’t make a lot of sense to some people close to me, but I chose to go with my own intuition. This year has probably been the best of my life. Even when I was living the daily work grind, my happiness was on an endless streak. I finally jumped the gun and got my first tattoo last week. Nick came for moral support. A week later I am still jubilant about it. For me it signifies the responsibilities and expectations society has for us- work, buy the house, have the kids, settle in for the rest of your days. But you always have a choice, whether it’s going back to school, getting out of a bad relationship, or doing like me and going to explore the world for a bit. This little bird on my shoulder will always remind me to do what makes me happy. In this life, none of us get out alive anyway, so you might as well try to make your own slice of paradise for the shirt time you are here.
I continue to learn about the power of being open as well. I’ve been willing to go on dates because you never know who you might meet. I feel things pretty deeply, and saying goodbye to Melbourne this time around will be much harder, as I have good things in life I don’t want to let go. At this point Melbourne feels like more of a second home then anything. I made some permanent friends here who have given me many happy days. Then I had the pleasure of meeting Nick by chance, and that’s probably the hardest one to swallow right now. But you know what? If I hadn’t been open, I may not have come back here. Would not have the memories I have. Would not have spent my last days in Melbourne living and laughing in loving instead of listlessly counting the days until my flight home departs. So I’ll take it. The tears, the heavy heart, the rough days when reality settles in. Because it was worth it. Melbourne was worth it. They were worth it. He was worth it.
And, it’s always like Winnie the Pooh said, isn’t it?
So I’m spending my last days , turning the pages and writing the final chapter, but who knows what comes next…

Discipline is the process of sticking to your strategy without wavering. Discipline is holding your emotions in check. When it comes to bitcoin, it’s hard not to be caught up in the hype and noise, whether it’s justified or not.
There are a lot of buzzwords used in tandem with bitcoin, one of which is blockchain. To be fair, blockchain is more than a buzzword as it’s a technology that appears here to stay (but there is still an element of uncertainty to it). Blockchain is a technology that, among other things, allows for faster and cheaper exchange of assets, whereas bitcoin is the traded asset class (a digital currency). Bitcoin is an asset class in potentially uncharted territory, and the uncharted territory looks set to only continue now that shorting has begun.
As of the beginning of this week, people can now invest or punt on the future value of bitcoin. You can go long (“bullish” that it will continue to go up) or short (“bearish” that the price will go down). As I mentioned earlier this brings further unknowns to an already unknown asset class, as previously you could only buy it to go “long”. If the bulls are right, it will become a legitimate asset class of the future, potentially rivalling gold as an asset class. However, if the bears are correct, it’s possible that bitcoin will go the way of the tulips – in 1636 a single tulip bulb cost 10 times the annual wage in the Netherlands; in 1637 the tulip bubble burst and “investors” lost a fortune.
Following on from the example of The Netherlands in the 1630s, in more recent times we’ve seen a bubble burst on the back of shorting. In The Big Short, before the US housing market bubble burst, the bears (or the people wanting to short the market) needed an instrument to allow them to take the other side of the market. The resulting instrument – known as collaterised debt obligations or CDOs – allowed the bears to finally have their claws and short the market. It still took a while for the bubble to burst despite the creation of CDOs, so we still don’t know what the short term of bitcoin looks like even if this theory proves to be correct. There are no guarantees that’s what we’re seeing now with bitcoin but, as Mark Twain once said, “History doesn't repeat itself but it often rhymes”.
When it comes to investing, the important thing isn’t always how big your circle of competence is, but having the discipline to know what is in that circle and what is not. At Six Park, we’re happy to sit on the sidelines with bitcoin. We know for sure that bitcoin has made many people rich but, more importantly, we know that it has the capacity to create catastrophic damage to investors’ portfolios that could take decades to recover, if they recover at all. This is a risk that we don’t think investors should take. At Six Park our investment philosophy is to stick to a proven approach of prudent asset allocation, risk management and keeping costs low to provide returns for our customers.
At a time when volatility is exceptionally low around the world in most asset classes, bitcoin is bucking that trend with jaw-dropping volatility. Volatility should never be ignored as it’s inextricably related to risk. On this note I’d like to finish with this joke that I saw about bitcoin highlighting its volatility. Who knows what one bitcoin will be worth tomorrow? We prefer to stay disciplined and stick to what we know best.
A boy asked his bitcoin-investing dad for one bitcoin for his birthday.

The article references Animal Aid’s excellent campaign which is cataloguing death and injuries to race horses.
Over the past three years Animal Aid has recorded more than 500 fatalities on British racecourses. The roll call is relentlessly miserable: broke leg; broke leg; broke leg; broke neck; severed tendon; heart attack; collapsed and died.He was born during the Dust Bowl years and he dreamed of being a farmer. But back then, as now, farmers usually are farmers because they are born into farm families. Dad was born into a family that milked a few cows but didn't have enough land to support more than one son, and he was not that son.
So Dad became a schoolteacher, and because he had been shaped by genetics and circumstances to aim high and work hard, he became a topnotch schoolteacher.
He became such a good teacher (winning national awards) that he was recruited to the faculty of a newly-formed vocational-technical school, and within a couple of years he had been selected to be the school's director. It wasn't necessarily a great promotion; at that point the vo-tech had classes meeting in half a dozen classrooms across the tiny town where it was located and the final motion at every board meeting was that the business officer pay the bills "as far as the money goes." Honestly, no one would have been too surprised if the doors had quietly closed.
But my dad, who had dreamed of being a farmer, turned out to be spectacularly suited for his new job as the director of this school. He was organized and persistent, and he passionately believed in his institution's ability to prepare young people for the workplace, if they also were willing to aim high and work hard.
For 28 years he shaped the school, pushing it toward excellence with hard work and sometimes pulling it along with nothing more than his stubborn belief that the school needed to be better. Then, as he watched the campus take shape and students win national skills competitions and graduates make good lives with their new skills, Dad didn't let up. He kept pushing for better programs and better facilities, and for accreditation that emphasized quality. He still dreamed of farming, so in the early mornings and late nights he worked the land he and my mother had bought and where they were raising five children.
Last Friday, the day before Dad's 85th birthday, the vo-tech school (now a technical college) named its student union after Dad and Mom. The dedicatory plaque talks about Dad's "vision, commitment, and leadership," and about Mom's support of his vision. It doesn't list all the people whose lives were changed for the better because my father believed so strongly in vocational education; that list could have covered most of the walls of the building.
He might have been a fine farmer but that dream took a back seat to his vision, and thousands of graduates saw their dreams come true because his did not.Exposures series

Texte intégral
1Reaktion Books’ Exposures series, edited by Peter Hamilton and Mark Haworth-Booth, is comprised of 13 volumes and counting, each less than 200 pages with 80 high-quality illustrations in color and black and white. Currently available titles include Photography and Australia, Photography and Spirit, Photography and Cinema, Photography and Literature, Photography and Flight, Photography and Egypt, Photography and Science, Photography and Africa, Photography and Italy, Photography and the USA, Photography and Japan, Photography and Death, and Photography and Anthropology. Each volume is of interest on its own for the particular thematic intersection it explores and for its survey of pertinent examples and approaches to its theme, but, taken as a whole, the interest of this series resides less in photography itself as a historical issue, or in its various and sundry applications or “exposures,” and more so instead in the conjunction that joins the two categories together.
2The titular “and,” in other words, is given to us by the series as something like photography’s verb, its distinctive activity or operation, and as such, the range of potential photographic subjects is, by definition, limitless. This speaks volumes about photography as a distinctive form of relating to the world. It would be hard to imagine a parallel series devoted to writing, say, or art, or belief, or desire, or thought because each of these categories assume a subjective directedness and consistency that photography at once aims for and belies. Photography, we are to understand from the rhetorical construction of the series and its formulaic titles, passively registers knowledge or impression or exposure or fleeting interest, rather than being an active expression of faith or beauty or truth or conviction. Photography and this, photography and that, “photography and” ad infinitum—this format figures the technological, sensual, and epistemological condition of the artistic subject becoming the photographic subject, the modern subject becoming postmodern, the human becoming machine, the enlightenment subject becoming the subject of liberalism.

3This is not a new insight. Simple, unending, unrestricted iteration, simple, unending, unrestricted amalgamation has been photography’s cross to bear from the beginning and, as such, it has always born the cross’s promise of torment and redemption both. We might remind ourselves of the far-reaching implications of this role by adapting some wording from Alain Badiou: “Since it is sure of its ability to control the entire domain of the visible”—he says of capitalism generally but, for our purposes, we can narrow to its indiscriminate, all-consuming, photographic gaze—it “no longer censures anything.” By accepting this “permission to consume, to communicate and to enjoy,” he says, all “art, and all thought, is ruined” and the only remaining way to experience redemption rather than the unending low-grade torment of the progressive devaluation of everything is to become “pitiless censors of ourselves.”1Put differently, we might say that when photography is experienced with the ease of guilty pleasure—as staring, for example, or shopping, or as voyeurism or surveillance, or as the simple, unbridled promiscuity of vision that scrutinizes everything and anything—it presents us with the torment of the consumer’s alienation, the torment of the commodification of vision. By contrast, when it is experienced with the more taciturn pleasure of guilt—as the pleasure of a chaste vision or vision contained by the discrimination of taste, moral reasoning, or political purpose—it promises redemption. Of course, this does not mean that censure or chastity or taste are themselves good. Rather it means working out rightful restraints for the natural licentiousness of photography’s mechanical means is the only way to resuscitate the promise that inheres in all art and all thought.
4This general theme of photography as loss, photography as dissipation of the promise of art and thought in its mechanically accelerated proliferation of images, is touched on one way or another by most of the volumes in the series, and it cuts several ways. For example, while Maria Golia offers a kind of high bar for art and thought in Photography and Egypt when she quotes André Malraux’s adage that “Egypt invented eternity,” she says this only to point out that, by the time of the opening of Tutankhamun’s tomb in 1923, the “commodification of Egypt’s antiquities, with photography as mediator, was complete.” (Photography and Egypt, 31, 39) It goes without saying that it was not just pyramids and other figures of eternity that photography would make into tchotchkes: in the wake of the simultaneous influx of tourism and George Eastman’s film and processing business, travel guides would inevitably advise visiting Europeans and Americans that it was “poor Egyptians” who make for “the most kodakable attitudes and occupations.” (Photography and Egypt, 60) She makes a similar argument about indigenous photography, tracing it from its early, heady days at the dawn of the twentieth century as a form of popular sovereignty to its subsequent domination by the post-revolutionary state. Responding to the familiar argument that photography teaches us to see the world freshly, she concludes that it might be better understood as “a process through which we have grown accustomed, over time, to see less, or not at all.” (Photography and Egypt, 63)
5John Harvey makes a related point about spirit photography in his Photography and Spirit: “The democratization of photography, like that of the Bible during the Protestant Reformation,” he explains, “implied a loss of an authoritative interpretation and manipulation by an elite.” Without the mediating role of art and the institutions that governed its aesthetic claims, or religion and the institutions that governed its spiritual claims, spirit photography came to mean many different things to many different people. Spirit, like beauty, faced a gross inflationary pressure or a loss in value as the sheer number of spirit images and spirit image-makers multiplied many fold. As a result, photography’s effect on the idea of spirit would be like capitalism’s more broadly on Christianity. Instead of seeing spirit anew, Harvey tells us, “the image of the spirit proliferated and disintegrated,” no doubt contributing, it might be added, to our late modern inability to see spirit at all. (Photography and Spirit, 144)
6Kelley Wilder tracks a similar loss of substance in Photography and Science.In the “first, pre-photographic decades of the nineteenth century,” she writes, the mantle of “observer” called up the high purpose of Enlightenment science in the work of Jean Senebier or Carl Linneaus, or even that of the Renaissance fusion of art and science in the work of Leonardo and Michelangelo. (Photography and Science, 18) That is, scientific observation in its modern, pre-photographic form aspired to an active, synthetic intelligence that not only took note of the world accurately but also made sense of it through a process of progressive and integrative accumulation of insight. This would change significantly under the influence of photography as observation came to be rendered passive, positivistic, mechanical, and devoid of art and thought. In Wilder’s view like that of Harvey and Golia, thus, photography’s machine-like vision came to stand for a loss of the enlarged humanistic vision that was just coming into it own in the name of renaissance and enlightenment and, thus, a loss of the promise of art and thought as new and improved substitutes for the older universalism of divine revelation. Vision that had been a passive receptacle for the revelations of God before the humanism of Renaissance and Enlightenment activated it, in other words, would be returned to its premodern passivity by photography in the face of a mute, mechanical nature. “This rhetoric of passivity,” she writes, “would have the artist rendered obsolete, the hand uninvolved, the imagination untapped.” (Photography and Science, 55) Such understanding would come under considerable pressure from scientific and artistic developments, particularly after the onset of the twentieth century, but it would also live on as both a point of tension and site of promise.
7Indeed, as with the two-sided nature of the Christian cross, there has always been a companion view that suggests that photography’s mechanical, reductive quality was not only a travesty of the burgeoning human potential promised by the Renaissance and the Enlightenment but also a blessing, and for the very same reason that it was a loss or depletion of that human potential. As a rule, social abstraction always cuts two ways. On the one hand, it inevitably dehistoricizes, dehumanizes, and degrades by reducing people to cogs or units or numbers or simple iterations and thereby diminishes the significance of their particularities, their individualities. Photography abstracts in this way with its unceasing proliferation of one photograph after another in an incessant production of trivial difference. On the other hand, abstraction also has the potential to historicize, humanize, and dignify by creating the base condition for collective identification. As cogs, units, numbers, or iterations, we share common purpose in our united systematicity—the critical question, of course, is the character of that purpose. To put it in Badiouian terms, the endpoint of abstraction is the empty set—a condition that photography may gravitate to better than any other medium or form because of its dramatically productive and radically decentralized multiplicity—and as such it stands for a condition of sociality or social self-understanding whose purpose is yet to be determined.
8This promise of photographically derived sociality is also a theme taken up in one or way or another in many of the volumes in the series but I will highlight just two. We can cast that promise with François Brunet as being in a state of tension between index and icon. Photography, as he has it, has always been understood as a tradeoff between nineteenth-century concepts of science and art, between “a technically and socially based standard of (visual) truth” and a “culturally sanctioned expression of the creative self,” or between photography’s innate “‘we’, the discourse of nature and society,” and post-Romantic literature’s hard-wrought “I” or the discourse of “individual expression.” (Photography and Literature, 10-11) In its most reduced form, this is a battle between the general and the particular, or between the systematic standards provided by religion, science, and socialism, on one side, and the free-ranging standards developed by liberalism’s individualized expressive subject, on the other. What photography promises as index rather than icon, or as absence of the individual expressive subject rather than its presence, thus, is something like the possibility of a rebirth of enlightenment, a rebirth of emergent social being, against its profanation in the market. Brunet labels this “photography’s point of view” to distinguish it from the points of view given by individual photographers or photographs and concludes his volume by linking its “ethics of photographic abstention” to Walter Benjamin’s notion of the optical unconscious. (Photography and Literature, 150) On its own, this point of view promises nothing more than an empty set, of course, but as such it is a promise of systematicity and, thus, sociality nonetheless.
9In a related manner, David Campany takes up the opposition between the narrative temporality of film and the pause or suspension of that temporality by the still photograph. Drawing on Raymond Bellour and Roland Barthes, he refers to that suspension of time as “pensive,” as a moment of anticipation “when things are in the balance.” (Photography and Cinema, 96) This balancing act is the same one we have been addressing: between part and whole or between the alienation of the liberal subject who experiences herself as a social fragment, on the one hand, and the alienation of the empty set or abstract social being, on the other. Where photography would initially seem to play the role of the fragment in this opposition, and film that of the composite whole, these positions are effectively reversed as we come to understand the narrativization of film as a particularization, as a single story that closes down on the possibility of other narratives. A photograph, on the other hand, because it opens up the question of its relation to any and all other photographs as if they were all frames in a giant omnidirectional film, invokes the question of the whole. In short, photography provides the necessary abstraction, or abstention, or capacity to be Badiouian “pitiless censors of ourselves” such that we might see the forest for the trees. As Campany puts it in the context of the film-still photography of Cindy Sherman and Jeff Wall, “Only when it is stilled do we have the necessary distance to contemplate the filmic-ness of film.” (Photography and Cinema, 135)

10Because the Exposures series presents us with the idea that the meaning of photography is in principle endless and unbounded, it raises a productive question about photography’s ontology. Photography is uniquely well suited to address mereological questions—questions about the relation between part and whole—that are neither the matter of cultural identity, on the one hand, nor that of the individual consumer’s self-differentiation and self-adaptation in the open market, on the other. Photographs exist in dynamic relation to each other and that relation is one of value that is difficult to dissolve completely into the molten realm of market exchange. Photography has always been a social medium, in other words, and in ways that art never was. In this regard, it is never only fragmented personal meaning, on the one hand, and a generalized superstore of enticing and distracting society-of-the-spectacle commodities, on the other, but also a semiotic and socio-affective factory. As Marx said about factories generally, “Not only do we have here an increase in the productive power of the individual, by means of cooperation, but the creation of a new productive power, which is intrinsically a collective one.”2Factories make production more efficient and thus more powerful, of course, but they also create a productive subject—that of collective production itself—with the capacity to use its enhanced power on behalf of the factory owner or for itself. Photography’s great promise, like its great threat, arises from this factory-like quality: its endless proliferation of “exposures,” its homogenization and liberalization of value, its distinctively modern power of social abstraction, its opening up of the possibility for alternative collective forms. Like Twitter and Facebook in the run of uprisings in North Africa and the Middle East, so with photography: it is a power in the balance, a socially productive force ever waiting to come into its own.

As you know, I've been pretty quiet since 2010 on the French Immersion issue. That's because I had my say when I was Education Minister, and I thought it was best that the debate happen with other voices. Plus, frankly, there are many other issues.
Now that the decision has been made, I'm going to dedicate three blog posts this week to the issue. Not in debating it, but hopefully adding a couple of dimensions to the public debate from someone who got a crash course in it when that report hit my desk in 2008.
Later, I will look at where it fits in the broader language debate, and what issues the government will have to look at in the transition back to Grade 1. This post will look at what we know after ten years worth of students starting EFI in Grade 3, and what we don't know yet. I thought it might be helpful because the government hasn't really explained the thinking behind the change – what they thought wasn't working, what they hope to achieve. I think we are in a post-persuasion era in politics, where our ministers minimize appearances so as not to antagonize us with arguments. Still, there is a void in reviewing facts, and as much as anyone I was interested in what we found out.
ISSUE ONE: PARTICPATION IN EFI
One issue is the availability of immersion programming. If too few people have access to immersion, then it becomes a source of tension and inequality. These numbers surprised me – with Grade 1 immersion, there was a consistent rate of about 29-31% of anglophone students taking EFI. That's been steadily growing, hitting a high of 42% of students taking the new Grade 3 immersion programme.
Why? Well, literacy experts did tell us that they thought that many students were struggling in unequal classrooms – since very few students with special needs or from poor families took EFI, we were basically skimming off the top third of learners and leaving behind non-immersion classes where a very high percentage of students had learning challenges. The theory was that leaving classes unstreamed until Grade 3 would help more learners get individual help and be more comfortable taking EFI in Grade 3.
Of course, this has a spiral effect – the more marginal learners choose EFI, the more numbers go up, and with higher numbers comes more communities where the number of students taking immersion is high enough to offer EFI. So this may not just be individuals – we may be seeing more communities get Grade 3 EFI than got Grade 1. This will be a statistic worth tracking when we change back.
ISSUE 2: Sticking with EFI
The biggest surprise was here. Before, we always saw some big declines as students struggle in EFI and drop into the non-immersion stream. There are some reasons for this. While many argue persuasively that struggles in literacy can be dealt with just as well in the immersion setting, many parents respond to struggles by removing the child from EFI. This isn't totally irrational – there are few trained intervention workers in EFI, and unilingual parents feel sidelined from helping at home if instruction isn't in English.
As we can see, the old Grade 1 programme lost about 16% of students after two years, and about 21% of kids by Grade 5. The new programme, starting in Grade 3, had that attrition rate down to 8.93% in the last measured year, 2015.
Why? Assuming students leave EFI if they struggle, it may be that giving teachers two unstreamed years to work with students made them more ready to learn a second language, or just more confident in general. I'd love to learn more about why this is happening from experts.
So we can say that delaying the entry point to Grade 3 meant more students taking EFI and staying with it. Of course, that leads us to the big question….
ISSUE 3: FRENCH LANGUAGE ACQUiSITION
This was the big tradeoff. The thinking in waiting to Grade 3 was that we could get more students learning to read and write their first language and thus ready to learn, and this would compensate for the delay in starting immersion. There were smart people who were skeptical. Because the first Grade 3 immersion class hasn't been tested yet, we simply don't know how their French skills stacked up to their Grade 1-starting peers.
You can debate whether or not government should change without testing how the current system was working. I'm sticking with facts, and we just don't know. But of course, over time, we will have ten cohorts of Grade 3 immersion students and we will know.
ISSUE 4: Teacher Support
You know this one. When the change was made, an NBTA survey showed 67% of teachers supported the move to Grade 3. Then-President Brent Shaw explained that, in deference to the strong contrary sentiment among EFI teachers, the Association stayed publicly neutral. And we all know that the NBTA has not been neutral this year – the Teachers’ Association supported staying at Grade 3 having been the ones to implement it for eight years.
ISSUE 5: Impact on English Literacy
The biggest reason for the change was that eliminating streaming might help our low literacy rates. In a system where up to 40% of kids enter school with learning challenges and 98% of them don't take EFI, that meant non-immersion classes where over half the room struggled.
This still is misunderstood, which you can blame on the minister who was explaining it. People asked why we thought waiting to Grade 3 would help improve the results of learning French. We thought it would help most with English, because struggling learners wouldn't get lost in classrooms where teachers had too many students with high needs.
So, I had a look at the Grade 2 literacy results before and after. And, the results were interesting but unclear. Sorry about the self-serving table. I'm not a detached observer, but the numbers are the Department’s and not mine.
So what do we get from this? First of all, Bernard Lord was underrated – big improvements happened under the Quality Learning Agenda. I'm even happier we kept his testing regime instead of tearing it up to be partisan.
On EFI? It's inconclusive. Supporters of the Grade 3 point can indeed note that the best literacy score in NB history was the first class to not be streamed. There is a jump there.
Supporters of the Grade 1 point will note that things have gone down again to where they were back in the days of Grade 1 EFI and early streaming. Now, there are a lot of other changes – government also began cutting in 2011 and has been cutting since, and other things like literacy mentors and teacher innovation funds were specifically cut. You could argue that not streaming helped and is still making it better than it would be, but programme cuts are bringing the rate down. Of course, you could also argue that in 2008 there were good programmes and more money, and these “good Kelly” programmes caused the rise, not the “bad Kelly” change to the EFI entry point. Or maybe kids learn better when education ministers are over 6’4”. (Doubt it).
We will likely know more by tracking these after the change. That will tell us a lot more about what caused the rise from 2007-10. Governments haven't been reporting these with as much fanfare, so I hope citizens and journalists will ask.
CONCLUSION
Obviously, I have a dog in this fight, and I've tried to avoid argument here. Like all of you, I want the system to work, and that is most likely when we start by acknowledging the facts we know and the ones we need to find out. I've hoped every day that the decision of 2008 served kids well, at least as many as possible. And I hope the new policy does, too. This is too important to worry about ego. Let's all try to get it right.Waste of community property may result in jointly owned community property not being divided evenly by an Arizona court upon a marital dissolution.
Since Arizona is a community property state, property acquired during a marriage is generally deemed to be jointly owned by both parties and, upon divorce, is to be divided evenly. Exceptions do exist. In dividing marital assets and debts, courts can give consideration to excessive or abnormal expenditures by one spouse that amount to squandering jointly held property. The squandering of assets by a spouse, which is referred to as waste, may mean that the spouse committing waste will be allocated less property upon a divorce.
In an article published in the Journal of the Academy of Matrimonial Attorneys, the author observes that the following expenditures by one spouse, without the permission of the other spouse, have been found to constitute community waste: (1) gambling; (2) a failure to make mortgage or tax payments resulting in a foreclosure; (3) alcohol- and drug-related expenses; and (4) expenses incurred in furthering extramarital affairs.
A good example of an Arizona case where waste was found is Gutierrez v. Gutierrez. There, the husband withdrew approximately $62,000 from the community retirement account without his wife's knowledge and was unable to explain how he had spent such a large sum of money. What was clear was that the expenditures were excessive, abnormal and did not benefit the community.
The Gazeley case
The recently decided case of Gazeley v. Larsen-Gazeley illustrates how the courts deal with claims of community waste. In Gazeley, a wife appealed from a marital dissolution decree and asserted that the trial court had improperly denied her claim for waste. The Arizona Court of Appeals emphasized that a spouse alleging community waste by the other spouse has the burden of showing evidence of waste after which the other spouse can present evidence in rebuttal.
At trial, the wife presented evidence in the form of a compilation of expenditures from a checking account, several credit cards and a PayPal account. The exhibit showed numerous transactions in a little less than two years totaling $92,559.04. The wife testified that the credit card charges were for places and restaurants she had never visited and for items she had never received. She suggested that, because her husband was having an affair during the time period in question, the monies were spent furthering the extramarital affair.
The husband denied community waste and testified that some of the expenditures in question were from taking clients to lunch, business travel, buying a present for his wife and his wife's Lasik surgery. He produced evidence that at least some of the charges were business expenses and that several of the checks in question were written to-and cashed by-his wife.
The court found no evidence of abnormal transactions. Further, the number of transactions did not, by itself, suggest that they were anything other than normal living expenditures. All in all, said the court, the wife's waste claims were highly speculative. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in concluding that the wife had failed to prove her claim of waste. Gazeley illustrates that, if a party charged with waste provides a reasonable explanation for expenditures, a trial court does not abuse its discretion in finding that no waste occurred.

Lately I’ve been learning C++ and coming from languages like Java and C#, it’s quite a transition. I’ve been meaning to get started with C++ for a while now, but never really got to it. In that time, there has been lots of talk to whereas the language would be a big step, because of the complicated aspects one doesn’t have in Java-like languages.
The biggest difference between C++ and Java can pretty much be described as one thing: memory management. The handling of available memory is almost completely abstracted away when using Java, you only have to worry about not overloading the device you’re developing on, which is rarely a problem when developing desktop applications. In C++, however, the allocation of memory is done for you, but releasing it is not.
Consider the following piece of code:
public void changeGear(int gear) { Gearbox gb = new Gearbox(); gb.setGear(gear); }
This is a simple piece of code, which would work flawlessly in Java-like languages. A new object of the type ‘Gearbox’ is created, a method from that object is called and the method is done. In C++, this method would cause severe problems in some cases. First of all, the object is created on the stack instead of the heap. If you want to know more about stack an heap, take a look at this post. Actually, this code wouldn’t run at all, but I’ll come back to that in a bit.
public void changeGear(int gear) { Gearbox* gb = new Gearbox(); gb->setGear(gear); }
Two things have changed: the type of the object is appended with an asterisk * and the method call is done through an arrow -> instead of a period.
What this does, is create a new object of type Gearbox on the heap and store a reference to that object on the stack, named 'gb’. In Java one would say “I have an object of type 'Gearbox’ called 'gb’”, but in C++, this would be “I have a reference called 'gb’ to an object of type 'Gearbox’. The variable named 'gb’ really is a number, namely the address of the piece of memory the object resides in. The asterisk indicates it is a reference to an object of type Gearbox instead of an object of type Gearbox. This is also called a 'Pointer’.
Because the 'gb’ variable no longer is the actual Gearbox object, we can’t use the period notation to call methods on it, it’s not an object after all. So what we can do to access the object’s members, is use the arrow -> notation. The third line of code tells the compiler to "get the object referenced by the 'gb’ variable and call it’s method named 'setGear’”. So where the period could be described as “get the following member of this object”, the arrow could be described as “get the following member of the object referenced by this variable”.
Earlier, I mentioned the code in the first snippet wouldn’t work at all C++. This is because the 'new’ keyword creates a new object on the stack and returns a reference to this object. As shown above, such a reference is represented by appending an asterisk to the type of the object (Gearbox*). The variable 'gb’ in the first snippet doesn’t have this asterisk (Gearbox). The syntax for creating an object on the stack looks like this:
public void changeGear(int gear) { Gearbox gb; gb.setGear(gear); }
This may seem quite unusual, as if we’re declaring an object without instantiating it. Still, the object really gets instantiated, assuming it has a constructor with no parameters (also known as a default constructor). If it does have one or more parameters, the code becomes like this:
public void changeGear(int gear) { Gearbox gb(6); gb.setGear(gear); }
So much for the first issue.
Secondly, the object stays in memory, even after the method is done. While Java releases any reserved memory within the current scope, at the end of the scope, C++ does not. We need to add a command to do that:
public void changeGear(int gear) { Gearbox* gb = new Gearbox(); gb->setGear(gear); delete gb; }
Now, the memory manager will release the bit of memory used for the Gearbox object.
When a piece of memory is 'released’, it becomes available for allocation at another point in your application’s execution. The memory itself is not modified, so it retains its data. The problem of this method is, that when the piece of memory is allocated a second time, there’s no way of telling what will be in there. Take a look at the following code:
public void enableWiper() { SoapReservoir* soapRes; }
In the above snippet, we’re enabling the wipers, to clean the windshield. Before we enable the wipers, we’ll check whether there’s enough soap in the reservoir. Now suppose we first declare the soapRes variable, before we’re going to assign it a value. In Java, the variable would have a value of null. In C++, you never know what soapRes’ value will be.
This is because the piece of memory reserved to contain the value of soapRes probably has some leftover data, which could have been another type like a float, or maybe even part of an object. To ensure the default value, the variable must be assigned.
public void enableWiper() { SoapReservoir* soapRes = NULL; }
This is useful for situations where you want to check whether an object is set or not:
public void turnOnRadio() { // Check if we even have a radio if(radio != NULL) { radio.turnOn(); } }
If the radio object hasn’t been assigned the NULL value on declaration, it will not be null, while the variable hasn’t been assigned. This will cause the above code to think there actually is a radio object and throw an exception when the radio object doesn’t appear to have a method called turnOn(), or alternatively, the application crashes.
That’s about it for the basics, next time I’ll talk about object orientation in C++. Going to sleep now :)Hyuna Joins The High-Fashion Club

Sunday, November 15, 2009The GalCiv II campaign has been a lot tougher to do than we had thought it would be. A couple years ago, we whipped up a campaign for the GalCiv expansion pack called Altarian Prophecy and so this time around we thought it would be pretty much the same except we'd make it more dynamic where you could lose missions and go to alternative missions instead.
We were wrong.
It's all in the balancing. First of all, the main feature of GalCiv II is the stand alone "sand box" games. That is, the randomly generated games where the player is making up the story. For me, as a player that's the whole point of the game -- to have a strategy game where I'm making my own mythology as I play along. To "role play" if you will. So one of the things we quickly changed was how long the campaign took to play. Originally it was going to be an ungodly # of missions. But then that puts most of the game play (and reviewer's time) put into the campaign because reviewers will feel they need to "finish" the campaign in order to review the game adequately. But we don't want the campaign to be the main part of the game.
At the same time, we do want the campaign to be awesome. And having done a lot of campaigns over the years, I know which types of missions I like and which ones I don't like. Escort missions, protect the item, etc.:Yuck. Blow up and kill things: Good.
Another thing I noticed is that whenever you have an impossible to defeat enemy that you've built up, sci-fi tends to end up with the good guys winning by some trick. In Star Trek, best of both worlds, the unstoppable Borg were only stopped due to the Enterprise being able to put the Borg to sleep. No way.
The Dread Lords gotta be tough. But they have to have a very obvious and reasonable weakness to exploit. One that makes sense to the player and can be represented in-game. We came up with that weakness: They're so technologically advanced that it takes them a very long time to actually build things.
Let's face it, if the US military conquered an ancient city, it's not like they could quickly convert ancient Rome into cranking out new MFVs overnight. The Dread Lords suffer the same problem except they're millions of years more advanced. So when they arrive, they have this issue -- they have a handful of ships which are deadlier than anything else out there. But these planets -- so primitive. Look at these humans and Arceans and what not, still use non-organic ships. Still throwing trivial bits of energy about. Still using their people to do labor.
I've zoomed out into strategic mode to show the area in question. The blue ships are my fleet that I'm sending in. The red thing at the upper left is a single Dread Lord Dreadnought. That single ship will wipe out my fleet but it'll hurt it good and there's no quick replacements for the Dread Lords.
The other issue to have them be super powerful but not unstoppable are raw numbers. There just aren't very many of them. So when they do finally invade a planet, there's only a a dozen of them versus 5 million troops. Obviously we had to put together a special invasion effect to convey 10 guys wiping out 5 million troops. But each of these Dread Lords is as powerful as Sauron. You can take them out, it's just hard.
So I spent the entire weekend tweaking the Dread Lord AI to make them tough but not unstoppable. This is harder than one might think.
In the campaign mission, Apocalypse, it's basically everyone versus the Dread Lords. So here's the design challenge: You want to make a mission in which IF the player doesn't do anything that the Dread Lords will win. BUT if the human plays decently the Dread Lords will lose.
So you can picture playing this mission over..and..over...and over.. tuning it. For some hours, the Dread Lords were too nerfed and eventually, just by hitting the turn button, the Dread Lords would be taken out by someone else. So then I build them up and pretty soon they're conquering the universe and there's no stopping them. The human player, even me, gets wiped out. So all kinds of tweaks were made until I finally started homing in on the Dread Lord weakness and making sure that was carried to its logical end -- they produce ships slowly and their ships are not as powerful as they might be (early on, that Dreadnought has a 200 attack -- if you get far enough in the tech tree, you can build incredibly powerful ships). So I have to restrict how much they can put on their ships (that's where a lot of time went -- just how powerful are their ships).
Similarly, you have to decide how powerful their troops are. You want to make it reasonably possible to invade their worlds if you get through their defenses but you still want their forces to be immensely tough when they do the invading. But not too tough mind you. 10 guys wiping out 5 million troops is fine. 10 guys wiping out 10 million becomes imbalancing.
|I apologize for the blocky graphics, I have all the effects/smoothing turned-off for debug.
By 2231 in the campaign mission, which starts you out with a lot of techs (one other thing we've done a lot of work on is making is to that players get increasing amounts of tech each mission - no one wants to have to keep researching "space militarization over and over"). The idea is you "keep" some of the techs you get from the previous mission. But even with a lot of effort, my top of the line ship is 16 missile attack and 2 armor. Which is another thing I did to the Dread Lords. They only get to "Adapt" ONE time. That is, they don't get to change their ship designs like normal players. Their infrastructure barely supports creating their advanced organic ships to begin with let alone switching from Doom Rays to Mass Drivers later on. So they will adapt one time and that's it -- though they get to pick when. Still my pitiful 16 missile attack is not going to stand up to a Dread Lord when they're doing 52 attack with beam.
They already did their adaption and made useless my entire line of beam-based ships. My "EarthForce" heavy fighters were all based on beam weapons and the Dread Lords now equip their ships with a standard 20unit shield defense making my plasma beams pointless. So I had to start my way up the tech tree for missiles and it's been a real race. One of the recent (i.e. last week) changes is that we made it so that each new tech you get makes the next tech a bit more expensive. Not massively mind you but later on in the game when you've built up a massive technology industry it's not right that a player could just whiz through the missile techs (like I'm trying to). So instead of it taking 1 week to get Stinger II missile tech it's taking me 3 weeks. Not a huge deal but it definitely puts some meat into the "You pick your weapons and defenses and you live with it."
So you can (like I'm doing) switch to another weapon technology but you're not going to whiz through in 5 turns. It's going to take a bit of time. We did give something in return though -- no research wastage. When you research a tech, the excess technology production is automatically put into the next tech in the line. So when I first started up on the really early weapons stuff, I was getting 2 or 3 techs in a single turn which was nice.
The other penalty I put on the Dread Lords is that they have a relatively low logistics ability. They can't coordinate their ships. That way, the player isn't faced with a fleet of Dreadnoughts. It's usually a single ship or a couple ships at most. But if you research enough logistics, you can put together a death fleet which is what I've done.
My 6 ships include 3 Battleship-level ships. Enough to kill off any Dread Lord.
Which it was. But in rare incident, the Dread Lords had two ships together and one of those Dread Lords was destroyed but the rest of my fleet was wiped out. It was quite a battle though. I have to say, there's something humbling about seeing not just one but three of your state of the art, large hulled, armed to the teeth designs being destroyed.
This brings me to map design. At the end of this, the player will win if they know what they're doing (and each mission has its own difficulty slider). But part of the key was making sure the player wasn't in the action. We have, literally "human shields". Other civilizations who are in the way. Namely, these guys:
By the time I'm done, they're gone. I wish I could show you the Dread Lords battle but the PR people want me to wait and as a way of thanking IGN for their really cool coverage we're going to have the first shots be in there when we talk about the Dread Lords. They have ridiculously cool ships that make the most of 1000 polygon models, bump mapping, and normal mapping and high definition textures plus they have the high end weapons (the weapon effects get better as you go up the tech tree).
The other "timer" is that the Drengin and Yor are on this map. They are at war with the Dread Lords too but the Dread Lords aren't as interested in them as they are you and your allies. So while you and your friends are dealing with the Dread Lords, the Drengin/Yor alliance is slowly encroaching in.
In my mind, this one is the "toughest" mission in the campaign. But on the other hand, it should be the toughest. This is the pay off, to match yourself to the Dread Lords. There's no "trick" to it, it's just good old fashioned strategy gaming.Bedroom Decorating Ideas

Council Minutes, Regular Meeting March 4, 2013
Council Chambers 9:11 p.m.
Paul Koomar, President of Council, presiding
Present: Clark, Koomar, Lee, Lieske, Miller, Tadych, Young, Mayor Sutherland
Others
Present: Law Director Ebert, Finance Director Mahoney, Recreation Director Enovitch, Service Director Galli, Community Services Director Bock, Operations Manager Landers
President of Council Koomar called the meeting to order at 9:11 p.m. in the Council Chambers of Bay Village City Hall, with the Pledge of Allegiance led by Michael Young, Councilman, Ward 4.
Following the roll call, Mr. Koomar called for a reading of the Minutes of the Special Meeting of Council held February 25, 2013. Mr. Young MOVED to dispense with the reading and accept the minutes as prepared and distributed. Motion carried 7-0.
REPORTS
Law Director Ebert had no report this evening.
Finance Director Mahoney had no report this evening.
Recreation Director Enovitch stated that on Saturday, March 16, 2013 the Easter Bunny Hop will be held at the Middle School Community Gym at 11:00 a.m. The Bay Village Recreation Department Spring and Summer Program Brochure will be mailed to residents within the next two weeks.
Mr. Koomar asked if pool passes will be available on line this year. Mr. Enovitch stated that pool memberships are not available on line due to the necessity to prove residency.
Director of Community Services Bock had no report this evening.
Nancy Brown asked if Mayor Sutherland or Finance Director Mahoney had any updates on the funding reimbursement claim submitted for Hurricane Sandy damages in the city.
Mrs. Mahoney stated that she met last week with representatives from Federal Emergency Management who are going to work with Mrs. Mahoney in submitting the reports. Mrs. Mahoney noted that the process has been started. It is estimated that claims for approximately $100,000 will be submitted.
Ms. Brown asked the process for street snow plowing. Mayor Sutherland stated that normally the process begins when the Police Department notifies the Service Department that conditions are becoming slippery. Operation Manager Landers and his staff then go into action calling in crews. If it is known in advance that a major storm event is approaching, the Service Department will pre-treat the roads and have people on call. The call-in is based on a three hour minimum. Ms. Brown asked how many people would be called in for a snow event. Mr. Landers stated that depending on the severity of the conditions, from 5 to 11 workers are called in. For a salting only event, up to 5 employees are called in. If it is a heavy snow event with city-wide plowing, up to 11 workers are called in.
Kent Silverberg, 24425 East Oakland, stated that in light of recent media events, he is hoping that the city will reconsider ordinances regarding residential cameras and their aim at neighboring homeowners’ property. This would alleviate a lot of pain and suffering that Council, Mr. Silverberg personally, and a lot of the other Bay Village residents have been through.
Mr. Silverberg stated that a highly publicized court case was held wherein the defendants were sentenced. Unfortunately there was no representation by the city. Mr. Silverberg stated that he was saddened to see that because he does not think the residents were protected from what had happened. The sentencing did not go their way or the way the city would have liked.
Law Director Ebert stated that City of Bay Village Prosecutor Gary Hotz did call him regarding the case. There was a prior pre-trial discussion concerning what the court was looking at and what the city wanted. There is also a private case downtown that actually is the controlling factor. It has more teeth than anything Judge Hagen could do in Rocky River Court. There was discussion at the pre-trial, about two weeks prior to the hearing. The fact that Mr. Hotz was not present did not have any bearing on the case. Mr. Ebert attended the previous pre-trial with Mr. Hotz. The case downtown has the teeth that can be enforced by the Police Department, if it is a violation of the restraining order.
Mr. Silverberg stated that the violation of the civil court order was The City of Bay Village versus the Barringers. Mr. Ebert stated that the city did not file a civil action. That is a protection order. The city does not have standing downtown. A protective order is with the Court of Common Pleas. There was ample discussion at the pre-trial.
Evan O’Malley, 24801 East Oakland, stated that four years ago he addressed Council regarding deer. He would like to make the Council and Mayor aware that the deer situation is an issue in this city, and is an issue regionally. The Council minutes of February 11 relate that Mr. Clark and Mr. Tadych spoke with the Avon Lake Police Department about the 60 reported deer accidents the last two years in Avon Lake, a majority of which were on Walker Road. The Avon Lake Service Department picked up 44 dead deer. A few years ago, Bay Village Police Chief David Wright stated that there 8 deer/automobile accidents. Mr. O’Malley would like to receive the data from Bay Village as to deer accidents, and if the city is picking up a lot of deer. Mayor Sutherland stated that this information will be obtained for Mr. O’Malley. Mr. O’Malley continued, stating that the key points in deer related issues are the car accidents, the encounters with people, and disease. There are eight deer behind their homes on East Oakland. A residents’ five-year-old granddaughter was approached by a buck within a few feet, which could have resulted in the child being kicked, injured, or killed. Mr. O’Malley acknowledged that deer culling is difficult, although it has been successfully accomplished in Solon, Ohio. Research indicates that over 200 people a year in the United States die in crashes caused by deer. State Farm Insurance has estimated that deer hit 1.23 million vehicles between July, 2011 and June of 2012. Over the past four years, deer hits have risen over 8%. It is an issue and if Bay doesn’t do anything or look into it, and someone gets killed or injured, the question may be asked why the city didn’t do anything.
Operation Manager Landers stated that there are one or two deer per month, if that, picked up by the Service Department. Mayor Sutherland stated that it is difficult to say where the deer were injured. They may have been hit on the freeway and walked up the creek before dying.
Mr. Ebert stated that this is something that the city has looked at and talked about. Avon Lake was going to authorize deer culling by bow and arrow but the ordinance was pulled off the agenda because residents were concerned about the proximity of the homes. A police recommendation in Bay Village was that there would be a potential cause of problems having sharp shooters come in to the densely populated area of Bay Village. The issue has been discussed frequently. Council passed an ordinance last year prohibiting the feeding of deer.
Mr. O’Malley stated he realizes this is a complex issue. He encouraged there be discussion for something to be done, even regionally or state wide with possible funding. People are still feeding the deer which causes the population to grow. The deer cause enormous financial damage as well, including loss of business to local plant providers and resale of homes due to negative curb appeal caused by damaged or missing landscaping.
Mr. O’Malley asked about the commuter rail discussion held last October at a meeting of officials of Bay Village, Lakewood, Cleveland and Olmsted Falls.
Law Director Ebert stated that the reason that Bay Village was invited is because the city has an agreement with the railroad prohibiting the number of trains that can go through Bay Village without the railroad being fined. The agreement did not terminate at its tenth anniversary; it has no expiration date. At that meeting, the issue of the possibility of commuter rail came up, and whether the West Shore cities would be opposed to it because of the agreement. Mr. Ebert stated that the presentation was made that the city is not against commuter rail as long as it does not impact the agreement with the railroad. The railroad, at that meeting, assured everyone that they would not stand in the way of commuter rail. The problem is that commuter rail would have to make an agreement with the railroad for the use of the rail. There hasn’t been any further movement on this topic since then. No one has contacted the City of Bay Village recently. Our agreement stands in place. Rocky River, Lakewood, and Bay Village’s agreement is not going to be hindered in any way. The cities agreed not to stand in the way but there has been no further impetus to move the commuter rail forward.
Mayor Sutherland added that a commuter rail study was done with the Northeast Ohio Areawide Coordinating Agency approximately ten years ago. The cost for ridership was astronomical. Mayor Sutherland asked who would be funding the commuter rail and was informed that it would be the communities. Taxes would have to be raised because it wouldn’t get funded any other way.
Mr. O’Malley stated that he was concerned because he likes the agreement that the city has that limits the number of trains through Bay Village. Mr. Ebert noted that the agreement has stood the test of time. The highest number of trains per day through Bay Village averages between 2 and 3 trains per day with this agreement.
Mr. Clark encouraged Mr. O’Malley to report any violations of the deer feeding ordinance.
Nancy Brown informed Mr. O’Malley that a copy of a report of the animal activity that goes on in Bay Village is available from Mrs. Helen Miller at the Bay Village Police Department. Mrs. Miller will email a report, which she does every two weeks to those interested. The report includes activity including squirrels, chipmunks, dogs, and deer. If the deer are injured and don’t run off on their own, the police are called to euthanize the deer and the Service Department removes the animal. Ms. Brown stated that regarding the feeding ordinance, it is her understanding that the police officer has to specifically see a resident feeding the deer to issue a citation.
Ms. Brown asked Mr. Ebert if he has received her emails regarding Superstorm Sandy. Mr. Ebert stated that he did receive Ms. Brown’s emails and should have something by the end of the week.
Mr. O’Malley reiterated that the citizens of Bay Village need to know that the officials of the city know that there are deer issues regarding safety, disease, and incidents of physical encounters with deer and children and adults.
In compliance with Section 121.22 of the Ohio Revised Code, Mr. Young MOVED to adjourn to Executive Session regarding labor contracts, contracts, personnel, and litigation, at 10:00 p.m.

ANNOUNCEMENTS
Mayor Sutherland advised that last week Bay Village was featured on the Yahoo landing page for the property values being very stable.
Kyle Hyland, who grew up in Bay Village and played soccer for the Bay Schools, will be playing professionally for the Columbus Crew.
The State of the City address has been changed to May 7, 2013 and will be held at LaCentre in Westlake.
A letter was received today from Cuyahoga County Executive Ed Fitzgerald advising that due to the fact that Cuyahoga Community municipalities were overcharged on the property appraisal process, the City of Bay Village will be receiving a refund of $17,700.30.
The Cahoon Road Aerial Sewer Project is done and working well. Minor items such as tree lawn work will be done in the spring.
The engineering for the Cahoon Road Sewer Replacement Project is almost completed, and the city is getting ready to move forward with that project.
The Ohio Department of Transportation has advised that they will provide 85% funding for Lake Road resurfacing from Longbeach to the westerly border of Bay Village.
Mayor Sutherland stated that her kudos this evening go to employee Curtis Krakowski for his inspections and project management of the Cahoon Aerial Sewer Project, noting that Mr. Krakowski has saved the city tens of thousands of dollars in inspection and architectural fees.
Jerrie Barnett, 316 Bayview Road, stated that she is concerned about her water bill. She asked if the city goes with the new Cleveland Water Department proposal, will there be any control over how much Bay residents are billed for their water. Mrs. Barnett stated her bill was $55.00 and there is only herself in the household. The bill went up from $25.00, and the consumption of water was barely over what was paid in November. Mrs. Barnett noted that the new meter was installed and she feels that the higher bill may be to pay for the new equipment.
The Mayor responded that there is not much control over the billing right now. If help is needed, Mayor Sutherland’s assistant, Sue Kohl, will intercede on Mrs. Barnett’s behalf with the Cleveland Water Department to make sure it is accurate.
Nancy Brown reminded Council, the administration, and members of the audience that on Tuesday, March 5, at 7:30 p.m. at the Dwyer Memorial Senior Center, the first of three forums sponsored by the League of Women Voters will be held regarding regionalism.
Ms. Brown stated that she had an opportunity to work with Mrs. Jackson from the Cleveland Water Department and she is of wonderful assistance.
COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE
Annual Appropriation Ordinance
Mayor Sutherland gave a Power Point presentation on the financial situation, concentrating on the General Fund of the city, noting that the budget process this year was unduly challenging. There was a change over in personnel with the resignation of former Finance Director Steven Presley, and the appointment of the new Finance Director, Renee Mahoney.
Mayor Sutherland noted that revenues are impacted by the economy and the fact that the State of Ohio has been particularly challenging, and continues to be. There have been severe cutbacks in the Local Government Fund, the Personal Property Tax has been lost, and the Estate Tax is going away. Bay Village was extremely fortunate with the recent property tax appraisal in that the city ended up with only a 2% reduction, whereas some communities ended up with a 25 and 30% reduction in their values.
General Fund Administration is about $1.6 million of the budget, or 15% of expenditures, Police is $2.62 million, or 25%, Fire, not including the Emergency Paramedic Unit, is $1.5 million, or 14%, Service is about $3.6 million, or 33%, Building is about $400,000, or 3%, Community Services is $212,000, which is 2% of General Fund expenditures. There is $844,000 in transfers so the total expenditures for 2013 are about $10,982,000.
When first looking at the budget it was thought there would be a $1.2 million deficit. By moving things around and trimming things down, the deficit is now down to $482,857. There are still things to be moved around. Another firefighter will be moved from General Fund to the Emergency Paramedic Unit Fund, freeing up about $100,000 in the General Fund. The Mayor stated that they will continue to look for ways where they can trim, but in order to reduce expenditures at this point they are down to eliminating programs, reducing personnel costs which would be benefits, work force reduction, and outsourcing. Revenues can be increased through reducing income tax credit, increasing user fees such as the trash fee. The full paramedic levy can be collected, and the percentage allowed to be taken from cable bills could be taken. At this time the city is taking 3% but is allowed by the state to take up to 5%. The Mayor will be looking to Council to come together and look at a combination of reductions and revenue increases in order to bridge the gap.
Mr. Clark stated that the city is also going into labor negotiations at this time. This does not factor any wage increase. If a wage increase happens, the gap does get larger.
Mayor Sutherland stated that a budget is a working document. It will have to be massaged through the year, due to the fact that the city is in negotiations and is unsure when that will be completed. Things will come up, as last year, when Superstorm Sandy occurred and there were costs associated with that event.
The Mayor stated that this gap is not insurmountable. The gap of $800,000 year was faced last year, as well as $600,000 the year before, and $400,000 to $500,000 the year before that.
Mr. Young stated that at this point in time there is a proposal for first reading of the Annual Appropriation Ordinance. The committee did look at some of the capital components this evening, and some of the proposed capital expenditures were just received this evening. There are a number of changes that Mr. Young would consider making, and he would rather do that in the Finance Committee meeting scheduled for Friday, March 8 at 7:00 a.m. Before discussing revenues, the committee would like to look at cost savings that would not hurt the safety of the city.
Mr. Clark noted that the challenge is with no General Reserve Fund. There was approximately $1.3 million in the General Reserve Fund, three years ago. The budget must be balanced by the end of March.
Mr. Young noted that the city is looking at a reduction in Estate Tax. About $400,000 is budgeted in revenue for this year, which is basically leftover from last year. That will not come in next year, which adds to the problems going forward.
Mr. Koomar suggested a walk-through of the budget, fund by fund, for a high level discussion and to respond to any questions from Council.
The following comments were made:
Transfers came from the Accrued Benefits Fund in the amount of $30,000, and from the General Bond Retirement Fund in the amount of $30,000, to balance the General Fund in 2012.
Ambulance Fees – Revenue for the past two years has been an average of $270,000. The 2013 Budget is set at $300,000 is due to a change in fees. The current rate was not in place for the full year in 2012.
Licenses and Permits – $262,000 is budget for 2013. Revenue for 2012 was $237,000. The Finance Committee felt comfortable with the higher budget number for 2013 after looking back historically at previous years.
Municipal Income Tax – The General Fund, Accrued Benefits Fund, and Equipment Replacement Fund is funded from the Municipal Income Tax Fund. At the end of 2012, a change in the allocations to those funds for the 2012 year reverts back to the allocation percentages previous to 2012. By Councilmanic action, the breakdown of the allocations will have to be addressed. Mr. Young noted that the Accrued Benefits Fund receipts show income of $102,000 and $122,000 for the Equipment Replacement Fund. The two funds should show the same amount, and the discrepancy will have to be addressed. The allocations in 2012 were 96% General Fund, 2% to the Accrued Benefits Fund, and 2% to the Equipment Replacement Fund, as opposed to 94% General Fund, 4% Equipment Replacement Fund, and 2% Accrued Benefits Fund. Legislation must be prepared to return to the 2012 adjusted allocations. The legislation cannot be retroactive. Mr. Young would like to discuss the Equipment Replacement Fund further before placing the legislation on the next Council agenda. He noted the low interest rate currently and the fact that there is not a negative aspect to paying off debt for equipment replacement over time with the low interest environment.
Expenditures- Mr. Clark noted that it appears that the cost of the Fire Department has gone down. The reason for the reduction is that property tax millage has been reallocated to the Emergency Paramedic Unit Fund. The total of the two funds is $2.5 million.
Mr. Young noted that the differences are not large for personnel between 2012 and 2013 because there were not large salary increases.
Clerk of Council – Salary figure should be adjusted due to the 1.75% increase. Personal Services includes wages and benefits. The Clerk does not receive hospitalization benefits.
Transfers to Parks and Recreation from the General Fund – The amount of $305,000 in 2012 increased to $387,000 in 2013. The Service Department, Parks and Recreation employees’ hospitalization and benefits were being charged to General Fund. It was moved to Parks and Recreation to present a more realistic showing of how much it costs to run the Parks and Recreation Department.
Transfer to EPU Fund from the General Fund – No longer necessary due to the reallocations of property tax funds. An additional fireman will be transferred to the EPU Fund reducing the deficit in the General Fund by $100,000.
Fire Pension Fund – Mr. Young added the Fire Department full time and overtime, and Paramedic full time and overtime, and multiplied it by 24% which is the Fire Pension payment. It calculates to $426,168. Mrs. Mahoney stated that the pension must now be paid monthly so there will be 13 months of payments in 2013, accounting for the last quarterly payment of 2012. An additional $56,000 will be paid each year for the next three years.
Equipment Replacement Account No. 240 – Mr. Koomar stated that the opening balance is $960,000. The exchange of Revenue and Expenses throughout the year ends the year with a balance of $57,000. Mrs. Mahoney stated that any revenue from bonding out in 2013 is not shown in the account at this point. Mr. Young stated that the purchase order has not been placed yet for the Fire Truck for $535,000. Chief Lyons stated that the purchase order was placed last year. Mrs. Mahoney stated that the expense falls in 2013. Mr. Clark noted that the expense was approved at the end of October in 2012, because a price increase was scheduled for November 1. Mr. Clark thought the amount was factored into the debt schedule for 2012. Mr. Clark stated that the debt schedule for 2012 indicates debt incurred in the amount of $1,080,000. This large amount had to include the fire truck.
Account No. 282 – Accrued Benefits Fund – The beginning balance is $140,000, and end of year balance for 2013 is $3,800. Mr. Young stated that this is just a projected expense. Two meetings ago it was discussed adjusting it by $75,000 or $80,000. Mrs. Mahoney stated that one fireman, and possibly one policeman is retiring. Mr. Young stated that he would prefer to take debt out for the Equipment Replacement, rather than changing the Accrued Benefits allocation. We want to have enough funds in the Accrued Benefits Fund. We don’t want to have too many people retire and have to come back to Council to replace funds taken out. Mr. Clark added that we would have to figure out what the economics of the Accrued Benefits Fund pay-out would be and what the salary savings would be if that person wasn’t replaced.
Account No. 350 – Special Assessments. Mr. Ebert has completed the court transaction to clear out the fund. The General Fund will receive the residual funds.
Chief Lyons asked Mr. Koomar if the Council at this point is not replacing the firefighter retiring this year. Mr. Clark stated that he does not think any determinations have been made. He is just trying to work out the economics in terms of the budget. Chief Lyons commented that he is going through the candidate interview process and wanted to know if he is spinning his wheels or if he should proceed. Mr. Koomar stated that this is just the first cut of the Committee of the Whole to go through, see where we end up, and have a higher level discussion of where we are. Mr. Clark noted that you can’t really budget for Accrued Benefits unless you have known retirements.
Account No. 493 – Bradley Road Improvement – Mr. Galli stated that they are in the process of closing out the project right now. It is funded by a $ 1.25 million grant, with whatever portion remaining funded by a $1.25 million zero interest loan. At this point, only about half of the loan amount will be used. Mr. Koomar stated that there is money in the account, approximately $1 million. Mr. Clark stated that there was a large advance from the Infrastructure Improvement Fund. There are still amounts to be paid out. Mrs. Mahoney asked Mr. Galli to let her know how much there is left to be paid out. Mr. Clark stated that the final number came in below what was originally estimated.
Waldeck Estate Fund – Mr. Young stated that there was discussion earlier with Mrs. Fink who noted that there should be revenue from interest posted.
Health Insurance Fund – Mrs. Mahoney stated the Health Insurance Fund reflects the new insurance rates. Mr. Clark commented that the Health Insurance Fund budget for expenditures includes the potential for claims, includes the stop loss insurance premium and the administrative charges by Medical Mutual. Mr. Tadych and Mr. Clark noted that the stop loss insurance was adjusted per specific occurrence to save money on premiums.
Account No. 580 – Sewer Fund- Mr. Young commented that the sewer rental fee charged to residents basically pays for the service of the sewers and the finances necessary for the Bay Village share of the Rocky River Waste Water Treatment Plant expenses. There are no funds coming in for the capital improvements for sewers. As a city, we cannot afford the costs for projects that are EPA mandated without looking at trying to recoup some of those costs through an additional fee. Mr. Young suggested bonding for these projects over a 25 year period and the actual payment of the improvement be covered by the residents through an additional sewer fund payment.
Mr. Clark stated that the city has applied for grants. Those have not been received but we have $3.5 million worth of sewer projects we know must be done. One was the aerial sewer in Cahoon, one is the Cahoon Sewer for the Lark area that needs to be done, and one is the pump station work that needs to be done. Before anything is done to assess a capital sewer charge, the costs over a long term will be looked at very closely, what is received in public funding and how best to equitably split that to make sure no one is too disadvantaged. Rocky River charges $25.00 per quarter for a capital sewer charge.
Estate Tax – The revenue line item is indicated at $400,000 for the 2013 budget. That will be phased out next year, with the possibility of some residual payments. Mr. Koomar noted that due to this phasing out the 2014 Budget may have an $800,000 deficit.
Property Taxes – Mr. Young noted these will stay constant for the next three years at their present rate. Mr. Clark commented that if the State initiates House Bill No. 5, municipal income tax, that will also have an impact.
Property Tax Roll Backs – Mrs. Mahoney explained that property tax roll backs come from the State of Ohio.
Cable Television Fees – At this time the revenue is projected for 2013 at $167,000. Last year the revenue was $155,000 at 3% of franchise fees. If the franchise fee was increased to 5%, the maximum allowed by the state, it would garner an additional $100,000 in revenue. Mayor Sutherland stated that in order to increase the percentage, Council would merely pass an ordinance and then let the cable company know the percentage for the city has been increased. Mr. Tadych noted that each percent represents about $50,000.
Community Gym Equipment Replacement Fund- Account No. 231 – Mr. Koomar informed Mrs. Mahoney of the agreement with the School Board that requires a deposit in the fund each year to be set aside for needed repairs.
Parking Fines – Mrs. Lieske commented that fees were increased last year, but revenue is budgeted at less. Mr. Young stated that he would surmise the revenue would probably be more. It was budgeted from a conservative point of view.
Newsletter Advertising – The revenue for newsletter advertising should be posted to the Community Services Fund.
Street Construction – Mr. Koomar asked if there will be a component of potential debt in the account for the annual repaving. Mrs. Mahoney has a placeholder in the account. Mr. Clark stated that between the overlay program and the annual enhancements, the expense is expected to be over $1 million this year. Part of that has been financed with bond debt in the past. The other part we’ve done as a transfer out of the General Fund. Mr. Young stated that Mr. Miller, as Chairman of the Public Improvements Committee, will study this as well. There is a list of streets for him to review.
Police Pension Fund/Fire Pension Fund – Mr. Young noted that postings will be double checked. The change in property tax allocations and resultant shifting of personnel is reflected in these funds. To properly fund Fire Pension, Mrs. Mahoney stated that an additional $102,000 was needed. Mrs. Mahoney will send the Finance Committee the detail on this additional amount.
General Bond Retirement – This will be a work in progress.
Refuse Collection – Mr. Lee asked if there is enough protection in the Fuel Recovery for the increases in fuel prices. Mr. Young stated that there was an increase in the last contract for the point where the fuel recovery becomes active. It is felt that the $25,000 in the account will cover the need for fuel recovery fees.
Mrs. Lieske asked about Green Team revenue. It was explained that these were grant funds.
Police Department Part Time Wages are dropping down to $88,600 in 2013 from $115,000 in 2012. The same amount of overtime is budgeted for 2013. Mr. Young stated that overtime wages are paid at one-and-half times the rate. It would be preferable to see a substantive drop in overtime than in part time. The Police Chief will be asked for information. The increase in hospitalization is due to the fact that there were fewer officers.
Fire Department Wages – Mr. Young stated that historically there has been a large bump in overtime wages at year end. The Fire Chief stated that it has been high due to understaffing. Discussion will have to include the fact that with another retirement the overtime wages would be higher before a decision is made about filling the position. Mayor Sutherland stated that she did give the Chief permission to begin the process of interviewing candidates. The Mayor noted that three shifts of eight officers per shift will keep overtime wages down. Mr. Young stated that the time it takes to hire an officer is problematic and it might be advisable to look into changing the process of doing background checks for police and fire candidates.
Mr. Koomar asked for a spreadsheet of the wages for the Fire Department and the Emergency Paramedic Unit for review, including pension and health care. This will be provided for both the Finance Committee and the Council of the Whole.
Fire Department Training is showing an increase from $4,700 in 2012 to $7,500 in 2013.
Telephone Expense – Mr. Young questioned the total telephone expense in all accounts of $64,000. He asked to receive information concerning the breakdown between cell phones and land lines. More detail will be provided. There are no pay phones in any of the city buildings.
Mr. Miller asked if there is any anticipated savings if the city goes to a new phone system. The Warwick Communications representative stated that there will be no savings in the new system.
Mr. Clark asked if the Nixle upgrade will be included in the budget. Mrs. Mahoney stated that she did put it in with the Fire Department, Account No. 240. Mayor Sutherland stated that an ordinance will not be necessary for the contract for Nixle since the amount is less than $15,000. Mr. Clark stated that he would prefer some formal action, such as a motion to proceed, to document the action.
DARE Account No. 295 – Ms. Popovich has informed Mrs. Mahoney that the remainder of the grant was returned last year. The amount showing in the budget is assumed to be residual.
Mr. Young stated that the fund should be closed out and the $22,000 posting credited to the General Fund. An expense to close out the account will need to be appropriated.
Outside Legal Expense – Mr. Clark stated that the thought was that there was duplication in budgeting expenses related to the refunding of the Police Station Bond Issue done last year. Mrs. Mahoney stated that the amount shown is for self-issued debt, and the amount of $10,000 is shown for safe harbor.
Mr. Koomar asked if $320,000 is part of the reimbursement for the Service Department Salt Garage. Mr. Galli stated that a plan must be submitted for spending the funds in order to receive the funds. Mayor Sutherland stated that the city does not necessarily have to use the building in the same way as before, but the building must be rebuilt.
Mr. Miller asked for an explanation of Accounts No. 820 – Cahoon Memorial Park, and Account No. 830 – Cahoon Library. He asked if this is the cost for managing the trust. Mrs. Mahoney stated that the amounts needed in the funds are transferred from the General Fund to cover various expenses. Mrs. Mahoney stated that if the money is not spent or needed, the transfers do not need to be made.
Bradley Road – Account No. 493 – The $1,125,000 was transferred in from the Infrastructure Improvement Fund with the revised appropriation. When the loan money is received, the amount will be transferred back to the Infrastructure Improvement Fund. Mr. Galli has a final change order for the project ready for approval.
Infrastructure Improvement – Account No. 494 – The $1,050,000 was transferred in for the Cahoon Road Aerial Sewer improvement. This amount will be transferred back to the Infrastructure Improvement Fund after completion of the project and process of the loan by the state. Mr. Galli advised that the first payment of the loan will begin 6 months after completion. The first payment will be due December of 2013, and must be factored into the debt schedule. Mrs. Mahoney stated that payments are set for a period of thirty years.
2013 Proposed Capital Improvements
A report of 2013 Proposed Capital Improvements was distributed to Council.
Mr. Young noted that sewer improvements are an EPA mandate and must take priority over work on the Community House and other municipal buildings. Putting the sewer improvements into the debt schedule will free up funds to begin prioritizing work on municipal buildings. Mr. Young stated the question remains as to how to prioritize the repairs in order of preference.
Mr. Koomar stated that the reports have just been received this evening. Going through and understanding the scope of some of these projects is important.
Mr. Young noted the importance of keeping up the Community House. He stated that a lot of work is needed which is not itemized on the report, as well as an estimated cost.
Mayor Sutherland stated that there are two items on the list to be done at the Service Garage that are mandated by the EPA and must be completed by 2014.
Mrs. Lieske asked if there is anything planned for fixing the clock outside city hall. Mayor Sutherland stated that the clock was disconnected after the storm. It is still leaking in the clock tower and the clock may not be operational until the area is dried and all the repair work is finished.
Mr. Young stated that there may be additional items to add to the 2013 Proposed Capital Improvements list.
Mrs. Lieske asked if there has been any review of the steps by the cabin in Cahoon Memorial Park that lead up to Lake Road. Mr. Galli stated that as soon as the weather permits the steps will be inspected to see what can be done in-house.
Mr. Koomar asked Mrs. Mahoney what she is comfortable with for debt issuance at this point. Mrs. Mahoney stated that the debt limit has been reached for 2013. There is room for about $400,000 for 2014. Mr. Young stated that sewer improvements will affect the amount of money that can be bonded out. Mr. Clark noted that there are five bond issues being paid at the end of 2013: a 2003 (2), 2006, 2007 and 2008, amounting to about $575,000.
The General Bond Retirement tax millage for 2013 was not changed.
Mr. Koomar asked if the debt schedule he received from Mrs. Mahoney recently is reflected in the 2013 budget. Mrs. Mahoney stated that $1.9 million is included in the budget, but there is nothing in place for debt for the 2013 budget. The improvements and equipment replacement for 2013 need to be analyzed further.
ENVIRONMENT, SAFETY AND COMMUNITY SERVICES COMMITTEE
American Fireworks Company Contract
Mr. Clark stated that the ordinance will be presented this evening for the contract for the 2013 Fourth of July fireworks. Half of the $11,000 contract price must be paid by April 1, 2013.
Donations were received last year through the Village Foundation, covering two years of fireworks. The city will pay the contract and seek reimbursement through the Village Foundation. Mr. Tadych stated that it would be nice if someone would step forward to donate the 2014 Fireworks. Mr. Lee suggested an amendment by reading to the ordinance referencing the fact that the cost of the contract is subject to reimbursement by the funds received through the Village Foundation.
SAFEbuilt Agreement
This agreement involves a reconfiguration of the Building Department services, overseeing plan reviews, inspection services, code enforcement, contractor registration and licensing. Mr. Clark called upon Mayor Sutherland for comments.
Mayor Sutherland stated this is a company that they would like to contract with to provide the services as described. Should the city go down this road they will be able to save $254,000 in 2013, in a combination of direct savings, revenue that is retained, and cost avoidance. Annualized, it would be a savings of about $435,910. Besides offering these services, they will be expanding the hours of operation of the Building Department to 40 hours per week. There will be inspections on Fridays. It should be a very seamless transition.
Mr. Koomar asked if SAFEbuilt will, under this proposal be taking over the services of some of the city personnel. Mayor Sutherland stated that this is correct. Law Director Ebert is preparing a contract incorporating the items that the Mayor has discussed and recommendations by Council, all of which were gone over with the SAFEbuilt representatives when meeting with them last week. The contract has a 90-day out clause so the three year agreement can be terminated by either party with 90 days notice. Commencement date is May 1, 2013. Mayor Sutherland stated that the SAFEbuilt representatives will speak with the city employees this week.
Mr. Lee asked if SAFEbuilt has done this successfully in other communities. Mayor Sutherland stated that this company has 140 clients across the country and has successfully provided a range of services from full operations to just some portions of services to some communities. Mayor Sutherland visited one of their communities in Michigan to see how the operation performed, and talked with the City Manager. References provided are very favorable. Contractors and residents like their services. They will interview all of the city employees, and have a 90% retention rate of hiring folks out of existing building departments. Mayor Sutherland looks forward to a good partnership with SAFEbuilt. Mr. Ebert stated that SAFEbuilt will collect 85% of the permit fees; the city will retain 15% of the permit fees. SAFEbuilt will incur the cost of the employees, bring in their own technology, and their own vehicles. They actually have a much better computer software system; the one that we work with now is a cumbersome system. They attend all meetings and go to court when necessary. Their office will be in the former police station. A lease arrangement is to be worked out. There are some improvements that need to be done in the former police station that need to be addressed. They have volunteered to split the cost. Mr. Galli will work with Mr. Sears to provide the actual costs of those improvements.
Mr. Clark asked if the ordinance to be submitted at the special meeting this evening for first reading should be held until the final issues are worked through. Mayor Sutherland stated that she would not advise that. Mr. Koomar suggested putting the ordinance on first reading this evening. Mayor Sutherland stated that she would not advise that. Mayor Sutherland stated that there is no reason to hold up. Mr. Lee asked if the ordinance is placed on first reading this evening, is the time line discussed by the Mayor still feasible. The Mayor stated it is not feasible. That creates difficulties for informing employees. It is unknown if the representatives will come in to the city this week if the ordinance hasn’t been passed, knowing that we are still tweaking a couple of things.
Mr. Young stated that he would ask that this be discussed further in the Executive Session this evening.
Mr. Galli stated that the proposal has been well investigated and thought out.
Nancy Brown asked if Building Inspectors will be on the road looking at housing and structures that need to be addressed. Mayor Sutherland stated that eventually, that is the plan. Mrs. Brown stated that there are many eyesores in the city. The Mayor said that the city used to have the walk-around inspection program, but because of budget cuts it was suspended. It is the city’s intention to reinvigorate that program. Next summer will be targeted.
Mr. Koomar stated that he believe that walk-around inspections is a proactive way of maintaining the housing stock, helping property values and residents with re-sales. The needed improvements do affect the over-all appeal of the city when they are completed.

SERVICES, UTILITIES & EQUIPMENT COMMITTEE
Donation of scrap light poles to Robertson Association
Mr. Tadych stated that these seven poles have been stored behind the building of the Service Center and are no longer of use to the city. They will be donated to a non-profit company. Mr. Galli stated that as part of the good-housekeeping requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency, they have cleaned out the barns and hope to have a public sale of items.

I just saw this picture and post on Colleterie and through how perfect that hanging rail - from Ikea - would be in our study...We have big plans for the study, but I'm hoping Dave wont be against me getting something like this. I know they are fairly in-expensive...so, I'll have to ask him later and see what he says!!
The good news is that after this week in work I have a full 2 weeks off! To tidy and clean and decorate! I'm hoping to paint our bedrroom, put the curtain rail up, possibly sand some more of the stairs and generally have a good clean and tidy!
Ada and I are also going to see my dad for a few days so I'll get to relax! Yay!

We look forward to seeing you both !
That hanging rail organizer is sucha great idea! I am a big IKEA fanatic! Hope to see your the results of your organizing! -Jessica L

We stayed here for 2 weeks in August. We had a very present stay in a beautiful complex. The drive to Disney is approx 20 mins on a very straight forward route. The villa was very well equipped and extremely clean on arrival. The children loved he pool and wanted to get back to it everyday! The kettle wasn't working on arrival and I called the management company who came and changed it straight away! Fantastic stay- would definitely reccomend this beautiful villa.
We had a wonderful three week stay at Villa Barbados and can’t wait to go back again, hopefully next year. The Villa is absolutely beautiful, spacious and light and immaculately kept and furnished. We arrived in the evening to a lamp lit welcome. The Pool and Jacuzzi, which called to us after a long flight, were delightful and well used during our stay. The Villa Management arrived the next morning to check everything was fine for us. Everything we needed for our comfort was present, from the well stocked kitchen supplies, useful facilities such as the large fridge/freezer, good laundry area, to a huge TV and great sound system. The Villa comes with the ever essential Wifi, which kept us happy when relaxing with our iPads. The bedrooms are well furnished and comfortable and there are spacious cupboards in every room for your belongings. We were very happy there.

i. it creates a sense of mutual responsibility
ii. it helps students be clear about what success looks like in the lesson
iii. students know where they are heading
iv. keeps the teacher on track
If students are going to write an email, then they need to know what is the criteria that would tell them they are successful in writing an email. I would break up the objectives into the various skills in writing that email. For example:
Learning Objective: To write an e-mail to a friend, giving advice.
Success Criteria: You will know you are successful if you can:
i. use an appropriate format
ii. begin and end the letter appropriately
ii. write an elaboration for each point given
ii. use sequence connectors to join your paragraphs
I encourage my teachers to put up labels of the Lo and Sc in class so that it is clear for all to see. Some prefer to write on rolled whiteboards and hang it in the class.
When do I share the LO and SC? Obviously, this needs to happen in the beginning of the class, whether it is after Set Induction or before.
According to Robert Gagne, we should share the learning objective right after the set induction.Script Error Messages Windows 7

Remember my ruminations on cliches in webcomics? Well, seriously cool musician E. A. Rowe commented that Goats -- the very webcomic that I was referring to, because of their artistic use of ninjas, themselves made fun of the phenomenon earlier, with the announcement of the Robot Monkey Pirate tee shirt. It was used in a strip as an example of the ridiculous crap that webcomics could get their fans to buy. Needless to say, they then started selling the shirts. And God help me, I want one.

Although I agree about the crucial role that cleavage plays in webcomics, I have to object to your repeated desire to see monkeys, robots, pirates, ninjas, and/or zombies with cleavage. That is just nasty.
Especially zombies. Ninjas are okay.
Comment from: Eric Burns posted at October 22, 2004 1:23 PM
First off... I have already attested, loudly, that Monkey/Cleavage convergence has been covered. Period. I beg all of you.
As has Robot Cleavage, Pirate Cleavage, Ninja Cleavage and Monkey Cleavage.
As for Zombie Cleavage... perhaps we could establish that the one sure way to defeat zombies is the presentation of appropriate cleavage. This, to me, would save all of us stabbing our eyes out with sporks.

If the deal was for under 40m and Bale had a pay per play style contract, or at least a decent proportion of his wage dependent on him being fit to play then maybe. But to be honest I would prefer it if we focused on players who are fit and able at least 90% of the time.

Looks like you and I are going to retire together, meet you at Schooner's!
I bet you had a great time there, Jennifer.
"Go Jen, go go go Jen!" (sorry, first thing that popped into my head for the dancing picture) It looks like you had a well deserved, fabulous time!
"KUTCHIE PELAEZ" DOESN'T LIVE IN KEY WEST ANYMORE, AND NEITHER DOES JIMMY BUFFETT. BUT MICHEAL MCCLOUD STILL LIVES IN KEY WEST.
YEA, GO MICHEAL, TOBY CAN JUST KISS YOUR ASS..

Here’s a look at how adding a social aspect to your Web application can be good for how it evolves.
Most of us spend a major chunk of our day on Facebook. The platform has introduced some major changes about the way we interact with applications, and the way we interact with each other. The new timeline feature has opened up a wide variety of ways in which we can create innovative applications, and this is exactly what we are going to look at in this article.
The new open graph platform has allowed a user to do more than just like or share something. We can now read articles, listen to music and perform almost any action that the app developer has defined. This is basically achieved using a subject-predicate-object or user-action-object architecture, where you define a set of actions that a user can perform, and a set of objects that the user can interact with. These actions can be reflected in a number of ways, like the timeline view, application view, newsfeed, ticker, etc.
At the core of any new Facebook application is the open graph protocol. This protocol intersects with the various Semantic Web technologies, which enable us to represent any Web page or piece of information as an object. Of course, these objects have some properties that Facebook users interact with, and this exposes the Facebook platform to the whole Web. Basically, any application that speaks the open graph protocol can speak to the Facebook platform.
Integrating your Web app with the timeline
In case you’re wondering why and how Facebook can be integrated into your Web app, here’s the answer. Basically, the new platform allows Facebook to integrate inseparably, with the help of various plugins like the Login button, Like button, and even the open graph. These enable ease of development, and simplicity in managing the users of your Web app. They will also help you increase the use of the application, with the help of free social media publicity, which is based on referrals being made from person-to-person.
Remember, you are much more likely to use an app if your friends use it too. Some of the important technologies and tools that you’ll be using are the Facebook SDK and the Graph API. This is something that we won’t be covering in this article; you’ll have to look it up in the relevant documentation. Our motive here is to just highlight how the new platform has brought about changes that can be reflected in your application — and not to teach Facebook app development itself.
Getting started
To get started developing applications on Facebook, you need the developer app. Next, click the Create New App button, and enter the name of your application and the app namespace (Figure 1).
The app namespace is something that is used for the open graph, under which all your open graph objects and actions reside. This is why it is something that should be unique for your application. When you’ve done this, after the security check, you will be led to the basic settings page (Figure 2), where you can configure more details regarding your application.
Here you can choose your application domain, and the way in which your app integrates with Facebook. It can either be a website that adds a social layer over it, or an application that resides wholly under the Facebook interface. Either way, you will have to enter the appropriate settings related to your application here.
Apart from this, you can set up an authentication system for your application from the Auth Dialog tab (Figure 3), where you can set the headline, description and an explanation for the permissions you ask from the user.
A new feature is “authenticated referrals”, where you can set up mandatory and optional permissions for the user, and the Auth Dialog will automatically appear when a user is referred to your app. This will allow a user to be automatically logged in to your app. You can see this in the demo screenshot (Figures 4 and 5), where I have asked for the publish_actions and publish_stream permissions as mandatory and optional, respectively.
Objects, actions and aggregations
To make the user of your application interact with the open graph, you can set up objects and actions for your application that allow a user to read an article on the this website, for example. Setting this up is pretty easy. Basically, you need to go to the Open Graph tab, and in the “Getting started” section, type what a user can do — for instance, in my app, users can read an article. This will then automatically create an action and an object, and you just have to edit and save the settings (Figures 6 and 7).
The object that we defined here is basically the object type, i.e., a classification of different objects available in the application. The objects can individually be defined in your app with the help of a markup such as the following:
<head prefix="og: fb: article:"> <meta property="fb:app_id" content="25xxxxxxxxxxx11" /> <meta property="og:type" content="article" /> <meta property="og:url" content="Put Your Own URL Here" /> <meta property="og:title" content="Some Arbitrary String" /> <meta property="og:description" content="Some Arbitrary String" /> <meta property="og:image" content="" />
If you use a built-in object already present in the Facebook platform, it will automatically populate it with properties, and define aggregations that are possible for that particular object. An aggregation (Figure 8) is a new way to collectively publish the actions taken by a user in the past, like the articles read, top authors, etc.
The dashboard section allows you to add sample data, and preview some aggregations for your application. It also provides sample code for you to describe an object in the open graph on your Web page, and a sample curl command for you to retrieve, create and delete actions. Overall, aggregations are a very powerful feature that you must use in order to generate innovative time-line views for your application.
While creating new actions, you have to enter the connected objects that have been defined, the action properties, the present and past tense of the action, and the layout style of the attached data. It is important to note that you need to get the actions approved before they can be used in production.
Past actions and activity log
“Past actions” can be used in the timeline to post an action taken by a user more than three days ago. Such actions do not generate a news feed, and rather, are just tagged at that point in time, and can be visible in the activity log. These “past actions” can thus be used by setting the start time for the action as more than three days ago.
Defining roles and accessing insights
As the app administrator, you can define a role for each of the members involved in the development process of your application, whether it is the developers, testers or statistical analysts who need to retrieve data related to insights. Each of these has varied access to the application, in a differing manner. While developers can also change the settings related to the application, the tester can only access and use an application in the sand-boxed mode. You can even set up a test user account that can be used for testing purposes, from this section.
Apart from this, the new insights data tracking provides impressive visualisation tools for easy data tracking of new installs, sharing, performance, open graph activity, permission patterns, etc. This is something that is very valuable for future development and feedback, as to what the users want from your application, and what the social trends really are.
In conclusion, Facebook is a platform that has grown exponentially, and has become a hub of social Web development. There is probably no other platform that can provide such flexibility and such a wide array of tools to enable developers to build such new and innovative applications.

MATRIMONY AND GYMMIE
This article, written by Mr. Anil Handa'75 appeared in SAM twenty years back. Hope it makes for some interesting reading.)
What should be the perspective of a prospective bridegroom? The answer (if you can call it that! ) to this question has been keenly discussed at great lengths by many a Gymmie boy. The venue of these discussions ranges from the dining hall to the squash court. Usually however the arguments centre on the prospective Gymmie. There are a couple of sober looking (?) Gymmies (who have nothing else to do) who paint a very rosy picture about the matrimonial prospects of a young Sam. Their hallucinations wander around a suave and debonair Sam and a Cleopatra playing hide and seek in the Garden of Eden. However, all the hopes and aspirations of these buddies got completely shattered and they heard the frank opinion of a Simi at the recent club day. She said, " leave apart this big talk, all I can say is that the men in the administrative services and in the private sector have better matrimonial prospects." These guys argued with her for more than an hour, but the lady was adamant.
Coming to the crux of the problem, these guys, the matrimonial fanatics, want to know how they can their image so that they can outsmart others in this competitive field. These guys have queries like whether girls prefer men who play tennis better than squash or who can wield the willow better than a hockey stick. The 'matrimonial group' (if I may call them that) have reached one firm conclusion - that girls like men (especially Sams) with moustaches (source of information is a top secret). No wonder, one can see the members of this clan sporting moustaches having peculiar contours on their pale baby like faces.
Another diversion for the members of the matrimonial group is their constant attack on the string of mess managers who come and go. They complain that the grub and especially the potatoes are ruining their matrimonial prospects! However, the obese ones continue to 'hog' everything that comes their way. Obesity, for them, is no longer a predicament but an asset. (After the entire average Indian woman is on the heavier side).
One of the most surprising characteristics of the 'matrimonial group' is their inherent introvert nature. Among themselves, they talk very big ( All censored stuff) but whenever they are confronted with strangers or guests (ladies included) they remain tongue-tied. Perhaps that is the reason why they are bent on improving their images by one means or the other !
The 'matrimonial group' has also valuable consultation services provided to them. Whenever a probationer or any other young Sam happens to drop in Gymkhana, these guys take full advantage of the situation. They keenly listen (and subsequently analyze!) to the various 'adventures' of the ever debonair, young Sam. They have also succeeded in coercing the Editor (I won't deny that he is gullible!) to publish matrimonial ads in the Sam Sunday Special (S3), the wallpaper which was produced weekly in Gymkhana.
Inspite of all consultation services and their sources of information, the 'matrimonial group' yet seeks for the solutions to many of their burning (0r impertinent?) questions Their last resort is the valuable advice of the Simis. I, therefore, earnestly request the Simis to save this clan from extinction. They are requested to write a sketchy article on "Why I selected a Sam as my husband ". I hope the Editor will offer attractive prizes for their efforts. So ladies, please do write to help some damsels (?) in distress!

I’m writing a review, looking at ‘dealing with plagiarism in the internet age‘. I’ve gathered my sources, read the majority of them and inwardly digested and cogitated. I needed a way to get my thoughts down quickly and organise them into a structure, so I used a good old fashioned pencil and paper and drew myself a mindmap. It just sort of happened that way. It occurred to me (having been playing with google wave and wondering what on earth it was for) that it would be great to have a way to organise my papers within this mindmap structure. So, I redrew the mindmap on mindmeister and started going through the papers I had, adding them into the relevant sections of the map. I added notes to each citation to remind me why I’d put it there and what evidence or opinions I wanted to draw from the paper into the review.
This exercise has highlighted places that I need to do some more research and some papers have influenced the structure and content of the mindmap, but it’s getting there and has really helped me to begin to synthesize my thoughts.
Now, what would be really cool is a google wave robot that would crawl my mindmap, pull the citations and link them straight to the Citeulike bookmarks I’ve been keeping for this project and then direct to the DOIs (I’d have like IGOR to come and suggest/ pull up my citations as I was adding them too!) then when I pulled off the outline plan from mindmeister, I’d have an almost rewritten review complete with citations and live links to the references. Readers of the review would then have a clickable resource and a link to the Citeulike bookmarks to share and use.On 13th October my partner and I took some time out to go for a walk. We decided to set out from Wintringham which is a short drive across the valley from us. Wintringham is a village at the foot of the wolds. It was a rainy, windy day but as the walk was mostly through woodland it kept us quite sheltered.
The walk progressed through the woods which were dominated by beech and quickly traversed up a steep hill. In fact so steep it was nearly vertical. I didn’t think I’d make it to the top and suprised myself when I did. Particularly, as having torn my achillies tendon a few months ago I thought I’d be in for trouble. What was even more of a suprise was that at the top of the hill there was a quirky gate and fence leading onto a land art feature which I had no idea even existed.
This feature sat on top of the hill overlooking the Vale of Pickering which was shrouded in cloud and awash with rain. The dominating feature of it being a large dew pond with a seat to contemplate the view…if only you could see it. On a clear day I imagine it would be quite picturesque.
This was a really nice find and made the steep ascent up the hill worth it. Not to mention the fact there were carved figures keeping guard and ancient earthworks too. We walked a little further through somemore woodland then decided to turn around to seek out some lunch trekking back down the steep hill to Wintringham.
We couldn’t resist looking at Wintringham church before we left which is no longer in use but owned by the churches conservation trust. It has features which date back to the medieval period with its beautiful carvings, wooden panels and floor tiles. It looks in need of some tlc and now it provides a home for bats.Most were rejected by the schools.
"For every state school that welcomed the books, several others said that they had not asked for them, had no use for or interest in them and no book storage and please would the publisher take them back forthwith." (From a letter in the TLS, Jan 20, 2006 - which I've just got round to reading)
"O my people, you have forgotten your past and in so doing, you have forgotten your destiny. You have lost Christ and so lost your memory and you no longer know who you are.This is why it is part of the essential Christian task of this time to preserve our memory, to witness to the choices made. We look for the city that is to come, and we mourn the passing of this city that has been.
When you chose Christ and His Holy Mother, your saints and martyrs were beyond number, the English land resembled the Milky Way, a galaxy of hundreds and thousands of lights of wisdom who went out and conquered hearts and souls in Europe. But your lights went out long ago."

The ‘party in the park’ organised by Newtownabbey Borough Council and Glengormley Traders Association, filled the community space all day long with plenty of community spirit which was kept alive with the myriad fun activities on offer. Classic car displays, circus performances, water zorbing, inflatables and live music had all ages entertained.
Visitors to the event were treated to chocolate eggs kindly provided by Tesco Northcott while also enjoying the opportunity to decorate a patchwork cow which will take up residence in Loughshore Park this summer as part of Northern Ireland’s CowParade.
Ed Burns, President of Glengormley Traders Association said: “This event is exactly what Glengormley needs - it was great to see the park being used by so many people. We are grateful for the funding received from Newtownabbey Borough Council’s Community Festival Fund and hope to build on this for next year.”
Lisa O’Kane, the council’s Tourism and Events Manager added: “We were delighted that the rain stayed away and that the crowds came out to support this annual event in Glengormley. Everyone had a great day and we have received excellent feedback so far.”The TrainingMy training for this marathon was pretty good until the last 3 weeks. For the first time I had a nighttime "Charlie Horse" on a Friday night, which scared me so much I aborted my last long run on that following Sunday.
I also picked up a cold and this basically took me out of training for 1 week.
After so many marathons, I'm used to such things happening sometimes: it's just part of of the game.
The challenge is to do your best race given everything that gets thrown your way.
Arrival and ExpoWe decided to stay in Old Town Alexandria, near the metro stop so I could just take it to the start. I won't bore you with the Expo which was across the Potomac River from Alexandria. MCM did have a lot of high quality swag for sale..and may people bought a ton of it, I bought a jacket and a hat. The checkout took a looong time there were so many folks buying.
Race day: Transport-Weather-Course
After checking the website more carefully I discovered that due to track work the Metro was not opening until 7am! (Start was at 7:55) There was no way to get to the start in time, or if there was it would be tight. (The Pentegon stop was the nearest to the start and it was a long 1+ mile walk from there to the start.)
Actually because of this they were keeping the start open up until 9am. The races are chip timed so you can start long after the crowds go out if you want. However, there are some downsides to that idea: you miss the excitement of running with the crowds, and more importantly, the water stops may run low on water. It has happened in many marathons and I didn't expect the Marines to screw this up, but I didn't want to find out.
I signed up for a 'book ahead' Lyft for 5:30am on race morning..but I was nervous about that as I have never used that feature and it would be a total drag if nobody showed up.
Luckily, the hotels in the area had complained to the city and so they hired some really nice busses to go from the Metro stops every 15 min starting at 5:15am. The hotel neglected to mention this when I checked in, but I found out about them when I chatted with another runner at breakfast two days prior to the start. Whew!
Note: If I every run the MCM again I would stay near the finish in Rosslyn. You could walk to the start and then walk home from the finish. Yes, that area isn't particularly touristic, but the Metro and Lyft/Uber/Taxi makes it easy to get to those places, including Old Town Alexandria
Race day the forecast was not great: 60F at the start and about 75F by the time I would finish. Mostly cloudy at the start but some full sun by my finish time. DARNIT. Oh well, this is always a risk with MCM...it's really on the boarderline of "The South" and so it can be warm.
For those of you that aren't runners, over 60F means you are slowing down big time. I think that number is really more like 50-55F..for me. The elites that run at 2:0X hour finish times (Kenyans mostly) slow down if it's over about 40F...they throw off a LOT of heat at the paces they run, even though they are pretty small (120-140lbs).
But, not a disaster thought like 90F would be..that gets into unsafe territory: I would have been DNS (did not start).
I checked an online website that had a calculator for the slowdown as a function of the humidity and temperature. I plugged in the forecast and 10 m/m and it said I needed to add 30s. Ok, so 10:30 pace it is! I knew I'd be slower than that because of crowding (no tangent ..aka 'course-line' running) possible) and hitting every water stop.
My goal is always the same: to have tiny negative split and also leave nothing on the table in the last third of the race. This was extra fun to do this year because of the Strava Back Half challenge to marathoners: if you could document a negative split in the marathon, you get a pair of free New Balance shoes!
I like contests / challenges that are about something other than running a new PR. Once you've been a runner for a bunch of years, learned how to train well and pace well and been lucky enough to have some perfect training cycles and then some fast-flat marathons on cool days sans headwinds, it's very very hard to get a new PR.
We need some other goals to shoot for: my plan was to look at the m/m pace average on my watch at 13.1 and then try to keep that number *smaller* for the 2nd half of the race. Didn't have to be much smaller: just a second less on the watch by the finish would mean a 26 second negative split...good enough!
The course is pretty interesting, weaving around DC with the highlight running down both sides of the National Mall and passing the Capitol on the turnaround.
The course is not flat as you can see here it has some hills at the front, and some rollers just when you're getting fried..particularly nasty (and hard to see here) is a gut wrenching steep hill right at the finish.
Race Morning
I got up early, as usual and puttered around getting everything ready. Since I have very little higher brain function on race mornings i used my pre-race checklist to make sure I didn't forget anything.
I took a larger disposable water bottle than usual so I could preload as much water starting about 1/2 hour from the start gun.
The hotel was offering some bananas and bagels etc but after many experiments I have found that breakfast, if taken, should be at least 3 hours before the start, and it is optional, assuming you've gotten some decent carb input in the last few days before the race. (not huge total calories, but a bigger carb/protein ration)
I have found that the ability to take as many GUs during the race is a good skill to have ...this keeps the blood glucose up and prevents bonking. I carry 9 GUs and try to have one before the start by about 15 minutes and then one every 3 miles until mile 24. When it's warm I've found sometimes the tummy can object to too much GU....this can be really bad.
I have never used a drop bag in all my races...too much of a pain at the finish to get the stuff back! I have disposable clothes if it's cold at the start and/or perhaps a very light shell jacket that I can roll up into a belt and tie around my waist. It was 60F so I just had a t-shirt.
As I wait for the sun to come up I spoke with a few people. This race has a lot of first time marathoners.
One guy I was sitting next to asked me about my calf sleeves..if they "hurt my legs". He was wearing them too, I noticed.
"Nope" I said, "they seem keep me from getting calf strains". He then shared with me the fact that it tried them on a run and they started made his legs hurt.
During his first marathon he had terrible problems with the muscles on the insides of his knees hurting and said he was reduced from an 8:40 m/m pace to a 14:00 pace after about 10 miles. He was also wearing some tape on his left calf...something about that muscle being sore after the long drive to DC.
Basically, he seemed a bit of a mess. I asked him "How was your training cycle?" he said good, except only one long run of 12 miles. (!) I said, "I think I see your problem here...there is NO WAY you can run a marathon at any fast pace on that kind of long run mileage. The best plan would be a walk-run strategy from the get-go." He didn't seem to want to hear that.
Some people just act and speak without getting the benefits of other people's learning, e.g. science and shared experiences. They have some kind of 'magical thinking' that they think makes them special. This kind of thinking is typical in small children but I guess a bit of it sticks in all of us to different extents.
Anyway, the dawn was really beautiful, with lot of red clouds. Two V22 Osprey's flew over in helicopter mode..looking like alien spacecraft.
The line up for the race got very crowded. I was finishing my water about 15min before the start and had my first gu. (plenty of portlets..used them twice in the hour before the start)
The start is indicated by firing a large howitzer (!) but we were so far back from the start it wasn't very loud at all. Took me 7 minutes I think to cross the starting line.
First Half
The first half went smoothly...I settled in at my 10:30-ish pace and the miles ticked by, the temps were not hot, but it was warm and humid and so lots of sweating. I hit every water stop and sometimes even took two cups if they were half full.
A lot of people in this race are running it in memory of marines KIA (killed in action). Usually they had a picture of the person on the back of their shirt with their name, and when they died. I saw many brothers, sisters and friends running like this.
This added a somber element to the race, there was plenty of chatter and high spirits but there was a constant reminder of all the young people that died fighting under the american flag in the last 10 years of fighting.
At one point were were running along a river and there was forest and some green boarder along the road. Many guys (incl me) took the opportunity to water the ivy. The gals had to wait until a portolet...and one place near a park there was a building with toilets as well.
One guy had his beagle with him on this stretch and he was so excited to see all the running (from his owners arms) that he was howling like mad. Many of us howled back at him which got him going even louder 8)
For a while I followed a bare shirted guy that was juggling. I have no idea how he did...he pulled away from me.
By about 8 miles the people around me settled down for a while and we gradually found our way along the water..at about mile 9 we entered the 'wear blue' mile. On this stretch, families of fallen soldiers (both men and women) had put up pictures of them with there names and dates of KIA.
These pictures lasted for a full mile, with one picture about every 5 feet. So about 1000 young people remembered.....nobody was talking. At the end of this mile, all the families were along the road cheering us on with gusto.
This left me in a pretty sad state.
About a half a mile later as I was passing a women with a picture on her back I noticed the name had a ', daughter' after it. This was a gold family parent of a KIA daughter running the race. That hit me pretty hard. As I passed her, I gently said hello and told her I was so very, very sorry for her loss. She replied, 'Thank you, thank you, so much'.
I don't think much of some of the decisions made by our leaders but it falls on ordinary people to bear the brunt of them.
I hit the half marathon split in 2:20:XX, showing a 10:32 average pace. I was passing more and more runners reduced to walking.
In big races with lots of first timers this is not surprising: there are lots of charity runners that aren't very well trained in the first place and they
don't always almost never pace themselves well. Or, you have the unlucky spasm or cramp due to not very well seasoned muscles acting up.
Onward to the Mall! This is where Toni was waiting for me. She could see me twice, once on the north edge of the mall headed east and then the south edge going back west toward the river and the finish. She took these pictures:
You can see that it was quite cloudy still (yay). I also wore a singlet rather than a full t-shirt and that helped keep me cooler.
I was feeling pretty good at mile 16. The sun was coming out more and more but I pressed along and got the average pace down to 10:28 at one point. My legs felts actually pretty tired on the outside, but there was a feeling of strength on the inside.
It's a subtle feeling that is important to track, by mile 18 I wondered if I was pressing just a bit too hard (I'm talking seconds per mile). The climb over the bridge at mile 19 left me feeling a bit spent but I was hanging in there..on the downhills I came back.
This continued....the downhills and music stations would let me recover and the uphills would be oh so hard. I was bouncing now between 10:29 and 10:30 on the average...ominous.
By mile 21 I was passing tons of walkers, one or two every second it seemed. This made me feel better about my state but could tell I was working harder and harder to keep the same pace.
As usual, time slowed down. The last minutes from mile 24 to the finish were extremely tough. I was entering the wall gradually and I ended up having to walk for 10-15 seconds a few times in this stretch...but always was able to resume.
The finish is placed in such a way that you can't see it until the last minute of the race, cruel really, and then you get to see a 50' hill..ouch! I had read about it but it was just crazy steep so I power walked it and then once on top sprinted to the finish
Results
Chip Time 4:41:50Place 7549 / 19917
Sex Place 4807 / 10640
Age Group Place 93 / 395
Not bad placing considering the slow time. Top quarter of my age group, top half of all men. My results were good because of the even pacing/not fading.
I clicked on lots of folks that finished around my time and most had faded by 10-20 minutes or more in the last 10 miles. Not fun.
Here's the list of splits, first half done in 2:20:35, even splits would give a finish of 4:41:10, I got a 4:41:50. Therefore I lost 40 seconds in the second half.
I had build up a decent negative split of about a minute but in the last 2 km I lost that back and 40 seconds more. No free shoes for me!
I'm not unhappy about that at all. It's a very very fine line we are talking about and if you don't know the hills during the last miles of the course really well you can't really pace yourself to that precision. And the increasing temps took their toll...a 40 second positive split suits me fine 8)
That's why races like CIM are so nice: no hills at all in the last miles and often nice and COLD on race day.
Nice splits from timing mats every 5k. Hard to cheat the course in this race (it does happen that people cut the course believe it or not, check out this website of a guy dedicated to tracking them down.).
I ran 26.74 miles on the garmin due to the crowding.
Post Finish
Oh my was I thirsty. Even after drinking at every stop (and by the way they had a lot of stops with tables on both sides of the street.) I was really feeling it. After getting the medal they handed us a bottle of energy drink and I drank it down competely in about 30 seconds.
I came upon a grassy area and just plunked down a while to rest. I ate a banana and just relaxed and pondered the race. There was a Marine that kept telling us to not rest there but get up and move on and everybody just totally ignored him, including me. I mean really? WTF is the problem?
Eventually I got tired of listening to his human-tape-loop, got my old bones up and kept walking. Took a long walk to get to the metro at Rosslyn, which was super crowded but they had very nice folks manning the station to show us all where to go. I had my Metro card so got to the track pretty quickly and road the 20 min back to my stop and walked about 12 min to the hotel.
(All that walking after the finish was a good thing..keeps you from stiffening up)
Sadly I never found any more fluids to be had after the finish. I asked here and there and people pointed ahead, but nothing turned up.
When I got back to our room, Toni had bought me some food and drink so I chowed down after a long shower...by then I was passing fluid ok and 'clearly' (cough) had not been overly dehydrated. (Unlike the Tacoma Marathon where it got hotter and I ran stupider ;)
The Swag
A nice medal and a nice, but very heavy shirt. I would never be able to run in this shirt but it might be good for and undergarment for skiing ;) The shirt is a large that is closer to a medium..I can just barely fit it.
I did see people on the course wearing this shirt in the race, BTW. Goofy!

Btw, to post a video, all you have to do is a copy and paste of the embed code. Once you copy it..paste it to your post and then publish it... voila! You have video. The embed codes are located on the right hand side of the video's on YouTube. If you want to center the video on the page, just do the html code this page and it will show you how to do html tags. You probably know how to do most of them already.
Does that make sense?
Enjoy the rest of your weekend, kiddo. :-)
I can't tell you how happy it made me watching the video.. the little girl bouncing around at the end was wonderful. I'm sure you must be familiar with R. Crumb and His Cheap Suit Serenader's but I thought I'd post the link. There appears to be no video available of those shows but I'm not surprised. Happily, the music can still be found and it appears your friend, Dr. Kickbutt is the best kind of fan. Check out 'My Girl's Pussy' (blue cat cartoon version) if you go to the link.
I hope the cheese was on a bread stick.
Wowswers....Nunly is back .... ana already trying to educate me! Sheesh! Ok....I'll follow instructions....just don't hit me with that ruler, huh?
Susan....oh, yeah, I forgot about Crumb....certainly the same ethos. Sometimes a Dr. Kickbutt show seems like a lesson in cooperative,creative anarchy ....nobody agrees on where they are going, but all agree that they should go there together.
And the cheese scones at the coffe shop are fantastic!
nope...never found out what cheese on a stick is. Got gumbo-ed in with the Lafayette Rythm Devils.
Sounds like you're having a great time!
I won't say anything about cheese on a stick seeming somewhat phallic....;-D
it rained here in Indiana and was COLD if you can believe that!!! so it wasn't the best 4th of July ever but we did go visit our daughter, since it's her birthday, and see the grandkids. was too tired to party anyway and I went to bed early. glad you had a swell time there.
three days of rain and no cheese on sticks....
nyc is sorely lacking
Chicago weather was picture perfect for the 4th, sunny and dry with temps in the low 80's...couldn't be better! I did notice that the neighborhoods were blasting off fireworks almost like the old days when it was legal to have your own. You could smell the distinct aroma of sulfur in the air from the exploding bottle rockets and firecrackers. I'm sure there were a number of dogs and cats hiding under the beds and shaking throughout the evening...or in a drug induced sleep from the tranquilizers their owners had to give them. Lucky for me, my dog is unaffected by the noise...and she even managed to corner an opossum in the yard (she had no idea what to do next, so it just walked past her and went under the bushes). All and all, a good evening for all in the Nunly household.
Cold in Indiana?.... No cheese on a stick in NY??? This was one of the better 4th's weather-wise. Lotta biking & music.....I like live music, in small venues, especially when it is free. Free is a good word. Especially on the 4th. A great way to celebrate what Freedom's we have left.
No if I can just get some free beer and cheese to go with the music!
ME.....you surprise me! A good dog owner would have taught the dog what to do with a possum! YOU should have chased it up a tree and barked at the varmint....then the next time your little pup WOULD know what to do!
Dr. Kickbutt looks like Oldman in Dracula!
...and you should see the rest of the band, my friend!Access your Mac's files securely from anywhere in the world by web browser or iPhone, via...

I cleaned my office due to the fact I had misplaced my camera. The camera ended up being in the back seat of the car…. It had fallen out of my purse.
I cleaned my bedroom, which meant finally putting away two baskets of clean laundry and changing the sheets on the bed.
I updated training materials for work which I will need in November when I give my next training.
I mowed the lawn, which took care of some leaves which had fallen…. Still many leaves left on the trees.
I went for 1 hour and 15 minute walk with neighbor friend Sue one evening after work… it was mild and beautiful… and I saw the full moon rise in the eastern sky.
I renewed my driver’s license, AND got my updated insurance cards put in both cars. Usually they float around in several piles of papers for months before they get rediscovered.
I got my hair cut…. This was weeks over due.
I avoided picking up the phone whenever I saw a caller ID I did not recognize. I easily avoided 5 political calls per day. Oh ya, this week I also voted absentee, so no need to waste your phone calls on me.
AND I seem to have gotten my energy back this last week, probably in part to a wonderful acupuncture treatment I had last Tuesday.
Weekend update tomorrow……There are no shortcuts to any place worth going. Find joy in the journey!
SEED OF WORK IN PROGRESS In every moment, you have and are all you need to be. You are a beautiful work in progress, becoming exactly what each moment demands.

Lancaster | Feb 07, 2013 | Comments 1
By JAIME HERNANDEZ
The day is fast approaching. The day that has all people in relationships running around, gathering chocolates, a teddy bear and the perfect present.
But, one obstacle remains: What to do for that special someone on Valentine’s Day? Cook? Go out? Spend some time in a nice, private location? If you’re still trying to throw together some plans, look no further! Here are a few places you might want to consider:
It’s always great to spend some time with nature.
For those who don’t mind a little drive, Mount Lemmon might be the ideal location. There are several spots on the mountain that provide a beautiful view off the side of the mountain.
If Mount Lemmon’s high altitude sounds a little too chilly, consider Sabino Canyon. The scenery is to die for, and bundling up won’t be quite as necessary.
Carefully add a little candlelight and you’re left with an amazing view and the opportunity for a memorable picnic.
If outdoor activities aren’t your thing, consider one of Tucson’s noted restaurants:
Brio Tuscan Grille, located inside the Tucson Mall, stands out against most Italian restaurants because of its incredible atmosphere. Prepared by some of the best sous chefs in Tucson, the food is delicious, it is also very affordable.
Wildflower, located near Oracle and Ina roads, is another great option with a nice, romantic atmosphere and new American cuisine. The outdoor patio overlooking the Catalinas provides a breathtaking view.
Remember, any restaurant is bound to be packed on Valentine’s Day. Don’t forget to call ahead and make a reservation.
Of course, there’s nothing wrong with a quiet evening at home.
Rent a movie, cook dinner together and enjoy each other’s company.
Don’t stress too much about lining up the perfect evening.
Valentine’s Day might have a reputation for being a superficial, commercially-driven holiday.
However, the key to having a memorable, romantic evening is being relaxed and focusing on the person you’re with.

Nice and Helpful article! Well Done!According to the latest issue of the Official Xbox Magazine, Medal of Honor: Warfighter will be the sequel to the 2010 reboot and is again being developed by Danger Close Studios for an October release.
I'm glad that Danger Close is working on the multiplayer this time. I enjoyed the single player even though it was short. However I didn't really enjoy the multiplayer because it felt like DICE didn't really try.
DICE used MoH's multiplayer to test out some parts for BF3's multiplayer. Then the rest they filled in with BC2's multiplayer.
Test out what? They didn't use what I thought was really important in the first game: score streaks.
Yeah, i got that feeling too...
The name is a bit cliched. Since when was a MOH game about anything other than fighting wars?
Sniping ruined the MP and by the time Dice addressed the issue, being too busy with BF3 preparation, the game was dead. The map used for the beta was the only map where snipers could not rule. It was laughable, even as those that only sniped joked about how they were racking up scorechains and dropping JDAMs they were the architect of destroying the game they claimed to love.
They toned down the multiplayer for some reason on that game not at all like dice to do so
but the amount of spawnkill in MP killed it for me! broken spawn point FTL!
Can't wait to see it on Frostbite 2! XD
Yeah, I'm so excited to see Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter....erps......I mean Medal of Honor Warfighter........burp
You mean: Medal of Honor: Point Gun at Enemy, Pull Trigger?
Warfighter....
Medal of Honour - Battleman Medal of Honour - Conflict-Stomper Medal of Honour - Warzoner Medal of Honour - Gun Shooter Call of Duty - Project Iron Sights Call of Duty - Dogs of Battle-War Call of Duty - Medal of Victory Call of Duty - Answer the phone Call (of duty)
Call of Duty 10 - brush your teeth Call of Duty 11 - scratch his balls Call of Duty 12 - forever alone
Medal of Honor: Pull the Trigger to Shoot the Gun
Medal of honor - Playboy operation Medal of Honor - Layoff Medal of Honor - Candy arse Medal of Honor - Tits of Europe Medal of Honor - Crying-to-your-mama Call of Duty - Kotick's Warfare Call of Duty - EA assault Call of Duty - West and Zampela trial Call of Duty - overrated Call of Duty - Multi-billion profit Call of Duty - Kindergarten Call of Duty - Voice chat trolling Call of Duty - Xbox live verbal abuse Call of Duty - Gay marriage Call of Duty - Same sex marriage Call of Duty - Pay-activision-double-the-pric e Call of Duty - Expensive DLC ops! And last but not least.... Call of Duty - Kotick's Bazillion assets and liablities
Ccccc-ombo breaker. On a side note I'll just leave this here.
Medal of Honor: Point Shooty Thing at Enemy, Pull Boom maker Medal of Honor: Shoot that guy, numbnutz. Medal of Honor: Fightwar-er Medal of Honor: BattleWrangler Medal of Honor: Shooting at Enemies And finally, Call of Duty: Thanks for your cash. PS: All of the above posters = WIN.
Yeah, it just sounds stupid, like something a little kid would call it. I'm really not a fan of that name but it wont really matter if the game is good.
If anything It'll become famous for its name lol
Agent_hitman killed the joke :L
What is going on here
Medal of Honour- Fenton! Fenton! lol.
Lol yes you will. They'll put in a beta for BFBC3 and you will buy it.
Lol!! indeed xD
I disagree because i will be buying, but that on the other hand is true. They practically said **** the game then handed out some crap dlc. Community support was horrible. Starting to make me rethink as well.
The story in MOH was deeper and more emotionally investing than any other military shooter i've played.. there was a sense of comradery, loss, campiagn was great albeit short.
The guy with the beard was awesome...what was his name again...? In short...I disagree.
Not.
Got it for $20 in the Walmart bin. For some reason the online code doesn't work, but I didn't really care.
Your right. I also fell for it day one. This is how it will go down, May - A tidbit trailer to wet your appetite; July - They tell you MOH is coming again; September - Exclusive demo on a console (which don’t even beat a mouse and keyboard); 01 October - MOH is on all game magazine as the coming of the messiah and is touted by reviewers as such; Launch day - Supermodel booth babes with exclusive press showing and me running to the store to pick one. The studios have a PHD in how to brainwash customers out of their money on yearly basis. Cash cow strategy anyone.
i loved medal of honor and im looking forward to playing this
It was truely an underrated game
A sequel to this generation's most mediocre modern warfare style game. Woopee.
Completely agree! Going from the MP beta to Danger Close's single player felt like going backwards in time. The entire feel of the game felt like COD which I personally don't like AT ALL. Going from a pretty good amount of recoil and feel of weight in gun handling in MP to a no recoil laser gun fest was WEAK.
Ya and Call of Duty is ground breaking !
Both have been done to death, become stale and started to stink. Need a more interesting genre if they want to keep shooters alive. More games in space are required.
I believe the most mediocre modern warfare game not only this gen but ever, is actually Modern Warfare itself. -_-
If you're talking about Call of Duty 4, then I disagree. CoD4 has really paved the way for a lot of modern shooters. Anyway, I never played the newest MoH but I hope they can do something with their sequel. We need to be liberated from these cookie cutter fpss.
theres been MANY modern warfare shooters BEFORE codmw was even announced
CoD4 paved the way? Funny because I guess it paved the way and immediately stopped being innovative the second it came out, because every sequel to it has been trash, as well as any game inspired by it (Homefront, anyone?) CoD4 was a nice game, but that was it. And there were tons of modern combat games before CoD4 was even though of, like Battlefield 2, some of the Desert Storm games, Full Spectrum Warrior, SOCOM, etc. Honestly, all CoD4 did was have the same old CoD gameplay, just added in killstreaks and put it in a modern setting. People saying the game was "fast" and "hectic" clearly never played any of the other CoD games before it, since they were just as fast, if not faster in some cases.
Who else thinks Warfighter is a funny name ? It's like they are trying too hard to make macho names. StrongBad anyone ?
Ghost recon advanced warfighter. I think it's too similar.
lol. Medal of Honour - Not so Advanced Warfighter
Medal of Honor: Modern Warfighter lol.
It's a military term in common usage:...
Although I did not enjoy my time with the multiplayer personally, I did find the campaign to be refreshing. There were a bunch of things that I didn't care for but I'm not going to list them all. MY main problem is that my bff(lol) lives a couple of hours away(he lives near some of my family not that you care lol). Anyways, my problem was the complete lack of any sort of pre-game lobby system. It's rough when the only time you talk to someone(aside from the occasional text) is online. Especially when you have to jump straight into a match and not even being able to say "hello" or complain about work(me) or the old lady(him) first. ANYWAY..... I'm going to be keeping my eyes on this for the time being. What actually got my attention at all is that they will now be making both the single player and the multiplayer aspects... So..... here's hoping.
Looking forward to it, can't wait to see the job they did... Hope they fixed the Lag delay though... it was the thing that i hated in the multiplayer
From my impressions EA is alternating Battlefield/MoH much like Activisons alternating development cycle of Call of Duty. Is this correct? I say this with hopes that Metal of Honor in 2012 will be what Battlefield 3 was of 2011 (2011-present).
I think so too, but EA has more to alternate with, BF, BC, and MoH, if they put 2143 as another bf3 game then they have 3 games which at their core play similar have vast differences. I didn't bother with MoH cause I played the beta and it didn't tickle my fancy.
I think they have more to alternate with, as well. I made the comparison without liking it myself. I think EA has to have a FPS-release annually in order to compete against COD. And I enjoy Battlefield3 immensely, and loath CoD. ' So an annual EA-FPS release is great in my mind. Be it BC, MoH, or BF; I'll be buying.
Ps vita Exclusive?
I'm actually glad they announced this. The first game was refreshing in it's singleplayer, orienting on the soldier's story and companionship except "'splosions and invasions and shit" CoD does.. I didn't like the multiplayer much simply because I have BC2 and they felt, looked and played the same, but Battlefield is Battlefield. Here's to hoping the next MoH won't be another Battlefield in disguise.
Warfighter? This title has already been used by Ghost Recon a few years ago. Talking about rehash ideas, MOH die hards should be concerned.
I admit that I bought Medal Of Honor on the Xbox 360 when it when on sale for like $10. I loved the single player campaign, absolutely loved it. The ability to go prone, switch the guns from semi auto to automatic. It was really great, although it was short. Then I go to the multiplayer, which played like a Bad Company ripoff, it handled so different from the campaign, no prone, no switching rate of fire, it was just bad. Now that Dice is stay away from this game, I might actually be inclined to buy this game earlier. Am I the only one that thinks EA's plan to "Not release a sequel yearly" is to release a Battlefield game <Bad Company or regular> and then MOH game after? I mean it's basically the same cycle as COD, 2 year game cycles.
I actually really enjoyed the SP of the last game. Quite keen to see what they will do next.
I liked the last MOH. Not the best game, but it was really gritty in its realism which is hard to find these days. I'm also glad to see DICE isn't developing it because They need to focus on BF. And if BF and MOH are alternating then MOH should focus on the ground warrior with small objective based game modes in multiplayer with 2 to 4 squads of 4, and have a HEAVY focus on gun customization. NO PERKS or KILLSTREAKS PLZ. also they should bring Combat Mission back
Milk it like Activision EA Modern Warefare then Black Ops Medal of Honor then Battlefield
Thanks for stating the obvious. Everybody knows EA is going with a schedule like this assuming everything goes well for those games: 2012: MoH 2013: BF:BC3 2014: MoH 2015: BF4 (or maybe another spin-off) 2016: MoH 2017: BF:BC4 (or a spin-off) The 2014 MoH is probably gonna be the first next-gen flagship shooter from EA.
For those of you who are saying that this game is going to be the same thing as the last MOH should try reading the article. It says that this MOH will not be co developed which means the SP & MP will be a more cohesive experience. Also it looks like it will be using frostbite 2 which is going to make a big difference in the way the game looks and plays especially when you consider frostbite 2 is designed to run at 60fps just like id Tech 3 (the COD engine) and if Danger Close decides to go that route we might be seeing yet another strong alternative to COD.
Treyarch, Danger close, Sledgehammer, Dice... These guys are going to get their shit pushed in by RESPAWN ENTERTAINMENT
we literally know NOTHING about their project. I can't exaggerate this point enough. NOTHING = what we know about Respawn's first game
why dont they just name them like Madden Medal of Honor 2012!!!
wasnt there a cover system in the campaign? itd be interesting if that translated to the MP, but unfortunately it didnt. I liked the MP, but it did feel like a toned down battlefield.......whether thats "bad" is up to the individual player, all I know is EA just seems to be trying to attract the COD players that dont like BF to this game. This gen it seems to be all about getting some of that COD marketshare.....smh hence how every title is an FPS. -___-
Medal of honor Campaign was pure awesomeness
Why keep hyping up Dice? A lot of the games they make feel unfinished. Especially Medal of Honor.
the ghost recon games were more advanced..
I loved sp of moh 2010 especially the last mission since that was base off a real event and you actually felt something when Neil Roberts (rabbit) dies. I think Danger Close did great job just showing off the best they could to what the real U.S. soldiers do and go through in sp. I hope Danger close does that again and pushes the sp more and makes it a lot longer. Now mp is indeed of a overhaul tweaking and fixing. Moh 2010 had a good mp but it felt so much could still be done to it and it was trying to be cod but also bf and didn't work as well as it should.
I have to say, though, they didn't portray Rabbit's death as it was IRL. He apparently fell out of the Chinook with only a pistol and 2 grenades. His LMG didn't fall out with him, he ran out of ammo, and they took him and shot him. Bit different than it was shown in the game....
I'm glad that Danger Close is working on the multiplayer this time. I enjoyed the single player even though it was short. However I didn't really enjoy the multiplayer because it felt like DICE didn't really try.
Can't wait to see it on Frostbite 2! XD
Warfighter.....
i loved medal of honor and im looking forward to playing thisManifest to provide a dynamic platform for cultural exchange throughout the region, it takes place every two years in a different European city. Along with the Venice Biennale and documenta in Kassel, Manifesta is one of the foremost art events in Europe..
New Productions: Artists and their Hosts
For “What People Do for Money” 30 international artists are developing projects with “hosts” of their choice, representatives of different occupations. The results of these encounters will be exhibited at the hosts’ respective workplaces (the so-called satellite venues) as well as at the main Manifesta venues – in the well-known Zurich art institutions Migros Museum für Gegenwartskunst, LUMA Westbau / POOL, Kunsthalle Zürich and Helmhaus. Starting with the first one this past month, the new Manifesta projects are being inaugurated one by one at the satellite venues by the hosts and their friends..
Pavillon of Reflections
Centerpiece of Manifesta 11 will be the Pavillon of Reflections, a floating platform erected on Lake Zurich. Here, visitors will be able to witness crucial moments in the creation of the artworks as captured in a series of movie productions. Curator Christian Jankowski about the project: “In the daytime, the Pavillon of Reflections will function as an urban island, a meeting place and open-air swimming area, while at night it will turn into an open-air cinema.”
Cabaret der Künstler – Zunfthaus Voltaire
The traditional guilds of Zurich inspired Christian Jankowski for the concept of Manifesta 11. In conjunction with Manifesta 11, Zurich’s 27th trade, the guild of artists, was founded in March 2016. For this purpose, the entire historical building at Spiegelgasse 1 will be converted into a guild house from June 2016. Admission to the Cabaret der Künstler – Zunfthaus Voltaire is reserved for guild members only. Artists are called on to hand in proposals for guild membership with performances realized in conjunction with non-artists.
Mediation Programme
Manifesta aims to better understand contemporary art and the role it can play in society. With every edition of Manifesta, the education department has played a central role in the conception of the biennial. This Manifesta will be no exception: the mediation team has developed an education programme which focuses on the question of how participation can contribute to generating a heterogeneous art audience.
Parallel Events
Each edition of Manifesta is accompanied by Parallel Events. Their aim is to highlight various aspects of the local and regional art scenes and to create a dialogue between them and the main exhibition.

Winter is leaving — hallelujah!
Damn, seasons changing is awesome.
If we kept every year at a fixed 365 days, the months would gradually shift with the sun until in 750 years' time, June, in the northern hemisphere, would fall in the middle of winter.
During the dry months, the 85-acre Lost Lake vanishes and turns into a meadow thanks to two hollow lava tubes at its bottom.
We saw the very best of cherry blossom festivals, snowstorms, sunshine and crunchy autumn leaves in your photos.
Thanks to astronomical quirks, spring will end, and summer will begin, just a little bit earlier in the year.
Heavy snow blankets literally make everything quieter. ...My interview was Friday...it went awesome! I should have blogged about it Friday, because by Tuesday I had an answer - NOMINATION!!
Basically, my interview included normal interview questions, but the last 20 minutes or so were more personal questions. Like, how I'm going to handle different types of food, or perhaps very minimal living conditions (think mud hut). She also asked me how I would react to witnessing domestic violence, especially in a place where it wasn't taken seriously (against the law).
My interview felt really successful, in fact my interviewer told me that I seemed to "be a perfect fit for the Peace Corps." So, I had high hopes going into the weekend and following week.
The interviewer called me on Tuesday (while the little girl I babysit was asleep) and gave me the good news!! YAY! First, she asked me about my departure date. On my application I wrote that I would be ready to leave on August 1st. However, she had an assignment that she felt I was qualified for that begins in mid July. I readily and excitedly said I could start in June if need be. She then asked me if I knew how to ride a bicycle - yes! Then she asked if I would be willing to take a course in French - yes! Soooo I'm tentatively scheduled to go to NW Africa (where they speak French) in Mid-July and teach English (among other things)!! woohooo
This assignment is contingent on me quickly and successfully completing the medical requirements (Physical, Dentist and Eye Doctor) and the placement officer agreeing that that's the best place for me (usually the case). I am nervous and excited and everything else. I'll be taking French 102 in the Spring (so I have to try and catch up with 101 over break to be successful in 102...GU doesn't offer 101 in the Spring, unfortunately).
Soo, I won't know more for a while, but I think I should get in the habit of blogging, so people know what's going on while I'm living somewhere where I can't just call anyone up :)Math Games - Fun 4 the Brainmath games Free educational games, review and learn addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, english, and science.

Instead, it will be adorned with $40 million worth of decorative touches, including palm trees, roadside spires and colorful sound walls.
In the not too distant future, Interstate 4 no longer will be your typical bland highway.
Instead, it will be adorned with $40 million worth of decorative touches, including palm trees, roadside spires and colorful sound walls.
Picture the faux Golden Gate Bridge on State Road 408 over Lake Underhill or the Conroy Road interchange with I-4, which has spires, the seals of Orange County and Orlando and extensive landscaping.
Now spread that over a 21-mile stretch of the highway, from Kirkman Road through downtown Orlando to State Road 434, to get an idea of what the Florida Department of Transportation and several counties and cities envision.
The work is expected to be part of a $2 billion expansion of I-4 that includes the addition of four toll lanes. It could begin in late 2014 or early 2015. Completion is expected to take at least five years.
State officials call the project a legacy for the region. And that's why they want it to look good.
"It impacts a lot of communities. We'll spend some money to make this project better than the standards the department usually builds to," said Beata Stys-Palasz, FDOT design project manager for I-4.
The enhancements should be special, Stys-Palasz said, because the nearly 200,000 motorists who drive the interstate through downtown on any given day will be looking at them for decades.
"Aesthetics matter," said FDOT spokesman Steve Olson.
That argument does little for Doug Head, chairman of CountyWatch, a bipartisan group that monitors public spending. He said such expenditures are a waste of money.
"I think the problem is highway engineers are the last people in the world to be making decisions about art or beauty," Head said. "No matter how many palm trees you plant, a highway is a highway."
But that's not how Orlando officials see it.
"We want to be a positive element for downtown," said Holly Stenger, a city architect.
Making the highway more than just concrete and asphalt is important, she said, because I-4 splits downtown. In fact, city officials want to create what they call a "bridge district" beneath the interstate, which is elevated through downtown.
"You should feel almost invited to go there," said Charles Ramdatt, Orlando's deputy public-works director.
All told, the state expects to spend $20 million in the downtown area on improvements, with pylons along the road, and sound walls that will be tan or other colors rather than just gray concrete and will be decorated with patterns rather than flat surfaces.
The overpasses at Colonial Drive and Lake Ivanhoe will have "gateway features" that could include the city name and lighting that's more decorative than the utilitarian poles now on the interstate. Palm trees and ground cover will be planted as well.
"We need to stop looking at these [roads] as a basic utility to get from one place to another," Ramdatt said.
Winter Park also has big plans for its two interchanges with I-4, especially the one at Fairbanks, which they consider to be the main entry into the city. The state has set aside about $1.1 million for the two roads.
"The aesthetics of the corridor are extremely important," said Troy Attaway, Winter Park's public-works director.
At Fairbanks, there will be landscaping that could include palms and shrubs, as well as terraces with plants. As with Orlando, the exact look will not be known for a while because the private company responsible for the work has not been selected yet by the state. That should occur next year.
Winter Park already is investing nearly $7 million improving Fairbanks Avenue from U.S. Highway 17-92 to I-4. The city is putting in new sewer lines and decorative lighting, plus bricked crosswalks.
Altamonte Springs is supposed to get about $2.4 million worth of work on its State Road 436 interchange and the Central Parkway link.
Much of the attention will go to 436, the main drag through the city, said Tim Wilson, the city's growth-management director.
Altamonte Springs will be written on the overpass and it will have landscaping, colorful walls and decorative lighting.
"We're trying to create a theme," Wilson said. "It makes a better impression than a blank wall."

That's the sort of mask I use, Dee. Being a mouth breather if I didn't have a full mask I'd have needed a chin strap to keep my mouth closed and keep me from breathing through my mouth and gaining no benefits. A chin strap (they tried one the night of the second test that was to see what level of air pressure I needed etc) just caused my erythema (hot red skin) to flare.
I'm fortunate that my machine has a heated humidifier, but I can leave the heat off so it's a cool water humidifier. I found out if it's really humid in the room and I have the heat on, I get condensation inside the mask and it wakes me up (cause I'm about to drown!). Not really but it's weird.

However, keep in minds that come without certain trials and tribulations that are part of being a homeowner. From maintenance expenses and upkeep to acquiring and managing tenants, owning property can be a drain promptly and resources if not run correctly- that is exactly what a university property management company does. These companies are paid by the property owner to care for the nuts and bolts that are associated with control.
Higher Quality Tenants
Between the many jobs of a property manager is to find quality prospects to fill vacant properties. They thoroughly screen people by examining factors such as their rental background and credit rating, calling their references, and even meeting with them to determine whether they would be a good tenant. This process ensures that properties and so are with desirable renters that will care for the space, make their repayments on time, and develop a steady income for the house owner. Affordable property management Las Vegas companies have vast experience sorting through applicants, and can location warning signs and red flags easily.
Shorter Openings Cycles
The particular owner isn’t making a profit in circumstance their property isn’t busy. Actually unless they own the property outright, during times of vacancies owners typically have to make the mortgage payment away of their own pocket or purse. When a property is occupied tenants’ rent can be put toward the loan payment or used as income. Property management companies care for marketing and advertise properties to the appropriate audience and see that the vacancy is filled.
Better Tenant Preservation
Tenant turnover requires additional time and money to clean market and fill up the space, all of which is costly for owners. To avoid renouvellement and vacancies retaining quality tenants is imperative. Real estate management companies serve as a spot of contact for tenants and are immediately attentive to their needs. If perhaps there is a concern that should be addressed it’s their job to handle it, and they continue to work hard to keep quality renters satisfied. Property managers also take care of lease renewals and are aware of the market, so they learn how to entice tenants to stay.
Punctually Payments
Property owners don’t generate income if their tenants don’t make their rent payments in time. That may seem to be innocent to overlook one late repayment, but once a structure of truancy is founded it can be a difficult hole to dig out of. Inconsistent repayments can put a heavy financial strain over a homeowner who has to cover the mortgage costs away that belongs to them pocket-punctual rent collection is important for regular cash stream. Rather than owners working with awkward confrontation and repeated excuses, it’s a property manager’s job to accumulate rent promptly and enforce the lease arrangement if payment conditions are not met. An affordable property management Las Vegas company is also well-versed in marketing your property and positioning advertisings where it will appeal to tenants.I ve never written something 70,000 words.

Until the preeminence of the Coalition of Progressive Electors in the November 2002 civic elections, the received wisdom for most of Vancouver’s political establishment was that the root of the Downtown Eastside’s woes was a supposed concentration of social housing in the neighbourhood. The logic runs like this: social housing is for poor people; if you build it, they will come and, in the Downtown Eastside, they have arrived. A similar line of reasoning has been followed with regard to a perceived concentration of services in the area, which also “attract” poor people. In both cases, the poor are seen as a burden, a source of inconvenient problems like drug use and prostitution that they inflict on the rest of us if they are present in too great a number. The problems of the Downtown Eastside would be fixed, according to this argument, if its low income residents were dispersed, possibly by locating social housing and services in other parts of the city (the humane solution) or, if worst comes to worst, by wholesale redevelopment, i.e., gentrification (the practical solution).
The public proponents of this view included not only The Vancouver Sun’s sometime urban design critic, Trevor Boddy (who advocated it while waxing eloquently over the beauty of a recent social housing project on Cordova Street)[i], but two people who should know better, former Vancouver Mayors Mike Harcourt and Art Philips. Both had been involved with the area more than thirty years ago, long before it was a significant site for social housing. But neither chose to remember that even then the neighbourhood was the poorest in the city. Nor did they choose to remember that the rapid increase in social housing in the Downtown Eastside can be traced to two particular sources with which both should be familiar.[ii]
First, the market housing stock that dominated the Downtown Eastside for decades – single room occupancy (SRO) hotels – was probably the worst in the city and, by the late 1960s, had become a central object of housing reformers. Second, local advocacy groups and their allies across the city demanded that social housing be constructed in the neighbourhood for the people who lived there. Contrary to the claims of deliberate “ghettoization” of the marginalized that have been advanced by people from various parts of the political spectrum, the vast bulk of social housing in the Downtown Eastside was not placed there by government fiat, but as a result of local activism and organization.
Any controversy over the placement of social housing is of recent origin and is related to the gentrification of the area that began in the late 1980s. As the move-in rate of incoming middle class property owners accelerated in the early 1990s, the area became a site of conflict between this new group, often allied with local business organizations, and those representing the low income population. As is now well-known, the conflict, which simmered for most the decade, erupted into open and direct confrontation in 1998, as the gentrifiers and businesses sought to pressure the City to apply police force to deal with the drug situation. Yet, this was only a tactical move. For the better part of the 1990s the conflict had centred, not around drugs, but around issues of housing, services, and development. Because of the panic that ensued when health authorities declared that an HIV/AIDS epidemic was in progress among intravenous drug users, the drug issue provided a key vector for stigmatizing social housing and services for the poor by forging an near-indelible connection between poverty, drug use, and disease (Sommers & Blomley 2003).
It is not clear whether this link will indeed be permanent, given the defeat of the Downtown Eastside gentrifier and business groups, intimately tied to the Non-Partisan Association (NPA), in the civic election.[iii] But, whatever the outcome, such a development is something of an irony given the tortuous history of social housing in the Downtown Eastside, a story that begins with the proposed urban renewal in Strathcona more than 50 years ago.
In the late 1940s, the City commissioned Leonard Marsh, the founder of the UBC School of Social Work and influential member of the League for Social Reconstruction – which played a key role in the formation of the Canadian welfare state – to detail a vision for its plan to clear the “collar of blight” that surrounded the downtown peninsula. His proposal for the urban renewal of Vancouver’s East End district was published in the wake of a housing crisis in the city. Only two years before, returning veterans and their families had moved into newly built houses on Renfrew Heights from the old Hotel Vancouver building at Georgia and Granville, which they had occupied in 1946, demanding adequate housing (Wade 1994).
Marsh proffered an image of a modern, high-rise neighbourhood that would rise on the literal ruins of the old wooden buildings that were then seen as defective slum premises. Yet, when he wrote his report, entitled Rebuilding a Neighbourhood, in 1950 Marsh certainly wasn’t thinking that, half a century later, the houses in the neighbourhood that he had dubbed Strathcona would be selling for close to half a million dollars or that the area that he had envisioned as a paragon of progressive, modernist planning is one of Vancouver’s trendiest neighbourhoods. The still-standing houses that would have been leveled and replaced with concrete, brick, glass, and pavement are now among the most desired in the city and are fetching a fortune. The streets that surround them are green and leafy, lined with SUVs and beemers. The neighbourhood is considered to be a vital centre of Vancouver’s burgeoning arts scene. One Strathcona block was the city’s inaugural “most beautiful block.”
This “renaissance” was only made possible by the revolt against urban renewal that began in the late 1960s as Strathcona residents, most of whom were Chinese-Canadian, were joined by academics, students, community organizers, and westside heritage supporters to derail the City’s plans to level the neighbourhood and push a freeway through it (Ley 1994). Yet, by the very same token, it was this same combination of forces that promoted the vision of social housing and services for the poor (Sommers 2001).
The neighbourhood that is now called the Downtown Eastside, but was then widely known as the city’s skid road district, was also slated for demolition. By the mid-1960s, civic authorities saw urban renewal as a means of dispersing the skid road population, a move that was resisted by the mostly church-based agencies then offering services to residents.[iv] It was not until the area became a site for community organizing and countercultural activities, as well as an object of the burgeoning heritage preservation movement, that a serious challenge was mounted to the City’s plans.
But it was not only urban renewal that was at issue. Students and community organizers swarmed through the Downtown Eastside and Strathcona (as well as all the other inner city neighbourhoods)[v], helping residents set up public housing tenants associations, studying health issues, organizing legal clinics, daycares, and a range of other activities. In 1972 the newly-formed Vancouver Community Legal Assistance Society delivered a report to City Council detailing its investigation into conditions in the SRO hotels that housed the bulk of the district’s population.[vi] The primary reason these accommodations were so abysmal, the report claimed, was that City bylaws were not stringent enough and City building inspectors did not use the bylaws that were there. The City retorted that there was no point in either enforcing or strengthening its bylaws because the people who lived in the hotels were the real problem: if a landlord did repair a building, it would soon be wrecked by the carelessness and neglect of its tenants.
Such a challenge did not go unanswered and by the time the Downtown Eastside Residents’ Association (DERA) was officially formed the following year, the condition of housing was perhaps the key organizing issue in the community. DERA made its name, and changed the public recognition of the neighbourhood, through vociferous activism aimed at slum landlords, shoddy business operators, and neglectful politicians and bureaucrats. When landlords let their buildings slide, DERA picketed the premises and drew media attention to the situation.
This local activism combined with the election of a moderate reform council at the city level in 1973, and a left-wing provincial government, elected the previous year, to put housing on the public agenda. The City began to work with the Central Mortgage and Housing Agency (now CMHC), the Federal government housing group, and BC Housing, to initiate a series of housing projects for senior citizens in the mixed residential-industrial area northeast of Main and Hastings. Changes to the National Housing Act had enabled non-profit organizations to receive Federal funding for housing and by the early 1980s, several groups, including DERA and the First United Church, were either already operating or planning housing projects for the area.
The involvement of non-profits in direct housing provision and management would have a number of implications for the community, not all of them positive. First, local management of housing meant that project operators were more responsive to the needs and interventions of the community itself. As social housing has proliferated in the community over the 1980s and 1990s, SRO tenants have had increasing access to a better quality, low-rent alternative. Second, it began to stabilize the housing situation by taking land off the property market and vesting it in public ownership. However, because most social and cooperative housing in the area sits on land that was either already owned or acquired by the City for housing construction, the community has gained no equity from this process. Third, as landlords, housing organizations are placed in the position of exercising authority over their tenants. Groups that once sought to represent and advocate on behalf of the community to the outside power structure were gradually resituated in the minds of many residents as the local face of that structure. Finally, the requirements of housing provision are such that organizations become more and more preoccupied with project management, effectively diverting their energy and resources from community advocacy.
The emergence of community-based housing organizations thus marked a shift in community institutions, away from activist interventions toward increasing cooperation and mediation with the local state (Ley and Hassan). This took place at precisely the same time that the entire City, but especially the Downtown peninsula and the inner city neighbourhoods that surround it, underwent a profound transformation that was the product, in part, of increasing investment in property development, spurred on by zoning changes.
Since 1970, the inner neighbourhoods of the city had been bleeding their once substantial stock of cheap single rooms. Once estimated at more than 20,000 in 1970, the stock now numbers less than 6,000 rooms (City of Vancouver Housing Centre 1995). The sweep of gentrification that began in the late 1970s in Kitsilano and moved eastward through Fairview Slopes and up to Main Street, in the decade following, decimated much of the stock outside the Central Business District. Meanwhile, fires and bylaw closures in the Downtown and West End during the 1970s and 1980s were soon accompanied by intensifying redevelopment pressure that began shortly before the Expo ’86 world’s fair. As redevelopment proceeded apace through the 1990s, property values skyrocketed, and as home-buyers began looking east for cheaper property, gentrification took root in the neighbourhoods like Strathcona and Grandview, where there had once been a plentiful supply of single and housekeeping rooms.
While it’s true, as civic leaders continue to point out, that since the late 1980s, the construction of social housing in the Downtown and Downtown Eastside has kept pace with the loss of SROs in those areas, it is also true that the situation is more complicated than a simple one-to-one swap. For one thing, there has never been a complete overlap between the tenants of each kind of housing. Some of the city’s early projects were designed for the so-called hard-to-house population – the same people that bylaw inspectors had once blamed for the deterioration of the hotels. However, for the most part, social housing has been constructed for the most stable elements of the low income population – not only in the Downtown Eastside but all over the city.
In the Downtown Eastside, much of the older, longer term population moved out of the hotels into the new social housing projects. A recent survey of the SRO population found that hotel residents were both younger and more unhealthy than had been the case 10 years earlier (Main and Hastings 2001). Many of the people who now live in the hotels require the kind of social and health support, along with decent accommodation, that is only provided in places like the New Portland Hotel and a few other projects.
This situation is made even more complex by three other intertwined elements. One, already noted, is the virtual redevelopment of much of the Downtown peninsula and the inflow of some 25,000 new residents, together with the mostly upscale services they demand. As in Strathcona and the Downtown Eastside, middle income homeowners and renters dwelling in shiny new high-rises and townhouses rub shoulders with the poor, many of whom now sleep in parking lots and doorways because the cheap rooms that once housed such people are no longer plentiful.
The second, related element, in this equation is the reorientation of the Downtown economy away from its old industrial base centre on the Burrard Inlet and False Creek waterfronts. This shift, which actually began post-World War II, was consolidated by the removal of the last vestiges of industrial activity from the north shore of False Creek in preparation for Expo ’86. It has been replaced, as in virtually every other North American city, by an economy based on producer and consumer services as well as tourism and niche sectors like design and software development. While there has been little research on the on the social effects of this service-based economy in Vancouver, some writers have argued that one of the key characteristics of service-based globalizing cities is a tendency toward labour market polarization between high wage professional, technical, and managerial sectors and lower wage workers (Sassen 2000 & 2001). Certainly there is evidence at the national level of increasing income inequality in Canada (Zyblock & Zhengxi 1997; Picot 1998).
The final element affecting housing in the Downtown Eastside is state restructuring at both Federal and Provincial levels. The withdrawal of the Federal government from new housing provision was mitigated for much of the 1990s by the continuing Provincial commitment. However, the provincial Liberal Party also has now abandoned new social housing construction. This is compounded by the ongoing, draconian income assistance regime (initiated under the same New Democratic Party government that kept building social housing, and intensified by the Liberals) that not only cuts rates while making it more difficult to obtain, but is now set time limits that will shortly (as of March 31, 2004) disconnect thousands of people from the social safety net. This has all taken place in the much broader context of the continuing high unemployment that resulted from the abandonment of full employment policies in the wake of the opening of national markets to international competition.
The results of the pressures exerted by all these forces, from gentrification, redevelopment, and the declining stock of SROs, to wider economic changes and welfare state retrenchment, have been visible on the street, not only of the Downtown Eastside, but all over the inner and core neighbourhoods of the city. Marginality is visibly on the increase, as the presence of homeless people, panhandlers, and an open drug market attests. Under such conditions, conflicts over both housing and the presence of marginalized groups on the streets, which have become more familiar over the past decade, will likely continue and perhaps intensify.
Leonard Marsh, the visionary of Strathcona urban renewal, would probably be surprised not only that the neighbourhood is still full of wooden houses but that only a short walk from this fashionable, renovated district are two encampments of homeless people at Strathcona and Creekside parks. Meanwhile, the proponents of the concentration thesis have been conspicuously silent about the Provincial departure from social housing provision. Of course, since there will no longer be any new social housing built, they don’t have to argue that it should be built outside the Downtown Eastside. Fifty years after the first attempt to address it, the housing question in this part of the city still escapes any resolution.

In the software development life cycle, we find that testing is an important and integral part. Most people are of the view that testing phase can only be initiated for testing once the code is ready. They are wrong!!!
Testing will in fact be initiated from the requirements gathering phase until the stage when the product goes live. i.e. into production.
Let’s see the set of documents that aid testing during the various phases of software development.
With the onus on testing to deliver quality products, it became necessary to have a set of documents that are manageable and make sense to the development community. In comes various tools that will aid the testing and development community to track these documents. These tools manage all the testing activities and provide different kinds of reports.
The most prominent one of these tools is the Quality Center.
Visible advantages of using Quality Center
1) Analyzes the progress of the testing activity.
- It is illustrated in terms of percentages for the Pass/ Fail scenarios.
2) Aids management to analyze and take future steps accordingly.
What is Quality Center?
It is a web based application that enables and provides visibility and traceability to the entire testing process from the requirements to the test result analysis.
Features of Quality Center
1) Primary a Test Management Tool.
2) It provides/ offers an organized framework for testing applications.
3) Helps in organizing various test documents and managing all phases of application testing process (This step also includes testing requirement specifications, Test Plans). The activities that are supported are creating test requirements, planning for tests, execution of tests, and tracking related defects.
The main advantage is the ability to integrate all the tasks involved in testing (for application), hence we derive the maximum benefit of the best quality products.
4) Ability to access your testing assets anytime, anywhere via a browser interface. (Accessibility is provided by means of username, password).
5) Ability to create an end-to-end quality management infrastructure
The Quality Management infrastructure necessarily means
- Requirements
- TEst Cases
- Test Results
- Test Analysis Reports
6) Manage manual and automated tests.
- Manual tests can be accessed by opening the script and testing the same. Results are provided manually.
- Automated test scripts can be referenced and the outcome can be indicated based on the outcome of the script result.
7) Analyze application readiness at any point in the testing process with integrated graphs and reports.
Requirements in Quality Center?
What are requirements?
According to the definition, the requirements includes all those tasks that go into determining the needs or conditions to meet for a new or altered product, taking account of the possibly conflicting requirements of the various stakeholders, such as beneficiaries or users. In short, this is what the client ultimately wants.
Requirements can be stated in any of the following forms
- SRS – System Requirement Specifications
- URS – Users Requirement Specifications.
Requirements can be added by selecting Requirements from the left panel.
Test Plans
It is a facility through which the user will be able to add test cases, arrange and categorize those test cases, based on need.
What is required for inserting/ creating test cases into Quality Center?
1) In orderr to add the relevant test cases into QC, we need to create testcases in the format typical for QC update (compatible to QC).
2) The test case is identified by three (3) parameters
- Subject (The details indicated under the SUBJECT will enable QC to segregate based on the first level hierarchy. E.g. It may well be your client name say “Client1”). Client1\Regression\Phase2
- TestName (Will consider the last level in the hierarchy to classify and store the related test cases. E.g. It may be a test scenario called “Offline”). Client1\Regression\Phase2\User Access
- Description (Will be an inherent part of the test case and will be visible when the user opens the test case through the test lab.
Example of a description column entry
- Objective : Verifying the Login feature to the application.
- Username : admin
- Password : n13da
- Precondition : The user should have invoked the application on any of the browsers IE7, IE8, FireFox, Google Chrome.
- Remarks (if any) :
How are test cases written?
a) Test cases are written in Excel in the format indicated below.
- Subject
- TestName
- Description
- StepName
- Step Description
- Expected Result
- Designer
- TestCase Status
- Priority
b) The “TestCase Status” column will have the entry “Design” which is later change to “Ready to Execute”.
c) Test cases are always written in Excel and later uploaded into QC.
d) As seen in the figure earlier, the Subject and TestName will identify the level of the test case.
e) Ensure that the StepName is written sequentially as “Step 0”, “Step 1”, …
f) The Description contains
- Objective
- User details
- PreCondition

Very useful blog! Keep it up.
Thanks
Software Testing
Please let me know some unique features of QC apart from the basic flow.
Hi Andy,
QC is an application that will enable the testers and the management to
1) Track the execution of the test cases which are arranged and ordered in test suites.
2) Enable the management to arrive at specific information from the metrics provided within QC.
3) Enable the testers to effectively test and trace each and every test case within QC.
4) Makes the testers job easier since it enables tracing from requirements to test suites/ test cases to defects. Defect ID in the form of URL from a defect tracking application can be copied and saved for each test case so that traceability exist when the user wants to know the reason for failure.
This blog is very useful. I want to know how to get a report of test cases wrote by a feature/folder and by a QA tester from QC 11 Test plan.
Thanks

hi sir i am ramkumar .i want into job testing
I think the test cases are written according to the field available in the Test Management Tools.
In Microsoft Test Manager 2010, there are two fields.
1. Action

If you have any Management Tools, you can also do traceability matrix with these two fields.My homemade ice coffee
Yesterday I sautéed the local swiss chard with yellow peppers and onions, make some spicy lentils, steamed kale, made a meatloaf and a yummy thick green smoothie. When I am in the kitchen with the radio on, things start to make sense. What are your grounding practices?
Here are 4 ways to keep your head above water while you go through life's ups and downs...
- Eliminate the word "should". I stop imposing thoughts of what I "should" or "could" be doing. Keep focusing on your purpose...your main vision and goals. For me, the #1 goal is to keep Kennedy in happy, healthy spirits so that she can fight to recover. I don't think of the programs I "should" be applying to, the job I "could have" kept.
- Stay positive. But how can I when THIS is going on? Not to sound cliché, but we can always find a silver lining. I have been talking about this with Kennedy. At least she will be out of school for 10 weeks. Score. At least I am off work and able to be with her. Score. More time for art. Score. See? Silver lining.
- Use less energy. Don't overwhelm yourself with to-do list as long as a Shakespearian monologue. Just keep it simple and put a few random things that will make you feel successful. Leo says Kill Your To Do List, but I simply can't do that! It's the one thing that keeps me organized and feeling like I am able to do something in a situation where I otherwise have NO control. Spend time in bed. Not crying, just being...reading/watching funny movies. Take bubble baths. Drink tea. Wear fuzzy socks.
- Remind yourself that "This too shall pass" and trust me, it will. It is simple science. The clock will keep ticking and whatever you are going through will come to pass. You will be stronger because of it. And those around you (in my case my daughter) will see the test of your character by how you responded through the crisis/chaos.
It is easy when you are walking through the fires of life to think you've fallen off the wagon. Well, we are able to breathe through the deep waters.
How does one stay healthy?
- Think about how to do the MOST important healthy things. For me that includes veggies and water
- Green smoothie daily
- 2-3 L water daily
- Salad every other day minimum
- Those simple 3 things guide my meals/menus
- I buy Gluten Free wraps and small packs of organic hummus. I then can load the wraps with tons of lettuce or veggies and BAM a healthy quick meal.
- I tend to overeat any bars that I buy so now I shy away from purchasing any; however, I will make power balls (dates, any nut, rolled in coconut give or take an ingredient or two) and keep em in a container for energy and hunger strikes.
- Once home from the hospital I'll be making a huge pot of soup for the week (the weather is conducive to it now)

You might find it surprising that Steven Spielberg‘s new journalism thriller The Post — about the Washington Post‘s 1971 fight to expose the Pentagon Papers — is the first film to unite Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep, two veteran actors so universally revered by their peers you might as well call them Mr. and Mrs. Hollywood.
But Streep doesn’t find it so hard to believe. And she offers a very sound, though disheartening, reason why.
“I think you’re mostly cast with people 20 years than younger than you are, and I’m mostly cast with people 20 years older than I am,” Streep said to Hanks when Yahoo Entertainment spoke to them (watch above). “Men usually live in dogs ages.”
Hanks admitted he thought it was “weird” that he has never been involved in a project in which Streep was on producers’ casting wish list.
“I think it has to do with age, honestly,” Streep reiterated.
And she’s got a great point.
The Post opens in limited release on Friday and nationwide on Jan. 12.
Watch Spielberg and cast discuss if The Post is a response to Trump’s presidency:

A type of riding boots that are historically worn by cowboys typically have a high heel and a pointed toe. Cowboy boots do not have laces, but instead have a long leg. This 2018 Cowboy Boots calendar features many of the exotic styles that these shoes are made from. It is not abnormal to build cowboy boots in alligator or snake skin. You will notice many of the distinctive designs in the Cowboy Boots 2018 calendar. The red, white, and blue boots on the cover are a unique manner to show a little patriotism. In the past, riding boots were exclusive to equestrian events, but they have since moved into the mainstream of American society.

Why People Choose to Have Cosmetic Surgery
We live in a competitive society where looking and feeling our best has a direct effect on how we interact in social and business settings.
Thanks to modern medicine, plastic surgery coupled with the fact that a baby boomer turns 50 every eight seconds has sparked a boom in plastic surgery. Interest in plastic surgery has doubled in the U.S. and Canada over the last years. Today’s generation has a new attitude, one that enjoys life through better nutrition, exercise and maintaining a more aesthetically pleasing appearance. It’s no wonder people turn to cosmetic procedures to improve their appearance. People today are socially active and remain in the workplace well into their sixties and sometimes seventies. Plastic surgery is safer than ever before and there is little discomfort and less downtime.
People from all walks of life are choosing to enhance their appearance for their own desire while others have cosmetic surgery to stay on the competitive edge in business and social settings.
In years past, a pulled or operated appearance was the result of plastic surgery. Today, cosmetic procedures result in a natural look, rested, more youthful appearance. Advancements in medicine and technology have improved the techniques in plastic surgery today. More than ever before, cosmetic surgery has become safer with improved recovery time and patient satisfaction.
Our goal at Robinson Facial Plastic Surgery is to restore a healthy, natural, youthful appearance to help you regain the self-image and confidence you deserve. And our commitment to you is to bring you the absolute best from our supportive staff, to our advanced skin care services & procedures, to our expert physician who delivers amazing results.
Having Plastic Surgery
More than ever before, people are turning to cosmetic surgery to freshen their appearance or correct a minor imperfection. The number of cosmetic procedures has more than tripled since 1998. This tremendous growth is expected to continue, but despite its popularity, cosmetic surgery is not for everyone.
The first step is deciding whether cosmetic surgery is for you. The decision to have cosmetic surgery is a very significant, personal and complex decision. Cosmetic surgery requires time away from work and play, financial cost, medical risk and even the possibility of disappointment for those with unrealistic expectations.
The second step is finding a qualified plastic surgeon and this in itself is a rather confusing undertaking. Unfortunately, many “non-plastic surgery trained” physicians have entered the arena of cosmetic surgery, intent to profit from the popularity of the “cash-up-front”, fee-for-service specialty. “How to Choose a Facial Plastic Surgeon” is a great resource in understanding board certification and plastic surgery specialties that are accredited by the American Medical Association.
The third step is the consultation with a qualified & experienced plastic surgeon. Have a checklist of questions to ask during the consultation. How long will the surgery take? Will there be a board-certified anesthesiologist? Are there overnight accommodations at the hospital? Are follow-up appointments included in the fee?
Preparing for Plastic Surgery
Preparing and planning for your surgery is similar to planning for a vacation. You’ll want to schedule time off from work & play and make appointments with your regular physicians for blood work and EKG (if deemed necessary by Dr. Burke Robinson). Make a trip to the grocery store and pharmacy at least a couple days before your procedure. You’ll want to stock up on cold beverages, yogurt, soup, saltines, ice compresses and don’t forget to fill the prescriptions to the pharmacy.
Dr. Burke Robinson or our team of Certified Medical Assistants will ask.
To tell or not to tell is the question. If you are uncomfortable telling your friend and coworkers you are having cosmetic surgery, then you may want to tell them you are having reconstructive surgery or female surgery. You may want to get a new hairstyle and some new clothing to distract attention. People usually remark that you look more rested and often ask if you lost weight or had your hair done.
Plan for transportation the day of surgery and have a friend or family member stay with you during your first night at home. They can help with ice packs, medications and meals.
Review your post-operative instructions with your care-giver, family members and/or friends who will be assisting you during those first 24 to 72 hours. Leave these instructions, medications and supplies on your night stand or bathroom counter for convenience.
Expect to look worse before you look better. Nearly all cosmetic surgery procedures involve swelling and bruising which tends to increase the first two to three days. Keep your head elevated and apply ice packs to reduce swelling for the first few days. Dressings, sutures and surgical clamps are removed within the first week. It’s best to drink plenty of fluids, eat before taking medications, get plenty of rest and protect your investment from any physical strain.
Always discuss any remedies with your surgeon before taking them. You may get well-intended advice from friends regarding medications or tips to speed up your recovery. Some may have merit, some do not.
An excellent resource for helpful information is Post-Operative & Recovery. You’ll find this to be very helpful in knowing what to expect after surgery, what things to avoid after surgery and what things to do after plastic surgery.
You’re going to love your new look and you’ll want to protect your investment! Remember to use medical-grade skincare treatments and products recommended by Dr. Robinson and Heather Davis. It’s like buying an extended warranty on your purchase. Best advice is to consume little alcohol, refrain from smoking, and always use a sunblock that protects against both UVA & UVB sunrays.

With over 20 years of experience, Double Board-Certified Facial Plastic Surgeon Dr. Burke Robinson has devoted his life to helping others achieve a more rested, youthful appearance while achieving natural looking results.Attachment - the quality of a child's relationship with its mother or principal caregiver - is being seen as increasingly important in psychology. Other factors can affect the context of the mother-child relationship including stressful family circumstances and marital conflict. Close, confiding marriages have been found to be associated with mothers being warmer and more sensitive with their children and fathers having more positive attitudes towards their offspring. Researchers from Purdue University, Indiana, looked at 45 pre-school children. The children were assessed to see how secure their attachment was and the mothers reported on marital conflict, physical aggression towards themselves, exposure of the child to aggression and the use of physical discipline. They found that all four factors were significantly and negatively associated with security and that physical aggression towards the mother was particularly significant.

El Paso Times
Area educators, health-care professionals and lawyers gathered Saturday to discuss a decision by the county attorney's office to seek a tougher punishment for a 16-year-old El Paso girl accused of trying to smuggle cocaine into the U.S.
"Our correctional system is so imperfect," said Cristina Cruz-Grost, a child psychiatrist and forensic expert. "We need to come together to educate and rehabilitate people who go through the system. É To place a 16-year-old in the correctional department of Texas with up to a 40-year sentence erases the potential for rehabilitation and destroys her life."
The Ysleta district student, whose name was withheld because she is a juvenile, was allegedly caught trying to smuggle nearly 50 pounds of cocaine into the U.S. The street value of the cocaine is estimated to be between $280,000 and $700,000, officials said.
Last week, a grand jury, at the request of the county attorney's office, decided to allow the teen to be tried under the Texas Determinate Sentencing statute.
Under the statute, the juvenile faces the possibility of a sentence of up to 40 years in juvenile detention facilities and in adult.
According to statistics from the Juvenile Probation Department, eight minors have been detained at the bridge in the past seven years for carrying up to 200 grams of a controlled substance, other than marijuana. During the same period, six others have been detained for carrying more than 200 grams of a controlled substance, other than marijuana.
Panelists Saturday said the figures are not enough to prove the need for determinate sentencing.
"I have to wonder if this was politically motivated," said Samuel Schmidt, a political science professor at the Universidad Autónoma de Ciudad Juárez.
"It seems that they are not really trying to rehabilitate if they are trying to sentence a 16-year-old to 40 years in prison. Did she do something wrong? Yes. Should she be punished? Yes. But to what extent?"
Elhiu Dominguez, the county attorney's office spokesman, said that the decision to prosecute under the Texas Determinate Sentencing statute does not necessarily mean that the office is trying for a 40-year sentence.
Instead, he said, the statute allows a jury the flexibility to punish the juvenile past her 21st birthday, under provisions that include prison time, probation or parole. If a minor is prosecuted in a non-determinate sentencing case, punishment would not extend beyond the age of 21, he said.
"We simply wanted to give jurors an option for a wider sentence," Dominguez said. "Our emphasis is not on incarcerating juveniles but on rehabilitating them."
The teenager's trial, originally set for Monday, has been rescheduled for 8:30 a.m. Oct. 30 in the 65th District Court. Dominguez could not verify whether the teenager has a lawyer.

UC's first-year head coach Cronin works nonstop to develop his players, both on court and off. Photo/Andrew Higley
Asked to recall his best day as a coach, Mick Cronin pauses. "That's a tough one," he groans.
Most would expect the Bearcats head coach to automatically settle on the day he got his "dream job" at UC. But he doesn't. "The feeling of euphoria and excitement when I got the job as the head coach at Cincinnati is probably something I'll never experience again," he says. "But I don't know if it was my most successful day."
The intense competitor in Cronin -- a Bob Huggins assistant at UC from 1997 to 2001, who returned to Cincinnati last year following stints at Louisville and Murray State -- would rather think his best day involved a big win or even the signing of a talented recruit.
Cronin, the son of a coach, was practically raised in the gymnasium. He played basketball "nonstop" from seventh grade through his senior year. "I was an addicted player," he admits. When a knee injury dashed his hopes to play in college, he turned to coaching high school at 19.
So, in his mind, it would seem almost a disservice to the game for his favorite moment to have occurred off the court. At the very least, his best day should revolve around the accomplishments of one of his players rather than his own.
"I know my worst day," the 35-year-old offers instead. "The day Kenyon broke his leg." That day was March 9, 2000, when, minutes into the conference tournament game against St. Louis, UC's Kenyon Martin, the consensus national MVP, fractured his fibula.
Considering that that day ranks among the most disappointing sports moments in Cincinnati history (perhaps second only to Carson Palmer's playoff-ending injury in 2005), Cronin's choice isn't terribly surprising. After all, the Bearcats, the No. 1 team in the country -- with Martin, the most dominant player in the country -- were favored to win the national championship.
What is surprising, however, is why Cronin calls it his worst day.
While fans watched the season slip away as No. 4 was helped from the court nearly seven years ago, Cronin worried he was watching Martin's career crumble. The 28-year-old assistant coach agonized over the seriousness of the injury to a player who turned down a chance to go to the NBA to return to UC for his senior year.
"I was really close with Kenyon back then," Cronin says. "The guy's bone was sticking out of his leg, and I am thinking, 'Man, oh man, this could be tragic.' But I was trying not to show that to him. I was trying to be positive with him. That was a rough day."
Cronin says people often remind him that UC would likely have won the championship had Martin remained healthy. And he agrees. But there are times, as a coach, when winning is secondary. The well-being of his players comes first.
"I always tell the kids, as a coach, my career will continue. But individual players have only one shot to make it. Fortunately, it worked out for Kenyon. (He was still the No. 1 pick in the 2000 NBA draft.) But at the time, we didn't know."
When University of Cincinnati players face adversity, boosters worry how it will affect the team's record. But head coach Mick Cronin's concern is more personal. At the time of this interview, for example, the NCAA hadn't yet ruled that Hernol Hall and Adam Hrycaniuk would be ineligible to play this year because of their participation in foreign competition.

"Everybody is concerned because they want to see those guys help the Bearcats this season," he says. "But the human aspect of it is that I see those kids every day. They're not names to me; they're people. I gotta look in their eyes and feel their pain."
Cronin's concern for his players doesn't stop the day they leave the program either. It never has. In fact, he cautions recruits that playing for him is a lifelong commitment for both parties. And to prove it, he often calls former players out of the blue to check up on them.
"When a light goes on for one of my players and I can see that he's gonna have a nice life, that he is going to be OK, that's the most rewarding time," the coach shares. "I don't want to be living on a hill in Mount Lookout, and the guys that helped me get there are struggling.
"That's why I beat on them so hard to get on their academics and get their degree. Making money doesn't happen for everybody between the lines. You have to have some options." Cronin lights up when he talks about his conversations and visits with former Bearcats such as Pete Mickeal, Att. '00, and Ryan Fletcher, Ed '00, both of whom have been successful playing basketball overseas.
"Ryan came to see me, and we spent a couple hours together," Cronin says. "He's married. He's playing, and he's investing his money in real estate and property management. That's what it's all about. He used his time here to figure out how to live off the court."
One of Cronin's favorite tactics for getting through to players is bringing in those who shared the same locker room to talk about their lives after basketball. It is a way to instill confidence that they too can be successful holding down a "normal job." Former players he has turned to include Anthony Buford, Bus '92, and Keith Starks, Ed '92, who are in finance. Tarrance Gibson, Att. '93, is a sales manager for JTM. Terry Nelson, A&S '98, is a minister and runs his own youth sports program, as does Alex Meacham, A&S '98.
"People don't know how far coaches go to try to help their players off the court," says Cronin. "You try to be there and counsel them and try to help them segue into life and be father figures to them."
According to Cronin, if his players know he believes in them off the court, they will believe in him on the court. It is a relationship built on trust.
"Whether they are six, 16 or 22, you can't underestimate the impact you have as a coach on your players. That's the most important thing. And it needs to be the most important thing."

If you must purchase a Maybelline, use one of the XXL mascaras, they are in black and white tubes. You want a mascara with a thick brush, if you have a thin brush it's not going to cover each and every lash. If you are willing to spend a couple dollars more, buy MAC's Plush Lash for $11, it is a big thick brush and will do the job.
I suggest you be really careful with apply mascara with your contact lenses in, tip your head back whilst you apply to avoid catching the skin.

No, he doesn't. That comment of Reese's was obnoxious, and if Carrol hadn't said something, then I or somebody else would have. Reese was simply repeating the classic ignorant insult that people who think they're depressed need to get more active and stop whining. He's an asshole. When you say things like that, you get called an asshole because you're causing people pain for no good reason. It's not as if we're learning anything from what the asshole emits. He's not saying it for edification (though he might believe this himself). He's saying it to have an effect on our affect, to reach into our minds and give it a nasty pinch. Presumably he does this because he's not paying attention. He knows not of what he tweaks. Perhaps it's not characteristic of Reese to engage in this kind of activity. On the other hand, why doesn't he apologize? His lapse has been made evident to him, yet he remains oblivious (no thanks to you). For some people, the failure to see what is obvious is a kind of action in itself, systematically (if unconsciously) perpetuated. Clearly, in his case it's not a cognitive disorder. We can see he's sound intellectually. If.

Point taken. But in the context it's all wrong. You're just adding your weight to this guy's delusion, encouraging the group to collectively fall asleep in it. You're trying to score a few points against your hated enemies (heh heh) at the expense of rational perception. In lesser venues this sort of thing leads to group-ego disturbance (cult).

One of the most damaging effects of the dominant school of psychiatry is the use of the loaded word "histrionic" to label this sort of speech. It's not even about hysteria. It's about attracting attention.

So do I. (Just look at my socialism, with "state" in place of "drugs"). Yet there are many more with this attitude who aren't themselves mentally ill but who nonetheless apprehend perfectly clearly that mental illness is not just a function of the imagination (mind as content rather than reality) but is somehow mentally real.

He's saying that those of us who get "clinically" depressed are simply too lazy to overcome it. The implication is that he doesn't see the profound difference between his mind and the chronically or episodically depressed mind. It makes you wish he could feel what it's actually like so if he has anything more to say on this matter, it will be an apology.

It can produce high resolution images while offering outstanding camera grip to users. Though Nokia Lumia 1020 will not be considered as a best Smartphone ever but it has capability to become the best cameraphone ever. Here is a quick glance to this tremendous device of today’s time in terms of Software, Display, Camera and functionality.
Design:
The Nokia Lumia 1020 features all the important characteristic of its predecessors when it comes to design. The technology experts were expecting unibody polycarbonate design in the device but it featured a matte finish instead of sporting glossy chassis. This subtle change will help the device to remain well protected from fingerprints and smudges.
Display:
Nokia Lumia 1020 features the ClearBlack AMOLED display of 4.5 inch. It comes with pixel density of 334 per inch and Corning Gorilla Glass3. The color reproduction of this device is quite close to the actual world if compared with AMOLED displays which are featured in other devices of Nokia. Company claims that the ClearBlack technology in this device will improve the contrast of its display, courtesy to the lower reflections on the device’s screen. On the virtue of this functionality, it is also capable of delivering good performance in bright sunlight as well.
Software:
In terms of Software, Nokia Lumia 1020 is quite similar to the other Windows phones of Nokia. The device features Smart Cam and Pro Cam along with some special programs such as Transit, Maps and City Lens. As Microsoft is successful in delivering highly consistent and stable user experience, it will not surprise users who are well acquainted with the similar kind of Operating System.
Camera:
Nokia Lumia 1020 brags about its 41 megapixel camera with special sensor inside it. It is capable of clicking pictures of either 34 megapixel or 38 megapixel, depending upon whether you are clicking it in 4:3 or 16:9 mode, very akin to what users have seen in Nokia 808. The default camera app in the device is Pro Cam which is lacking in few features found in recent devices of Nokia. However, Pro Cam provides sufficient control to users so that they can manage the shutter speed, exposure, white balance and ISO according to their own needs. These adjustments can be easily carried out by dragging the click button. The application is also extremely helpful in giving the exact preview of how the images may look when a user tries to make changes with white balance.
Conclusion:
Along with the nice phone, Nokia Lumia 1020 plays an important role of a pocket camera. In many aspects it is similar to Nokia Lumia 920. The recent updates to software have definitely enhanced its functionality and an individual who is in search of a Smartphone with highly advanced camera will definitely try to grab this phone. The ability of Nokia Lumia 1020 to capture stunning photos will make it most sought after device in the Smartphone market.Just for a moment, I would like to reiterate how complex and extensible this brave new world is. I’ve been observing it from the outside for a long time, but you don’t really get a feel for all the moving parts out there. It’s almost like the internet is a real thing you can program useful creations for. Far from the days of manually editing and uploading an HTML file. Shocking.
I figure I should start with the one I am most proud of so then it can be all downhill from there. Super Mario Blitz happened sometime around January 2003. It’s unclear and maybe someone should have kept better records. Maybe when the old site’s archives back up it will have some answers. Anyway, I thought that this was created over a summer break when I reversed my sleep schedule to sleep during the day and do everything at night. That is obviously wrong, though, because I put this up at Newgrounds in February ’03. Maybe it was made over a Christmas break. Can’t remember. This was the project that made me realize that I vastly prefer music-action synchronicity, and I should probably just make music videos to songs I like. It also features my little brother who is now eight God damn years older than he was then and has a beard.

Hey Mortis,
It’s good to see you’re back to the land of the living! I was a huge fan of your old flash stuff back when I was in high school in ~2002 and you were partly responsible for sparking my interest in animation and web graphics in general. Good times, that.
Just thought I’d say thanks! I’m looking forward to seeing new stuff from you all these years later. Assuming you’re still at it, anyway.
Mortis,
People are still here. You put up some amazing videos. I watched them on a weekly basis back when I was in high school. I think for the people who have seen your videos, there will always be a place in their memories for you. I hope you are doing well in RL.
Take care.
jeez, I can’t believe I almost forgot about this site…
I remember it being a little diffrent though.
Good to see that you’re alive.
Last year, I went to your site an a daily basis…
Good times…
This is great. This movie is the reason I re-found Mortisland.com. I am now sharing it with all my co-workers. Long live Mortis!
There’s only one animator that I looked up to more than Mortis when I was in high school. It’s good to see that one of you is showing signs of life. Hopefully you realize that your animations have inspired others, even if that wasn’t the intent. Maybe you can grace us all with some updated talent!
This movie is well done, but I’m not a fan of the song.
First visited Mortisland in about 2004 and was a regular visitor from then until a few years ago. I just randomly decided to rewatch some of your stuff and was surprised by a new site. Which needs work…
Absolutely great to see you back though, bring back the death reels in AC and DAoC!
You’ve still got fans, don’t let us down!
I stopped by to see if the old flashes were still up. Holy shit. Mortis, gotta say this, a decade ago, you were one of the only forces that kept a lonely nerd from going batshit insane. Thanks bro, and I mean it.
I didn’t realize you were bac. It was due to random curiousity after looking at Lootcrates that i thought about your site, and I am glad to see your back and would really like to see your work again. As well as the sweatshirt ideas you had.We started off on Feb 9 in the town near MamaJ's home; she was dilating like a mad woman and then... NOTHING! No more progression! Doctor mentioned augmentation or a possible c-section which this little hospital was not set up to do. {Well, they considered doing the c-section there but thankfully couldn't get the o.r. staff in to assist. I say 'thankfully' because the doctor then explained she had only ever seen one in college and proceeded to ask the nurse what she needed to do next. I. Don't. Think. SO!}
Load MamaJ into the ambulance and head here, to my hometown. I will not admit to which traffic violations I may or may not have committed on our (Jellybean and Bug were with me) trip home. I dropped the kids off at my dad's because by this time they had waited at a hospital for 6 hours and it would be a late night yet.

I lay there for a bit, seriously hoping someone saw me so they could help me up because I didn't think I was moving on my own. No one came. I decided laying on the ice wasn't fun anymore {wait! It wasn't fun to begin with! wink}. Up I got, with a few scrapes, sore bones (mostly my knees and elbows) and a little bruised pride.
Anywho, off to the maternity ward. No c-section! Oxytocin and fentanyl. Bets were placed on when baby would be born. One insisted Feb 9. 9 1/2 hours after arriving at second hospital, our dear baby was born on Feb 10! (bet lost but not by me). Bet lost about whether she was a boy or girl as well, also not by me as I had all ready bought several too-cute-to-pass-by girl outfits! {tee hee! What can I say, I am an optimist}

I mentioned the buzzВ around SiteGroundв usually it was in the form of customers raving about amazing site speed and amazingly friendly customer support. I haven't seen any builders that will create database schema sql server 2005 you to create marketplaces and the ones you've mentioned are all custom developed. 95month and including 247 support - it has become a no-brainer to use a web hosting company. SiteGround boasts of its 247 fast and dedicated support to its customers. I always have to explain a couple times what my issue is. The managed packages ibm eserver xseries 235 intel xeon 3.06ghz tested break out their entry-level plans by traffic, storage space and number of sites supported rather than our test criteria of performance. Whats the bad news. You can search for online testimonials and check for Better Business Bureau endorsement to guarantee the reliability of the company you choose to work with.

It's ibm eserver xseries 235 intel xeon 3.06ghz that this article doesn't bother to mention that Bluehost and Hostgator are owned by the same parent company, EIG. And, if their advertising makes it seem that way, then those kind of clients will be disappointed. As you'll soon see in this collection, the most difficult part of creating a professional website for a web hosting company is narrowing down your shortlist to just one theme.

The person on the other end was able to solve those at first try. However, if the closest server to you or the users you expect to be trying to access your website is a significantly underpowered one, it's best to find the closest one to you that has a reasonable amount of resources and reliability.

With self-hosting, you are in full control of your website, which makes it a very attractive options for seriousВ bloggers and website owners. However, if you are more of a DIY website owner or you are trying to save a buck, then please read on. With WooCommerce (requiring you to use WordPress), they're flexible but you do have to be a bit more technical to use that platform effectively. The 247 availability of ecommerce websites makes them drastically different from most of their brick-and-mortar counterparts. It's where a single host parcels up sections of its servers to multiple websites. Some web hosting solutions are sound options for newer websites, while others are suited for websites that receive a high-volume of traffic each month. At first, shared hosting works well for most WordPress sites, but most users upgrade their plans when they outgrow their shared hosting accounts, especially ecommerce or business sites. However, you will get unlimited bandwidth in other higher and costlier plans. If you're not happy with them you can simple ask for the refund. No matter your goals or inspirations for blogging, I hope these hosting suggestions help you find the perfect solution. What you need instead, is a trustable source (that's us!) to tell you which hosting company to go with (and which to ignore). You need a web host is operating on a powerful server and stable network connections.

Adams:.
will be hard to resist. Let’s enjoy the ride this year.
Everyone worries about injuries, but only a catastrophic injury would prevent him from being drafted next year, and such an injury is unlikely to happen. Sure, he may get hurt at some point, but that doesn’t prevent guys from getting to the NBA very often.
Nerlens Noel may be hurt but if he goes to the draft, I will bet all tha I have he is drafted in the first round, still a millionaire.
For Adams, if he goes this year, his a mid to late 1st round pick. If he stays and improves (very likely) he’s a lottery pick and he makes more his first NBA year than he would in his first 3 NBA years were he to go this year and be drafted late in the first round. Worst case, he stays, gets hurts and drops in the first round a bit but still drafted, still a millionaire and better prepared for the NBA.
The factors he should be considering (Green = GO! Yellow = Maybe, Red = Stay):
*Draft Projection
Green = Lottery
Yellow = 1st round
Red = 2nd round
*Goals/Need/Situation
Green = Immediate $$ need
Yellow = NBA dream, shaky college situation
Red = Good college situation, immediate cash not an issue
*Readiness
Green = able to compete at NBA level immediately.
Yellow = game not quite there but able to handle NBA life style
Red = physically not ready and not quite mature enough
*Risk – Two kinds of risk 1) performance risk and 2) injury risk.
Green = consensus improvement projections are too high and/or injury risk is high (think Greg Oden and DeJuan Blair)
Yellow improvement projections are reasonable and no abnormal injury risk
Red = low expectations and low injury risk
Adams Scores:
Yellow/Red – No one has him as a lottery pick, most have him in the late first round.
Red – He comes from a bad situation in New Zealand, so his expectations are low. By all accounts, his family is not pressuring him to “bring home the bacon”. His college situation is good, and will be getting better if his GF is coming.
Red – He would get his ass beat up in the NBA right now and he could really use another year to adjust to the US and mature a little more. He needs some structure.
Yellow – The improvement expectations are high, but he has been meeting them so far. I think he will continue to improve steadily and then it’ll click and he’ll dominate. If that click happens this season, then maybe I would adjust this to Green. He is a big tough kid, no abnormal injury risk.
So unless something materially changes (i.e. his projection or performance) it is a no brainer for him to stay.
See, it is all so simple when you break it down scientifically!
College sports cow down to media for the $$. When Pitt enters the ACC expect to see Thursday night ges at Heinz field. Forget about the kids who have class on Friday, it’s about TV revenue.
Steve needs to look out for Steve.
On the other hand if Kiwi Steve stays and develops his game like Aaron Gray did, Steve will be a lottery pick and have a very long and rewarding NBA career. And make much more money in the long run. 😉
Hope he’s smart enough to not look at the quick buck but the long view of things.
The fact is, we all HOPE he stays. But to suggest that another year of college hoops is better for him and his draft status is almost certainly wrong. Just ask Jared Sullinger, Perry Jones III and just about any other highly ranked player who came back only to see his stock drop.
They will be much fewer and further between than when we were in the BE.
Yes, ACC does play Thursday night games, but they have never stuck a member as the “Thursday Night” team. They have rotated them very fairly.
So, with 14 teams, and with a fair rotation, that will not happen as often as it did in the BE.
IMHO

I am in full support of athletes going out and getting as much money as they can as soon as they can. Everyone is profiting off them, this is their trade so of course go get your money.
In Adams’ case though he has not hit his ceiling. He is developing in to a very likely lottery pick, and under the rookie pay scales for the NBA lottery guys do far better as a rule (its hardly up to the team that drafts him).
If he stays he also gets more notoriety. If he leaves this year, it will be years before anyone hears of him again, until he actually gets some minutes. If he stays, and takes us to a Final Four, his notoriety sky rockets and in addition to being a lottery pick he’s in a much better position for endorsement deals. Sure, maybe no Nike but something far better than he gets if he is draft pick 14-30, with no name recognition and no chance of making a name for himself until at least 3 or 4 more years in the pros.
This is a table of the rookie pay scale. Top 5 guys make more in their first year than the picks 20-30 do over three years.
His skill level is not even close to what it needs to be in order to compensate for the fact that he looks pretty awkward while trying to get position around the basket and is not the best jumper in the world.
Doing the math, the million or two or three he would make should he elect to enter the draft this year could easily be made up by improving his game enough to become a mid to high first round pick next year.
The decision to stay another year is not that hard, unless of course you really don’t think you can get much better.
In finance, termed “appreciated assets”.
Patience is a vertue, then,,,,,SHOW ME THE MONEY!!!
If he doesn’t like what he sees, Chryst would then hire someone from the outside.
It’s well known that Chryst likes to roll the dice when it comes to playcalling.
That’s a whole other matter when it comes to hiring a guy to head up your defense when you’re coming off a six win season.
Here’s hoping Chryst is about to pull a rabbit out of his hat and it ain’t someone on the current staff.
A current example would be someone like the Plumlee kid at Duke. If he had come out after his freshman year, the draftnicks had him as a certain lottery pick. Now, not so much. No one in their right mind would say that he is not a better player than he was as a freshman, right or wrong, people have just seen him so much his ceiling has lowered. I believe this to be possible for Adams.
The counter to that argument is someone in my own backyard, MD’s Alex Len. He came back and has played his way into the discussion for #1 overall pick. The difference is no one had him as a first rounder last year, so there was less risk of hurting his stock.
My point, again, is that another year in college does not automatically mean an increase in your draft stock, even if you improve as a player. Adams needs to consider this if he is in fact a likely first round pick
Although Adams has some conditioning work ahead the only player I have seen who at 18 had an NBA body was LeBaron. As for all the centers in college in the country I agree with the concensus of the scouts Adams has the best footwork for a man his size and the highest ceiling.
If he went out after his freshman year he would be a lottery pick.
After 2 years in the NBA he will be a legitimate star.
It is obvious that he is much better compared to the confused looking player he was early this year. He still has a long way to go to become a competitive center at the NBA level and can get there for sure under Jamie’s tutelage.
He will probably be a lottery pick probably next year on his current pace of development. Another year in the weight room and improving his skill set will make him a starter in the NBA much sooner.
It is also impossible to put a price tag on the college experience. Most of us look back fondly on the four years that helped to transform us from children to adults. Once it’s over you are on your own facing life’s challenges.
I just hope that Steve has good advisers and support when he does make the transition, so he invests his money wisely to secure his future. A college education, and financial literacy skills, will take him a long way.
We all know about the athletes that squander their millions, get ripped off by their so called friends and advisers and end up bankrupt in a short period of time.
Let’s hope Pitt and his college experience prepares him for what is ahead.
So far, he seems like a genuine, level headed, team player, a credit to his country and our University. He has overcome long odds, and deserves great success. I hope he stays long enough to become a Pitt legend and then becomes a star in the NBA.
I read or heard, that they kind of have a “feeler” conversation with all of the a.d.’s, and they’ve never really had to force anyone.
But, you are correct, if S.P.’s mindset is to jump on them, then, we will.
As for the games……….
I have two points of view, and they are both very selfish!!!! LOL
I do not like games on Thursday night for Pitt, with your above mentioned concerns, and, overall, I just feel college football is for Saturdays.
However, when it’s not Pitt, I do enjoy watching other teams play on Thursday nights and glad to have games on!!! LOL
Until that time, lets just sit back and enjoy his game by game improvement. Like Emel, PantherP & others on here, I would love to see him come back next yr, develop his inside offensive game, and secure that lottery pick status, after leading Pitt to that coveted Final Four. HTP
We debated, if he would come, how good he would be, now it’s when he should leave. That’s what we do.
That said, I’m ok with one game on a Thursday night if early in the season like in Sept..Normally there is ton of stuff going on during Sept on Saturday’s so nice to free up an extra weekend and gives me a reason to take Friday off and have a long weekend.
However the Wednesday and Friday games are horrible both at home and on the road…hopefully the ACC will stay away from those games but fearing ESPN will overrule.
As far as Adams staying or going , I’m not a Ron Cook fan either but he’s got this one right. I’m not even going to waste time discussing it. It’s a win win for Pitt fans.
Don’t underestimate the fact he is an international student so he as a different point of view, and frame of reference, than a kid who grew up in BBall here in the US (not that either is better or worse, just different).
Finally, isn’t his girlfriend coming to Pitt next year for swimming or something?
as for the link to the ad above… wow… stupid + insensitivity-to-victims = fired…
For some reason, either discouraged by the coaching staff or lacking confidence (I find this hard to believe because at Addidas/N.D. Prep his ability to face the basket and score was what pumped up his ranking).
I wish Pitt would encourage him to take the 15ft jumper it would add an extra dimension to an offense that often has trouble scoring.
Pitt does have a go to man he just happens to be 7′. His hand injury may make him less confident. He can be a 70% foul shooter without all the tape – that is his game. He is more awkward with the hook shoots.
u go! Nerlens Noel anyone? before him I think Pervious Ellison at Louieville blew out a knee & was never the same.
Even Mark Blount made $$ once he got it together.
They’ve been doing Thurs. so long, and usually half decent match ups, I look forward to them, when not Pitt.
ex. #5 pick 2012. 3yr contract totals about 10M.
#20 pick 2012. 3yr contract totals about 3.5M.
That’s a big difference, at least to me.
So, to say, if he’s a 1st round pick, just go, is incredibly short-sighted.
Are there risks to coming back, sure, there’s risks with everything.
There are also upside risks.
If he’s guaranteed to be a lottery pick, ya, go.
If they’re telling him, ya, somewhere in the 1st round, then he has a lot to think about.
His stock could fall, it could also rise.
My prediction is that either the NC or Virgina game will be a Thursday nighter.
Change of topic, but if we win the next two, we will have a regular season that no one predicted. Especially after the failure of last year, again which no one predicted. Although highly unlikely, speculate on the Pitt program if Adams were to stay all four years.
I would give the same speech to Steve Adams…and yes, I know there are millions of $$ awaiting him.
It’s not selfish…it’s the truth. I believe he will stay for at least 3 years. We’ll see
I believe going to college is important, not just for learning, but to learn to interact with all other kinds of people. Those skills, the interaction skills, and your adjustment to them, will make or break you in life.
Hail to PITT!
The improvement in physique Dixon players make from year one to two is often dramatic. Given the impressive athletic ability the Pitt trainers have to work with, Adams could be physically dominant next season.
He should only go this year if he’s a lottery pick.
link to insider.espn.go.com
If it appears that is not likely, he should stay.
That could keep Adams here.
Steve’s big sister photo. If he can develop the same strength attributes lookout NBA.
Don’t know how many have played hoops on this blog, but a thumb injury severely limits just about EVERYTHING IN BASKETBALL. And a thumb injury only heals by NOT playing, as it is constantly being hit, while catching a pass, rebounding, deflecting passes, shooting, blocking shots, etc., etc.. Basically everything, even the aftergame handshake would irritate it.
With that in mind imo, Kiwi Steve’s stats would be at least 25-33% better without the injured thumb.
And being a lottery pick means a lot longer guaranteed career in the NBA for a mid to late 1rst rounder. As one only needs to look on how many from just a few years ago are entirely OUT of the League. They don’t give up so quickly on lottery picks, so I disagree most assuredly with PeteinMd. Whoever he is. 🙂
Tim Duncan staying in school all 4 years trumps any names that the other side can come up. For he is a certain NBA Hall of Famer. And he has his college degree. Mr. Duncan being from another country like Kiwi Steve saw the value of school and developing his game, rather…..
than the quick buck.
Who knows what would have become of Tim Duncan had he came OUT after his freshmen or sophomore year. Most likely he would have been a bust, as he wasn’t physically mature enough, nor was his game at that time.
The NBA will always want someone in the 1rst round who’s 7 foot tall with the athleticism of Kiwi Steve. They will always be there.

Are we sure Kiwi Steve isn’t on here, cause there’s ONLY 3 players listed.
And you are an unknown poster, lol
3.8? Pretty good stuff; all with a bum thumb.
Does it matter what the injury is? Really, what significance is there in knowing the clinical diagnosis? It is taped and he is playing. I don’t think he has received poor medical attention.
SA has a good grip on his inner self and it seems as if he is saying to the rest of the world that he has lived his life under his terms and nothing is going to change that.
He stays for one more year then off to NBA riches as a top 5 pick–regardless of what anyone at ESPN thinks.
In another year who knows? One thing for sure however, he is getting better game by game.Controls & Limited

356Right now, the mayor and homeless-help agency leaders are publicly in accord, trying to put together a plan, based on a set of key-issue areas, that can bring Stepping Stone, a legal homeless transitional-living place, into being within the next six months.
Perhaps 35% of the public, the Democratic Party of Sacramento County, and the Bee editorial board, are on-board with Safe Ground. Our compassionate mayor, despite getting knocked around, has put his political career and strong-mayor initiative at risk in pronouncing his strong support for Safe Ground.
The scuttlebutt in Friendship Park is that Safe Ground* is likely to manifest sooner (in three months) rather than later (in six months).
Instead of U-Domes or EDARs or canvas tents, the expected camping/housing structures are Tuff Sheds [see picture, which is just one of many Tuff Shed models], which are typically storage sheds but will be buffed up with drywall and lighting of some sort. And, unless somebody is teasing me, the favored name for the homeless village acoming is Eden, as in "the garden of."
What the Safe Ground Campaign should NOW do
Arrogant son-of-a-gun that I am, I am pleased to answer my pal Tipp's call that I put down in words, in a positive, constructive way what Safe Ground Campaign should now do to get home from here, to make a legal camping/housing property come into being and succeed.
First thing: While Stepping Stone is swell as a name for the homeless campground while it's an idea getting bounced about, it should not be the name of the village once it's established. Whether or not the village is a station on the way to a "normal" life for its residents, the village must function as a wholesome, settled, mostly-tranquil community and not as a way station.
"Eden," too, would be a terrible name for the village. That name is Orwellian** -- though, granted, not as ooky as the name Friendship Park. The village, when established, should have a name it can hope to live up to, or – best – a neutral name.
Safe Ground, the campaign, should now spin on a dime and begin doing what it should always have done: (1) Appeal to the whole of the public, not just the narrow liberal donation-giving base. (2) Appeal to the business community and the ideals of cleanliness and wholesomeness and responsibility and doing work, rather than in terms of grievance and childish refrains of "I want it now, wah-wah-wah."
The Homeless Community needs to start to be presented AS IT REALLY IS. The public is understandably confused. In the Oprah-fuelled media-blitz days relating to Tent City last spring, the public was told, with the complicity of Loaves & Fishes, the Bee's toady homeless-issue staffwriter and SN&R that Tent City was huge and was comprised mostly of lovely young caucasian families with todlers who missed tooling around Granite Bay in their SUVs. [Well, something like that; you know what I mean.]
The public was actively misled. [See a June The Nation article which set things aright.]
The REAL situation of what homelessness is like and who all us homeless people are is something the public should be informed about. Truth is good for its own sake. The truth also happens to be compelling. Homeless people are mighty marvelous, but with many problems, too. They don't need to be swapped out for Paris fashion models or disgustingly-soiled grizzled old men when the TV camera lights are on.
The public will be able to understand that within the undercaste there are addicts and felons and mentally ill folks, oh my! Further, the public can be taught that homeless people suffer mightily, from deprivations and feelings of unworth. Plus, the public can come to understand the Trap of Homelessness in Sacramento where it is especially difficult to get conditions right such that a person is presentable to apply for work. It's ridiculously difficult out here!
By being TRUTHFUL [a concept that will need to be taught to L&F's board and executives] instead of truthy; sympathetic to the needs and fears of the general community; and by seeking solutions to problems, rather than exclusively and childishly demanding "what I want, now," there will be broader support for the homeless, both from the people in our metropolis and the people's elected and appointed leaders in the city and county.
IMHO, ONLY by getting broader support, such that the public is behind it, and such that ordinances can be passed, will a legal homeless encampment/community come into being and succeed.
----
* I think I'm on safe ground in saying that one of the problems with "safe ground" is the meaning of the term. Today, "safe ground" means many things, including its opposite, unsafe ground. The illegal campground on C Street was called Safe Ground, while safe ground was originally defined as a legal campground. Also, there continues to be confusion about how safe ground / Safe Ground / SafeGround should be spelled. In addition to being a parcel where homeless people camp (or put up structures), Safe Ground or the Safe Ground campaign is the effort to get a legal homeless campground in Sacramento AND Safe Ground or the Safe Ground Movement is the effort led by C.W. (with articles in People's Tribune) to put an end to capitalism in our country (which in the glorious future might be called The People's Republic of Safe Ground). -- tom armstrong / Tom Armstrong / TomArmstrong
** Orwellian is defined [at wikipedia] in these terms, which apply to the village-naming issue:
- The political manipulation of language, by obfuscation, e.g. WAR IS PEACE. Using language to obfuscate meaning or to reduce and eliminate ideas and their meanings that are deemed dangerous to its authority.
- The encouragement of "doublethink," whereby the population must learn to embrace inconsistent concepts without dissent, e.g. giving up liberty for freedom. Similar terms used, are "doublespeak," and "newspeak."701 - New Deal (99)

NPR's Michele Kelemen reports from Washington that President Bush's call Wednesday for lifting sanctions against Iraq raises legal questions for the U.N. Security Council. Technically, the sanctions are to remain in place until U.N. weapons inspectors certify Iraq is free of weapons of mass destruction. But the Bush administration seems intent on sidelining the U.N. inspection teams and is instead trying to assemble its own team of inspectors.If you’re like me, you think Talbots and immediately cringe at the thought of all the “mommy” clothes that reside therein.

Cute, right? I love that green jacket and dark skinny jeans – almost makes me wish it was fall. And it seems to me that at the rate J.

The reason for this is apparently because it is good value for money.
Mercia and Karen from Daihatsu Centurion, were kind enough to let me test an automatic 1.3l Sirion for a day, and what a fun little vehicle it turned out to be. For a 1.3l automatic I was surprised by how gutsy and responsive it is. After getting a feel for its drivability, I went and visited a couple of friends who have to use wheelchairs, to get their opinion on the vehicle. The general consensus was that there seemed to be a lot of space inside the vehicle for such a small car, with a very versatile and “easy-to-change” seating setup. We also noted the size of the backdoor opening (780mm from floor to roof), and how low the “sill” was. The question that immediately came to mind was whether we could load a power wheelchair into the back of the car, up a ramp.
I knew who could help me test this possibility. I visited Lisa at Jolisa” (previously Prefect Pace Distributors). She willingly provided me with a set of ramps and a range of wheelchairs to try. The ramps into the boot fitted easily and so did the power chair – admittedly it did have a folding backrest. Due to the split folding rear seat, where 2/3rds of the seat can be folded down while the other 1/3rd can be left in position, we were able to strap the wheelchair in using the rear seatbelt, and still free up a single seat at the back. On this seat we loaded a rigid frame chair.
Two wheelchairs loaded easily into the back of a Sirion!! Even Lisa was impressed! After that we tried a standard folding frame chair which we managed to fit behind the back seat, and even close the door. It was a tight squeeze, and we had to remove the spare wheel cover, but it fitted. I checked out the size of the luggage compartment in comparison with the Getz, Citroen C2 and Kia Picanto. The Sirion has the largest packing area and door opening size, which enables easy loading and transporting of wheelchairs.
Next I looked at how wide the driver and passenger doors opened, and how easily a wheelchair could be loaded from the drivers position. The seat has manual forwards and backwards and tilt and height adjustments, however they only allow a fairly small range. I was able to move the seat back enough to create ample space to lift a wheelchair over my lap. The new Otto Bock manual rigid frame chair was a piece of cake to lift over the driver into the passenger seat. This was partly due to the internal space of the vehicle and partly due to this lovely wheelchair!
The door openings gave ample room for a wheelchair to get close, however the wide door frame makes it quite a long transfer to get from the wheelchair into the driver’s or passenger seat. The height adjustable driver’s seat made up for this by enabling me to adjust the seat to a similar height as the wheelchair seat.
It is a winner from the internal space and flexibility perspective, but what about the rest of the vehicle? The large and well designed windows give excellent visibility, which is important where a person may have reduced head movements. It has excellent safety features for a car in this price bracket, including fire blankets, impact absorption structures, pedestrian protection and passenger protection features such as 2 airbags. The brakes were phenomenal, and so they should be with both ABS and EBD (electronic brake distribution). With brakes like these, make sure that passengers are well strapped in, particularly if they do not have balance, and any wheelchairs or other luggage should be securely stowed or strapped down.
The Sirion is available in a 1.3 litre or 1.5 litre DWT petrol engine, with either an automatic or manual gearbox. This 4 cylinder, DOHC 16 valve, DWT engine gives a balance between environmental friendliness and performance with good fuel consumption of approx 5.8l/100km and low emissions which have been achieved with a compact, high performance engine. The 1.5l sports version offers nimble city driving and ample power for high speed cruising.
Current and average fuel consumption can be displayed on the LCD panel which will hopefully develop environmentally friendly driving habits.
It has a number of fun and convenient features which are all thrown in on the standard package deal. No having to pay extra for the front loading CD or air-conditioner. Some lovely features for drivers with disabilities are also thrown in on the standard package, including an electric mirror switch on the dashboard, height adjustable drivers’ seat and steering column and touch lights on the ceiling.
For drivers with limited hand function, the button on the gear lever for shifting from Park to Reverse and back could be difficult to press. The door handles may need some adaptations along with the switches for the electric windows. But these are minor adaptations compared with some of the benefits of this vehicle.
Other impressions were that it is extremely manoeuvrable with light power steering; very quiet and has clever little storage compartments conveniently located around the vehicle. Allin- all I felt that it is a very well designed vehicle, with features which make it exceptionally versatile for a vehicle of this size. With a price tag of
R119 995 (incl. vat) for us ‘able bods’, or R100 779 for those who can get their disability rebate sorted out, I have to agree that this vehicle is good value for money.Learn How to Make a Hotel Booking in Hindi.

The inevitable has happened. The sweet Christian homeschooling mother that prayed to meet me has just rejected us. She called to say that it wasn't going to work out with our kids. That Cody had hit her daughter (Cody said that she had hit him first), that other things came out, that the mix wasn't going to work. She said that she knew we were working "on issues" but she just didn't want to risk it, blah, blah, blah. I just listened and said, "okay, okay, okay". How can you argue against someone who's so immediately certain about things?
I can't tell Cody at the moment; he's ultra sensitive to the rejection side of things. I don't feel like a couple of hours of intense counseling right now.
I'm so mad and sad once again. Mad at Christian-mothers with formulas and no grace. She was so matter-of-fact about her standard and rejection. I'm just sad at mine and Cody's plight of being ostracized from the group that we belong to.
However, I know that, although she is representative, she's not the only kind out there. So, I shall just trust once again that we'll find our way somehow.
More reports to come.

If there was ever an occasion that was governed by the clock, the Torino Winter season Olympics is it.
All inclusive deals have particular advantages: Although they are gradually coming back again into style, there was a time when all inclusive packages had been not desirable. This is the incorrect position to take because these deals are extremely cheap. You simply pay the really feel and everything will be arranged. There are some unscrupulous Taxi Gatwick Reading employees who will attempt to cost you tons of cash for absolutely nothing. Make sure that they are not given that opportunity.
One of the best things about the Faro Airport is handy travel modes to and from the resort. This list is topped by taxi travels as it is noticed as the most convenient method. You can grab a taxi from the taxi ranks just outdoors the arrivals of the terminals. It is situated on the correct hand side of the exit to the terminals and therefore no hassles in finding them. euro5 is the base charge for your taxi utilization and the rest will get additional as as soon as travels a particular length.

You cannot go to this metropolis and not see the Previous Town, which is just a stone's throw from the lake. Consider the Rue St Leger up into the town and head for the Place du Bourg-de-4. This is a medieval market location that is still used as this kind of these days. It has altered since medieval times of program, and you can now take a seat and survey your environment as you sip a coffee from 1 of the charming local cafes. Don't miss St Peter's Cathedral while you are right here, or else known as Cathedrale St Pierre. The cathedral is a mix of designs that has come about via alterations and include-ons produced more than the many years, but it is still one of the most imposing sights in the Previous City.
Regular taxis (these with government issued permits) are red and have a yellow triangle on both sides of the car with their license quantity. It is a great behavior to keep in mind this number just in case you neglect something in the car. These taxis have a tax-meter. Make sure it is turned on and they charge you the amount showing.

Observing an (accidental) theme about courage running across the music I’ve been listening to and the (non-PhD) books I’ve been reading lately.
Recent highlights:
Neurotica by Eliza GordonSometimes, in cricket, the uncontrollable plays a significant role in deciding the fate of a match. Something similar happened in Vizag when the dew played the 12th man for West Indies. As the wet ball slipped and skidded all around, West Indies batsmen showed patience and fight to chase down India’s 288 to win the second ODI and level the series 1-1 with a game to spare. (Also Read: Report: India vs West Indies - 2nd ODI, Visakhapatnam, 2013)
Indian skipper, MS Dhoni, who has always considered the dew as a deciding factor in a day-night match, said it gave the team chasing an undue advantage. (Also Read: Stats Highlights: India vs West Indies - 1st ODI, Visakhapatnam, 2013)
“I think it was a very bad toss to lose,” Dhoni said. “We knew there will be some dew at this time of the year but we didn’t know it would start so early. There was plenty of dew right from the first over of the second innings.
“Once the ball went in the outfield, it became so wet that there was no swing for the fast bowlers and nothing for the spinners as well. Later on when they changed the ball, there was glimpse of the kind of turn there was on offer in the wicket, until the new ball too got wet.
“It is a bit unfair when you plan day-night games during this time of the year but it’s a part and parcel of the game and not much can be done about it,” said the Indian captain.
With the selection of India’s squad for the South Africa tour due, conversation invariably veered towards the non-performing star, Yuvraj Singh. Since his comeback to international cricket, the left-handed all-rounder averages a paltry 17 in 16-odd ODIs. Dhoni, however backed him and suggested that Yuvraj has a long rope available.
“We want Yuvi to do well because he can really dominate the bowlers when needed. Yes, he has struggled in the last few games but if you see in the Australia series, he often got out in the first five-six balls that he faced. When you’re under pressure to score runs, you need 10-15 deliveries to settle down which he hasn’t been able to get past. You have to be considerate about it. He is someone who does well when he is confident. After he gets a few runs, you’ll see a different Yuvraj Singh,” Dhoni said.
When asked if there was any particular reason why Yuvraj hasn’t been bowling since the ODI series against Australia, Dhoni denied.
“He will bowl when we need him. Raina is bowling ahead of Yuvraj because I felt he would be a better option since West Indies have quite a few left-handers. We can attack with Ashwin and Raina is the only other off-spinner we have in the side. It’s important who is bowling to whom and how he is bowling. If we need a second left-arm spinner after Jadeja, we have Yuvraj Singh.”
During the series against Australia, Dhoni had suggested that the team is planning to groom Suresh Raina for the No. 4 slot with the 2015 World Cup in mind. However, one ordinary series later, Raina has been shunted back to the No. 5 spot, bringing Yuvraj back to the two-down position. Dhoni said it has been done to facilitate Yuvraj in his attempt to regain form with the bat.
“Yuvi is under bit of pressure and so we decided to give him a series at No. 4, which is his slot as he has batted there for most of his career. We thought until he eases down a bit and feels comfortable again, let’s give him his familiar spot. Also, Raina has done really well at No. 5 and the reason behind promoting him at 4 against Australia was to see if we have a backup option. We don’t have that option,” the skipper said. be used in order to connect your own pap product in your pc.

Pregnancy and Child Health
.
Type 1.
Risk factors
A family history of the diabetes increases risk for next generations.
Diabetes can happen in people of every society, but it’s most common among whites.
Half of type 1 diabetics are under the age of 20. Being age 20 or younger increases the risk.
What causes it?
Most of the children, whose parents are diabetics, do not suffer from this disease, but scientists still believe that heredity plays a big role in Type 1 diabetes because it tends to run in families.Researchers have researched on several genes that appear to increase risk of type 1 diabetes. But they haven’t got a single gene that causes diabetes.
Type 1 diabetes has many hallmarks of an auto-immune condition. In auto-immune diseases, the immune system, this protects from disease by killing invading germs. In the case of type 1 diabetes, the immune system kills the cells in the pancreas that produces insulin.
Type 1 diabetes often occurs shortly after a viral infection, and doctors sometimes notice a sharp jump in type 1 diabetes diagnoses after viral epidemics.
Type 2.
Risk factors
Similar to Type 1, Type 2 disease also runs in families and increase the risk for upcoming generations.
Most of the diagnosed people with type 2 are above of age 30 or older. Half of all new cases lie between age 55 and older.
In comparison of whites and Asians, type 2 diabetes is more commonly found among Native Americans, African-Americans, Latinos, and Hispanics.
Insulin resistance results in increment of weight and decrement of physical activities. Most of the people suffering from type 2 diabetes have sedentary lifestyles and are obese; there weight increases at least 20 percent more than the recommended weight according to their height and build.
Less exercise, especially for those who are overweight, increases the risk for diabetes.
If a female developed gestational diabetes during pregnancy, she is at a higher risk of type 2 diabetes later.
Females who have given birth to babies weighing 9 pounds or more are at an increased risk of Type 2 Diabetes.
What causes it?.
Less weight and good muscles helps the body use insulin more effectively. This is very important to know how much weight we should carry. People whose weight is above their hips have a greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes than those who carry it on their hips..
Gestational
Gestational diabetes affects only to pregnant ladies without any previous history of diabetes. Nearly 137,000 U.S. females develop gestational diabetes each year..
Gestational diabetes and insulin resistance can be prevented by keeping a healthy weight, having healthy food and with the help of regular exercise.
Risk factors
Diabetes problem flows from generation to generation.
Increase in weight, increases insulin resistance.
Native Americans, African-Americans, and people of Hispanic or Latino descent are at increased risk. Whites and Asians have a lower risk.
What causes it?
Hormones may play an important role. Pregnant ladies produce various hormones important for their baby’s growth. However, these hormones may interfere with the mother’s body’s ability to properly use insulin, causing insulin resistance.
Every pregnant lady has some degree of insulin resistance. But if this resistance becomes full-blown gestational diabetes, it usually appears around the 24th week of pregnancy. That’s why all pregnant ladies should be screened for gestational diabetes at that time.

Catherines Character
In the beginning Catherine is introduced to us as high spirited, kind to Heathcliff, and a free spirit. These qualities originally made me like her and her love for Heathcliff. However her character drastically changes throughout the story. When she hurts her leg and is forced to say at the neighboring house, Thrushcross Grange with the Lintons she returns to Wuthering Heights as a dignified, well dressed lady. She was easily swayed to the superior life style of the Lintons, and began to look down upon her old friend and soulmate Heathcliff. She even laughs at Heathcliffs rough and dirty appearance and says! We the reader, are left surprised and cheated with this reversal of Catherine. She becomes more and more selfish by the minute and trys to change Heathcliff, and begins to feel that he is infact beneath her. Which is one of the main reasons she starts to look at Edgar Linton in a new light. For he is a gentleman, refined, handsome and rich. Her feelings for Edgar and Heathcliff become increasingly apparent. However, she claims to be in love with Heathcliff and says that they have the same souls My love for Heathcliff resembles the eternal rocks beneath a source of little visible delight, but necessary. Nelly, I am Heathcliff. Although she is well aware that her love for Heathcliff is bound to change as time passes, she still is obsessed by her love for Heathcliff she confirms it in the above quotation and by saying that she will never, ever be separated from him. Why does she not marry him then? Well, she has another obsession too; she does not want to degrade herself by marrying him. Instead she thinks that by marrying Linton she can and Heathcliff can rise socially. So she goes ahead and accepts Edgars proposal. This quick decision is baffling and hurtful. We can see she is marrying Edgar for all the wrong reasons she even confides to Nelly that he will be rich, and I shall like to be the greatest woman of the neighborhood, and I shall be proud of having such a husband. So when push comes to shrove, she throws away love for he own selfish wants and materialistic motives. Catherine wanted Edgar for his life and riches and Heathcliff for his soul. She didnt want to choose between the two of them, and therefore she never really did. She toyed with both of them by marrying Edgar while still loving Heathcliff. Thus, she caused pain for Heathcliff and Edgar, by causing Edgar to feel jealous and Heathcliff wanting revenge. Catherines passion for Heathcliff ruined the lives of so many people at Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange. The whole story revolved around the passion that Catherine and Heathcliff felt for each other. Edgar, on the other hand, felt a more reasonable love for Catherine. Catherine was devoted to Edgar, yet was in love with Heathcliff! Later in the story when she seems to be suffering with the decisions she has made, I cant say I feel bad for her, because she made those bad choices and now she must live with them. Her relationships were based on impulse and passion, she never thought them out or used her head. I cant help but think of her as a spoiled child who likes to be in the center of attention, by stringing along both men, and wanting to be the most powerful woman of land.

Karen had seen my blog when researching hers (). Her Dad and extended family, Americans, had had to flee St Petersburg (at the time called Leningrad) and the USSR as World War II approached and the bombs fell. Karen is researching and blogging their fascinating stories.
Karen’s Dad travelled the Trans-Siberian railway to Vladivostok (then went via Japan of all places and on to the States). He visited many of the same places I had on this trip, hence Karen’s interest. Her kind comment on my blog coincided with my arrival in St Petersburg so I asked if there was anything special she might like me to photograph. This is how I arrived at little known Serafimovskoje cemetary looking for “Row 31, Grave 11”, Karen’s Uncle Tony.
It was a lovely sunny day and silent. I had Area 31 (which I hoped meant Row 31) to myself, other than a little elderly lady silently scraping and painting a fence around a grave then, it seemed, moving onto the next one. The only sound among the trees and leaves was the crunch of my feet on twigs as I tried in vain to find Tony, twisting myself between grave sites trying to make out a 1940 or an ANTON or… sadly no luck.
My report to Karen and some more photos are in her lovely blog post ‘A Bumblebee Searches for Tony’.
Occasionally a family would pass by on a nearby path to visit their loved ones. This was a living cemetary. I was startled at first to find 2013 graves as well as the older ones, some now no more than mounds covered in twigs and long forgotten, or maybe not forgotten, just belonging to a family far away.
For all the museums I could have visited to learn about the Leningrad Blockade, the priviledge of searching for someone’s actual family member, amidst so many graves, really made the whole thing real for me.
Hitler’s Germany cut off and bombed St Petersburg/Leningrad for 872 days from 8 September 1941 until 27 January 1944 during which over one million people died from the shelling or from starvation. To stay alive, people were eating sawdust bread and, in the end, sometimes each other.
Not to belittle their contribution in anyway, but for comparison, in the whole war USA and UK lost a total of about 700,000 people combined. You can understand why most Russians, taking Stalingrad and other cities into account also, quite adamantly consider that they were the ones that ultimately won WW2.
You cannot imagine how I felt when I awoke this morning and saw this post about your search for my uncle. Although you could not find his exact grave, I want you to know that I am so greatful to you for taking the time from your trip to try to locate it. Looking at your photos is more than I could ever have asked for and just seeing the cemetary which was his final resting place was a wonderful gift. Thank you Bumblebee!

NEW YORK (CNN/Money) -
Common gas-saving tips were put to the test recently by Edmunds.com, CNN.com's automotive content partner.
While most, it turned out, actually did save gas, some of the fuel-saving advice you commonly hear didn't make much difference at all.
Drivers took two different vehicles on the same 56-mile route eight times under various conditions. The vehicles, both Ford Motor Co. products, were a 2005 Ford Mustang GT and a Land Rover LR3 SE. Both have V-8 engines. The Mustang's EPA-estimated mileage is 15 in the city and 25 on the highway while the Land Rover's is 14 in the city and 18 on the highway. In ordinary driving, most vehicles usually get about 15 percent lower gas mileage than EPA estimates indicate.
Drivers are often advised to use cruise control during long highway drives on level roads. The idea is that it prevents "speed creep" -- the tendency to gradually start going faster the longer you drive -- and cuts down on other unnecessary speed changes which can eat up gas.
In Edmunds.com's test, the Land Rover got almost 14 percent better mileage using cruise control set at 70 miles per hour rather than cruising at driver-controlled speeds between 65 and 75 miles per hour.
The Mustang got 4.5 percent better mileage with cruise control.
Verdict: It works
When driving on the highway, most of a vehicle's power is used simply to overcome aerodynamic drag. On the other hand, air conditioning also uses a lot of power.
Drivers are often told that keeping the windows rolled up, which significantly reduces drag, and using air conditioning actually results in better fuel economy than driving at high speeds with the windows open. In fact, CNN/Money has offered the same advice in a story we've run on our site.
In Edmunds.com's test, conducted at a steady 65 miles per hour, "windows down" or "A/C on" made virtually no difference in mileage.
The Mustang got 4.1 percent better mileage -- 30.7 mpg vs. 29.5 mpg -- with the windows down. The Land Rover got 1.6 percent better mileage with the windows down, a difference of just 0.3 miles per gallon.
Basically, the extra fuel used by the air conditioner is made up for in improved aerodynamics at high speeds. Your not really saving any fuel but, at least on the highway, the A/C isn't costing you appreciably either.
Verdict: No difference
You've probably been told before that rushing up to stop lights and racing away from them wastes gas. Turns out it wastes a whole lot of gas, according to Edmunds.com's test.
Slowing zero-to-sixty times to 20 seconds instead of 10 to 15 seconds makes a big difference in mileage over the long term. Braking slowly and gently helps, too.
Driving the Land Rover gently resulted in a 35.4 percent increase in gas mileage while feather-footing the Mustang garnered a 27.1 percent mileage increase.
Verdict: Big difference
Not having enough air in the tires can cause a number of problems, including a potentially dangerous blow-out. But it also reduces gas mileage.
In Edmunds.com's test, the mileage improvement with properly inflated tires, compared to slightly under-inflated ones, was slight but noticeable in the Land Rover but non-existent in the Mustang. Still, for safety's sake, keep enough air in your tires.
Verdict: Small impact on mileage

PENNSYLVANIA (CBSMiami) — A 71-year-old woman from Pennsylvania lost more than 180 pounds in just one day – and how it happened is incredible.
Over the course of 17 years, Mary Clancey’s weight kept creeping up until she was 365 pounds.
“I’d go to the doctors and he would do tests and he’d do tests and everything would be great,” she said.
It wasn’t until she landed in the ER at Lehigh Valley Hospital that doctors discovered she had 140-pound ovarian cyst.
“This is definitely an anomaly,” said Dr. Randolph Wojcik, a plastic surgeon at the Lehigh Valley Health Network. “Initially you can understand where it was missed, when it was a five-pound tumor. It’s a 140-pound tumor, it’s hard to miss in the later stage.”
Surgeons removed the non-malignant tumor, reconstructed her entire abdominal wall and removed another 40 pounds of skin.
“Her just laying on her back flat compromises her breathing… we had to put her on her side and the mass was on another operating table,” Dr. Wojcik said. “The reconstruction was almost like being a tailor.”
Now she needs a tailor!
“Everybody keeps telling me I look great and I look in the mirror and I think I don’t look like myself,” Clancey said.
She’s excited to start a whole new life as half the person she used to be.
Doctors say this case is a good example of why it’s important to always get a second opinion.Wheel of Light - October 2015
Astrology by Rio Olesky
The word aspect, when applied to astrology, refers to a significant angular relationship between two or more planets. Depending on the angle that separates the planets their connection could be blending, harmonious and mutually supportive. Or, it could present challenges that must be addressed. The prime harmonious aspects are 60 degree (sextiles) and 120 degree (trine) connections. They enable situations to remain flowing in a stable way. The main challenging aspects are the 90 degree (square) and 189 degree (opposition) connections. These challenges occur either in our relationship to ourselves (squares) or to others (opposition). There is also a fifth major aspect called a conjunction. This is when two or more planets are very close together. The opportunity, and challenge, of a conjunction is to blend or integrate each of the separate planetary energies into a more focused, flowing unit. If we are successful in that process, conjunctions can help us get a lot done in a short time because we have a lot of energy in the same place at the same time, all doing the same thing. If we don’t affectively blend the energies, each of the planets will tend to do its own thing in its own way and time. This leads either to confusion or dissipation of the energies involved.
This month the most interesting aspect is a conjunction between 3 planets, all in the sign Virgo. In August, this column focused on the transit of Jupiter into Virgo. This represents the principle of expansion (Jupiter) entering a sign that focuses on details, service and health. We discussed how this could lead to anything from feeling overwhelmed by the minutiae of life to learning about ways to maintain or regain good health. We could exaggerate tendencies to be compulsively idealistic and reductively critical of anything or anybody (including ourselves) who fail to life up to that idealized standard. Jupiter in Virgo can also put emphasis on joyful service as well as helping us learn about ways to heal our environment. This month two other planets, Venus and Mars, combine with Jupiter to form a small Stellium, or cluster of planets in one sign.
The Venus-Mars conjunction has also been a topic this year in this space. This is the third time this year that these polar planets have been conjunct. The first one was in February, when they were in Pisces and Aries. In late August and early September, when Venus was retrograde, they were conjunct in Leo. Polar planets rule opposite signs. They also pertain to opposite influences. For example, Venus has to do with affection and sensuality. Mars is more focused on sex. Both are important parts of a relationship, but one is more receptive while the other is more assertive. Conjunctions can be times of blending the separate energies into a larger block. So Venus and Mars provide the opportunity to integrate our feminine and masculine characteristics. We can be aesthetically aware (Venus) even as we feel a drive (Mars) to execute an art project. We can be harmonious and thoughtful (Venus) even as we are self-affirming (Mars) letting others know what our needs and desires are. This is the aspect of the inner marriage in which we have an opportunity to integrate our feminine and masculine selves. This can enable us to realize where we fall on the gender spectrum. We don’t have to be limited to a binary (all male or all female) sense of self. We can find out where we fall within that spectrum. Once discovered and defined we can be more comfortable and authentic sharing ourselves socially and romantically in ways that can lead to successful, fulfilling relationships.
Into this mix comes Jupiter. The conjunction of Jupiter to Mars will essentially last all month, but the peak of influence will be from the 10th-25th. Venus enters the picture toward the end of the month, being conjunct Mars from the 26th-November 9th and Jupiter from 0ct 21st-29th. Keep in mind that neither Venus nor Jupiter are comfortable in Virgo. By nature Virgo is a sign that seeks efficiency in applying analyzed information to practical situations and in serviceful ways. Virgo can be austere, self-contained and focused on process and technique. Venus and Jupiter prefer things to be pleasurable and joyful. It’s not that they can’t function in Virgo. It’s that their nature is not coincident with the focus on hard work and accurate understanding that is the hallmark of Virgo.
If we are off-center at this time, we might find ourselves being fretful and frustrated and the expansive nature of Jupiter constantly reminds us of our imperfection of knowledge or performance. This could be especially true in the area of life (house) that these planets, in the last ten degrees of Virgo, are transiting. We could also overdo any assumptions that we are not attractive or loveable enough. This could be due to physical imperfections or because our clothing style is not in alignment with the fashion police of the day. In a similar but exact opposite manifestation, we could feel a tremendous sense of duty to engage in activities that are designed to save the planet (saving the environment for human habitation is really the issue; the planet itself will be fine). In a relational context, we could try so hard convince someone else of their attractiveness and loveability that the relationship becomes awkward. Finally, watch out for being caustic in communication. Mars (anger) and Jupiter (expansion) can prove volatile and override the natural Venusian tendency to be diplomatic. This could also manifest as passive-aggressive if we smile and pretend all is well as we subtly criticize someone else. This is a good transit to note ways that we project the shadow of our own inadequacies and things we don’t like about ourselves onto others.
In a more centered expression, this conjunction can serve to expand the opportunity to be honest in sharing our social selves with others. What do we offer? What do we need? What behaviors accurately portray our sense of social, sexual and gender identity? Jupiter needs emotional honesty in personal relationships and Venus and Mars are the planets of relationship. Virgo can be refined in its interests, orientation and expression. Venus can aid that tendency and thereby soften some of the Martian tendency to be too contentious.
Conjunctions can be good times for new beginnings. The alignment this month can be a good time to research a project that pertains to work, a new modality of healing or a system within which you can be of service. You could follow this up rather quickly by actually implementing what you are learning. This could also be a good time to bring relationship issues out in the open. Virgo likes to process and refine. We can use this conjunction to initiate a time or methodology through which a relationship could improve over time to the satisfaction of all concerned.
This is a time of year when nature reveals her most radiant colors. Virgo is a sign that appreciates the natural world. Take some time this month to get outdoors. Whether we are putting the garden away for the winter, going on a hike or simply driving around the countryside, this conjunction can impel a new or expanded appreciation of our Mother Planet.
Aries: The triple conjunction this month gives you the opportunity to make progress on the job. It could be in the form of a beginning a new one, or developing new skills in an existing one. Growth can come from being humble in new beginnings and being patient in both learning and applying new tools.
Taurus: The full Moon in Taurus on the 27th provides a unique opportunity to tune in to the higher self. Clarity through dreams, during meditation or artistic inspiration could all manifest at that time. Growth comes by being willing to look deeply within in order to understand yourself better.
Gemini: Challenges or conflicts at work or in personal relationship requires you to be honest in response. Don’t be afraid to confront the problem or the person openly. Exchanging truths with each other can make a significant difference in bringing about necessary changes.
Cancer: The full and new Moon’s will make significant contact with the transpersonal planets this month. This can afford you the opportunity to notice insights and inspirations that can enhance consciousness development. It could also bring changes in behavior and experience dealing with groups and organizations.
Leo: Creativity is strong in both early and late month. In between, there could be power struggles in relationships and unexpected changes and challenges with neighbors or extended family. Growth comes from engaging difficult people with openness, honesty and love.
Virgo: The alignment in Virgo this month can stimulate you to be more self-affirming and assertive than you may usually tend to be. Feelings of confidence can combine with drive, ambition and a powerful sense of physicality that can enable you to be affective and fulfilled in both practical and social matters.
Libra: The new Moon in Libra on the 12th can provide an opportunity to derive deep, useful insights into your feelings. It can also help you change habitual ways of responding to others so that the priority is being emotionally honest rather simply focused on keeping things nice.
Scorpio: This is a good time to work with friends and family to refine both the dynamics and quality of your relationships. Growth comes from being open and honest about what you want and how you feel. Hiding that information could lead to frustration, volatile behaviors and impulsive choices.
Sagittarius: In general the next year could bring opportunities for success in the professional arena. This month is a particularly good time to begin something new, whether a job or simply bringing a new sense of openness and curiosity to the job. Approach these changes in deliberate and methodical ways to avoid overextension and resulting confusion.
Capricorn: You could feel limited this month by either or both of 2 things. One is financial. The other is relationship. In the former, use early month as a time to re-assess needs for assets in the future. In the latter, work with the partner in order to be clear about your respective needs and expectations.
Aquarius: This month can bring perspective about how others perceive you as well as your own sense of uniqueness. Growth comes from working with the feedback from others rather than just detaching from them or responding with aloofness. Listen to the feedback, but consider the source. If you don’t respect the person, why internalize their perspectives?
Pisces: This could be an important month for you in terms of personal relationships. Motivation, confidence, clarity and the ability to be self-affirming and straight forward are qualities that are strongly present. They can enable you to let the other person know who you are as well as working to develop, refine and improve the relationship.

The 2016 champions went into the game needing an unlikely 90-point victory margin to pip St Helens to a semi-final spot, but produced an uninspiring performance to be nilled for the first time this season as tries from Ben Jones-Bishop, Jacob Miller, Sam Williams, Scott Grix and Keegan Hirst - plus six goals from Liam Finn - handed Wakefield a comfortable win.
Trinity's second win of the year over the Warriors enabled them to leapfrog their visitors in the final table and condemn Shaun Wane's men to a sixth-place finish, their worst since 2009.

Buying your first car is a significant milestone in your life, one that you will never forget. After passing your G2 license exam, gearheads that are lucky enough are often graced with a hand-me-down family vehicle, a used car off Kijiji, or maybe even a set of keys to a brand spanking new Honda Civic, Toyota Corolla, or any other entry-level vehicle. And now there’s a newcomer to that segment, the brand new Scion iM.
When Scion announced the arrival of the iM model to North American shores I could not help but notice that the car looked strangely familiar, like a friend you haven’t seen since the third grade. You knew his or her face, but you could never put a name to it. So I pulled out the Toyota yearbook and began searching. Lo and behold, the truth was revealed. The Scion iM is a Toyota Auris in disguise! The exterior shell, inner workings, and chassis all came from its Corolla-derived Japanese hatchback counterpart. No wonder.
This design has been around since 2012 and staying true to Toyota fashion, it shares the same 1.8-litre 2ZR-FAE engine that has been around since 2009. There is a reason why Toyota builds some of the most reliable products on the market, and that’s because they’ve been refining the same platforms for years on end. Not that it’s a bad thing but I couldn’t help but wonder, would this car be ready to compete in 2016 or would it feel a bit long in the tooth?
The Scion iM comes from the side of Toyota that we are not accustomed to seeing. The iM’s ripped-straight-out-of-Japan styling brings back memories of to the Scion xB when it first hit the market by storm in 2004. But instead of the xB’s controversial boxy look and appeal, the iM poses as a conventional hatchback with a factory body kit, a lowered suspension, a polarizing paint job, cool looking wheels, and an interior that looks like it had a bout with an aftermarket tuner shop. This car was clearly developed during the import-tuner craze of The Fast and Furious days, “iM ready for Importfest!”
Yet, I wonder why Toyota did not choose to use a more potent powerplant in the iM. Mated with a 4-cylinder 1.8-litre motor that delivers 137 hp and 126 lb-ft of torque, it takes a lengthy 8.6 seconds to get from 0 to 100 km/h. The power, or the lack of it, was perhaps the most prevalent and disappointing feature of this car. While at low speeds I had to give props for the Scion’s go-kart-like handling, rapid turn-ins, and peppy throttle response, the lack of oomph kept creeping back into reality.
However, fuel economy was ace thanks to the iM’s small engine, Eco Mode, and feathery 1,334 kg curb weight. Over the week I managed an average of 8.3 L/100km – not bad!
There are two transmission options available, a 6-speed manual and a Continuously Variable Transmission ($825), the latter of which was equipped on our tester. Take our advice and skip the CVT. The manual will supplement the otherwise innocuous driving experience with a few doses of driver engagement.
Due to the lowered suspension the car feels quite harsh over rough terrain. As we have seen in other Scions like the FR-S, handling is sporty and captivating, the chassis is brilliant, but as an overall package, it leaves much to be desired. Untapped potential? Perhaps. But there’s certainly no harm in a little extra power.
I liked the simplicity inside the iM: few buttons and a minimalistic design. While it did feel like the infotainment system could have used a few more knobs, the system was decent and includes USB, auxiliary, and Bluetooth capability. The seats were comfortable, though a bit snug in legroom and cargo space.
The Scion iM is entering the most competitive era of hot hatchbacks since the 80s and if it doesn’t come out swinging, it will drown in the competition. As tested, our Barcelona Red iM hangs around $21,990. At this quite attractive price point, I can understand that some sacrifices had to be made, but I feel like a more powerful engine matched with a sportier setup would attract the younger audience that Scion is aiming at.
While the force isn’t particularly strong with the iM, it does have potential. Scion has given customers a blank canvas and like the FR-S, the iM may need a helping hand from aftermarket enthusiasts. Considering the target age and the current incentives for school graduates, the iM makes for an excellent first car. It is very simple to drive and does not have the power to scare the daylights out of any rookie buyers. Though I’d have a hard time recommending the iM, it does make its case with Toyota’s renowned history of quality and reliability.

Read information about the author
Over the next few years 'The Epic', as it became known, grew and grew. Belle drew up a huge family tree and a plan of the house very like Rushbrooke.
Married and a teacher of a class of six-year-olds, she wrote in longhand and, while publishers made encouraging noises, no one was prepared to risk publishing a large book by an unknown author. Eventually the agent Vivienne Schuster was wonderfully enthusiastic about it and found a publisher.
"The Moon in the Water" and its two sequels were published in the UK and the USA with considerable success. Belle gave up teaching in 1985 to spend more time researching and writing. She plans to write a book about Alfred the Great if she can fit it in between looking after the children, dogs, cats and husband.

“You Can Achieve What Your Mind Can Perceive!”Li Yi has collected more than 1,400 model commercial vehicles over the past two decades and built the China Commercial Vehicle Models Museum in Jiading district. [Photo by jiading.gov.cn]
Li Yi, an entrepreneur in Shanghai, has built a museum for his collection of more than 1,400 commercial model vehicles in Jiading district.
Li, 55, adored model cars and trucks since he was a child. While working in a company supplying van hardware, he sometimes received custom-made van models as gifts and has been collecting model commercial vehicles for more than two decades.
"I dreamed of building such a museum since 1996, since I attended auto shows around the world and was fascinated with trucks made in different countries," Li said.
Last August, the private China Commercial Vehicle Models Museum opened to the public. The 2,000-square-meter museum is in a Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) style building with a large lotus pond in front of the house.
Entering the museum, visitors are first faced with a long-head semi-trailer model branded "King" made in the US. Li spent 4,000 yuan purchasing it at a flea market in Japan in 2011. It was made according to the original vehicle with a proportion of 1:14. With batteries, the trailer could run like a real truck, its headlights lit and its diesel engine roared.
"Though it is a model, it has impressive power and torque. It can even withstand the weight of an adult man," Li said.
The major exhibition hall occupies about 200 sq m, with vehicle models in different categories: trailers, fire engines, military vehicles and others. Li said that it is quite difficult to collect truck models, which are normally made in small scale as gifts and seldom sold in the market. In recent years, he regularly went abroad to search for van models in flea markets to add to his collection.
In the museum’s interaction area, visitors can learn how the tower crane, pile driver, concrete pump truck and concrete mixer cooperate to build high-rises. Visitors can also operate fire engines by remote control to finish some basic tasks, such as spraying water on the target.
"I am very happy to show the collection with other auto fans---it is the fans’ fascination that makes the models invaluable," Li said, adding that the museum is also a venue to spread vehicle knowledge to youngsters. More than 500 teenagers have visited the museum since it opened.
Li is planning to enlarge the main exhibition hall to 500 square meters to showcase more models.

Just as this person picks up their fork and knife to cut a piece of stake a flash-bang grenade burst through the families front window. Before anyone has e a chance to realize what happened local police dressed in war ready full military gear kick down the front door. An officer screams “Sit down and shut up!” In 1969 a group that was considered “the greatest threat to the internal security of the country” by J. Edgar Hoover, then Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigations got the shock of their life. Members of the Black Panther Party were the first to experience militarization of police in the form of a SWAT raid. The United States had decided to begin using military style weapons and war tactics on its own citizen. The raid was largely considered a disaster and resulted in the Black Panther Party member being acquitted on the grounds of self-defense. Fast forward to 2014 and this militarization policing has become all too common.
Frequently military style police raids are carried out on local citizens resulting in the wrong doors kicked in and innocent people hurt. Just this May one-year-old Bounkham Phonesavanh had to be placed in a medical induced coma. Using a “no-knock” warrant Police tossed a stun grenade into his play pen as he slept, to gain entry into his family’s home. The raid resulted in no arrest and no drugs were found.
What is perhaps most concerning is the law does not protect from police militarization. It actually empowers it. In the 1980’s president Ronald Reagan introduced a series of anti-drug laws, commonly known as the Military Cooperation with Civilian Law Enforcement Statute. This law was aimed at providing military like training and weapons to domestic police to prevent drug smuggling across U.S. borders. Despite many concerns that this new law violated civil liberties protected under the Bill of Rights, budgets for police militarization have exploded over the years.
SWAT teams carry huge monetary incentives for police departments. Anti-drug laws do not require the destruction of money and property seized during the raids. Instead, confiscated items are used to further gear up against the war on drugs. Three billion dollars a year are allotted to local police for military like equipment such as Lenco BearCats. The Department of Homeland security feels that the bullet proof war tank is necessary for local police units.
Militarized SWAT teams have increased by the thousands over the past few decades despite violent drug related crimes decreasing. As a result of their, at times, reckless expenditures, dozens of stories where average citizens lives are changed forever continue to emerge. Some have challenged the laws and the behavior of local police citing violation of their fourth amendment rights or excessive force. When Bounkham’s mother tried to check on him according to her she was told “sit down and shut up!” That seems to be the court’s attitude toward victims. In the case of 18-year-old Esequiel Hernandez Jr, Marine Cpl., Clemente Banuelos shot him to death as he herded sheep near his home. Cpl. Banuelos was a part of anti-drug border patrol operations. He was acquitted of any charges.
In these cases rarely do local police suffer any type of legal repercussions for treating their local jurisdictions like military war zones. Police often defend their actions. Militarization of local police has become the norm giving them increasing power to kick down your front door. The reason, all too often is to simply serve a search warrant for a misdemeanor crime. Perhaps President Reagan’s Assistant Secretary of Defense, Lawrence Korb, put it best when he said “Soldiers are trained to “vaporize, not Mirandize”

CASE POINT: EXCUSE ME Hum -Ah … MR. POLICE OFFICER – “BUT” ….. So when will the “YOU” start investigating all the prison deaths/murders that have taken place in The Florida For Profit Prison System ????? FOUR IN THE LAST FOUR DAYS – Or is it the Code Of Blue Silence ????
Murder is a capital offense but when those who commit these types of crimes wear the badge of blue silence and are not held accountable by the powers to be – what then Mr. police Officer – what then ?
The police/goons have lost the public’s trust – instead of the friendly concerned police officer we now have a Goon with an agenda. I use to trust in the police, but thanks to the blue pill I tend to view anyone with a badge as a probable criminal. to many goons are rotten to the core it’s best not to take chances. Record everything. Trust nothing they say. Always refuse searches and dialogue with them. record record record – always talk to a lawyer first never trust the police – union thugs are not trustworthyLos Favoritos

It's consistent, it's persistent. Every morning I wake up and the muscles in my biceps and upper arm hurt, sometimes bad enough that Tylenol is my first meal of the day. These muscles hurt because they are getting weaker while I still demand full utility of them. I'm working them too hard.
Up until now my right arm has been spared this annoyance. It might hurt now and again, particularly after a very busy day. I thought this was the case a couple of days ago, when I woke up to discover the same pain, only at a lower level, in my right bicep. Then I woke up yesterday with the same pain, and today with the same pain. It seems a corner has been turned, once again. It seems that both of my arms are now weak enough that they hurt from simple daily usage. I'm getting weaker.
This is no surprise. My arms started showing initial signs of difficulty a couple of years ago. The progression was very slow at first, almost imperceptible. I was really the only one who could see it. When I talked to the neurologist about it, he said he couldn't measure it, but if I felt it, it was probably happening. He also said that my arms would likely go the same way my legs did, with the left side going faster than the right, then both sides, slowly at first then rapidly as I got further into the progression. So far the neurologist has been correct.
These days my arms are barely strong enough to lift my body weight. It's 250 pounds, not insubstantial, but a lift from my wheelchair to transfer into the truck, or onto the toilet, or into bed, has always been possible. My arms, especially my left arm, are approaching the point where that won't work anymore; I won't be able to make the transfer.
Oddly enough in all of this, it is my upper arms losing strength the fastest. My lower arms seem to be doing okay, although it's really hard to tell since they work as a team. My hands still seem fairly strong, except on really bad days. I can still feed myself, open a twist top bottle of beer, fold laundry. Sure, I get tired. That's just ALS. But I am definitely losing my upper body strength fairly quickly these days. It's what happens.Browse a large selection of dining room chairs including metal wood and upholstered chairs in variety colors for your kitchen or area.

Instead of the Samuel Eto'o-Wesley Sneijder-Goran Pandev attacking trio playing behind Diego Milito that had won the Italians the trophy last season, Benitez picked Coutinho, an 18-year-old Brazilian, to play on the left, Jonathan Biabiany on the right, with Sneijder in the middle and Eto'o upfront.
After 10 minutes of the game, Inter were 3-0 up and the visitors a player down after goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes had been sent off. Coutinho was the architect of the first goal, Biabiany induced the foul from Gomes for the second, scored from the penalty-spot by Eto'o, whose one-two set up Dejan Stankovic for the third.
But while Coutinho is already a full Brazil international, Eto'o a three-time African Player of the Year and a triple Champions League winner, and Sneijder one of the favorites to win FIFA's Ballon D'Or prize in January for the world's best player, the surprise star of the night was Biabiany, a 22-year-old French winger whose impact has hardly registered in his homeland.
"Because he is so small [Biabiany is 5-foot-9], he was rejected by the standard training academies and that just shows that French clubs are too influenced by physique," bemoaned France Under-21 coach Erick Mombaerts, who gave him his international debut last year. "He has a huge amount of talent and can do amazing things in small spaces as his feet move so well. He has had to eat mad cow to get where he is now, so he deserves a lot of credit," added the coach, invoking a popular French expression that basically means Biabiany did things the hard way. Most French players graduate through a club's academy and then rise through the hierarchy of Ligue 1 clubs before earning a move abroad.
As often happens to talented youngsters in Italy, Inter loaned out the Frenchman to a succession of clubs: first, when he was 19, Chievo, where a groin injury ruined his chances of any playing-time; then, also in Serie B, he spent 18 months at Modena, the first six mainly as a substitute, and for the next season as a regular with eight goals in 34 starts.
Last season he made the step up to Serie A where, under the watchful eye of coach Francesco Guidolin, he scored six goals in 25 starts from the right-wing in a three-man attack. "The coach had confidence in young players and made me feel very comfortable," said Biabiany, who wore the No. 20 jersey made famous by former heroes Enrico Chiesa and Marco di Vaio. Biabiany scored both goals in a 2-2 away draw at Genoa and a dramatic late winner against Juventus in Round 37, helping Parma finish in a respectable eighth place.
By then, Inter had given Parma 50 percent of Biabiany's transfer rights -- and Luis Jimenez on loan -- in return for signing midfielder Macdonald Mariga on loan in the January transfer window. By the summer, though, the newly-crowned European champions decided to buy both players outright from Parma for a combined €9.5 million ($13.5 million). Parma president Tommaso Ghirahdi and coach Pasquale Marino wanted Biabiany to stay, but they could not turn down that sum. "The club were happy to get the money they wanted in the end," said Parma-based reporter Matteo Genovesi.
Benitez has wasted no time in throwing Biabiany into action this season: he made his first Serie A start for Inter in Round 2 against Udinese and has started the last five games for the team. "This season I'm playing on the wing and I have to defend more, but for me it's great to help my teammates," he said. "The more I play, the more confidence I have and the stronger I feel." Eto'o has also taken him under his wing, recognizing something of himself when he first arrived at Real Madrid, a Francophone in a foreign land, aged 17.
Benitez wants to utilize Biabiany's pace -- he can run 100 meters in 10.5 seconds -- and has told the winger to start sprinting as soon as Wesley Sneijder gets the ball. It was Sneijder whose pass split the Tottenham defense and allowed Biabiany to break clear before Gomes took him down. "That sprint has now become almost automatic for me," said Biabiany.
France coach Laurent Blanc has also taken note, and his assistant Jean-Louis Gasset was at the San Siro to scout Biabiany in that game. French scouts have already missed his talent once, and they can ill afford to make the same mistake again. Inter's scouting system, meanwhile, deserves huge credit for finding this rough diamond -- not that Tottenham defenders, up against Biabiany in the European return game at White Hart Lane on Tuesday, will be so pleased about it.Hey guys, I know I’ve been a little slow to post lately, but I hope to correct this. haha
So I was lucky enough to win this gorgeous little point and shoot over the recent Christmas holidays thanks to Camera House! I was very stoked and have to give a big shout out and thanks to them. Check them out on their Facebook page:
It arrived last Friday after much anticipation from myself and I was eager to go out and give it a shoot, and I thought why not give it a little review while I am at it. After charging the battery I flicked through the menu and had a quick play with settings. It is rather basic but I found by setting it to P mode I could at least set the ISO I wanted myself, rather than rely on the camera. I was also happy to see that in the colour settings other than Fuji Color and Black and white, they had a FujiChrome emulator which I look forward to playing with, this is supposed to emulate their famed slide film colours, I stuck with standard Fuji colour for this test. I also set the camera to center point focus as I find this beneficial to nailing the shots I want. The camera was setup and I was off to run it through it’s paces.
Before I go through my thoughts and shots, I suppose I best list it’s specs:

I went straight to the backyard and snapped this shot of this orange/red flower. Now I know this is not the best shot, however it is a good test of how the camera handles reds and oranges as I find many cameras/lenses struggle with these colours, often over saturating. I found it performed rather well in this department. However it is very touch and go, and could be prone to over saturation.
(this image has been cropped)
The next thing I wanted to test was focus speed. So I grabbed my youngest dog baby doll and got a quick snap of her. The focus seemed fine and snappy. The B&W setting seemed quite nice too.
The center point focus also seemed like the focus point was fine enough to pick up fine objects as the desired point of focus. I did however note that being used to my sony nex’s that it would greatly benefit from a tilt screen, however at around $100 retail. This camera is still quite a steal.
(this is image is cropped)
The zoom does seem quite adequate and is rather quick to zoom to the longer end. It doesn’t seem to lose too much sharpness at the long end either. I was able to snap this shot sitting in a cafe quite a way away from this couple with a dog. The 25-200mm zoom is quite handy and rather good for a camera in this class.
The close focusing distance of 5cm is also very good for a camera in the class and price range and the lens still remains sharp. I feel this could be very good for those that love to play with a little macro work, getting those shots of those little bugs. haha
I did however note that there is some slight barrel distortion. Which will only really be noticed when shooting horizons… or brick walls. But again, quite adequate for a camera in this class.
One thing that did strike me upon editing these pics from the camera (basic contrast and re-size) is how ‘filmic’ the images look due to that great little CCD sensor. This is something you will not find in a CMOS sensor camera as they definitely have more of a digital look too them. I must admit I was looking forward to the possibility of this as I am also an avid film shooter and was definitely not disappointed.
I enjoyed the look so much from this nifty little light point and shoot here are a few more images from my little test walk I took it for:
So after basically putting it through it’s paces, I have to say I am thoroughly impressed with this nifty little point and shoot and can see it accompanying me in my car often when I choose not to bother taking my DSLR’s. About the only thing I could have asked for more out of it was the ability to shoot raw…but then I did not pay for it, I won it thanks to Camera House. haha
All in all this is a very good performing, simple little camera, more than capable of taking some great shots if desired and definitely worth grabbing around the $100 mark if you are looking for a new point and shoot, or like me just a carry around camera when the Mrs tells you to leave the cameras at home. haha
I hope you have enjoyed this little review, till next time, Happy Snapping guys! 🙂Please post your suggestion for a charity that can help Katrina survivors with their long-term needs.

Xander had insisted on tagging along, even though he knew nothing about the city and, for whatever reason, she had agreed to it. She realized now that it was a mistake. She could’ve covered double the ground by now if she didn’t have Xander stumbling behind her. It served to kill any fuzzy feelings she felt about having Xander around and was enough to have her counting the hours until he’d be gone.
“Go home,” she snapped at him.
“You don’t have eyes in back of your head,” Xander said. He stumbled sidewise when one woman, who had obviously mistaken the street for a catwalk, bumped into him.
Buffy bit back the retort that at this point Xander was a hindrance she really didn’t need. Not in the search for Kennedy, and certainly not for her spying mission in Rome. She was so close to getting inside Wolfram & Hart that she didn’t want to blow it. She may be worried about a knife in the back, but she was more terrified that a loose Kennedy and Xander’s curse could flush a year of ‘proving’ her anti-Council street cred right down the toilet. She had worked too hard and had given up too much to get an in with the power center of the glitzy demon underworld in Rome. The fact that she could lose it all in a heartbeat over stupid series of miscommunications was almost too much to take.
However, the memory of Xander’s haggard, desperate look in the car was enough to stop her from going for the jugular. The only thing that kept her sane since she heard about Spike and Angel going down in L.A. was the fact that underneath the Slut-Buffy persona was a Real-Buffy waiting patiently to strike a blow for the good guys. Kicking Xander in the metaphorical balls would be like slapping Real-Buffy across the face.
Her cell rang out with ‘Girls Just Want to Have Fun’ and she yanked it out of the clip attached to her sweats. “Yes!” she barked.
“Unh, Buffy? I found Kennedy.”
Buffy could feel her tense muscles release. “Great! That’s great! Where are you?”
“Unh, she took off on me.”
“What?” Buffy screamed into the phone.
“Buff, people are staring,” Xander said behind her.
“Where are you?” Buffy demanded.
“I’m on Cappellari about a block from Campo De’ Fiori. I think she was heading that way when I last saw her,” Andrew said.
“Crap, crap, crap,” Buffy repeated. Kennedy just had to go trawling for demons in party central. Okay, not a shock that Kennedy was in that area since Buffy picked her apartment specifically because it was so close to party central, but given the crush of people, bars, clubs, restaurants, and cafés, they could search for her all night and still not find her.
Buffy had stupidly assumed that Kennedy would end up in Trastevere, since there were lots of twisty, narrow streets and enough of a nightlife to attract people and demons. Plus, it was in easy walking distance of her apartment. She figured Kennedy would start small since the Slayer didn’t know Rome at all, rather than go for the big game.
Looked like she guessed wrong. What’s more, she should’ve figured Kennedy would head for big hunting grounds. Rome’s eternal nightlife probably had a lot in common with Rio’s permanent party.
“Andrew, get over there right now and start looking,” Buffy barked in the phone.
“She won’t listen to me!” Andrew whined.
“Just find her! If you see her, don’t approach! Just call me. I’ll be there as soon as I can.” Right after I knock out Mr. Deadweight and kick his useless butt into my apartment, Buffy mentally added.
“Going now,” Andrew said. Then his end went dead.
Buff flipped her cell shut, jammed it back into the clip, and turned to Xander. “You are not coming. You are going back to the apartment. You are too tired to help.”
“I’m probably the cause of this,” Xander said angrily. “I have to do something instead just stand there and watch someone get killed. Again.”
Buffy wanted to scream. She did not have time to argue with him. She had a crisis. If Kennedy killed the wrong demon, someone would start backtracking Kennedy’s trail. She couldn’t let that happen.
“I’m done letting you follow me,” Buffy said, barely managing to reign in her desire to throttle Xander. “You’ve got a choice. I leave you here to find your own way back to my apartment, or you can follow me back to my apartment as I run to meet Andrew.”
Xander glared at her with his one eye. He finally shook his head. “Some things never change.”
“What’s that supposed to mean?”
“Well, this is a surprise,” a male voice interrupted.
Buffy felt all the blood drain from her face. Oh, no. My night just got a whole lot worse.
“Does this concern you?” Xander snapped at the man standing behind her.
“Whenever I see a one-eyed brute abusing a dear, dear friend, it most certainly does,” the male voice said.
Xander actually stumbled back a step, as if the owner of the male voice had punched him in the gut.
“Hello, Michael,” Buffy said with resignation as she turned to face the music.
“Buffy, my dear,” Michael released his grip around the waist of his date—Buffy recognized her as an up-and-coming model—and came over to her. He gently placed his hands on either side of her face and kissed her on both her cheeks. As he stepped back, his eyes seemed to be dancing with amusement. “You are looking absolutely radiant this evening.”
Buffy ground her teeth. She knew she looked like crap on a stick. Michael was a master of the complimentary put-down. God knows she’d seen him use this tactic against people he considered beneath him during the two months she spent under his spell. This was the first time he’d done it to her.
Considering who he was, this was a very bad sign. She wished she could blame it on Andrew, Xander, or even Kennedy, but this problem was one she created. Rome may be even more dangerous than she thought.
“I must say, I’m not used to you looking quite so casual,” Michael continued. “I had heard that you had, shall we say, gone more informal since we parted company. It suits you.”
Xander shuffled up next to her so that he could watch her out of the peripheral vision of his one eye. Buffy was surprised Xander didn’t say anything, since he wasn’t exactly Mr. Tongue-in-Pocket. That’s when she realized that Xander could be watching her for clues about how he should respond. It was the first sign she had that Xander actually understood her general situation.
But this situation with Michael was a whole other shameful, embarrassing level.
“Your companion, on the other hand, has impeccable tastes,” Michael continued. “Correct me if I’m wrong, but are those my clothes?”
Buffy winced. She had hoped he wouldn’t notice or would just assume that Xander had a taste for the expensive, custom-made jobs. She should’ve known better. Michael always noticed how someone was dressed. There was no point in lying about the source of the clothes now that Michael had made the comment. He’d just use it against them.
“My friend just came in from…from…elsewhere and his luggage got lost. He’s just borrowing them,” Buffy said. “I keep meaning to ship your things back to you. As soon as my friend leaves, I’ll get Andrew right on that.”
“I’m surprised that your companion is not being treated to one of your famous private dinners,” Michael said.
Xander still remained quiet. If he was surprised that Buffy hadn’t introduced them yet, he didn’t give a sign. Frankly, Buffy was kind of hoping to get out of the conversation with no introductions at all. Her source inside Michael’s compound had told her that he wasn’t keeping tabs on her, but she couldn’t assume her source knew all of Michael’s plans.
“Andrew’s busy and we’re going informal.” Here Buffy threaded an arm around Xander’s forearm. “We were just running to get some pizza and take it back to my apartment.” The minute she said she realized it was exactly the wrong thing to say. It made her sound like a tourist instead of the Roman sophisticate she was supposed to be.
Michael’s mouth made an “ooooh” shape before he turned to his companion, took her hand in his, and gently kissed it. “Go to our usual place. I’ll meet you there. I need to speak to my friend.”
The up-and-coming model gave Buffy a considering look and, with a shrug indicating that she didn’t see Buffy as much of a threat to her claim on her date, she quietly agreed to wait for him there.
Once she was out of earshot, Michael turned on the charm offensive. “Is there a problem I can help you resolve?”
“There’s no problem,” Buffy chirped with Buffybot-like smile.
“I did hear you screaming in your phone, did I not? And your companion, well, he does appear to be deeply unhappy,” Michael said.
Xander tensed next to her. Miracle of miracles, he still stayed quiet. It was enough to make Buffy wonder if someone had ripped out his tongue. Xander was never one for the quiet when babbling could dig him deeper into trouble.
“Andrew,” Buffy said quickly. “Some girl pick-pocketed him on the way home. All my credit cards were in his wallet. So, he found her, then he lost her, but he thinks he knows where she went. So, we’re trying to get to her before she starts spending.”
Michael’s eyes narrowed. “You have not answered my question, I noticed.”
“We have it covered,” Buffy said.
“Even you cannot possibly track a lone pickpocket in Rome. And given that Andrew is your eyewitness,” Michael shrugged, “you cannot be sure you’re tracking the right girl.”
“I don’t need your help.” Buffy said a little too harshly than was comfortable as she willed Michael to just go away so she could catch up with Andrew.
“Seems to me you could cancel your credit cards,” Michael said airily as if Buffy hadn’t spoke.
“There were other items in the wallet,” Buffy said. “Items that I don’t want in the hands of some common thief. Not that she’d know what to do with them.”
“Shouldn’t have given such precious items to Andrew then,” Michel said. “I honestly don’t understand why he remains in your employ.”
“Andrew is the most loyal person I’ve ever known,” Buffy bristled. She ignored Xander’s sudden full-faced look at her.
“Ahhhh, it appears we’ve struck a nerve,” Michael said.
Crap. Now he’s doing the cat-toying thing he does. If we play this game, something’s going to slip, Buffy desperately thought.
“Xander is an old friend. Way older than you,” Buffy said as she clutched Xander’s arm even more tightly.
“Somehow I doubt that,” Michael smirked. “And I was unaware that friends spoke to each other in the manner I just witnessed.”
“That’s why we broke up back in the day,” Xander volunteered.
Buffy plastered a smile on her face. She knew silent-Xander couldn’t last. At least it was a comment she could work with.
Michael changed focus and Buffy mentally prepared. She already knew Michael would consider Xander beneath him. He tended to view anything male beneath him, especially if they were human. And Xander? Painfully human. She might have to knock Xander out because there was no way Xander would keep his temper under the verbal assault.
“Xander, is it?” Michael’s warm smile gave Buffy the shivers. “A most unusual name, but then I hear from your accent you’re American. Unusual names seem to be your nation’s stock in trade.”
“Some of the best people I know have weird names. The people with common names just don’t really stand out, don’t you agree?” Xander asked.
Buffy whipped her head around to look at Xander. Holy crap! Is Xander playing Michael’s game? He’s going to lose!
“We really have to go,” Buffy said as she started tugging on Xander’s arm.
“I have been rude,” Michael said as he thrust forward a hand. “Michael Romano.”
Xander seemed to turn to stone and dig in his heels. If Buffy didn’t know better, she’d think Xander had added 1,000 pounds onto his body weight while she watched.
“Romano,” Xander said lightly. “Like the comedian, right?”
“Romano isn’t an uncommon name,” Michael said just as lightly.
“So, you’re telling me that you’ve got a very, very common name,” Xander grinned.
Buffy’s mouth dropped open. Xander scored a point! Go Xander! Wait! What was she thinking! Michael was just going to come back even stronger and there would be body parts and there would be blood and they still had to find Kennedy and, oh god, she really didn’t have time for this.
Michael turned up the charm and Buffy’s heart turned to ice. “Never be fooled by a book’s cover…Xander is it? Do you spell that with a Z?” Michael asked in a friendly tone.
“Short for Alexander, so it’s an X,” Xander said.
Buffy noticed that Xander’s one eye was glued to Michael, as if he was watching the other man for any suspicious moves. She knew that Xander was looking in vain. Michael wasn’t type to attack them unless someone drew blood, at least not directly. If Xander pissed him off enough though, Michael would make the rest of Xander’s stay very unpleasant. She just hoped it wouldn’t involve a bomb in a bowling ball bag like the last time two “old friends” decided to drop in on her.
“Alexander is a strong name, a man’s name,” Michael said thoughtfully. “Yes, I can see why you’d prefer to go by Xander.”
Buffy felt the urge to cry.
“Perpetual Peter Pan, that would be me,” Xander cheerfully said. Buffy’s head whipped up to look at him as he added, “Besides, Xander strikes me as a way more interesting name. People want to check out my book-y cover when I use it. If I go with Alexander, some idiot’s going to call me Al and I really hate that song.”
“I see,” Michael said thoughtfully. “Pity. Al suits you even more.”
“See? Now I’m thinking you’re trying to pick a fight.” Xander pouted. “You probably have a black belt stashed away and you’re all set to kick my ass. Let’s just consider my ass kicked because I totally want my pizza and I don’t want to have to try chewing it with a broken jaw.”
Michael was so caught off guard that he took a step back and regarded Xander with something akin to surprise. Buffy didn’t blame him. In the kind of circles she and Michael ran in, men, both human and demonic, tended to fight for their honor to the last breath. To simply capitulate and not fight back simply wasn’t done, if only because it ruined Michael’s fun.
After a moment, Michael waved a hand at Xander as if dismissing his presence. “My dear,” he said to Buffy, “if you desire real aid, please let me know. I’m certain I can be more effective than your current,” here he gave Xander an unreadable look, “associates in finding your pickpocket.”
“I will if it comes to that, but we really do have this covered,” Buffy insisted.
Michael’s eyes were once more fixed on an idiotically grinning Xander. “Somehow I doubt that.” He shrugged. “I’ll bid you good evening, then. I hate to leave a lady waiting.”
As Buffy watched Michael turn away, she let out a breath she didn’t realize she was holding.
“We better go,” Xander said in a low voice.
As they began heading for Buffy’s apartment, she admitted in a low voice, “That was close. Thank you. For backing off.”
“Not a problem, especially since he’d only kick my ass one way or the other,” Xander said.
Buffy looked up at him and met the gaze of his one eye.
Xander suddenly looked away and said quietly, “I know who he is. One of his aliases begins with an ‘I.’ Am I right?”
Buffy wilted. “Ahhh. How much do you know?”
“Three of his aliases only. Didn’t know he was actually based in Rome and that you’re mixed up with him, though. That’s news.”
Buffy hoped she imagined the sound of disappointment in Xander’s voice. She wished she could find her own voice to admit that she was disappointed in her enough for the both of them.
“I’m barely able to stand and I’m just slowing you down,” Xander said suddenly. “I better catch some sleep back at your apartment, ’kay?”
Buffy guiltily hunched her shoulders and added a new wish to her list: to erase every evil thought she had about Xander following her around Rome and exchange it for Xander insisting that he help find Kennedy.
“’Kay,” she answered with whisper.Wedding venue – Hurakia Lodge

The Rob Roy is a fine cocktail that almost any liquor cabinet should be able to produce: it asks for little in the way of the exotic and doesn’t even require fresh fruit!

Forgetting that I have a bottle of bourbon, I reached for the scotch instead, the substitution of which yields a Rob Roy.

I realize that using a table is cheating, but I was under the gun to get it completed.
(Sorry for the formatting.)
I needed to figure out how many rows I really needed and if there were an odd amount of rows I needed to make sure that the extra row was added so that I didn’t miss an image. To do this I divided the number of images by 4 (you could use what ever number of columns you want) to get the number of rows. Then rounded up to get the actual number of rows needed. then just iterated through the rows adding in each image to a column.
I realize that using a table is cheating in today’s best practices. This could easily be updated to use css to make it correct. The point of the post is the calculations to make the rows and columns show up.Are you interested in digital marketing?

Answer by Raad Ahmed:
Basically, equity crowdfunding is when individuals pool together usually small amounts of money into a company when the risks are pretty high. The payoff? They own a portion of the company. This type of funding used to be limited to wealthy individuals, but because there are so many crowdfunding platforms popping up, more and more people have the opportunity to invest in a startup and profit from that business if it does well.
If you’re thinking of incorporating crowdfunding, I’d encourage you to weigh the pros and cons.
Pros:
- Your pitch to crowdfunding investors could help fine tune your marketing approach. You will learn right away what works and what doesn’t as far as gaining interest in your business.
- A lot of startups feel like crowdfunding simplifies the investment process. You can simply find a platform that works for you and start attracting investors instead of using time and energy to reach out to investors individually.
- You can have access to money faster. Assuming that you are able to attract investors with your idea, startups usually take about 90 days to get the money that they need from crowdfunding.
Cons:
- Some platforms only release funds to you once you’ve hit a certain monetary goal of investment. This could potentially delay or even derail your financial milestones.
- This approach is usually focused on startups that require less capital (Think 100K or less) so if you’re business requires more, this may not be the best situation for you.
- It’s usually not idea for complex business models. Investors that are associated with crowdfunding usually like simple ideas that don’t require a ton of research or development.
Crowdfunding is definitely changing the game when it comes to startup investment. If you’d like to learn more about crowdfunding or other ways to find investors for your startup, you should talk to a business attorney.
LawTrades can help you find a great startup lawyer. We’ve already helped over 1000 entrepreneurs with their business needs. No matter what phase of development you are at, we can help. Check out our website for more information about our affordable rates and flexible approach.

Not only is he resistant to medications, but he is also very fatal. The new strain of infectious yeast is known as Candida auris, and unlike its cousin Candida albicans, this version has developed a complete resistance to antifungal medications used to combat it. C. auris was first identified in 2009, when he was seen in a patient's hearing loss in Japan. According to an alert from the CDC, health facilities around the world have reported that the fungus was responsible for serious, sometimes fatal infections..
Cortisol in turn, tells your liver to release the sugar it stores for emergencies, which is known as glycogen. So while you sleep, your body is on high alert. Not only do you produce more acetaldehyde, which causes fatigue because your detoxification system is trying to evacuate it, but your adrenal glands are running at high speed and your liver sugar reserves are exhausted. Eventually, the adrenals become fatigued or exhausted and they simply are not able to follow the demands that the body imposes on them..

The cargo ship is intended to dock with the Tiangon-2 orbital space station and conduct the station’s on-orbit refueling
BEIJING, April 20. /TASS/. The first Chinese cargo spacecraft Tianzhou-1 (Heavenly Vessel-1) was launched from the Wenchang spaceport in the southern Hainan province by a Chang Zheng-7 (Long-March-7) carrier rocket on Thursday. The launch was broadcast live by China’s central television.
The cargo ship is intended to dock with the Tiangon-2 orbital space station and conduct the station’s on-orbit refueling.
The Chang Zheng-7 is a new-generation carrier rocket to deliver satellites weighing up to 13.5 tonnes into near-Earth orbit. It was launched for the first time in June last year from the Wenchang space center, marking a new stage in China’s space exploration.

I wanted to add more billows above us, like a canopy bed, but I ran out of fabric - drats! I added a hanging light so we could read in bed, and I sewed together some "book pockets" for the wall, because we don't have room in our little nook for a nightstand.
Franklin has an obsession with the old Nemo in Slumberland comics by Winsor McCay, so I wrapped some mustard colored yarn around some wire and spelled out "slumberland" in cursive. I wanted to dangle great poofy clouds from the ceiling, but I didn't have any poly-fil handy, so I pinned some doilies up, to sort of symbolize clouds? or something. Haha. I really want to get some kind of reclaimed wood headboard now. Wouldn't that look awesome against the fabric?! I think it would look pretty sweet, and it'd cover up all the rough edges of the fabric I was too lazy to deal with, yay!
a few details: 1. Franklin's book-pocket contents: Merlin 2. My book-pocket contents: Redwall (I'm almost finished!) 3. I sewed a pillowcase for Franklin, and screen-printed by hand an illustration I made of Little Nemo's bed. It reads, in French: Sweet dreams, my little Nemo 4. One of the MANY doilies I have leftover from our wedding.
That's pretty much it! Hopefully I can manage to purchase (or make!) the reclaimed wood headboard I see in my head. It'll be a while though. We haven't the means or the money right now. But someday!!

“Smart, innovative people can’t stay away from each other. We’re going to see collaboration going on between Cortex and 39 North to bring forth the next Monsanto.”
-St. Louis County Executive Steve Stenger, 2017
“The destiny of our Planet, the development of its human and material resources, the spread of scientific knowledge, the population explosion and the evolving world community–these are the subjects […] that ultimately will determine Humanity’s future.”
-James S. McDonnell in 1965 from an article he authored titled “Only The United Nations Can”
In its December 2016 report, “Economic Contributions of Missouri Agriculture and Forestry,” the Missouri Department of Agriculture reported that agriculture, forestry and related industries contributed $88.4 billion and 378,000 jobs to the 2016 state economy. For Sheila Sweeney, CEO of the St. Louis Economic Development Partnership and Project Leader of 39 North, these numbers are mind boggling.
“AgTech is St. Louis’ strongest and fastest growing sector,” says Sweeney. “We have an extraordinary pool of talent working in this sector. What we haven’t done is tell that story enough. I don’t want it to be our best kept secret. I want to tell the world ‘if you are in AgTech there is no better place for you than St. Louis.’”
The Making of a Plant Science Innovation District
39 North is a 10-year effort unveiled in December 2016 by St. Louis County Executive Steve Stenger to transform a 600-acre area in Creve Coeur into a new agriculture technology (AgTech) innovation district. The area is already home to Monsanto, the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center, the Helix Center BioTech Incubator and BRDG Park, as well as a number of startups and entrepreneur support organizations. The goal is to leverage and build upon the area’s assets by physically connecting the district.
While the establishment of an AgTech innovation district is a new project, Missouri’s agricultural history dates back to the early 18th century, when French settlers began farming in the Ste. Genevieve area. As early as 1859, when Henry Shaw established the Missouri Botanical Garden, the St. Louis region became a leader in plant science. A statue of Ceres, the Roman goddess of agriculture, was placed atop the Missouri State Capital building dome in Jefferson City when the building was finished in 1917. Throughout the second half of the 19th century, the area along present-day Olive Boulevard–around the future 39 North district–served as a river-to-river Native American high ground pathway with watersheds to the North and South.
As communities developed in the early 20th century, rail lines to Kansas City opened to the North, and in 1930, Lindbergh Boulevard was completed as a bypass of St. Louis. The city of Creve Coeur incorporated in 1949, and post-war construction was residential in nature. Light industrial enterprises attracted to open land and rail lines set up shop. In the mid-1950s, Monsanto started building east of Lindbergh. The 1980s witnessed a shift to a service economy, ushering in the construction of more and more office buildings; in the 1990s, the north part of the 39 North district incorporated into the City of Creve Coeur. This industrial area had very little vegetation or pedestrian-friendly routes.
When the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center broke ground in August of 1999, part of its mission was to shorten the time from discovery to practical application. Following the creation of the Center, its founder Bill Danforth also created the Coalition for Plant and Life Sciences (now BioSTL), a non-profit to assist scientists in getting plant and medical innovations to market. As the Cortex Innovation District in Midtown St. Louis was conceived, built and evolved from 2000-2010, its success leading up to and through the economic crisis of 2008-2009 helped establish St. Louis as a center of innovation and entrepreneurship, laying the groundwork for 39 North.
Mapping the Plan
According to Sam Fiorello, Chief Operating Officer and Senior Vice President for Administration and Finance at The Donald Danforth Plant Science Center, the first physical evidence of 39 North can be traced back to the opening of the first BRDG Park (Bio Research and Development Growth) building in 2009. Adjacent to the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center, BRDG Park offers world-class wet labs, office space for lease and on-site workforce training to post-incubator bioscience startups. In 2012, the St. Louis Economic Development Partnership opened the Helix Center Biotech Incubator, offering similar amenities to BRDG Park but to earlier stage companies. In 2015, the St. Louis Economic Development Partnership won a $500,000 grant from the US Department of Commerce to develop a master plan for 39 North, setting in motion a cohesive effort to build upon the emerging plant science district.
The name 39 North was chosen because the 39th parallel north is the latitude of the physical location of where the district will be in Creve Coeur. The 39th parallel is also the latitude that connects all of the world’s greatest agricultural lands. The master plan defines the district as bordering Old Olive Street Road to the west, Bauer Boulevard to the north, Warson Road to the east, and the southern property line of Monsanto’s Creve Coeur campus to the south. This area intentionally includes the Danforth Plant Science Center, BRDG Park, Monsanto, and the Helix Center Biotech incubator. Project work will add new mixed retail, residential and office spaces connected with cultivated green space to appeal to the lifestyles of highly skilled entrepreneurs and researchers whom the effort hopes to attract to the region.
“The biggest win in year one will be transforming that outdated cloverleaf at Olive and Lindbergh,” says Janet Wilding, Vice President of Major Projects at the St. Louis Economic Development Partnership. “Once that happens, you’ll really see the district take shape. The 39 North plan is a way to connect the dots. It’s unique to have an innovation district that has amenities such as shops, housing and grocery stores already in place.”
The driving force behind 39 North is to grow job opportunities and spur population growth. 39 North planners envision a build-out of 400 residential units, 550,000 square feet of office space, and 85,000 of retail space. The first phase will be to build on and connect existing facilities. For example, a $400,000 grant from the Great Rivers Greenway will fund a greenway connection from Monsanto to the Helix Center. Funding is also being sought for the second phase, which will connect existing mixed use areas adjacent to 39 North and increase visibility of the district along major transportation corridors. The final phase will be to extend improvements north through the district.
Laying the Groundwork: Transportation & Open Space
A primary goal of the project is to connect existing and new roads within and surrounding the district to create a more cohesive, pedestrian and bike-friendly street grid and free up state-maintained highway ramps for local development. The first phase of the project will be to build on and connect existing facilities. For example, a $400,000 grant from Great Rivers Greenway will fund a greenway connection from Monsanto to the Helix Center, with the potential to leverage $1.6 million from the federal government.
Other transportation and open space project components include:
- Redesigning the intersection at Lindbergh and Olive Boulevards to more efficiently handle all traffic patterns. A “folded diamond” design will replace the existing cloverleaf, easing the general traffic flow and removing Old Olive Street from the state-maintained ramp system
- Redeveloping Old Olive Boulevard into a mixed-use, pedestrian friendly street
- Constructing new internal roads over pre-existing abandoned rail spurs, increasing road connectivity within the district, especially North of Helix Center and Danforth Center.
- Building a pedestrian bridge across Olive
- Creating continuous and connecting pedestrian and bike-friendly spaces throughout the district
- Expanding the existing bike path network to allow riders to bike safely and continuously from Clayton and University City to the district
- Connecting anchor institutions in the southern part of the district (Monsanto, Donald Danforth Plant Science Center, Helix Center, BRDG Park) to the light industrial businesses to the north, promoting collaboration and business development.
Building Development
39 North will consist of a combination of residential, office, and retail space driven by the private sector. The building development component of the project will include:
- A mixed-use center located west of Donald Danforth Plant Science Center, featuring office space, a café and residential spaces. This will be the first building project of the master plan.
- The expansion of BRDG Park north of the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center, which includes two new buildings and a parking garage. This project is already underway.
- The eventual transition of light industrial businesses in the northern part of the district to office and lab use to support plant science.
There are also development sites available on the Monsanto campus fronting Olive Boulevard that could enhance the gateways to and pedestrian traffic in the district.
The district’s planners and developers intend to take a sustainable approach to building and environmental systems design, committing to sustainable building practices, air quality improvements, open space creation, storm water management and bicycle and pedestrian connectivity.

Turning a Vision into a Reality
39 North represents the vision of County Executive Steve Stenger. The vision is that we’ll help to leverage our region’s strengths,” says Stenger. “Strengths like AgTech. With the highest concentration of plant science PhDs in the world, globally recognized research institutions, and major corporates players in agriculture like Monsanto and Bunge, it’s just common sense that we would leverage those assets to further benefit the region. Doing so positions St. Louis to attract the attention of innovators in AgTech and related industries.”
“This makes tremendous economic sense for St. Louis County and for the region as a whole,” says Sweeney. “Our strategic plan is comprehensive, and one goal is to increase our population. We have an aging population. As a result, we must attract and retain young people. To compete for talent, we have to leverage our many assets to a younger demographic that wants to live, work, and play in the same space. When I think about 39N and all it offers–walkability, proximity, beautiful space in which to work–the benefits that the plan bestows on our community are difficult to calculate. 39N enhances our region in so many different ways–in terms of economic development, employment, , innovation, entrepreneurship, and global relevance.”
Along with St. Louis County, the St. Louis Economic Development Partnership is working with a long and growing list of collaborators to make 39 North a reality. In addition to institutional partners such as Monsanto, Danforth Plant Science Center, and American Water, the project depends on the collaboration of a number of state and municipal government entities to solve the problems inherent in such an elaborate undertaking. The Partnership is also working with a variety of funding resources—from the US Commerce Department who funded the creation of the Master Plan, to Great Rivers Greenway which will fund a greenway connection from Monsanto’s Creve Coeur headquarters to the Helix Center.
Fiorello has been a major contributor to the project thus far. The Danforth Center is on the governance committee and worked on the grant from the US Department of Commerce to fund the Master Plan.
“The first physical evidence of 39 North is at BRDG Park,” says Fiorello. “The first of three buildings is just about full with home-grown companies, companies from elsewhere in the US and companies from around the world.” The space, which was developed by Wexford Science and Technology, is home to almost a dozen plant and life-science and clean-tech companies such as genomics service provider MOGene, St. Louis Community College’s biotech workforce development and training program, and plant breeding leader KWS.
“39 North initiates and articulates connections—live, work, play—in the community,” says Fiorello. “This is extremely important when attracting talent from all across US and world. It’s even more compelling when you say this is part of this broader initiative–walking paths, green spaces, and connections that will enrich your entire life.”
Venture Café at 39 North, a monthly social and networking event held every Third Tuesday at Danforth Plant Center that launched in early 2017, is designed to encourage dialogue in the district among innovators, scientists, entrepreneurs and the community at large. Patterned after the weekly Venture Café meetups held at the Cortex Innovation Community, the events are open to the public, free of charge, and include complimentary beverages.
Where the Project Stands Now and What’s Next
The entire 39 North master plan project timeline is 10-15 years depending on the availability of federal funding, but there has already been significant progress in the first six months. Since the unveiling of 39 North’s Master Plan late last year, Wilding and the team at The Partnership have been working to secure funding to begin the first major transportation elements of the project. As it stands, the East West Gateway has given preliminary approval to fund the transformation of Olive and Lindbergh. The grant would provide $4M of federal transportation funding, matched with $1M of funding from St. Louis County, for a total project cost of $5M. Construction would begin in 2019 and complete in early 2021.
Other big wins include $400,000 in funding from Great Rivers Greenway to begin planning the greenway spine and St. Louis County funding an overhaul of Old Olive Street Rd., turning it into a bike and pedestrian-friendly town center.
Of the project timeline, Stenger says, “We are way ahead of schedule in terms of establishing Venture Café [at 39 North] to generate interest, and earning the funding from the Great Rivers Greenway to start the greenway effort. It’s not what some people think about government: the wheels are not square. They are round and there is a jet on the back of them.”
One of the most critical, and potentially most challenging aspects of 39 North from a governmental perspective is the reconstruction of the intersection at Lindbergh and Olive. Since the governance of the road will shift from state to local, there are hurdles to overcome to make sure that transition goes smoothly. Those conversations are already underway and going according to plan.
Sweeney says, “When the interchange at Lindbergh and Olive is redone, it will create great open space and the ability to utilize that property for some new buildings. It will be significant and monumental. We have businesses interested in looking at those already, which is sooner than we anticipated.
“By planning over 10 years, we have multiple opportunities to fully realize our vision for St. Louis to be the epicenter of AgTech in the United States,” says County Executive Stenger. “This is a big vision that is leveraging one of our region’s biggest traditions – agriculture. We’re focused on ensuring that tradition remains an economic driver of our region well beyond the 21st Century, and the vehicle driving that vision is 39N. This is an incredible opportunity for St. Louis to really own its future.”Plagiarism was “not an intentional act,” says first author of retracted TB paper
A 2013 review article about tuberculosis is being retracted for “unacknowledged re-use of significant portions of text” from another article, which the first author said wasn’t intentional.
Sayantan Ray, based at Medical College and Hospital, Kolkata in India, told us that “most of the unchanged text” is present in sections written by junior co-authors. Since there doesn’t appear to be any attempt to cover it up, he argued anyone responsible for the plagiarism must not have realized it was wrong:
You can appreciate that this type of obvious similarity can only happen when the concerned person [does] not have any idea about [the] plagiarism issue.
According to the notice, published by Therapeutics and Clinical Risk Management, most of the re-used text appears to have come from a 2012 paper in the Indian Journal of Medical Research. Here’s more from the notice:
The editor of the Indian Journal of Medical Research has brought to our attention the unacknowledged re-use of significant portions of text in the above article. The source of much of the text appears to be from:
Sharma SK, Mohan A, Sharma A. Challenges in the diagnosis and treatment of miliary tuberculosis. Indian J Med Res. 135, May 2012, pp 703–730.
Dr Ray comments thus:
“Regarding the similarities found we want to clarify that this apparent plagiarism is not an intentional act and likely to be factual error. In any way, we do not want to undermine scientific pursuit or vitiate the investigational spirit of hard work and creativity. Please be informed that the different portions of the review were written by different co-authors and most of them were postgraduate students at that time. It seems that they have taken materials/ideas from previously published source unaware of the issues of plagiarism.”
The paper, “Diagnosis and management of miliary tuberculosis: current state and future perspectives,” discussed the epidemiological and clinical aspects of miliary tuberculosis.
When asked for more details on the retraction, including how his co-authors were “unaware of the issues of plagiarism,” Ray said:
Although anticipated but didn’t receive any intimation from the journal/publisher regarding retraction of our article. Indeed, we are very much disappointed by this decision. However, when Dovepress contacted me a month back regarding this issue, I replied that if this article is anyway going to hamper the prominent scholarly repute of the Therapeutics and Clinical Risk Management, they can retract it from the journal.
In my response to Dovepress, it was mentioned that we did not have any plagiarism checking software like ithenticate at our institution during writing of this manuscript in 2012. Therefore, we could not check the manuscript for possible plagiarism before submission.
Because there is no attempt to modify the plagiarized text, Ray argued, it had to have been unintentional:
Contributors of this article had taken portions unchanged from the IJMR article published in 2012. You can appreciate that this type of obvious similarity can only happen when the concerned person do not have any idea about plagiarism issue.The article by Sharma et al. was published when we were preparing the manuscript. Since close similarity was there between the topics, possibly contributors of our article were much influenced and tempted to take ideas from it. Unfortunately, despite citing references against those portions taken from the IJMR article, we failed to duly acknowledge the original source.
Lastly, I want to emphasize that we intended to produce a good review article on that very important topic. We worked hard to make it informative and useful for the readers across the discipline.This review received many citations over last 2 yrs as well. However, in order not to vitiate the investigational spirit of hard work and creativity, I think the decision of retraction from Journal of Therapeutics and Clinical Risk Management is justified.
The article has been cited six times, according to Thomson Scientific’s Web of Knowledge.
Ray said that most of the text that was directly copied from the 2012 paper was contributed by junior co-authors:
My job was to provide a concept and design for the review along with literature search. Of course I wrote few sections of this article as well. Apart from the abstract the sections on treatment, Indian perspective and conclusions were written by me.You will see that in the sections on pathogenesis, clinical presentation and diagnosis, most of the unchanged text from the IJMR article are present. Actually, those sections were written by our junior co-authors (I do not want to put their names since it was a joint responsibility) who were postgraduate trainee at that time. We should have been more cautious regarding checking those contents but failed to detect the unchanged copied portions.
IJMR’s editor-in-chief Anju Sharma told us:
We came to know about this duplication when the authors of this review article published in the IJMR complained to us. We immediately informed the editor of Ther Clin Risk Mngmt.
When contacted for more details, the editor-in-chief of Therapeutics & Clinical Risk Management, Garry Walsh, directed questions to Tim Hill of Dove Medical Press, the journal’s publisher.
Hill said that Ray responded with an “an outright admission.” He also said that “submissions require that all authors agree that what they have submitted to us for consideration is unique and unpublished elsewhere.” He added that the article was published before the journal started using iThenticate to check for plagiarism, “and also conduct a number of other checks prior to papers going to first peer-review.”
We’ve also reached out to the corresponding author of the 2012 paper, Surendra Sharma; we’ll update.
The list of retracted papers or papers with errata, corrigenda or expressions of concern that appear below the retraction notice for this paper, is impressive:
No the list has nothing to do to these authors I guess. A wrong search data displayed perhaps.
Ah, the oft-used “But, I didn’t know I couldn’t do that” defense.
Is this standard? As first author, it was my job to write ALL of the article – every single word.
The order of authors can be quite a contentious issue! It can be based on a whole range of considerations, but ultimately comes down to an agreement between the authors. In my experience, it’s common for different authors to write different sections of the paper. The order doesn’t necessarily reflect who wrote the bulk of the paper.
Here are some examples of how author order was determined from my own publication list: the most senior author is listed last (to denote seniority), alphabetical order by surname, first author is primary data collector or study designer, alternating author order where there are multiple papers from the same project. I’ve never flipped a coin or rolled a dice, but I’m sure others have!
Well, if the students who plagiarized did so “unaware of the issues of plagiarism”, then the senior author cannot hide behind “joint responsibility”.
Either the students were aware and consequently jointly responsible for the plagiarism, or they were never informed about the concept of plagiarism, in which case the senior author must take full responsibility. You cannot have it both ways.
The COPE guidelines (and journal policies) seem to say that all authors are responsible. The supervisor / student relationship isn’t specifically mentioned in the COPE guidelines (that I can see). Universities may have policies that deal with the supervisor / student relationship though.
Hi.
Have just looked at this, so I may be missing details (apologies in advance) but I’m writing to ask about a discrepancy: on PMC, this article shows up as “corrected” while the dovepress website says retracted. Does this sort of thing happen frequently? Haven’t checked other indexes either.Quick hitters from USC’s Saturday practice:
* Freshman Adoree’ Jackson, who has been out becuase of a foot injury, was a full participant, returning kicks and working with the second-team defense at cornerback.
* More good news on the injury front: Defensive end Leonard Williams was back in pads for the first time since hurting his left shoulder. Williams wasn’t a full participant, but he’s close. He might play in Monday night’s full-pads scrimmage.
* Nose tackle Antwaun Woods is making good progress with his hyperextended elbow. He participated in the walk-through portion of the practice.
* Tailback Justin Davis, rush linebacker J.R. Tavai and guard Damien Mama suffered sprained ankles.
* Su’a Cravens again spent considerable time working as a “nickel Sam” when USC used a nickel defense.
* Nathan Guertler got more reps with the first team at right tackle, rotating with Zach Banner.
* Cornerback Chris Hawkins continued his strong training camp with an interception of Cody Kessler.
* Receiver George Farmer made a diving catch on a Max Browne pass for a touchdown.Basch profile

The results of surgical treatment of migrated IUDs in the pelvic cavity are summarized in 17 women. The average age of the patients was 33,2±3,4 years. The timing of implantation of the IUDs varied from 10 days to 24 months. In all cases, the intra operational finding was T-shaped a copper device.
The reason behind the women's consultation was an increase in pain syndrome in the lesser pelvis (n=15), dysuric phenomenon (n=1) and the onset of pregnancy (n=1). Perforation of the uterus and migration of the spiral occurred from 10 days to 2 years after its implantation. All patients were operated laparoscopicaly.
The average duration of operations was 45,5±10,5 minutes. In the postoperative period there were no complications from the pelvic organs and postoperative wounds. The period of hospitalization of patients was 3,5±0,7 days. In all cases there was a regression of clinical signs and recovery. In one pregnant patient (gestation period 5-6 weeks) the pregnancy proceeded without particular pathological abnormalities and resulted in the birth of a full-term child.
Laparoscopic removal of the IUD migrating from the uterine cavity to the abdominal cavity is the method of choice in the treatment of this group of patients, avoiding development of intra- and postoperative complications and a shorter length of stay in the hospital. The effectiveness of the procedure reaches 100%. The most common cause of complication of the IUD is the perforation of the uterus during its implantation.
Keywords
Use of intrauterine devices (IUDs) is one of the most widespread and effective methods of contraception. About 10% of females in industrial countries and 16,5% of females in developing countries resort to IUD to prevent unintended pregnancy [1].
The main reasons for a wide spread of the given method of contraception are possibility for a long-term use, absence of potential harm to an organism, return to fertile state after removal of IUD, simplicity of insertion and a relatively low cost [1-3].
However, in 1,3-1,6/1000 cases IUD may migrate into the free abdominal cavity and into the cavity of small pelvis, as well as into the urinary bladder or sigmoid colon with formation of vesicouterine or intestinouterine fistulas [1, 4-6]. The cause of movement of IUD out of uterus is considered to be perforation of the uterus during IUD insertion which may remain undiagnosed for a long time. The device may also migrate under the endometrium or into the myometrium with frequent development of inflammatory processes and pelvalgia [1, 6].
The aim of the given report is demonstration of the authors’ experience in surgical treatment of female patients with IUD migrated into the abdominal cavity.
Materials and Methods
In the given work experience of surgical treatment of 17 female patients with migration of IUD into the abdominal cavity (2006-2015) in the endosurgery department of Republican Scientific Center of Cardiovascular Surgery is analyzed. The average age of patients was 33,2±3,4 years. Duration of the period after insertion varied from 10 days to 24 months. In all cases at operation T-shaped copper device was found. The last delivery date before insertion varied from 67 to 215 days. Fifteen patients (88,2%) had three deliveries in history, two patients had four deliveries, all were vaginal deliveries. Two patients had legal abortions in history, two patients had past adnexitis treated by conservative method. One patient had a history of operation for acute appendicitis.
Topical diagnosis of IUD migration was performed using ultrasound examination and plain radiography of pelvis and abdominal cavity.
All data obtained in the investigation were subject to statistical processing with determination of the average meaning (M) and of root-mean-square error (m).
Results and Discussion
All female patients were directed to the hospital by a gynecologist doctor. It should be noted that 12 patients had not referred to gynecologist after insertion and had not been observed, and IUD location had not been controlled. The reason for referral of these patients to women’s consultation was intensification of pain syndrome in the small pelvis (n=15) hardly removed by spasmolytics, dysuric disorder (n=1) and pregnancy (n=1). Patients referred to a doctor with signs of IUD dislocation out of the uterus in 10 to 24 months after «implantation». Study of history, collective discussion with gynecologists who had inserted the IUD, analysis of the operation finding confirmed the cause for dislocation of the device into the abdominal cavity in 15 patients being perforation of the uterus. So, six patients were delivered by gynecologists in 10 days to 1 month after «implantation» with pain syndrome persisting from the day of the procedure, and with signs of irritation of the peritoneum in the lower abdomen.
The rest of the patients noted abnormal state of health soon after IUD «implantation» and received treatment with a short-term effect. 12 Patients completely ignored control examination after «implantation» and only enhancement of pain syndrome made them visit a doctor in the period from 6 months to 2 years.
The main diagnostic method that permitted to identify perforation of uterine wall and migration of IUD was ultrasound examination which located IUD in the region of the right uterine adnexa (on the right border of uterus) in 8 patients, in the region of the left uterine adnexa (on the left border of uterus) in 4, in the orifice of the left uterine tube in 2 and in the region of the front wall of the uterine body in 3 patients. IUD was visualized in ultrasound examination as a hyperechoic relatively long formation with acoustic shadows (figs. 1, 2).

In 10 cases plain radiography of the abdominal cavity and pelvis (figs. 3, 4) was performed which confirmed dislocation of IUD out of the cavity of small pelvis.

Use of two methods of topical diagnosis was justified by a necessity to reach a more definite diagnosis. All patients were operated by a method of laparoscopy (figs. 4, 5).

Operations were performed with three access ports. In all cases an adhesive process with different extent of evidence was noted in the small pelvis. In 5 patients IUD was removed from the cavity of the formed abscess on the right border of uterus. In case of frontal localization of IUD ultrasound examination visualized an evident adhesive process in the anterior culdesuc, after dissection of adhesions the IUD was identified and extracted.
In two cases IUD was removed from the lumen of the left uterine tube.
Some peculiarities of removal of IUD should be mentioned. If in revision of the small pelvis parts of IUD were visible, IUD was removed with minimal dissection of surrounding adhesions. In the opposite situation, at first a search for IUD was made on the basis of ultrasound examination data with cautious dissection of adhesions and instrumental palpation of this zone. In case of formation of abscess it was opened and aspirated, and after removal of IUD the cavity was opened for adequate emptying. In all cases the volume of adhesiolysis was selected individually. A search for a perforation hole in the uterus is not recommended by us.
The cavity of small pelvis was drained within 1-2 days, and in case of abscess – 4-6 days. Antibiotics were administered only in case of abscesses and signs of inflammation. No intra- and postoperative complications were observed. The operation lasted from 35 to 70 minutes, on average 45,5±10,5 min. Duration of the operation was determined by dissection of the formed adhesions, localization and removal of the IUD and in one case by pregnancy. Patients were discharged on the 2nd and 6th day, with average hospitalization period 3,5±0,7 days.
All patients were discharged without complications for further observation by gynecologist and surgeon. In a pregnant female patient (gestation 5-6 weeks) pregnancy proceeded without any special pathological abnormalities and ended in birth of a full-term child.
After perforation of uterine wall an intrauterine device in most cases migrates into the small pelvis. Such complications are associated with pelvalgias, intestinal obstruction, bleeding, peritonitis and local abscesses [6]. In some cases the first manifestation suggestive of IUD migration is the onset of pregnancy [7, 8] that was also noted in one of our observations.
According to some authors, migration of IUD into the abdominal cavity and small pelvis occurs in patients with a local aceptic inflammation of the uterine wall and development of its decubitus that finally leads to perforation [3, 9]. Besides, perforation may result from traumatizing the uterine wall by a coarse manipulation during IUD implantation, or from a uterine pathology (bicornuate uterus, small uterine fundus) [9, 10]. One of the known causes of perforation of the uterine wall and IUD migration is believed to be a low level of estrogen in the period of lactation and in the nearest postpartum period with the related dystrophic changes in the uterine wall leading to the given complication [1, 5, 7]. In the presented series of observations it should be noted that all patients had at least two deliveries in history, two cases of abortions, and inflammatory diseases of adnexa in two observations. However, these observations are too scarce to make any reliable conclusions about risk factors.
The main diagnostic method for IUD migration is ultrasound examination that permits to obtain necessary information about the condition of uterus, localization of the device and presence of complications. In more complicated clinical cases CT scanning and MRI are used that possess the highest diagnostic accuracy.
According to WHO recommendations, all migrated IUD are to be removed by laparoscopic techniques or by laparotomy, the choice depending on the presence of complications [12]. In the absence of any serious complications IUDs are extracted mainly by laparoscopic method. In case of intestinal fistulas, peritonitis, bleedings abscesses and coarse scarring processes, IUD is removed from laparotomy access [2, 3, 5, 6].
In Table 1 complication rates of laparoscopic techniques and laparotomy are given according to the literature data.
Table 1. Rate of Postoperative Complications
As is seen from the table, one of the main methods for removal of IUD out of the abdominal cavity is laparoscopy. Here, the rate of postoperative complications with different operation techniques is from 0 to 38%. Of 17 observations presented by us not in a single observation any intra- and postoperative complications were noted.
According to K. Ertopcu et al (2015), in 18 (50%) patients frequency of conversion with laparoscopic techniques was 22%, and with minilaparotomy – 6% which was associated with emerged bleeding (n=1) and with difficulties of visualization of IUD (n=5) [5]. However, the authors did not note any statistically reliable difference in the rate of postoperative complications vs. selected operational method and access.
Le A. Shan et al (2016) and A. Madena et al (2016) successfully used laparoscopy in combination with cystoscopy or rectoscopy in treatment for uterovesical and uterointestinal fistulas [14, 15].
According to the data of United Nations Development Program, pregnancy with use of intrauterine contraception occurs in 1-2 of 100 women per year [11]. The onset of pregnancy with the IUD has negative consequences both for fetus (low weight at birth) and for female’s organism (preterm deliveries, chorioamnionitis, spontaneous abortion) [7, 8].
In our investigation pregnancy occurred only in one patient, the gestation period was 5-6 weeks. In this case we managed to successfully remove IUD with preservation of pregnancy which further proceeded normally without significant pathologies and ended in birth of a living full-term infant.
Conclusion
Laparoscopic removal of intrauterine devices migrated into the abdominal cavity is a method of choice in treatment of the given group of female patients permitting to avoid intra- and postoperative complications and to reduce duration of stay in hospital. The effectiveness of the procedure reaches 100%. The most common cause of migration of intrauterine devices into the abdominal cavity is considered by us to be perforation of uterus during implantation of the device.

This last week it was Portland, and we’ve had some fun here! Columbia River RV Park is very nice (other than the jets taking off from PDX) and the people here are really friendly and helpful. Everyone has a favorite thing to do / place to see, and we just don’t have enough time to take it all in! Portland is probably the coolest place we’ve been to so far (other than San Francisco, of course, but it’s different – Portland is really laid back, which fits us better than SF’s entrepreneurial / everyone’s involved in a start-up / check out my clothes and don’t you dare park there kind of attitude). Here’s a sample of what we’ve done while in the City of Roses –
First off, Mt Hood – totally awesome – we rode the lift, had a drink in the Blue Ox Bar, and generally just bummed around for a while looking at views…we talked to a couple of ‘boarders while we were there, and, expecting Spicolli from Fast Times at Ridgemont High, I was pleasantly surprised at how polite and knowledgeable they were – refreshing! Pics from Mt Hood –
- First glimpse of Mt Hood from the road in.
- A little closer…a little bit bigger!
- My version of Mt Hood
- Entering the ski lodge at Timberline.
- Now THAT’s a ski area…
- The Timberline Lodge – hotel built by the WPA – amazing!
- View of Mt Jefferson – a sister peak.
- Skiing and Snowboarding in August? Yessss…
- A look at the peak from the “Magic Mile” ski lift drop off.
- Carol taking her pictures at Magic Mile.
- Cold, but not that cold…
- Huh?
- The entry door (from the inside, of course) to the Blue Ox Bar.
- Waterfall along the road to the Timberline Lodge.
- George Mitchell (on the left) and Dan Pressley taking a break at their concert on the Tualitin Commons.
The last picture in that group, George and Dan, were two guys I met while playing golf at Rose City Golf Club in Portland. George has played keyboards for 30 years for another person with the initials “DR” (hint: she used to be associated with The Supremes), and Dan and he were playing a free concert on the Commons at Tualitin (a little town just south of Portland) as part of their Summer of Jazz Festival, so after Mt Hood, Carol and I stopped in and listened to some of their concert. Very cool.
Next, we were off to “The Dalles”, a trip along the Columbia River Gorge…lots of waterfalls…and kite surfing on the river – cool area, but not really what we were expecting. I expected a “gorge”, you know, something like 300 feet of canyon wall with the river at the bottom and scenery galore, but really, the road just meandered up the side of the Columbia River, which was scenic and all, but just not Wow! – if you know what I mean. Here are some pictures from that day – there were some cool waterfalls along the side of the Old Columbia River Highway –
- One of the many houseboat communities on the Columbia.
- Columbia River Gorge
- Cool rock formation on the Gorge.
- Paddle Wheeler tour boat – for real.
- One of the many fires in Oregon.
- Looking down on the road from the viewpoint – Lucky?
- Firefighters interacting with little boy – very cool.
- Another view of the fire from lower in the canyon.
- Sailboats on the Columbia River.
- One of the many waterfalls on Old Hwy 30.
- Pretty nice.
- Old fat fart on the side of the road taking a picture.
And then a trip to Tillamook to see the cheese factory, and Astoria, the farthest Lewis and Clark traveled on their discovery journey. We decided to get a Tillamook Ice Cream cone at the factory, but it was like a 45 minute wait! We ended up going down the road a bit to Rockaway Beach and buying one there – no line – same Ice Cream! Beautiful coastline between Tillamook and Astoria (named after John Jacob Astor, railroad tycoon) and we took our share of pictures along the way. We stopped at the commemorative Astoria Tower, but opted not to climb to the top – the view from there (even from the bottom of the tower) was fantastic! Some pics from that leg of the journey –
- Netarts, OR – unusual way to mark a park entrance.
- The Tillamook factory – in a word – crowded!
- Apparently this is Duck Country…
- Another cafe that must belong to Wanda.
- Don’t know why Carol took this picture.
- Oregon Coast outside of Tillamook on our way to Astoria.
- Another coastal scene.
- Commemorative Tower in Astoria.
- It has the story of the West engraved on the outside of the Tower.
While we were in the Portland area, we were able to meet up with Gary Cunningham. It’s been a long time since we’ve seen Gary (his first comment to me was how gray I’ve gotten) and it was really great catching up with he and his fiance’ Karin (hope I spelled that right). They moved up to the Portland (actually Vancouver WA) area a few months ago and are very happy with their new home. I don’t blame them a bit – so much to do and the weather (at least in the summer) is fantastic!
Be sure to catch the next couple of blogs! There is some real adventure coming up – believe you me!

The coastline is absolutely gorgeous!!! Nice shots of the river and Mt. Hood as well 🙂
It was great seeing you guys!! And reading about your adventures, glad you guys are so willing to share in the ups and downs of such a journey! I can’t wait to see the posts from the NE Fall tour and everything else!

As is often the case, I've got a nagging feeling that people are making a mistake by doing so, and that they'll regret it later.
Nevertheless, I thought I'd take the opportunity myself to do a little bit of digging and research about Iran, since I'll readily admit that I know little to nothing about Iran generally (except its politics), or Tehran specifically. But this is really cool-looking, and not at all what I expected.
It seems that Iran has a fairly vibrant skiing scene, which really doesn't jive with my preconceptions of the country. Shows what I know, huh?
(h/t Paul Kedrosky)It is the hottest day in September, and I’m heading toward the sea. Spring roses and strawberries have come and gone, their sweetness only remembered by this grainy photo of strawberry-rose syrup.
I woke up this morning and went to go put on my memories, but they were all in the washing machine and there was nothing to wear. With each churn of the machine, the colors bled and turned to grey.
This May tabbouleh was made with beets, pistachios, and feta. I put wildflowers in a Coke can as the sun turned black in the mid-afternoon.
There was a season of spicy arugula and discovery.
We pan-fried gnocchi, panned for gold, and planned a small town life.
The colors of summer have passed, and even tomatoes are fading now, which I never had a chance with.
The heightened fire of spirit that thrives on a beautiful mixture of confidence and naiveté fades gracelessly into a phlegmatic fall of greys and age.
The summer is gone; the swamp is back.
while I’m not happy about summer being gone, i am glad to hear: “the swamp is back.”
this is beautiful and funny. and that first photo is wonderful.
three cheers for return of the “swamp”. Looking forward to some yummy concoctions for the fall season!
it is a bright and beautiful and oppressively warm thursday in september, my dear pilgrims. let us praise the gods for our claire and her unconquerable soul, again and infinitely. thanks for this epilogue, clam. viva la swamppppp
I just about jumped for joy when I found that one of the links on this post was a song by Billie Holiday. Truly you are a most beautiful person.

I am better because of the swamp.A Palestinian gunman entered the library of a rabbinical seminary and opened fire on a crowded nighttime study session Thursday, killing eight people before he was shot dead, police and rescue workers said. It was the first major, spraying dozens of bullets. Rosenfeld said at least six empty bullet clips were found on the floor.
Rescue workers said nine people were wounded, three seriously.
"Tonight's massacre in Jerusalem is a defining moment," Israel government spokesman Mark Regev told The Associated Press. "It is clear that those people celebrating this bloodshed have shown themselves to be not only the enemies of Israel but of all of humanity."
U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and the moderate Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, condemned the attack. But Regev said the Palestinians must go further and take steps against extremists..
One of the students, Yitzhak Dadon, said he shot the attacker twice in the head, neutralizing him before a soldier killed the man with an automatic rifle. "I laid on the roof of the study hall, cocked my gun and waited for him. He came out of the library spraying automatic fire," he said. sobbed uncontrollably.
The seminar is the Mercaz Harav yeshiva in the Kiryat Moshe quarter at the entrance to Jerusalem, a prestigious center of Jewish studies identified with the leadership of the Jewish settlement movement in the West Bank. The seminary, founded by the late Rabbi Tzvi Yehuda Hacohen Kook, the movement's spiritual founder, serves some 400 high school students and young Israeli soldiers, and many of them carry arms.
"It's very sad tonight in Jerusalem," Mayor Uri Lupolianski told Channel 2 TV. "Many people were killed in the heart of Jerusalem."
In Beirut, Lebanon, Hezbollah's Manar satellite television station said a previously unknown group called the Martyrs of Imad Mughniyeh and Gaza was responsible for the attack. The claim could not immediately be verified. Mughniyeh, a Hezbollah terror mastermind, was killed in a car bomb in Syria last month. Hezbollah has blamed Israel for the assassination, and Israel has been fearing a revenge attack.
In Gaza, Hamas stopped just short of claiming responsibility. "We bless the (Jerusalem) operation. It will not be the last," the group said in a statement sent to reporters by text message.
In mosques in Gaza City and the northern Gaza Strip, many residents gave prayers of thanksgiving - only recited in cases of great victory.
In Jebaliya, about 7,000 Gazans of different factions marched in the streets, firing in the air in celebration, and visited homes of those killed and wounded in the last incursion. In the southern town of Rafah, residents distributed sweets to moving cars, and militants fired mortars in celebration.
The attack came a day after Rice persuaded Abbas to return to peace talks with Israel. Abbas briefly suspended talks to protest an Israeli offensive in Gaza that killed more than 120 Palestinians.
At his West Bank headquarters, Abbas harshly criticized the attack. "The president condemned all attacks that target civilians, whether they are Palestinian or Israeli."
In Washington, Rice said she called Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni to express condolences. "The United States condemns tonight's act of terror and depravity," the statement said. "This barbarous act has no place among civilized peoples and shocks the conscience of all peace loving nations. There is no cause that could ever justify this action."
Israel's Foreign Ministry issued a statement condemning.
The attack came on the same day as Thursday that Israel is open to the idea of letting guards from Abbas' moderate Fatah movement oversee Gaza's borders - one of the main tenets of the truce idea. But the Israeli spoke before the shooting, and it was not immediately known whether the Israeli Th.
This was the first serious attack by Palestinian militants in Jerusalem since a suicide bomber killed eight people on Feb. 22, 2004. There have been several attacks since then, and police and the military say they have foiled many other attempts.

The Flagler Museum will exhibit Parks, Palaces, and Public Buildings: Richard Morris Hunt and American Architecture from October 14, 2008 through January 4, 2009. The exhibition of approximately 80 drawings, watercolors, photographs, and objects from one of America's greatest nineteenth-century architects will illustrate how the visionary's career transformed American architecture.
Richard Morris Hunt (1827-1895) was the first American to complete the prestigious architecture program at the Ecole des Beaux Arts in Paris. Hunt trained in the atelier of Hector Martin Lefuel, later appointed by Napoleon III to complete the final wing of the Louvre after the death of Viollet le Duc. Lefuel selected Hunt, his American student of ten years, to serve as clerk of the works for this important project. Hunt brought Europe's Beaux Arts tradition to the United States in prominent works like Cornelius Vanderbilt II's "The Breakers" in Newport, and the Administration Building at World's Columbian Exposition (Click here to take a virtual tour of the World's Columbian Exposition). From his early student days of the 1840s until his death in 1895, Hunt spent his career "professionalizing" the profession of an architect. A founding member, first secretary, and third president of the American Institute of Architects coupled with a long and distinguished career earned him the title the "Dean of American Architecture" among his peers. Detail of the New York Historical Society
This exhibition traces Hunt's career from his days as a student tothe projects at the end of his career, the Biltmore Estate in Asheville, North Carolina, and the Fifth Avenue Wing of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. He designed over 220 projects during his career, many of which are well-known nineteenth-century icons including private residences, public buildings, university libraries, religious structures, and commercial buildings. He also worked in collaboration with some of America's greatest sculptors, designing pedestals for their art. The most notable is the pedestal for Statue of Liberty, designed with Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi and Gustave Eiffel.
Many projects, however, were not realized. Of particular interest is the remarkable and little known story of his designs for the Southern Entrances to New York's Central Park. The controversy related to the design of the entrances was a popular and daily topic in the New York City newspapers of the day. The project, ultimately awarded to Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux, was the disappointment of Hunt's career. Hunt and Olmsted did not work together again until the very end of their careers, when they were brought together by young George Washington Vanderbilt to create the Biltmore Estate. Hunt's designs for the Central Park Gates and their intense story reveal the strong personality of the man, his philosophy about architecture, his integrity for his profession, and his desire to bring the Beaux-Arts tradition to the American public.
Richard Morris Hunt's phenomenal career was the reflection of a passionate innovator. He founded the first American architectural atelier, designed one of the first buildings with an elevator (the Tribune building) and in the process established the Beaux Arts style as the dominate influence in American Architecture. His commitment to the profession could be summarized by the Latin inscription in his library: "Ars Longa, Vita Brevis Est" - "Art is long, life is brief."
As part of the 150th Anniversary Celebration of Central Park, Parks, Palaces and Public Buildings highlights Hunt's designs for Central Park and other structures in the context of his career. The exhibition is on loan from the Print and Drawings Collection of The Octagon, American Architectural Foundation, Washington, DC. This exhibition was co-curated by Tracy Kamerer, Chief Curator of the Flagler Museum, and Sherry Birk, Special Advisor to the American Architectural Foundation and former Director of the Octagon.D trading aps

Gender roles and social norms determine how males and females should act in a relationship. However, there is a gender role reversal in this audio to help listeners understand that we may not always act out our gender roles just because society tells us to, which is perfectly fine. Just like Kayla in this audio is not your stereotypical “housewife, woman” because of her job as a police officer. However, Kayla knows what she wants and is comfortable with her gender and personality enough to negotiate within her relationship. It is up to us to determine our own gender roles and decide what we are comfortable with.
- Can you identify examples of gender roles and social norms in this vignette?
- How do you think the gender roles and social norms that you just identified affects Kayla’s and Michael’s relationship?
- How do you feel about Kayla’s gender role reversal?
Vignette 2: “ Breaking the rules”
Relationship violence is an underreported issue. As a victim, there can be many reasons why it is difficult to let anyone know about the problem whether it is a family member, friend, or medical provider. Therefore, it is important for us to recognize signs of relationship violence and be more sensitive towards the situation. This can help the victim become more comfortable with disclosing information and allow someone to get them the appropriate help they need.
- What do you think Maria and Dr. Smith’s office did wrong in this audio vignette?
- What would be a more appropriate response that Maria could of gave Tianna after learning about their relationships issues?
- How do you think Dr. Smith’s office has affected Tiana’s perspective about healthcare providers?
Vignette 3: : “Walking on eggshells”
Relationship violence can happen to anyone in any type of relationship whether it is heterosexual or homosexual. In the audio, Andrews experiences verbal abuse from his partner Vincent. They both experience the same social and gender roles as heterosexual people. However, social norms have stereotypes towards same sex couples that affect our judgment. It is important for us to understand that same sex relationships can also experience the same types of violence as heterosexual relationship.
- Can you identify the signs of an unhealthy relationship in this vignette?
- After identifying the signs of an unhealthy relationship, do you think they are similar to a heterosexual relationship and why?
- Did this vignette offer a different aspect of relationships and why?

[/full_width]Nothing sparks a good headline quite like a royal romance. Now that William and Catherine are married, with kids and infinitely boring, we continue to watch the comings and goings of Harry’s female friends. 2014 saw Cressida Bonas come and go. And then (allegedly) come again go, again. In what appeared to be a bold statement, Cress walked the We Day carpet, presumably in support of not only her sort-of-sister in law (Holly Branson), but also her boyfriend, Prince Harry. Harry played a significant role in the event, delivering a speech about “giving back” to the more than 12,000 young people in attendance.
After returning to his seat, Cressida was photographed congratulating him with an affectionate embrace. Photos of the two of them graced the front pages and media from around the world predicted that an engagement was coming soon – camera shy Cressida had taken a big step on her journey toward life as a Royal by showing up at an official engagement to support her man. Only weeks later, it was reported that the two had broken up, supposedly over a row about Harry attending Guy Pelly’s wedding + related activities in Memphis, Tennessee. Cressida was papped numerous times over the next several months looking sullen and teary eyed. But then, just when we had all written this frail, fragile looking wee blonde off, BAM, Cress pulls a Kate Middleton. At least that’s what the media hypothesized – just like Kate had done after her highly publicized break up with William in 2007, Cress was living it up, single and ready to mingle. From sullen to smiley, Cress was creating a new story for us; one that saw her surrounded by girlfriends, breaking out some side boob, putting on lipstick – this girl was just fine.
Enter summer. Enter Camilla Thurlow.
We now know, if she was anything at all, she was a summer fling. After a little spit swapping at a club one night, we knew all about the Scottish beauty queen who once worked as a store clerk at Abercrombie + Fitch, and was now working for Harry’s mother’s charity, Halo Trust. By the end of August, the media had Harry and the brunette beauty shacked up on a yacht in St. Tropez and wedding bells were heard off in the distance.
Riiiiight….
REWIND
By September, the wedding bells and kilt laden ceremony at Westminster Abby was off, because WHAMMO Cress was snapped at the closing ceremony of the Invictus Games. And then again, with Harry at a movie.
Cressida, exit stage left. We haven’t seen the two of them together again since. Although it’s been reported that Harry has been snogging around and / or hooking up with randoms, nothing has really stuck.
So, the Harry and Cressida question still looms. Are they? Aren’t they? Who the hell knows. All I really know is that Cress has game. And we know Harry likes a good chase. If they are still together they are flying under the radar. In a huge way – Cressida has gone off to vocal training in Scotland and Harry is still in England. Maybe she’ll run into Cammie T and there’ll be a Scottish throw down, Highland Games style. One can only dream…The Originators of Quick & Easy Cooking!

>!From time to time one come across the album that would justly deserve two reviews instead of one. And this is exactly the case with this specific record. These two separate reviews might be something like these below:
"Krzysztof Urbański debut recording titled simply Urbański announces the arrival on Polish jazz scene of extremely talented saxophonist. In his playing, technically impeccable, there is present whole tradition of jazz saxophone masters in persons of John Coltrane (Urbański's interpretation of his Giant Steps is small gem of this record), Sonny Rollins or Joe Henderson. In terms of technical ability, musicality and creativity (he composed majority of the songs present on this album) Urbański may be compared to Joshua Redman. Like Redman Urbański is devoted to traditional jazz, uncompromised by unnecessary additions from musical genres other than this which he loves most. But what is most important this straight-ahead, mainstream and bop climate always sound fresh because the attitude of Urbański and his colleagues towards jazz is joyous, daring and adventorous. This new bunch of pirates arrived on Polish jazz scene that shall bring us many more treasures in following years!"
The other review might be going like that:
"To the music which we ancounter on Krzysztof Urbański debut album one may apply such terms as mainstream, straighthead and post bop. But also conservative, predictable, obvious. Well, perhaps, my inclination toward free and improvised face of jazz speaks here for itself but although I admire technical capabilities of musicians involved in this project I still must confess that nothing on this record suprised me. I felt like all notes and tempos were perfectly executed but I could also forsee them for ages before and, worst of all, I have a strange feeling I already met them thousands times before. Listening to this excellent musicianship in progress I could not help but see some similarities between Urbański and Joshua Redman who also is technically stellar but sounds to me always secondary to his obvious masters in persons of John Coltrane, Sonny Rollins or Joe Henderson. Whether Urbański (and his cooperatives) will be able to deliver something more challenging over following years remains an open question...".
Strangely to say but I feel like both those positions are to some degree defendable in case of this album. If you want to judge by yourself please visit the site of Krzysztof Urbański and listen to some of his music:Bless Your Heart Graphic Sweatshirt

Poison Ivy and oak are plants that cause a very uncomfortable skin rash that is unbearably itchy and red. The allergic reaction is known as contact dermatitis and is the most common skin problem produced by plants.
What causes the rash to occur?
The rash is caused by sticky oil known as urushiol and is found on virtually every poison ivy and oak. The rash can only be spread through the oil and cannot be spread by touching the blisters from someone else infected. You can get the rash from:
- Touching any part of the plant including the leaves, flowers, stems, berries, roots, and even a dead plant.
- Touching any item that has come in contact with the plant including clothing, sports gear, pets, or gardening tools.
Common Symptoms of Poison Ivy
- Itching.
- Redness after initial contact with the plant.
- Small red bumps
- Blisters that can possibly leak fluid.
If you believe you have Poison Ivy and are in need of serious medical attention visit our urgent care location, we have the treatment plan necessary to help calm the symptoms and heal the rash. Our walk-in center requires no appointment and is open Monday – Friday 8am -8pm and Saturday & Sunday 8am – 5pm.Sooo I finally became an expert at something other than TV and “yes that hat makes your head look dumb”. It’s official: I know way more than any one person ever needed to know about the Civil War. It’s a little bit ridiculous, actually – there are all these random nuggets of information that seem to have dislodged from the whole and they keep popping into my head at any given moment. Anyway, yes, I took my final for the mini session today, after three VERY solid days of studying. Not sure how I did because he kind of caught everyone off guard with some of the questions but pretty much right now I am The Complete Civil War Encyclopedia: Callison Edition. And oh, is it the most random information. Percentage of Civil War deaths bayonet-related? 2. Name of Ulysses S. Grant’s horse? Cincinnati. Name of the guy who invented the “land torpedo” that would evolve into the modern land mine? Peter Gabriel. Yep. I’m pretty sure that in my notes I even wrote “I (heart) Lloyd Dobler”.
Ugh. I wrote for three solid hours on that stuff, and I know it must be getting to me because I actually got ANGRY when I was writing about Jefferson Davis replacing Joseph E. Johnston with John Bell Hood to face WT Sherman before the battle of Atlanta. What? Exactly. Don’t worry about it. But for the next 72 hours or so, if you need to know anything about the Civil War…I’m your girl.Artist: South Park Mexican Album: Hillwood Song: H-Town G-Funk Typed by: younghtownplaya@aol.com, no1wammy@hotmail.com [South Park Mexican] (Verse 1) My sweet 'Llac fall back, just creeping on three wheels A bitch to my right cocked giving me cheap thrills I see meals Coming down my path In the ghetto cat's wrath, making math I'm the last to blast, on that ass, now you the past It's no joke, you get smoked like buddah grass Who the fastest Punk, I'm like Cassius And when I crash this, you catch WHIP lashes Bitch, I'm on a mission, to listen And give descriptions Hung G's in my hood and their intentions I hear gunshots ringing like hell's bells I see drug sells, check out my thug tales Fuck jails, bank swells keeps hella grip And I can sell dope on ice And never slip They serving Kibbles N' Bits while I'm cuttin' bricks Save my crumbs for the ones who sucking dicks I may get rich on the ditch, you quick snap I left that cut, now they wonder where the bricks at My green shit stacks Still clip packs Thirty-six Lead homies, so don't trip jack It's the wetback, hittin' on the bongs Son, in the long run, I'll be the strong one Hook: South Park Mexican If you step in my hood, bitch, you will get blasted It's nothin' but that H-Town G-funk If you step in my hood, bitch, you will get blasted It's nothin' but that H-Town G-funk Repeat Hook [South Park Mexican] Yeah, this for all them hustlers in Hillwood, South Park Hun (Verse 2) I told ya Boy, you must have caught amnesia Tryin' to jack, now you're on your back, breathin' anastesia You got blasted, cause you trespassed it They never lasted In the game I mastered You stupid bastard, tell me what's your final word Before I let this lead tip, hit your spinal cord Oh, you was ready, just beggin' to gank me Now your ass is just dead and stanky I put my foot, in your shit like the hokey pokey Leave the scene, now everything's okey dokey Your homies know me But they won't FUCK with this Cause now they know That I can sure BUCK a bitch I'm the macker, plus the gun packer So you little jackers Best stick to [{*crackers*}] Cause fucking with this Mex gets your neck broke Stuck like Chuck Straight fucked, and in check, loc Cause I think fast, when I'm in the slow lane Get in my domain, and fall back with no brain So don't raid Or try to rain on my parade Cause I'm strapped from my blade To my grenade Repeat Hook Twice (Verse 3) My sweet Texas, restless Wantin' to ride Lexus Check this or flex this I get wreckless Unbelievable, lyrical, cynical Here we go, Mary-go-round, I down critical Street stamina, dammin' a cop Slammin' a punk And jammin' my Funk I'm the man with the skill, for real Guard my grill with steel On Sundays, I kneel On my knees to Jesus, please seize us Cause my boy's in trouble And he needs us Got a bat, my homie's on the double Punks want trouble I Bam Bam Rubble Still the son of a gun, havin' big fun Come and get some I leave you wet, mon Fill your lead with an infra red I put the best to bed, they call him Dead Fuckin' Fred Shed my skin like a snake on a vine Climbin' on the crime side, comin' around the blind side We fall in ranks like a motherfuckin' pyramid And I'm the top block, will I stop Never did Make it past the ninth grade But got life made Chose that dope, and I hope, I picked the right trade Repeat Hook TwiceVictory Care hampers

First this is the pattern. It's Simplicity 8089:
This pattern comes in XXS - XXL sizes all in one envelope. BIG DISLIKE. Because the individual sizes are cut for multiple measurements, these tend to not fit me well.

Get a computer that has the features you want at a price you're willing to pay.Loch Ness, mysterious, dark waters, hiding a monster or an overhyped lake in the Scottish Highlands? Perhaps a bit of both.
Loch Ness is a huge loch {Side note: Don’t call it a lake, you will offend the locals!} just outside of Inverness. The loch is full of cold, dark water. The water is dark because of the peat in the soil and the water temperature never rises above 7 degrees C. While the loch varies in depth, at it’s deepest, 66 double-decker busses could be stacked, nose to nose and only then would one reach from the bottom to the top of the loch. It’s deep. Legend has it that Nessie, the Loch Ness Monster lives in the lake.
Frances and I headed out to see if we could catch a glimpse of Nessie, or just see the loch in all it’s beauty. We certainly succeeded at the latter. To get to Loch Ness we took the Jacobite Temptation tour. Our tour began with a bus ride to the ferry. During the 35 minute ride, our tour guide, Sue, told us history of the town, river and loch. Then we had a 30 minute ferry ride across the loch. Earlier in the day it had been rainy, but during the ferry ride the rain mostly held off, although it did spit on us some. Clouds hung low in the sky, the water looked dark and foreboding; it was eerily beautiful.
Our ferry docked at Urquhart Castle and we got off to explore. The current ruins of the castle date back to the 1500’s, but history shows that there has been some sort of a fortress at this site since the 300’s. We had nearly an hour to explore the ruins and appreciate the beauty of the stones against the water.
After an hour, we boarded our bus back to town. On the way back, we were able to spot the shaggy highland cows that the locals call Heighlen Kuhe.
In the end we didn’t see Nessie, of course that means I’ll need to return and try again!This study reaffirms what we already know from research– teacher experience matters, not degrees, where you went to school, or nearly any other objective correlative that can be identified.
Here it says that other methods for improving teacher effectiveness will be explored – including “ voluntary all-day kindergarten, smaller classes, professional development for all staff, focused instructional support, and extended day and school year options.”
Probably full-day K matters (though I haven’t seen definitive research on this.) Of the others cited, the only reform that research clearly shows makes a difference is reducing class size.
For all the talk about professional development, there is very little evidence that indicates that using any particular method of PD, or even increasing PD in general, has led to better results. And the research on extended day and school year is also very weak.
Reducing class size also leads to lower teacher attrition rates and more experienced teachers – so you get two bangs for the buck.
Published: December 3, 2007
Teacher Experience Matters Most
Teacher experience, and not advanced degrees, has a greater effect on how well students succeed, a new state report says.
"In the first few years on the job, a teacher gains considerably in her or his ability to improve the academic performance of students," said the report issued Sunday by the Washington State Institute for Public Policy. report was made for a state task force looking at basic education funding. The Legislature assigned the task force to find the best way to pay for education that improves student achievement and graduation rates..
Former state legislator Dan Grimm, chairman of the task force, said it will spend next year coming up with proposals for the 2009 legislative session to consider.Google – can be fully impregnated with Google technologies. Well, it is a long way to go! We shall find how Google is helping pay your bills through mobile.
Google Wallet is an application on your phone will enable you make payments through your mobile. Currently Google Wallet is available through Samsung Nexus S 4G offered by Sprint. The mobile is fitted with a chip which is built on NFC (Near Field Communication) technology.
If Apple is able to develop its own version of NFC, Google Wallet feature may appear in iPhone 5. Google expects that NFC technology may be extended to other mobile platforms in the coming one year. For using Google Wallet, you still need Credit Cards (physically) which are PayPass compliant that means these cards will have PayPass logo on it. Then you have to link this Credit Card with the Google’s prepaid card. Linking your Credit Card with Google Wallet is as simple as filling a form with user information. Once the service is activated on your mobile you will be able to pay bills from your mobile. Your mobile is protected with a password to perform financial transactions.
Just like credit cards and debit cards are used with card readers arranged in merchant locations, mobiles enabled for Google Wallet can be used in merchant establishments which have PayPass logo on it. Just tap your phone at the PayPass kiosk and you will be able to pay your bills by being able to read all compatible credit cards, debit cards, prepaid cards and gift cards. MasterCard claims that PayPass service is already available at hundreds of thousands of merchant locations. So, finding a retail stores that accepts payments through Google Wallet may not be a big deal. As of now, the information flows from phone to kiosk only and in future it will be extended so that your phone gets confirmation in the form of digital receipt with a transaction code and reference number.
In the first phase of implementation of Google Wallet, the service is available only through Sprint. Analysts view this Google’s exclusive relationship with Sprint with much skepticism as there might be an understanding between them to market Google Wallet to the next level. Google claims that the data transferred from mobile to kiosks goes in a secured form (encrypted format) and the data will be dealt with only Google Wallet application. It will not be shared with other applications present on the mobile. As per the recent survey, consumers aged above 50 were not in favor of using Google Wallet service. It is also known that 61% of iPhone users prefer Google Wallet from Apple compared to 46% of Android users.
It is likely that Apple may develop its own NFC technology to equip their users with Google Wallet service by effectively integrating with the Google’s payment infrastructure.IncSIM is a application that enables perform calculation of landscape metrics over categorized raster and vector data. This metrics are statistical coefficients that contain information about the size, amount or strength of one characteristic in a fragment of categorized satellite image or vector geospatial data. Complete image is divided in a regular square grid of given by user size (usually area values from 1ha to 100ha) where each cell represents a landscape. For each cell from the grid is defined the value of selected indicator.
At last version, IncSim enables calculation of more than 50 indicators.
About incSIM
Application has been developed under Matlab, but it has compiled as a standalone application therefore Matlab is not needed for it execution. Last version (1.0.6) enables to work with images in GeoTIFF format and vector data in Shapefile, visualize imported data and show the results after calculations. Aditionally obtained results can be exported in GeoTIFF, Shapefile, KML or Ascii Grid Format in order to enable interoperability with third party applications and realize aditional analyzes.
IncSIM also inlcudes a tool for multithreading batch processing that enable to calculate various landscape metrics over more than one image at once.

The first book of the specified series – ‘The art of the deal’ — has been published and presented in one of the national net of bookstores "Bukva".
Publisher and director of ‘KM Books Publishing Group’ Yaroslav Marynovych informed about this on his page on Facebook.
‘We set a goal to publish a lot of non-fiction and business books this year. In general Publishing House plans to publish two more Tramp’s books with real stories and wise advice on how to reach success and to take an honorable place in a cohort of successful people: Think like a Billionaire and How to get rich’. — Yaroslav Marynovych noted.
As it known, the book ‘The art of the deal’ gained a huge success soon after its release. For the first 48 weeks of its implementation it was included into the list of №1 bestselling books according to The New York Times. Trump’s book firmly kept on the front page of mentioned media for the first 13 weeks after its release. Furthermore, ‘The art of the deal’ brought the author huge fees and made him World business icon.
In this edition Donald Tramp detail tells about the management, career, finances, and discloses personal secrets of doing business. However, he doesn’t hesitate to mention mistakes.
To get to know the new US President better and to understand his actions it is necessary to read this book. Here are three Trump’s striking quotes:
‘I like thinking big. To me it’s very simple: if you’re going to be thinking anyway, you might as well think big.’
‘I play it very loose. I don't carry a briefcase. I try not to schedule too many meetings. I leave my door open. . . . I prefer to come to work each day and just see what develops’.
‘I always go into a deal anticipating the worst. If you plan for the worst — if you can live with the worst — the good will always take care of itself’.
Today Donald Trump's book ‘The art of the deal’ is sold in all bookstores of Ukraine including a national net of bookstores "Bukva".

I was reading the other day about how queen bees get created. You see, all the bee larvae start
out equal, and all receive a little bit of the divine royal jelly for a while. But at a certain point one hatchling is mysteriously
selected to be fed exclusively royal jelly while the others get only pollen and nectar.
This hatchling becomes
the queen of the hive, while the others become worker bees and drones. Now, I'm guessing that you, like me, did not get selected
in your family to be a ruling monarch. I was not raised on the magic ingredient that would make me the "queen" of
my own life. In terms of my energy system, I was fed a lot of garbage--negative energies, actions and messages--that got mixed
in with whatever energetic royal jelly I also received. I'm not saying this to blame my family or our society--just to note
that there's a lot of negativity and sometimes actual harm that we encounter as we grow up.
But as I thought of
this little analogy, I reminded myself...unlike bees, we humans get the chance to remake our lives. We get to go from drone
to ruler of our lives, through our own efforts and the help of others. In effect, if we choose to, we can start giving ourselves
the royal jelly of metamorphosis, no matter how badly we were "fed" as we grew up.
What's royal jelly
for you? For me, it was EFT tapping. I had done a lot of things to turn my life around and overcome some tough early experiences.
Some helped a bit. But none of them really made me start feeling like the monarch of my own self and what happens in my life,
in the way EFT did.
So I make sure I feed myself some "royal jelly" every day, with tapping. How about
you? What's your "royal jelly"? And are you getting enough of it in your life right now?

The objective of the ARVI Project is to resolve the safety issues that remain unresolved for the melt vessel interaction phase of the in-vessel progression of a severe accident. The work consists of experiments and analysis development. Four tests were performed in the EC-FOREVER Programme, in which failure was achieved in-vessels employing the French pressure vessel steel. The tests were analysed with the commercial code ANSYS-Multiphysics, and the codes SYSTUS+ and PASULA, and quite good agreement was achieved for the failure location. Natural convection experiments in stratified pools have been performed in the SIMECO and the COPO facilities, which showed that much greater heat is transferred downwards for immiscible layers or before layers mix. A model for gap cooling and a set of simplified models for the system codes have been developed. MVITA code calculations have been performed for the Czech and Hungarian VVERs, towards evaluation of the in-vessel melt retention accident management scheme. Tests have been performed at the ULPU facility with organised flow for vessel external cooling. Considerable enhancement of the critical heat flux (CHF) was obtained. The ARVI Project has reached the halfway stage. This paper presents the results obtained thus far from the project.Poplar Wooden Storage sheds As well as Furnishings
Wooden may be the actual selected materials with regard to creating wooden storage sheds as well as furnishings with regard to countless 12 months.

NEXT Post:r.f ss316 double flanged knife gate valveAnother gem from what is now a semi-regular series from Alan Clarke. Long may it continue!
Hastings 1905 or 1907
When I find interesting old images I can’t recognise, I send them to my photographic detective friend Tony.
I sent him the seaside image you see here.
The original was discovered hidden away in the museum, and has now been scanned, referenced and enclosed in a numbered box in one of the museum’s image archive rooms. This is Tony’s reply, slightly altered by me.
“I’m sure that you will be pleased to know that I have managed to identify the location of the seaside photo. I started investigating soon after you sent it.
I assumed that it was taken in the UK as there is a union flag flying on the seafront. I also guessed that it could be on the south coast so I looked for a Victorian resort, built on rapidly rising ground and, having a pier and an unusual hexagonal building. I found that in some respects Hastings seemed to be a good match so I found an aerial view of Hastings on Google Earth and studied it.
The photo shows what could be a flagpole and what might be the end of a wall. See annotation on photo. From the Google Earth view of Hastings I found a flagpole in the castle and took the wall to be the castle wall. Starting at the flagpole in the castle grounds, I drew a line on the Google aerial view which crossed the castle wall just before the wall ends. Assuming it is Hastings and the flagpole position has not changed in 110 years, by this use of parallax, the camera was positioned somewhere along this line.
Both the photos and the Google aerial view show multi-storey houses with bay windows, and both also show a coast road which bends sharply as it approaches the west end of the picture. So far so good.
What I wanted to find, as confirmation, was a photo of Hastings showing the distinctive hexagonal building and the pier. I found pictures of piers at Hastings through the ages but none was of the design shown in the picture, and I could find no reference to the hexagonal building.
Additionally, the Google aerial picture shows a far larger distance between the sea and the base of the rock formation on which the castle stands. Thus, if it was Hastings, at some time since the Victorian era, land has been reclaimed. This would place the coast road shown in your photo further back from the current coast road shown in the Google aerial photo.
At this stage I felt there was insufficient evidence to say with certainty that Hastings was the true location.
Returning to the task a few days ago I looked at the lower right of the photo, which I had dismissed as containing nothing of interest, to see BRODERICKS SERIES. This is embossed on the photograph where I have placed the green exclamation mark. I discovered that Frederick Nutt Broderick 1878-1913 was a photographer based in the Isle of Wight.
AND
Frederick Nutt Broderick’s photographic business was established when picture postcards were being introduced into England. In the 1900’s, Broderick travelled along the south coast taking photographs of seaside towns, later publishing them as picture postcards; including a number of postcards featuring views of Hastings in 1905 and 1907. His eldest daughter Aurora acted as his assistant and, rather predictably, when he issued his postcards of Hastings, he published them as the Aurora series. A photograph taken around 1910 showing a white bearded Broderick with his wife Emily and his two daughters, Aurora and Emmeline, appeared in a recent book on Hastings in old photographs.
These are the links to Mr Broderick:
I suspect that the photo could have been taken from a Hastings hotel in which Mr Broderick was staying. It would have been a good vantage point and a hotel room with a bay window would have been a convenient place to set up a plate camera.”
Alan continues: On receiving this communciation from Tony, I went back through the museum’s archive of photographs and found three more images with Broderick embossed faintly on them; Carisbroke Castle, Carisbroke Church and the Needles from Alum Bay, all three the Isle of Wight. Thus, Hastings, as the fourth photo, doesn’t fit this set as it isn’t on the IoW.
The discrepancies of the hexagonal building, wrong pier structure and land reclamation worried me. Could there be somewhere like this on the Isle of Wight? Ventnor came to mind, so I queried Google as to whether Ventnor ever had a pier. Yes it did! I soon came up with the second image here, an almost perfect match. So, it is Ventnor IoW, and not Hasting, after all.Singapore Shopping
I had too much to say last time (golly gee, surprise surprise) so here are a few other points I wanted to note about Singapore. (Part 3.) Mostly about money.
'Til you drop. Some tourist brochure said that shopping is almost a national sport in Singapore. From observing the people on Orchard Road, I'd have to agree. Except ... I don't really understand why. I mean, for the brands and shops that we also have in Taiwan, the prices aren't any better than back home (and brands are expensive in Taiwan).
The only reason we shopped as much as we did was because they have Zara and a few other stores I can't find in Taipei. I also found a new store called Raoul -- part of the FJ Benjamin group, which also owns La Senza and GUESS? -- that carries extremely nice dress shirts at outstandingly high prices. (I still left with two shirts, because I got 15% off. What. I'm into French cuffs now.) But anyway, if I lived in Hong Kong, I wouldn't have bothered to buy anything in Singapore. Oh yeah, and I got a few logowear T-shirts.
Plastic money. To shop, you need money. Cash or plastic? Well, how about both? The new Singapore Dollar bills here are some kind of plastic polymer: $2, $10, $50. Yeah, plastic money. Cool! Even cooler, they have a little plastic transparent window in them, in certain spots! So you can literally hold it up to your eye and see through it, even though I wouldn't recommend it, because it's not like they let you see through clothes or whatever. (Note to self: if I ever run a country, x-ray windows on the money.)
Fine. Singapore is mostly nice and clean, and people conduct themselves in (again mostly) orderly fashion. Because, as the saying goes,
"Singapore is a fine city."
That is, as in, there's a fine for spitting, fine for parking, fine for chewing gum, fine for littering, a fine for eating durians in public, fine for just about anything else you can think of! Your wallet is basically scared into falling into line!
So because of the fares and because there aren't that many cabs to make it competitive, you'll often find drivers who ... don't have the customer's interests in mind. There's usually a long line for the taxi stops, but several cabs will sit empty just around the corner (and they refuse to drive you if you walk up and ask) ... until enough people get fed up with the line and book a cab. They punch in that they're in the area, and then drive up to pick you up. Bling! They just pocketed the extra booking fee.
Or you'll get cabbies who refuse to pick you up at 11:25pm because by waiting another 5 more minutes, he can kick in the next bracket of late-night surcharges. Not even if your ride would only take 5 or 10 minutes anyway, and just slightly out of the popular nightspot areas. Bastards.
Okay, that's enough about Singapore. Back to stupid thoughts of my own life. :-)

My aim is to help prepare you mentally, physically and emotionally for birthing your baby and for parenthood. Discussion, education, relaxation, massage, muscle/ligament alignment, visualisation, diet analysis & nutritional advice, herbal/homeopathic supplements and physical examinations of both yourself and your baby contribute to this. I would request pathology and ultrasounds as indicated. My antenatal care is aimed at having both you and your baby in the best possible health so that the birth outcome is optimal. Over the course of our antenatal time together, I hope to achieve a close trusting relationship so that the birth atmosphere is as calm and warm as possible. Antenatal appointments of 60-90 mins allow plenty of time for open conversation, questions and information sharing, which allows me to become familiar with your beliefs, aspirations and fears around birth.
I believe strongly that you should make informed choices about all aspects of your care and endeavour to provide you with:
*Accurate information
*Choices
*Advantages and disadvantages of different procedures
*Statistical and anecdotal evidence
*Time to consider options
*Emotional support regardless of the decision you make
I believe it is the responsibility and right of every birthing woman to choose the birth place and birth carer that best align with her philosophy and beliefs around birth. She should feel safe with her chosen carer and environment. In regard to this, I believe women’s social, emotional, physical, spiritual and cultural choices and needs should be honoured and supported. Institutions and politics in our country do not consistently support this philosophy, however, so together we continue to passionately fight for these rights.

When you first heard that Emily Brontë's brooding Victorian love story was going to be staged as a Bollywood musical by Sanjay off of EastEnders, naturally your hopes were high. No matter that the novel, according to the Guardian's Michael Billington, has already been the source for "23 plays, 14 musicals, 16 TV and radio adaptations and eight films". And never mind that Deepak Verma has decided to cut the vengeful second half of the book, thereby bringing his version "closer to Mills and Boon than King Lear" (Billington).
What clearly transcended these quibbles was that, as the Times's Clive Davis puts it, "Brontë's taste for the Gothic and Mumbai's love of melodrama ought to have made a promising match". And after all, everybody loves a bit of Bolly, don't they? What's not to like about an incredibly long and incomprehensible Indian musical? And yet ... you can probably already guess which way this is going to go.
When voicing your opinion you must, like most of the critics, demonstrate that you have really done your best to like this Wuthering Heights musical. A quick string of somewhat feeble compliments should do it. "Kristine Landon-Smith's production makes an agreeable spectacle," says Billington, for instance, adding that, "Sue Mayes's design beautifully evokes russet Rajasthan skies, and the acting is perfectly good."
Or you might observe that Verma's adaptation is "close enough to be familiar and is generally successful," as Ian Shuttleworth of the Financial Times does. "A couple of the songs ... prove haunting, too," says Kate Bassett, piping up to fill an awkward silence in the Independent on Sunday. "I only wish I could recommend [it] with ardency," shrugs the Telegraph's Dominic Cavendish, without any. "You can see how it might look good on the big screen; on stage, it feels dramatically malnourished."
Having tried to like the show, however, it is time to join the chorus of disapproval. Davis, in particular, pulls on his kicking boots. "This half-hearted pairing [of styles] yields neither spectacle nor psychological insight," he thunders. "Felix Cross and Sheema Mukherjee's lip-synched music – specially recorded in India, although you would hardly guess it – is never more than tepid. And Kristine Landon-Smith's direction delivers little of the visual energy that is the hallmark of the Bollywood industry." He pauses to get his breath back. And then he resumes. "The decision to pepper the dialogue with Hindi phrases is irritating too." Boot. Stamp. Bludgeon. "My Indian wife has taught me quite a few over the years, but I was still left in the dark as my neighbours chuckled away."
To avoid being mistaken for one of Davis's neighours, you might finally want to point out that if you did chuckle, it was only because you found a moment that was laugh-out-loud bad. Helpfully, Bassett has provided this example: "'She walks across the sand, like she's floating on air,' croons the smitten Vijay," Bassett observes, "even as Youkti Patel's Shakuntala hobbles out of a wheelchair, recovering from a gunshot wound to the calf. I know love is blind, but this is ridiculous."
Do say: Bollywood is so marvellously vibrant and life-affirming.
Don't say: Shouldn't this be about three hours longer?

Wade, who was already contractually obligated to defend his title at ROC 49, was asked to compete on the UFC 177: Dillashaw Barao card by UFC matchmakers. Seeing the possible contract dilemma at hand, Wade’s team called Lou Neglia to give him the news.
In typical fashion, Lou immediately congratulated Chris, ripped up his contract and wished him well at UFC 177. “Once I heard the news, I immediately ripped up Chris’s contract for ROC 49,” said Lou Negila, president of Ring of Combat. “What other promotion would do that? Being a former fighter, I know where these fighters want to get to and that is to the UFC,” he continued.
Chris Wade also remembers the conversation he had with Lou. “He just congratulated me and told me that he knows I will be victorious with my fighting style, fighting spirit, and ability,” said Wade.
Both Lou and Chris feel that the time spent in the Ring of Combat circuit will serve him well in the elite ranks of the UFC. “One thing I always say and truly believe in is that great fights make great fighters,” said Lou. “All the guys at the Ring of Combat are tested from the ground up. And I truly feel this is why many are finding success against the world’s best in the UFC,” he continued.
“I absolutely feel that ROC has helped prepare me for the UFC,” said Wade. “Let's face it, the track record speaks for itself, Weidman, Gordon, Barbosa, LaFlare, Laquinta, and on and on. It is a consistent hot of fighting talent. I really feel like I am constantly developing and that I am a problem for any man in the world at 155 to deal with. ROC has helped to give me that confidence.” he continued.
Chris now joins Weidman, Serra, Edgar, Barbosa and many more as ROC alumni to leave for the UFC. And just like those before him, he plans on supporting the Ring of Combat promotion. “My time with Lou Neglias ROC has been amazing,” said Wade. “It's been such a great journey that has allowed me to learn the sport and continuously challenge myself which in turn has bettered me as a fighter. I look forward to continuing to come back to watch Lou's events which I will always call home. Ring of Combat will always be near and dear to me,” he continued.
Ring of Combat 49 continues to be a stellar card and Lou feels that any of the other ROC champions could be next in line to get the call from the UFC! “This is the next generation of MMA fighters on this card,” said Lou. “These guys are young and hungry and ready to put on a show come September 19th,” he continued.
When asked who he thought could be next to enter the UFC, Lou thinks it could be any of the current champs but Andre Harrison may be the one. “I have confidence that any of the ROC champs could be called any minute,” said Lou. “There’s Arce, there’s Jenkins, and it could be any of them. It may be Andre Harrison. He is such a dominant and imposing fighter and he could wreak havoc in the UFC’s featherweight division. But whoever it is, one thing I know for sure, they will represent the Ring of Combat well and will have success in the UFC,” finished Lou.
The Ring of Combat 49 card features:
Pete Sell (10-6) vs Elijah Harshbarger (7-4); Andre Harrison (6-0) vs Jeff Lentz (9-4-1); Matt Rizzo (6-2) vs Jimmy Grant (5-1); Julio Arce (5-0) vs Jake Grigson (5-3); Pat DeFranco (4-3) vs Mervin Rodriguez (5-8); Oluwale Bamgbose (2-0) vs Armin Mrkanovic (0-0); Gregor Gillespie (2-0) vs Justin Harrington (6-1); Max Bohanan (1-0) vs Brandon Priest (1-5); Mike Elshamy (1-1) vs Ryan King (0-1); Merab Dvalishvili (0-1) vs Dennis Dombrow (6-4); Cody Mooney (0-1) vs Somner Martin (2-4); Aaron Freedman (0-1) vs Dan Corchado; Randy Brown (1-0) vs Yousef Al-Ghoul (3-2)

What if the prayer I have been praying doesn’t feel like it’s going anywhere?
What if I asked someone else to pray for my request, someone who may have been in this same position and is more aware of God’s interest and involvement?
What if my prayers for someone else gave me hope and faith for my own needs?
What if more than one of us prayed for the same thing, would it have greater effect?
What if I’m not sure that I am praying according to God’s will?
What if I don’t have enough faith?
What if praying with others could give me more confidence in my praying for my own need, as well as for those I care about?
What if I don’t know the right words to explain my need?
What if I’m upset with God and don’t think He will listen to me?
What if I don’t want to pray, especially out loud?
What if I feel that God is going to do whatever He wants, with or without my prayer?
If any of the above sounds like something you may have felt or thought, welcome to the reality of our humanity. How we move forward will depend on our relationship with the Lord. We serve a wonderful, loving, patient Lord Jesus who is human as well as divine, and has been touched with every emotional feeling and heartache that any of us could every experience.
Not only has He “been there and done that,” He overcame and walked out with the victory. It’s the enemy of our faith who interferes with our thinking and counters with the thought, “hath God said,” about all that we “know” about the grace and mercy of our Savior. When our feelings are telling us one thing and the Word tells us another, we are the ones who need to make a deliberate choice.
The enemy loves to make you think that someone else is more spiritual that you are. Jesus is no respecter of persons. The faintest thought or cry is loud and clear to His waiting ear and heart. Praise God, He also translates our confused and mix-up thoughts and words into what our heart is trying to express. I find that I need to go back to worship and reconnect with the Holy Spirit who will lead me into all truth and or repentance (if necessary) and mend the emotional disconnect.
Why wouldn’t the One who loves you most not want you to share your innermost thoughts and concerns? “Come unto Me all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.” Matt.11:28 KJ
When His love is revealed, the words we offer aren’t as important as the intimacy of our relationship.

Having a fun evening doesn’t always have to mean spending a lot of money. You don’t have to go out to the local club or spend some extra cash to join a party just to have tons of fun. There are some great ways to have fun in the evenings without breaking the bank and we are going to take a look at some of them in this article. Let’s get started, shall we?
A Fun Poker Night
A poker night is a classic way of having tons of fun without spending a lot of money in the process. There are two ways you can do this. First, you can host your own poker night and have friends or colleagues come over to play. You can even have a small wager just to bump the level of excitement up a notch.
Alternatively, you can spend time playing poker online. Similar to having a poker night at home, you can also set up a private poker room for your friends to join. You can set your rules on small or big bets to make the game as affordable as you want it to be. At some poker sites, you can even set your own house rules and play side games as you compete against friends for bragging rights and other rewards.
Poker is a game you can master. It is a skill-based game more than it is a luck-dependent one, so the entire evening can be very exciting indeed. Besides, who wouldn’t want to know which member of the Marketing Department is the best at poker?
Binge-Watch Your Favourite TV Series
Thanks to services like Netflix and Amazon Prime, you no longer have to rely on Cable TV – and its schedules – to watch your favourite TV shows. You don’t even have to spend time waiting for downloads to finish to have an awesome weekend binge-watching a couple of season of Marvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D or old seasons of Top Gear.
Most of the popular shows are available through these services and spending a Saturday evening at home with enough snacks and beverages while going through the latest episodes is a great way to have fun without breaking the bank. You can also have friends come over to join the fun, especially if you love the same TV shows.
Streaming services also have movies you can watch. Some of them are actually recently-released movies and popular titles. There is no shortage of entertainment to be found.
A Bingo to Remember
Bingo is a very simple game to play. It’s a cheap game to play too, plus it can be very rewarding. You don’t have to visit the local Bingo hall to play the game thanks to the wonders of the internet. Find a suitable online Bingo room and you can join the fun in just a couple of clicks.
The weekends are always filled with popular online Bingo sessions. You can choose to pursue large jackpots and be the next big Bingo winner. Alternatively, you can join in with the more underrated sessions and spend your time playing exciting side games and talking to other Bingo players in the room.
Worry that you might spend too much playing Bingo online? Well, you don’t have to. Online Bingo cards are incredibly cheap. On top of that, you can get free bonuses and free cards to play with just by signing up. To make it even better, there are even bingo rooms you can access for free, allowing you to win real cash prizes without spending a dime.
Free Concerts!
We’ve talked about several cheap ways to spend the evening at home. This next one is for those of you who still want to go out and have tons of fun on a budget. Go on Craigslist or your local event directory and find out about free concerts you can attend in the area. You’ll be surprised by how many of these free concerts are available.
Local pubs usually have live bands playing on the weekend. You still have to pay for the pint you have while you’re there, but you’re free to enjoy the entertainment. Parks and certain venues host free concerts regularly too.
You can also find charity concerts if you really want to up the excitement. Charity concerts tend to feature popular bands and artists; you can watch them by donating to the charity. Some indie movie showings and even open theatres with great movies to watch are also alternatives worth considering.
It is easy to see that there is no shortage of fun things to do, even when you’re on a very tight budget or you just don’t want to spend a lot of money during the weekend. The ideas we talked about in this article will help you get started with finding fun ways to spend the evening.Free eBook:

Minimum group size: 10Seniors: Tralee Dynamos 1 v 6 Samphires
Well done to the senior team who got back to winning ways, beating Tralee Dynamos away in a league fixture. Scorers were Peter MacCarthy, Bill Mullins, Bobby O’Regan, Sean Foley(2) and Jesse Stafford-Lacey.
U18: Samphires 1 v 1 Killarney Celtic
Our lads hosted Killarney Celtic last Saturday and conditions were great for a game of soccer. It was tight throughout with Celtic having the breeze for the first half. We probably had slightly more of the play but Celtic were set up to play on the counter. Chances were at a premium with Celtic’s best chance coming from a free on the half hour and they hit the bar but immediately we got possession of the ball and got in behind their defence but with 2 of us in on goal we managed to butcher a golden chance. In the second half it remained the same format as the first and we were caught on the counter on the hour mark with a well executed finish from a good cross from the right. We upped the tempo from there on and as the game moved towards the final whistle it got pretty frenetic. In the 92nd minute we got our reward when Cian Donnellan somehow kept a ball beyond the back post in play and in the ensuing scramble we forced an equaliser past Celtic’s excellent keeper. The scorer of the goal is unclear as a number of players are claiming they had the last touch. Well done to all involved on their display.
Under 15: Samphires 0 v 4 Rattoo Rovers
Despite the scoreline we played quite well and the team has improved hugely in the last few months under the guidance of Donnchadh MacGarry. Hopefully they will continue in this vein and if so, it won’t be long before will be pushing for honours.
U10s:
On what was our last match for the Fenit Samphire Under 10s, we finished in style playing an away blitz in Listowel. The teams involved were Listowel Celtic, Killarney Celtic, Camp, Park and of course Fenit Samphires.
U7s played a very exciting 3 matches showing off all the skills learned during the winter and playing with such skill and fun and really enjoyed their trip away. Well done to all the team who won their first game, drew their 2nd and lost their last match.
U8s played their 3 matches with confidence and to be fair they were right to be confident. They won all their three matches and played as a team with fast passing ball that opened up the defensive team all afternoon. With some great saves and accurate strikes on goal this is a team for the future.
U9s are really gelling together and in all their 3 matches proved too strong for all their opponents opening up the defensive sides with accuracy through passing of quick ball. It is a really joy for all the mentors to see this bunch of genuine kids develop into a real soccer team. They worked hard and worked together and got their rewards with excellent results.
The last get together of the season will be this coming Friday 26th May in Samphire Park for the medal ceremony at 7 pm.
We would like to sincerely thank Kevin Deady, John Quilter, John O’Carroll, Ciaran Dwyer and Lee Sugrue for looking after all the juveniles during the year. With out your dedication these teams could not have been as successful as they are.Barre Workout Home

You probably remember The Link, the ambitious project that would have renovated and added much needed space to the Three Rivers Convention Center. It would have also remodeled the aging Toyota Center, and would have been paid for by a sales tax. Now, a revamped version of the project will be in front of voters not too far down the road.
Last summer, the plan was narrowly defeated by about 2.5 percent last August in the primary, and because of that close defeat, supporters and officials want to try again. But this time, the proposal, valued at $35 million dollars, would include building a third ice rink by the Toyota Center and Arena.
In short, the Tri-Cities has exploded as a hub of youth, junior and other hockey activity. Numerous tournaments and events draw as many as 30 teams a weekend, and book well over 700 rooms, according news reports.
The new plan would accomplish the goals of The Link, but add the ice. It's needed, say Tri-City Amateur Hockey Association officials, because TRAC is considering closing it's aging ice after it's contract with the TCAHA expires end of 2018. If that happens, it would severely damage the huge hockey program in the region. It's already pressed for ice time, and more space is needed.
The Link originally called for 50,000 more square feet by joining the Three Rivers Building to the Toyota Center, refurbish much of the aging facility, and add a performing arts theater capable of seating over 3,000 people. It would attract a number of smaller events and performances.
The project would be paid for by a sales that that would add 2 cents to the cost of a purchase of $10, or 2/10ths of a percent cost increase.“Either.
Where’s the time going? I remember dying to turn 19 so that I could be legal drinking age here. I’m no longer in my 20s. How did that happen?
What are my 2
4 lessons learned in 24 years 30 lessons from 30 years?
This was post was originally published on 12/26/2011. I’m going to update this post every year on my birthday with some new random life lessons.
1. You need to slowly build towards your goals.
It doesn’t matter if you have money related goals or fitness plans. It’s all about slowly building towards them. You’re not going to accomplish everything over night. If you do a little bit of work on a consistent basis, you’ll be amazed by what you get done by the end of the year.
I try to write 1,000 words every single day. I try to hit the weights at least three times a week. Consistency is key.
2. The best time to start is right now.
Right now is the best time to get started with anything. I wanted to vagabond for the longest time. Instead of making excuses I finally bought a ticket to Poland in 2011 and learned as I went. I showed up with no clue as to what was going to happen next. I ended up having a blast all by myself in a foreign country. My friends never thought that I would do it. I even thought that I would never do it. I did it.
Right now is the very best time to start anything. It doesn’t matter what you want to do. You can start an online business now. I even launched a podcast in 2015 with a friend and it was all on-the-job-training.
3. Debt will ALWAYS bring you down.
Debt puts a stranglehold on you. It limits what you can do with your time and your money. It totally limits your options in life. You can’t travel or start your own business if you need to be making consistent debt payments.
I’m thankful to have never been in any serious debt. I’ve forgotten to pay off my credit card balance in full or borrowed money for investments to use as leverage. I’ve never been in consumer debt or school debt (because I worked like an animal in school).
I’ve seen many of my friends get stuck in debt. It’s not fun. Avoid it at all costs if you can because it will bring you down.
4. You have to get into the habit of saving money.
It doesn’t matter if you’re earning $50,000 a year or $5,000, you need to get into the habit of saving money. Every little bit that you save today will help you out massively in the future.
Even saving $20 a week can go a long way. Think about.
$20 x 52= $1,040.
Not bad. That’s a vacation right there. A few dollars a day can add up to thousands over the years.
If you keep on putting off saving money, you’re never going to get into it. It’s challenging to build a habit out of thin air as you get older. When you get older you’re just going to make more money and want to spend more money. Lifestyle inflation is a common thing. I suggest that you get into the habit of saving right now.
In 2012 I wrote about how I saved $25,000 by 25. This is a must-read for anyone struggling to save money.
5. There’s so much to do in this world.
“Life is either a daring adventure or nothing at all.” — Helen Keller
If I wanted to actually do everything that I want to do, I would have to live at least three lifetimes.
I encourage everyone reading this to get out and see what this world has to offer. You don’t have to go all out right off the bat.
Pick a place that you really want to see and plan a trip. Start saving right now.
When will you start to travel the world? You can start small like me (a week to Cuba in 2006) or move to Japan to try to become a pro wrestler.
6. Money is an amazing tool.
Money is simply a tool that gives you options for what you want to do in life. Without money, you really limit your options. Money should be treated as a tool and nothing else.
7. You need a reason for chasing after money.
Do you really want a million dollars or do you want million dollar experiences?
Going after money for the sake of money is boring. You need a passion and reason to be chasing the dollars. You need to figure out why you want the money.
8. The people in your life make it worth living.
It really is true that your network is your net worth.
Material possessions are fun to have. It’s the people in your life that make it what it is. I believe that the quality of your life is determined by those that you surround yourself with. You are the average of your circle of close friends.
9. You need to do something that matters.
You don’t have to follow your passions or write social media posts about how passionate you are about life, but it definitely helps to do something that matters. I love to help others with their money. I want you to make more money, save more money, and owe less money. I feel great knowing that I try to do something that matters.
See how Jacquelyn pay off $48k worth of debt or how Matt quit his job to build tables.
10. Working out will make you feel amazing.
I love working out. I always switch up my workouts. I go from kettle bell swings to grappling to heavy weights. I couldn’t imagine a life without training in it. Releasing endorphins and pushing yourself to the max are things that I wouldn’t want to miss out on. You don’t have to become a bodybuilder.
You can start by just busting out 50 pushups in the morning or a quick walk down the street.
11. You really do regret the things that you don’t do.
You don’t want to turn 50 and regret not giving it your all because you held yourself back.
With that being said…
12. Failure is needed.
“The answers don’t matter. At all. The choice of tools doesn’t matter ; the method doesn’t matter. You don’t need a guru ; you need experience, the best kind of experience, the experience of repeated failure.” – Seth Godin
You need to fail. Fail often. Fail hard. Don’t be afraid of failing. Be afraid of not trying. I failed many times in the past year. Remember my eBook? That was a failure. If you’re not failing then you’re not trying hard enough.
In 2012, I finally self-published my own book because I stopped worrying about failure. In 2015, I self-published four books because I stopped worrying about how the world would react.
13. Risk should be mandatory in your 20s.
Why are young people so afraid of taking chances?
It should be mandatory in your 20s to take risks. You have absolutely nothing to lose. Throw yourself out there. Take risks in relationships. Take risks with your career. Take risks with your appearance. There are so many risks worth taking that we miss out on because we’re trying to fit in.
14. The best investment is in yourself.
Whenever I hear friends debating investments, I chime in by saying that the best investment is in yourself. Stocks and real estate are great investments (I do both). However, at the end of the day, stocks are imaginary numbers and real estate is four walls.
When you invest in yourself, you’re investing into the rest of your life.
You can invest in yourself through courses, upgrades, health, and anything else that can improve your current situation. All of these investments will pay massive dividends in the future.
15. Chasing fads is harmful.
When you’re chasing the next big thing you can get yourself into deep trouble. This can be the next hot investment, new workout strategy, or even clothing. You’re never going to be satisfied. You’re always going to be chasing something. Don’t forget that fads always fade.
16. It’s okay to blow money.
It’s totally cool to blow money once in a while. If you work hard and save your money most of the time, you deserve to spend some of it.
17. Not everyone is going to understand what you’re all about.
I would like to think that my philosophy is pretty simple: work hard and play harder. If you invite me to a party you should expect me to own the night. You should also expect me to the be first one up working away on my laptop. It really is a simple way of life. I don’t believe in excuses or feeling sorry for yourself. That’s not what my life is about.
18. There’s a difference between greed and drive.
You can be driven. On the dark side, you can be greedy. I’ve crossed that line many times and I feel stupid about it.
Being driven is what keeps you up late at night and gets you up early in the morning when you’re sleep deprived and feel like complaining.
Greed is what you gets you to miss your friend’s birthday party because you would rather make some money.
19. You’ll never stop learning.
You have two ears and one mouth so that you can listen twice as much.
With that being said, you’re likely to do nothing about it. If you get anything out of this article, I hope that you try to listen more and let others talk. The world doesn’t care about your problems. Maybe one day when you’re famous you can write an autobiography where you list all of your problems.
There’s so much to learn out there. I still need to learn another language on top of the six billion other things I don’t know. The amazing part is that you can learn a little every single day. The Internet is the only resource that you need. Everything is out there. All of the information in the world is easily accessible.
20. Life will always go on.
You think that you have major problems? Imagine you had to throw your problems into a pile. Then other people in less-fortunate situations would be allowed to throw their problems into this same pile. You know what would happen? You would take your problems back in a heart beat.
No matter how big you think your problems are right now, the good news is that life will go on. The world will never stop for your problems, nor should you ever let it. Keep on living and pushing forward!
21. There’s no point in fearing death.
Confession: I’m afraid of death. Like it freaks me out. Since I was a little kid I’ve always been afraid of death. I just hate the unknown. I hate not knowing what’s next.
Many of us worry about death. We should really be concerned with not living at all. Death is inevitable. We all die. Not all of us can say that we truly lived. I need to focus more on living.
22. People can be amazing.
You never know when your friends will come through big time. There will also be times where complete strangers come through for you.
My favorite example is the one time that a stranger rang on my doorbell while I was having drinks with friends. I go to the door wondering who this random dude was. Then I noticed that he had my wallet in his hands. I was so excited earlier that I left my wallet behind while eating lunch down the street. This guy found the wallet, saw that it was a local address and brought it to my door. That saved me some serious time and money.
People can be truly amazing if you let them be.
Look no further than those that take the time to send you a birthday text message or a message on your wall. I now go out of my way to contact my friends on their birthday.
23. Money comes and goes, but time goes forever.
Time is so precious. Money will always come and go. Time goes and never comes back. Once time is gone you have no chance of getting it back. This is why I respect your time and my time. I don’t like to waste time nor do I like to spend my time on things that don’t matter. Once that time is gone I’m never going to get it back. I want to spend my time with the people that matter, living on my own terms.
24. It’s all good.
Seriously. It’s all good. Everything’s going to be alright. There’s no point in stressing out or carrying grudges. It’s all good my friends. Everything is going to be the way it’s meant to be. You don’t have to spend your days ranting and raving on social media over every issue that you read about.
25. You must meet your obligations.
The key to success in your 20s is to always meet your obligations — financial and personal.
This means that you must pay off your student credit cards and show up when you say you’re going to show up.
I don’t believe in calling in sick or flopping on anyone, EVER! I believe in being a classy person in this regard. No matter how stupid I get in other areas of life, I’ll always meet my obligations.
If you ever can’t make a payment or a meeting, you must notify the person. If you borrow money from someone, keep them updated. If you make plans, keep them! If an emergency comes up, then take the time to contact that person. Do NOT ever just disappear. Your friends deserve to be updated. I promise you guys that I’ll never bail on this blog or on any commitment that I make. If I can’t make a commitment, then I simply state this.
26. You’ll never be totally ready. Just do it now.
The theme for 2013 was all about doing things that I wasn’t ready for.
The examples include:
- Running a half-marathon with no training.
- Going to Argentina by myself.
- Having my first pro wrestling match.
I wasn’t ready for any of these. I just went. It’s easy to create excuses. Sometimes you just have to test yourself to see what you’re really made of.
27. Always shoot for the stars.

“What the hell did I get myself into?”
I asked myself this question many times in 2014. Some of the times I asked myself this include:
- Before every single pro wrestling show. How could I possibly go out half-naked in front of all of those people?
- Before my salsa classes. What would they say about me?
- Before entering a grappling tournament. What if I got injured?
Long story short: shoot for the stars and don’t let anyone or anything get in your way.
28. The timing will never be perfect. You just have to show up.
I really learned about this in 2015 by forcing myself to become more accountable. I had to launch when I wasn’t ready (books, podcasts, articles, etc.) and show up even when I didn’t want to.
When there’s a meme made after you, then you really have to deliver. I’ve come to accept that everything will be on-the-job-training for me. I thank you all for supporting my ventures. It’s easy to bet on the sure thing and very few will put money on the long shot.
29. Take any excuse to have fun with friends.
These are usually positive, but in 2016 had to deal with the sudden passing of a good friend (Pete The Greek). It opened my eyes to something I’ve already believed in. You should always take every opportunity to have fun with your friends. We’re living in the best time period in history and it would be a shame to not take advantage of it. Get your work done first and then go have fun with your friends. This doesn’t mean that you have to party every weekend. You can save up for new experiences (UFC event, hockey game, mini-golfing, kayaking, axe throwing, etc.). Don’t be one of those people who always brags about being “too busy” for everything. That’s just lame. You can find time for everything.
30. Don’t let negative people bring you down.
.” — Robert Greene
Do you have friends that are always pessimistic and negative about everything? Do you have people in your life bringing you down?
Avoid them at all costs. Find new friends. Don’t let anyone bring you down. Don’t hang around toxic people. Life’s too short to associate with anyone that’s going to get in your way.

Those are my 30 completely random life lessons that I’ve picked up. Share some of your lessons.
“I don’t know where I’m going from here, but I promise it won’t be boring.” — David Bowie
“The best time to start is right now” is one of my favorite quotes, actually. So true. I agree with so many more of these, too.
There’s never going to be a better time than right now. I started this very blog on November 7th in 2008 because it was a Friday evening and I had time to kill. I would normally work or something prior to going out. On this evening I had no shift.
When I didn’t have a shift I would normally complain about it or sit around at home. This time I did something different. I went on doughroller.net, then to bluehost, and I finally purchased my own domain.
I found the theme possible (in hindsight), and started writing articles. If I never took action that Friday evening, I would never have started Studenomics.
Great post. I am ashamed to admit that I nearly unsubscribed to your blog, because it seems that many of your posts have been about crushing credit. While it IS an important topic to discuss, fortunately, debt isn’t an issue for me. However, this post reminded me of what great insight you have, how you communicate on the same level as your readers, and made me think about the unique (and humorous) way you have of approaching some topics you’ve covered. Perfect example: When you linked getting laid to personal finance. I’m staying subscribed, and I’m printing this post out to hang on my wall. Keep it up, man. Many would benefit if they read your blog. Cheers from Canada!
I also think “the best time to start is right now” is the best advice ever. Nothing ever is accomplished by putting it off, right? The only reason you or I are known bloggers is that we started and kept going, lol. 😀
Right now is the best time to start. I had my first pro wrestling match last week without being ready at all. You will never be fully ready. Just go.Mapserver oracle

We found a house in a small town not far from the gates of Ft Rucker. I love the neighborhood! I'm still in the process of making this house a home. Brooklyn is getting used to being so far away from family. Not that she likes it, but she understands more now.
We already drove back to Missouri once to surprise my mom. I didn't tell anybody that Brooklyn and I were coming home. I even talked to mom a couple of times on the drive home and she thought we were shopping. It was about 10 when we finally made it to the house and with the help of my youngest sister, we snuck in and went to sleep in her room. The next morning mom still had no idea we were in my sisters bed, so she yelled for mom to come in the room. After a few minutes of waiting anxiously, mom opened the door and just stood there for a while trying to figure out who we were. Then she started hollering and said am i dreaming? what is going on? She couldn't believe it, i'm glad we actually pulled that off. It was a nice surprise.
Josh bought a new boat while Brooklyn and I were visiting back home. We shouldn't leave him home alone for too long or this is what happens!Alternative Career Education High School (Closed 2004)

Here is a little story: Once upon a time, 15 years ago, DPRP was just a five-year-old web-sapling and I had just skidded through my third decade. Then one day a kindly doctor hovered over my hospital bed and uttered the dreaded C-word. A tumour, the size of fist, had staked its claim to the middle of my chest. The doctor kindly gave me a 50:50 chance of ever skidding through a fourth decade.
After a year's worth of chemotherapy and a weekly exposure of my chest to a kindly radio-therapy nurse, I was bald but bold. I made a list of 10 bands I wanted to see before I died - be that sooner or later. Within a year I was in remission and had travelled to Progpower USA, the south of Spain, Netherlands, Sweden Rock Festival, Paris and London and struck nine off that list (including the legendary ARK which I'd thought was being overly optimistic). One band however was proving problematic.
Vanden Plas had been on the bill for my trip to ProgPower USA, but pulled out due to safety concerns following 9/11. I had also travelled to see them in Paris, only to arrive to find a note saying they had had to cancel due to the sudden death of singer Andy Kuntz's father.
Undeterred, a year later I was back in Paris, to emotionally cross the final band name off my list. I cried a lot at the end of my mini-odyssey, especially during the already emotional Healing Tree, where Andy Kuntz dedicated the song to his father and apologised for not turning up the previous year, and the whole hall burst into a warm and lengthy round of applause in solidarity.
Thankfully I am now skidding through my fifth decade. With my wife I am working through a new list: 50 Great Walks To Do Before You Die. And when I do reach my Far Off Grace, this is one album I hope someone has put into the jukebox!
From the DPRP archives read the original review by Mark Sanders from 2000 and then Andy's review of the reissued version from 2004

31: HANDS – Strangelet (2008)
I had never heard of Hands until a couple of years ago, when my good friend Dave (who is also an excellent musician in his own right) sent me a copy of their 2008 album, Strangelet. Incidentally, they had performed at the 2006 edition of ProgDay just a few weeks before my first trip to the US, when I finally met my husband-to-be in person.
Based in Texas, where they were formed back in 1977, Hands have never enjoyed as high a profile as other veteran US prog outfits. In the light of the excellence revealed by Strangelet and its follow-up, the recently-released Caviar Bobsled, that is a real shame.
This album comes with four bonus tracks (in addition to the original seven), which include the stunning instrumental Zenith of Mars, a showcase for Mark Cook (also known for his tenure in Herd of Instinct and Spoke of Shadows), whose Warr guitar creates utterly entrancing atmospheres. All in all, Hands’ uniquely eclectic take on progressive rock is likely to appeal to most prog fans, regardless of their affiliation.

2And supper taking place, the devil having already put it into the heart of Yehuḏah from Qerioth, son of Shim‛on, to deliver Him up,
3יהושע, knowing that the Father had given all into His hands, and that He had come from Elohim and was going to Elohim,
4rose from supper and laid aside His garments, and having taken a towel, He girded Himself.
5After that He put water into a basin and began to wash the feet of the taught ones, and to wipe them with the towel with which He was girded.
6And so He came to Shim‛on Kĕpha, and he said to Him, “Master, do You wash my feet?”
7יהושע answered and said to him, “You do not know what I am doing now, but you shall know after this.”
8Kĕpha said to Him, “By no means shall You wash my feet, ever!” יהושע answered him, “If I do not wash you, you have no part with Me.”
9Shim‛on Kĕpha said to Him, “Master, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head!”
10יהושע said to him, “He who has had a bath does not need to wash, except his feet, but is clean altogether. And you are clean, but not all of you.”
11For He knew who would deliver Him up, so He said, “You are not all clean.”
12When יהושע had said this He was troubled in spirit, and witnessed and said, “Truly, truly, I say to you, one of you shall deliver Me up.”
22The taught ones looked at one another, doubting of whom He spoke.
23And one of His taught ones, whom יהושע loved, was reclining on the bosom of יהושע.
24Shim‛on Kĕpha then motioned to him to ask who it was of whom He spoke.
25And leaning back on the breast of יהושע he said to Him, “Master, who is it?”
26יהושע answered, “It is he to whom I shall give a piece of bread when I have dipped it.” And having dipped the bread, He gave it to Yehuḏah from Qerioth, son of Shim‛on.
27And after the piece of bread, Satan entered into him. יהושע, therefore, said to him, “What you do, do quickly.”
28But no one at the table knew why He said this to him,
29for some were supposing, because Yehuḏah had the bag, that יהושע was saying to him, “Buy what we need for the festival,” or that he should give somewhat to the poor.

The most reliable fish at this time of year are luderick.
Fortunately they will take cabbage weed, being primarily ocean blackfish, as opposed to the smaller river luderick who prefer the often hard to obtain river weed. Unfortunately with all the bad weather we have had this winter, cabbage weed has been sparse as the big swell smashes it off the rocks. With a bit more effort though cabbage can be found on most ocean rock platforms. You'll need a bucket of sand as well, which is mixed with some chopped cabbage weed and used for burly.
Blackfish are possibly one of the most reliable species found in Sydney Harbour. They can be successfully targeted all year round but we tend chase them more in winter as our focus in summer is kings. They are found throughout the system from the heads right through the freshwater reaches. I've even seen them in pure fresh water in the head waters of Middle Harbour.
Although they are obviously exactly the same species, blackfish often get categorised into river blackfish and ocean blackfish.
River blackfish are generally smaller, darker fish found in the upper reaches of the harbour. They usually don't exceed about half a kilo and therefore require a scaling down in tackle compared to that used to catch their much larger ocean brothers.
Rods still need to be long but are of lighter construction. There are a couple of reasons for the long rods used for blackfish the main ones being that they are required to lift the belly of line that often forms between the rod tip and the float. The other is to cushion against the fishes numerous powerful lunges and avoid pulling the tiny hooks used for blackfish, from their small mouths.
Quill floats are far more efficient than the heavy, long stemmed floats used for the ocean fish.
A number 10 or 8 Mustad sneck hook, in green, completes the rig.
River weed, which is the hair like weed found in the brackish reaches, is the preferred bait for river blackfish.
Some of the better spots in the Harbour include; Greenwich, Long nose Point, lane Cove River, blues Pt, Balls head, valentia St wharf and the wall near luna park. In Middle Harbour; Roseville, Killarney pt, Spit Bridge and Beauty Pt are the pick of the spots.
The lower harbour has a number of spots that attract some superb quality ocean Blackfish.
These fish are in the same class as the fish you would expect to find off the ocean rocks. They are of a good average size at around the kilo mark and are much lighter in colour with prominent bands running down their body. They are found in much rougher country so accordingly the tackle must be scaled up a bit.
Rods are slightly heavier in the but section and four or five kg line is more appropriate. The heavier, long stemmed floats are used and a no. 8 or 6 hook is more suited to these larger fish.
The other main difference between these ocean fish and the river fish is the bait. Cabbage weed commonly found on the ocean rocks grows in abundance on the lower reaches of the harbour and is therefore the obvious bait.
You'll have to gather your cabbage from the ocean platforms though, as taking anything from the intertidal zone of Sydney Harbour is prohibited.
A Burley consisting of chopped weed and sand is a big advantage for both river and ocean fishing.
The tricky bit to blackfish fishing is in the control of the rig. Light floats, long drops, wind resistant baits and lots of sinkers add up to a rig that demands constant attention. There's two ways to go and they both have their good and bad points.
You can opt for the running float rig. This consists of a standard long stemmed blackfish float that is free to run on the line. It's stopped a certain distance from the hook by a split shot and stopped from running all the way up the line by a 'stopper'. The 'stopper ‘can be a piece of light string tied to the line or any one of a number of commercially produced rubber 'stoppers'. The main criteria for a stopper is that it clamps tightly enough to the main line to stop the float sliding any further than you want it to , but still must be loose enough that it can be moved up or down in order to change the depth of the drop. It must also be able to be wound through the runners, sometimes even onto the reel and cast back out again without snagging. The main advantages of this rig is that the length of the drop from the rod tip can be as short as a couple of feet and the maximum depth of the drop below the float is infinite. This makes it an easy rig to cast and can be cast further than the alternative. The disadvantage is that it is prone to tangling due to the fact that the wind resistant bait is very close to the float during the cast. It's at let's say ten feet or more you will have that full ten feet twelve feet then this rig is not applicable, but this does not occur very often.
Weighting of the float is critical. Most floats consist of a thin stem with a stream lined float of either.
Whether conditions dictate the size and weight of the float you will use. In windy rough conditions you will need a big heavy float and in calm conditions the smaller the float the better. A quill float makes an ideal still water float.
The choice of reel is up to you. I've seen egg-beaters, baitcasters and center pins used successfully. Centerpins are still used on a traditional basis rather than on their practicality. If you opt for a centerpin then go for a side cast such as those made by Alvey. I use egg beaters as they offer open face casting, a fast retrieve which is important when picking up 'belly' before striking and the ability to feed line smoothly to the float to allow it to drift.
They are a top eating fish if they are bled, iced, filleted and skinned. Don't forget to remove the black lining from the stomach. Architect

Click Image to Enlarge
For my card today, I've used the Bugaboo Stamps image called Sick Girl. I think it's never a bad idea to keep a few 'get well' cards handy, especially moving into the cold months of winter! I wasn't sure what I thought of this image when I first saw it, but I really wanted to bring it to life, and practiced a lot of my PSE techniques for shadows when I colored her in.
We'd love to have you play along with the challenge, and hope that this sketch provides you the inspiration you need!
That's it from me today! Thanks for stopping by.........please stay a while longer, and browse! :0) If you like what I do, why not consider following me? ========== > >
Now it's your turn to make the sketch shine! Whip up your project and head on over to enter it into the Mr. Linky! got bit by that cold bug that's been going around, so I smiled when I saw your post! That image is super cute and I love your coloring with PSE!
Love your take on that sketch, Cheryl ! My nose feels just like hers right now -- all sniffles and sneezes. :-D

Cobra
$54,995
PROBUILT CONTEMPORARY COBRA, 427 SIDE-OILER, TOPLOADER 4-SPEED, JAGUAR REAR!!
Not all Cobra replicas are created equal. Take, for example, this Contemporary Cobra, which is widely regarded as one of the most accurate Cobra replicas you can buy, from the round-tube chassis to the exacting proportions of the body. And if you add a 427 side-oiler like the one in this car, you'll end up with a car that very realistically duplicates the original in all the important ways, including the insane performance.
Even basic white paint looks sinister when it's wrapped around the luscious curves of a Cobra roadster. Although it's fiberglass, the detailing on this one is extremely compelling, particularly the hood with its exposed rivets and functional hood scoop. Finish quality is exceptionally good, and despite being built in 1988, this car has seemingly spent most of its life in a bubble, securely stored in a near-perfect environment. As a result, the pearl white paint has an awesome glow that's tough to capture in the studio but looks awesome out in the sunlight. Detailing is, of course, exacting, from the frame-mounted chrome roll bar for the driver to the bumperettes fore and aft to the butch-looking flat black side pipes that look race-ready. And, of course, there's a real sense of pride in driving a Cobra with '427' badges on the side that aren't just for show.
The impressive authenticity continues inside with beautiful blue leather buckets that wrap around and hug you in place and matching door panels with map pockets made of the same fragrant hides. That handsome steering wheel accurately re-creates the original and correct Smiths gauges add to the 1965 look and feel. This Cobra does just fine without a radio, thank you very much, with the side pipes providing all the stereo you'll need when you're hammering the throttle. The forward-canted shifter links to a 4-speed Toploader and the sound of that transmission alone will make gearheads swoon. Simpson race harnesses are not only a good idea for safety but also help hold you in place during aggressive driving and there are beautifully finished carpets that belie this car's racing heritage. A bare trunk doesn't offer much for show but it's big enough to make the Cobra at least a little practical.
Really, if you're going to build a Cobra, why not put an authentic motor in it? The 427 side-oiler in this car cranks out some fairly serious horsepower thanks to a pair of Holley double-pumpers on top of a medium-rise intake and a set of Edelbrock Performer heads. Finned aluminum valve covers and a correct expansion tank add to the vintage look, and this sucker bucks, snarls, and cackles like the real thing. There's a lot of vintage-looking under the hood that adds an authentic vibe to the entire presentation, and with an MSD ignition system and aluminum radiator, it doesn't seem to mind slogging through traffic. The aforementioned Toploader 4-speed feeds a trick Jaguar rear end complete with and inboard disc brakes, while the front suspension is made up of elegant aluminum A-arms that are works of art all by themselves. For safety, there are big Wilwood disc brakes at all four corners and coil-overs holding everything up. Pin-drive Halibrand wheels look just like the originals and wear fat Hankook radials that do a pretty good job of making it sit right.
Highly accurate and beautifully finished, this fantastic Cobra cost a fortune to build. If you appreciate that level of commitment and detail, then this is the Cobra you should put in your garage. Call now!

The crack of the bat is no longer the national pastime’s soundtrack. The sport moves its hips and struts its feet to hip-hop, Christian rock, country and even Sir-Mix-A-Lot.
It is, of course, the batter walk-up song. No one is exactly sure when it started, though Rockies first baseman Jason Giambi pegs its origins around 1997. That’s when he and Oakland teammate Matt Stairs let the batboys choose their intros. Stairs got “Stone Cold” Steve Austin’s entrance riff. Giambi landed “The Wolfpack Theme” from N.W.O.
“I love the howl at the beginning of it,” Giambi said. “It works well at Coors Field, and there was a great sound system at the (Oakland) Coliseum.”
When it comes to the batter’s box, the game has changed. It’s more about PitBull than Danny Tartabull. How else do you explain how White Sox infielder Gordon Beckham is known for The Outfield’s “Your Love”?
Many fans are just as interested in a player’s favorite notes as his hits. The walk-up song has become as much a part of the experience as sunflower seeds.
Tulo aims for young fans
“I remember when I got traded from the Cubs, I thought, ‘no more organ for my music,’ ” Rockies outfielder Tyler Colvin said.
Making the music choices interesting are the stories behind them. Some make deep connections to the songs, others love the beat, and then there are guys like Kaz Matsui who walk backward into a perfect fit. No, he’d never heard of Run DMC’s “It’s Tricky,” but it worked like magic during the Rockies’ 2007 season World Series run.
“It can take your mind off baseball so maybe you don’t get so caught up in the moment,” Troy Tulowitzki said. “For me, it’s a kind of a fun thing to connect to the fans. Some people are going to love it. Some people are going to hate it.”
Tulo reached a younger demographic with his choices over the past few years, and received plenty of blowback. He went with Miley Cyrus’ “Party in the U.S.A,” followed by Justin Bieber’s “Baby.” He wanted young kids in the Coors Field crowd to recognize a song from the radio. Needling his teammates was an added bonus.
“His was one I didn’t like. Every time I was on base, I heard it. I don’t know any song that Bieber sings, but I know that one, ‘Baby, Baby’ … Ugggh,” Carlos Gonzalez said.
Tulo involved fans, allowing them to initially pick his 2011 song through a Denver Post poll. They overwhelmingly chose Katy Perry’s “Firework.” It was a dud. Tulo went 0-for-8 in the first two games and promptly switched to Bieber, which brought a home run.
“I wasn’t changing after that,” he said.
Rockies outfielder Michael Cuddyer did something similar last season in Minnesota. He worked with a local country music station, letting listeners pick his tune (Christian Kane’s “The House Rules”). This season he went a different route, taking to iTunes for dance hits. Cuddyer walks up to “Kyoto” by Skrillex; “I Can’t Stop” by Flux Pavilion and “Mind Your Manners” from Chiddy Bang.
“I wanted something that would pump me up,” Cuddyer said. “And these three all brought a smile to my face.”
Former Rockie Juan Pierre had the best reason for choosing Jay-Z and Beyonce’s “Deja Vu.” He was featured in the lyrics.
“I couldn’t believe it when I first heard it,” he said.
Closers’ tunes awesome
The offseason allows time for players to become amateur DJs. That’s when they listen for a potential walk-up hit. Most like something a little loud, either with bass or a guitar. Nobody wants Air Supply sucking the oxygen out of the stadium (though Larry Walker briefly switched from Ozzy Osbourne’s “Crazy Train” to REO Speedwagon’s “Time for Me to Fly” with disastrous results).
Rockies third baseman Chris Nelson settled on DMX’s “What’s My Name?” this season. It was inspired by his childhood, even if the choice required creativity.
“I had to edit out about three minutes and 48 seconds to make it work,” Nelson said. “It was something that I would listen to with my brothers. I would sneak into their room. I hear my song loud and clear when I am out there.”
There’s some irony that given all the different tunes players have chosen, few have stuck. Among Rockies, Walker’s “Crazy Train” was arguably the most memorable. Ryan Spilborghs had the crowd briefly singing along to Gwen Stefani’s “Sweet Escape.” But even he switched, admitting, “I didn’t want to be known as the Woo-Hoo guy.”
Closers’ intros leave the most lasting imprint. Trevor Hoffman’s jog into the game to AC/DC’s “Hells Bells” in San Diego was straight out of a Hollywood horror flick. And Eric Gagne created fear and losing in opponents as he rambled out of the Dodgers’ bullpen to Guns N’ Roses “Welcome to The Jungle” during his record 84 consecutive-save streak. To this day, Gagne still gets goosebumps when he hears it, recalling images of the scoreboard flashing “Game Over” before he even threw a pitch.
It was the perfect marriage of music, mayhem and the national pastime.
“It’s not like I have it on my Walkman or what do you call those things, iPods? But what I remember is the anticipation of the crowd,” said Rockies manager Jim Tracy, who was the Dodgers’ boss then. “People used to think of Dodger Stadium and the taillights of those leaving early. Not with Gagne. When that song came on, and he came out, it was something else.”

FL - Danielle Santangelo, 34, found murdered, DeLand, 8 Nov 2010
Such a tragic story - I'd been following reports of her missing for days...then saw this early this morning...so sad - she was taking care of her mother who has cancer.
Danielle Santangelo put an ad in a weekly publication calling herself the "Girlfriend next door" and the man who responded slashed her throat, Volusia County sheriff's investigators said Thursday.
Santangelo's body was found in the back seat of her mother's red Chrysler Sebring, stashed in a wooded area south of DeLand at Darchelle Court and Cherry Street. Her neck had been cut.
Sheriff's detectives arrested Willie Hicks, 32, an unemployed Volusia County man late Wednesday and charged him with first-degree murder in the death of the 34-year-old Port Orange woman.
Investigators said Santangelo placed an ad in The Pennysaver. It read: "Girlfriend next door. Beautiful. Young Italian. Very classy. Call anytime 24/7," and then she listed her telephone number, said Volusia County sheriff's spokesman Brandon Haught.
Hicks responded to the ad a day or two before Santangelo's disappearance on Monday. Investigators do not know what day the two first talked on the telephone but it's believed they met in person for the first time on Monday, Haught said.
much know the poor lady is dead and so sad.... but what she wrote in her ad has me scratching my head (not referring to the phone number). Good example of why placing and answering personal ads is risky. Before I get slammed - I apologize if anyone is offended.
-
It is always dangerous to place personal ads and give out too much information or meet anyone in other than a public place...it is sad that Danielle felt she needed to do this, to meet a man. Her poor family...thank God they have the suspect...Just my opinion, of course.
-
Hicks's mom and sister are a real joy. "My son didn't kill anybody. All he'll do is whip your a*s, but he won't kill anybody" to the sister saying he wouldn't have sat down and played cards if he had killed someone.
WTH?
Oh I do feel so sorry for Danielle's mom. Anytime I hear a grown child or teen always checked in. They always call so you don't worry, and then they don't? That just kills me because it usually turns out to be the worse.
-
From April 2011:
Willie Hicks Jr., 33, accepted a plea offer that resulted in a life sentence for the killing of Danielle Santangelo, who had advertised her services as an escort. Hicks also got another life sentence, consecutive to the first, plus 30 years for the two separate incidents of false imprisonment and rape...
Hicks had responded to the ad and they met, although Santangelo text messaged a friend about a bad feeling she had about the man who had contacted her...
Hicks never confessed, but a sample of his DNA was taken. That key piece of evidence led detectives to charge Hicks early this year with the sexual attacks of two women.

That's because for most people, gaining excess weight is the result of poor lifestyle and eating habits that are hard to break, specifically because they are habits. Breaking bad habits and replacing them with new, healthy ones doesn't happen overnight, and it takes disciple and dedication to see it through.
Three things people should keep foremost in their minds when trying to Short-Burst Diet are:
1) Losing weight is a process accomplished over time; there is no quick fix.
2) There is no one size fits all diet that works for everyone.
3) The best weight loss programs include some form of exercise to burn calories and tone muscle.
Before you start the Short Burst Diet, try to determine why you gained weight in the first place. Do you eat calorie-laden foods? Are you mostly sedentary, with few instances in your daily routine that allow you to burn calories? Does stress cause you to eat for comfort?
Identifying the cause of your excess weight will help you determine how to choose a diet. Check with your doctor so you can rule out conditions like hypothyroidism and elevated testosterone levels.
Ensure you get lots of fruits and vegetables everyday. Ripe, juicy pieces of fruit can help satisfy your sweet tooth, but are infinitely healthier than cake or candy. And many vegetables contain dietary fiber, which helps you stay fuller longer, and aid in your digestion.
Look for lean cuts of meat. Protein is essential to muscle and brain function, but fatty cuts of meat offer you too much in terms of saturated fats, which are not only higher in calories but can elevate your cholesterol levels as well.
Don't limit your calories to just three big meals a day. Eat a high protein breakfast to get your day started off properly, then eat a piece of fruit or some nuts for a mid-morning snack. A healthy lunch, followed by another mid-day snack of low-fat yogurt, or more fruit and nuts, will allow you to feel fuller longer, and prevent you from over-eating at dinner. Keep your portion sizes within reason.
Drink lots of water everyday while on hte Short-Burst Diet. It really is the only drink that will properly hydrate you.
Losing weight doesn't have to be hard, but it does take time. Don't set up unrealistic expectations, and you should eventually reach your goals.CHARLESTON, W.Va. —..Joe Henry quipped Friday night that "you know something's dead when they put it in a museum." Given he was on stage at the Getty Center's Harold M. Williams Auditorium, Henry noted that he's revising that point of view.
The singer-songwriter and his three-piece band were very much alive, with invitingly accessible music that dares to not dumb down. In fact, the literate lyrics and personalized mix of jazz elements with singer-songwriter roots both on his "Tiny Voices" album and in this concert is a matter of smarting up.
If that sounds like an aloof, intellectual exercise, it's actually quite sensual, fully realizing the jazz-adjacent approaches Henry initiated on 2001's stunning "Scar." On the new album, with such touches as jazzman Don Byron's bass clarinet, Henry creates swirls of sound comparable to Van Morrison's "Astral Weeks" or Joni Mitchell's "Hejira."
Even with the stripped-down backing trio of keyboardist Patrick Warren, bassist Jennifer Condos and drummer Jay Bellerose, the enraptured "Sold" sounded as if it could have been written for Chet Baker, while the new album's title song called to mind a never-was collaboration of Mitchell and Miles Davis. Ultimately, it's not jazz in the same way that Peter Gabriel's music is not African. There was jazz-derived telepathy in the instrumental interplay Friday, but it's not about jazz-style soloing.
It's about shaping the music around the emotional content of Henry's intimate portraits of people becoming lost in each other, or lost in themselves. Sung in a voice somewhere between Morrison and Tom Waits, the songs are simultaneously heartwarming and heartbreaking -- worthy of museum display.Ferguson Must Have an American Response
Peter Eisenstadt and Ayala Emmett
August 28 2014
Michael Brown, an unarmed 18 year old, shot and killed, his body uncovered, exposed to the sun for more than four hours–was finally laid to rest on Monday. For the last time, and finally with dignity, Michael Brown a mothers child, a fathers namesake was surrounded, embraced, and mourned by family, friends, ordinary citizens, celebrities, clergy and politicians. So many people inside the church and outside paid their respects but America, or more specifically, white America–with very few exceptions–was absent. There were no visible white clergy and no 2016 political aspirants. It seemed that the Ferguson tragedy was black Americans grief.
Yet Ferguson is really an American tragedy and must have an American Response. Geographically located in Missouri, it is a familiar American catastrophe: a policeman shooting and killing an unarmed citizen: a young black man.
For days since the killing of Michael Brown, Fergusons racism has taken on contemporary tropes; armored vehicles carrying mounted guns, battle gear, stun grenades, and tear gas. Yet, all of these are familiar forms of violent response to grief that have a long history. They are firmly rooted in slavery that etched in American collective memory the practice of treating black peoples bodies as commodities and in subsequent denial of rights; Jim Crow, lynching, and segregation. Despite the advances made by the Civil Rights Act of 1964, many forms of racism have endured; segregated neighborhoods and schools, discrimination in the workplace, in voting rights, in the incarceration of vast numbers of young black men, and the constant feeling, particularly by young men, of being guilty until proven innocent
Many of these issues are reflected in the question of police brutality. Now as in the past, disregard for life, for human dignity and for justice have corroded the social fabric. It has produced a Ferguson-like traumatized African American community in which the police are just a manifestation, albeit one with guns, that could shoot citizens with impunity yet are a part of the social fabric.
An e-mail that Ayala received from sociologist Dr. Karen Fields underscores this larger social fabric of race relation that cant be localized or neatly isolated. It’s good for people to understand that police harassment is not a faraway “there” and “them” – or that the victims are always young black men. I don’t recall if I ever told you of being followed by Brighton police (in 2000) into the driveway of the home of a psychologist with whom I was acquainted. After the woman admitted me, the officer knocked, asked if she was all right, then engaged her (and she, them!) for at least 15 minutes, while I waited inside. Seeing my state after those 15 minutes, she offered me a sugar-loaded candy…. I stood up and left as soon as I was able. It seems to me that woman had received the policing she paid for and took for granted when she moved into that nice neighborhood.
Dr. Fields writes, Back in 2011, I was stopped (with daughter Maimouna in the car) as I exited the street alongside Wal-Mart. We were fourth or fifth in line. I asked the young woman(!) what I had done wrong, and she answered, “We’ll see.” It went down from there. I made no effort to contradict her, or her older and more experienced partner. I didn’t want to push a button of police mayhem.
The message that Dr. Fields and all black parents, citizens of this country,
convey to their children is that they, the parents, much like their ancestors during slavery are unable to protect them. The media in the days of vigils in Ferguson was replete with stories by ordinary and famous African American parents about talking to their sons on how to behave when confronted by police. What got displayed in Ferguson/America in essence are an intersection of the domestic: parental helplessness, and the political: that citizenship is not the same for blacks as it is for whites.
The question of black citizenship reminds us of what Howard Thurman had to say on the subject in his crucial study, Jesus and the Disinherited (1948.) For Thurman, one of the leading religious thinkers of the 20th century, and born poor and black in the Jim Crow South in 1899, the most significant difference between Paul and Jesus was that Paul was a Roman citizen, and Jesus was not. Jesus, and his followers, were afraid every time they saw Roman authority, a centurion, a Roman soldier, knowing that they could knock them into a ditch, or worse, and they would have no recourse, no legal way to address their problems. Paul on the other hand, was proud of being a Roman citizen, and it led to a complacency in his social thinking, including his condoning of slavery. It was this fear, and the accompanying emotions, hatred, and deception, that Jesus addressed in his ministry.
The situation, Thurman argued, between 1st century CE Palestine, and America at mid-century was not that different. There is no such thing as second-class citizenship. Its an all or nothing proposition, and for almost all black people in America it was nothing. Too many black were being killed, or having their lives ruined and stunted because they were not, in any meaningful sense of the term, American citizens. Things have changed since 1948, in some ways, immeasurably for the better. But the reality, as the Ferguson events have demonstrated to everyone with eyes to see, is that, still, far too many blacks are not American citizens, in any of the ways this really matters. Real equality is still a distant goal. The police, all too often, treat blacks as second-class citizens. And, we must all insist and try to make real, there are not, and cannot be any second class citizenstIMESOCCER : Watch latest soccer highlights goals in HD, today videos, hQ.

One can attribute this phrase to academia, but it also applies to the fiction author. We are in competition with the thousands of books uploaded every week on Amazon. A book uploaded today for sale will be yesterday’s news unless we are hard at work not only writing a new book but also promoting it as what we’re working on at the present.
I’ve heard far too many authors recently talking about how you shouldn’t publish a novel more than every two years. That was the rule for decades. It takes time to write a novel, or to clean up what can only be described as a sad mess once you finish your annual NaNoWriMo madness during November. You not only need to write, revise, and edit your novel, but you also have to go through the submission process for agents and/or publishers, and then the pre-publication editing and proofreading before your book actually is ready for upload.
Okay, sounds pretty daunting, doesn’t it?
In a way, it is daunting, especially if you’re writing a series. Or several series. There are only so many hours in the day and you do have a real life that needs attention too. But the stories in our heads won’t go away. And that leads to a scheduling problem that will make the most compulsive person in the world scream in terror.
How do you manage to write so many books?
I’m asked that questions constantly, and not just by other authors. My fans also ask. My response is that I’ve been in this game for many years before I was published. Therefore, I have a huge stock of stories I’ve written—shorts, novellas, and novels—that are ready for a final polish and a query to my publisher. A little over twenty years ago, writing became my life. I learned how to work around housework, children’s activities, and a loving husband in order to pound out the stories in my head. With the children all adults now, I have a little more time, but the daily grind still presses against me, especially when I’m plotting through a difficult scene in order to make it work.
On top of all this, you, as the author, are also expected to promote your work daily on social media, to make appearances at the local library or schools, and to do your best to always be on display. Authors must always have a smile on their face and be willing to speak to total strangers about their work.
Yet, through all of this, we must also continue to pour out new tales, to contrive new scenarios, and to get that next book written far faster than any author has done in past decades. All of this is done so that our fans don’t move on to the newest author on Amazon. We want to whet their interest in our latest creation and still maintain a balance of being available.
So, yes, fiction authors are now living in a publish or perish world. We have the intense pressure of putting out new work every few months instead of every few years in order to keep people looking for our books. Yet, despite all that, I will stay with this crazy job I have, because I love it.

Figure Electrical And Electronics Industry:Arduino (Oct. 16, 1714 - March 21, 1795) was an Italian geologist, known as the father of Italian geology, who introduced the terms Primary, Secondary, Tertiary, and Quaternary in 1760 to classify four broad divisions of the Earth's rock surface, each earlier in deposition. Within each he recognized numerous minor strata, and had a clear paleontological interpretation of the age sequence of the fossil record.
The Primary order contained Paleozoic formations from the oldest, lowest basaltic rock from ancient volcanoes overlaid with metamorphic and sedimentary rocks which he saw in the Atesine Alps. He classified Mesozoic prealpine foothills as of the Secondary order, Tertiary in the subalpine hills and the Quaternary alluvial deposits in the plains.

It's that time again. Those of you who were around right before the Burning Crusade release might remember this time -- there are no new content patches before the next expansion, and we've got pretty much nothing to look forward to and nowhere to go before Wrath shows up and changes the world for good. Yes, there is a little more yet to discover at the Sunwell, but once we've seen that instance cleared out (Blizzard originally predicted about a month, and it seems like some players might be moving even faster than that), there'll be nothing left but the waiting..

Subsidizing profession progress with guild funds - Mon, 07 Apr 2008 16:30:00 EST
Lileah over on WoW LJ has an interesting idea that I've never thought of before. Well, her guild does -- she has a question about Illusion Dust, which yes, is hard to find. Usually your best bet is to run through the old level 55-60 instances, so Scholomance, Stratholme, and so on, but your best bet is probably the AH -- lots of people who can craft greens DE those and put the Dust up for sale there. Pricy but probably worth the time you'd spend grinding for them.
But the reason she's looking for Illusion Dust is because her guild is paying out a 1,000g bounty to anyone who has two leveled professions by next week. That's a super interesting idea. I'm the kind of player who never seems to find time to level my professions -- I'm too busy killing stuff and leveling and gaining reputation to run around picking up herbs or mining nodes. But 1,000 is a nice prize, and definitely helps pay for not only my time running around, but also the extra costs associated with leveling a profession -- crafting mats and so on.
And considering how useful a 375 profession is to the guild, any guild that's raiding at a fairly high level should see benefits come out of having most of the guild crafting endgame items. Very cool idea -- if you have a guild that could use a few more crafters and some gold to spread around, subsidizing profession leveling might be just the ticket.

Ten innovation lessons from Blizzard - Mon, 07 Apr 2008 14:30:00 EST
The OC Register (Blizzard's HQ -- I'm pretty sure that's where it's at, as they're not exactly open with their location info -- is located right down near them in Southern California) has a blog post up featuring 11 "innovation lessons" other companies can learn from the folks behind World of Warcraft. While the lessons aren't exactly innovative themselves (I think there are lots of companies that do this stuff, and none of them have a ten million player game), the post does provide a good look inside Blizzard's process and the thinking behind what they do.

With the dawn of Affordable Housing, Housing For All and Smart Cities Mission, demand for property is projected to multiply in the course of next few years. There is no denying in the fact that today, the realty sector of India is facing a strong cash crunch and dampened investors’ confidence. The failure of analysing real demand, improper infrastructure, saturation of Tier 1 cities, property price escalation, stringent FDI norms and absence of a regulator in the sector had caused real estate in India to hang by a thread. Thus, the projects that were launched earlier and those that are on verge of getting ready, or have delayed, has been the work without much supervision; as a result, failing to impress today’s market. Whereas, the plans of today will blossom tomorrow and it is crucial for the government to provide much needed support to revive the sector. Although, the government over the last couple of years has brought in several measures to ease the ways of conducting business in the Indian real estate sector that will help the demand to grow in near future. With the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) relaxing norms for REITs for investment in realty sector, the cash crunch problems will be answered and hopes will be high for a better demand of property in future.
Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) is a company that owns or finances income-producing real estate. Much like mutual funds, REIT provide investors with all types of regular income streams, long-term capital appreciation and diversification. This tool allows anyone to invest in portfolios of large scale properties, by way to investing in stocks. The stockholders of REIT earn from the income produced without having to own or finance a property. Recently, the Budget Session 2016-17 had announced the evasion of Dividend Distribution Tax (DDT) from the income arising out of REITs, thus making it a more lucrative deal for the investors. SEBI, on the other hand, has increased the proportion of holdings for under-construction properties. Adding further, SEBI has also proposed changes that would make it easier for eligible offshore fund managers to relocate to India, plus allowing them to register as portfolio managers or as investment advisors. “The investment cap of REITs has been increased from 10 to 20 percent for under construction projects. Indian realty sector is pretty much starving and REIT will here provide a much needed alternate route of fund raising and attract several small and medium level investors in the sector. With plans to upgrade Indian infrastructure already laid, REITs might serve as a chief instrument in years to come”, explains Vikas Pundir, CMD, SKB Group.
Also agrees Kushagr Ansal, Director of Ansal Housing, as he says, “The REITs route has been eased enormously over the last few months. Removing DDT from the income earned through REITs and now increasing the investment cap will surely boost the investors sentiments. But, with the promise of high investment and returns, comes greater risk as well. If a project gets delayed, the chances of funds getting stuck are very high. Although, RERA has now become an Act and will now look into timely completion of projects. If Single Window Clearance System gets operational Pan-India, investors will feel more secured while investing with a long term vision.”
Indian residential real estate sector has plans to deliver over 7,50,000 units in the next 4-5 years with commercial real estate quickly gaining momentum as well. Thus, there are a wide variety of options available for investors along with a huge scope of returns. “At present, there is almost 250 million sq. ft. of office space that is eligible for REITs and if even 50 percent of these get listed, there will be a total REIT listing of around Rs. 1,34,000 crores. InvITs have also started to make rounds with SEBI recently approving two out of the four applications for the same. Infrastructure in India is soon to take a giant leap with lots of funds allocated for Smart cities mission and Housing for all. With so much real estate in pipeline, REITs will perform successfully”, avers Ankit Aggarwal, CMD, Devika Group.
“REIT is a concept which has been followed by several countries abroad, more particularly in the realty sector. Considering the results of REIT in those countries, even Indian government has introduced it here. REITs are to work under the control of SEBI which earlier had some tough regulations. However, now allowing the investments in under-construction projects, it will prove to be a game-changer. Also, SEBI has removed the restrictions on SPVs, who are now allowed to invest in the holding & assets of any other SPVs. Therefore, the realty fraternity definitely welcomes this step and hopes that it will boost the sector’s pace in near future”, elucidates Ashwani Prakash, Executive Director, Paramount Group. Like REITs, Infrastructural Investment Trust (InvIT) is much like mutual funds, that enables direct investments of small amounts of money from individuals or institutional investors with a promise of small amounts of returns. Even InvITs is rapidly gaining momentum with several institutional investors showing keen interest.
Concluding on the chapter and elaborating on how REITs and InvITs will shape up the Indian realty sector’s future, Vikas Bhasin, MD of Saya Group says, “The government is leaving no stones unturned to pick up the country’s realty sector and present it on the global map. Easing ways of doing business, attracting FDI and appointing instruments such as InvIT and REIT to boost the cash flow in the sector are a proof of the eagerness shown by the government towards this sector’s success. It is evident that there is a massive fund crunch in the sector with projects getting delayed; and to fight it out, government is working in two ways; boosting investors’ confidence by making entry’s and exit’s easy and bringing policy reforms to enhance transparency. Once REITs and InvITs become fully operational, this sector won’t remain cash starved, plus offer returns to the investors, better then any other country due to the large scale production that is present here.”“Friends.About 40 new state laws and amendments went into effect on Monday.

Courtesy of Friends of the QueensWay
By Michael V. Cusenza
The design phase of the first half-mile of the proposed QueensWay Park will be getting underway this summer, Friends of the QueensWay and the Trust for Public Land announced last Thursday..
Plans call for the 47-acre park to include a bike, jogging and walking path, upgrades for the facilities of local Little Leagues, schools, community and cultural comforts; and promises “a significant improvement to the environment and quality of life of those living in Central and Southern Queens.”.
“I am excited to see that we are now ready to start the design phase of the first part of the QueensWay project,” said Assemblyman Andrew Hevesi (D-Forest Hills). .”
More than $1 million from public and private sources has been raised for the project, including a $444,000 grant from the State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation and Governor Cuomo’s Regional Economic Development Council; $250,000 from Hevesi; and $250,000 from City Councilwoman Karen Koslowitz (D-Forest Hills).
Recent contributors to the QueensWay include The Tiger Baron Foundation, The Scherman Foundation, The New York Community Trust, Altman Foundation, and Lily Auchincloss Foundation, Inc., according to Friends of the QueensWay.
The design process will be led by Susannah Drake at DLANDstudio Architecture & Landscape Architecture. The design process will involve experts in engineering and environmental sciences, and will provide many opportunities for the community to engage, Friends of the QueensWay promised.
“The QueensWay represents a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to improve the quality-of-life of Queens residents and provide a helpful boost to many of the Borough’s incredible businesses,” said Thomas.”
Supporters of the QueensWay are urging the City to allocate the necessary funds to complete Phase 1.

The Statement about the definition of a democracy is from a U.S. government tech manual from 1928 as stated. I have had a degree in government since 1967 from St. Michael's college and was personal protection for a MOH awarded Chaplain for action during the 1968 Tet Offensive. I was subsequently assigned to Walter Reed Army Medical Center as a Chaplain's Assistant again and worked the 30 wards (combat traumatic amputees) and also presented the flag to bereaved families as the Chaplain read the Letter of Condolence from the DOD.I had the unfortunate duty as well to deal directly with a number of congress cretins who took their care at Walter Reed and , rest assured: It was a revelation!. I have been a hard conservative ever since and a strict Constitutionalist , having put my money and personal health at severe risk as a matter of my CITIZENSHIP. Most in Washington are concerned ONLY with themselves or their party agendas and rarely if ever, pay much attention to their constituents' wants , needs or preferences. That was my heartfelt conclusion after dealing for 18 consecutive months with them. I see no reason to change that assessment as their proclivities for self aggrandizement and a refusal to compromise for the benefit of AMERICAN CITIZENS is quite apparent if one is honest enough to look at the reality, which too many are not. We are paying the price for THAT lack of vigilance and our failure to hold them either responsible or accountable and, that will continue unless the new Congress can begin a return to CONSTITUTIONAL CMPLIANCE UNDER THE RULE OF LAW, so long absent from a government gone rogue. God help, us all and our progeny who, if we cannot turn things around, will suffer incredibly and it is a legacy I would do anything NOT to leave them. Let us hope we can, somehow

That definition of democracy was stated as policy by the U,.S. Government in 1928. It was written when we still HAD a Constitutional Republic which worked because the Constitution was ADHERED TO most of the time. The abuses allowed by a criminally complicit congress MUST eventually lead to a confrontation and we are being deliberately divided from within by the enemies within who are as legion as those from outside simply because they have been allowed to invade us through inequitable or totally lacking ENFORCEMENT of existing American Laws by those in BOTH parties. RINOS are counterfeit democrats and THAT is the problem. True conservatives are the only hope for the country and I wish I were younger for what I fear is coming but, while there is no organized resistance as yet, I am prepared to do whatever I can to Protect and preserve all I have and all that let me have it. I will be neither victimized nor intimidated by swamp things like those who fail to exhibit any sense of decorum. Their idiocy speaks for itself and you KNOW who they are . If they are ignored for a long enough period of time and we are not baited into continuing responses, they will go away from sheer boredom: AND INHERENT COWARDICE. And, the applause you seem to be hearing issues from a relative few , hopefully to become by shunning, the sound of silence.

We didn’t have any rocket alerts, but apparently Israel is using concussion bombs, collapsing the tunnels that were built on the border of Gaza. I feel it and, it doesn’t help me sleep – for some reason.
I am noticing a new thing about myself in the midst of all of this fun and games. I don’t want to have anything to do with people who aren’t in the middle of all of this with me. I feel I have nothing in common with them, they annoy me. Friends call to see how I am and just want to hang up on them. I appreciate the consideration, but you see, you don’t get it. You can’t get it and I can’t explain it to you and I don’t have the energy to try because I need it all to keep going.
So I try not to be short tempered, I try not to be curt, and I try to get the *f* out of the conversations as quickly as possible because I just can’t cope. I want to say things like ‘if you aren’t helping then leave me alone,’ only, they are trying to help and it really isn’t like there is anything they can do.
But – I need to reserve my energy for the next tseva adom, for the next life-or-death decision of whether to drive out into the big scary world to buy a computer screen or some cables or some ground beef. I need to try and be present for my kids, who need something to lean on in the worst way in the middle of this. Not small children, barukh hashem, but children all the same, who need their mother so they can go on functioning, and for the adults, acting like adults.
It’s not that I’m not interested in other people’s problems. In fact, people saying they have nothing to complain about compared to me annoy me terribly. I’d love to hear something going on with somebody else that I could take an interest in, and if you are genuinely distressed I’d like to be able to help. It would be a nice contrast to the impotence of just sitting here listening to the ‘boom’s.
It’s a whole lot like people who tell me that after seeing me (in the wheelchair or whatever) they feel they don’t have any problems. WTF is up with that? My being a cripple doesn’t erase your problems any more than bombs being dropped around me. So don’t talk in that stupid way. You have your problems and I have mine, and we can identify with each other, empathise with each other, and support each other through the recognition that we are all hurt and hurting human beings. Far better than you (the able-bodied, or ‘safe’ person) can ‘help’ me by looking down from your awesome heights and feeling bad for me.
*I* don’t feel bad for me. I am tired, yes, and I have a lot to be getting on with that feels more important than endlessly going through the identical conversation with concerned friends. But would I exchange my life for theirs? I don’t think so.
Being bombed sucks, and being disabled sucks and that’s a fact. But so many things suck in this world. I’ll take my problems over anyone else’s, and that is fine with me.
I do get irate, down-right purple-faced, about the b.s. media. I really hate the mis-information and the lies. Absolutely sends me. People who actually believe the stuff that they read and hear in the media annoy me as well, it’s not as if there isn’t ample proof that the stuff they put out is complete and utter nonsense. Not just about the situation here. Seriously.
Yeah, but I don’t wanna write about that anyway. I am just tired, too tired. Can’t multi-task at all. I have two people I have to call back, one who called and then I had to run for the ‘shelter’ of the middle of the house – where I ate my breakfast today. And another who called while I had two kids wanting something from me. There isn’t enough of me to go ’round. So it goes.
I am happy and grateful to be here in my wonderful home, in this wonderful and crazy country. More grateful than you can imagine that my kids are all doing as well as they are, and that I turned out to be as good a mom as I did. The odds weren’t good, I’m telling you. I feel lucky to be alive, and, while I wouldn’t choose it if anyone had given me a choice, I can see so very many ways that me being crippled has made me into a better person, wife, mother.
So that’s it from the crippled/war front today. I’m too tired even to distinguish things. Just annoyed, and impatient, and when I have a few minutes to think about it, very, very happy with how things have turned out for me.
Crazy, no?
Just remember, if someone asks you if you want to be disabled, say ‘no.’
If someone asks if you want to live in a war zone, you may have to give that one a bit more thought. Seriously.The Course finder will help you filter through our entire range of courses.

The federal government is looking for a company to build the proposed Nanisivik naval facility.
The government has issued a 'Request for Qualifications — the first step in the tendering process as it seeks a company with experience of building in the Arctic, reports CBC News.
The document estimates the cost of the construction to be $56 million, but it is not clear whether that will cover all the work, and the federal government has already budgeted more than $100 million for the facility.
The project has been fraught with setbacks since it was first announced in 2007.
Source: CBC NewsThis morning all was going well. We had a slow morning and a great brunch. Then we got some last minute vitamin D on the ferry. The cab ride to the airport was a bit crazy but we made it.
It was all down hill from there. The airport computers were being screwy and I waited for over two hours in the hot sun to get to the ticket counter. Then when I got there they gave me a hand written ticket for my bag. It just said st Thomas to Denver via Chicago. While in customs I realized I forgot my carry on at the ticket counter and had to go running back for it.
Then once on the plane the pilot told us that the scheduled 3 hour flight was going to take 5. The drunk and very stinky lady next to me was upset and made a stink, ha ha pun intended. : ) The plane had no food on it, not even to buy so we got water and more water.... To watch a movie cost $8... I paid for it just do I didn't have to deal with the drunk lady.
After a very long flight we arrived in Chicago and over half the plane had missed their connections. So off I went to stand in yet another long line. The good news was that united agreed to put us all up in a hotel and give us food vouchers.
As I expected... My bag was not with me in Chicago. I waited in another long line to find out that yes indeed my bag was not here. United was kind enough to give me a toothbrush and toothpaste and off I went to Stand another line for a shuttle to the hotel. Are you seeing a trend yet? Oh and by now its after 10pm.
The hotel was nice, double tree by Hilton. Apparently this happens so frequently that the restaurant had a separate menu that had prices that matched the prices of the food vouchers from United. I ate quickly and headed off to bed... Afterall I had to be up in 5 hours to go catch my next flight.
The next morning went fairly smoothly: up at 5, shuttle to airport, intense security and economy plus seat. The lady next to me was still drunk from the night before (different lady than first flight). What's up with me sitting next to drunk people??? The flight was super bumpy but I was able to sleep through most of it.
In a shocking turn of events... My bag was one of the first off in denver. I was shocked!! Now I'm waiting for my hubby and matthew... I can't wait to see them both. I am also excited about see petunia soon as well. Check out the picture of my luggage tag and you'll see why I was shocked that my bag made it.
It was a fantastic vacation and the trip home was a fun adventure. I am thankful that the flight chaos was not at the beginning of my trip. And I am proud of myself that I made it through everything yesterday without getting upset or flustered... Even when the waiter at the hotel told me he had lost my credit card. : )Headline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next!
This could be important.
Ten days before Donald Trump was to officially take office as president, his choice for national security adviser, Michael Flynn, made a decision in the fight against ISIS.
According to an article on McClatchydc.com, Flynn was approached by exiting President Obama and his national security adviser Susan Rice. Obama and Rice had signed off on a Pentagon plan to recapture Raqqa, with the help of Syrian Kurdish forces.
Because of the timing, the plan wouldn’t kick into effect until after Trump had taken office, hence the reason Obama and Rice shared the plan with Flynn..
It was only after Flynn was forced to step down from his role as national security adviser that the plan was eventually approved.
Since Flynn’s ouster, he has declared as a foreign agent on behalf of Turkey, and it was revealed that he’d been paid $500,000 to be their mouthpiece in Washington..
Recent reports are that Trump has not quite gotten over the loss of Flynn. The man who filled Flynn’s role as national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, has excellent credentials, but a recent New York Times report stated that he “annoys” Trump, by trying to insert caveats when Trump is speaking with foreign leaders, and also tries to intervene and gently steer Trump back on topic.
Flynn also danced a little too close to Moscow..
That opened up the gate to speculation that Russia had a foot in the door with the Trump administration, and Flynn is one of several Trump associates subjected to scrutiny because of suspected entanglements with the Russian government.

Caller Ed KernsFootball was brought to Portugal in the second half of the 19th century by a combination of young Portuguese men educated in the English public school system and British expatriates. The first recorded match was played in Cascais in October 1888.
Organised football began to emerge in the opening decade of the 20th century, and in 1910 the first regional association – the Associação de Futebol de Lisboa – was founded. Initially this comprised only three clubs, Sport Clube Campo de Ourique, Sport Clube Império and Sport Lisboa e Benfica, but by 1912 two more local associations had been established in Portalegre and Porto.
The Federação Portuguesa de Futebol (FPF) – the national body's official name from 28 May 1926 – started life as the União Portuguesa de Futebol (UPF), being formed on 31 March 1914 on the initiative of the three regional associations. During the First World War its activities were limited to organising annual matches between representative teams from Lisbon and Porto, yet its ambitions went beyond this narrow remit. The UPF's application to join FIFA was provisionally accepted in August 1914 and formally confirmed in May 1923. The name Federação Portuguesa de Futebol was adopted shortly afterwards, and the FPF became a founder member of UEFA in 1954.
The country's first national championship took place in Lisbon and Porto in 1933. A year later a modified version of the league competition was played with FC Porto winning the inaugural title. Sporting Clube de Portugal, SL Benfica and Porto have all enjoyed great domestic success since, with their dominance being broken only by CF Os Belenenses and Boavista FC, on one occasion each.
Benfica also won back-to-back European Champion Clubs' Cups, beating FC Barcelona 3-2 in the 1961 final and Real Madrid CF 5-3 the next season. Sporting overcame MTK Budapest 1-0 in a replay to take the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1964. Porto tasted glory two decades later by lifting the 1987 European Cup, defeating FC Bayern München 2-1. The northern side also landed the UEFA Super Cup at AFC Ajax's expense, and since the millennium have collected further silverware. Their 3-2 triumph over Celtic FC in the 2002/03 UEFA Cup final directly preceded 2004 UEFA Champions League glory in a 3-0 victory over AS Monaco FC. They then won the 2010/11 UEFA Europa League, beating SC Braga 1-0 in the first European final featuring two Portuguese sides.
Portugal's national-team debut was a 3-1 friendly loss to Spain in Madrid on 18 December 1921. Their first notable achievement was to qualify for the Olympic football tournament in Amsterdam in 1928. Yet it was not until the 1966 FIFA World Cup that they flourished again. Portugal finished third in England, thanks to the scoring feats of the Mozambique-born striker Eusébio. Four of the Black Panther's nine goals came in a dramatic quarter-final against North Korea at Goodison Park.
Portugal also qualified for the World Cups of 1986, 2002, 2006, 2010 and 2014. At the tournament in Germany, the team bridged two hugely talented generations characterised by Luís Figo and Cristiano Ronaldo, both FIFA World Players of the Year. There have also been six UEFA European Championship appearances. As debutants, Portugal reached the semi-finals of EURO '84, going down 3-2 after extra time to hosts France. The 1996, 2000, 2008 and 2012 tournaments brought quarter-final, semi-final, quarter-final and semi-final finishes from the Selecção das Quinas, who also lost the final of UEFA EURO 2004 as the home team against Greece. Even so, that Portuguese EURO was considered a resounding success, with great games staged in modern stadiums and a friendly atmosphere in keeping with traditional Portuguese hospitality.
2016."Since "The Great Train Robbery" had them fainting away in the aisles, numberless films have been made about violence. Only one, to my knowledge (omitting its unforgivable musical remake), was ever made about an encyclopedia: "Ball of Fire," with Gary Cooper, Barbara Stanwyck and a cast of adorable eggheads. In the end, even that film made free with violence, albeit ingeniously delivered upon the bad guys in the service of true love and scholarship.
Now violence and the encyclopedia have occasion to intersect again, more substantially, in a three-volume, years-in-the-making "Encyclopedia of Violence in the United States," an enormous ship captained by a USC professor whose roots are more literary than criminological.
When I heard of his undertaking, I couldn't imagine where he would begin--or where he would end, so deep and unquenchable is the taproot that violence has sunk in this culture, this country, this species.
When you open Volume I--Scribner is publishing it next fall--you will see it begins at the beginning, at "A." But what a route it takes to get there.Thursday, 25 October 2012
Sleek Life's a Peach Blush | Review
Recently, my blush collection has grown out of control, but this is one of my favourites of them all (and that is saying a lot).
Yes, it's a hideous bright orange in the pan. And if you're a fan of Sleek's blushes, you'll know that they're very pigmented. Luckily this blush is incredibly sheer so instead of looking like patches of you are turning into an orange, you'll just have a nice subtle glow about you.
I use a Real Techniques Blush brush to apply it, which is perhaps not ideal. I find the brush brilliant for working with blushes which are very pigmented, because it doesn't pick up too much product, and blends nicely. As this is very sheer however, you have to put a little more effort in. This works for me though, because I use this blush when I want to look like I haven't got any on, but magically have a peachy flush to my cheeks. How sly.
While I think the colour of this would look beautiful on darker skin tones, I don't think the colour pay off is great enough. While this shows up subtly on my pale skin, I think women who are darker would really struggle to have this show up at all, which is a shame because as I said, I think the colour in the pan would look beautiful on darker skin.
I can't believe this is my first peach blush. While all of my pinks will always have a place in my heart, I think 'Life's a Peach' will have a place on my face for the foreseeable future.

The TrustBuilder TeamOn something of a whim, Hannah of Things Matter, and Diana of Part Time Monster, and I decided to read Lamb: The Gospel According to Biff, Christ’s Childhood Pal, by Christopher Moore. It would be fun, we thought, to read together and discuss the book.
So we invite you now to join us in the first installment of the Lazy Lambs Book Club (#LazyLambs on Twitter) today! If you’ve read the book, feel free to chime in with your thoughts to the questions, perhaps pose some of your own.
I like to imagine us all sitting around, perhaps enjoying a nice meal, while discussing our thoughts.
I really enjoyed this book… there were times when I was laughing out-loud on the bus. The way that Joshua and Biff were written, and their interactions, rang very true. There’s a line early on where Joseph tells Biff, “You go with Joshua. He needs a friend to teach him to be human. Then I can teach him to be a man.” (Lamb, Harper Collins ePub Edition (March 2006), page 17). And Biff takes that role seriously. They provide a great counterbalance to one another, playful banter and a true, deep, friendship.
Hannah asks:
“What are your thoughts on the subject, retelling the life of Jesus? Does it function as myth/fairy-tale retelling, satire, both/neither? Comments on the author’s success in achieving whatever you think it’s supposed to be are also welcome.”
I’ve spent a good part of my recent studies picking apart the stories which make up the Bible, learning about the variations, and reading different interpretations. I remember the Rabbi in my Intro to Judaism class talking about Midrash. He used the term somewhat loosely, to refer to a great number of explorations of the religious stories.
I find Lamb to fit into this definition quite nicely. It does retell the story of Jesus, drawing from historical research and various books of the bible (canonical and non) , but then it takes on the question of those unknown years. There are stories of Jesus as a child (The Infancy Gospel of Thomas), but there is largely a big blank between his birth and his ministry. I see this story as a way to have fun exploring the question of what might have happened in that time.
Also, as the author notes in the afterward in the version of the book I read, also to answer an “important question that I felt needed to be addressed, which is, ‘What if Jesus had known kung fu?'” (Lamb, Harper Collins ePub Edition (March 2006), page 440).
The religion geek in me adored well researched this book was. From Joshua’s scriptural quotations to the ways that Moore chose to tell some of the gospels to the general feel of life at the time. I now understand why people have been suggesting I read this book for years.
My question for the group:
“What are your thoughts about how the author explored the different cultures in the world at the time? What do you think about the cross-culture play and sending Jesus to all ends of the earth?”
I loved it. I know that it was taking some liberties, and some of it was downright silly, but I found myself really enjoying the way that Moore was able to draw on some different cultures and religions to help inform what Jesus ended up preaching. I’ve long been drawn to the similarities that appear across religions, and this was a nice way to create a sense of give a sense of connection.
Diana asked:
“In addition to new characters, like Biff and Raziel, Lamb also offers re-writings of many historical and religious figures, not just Jesus himself. Among those characters are the Virgin Mary and Mary Magdelene (Maggie), whose stories — especially Maggie’s — take up more space in Moore’s novel than in biblical writings. Discuss the depictions of the two Marys. What is their place in the story?”
Oh, the Marys… I really love the way that Maggie is portrayed. She’s so spunky! From her first introduction you know she’s a strong character. She is the perfect addition to the Joshua/Biff duo — I really missed her through the section of the book that she didn’t get to appear. I find it refreshing, too, to have more representation of women throughout this story… I wont start in on the rant about female representation in the gospels (yet…) but there is certainly a space where their stories should be given a chance to be told, and I like that Moore incorporates at least these two important characters into the story.
Be sure to visit Things Matter and Part Time Monster to see what they have to say to the questions!
#LazyLambs Book Club:
On a whim when Hannah, Diana, and I decided to read and discuss a book. Two months after the original deadline we set for themselves, all had finished reading the book and a discussion began. Thus began the #LazyLambs Book Club was born.
Join the #LazyLambs Book Club as we read another Christopher Moore book, A Dirty Job. We aim to finish reading and share our questions (so conversations can ensue) by June 27th. As we read our thoughts, favorite quotes, and comments will be shared on Twitter under #LazyLambs. We’d love to have you join our little club!

Love that you brought your religious education to the book and that it held up, research-wise. 🙂
The more I read about this book the better it sounds. I really should pick it up and give it a go.

I think that the research Moore put into the book really, really shows, and I’m glad that we got a lot more of the Marys. Like you, I missed Maggie when she was out of the book for a section, and that rarely happens with stories like this because the female characters are rarely given enough of a personality for one to miss when they’re not in.

Yep, usually you hardly notice when the woman’s missing, or worse you go “Oh thank goodness, she was so annoying.” Maggie’s absence was palpable.

I’ve thoroughly enjoyed reading your thoughts, and the views of both Hannah and Diana. I love the book club idea, especially sharing the experience with others. I’ll read A Dirty Job first so I can join you for discussions using the hashtag (I’m going to start this week), and then I’ll read Lamb. You’ve totally convinced me. I have to read this book! Thanks for sharing 😀

It’ll be great to have you join us!! 🙂
And yes, you have to read it! It’s great 🙂 And, part of the loveliness of the Lazy Lambs is we tend to meander our way to the deadlines 🙂
Thought, it’s not really laziness, but rather over-commitment… but the “over-committed Lambs” just doesn’t sound as good. 🙂

Durumin-Iya, therefore, urged Nigerians to give all necessary support and cooperation to security agencies in order to safeguard government’s installations in their localities.
He also urged them to provide the corps with vital information on the activities of vandals who sabotaged government’s efforts to make life easier for its citizens.
He commended the volunteer, Mr Gali Usman, for providing the information that led to the arrest of the suspect and promised to give him monthly stipend in order to motivate him do more.
“I also promise you that one day you will be one of us, when there is replacement or fresh recruitment.I will ensure that you are enlisted,” he pledged.
Durum in-Iya also urged officers and men of the command to put more effort at discharging their duty.
He said the command would endeavour to reduce criminal activities in the state to the barest minimum.

This, the first show of the year, got the season off to a cracking start. It may have been because last year was such a washout or because Mark Woodward, who has taken over running the show, has started to change the format or even because it was a little warmer and quite a bit drier than last year, but there seemed to be more people about. Which of course is a good thing.
The Club stand was very busy on both days with a record number of memberships signed up and a brisk trade in merchandise. But it is the social side that really matters and that is, after all what the Club is all about. A constant stream of members arrived at the stand, wanting information or just a chat and, of course, a welcome cup of tea and a seat. None of us are getting any younger and, speaking for myself, I need to be able to take the weight off the legs from time to time.
Andrew Gould our new Dorset representative and his partner Charlotte visited us and were introduced to the committee members on the stand. Andrew has been a member of his local young farmers for a number of years, comes from farming stock and has some great ideas to promote the Club in his area. I'm sure that we shall hear a lot more from him in the near future.

It was a great show, with tractors of all shapes sizes and conditions to see. Wandering round one can decide if the 'working clothes' or 'concourse' is your type of machine; or do you like a Ford truck engine grafted into an E27N or a P6 into an E1A?

The Marble Movement in Interior Design
A Little Bit about Marble The very brief history… The word “marble” originates from the Greek, marmaros, meaning “a snow white and spotless stone”. Be this as it may, marble can be found in a rainbow of colors. The use of this stone in architecture dates back thousands of years to ancient Egyptian and Mesopotamian

Turn your Bachelor pad into the perfect setting for a Romantic Dinner: Tips and Tricks for transforming you space quickly!
Making dinner reservations can not only be hectic but sometimes pretty expensive. Have you ever considered hosting your Valentine’s Day date at home? Valentine’s Day is right around the corner. Why not surprise your date by transforming your space temporarily and staying in for the evening.Step 1: If you aren’t a neat freak or a)April cannot be forced, but have to be allowed, to happen.
I was reminded of this yesterday when working with a client who is very similar to me in being what could be called an overachiever. We have been working on (notice the use of the word “working”) helping her to get more in touch with who she is authentically with limited success, and she is feeling very frustrated with herself.
There are different tools and techniques that can open the door to knowing and being more of who you are, but all these tools can do is open the door, they can’t magically make you know who you are. That part requires allowing.
It occurred to me in this session that she was trying too hard. That everything we’re taught in our culture about how to succeed does not work in this situation. It’s hard for us to grasp this idea, let alone implement it, when it has worked so well for us in the past. I am a perfect example of this, so I could easily relate to the difficulty my client was having.
We fear that if we quit trying so hard, quit striving so hard, that we are giving up. In our culture giving up is not a good thing, it’s a character flaw. We fear that if we quit trying so hard that we will lose all motivation and become a bump on a log, accomplishing nothing.
And, we fear that we will not get the outcome we want, that the only way to get what we want is to make it happen. Being able to relax and allow requires trust. Trust that we are supported by the Universe, trust that we don’t have to do it all ourselves, trust that whatever the outcome is, it is in our best interest.
Many times this urge to strive and try leads to anxiety. “Am I doing all the things I need to do to make the thing I want happen? What about all the things that are beyond my control? I must find a way to control them.”
And when we don’t get the outcome we want, or we don’t get it in the timeframe we want, we become frustrated and beat ourselves up. “I should have done this instead of that. I don’t know how to make this happen. I didn’t do enough, I didn’t try hard enough.” We are always blaming ourselves.
I don’t remember exactly when I became aware of the difference between forcing and allowing. I do know that I get reminded of it frequently, and I’m given the chance to do it differently on a regular basis.
Just this weekend I was talking with a friend about the law of attraction and manifesting. I have been very successful at manifesting money in my life without really trying. I would write an intention and then forget it about it, and magically money would appear from sources I never even imagined.
Then I read a book that had a four step process for manifesting and put I put that into practice. And nothing happened. After a few weeks and some discussion with friends, I realized that I was trying too hard. When I did what was natural for me – writing my intention and sharing it with my intention circle then forgetting about it – I saw results. When I focused on my intention every day and had a ritual around it, I didn’t get results. For me, the way described in the book led to trying too hard and it didn’t work for me. I went back to my old ways and began seeing results again.
Similarly, I have discovered through many trials and errors that I cannot force myself to feel a certain way. Being too focused on trying to create a feeling that I want – happiness comes to mind – creates the exact opposite. The only way I can feel happy is to relax and allow.
Just like helping my client get in touch with who she is authentically, there are things I can do that increase the likelihood that I will feel happy, but they don’t make me feel happy. They open the door that allows happiness to step through.
As I mentioned, I get a chance to stop forcing and begin allowing on a regular basis. A lifelong belief and the associated habits can take time to change. So I’m gentle with myself.
When I start feeling anxious or frustrated I know that I’m trying too hard and it’s time to relax a bit. I look at where I still believe that I have to make things happen or where I don’t trust that whatever the outcome may be it will be the right one.
I do the things that will open the door and welcome the outcome that I want, and then I go about my business. Whatever the outcome, I know that ultimately it will be the right one for me when I trust and allow.
This was an incredible post. The perfect thing I needed to read at the perfect time. I am really enjoying what you have to say. There is so much that resonates with me. In this post, trying to hard instead of allowing things to evolve more naturally is genius. I can definitely use this advice. Thanks for this great article.
Glad it was helpful, and hope you’re able to put the info to good use.
Laura, I came across your blog this morning and I just wanted to say how absolutely wonderful it is. I relate so much with what you write about. I too am in counseling, but I just began the second half of my practicum yesterday so I’m not quite as accomplished as you are. As a means to deal with my “unfinished business” and become more authentic, I started my blog. Finding your blog was just what I needed today. As a perfectionist, I’m constantly TRYING to make everything better, but this morning in therapy, I decided to let some stuff go….within an hour of leaving, I found your blog. I found myself somewhat emotional reading throughout your posts needless to say. I really believe the Universe has a way in our lives. I hope I can manifest much of what you have going forward with my career and life: )
Also, I reblogged your first post as well. I hope you don’t mind. You can see it here:
Thank you for your inspirational stories!
~Nina
Hi Nina,
Thank you so much for sharing my post on your blog. It really does sound like you meant to find my blog today! You are amazing to be in the place where you are at your age! I look forward to reading more about your journey as well!
xoxo
Laura
Yes! In fact, I’m kind of obsessed with her work right now. I do have the book, I’ve seen all of her videos and I actually signed up for her “wholehearted reflection” e-course/inspirational reflections this week!! .
I actually wrote a post about her work about a month ago too!
I guess great minds do think alike; ) Thanks for thinking of me!
I also bought her 12-week program that she developed with Hazelden to do with therapy groups. I’ll check out the “reflections,” too.
Hi again, Nina. I was thinking about your perfectionism, and wondered if you’re familiar with Brene’ Brown’s work? She has two books out, and two TED talks, as well as a PBS special. You might be interested in her book “The Gifts of Imperfection.” I’ve used it myself and with clients for that past year or so. I love it and so do my clients.
Uh! Posting from my phone and clearly I replie to the wrote post: )
No worries, I still saw it! 🙂
I think I try to hard, worry too much and now I am doing LOA to try to help me. Thanks for sharing your blog and messages.
Glad it resonated for you, Jackie!Sorry, Maureen. You can never get Matthew back.
Looks like no one was at the Wilcher-Hughes wedding. Just the bride, groom, and Margaret.
Also, congreats to Matt on his new job! No more night working!

This post is dedicated to Kailyn and Matt's marriage certificate
I just got my BBW order and Leaves smells like applesauce or something. Not sure if I likes it :(
oh hey the blog is back for canadians, suck it casey :)
It really was casey raging about little bladders name.
He pronounces her name just like the rere here was raging insisting it was. Also...No casey I have never "Eden" an elephant ear. wtf
he spelled her name "LittleBallaDeer" in the desc box
late on this. I actually bought the chocolate bacon cupcake candle. I think that whore is nuts for hoarding them like she does.
Its pretty good, but I feel like she just goes over the top to shove it in peoples faces.
It smells like a super chocolate-y sea salt caramel cupcake. Its a fucking candle.
Does anyone have an ipsy sub?
i feel like the space under where it says the court clerk's name is where the witnesses should be? but since they didn't have any it's blank? does maryland not require a marriage to be witnessed? or maybe because a court lady did it, so it's already official?
Venter: im upset.
Venter: confused.
Venter: its going to sound
Venter: very stupid
Me: Try me.
Venter: ok
Venter: 2 days ago i dumped my ex for cheating on me.
Venter: he was an ass and not so good in bed.
Venter: but that night my twin brother. when he came home. and held me in my sleep, kissed the back of my head, told me everything will be ok.
Venter: i realy liked it. but hes my fucking twin brother.
wat
lulz maryland DOESN'T require witnesses. how convenient for the friendless couple!
Witnesses And Officiants
A religious official, judge, clerk of the circuit court or an appointed, designated deputy clerk of the circuit court can officiate weddings in Maryland. Witnesses are not required.
if anyone else was at that wedding there would be pictures. we saw the EMPTY courtroom.
LOL I feel like I'm on GG.
lol kai is going to rage, and so will matt.
omg what friendless losers
BIG BIRD!!!
WHAT was the point of her nose job?
I understand subtle but my god there's literally nothing nice about that nose either
oh hey the blog is back for canadians, suck it casey :)
^^^ wow you are a fucking rere we discussed this last week dummy. casey got it back and the blog is being monitored by google and the police ok...
omg what friendless losers
ikr. this blog is filled with reres.
lmao oh did we? i just refresh the comments page so i never noticed. relax, canadians are supposed to be happy :)
I'm bored...anyone want to piss off GG fatties with me?
lmao oh did we? i just refresh the comments page so i never noticed. relax, canadians are supposed to be happy :)
fuck you cunt. :)
Good things come to those who wait!
And divorthes come to those who don't.
bitch is on crack!
Do any of you buy indie nail polishes? what are some good ones?
lol you would never think her sister is dulcecandy, one of the most popular gurus.
i bet kai doesn't even have a copy of her own marriage certificate
lol ikr
kai's probably screenshotting the blog, printing it, and framing it. we'll see it in the background of her next video
Casey Knudsen, listen here. That marriage certificate is public record. A pretty lady simply sent a request in and they mailed it to her. You know that AIDSy faggot is going to try and report this post.
I like the indie polishes that are actually colors not just glitter in clear ya know?
Kailyn Marie @ForeverKailynx Avon has alot of cool stuff coming out for the holidays!
Kai's nails make me want to vomit! When she's showing all the recent stuff she hoarded, her nails are disgusting. Kai, be real, how the fuck do you pick at anything with those nubs?!! You obviously eat/bite your nails! Don't fucking lie bitch!
Gossip sites post marriage certificates and divorce papers all the time. Public record, Casey. Sahrry!
yeah, i don't understand how she can "pick" her nails until they're that short. bitch IS eating them as an in-between snacks snack. end of.
does anyone else see peter pettigrew when they see LovelyLavenderwhip?
Lulz YES
Yep, people who bite their nails have tiny little stubs left.
I can't believe somebody would have a kid at 17,18,19 and 21. Why the fuck would you do that? I really doubt that they're all to her husband. I remember thinking that he looked like a fat spic, I don't think the kids look like him at all.
my bf is the one of the far right. do you ladies think he is hot? god i want him rn. all my friends are so jealous
lol that's about trish aka twishycarestar being a teen mom
ooh I'd lick the fungus growing between his rolls, he kinda looks like davit..
you better hang on to that ball of sex
ugh I just peed blood
Disgusting pigs. Mods should have just let this stupid blog die.
tiffany leno, the 30 year old housewife, is doing videos on PLL
tiff is worse than kai. they have no friends to discuss their tv shows with so they make videos and ask their subs about it.
I think I have a kidney infection, dis is hell on urf
new kai video! bbwhale is as bloated and greasy as ever
Disgusting pigs. Mods should have just let this stupid blog die.
go away afshawn
whats up with her shirt
LOL
kai has been doing makeup tutorials for years and STILL sucks at applying and blending the crease color. she got that blue all over the lid and didn't even fix it (well im not done watching it but 100 bucks says she doesnt fix it) sf annoying. kinda like when a teacher forgets to erase that one black speck on the board. FIX THAT SHIT!
i think kai did a plus sized haul and bought herself some new shirts. of course she's not announcing it though.
thats fucking scary 813
kai is speaking so weirdly in this video
lmao kai admitted she put her lashes on backwards in her last video. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. she can not fucking put lashes on properly EVER. it's always backwards and the wrong eye. we saw when she showed her pack of lashes, all the right-side ones used up.
DEMON KAKA posted a new video*. Kai is nowhere in that video
shes high as fuck
and of course casey is one of the first to comment on kai's video. the faggot is amongst us.
~Partyin' wit Purpleth~, uses blue eyeshadow.
I just blue myself
kais voice is deeper in this video... SHES A WOMAN NOW!
she is women dummy
shes just a girl....
"ith a very bad beeeuty habit dat i do...... but i know alota other people that do it. da exact same way."
THAT DOESN'T MAKE IT OK? Lulz she's such a fasy retard. And she doesn't want her eyeliner to look "wonky" (hmm), too bad!
crack is a really bad habit but i know a lot of other people do it so it's okay. =]
i'm talking to this guy from ireland that's apparently drunk and says that he has to drink constantly before he sees his girlfriend. isn't glorias closet boyfriend from ireland? lulz
ahh the power of angles and lighting. guess who this is?
is that diarrheaandheaves?
That leighanne bitch who's friends with bunny?
kai!! this bitch stole your halloween costume!
That leighanne bitch who's friends with bunny?
yup!
the video if anyone is interested:
what's been up with kai's eyebrow?
she has a scar
kai is depressed. poor bbgurl. ~story of muh lyfe~
I think Gloria's bf is scottish. Maybe he's gay, maybe he's a chubby chaser. I choose to believe that he plans to murder her and feast on her nutritious, piquant blubber.
* superfluous blubber
I hate that her eyeshadow never has shape. It's just blobs of color on her eyelid.
dtw all the sexy guys are either married or too young for you :(
I CANT STAHP EATIN TAKIS ;(
i read that too quickly as "i can't stahp eating pakis" lulz. what are takis?
I really should have gone with piquante over piquant
kai's eye looks sf beady before she puts on her "partying with purples" e/s on (still dying at the title- she can only have parties with her makeup)! bbgurl, you do NOT have ~big, buh-rown eyes. stop trying to force them to look huge in pitchurs.
Um it's like hot chili pepper and lime rolled up corn chip things. I would never eat a paki
i read that too quickly as "i can't stahp eating pakis" lulz. what are takis?
same. i thought oh shit afshawn finally outed herself
Gloria's gay bf is not hot. He's muscular but also creepy and ginger.
i love gingers. the redder the better
but compared to her he is a male model
I wonder if afshawn will buy a fake baby doll and pose with it like that crazy nignog
ja he's the best gloria can get but not that out of the ordinary for regular, pretty, non whale types
i think that's what it is tbh. he's not hot but he looks better when he's next to gloria.
I bought some wet look laygins today and now i dont know what i was thinking. I have no idea how to style them
those mormons have some sick moves
I wonder how long Lindsay Lohan has left to live. I give her 1 year. I call it.
Lilo legit looks about 60 years old. Haggard af and so sad to watch her older movies before she went batshit.
lbr even her friends and family are probably wondering how she pulled a half decent looking dude.
I was looking at her instagram the other day and there are some hilarious unintentionally offensive comments from her stans. Like OMG! I wish i could find a guy that wasnt shallow and didnt care about looks at all!
i cackled
lulz Jessica simpson's dad is gay, I can see that
christ she can't even blend her eyeshadow..it looks like a muddy mess. u would think after all these years of her doing tutorials that she would actually be decent at them.
what's her instagram?
Looking quite bloated. I bet her next move is getting knocked up asap to be like lorraine
damn she is bloated
Isn't he a virgin though? I wonder if he pounds her rolls to save himself?
I kinda feel bad for her, everyone either thinks he's in the closet or a chubby chaser. If he's a chubby chaser she'll stay the same weight or gain, just like our bbgurl
ewwwwwwwww michele looks grey
shes supposedly on a weight loss journey, but hasnt it been literally over a year and shes only 35 pounds down? a girl her size could literally do that in a month or two.
She is fugly, her hubby must have to do her from behind to get off.
of course gloria has to settle for a long distance relationship where they see each other once every 100 days. they're legit counting down on their instagram and there is literally a pick on the ginger's saying 92 DAYS UNTIL I GET TO HOLD HER!
GG is raging that they noticed there were only two eggs in the carton, so jen asking for another egg only left sweet cinderdonald with 1 egg! such a greedy heifer! and in utah there were only 4 slices of tomato, but jen wanted more so it left sweet donald with much less!!!!!
like who the fuck even notices this shit? and i'm sure there were more eggs and tomatoes ffs, they aren't poor.
I'm guessing her 'journey' is on the back burner since things got serious with the ginger. If anything, you'd think he'd encourage her to work out and eat healthily. I'm leaning towards him just being a chubby chaser with feminine tendencies. I remember reading a lot of them have a thing for giant, flabby boobs and they view an obese body as just a huge boob lol
i can't believe GG is still raging over the eggs. like why is that a huge topic of discussion over there?
yeah, the ginger is into fitness, but then gets an obese slob. oh ok.
Lol GG is also obsessed if Jen will do the fall tag or not.
am I a rere for thinking gossmakeup shouldn't be using models and celebs as his thumbnails? I thought that wasn't allowed
i could see davit doing this
JullianAllen 1 hour ago
hey wayne, i'm 16 years old, but i look like i'm 14. i want to look more my age and the only way ive been able to achieve that is to wear a LOT of makeup. its like a genetic thing to look young in my family. i.e. my sisters 27 but she looks like shes 18. i was wondering if you have techniques of looking a bit older without using too much makeup. i know that ill be thankful when im older, but when im outside i dont want to look like im a little girl.
lulz, kids are so fucking stoopid nowadays. I'm 16 but look 14, oh noes!
it isn't allowed. it's misleading. but YT doesn't really care when it's someone who gets a ton of views.
lol 16 but she looks 2 years younger. that would be an ok question if it were a 30 year old who looked 12.
i'm surprised GG hasn't mentioned kai's marriage certificate. then again i'm not, because they'd never admit they were on nasty MF. you know those bitches are all lurking though and saw it.
Kids are more stupid now, just look at Amanda Todd. I think a big part of it has to do with their parents, who grew up in the 80s/early 90s and are raising their kids to be more selfish and self obsessed as themselves. Everyjuan under 15 is a special, yooneek snowflake.
where is maureen? i miss the days when she'd be raging over something like the certificate, and would tweet all night about it and argue with people.
*than themselves
That's like Chelsea bragging about how she's 20 but people think she's 18. Bitch - you look ratchet!
yeah, where the fuck is momo? Hospital, trapped under Keef, murdered by nate? I miss her nonetheless.
isn't her dad's trial suppose to be around now?
lbr, the 16 y.o probably wants to look older so she can suck off some 22 y.o she has a crush on.
lol exactly. the little whore just wants to pass as college aged.
Take this post down! How dare you get private personal information and the post it here! Kailyn's marriage license is none of your business! I can't believe you people went and got it. Rediculous.
Intention Blogger! Remove this post now. This is defemination!
Madd's deodorant or axe body spray isn't on Kai's dresser anymore, TROUBLE IN PARADISE HMMMMM?
Holy shit late to the fun party but lmfao at "NONE" and holy shit madd is older than i thought.. (or maybe i dont pay enought attention to that lesbian) how is he that much of a fucking loser that he can't even support himself jfc no wonder these asshats got married
pretty ladies so called it that about leeshas mom being an alchy. check out her instagram they are literally filling a board with all of her old wine corks.
if your knees look like this i dont wanna see them
wow whose knees are those?
knee lady
why are bunny's hands sf haggard? they look like they belong to an 80 year old woman
im practicing my eye roll for the day i see or hear about bunny and her swamptards on tv or in a magazine. you know its coming. did you see how big her disney world meet up was
i'm so making that this weekend. carbs. yummmmmm :)
I just watched Chelsea's ghost costume tutorial and that bitch tries way too hard to be funny. I get secondhand embarrassment from watching her.
what color should i paint my nails?
i need to paint my nails too. i think i want to do deep red.
i have ~50 nail polishes and i hate every single one of them :(
i have ~50 nail polishes and i hate every single one of them :(
i know that feeling. i went to pick out a polish the other night and hated every single one i had. i don't even know why either.
I just painted mine with OPI's Lincoln Park After Dark. I lahv it.
i'm in this weird mood where i suddenly lahv colors that i used to hate. i never wore greens and now i'm wanting an army green polish. i think i'm just bored with what i usually go for tbh.
opi - uh oh, roll down the window
or
essie - sew psyched?
I just did my nails! I bought a couple Essence nail polishes and they are cheap and pretty good! I used the color chic reloaded and I lahve it.
im trying not to buy any more polish
i think im gonna do
wet n wild megelast in deadly dose
and with sally hansen hard as nails xtreme wear in strobe light
what do yall think?
of course tiff has WAYYLON locked in the room with her.
I know 10:42, I'm thinking Nylon probably has something in the works w/ her, otherwise why would they print some random e-mail asking them to feature Grav3yardGirl.
Nail ladies, do you remove your own cuticles, and is it hard to do?
I missed it, what's Matt's new job?
NEVER remove the eponychium (live cuticle), it can permanently your nailbeds. To remove the true cuticle which is just dead skin stuck to the edges of your nails use cuticle remover like Blue Cross or Sally Hansen and gently scrape it off with either another nail or a orange stick.
we don't know, kai just tweeted that matt started a new job today and no more night working for him.
I think he got a job on Wall Street....I think he's a trader or something.
why would matt ignore kai for a month and then randomly tell her he got a new job? she's lying.
he volunteers at the AIDS ward in the hospital. he was inspired by kai's new HIV+ friend, casey knudsen.
Skincare goddess, what do you think of paula's choice products? Please answer back
He's going to make Don-style money so Kai can live her housewife dream life.
yeah i think kai is lying about all of this. seeing matt, being down his house, his new job. he probably hasn't even talked to her in a month.
does anyone pick at their cuticles? any way to fix it? my middle finger cuticle is a ratchet destroyed mess =[
Okay, I'm seriously contemplating making those Peanut Butter Pumpkins Brooke's mom made. I'll have my beyonce take them to work so I don't make a Kai of myself.
Tick tock, the time to get that annulment is running out. Not that their divorce would be difficult, they have no assets to speak of whatsoever.
those pumpkin cookies are super cute, but it looks like a lot of work tbh.
thank you so much pretty lady who posted the rawbrahs. they get a lot of shit because they started out raw but found that it was for them after a year, but you live and learn. they still eat quality raw fruit but they also eat a variety. i think they are inspiring and I love how enthusiastic and unafraid of life they are. ive already dug my juicer out of the back of my cabinet and started juicing again because of them.
i made these last week because i was pms-ing and omg soooo good.
a pretty lady actually posted this recipe probably 6 months ago and i bookmarked it.
omg !! I wanna make some now.
Do you think kai bitch faces when she sees all these yum yum recipes and wishes she could cook ? I personally think bb is perfectly happy with her little debbie snacks.
I JUST watched Brooke's vid and noted it was being talked about. Brooke's mom's kitchen makes me soooo sad! Everything is soo old including all her measuring cups, bowls, utensils. She probably has not gotten new stuff since she got married or something.
they're measuring cups and bowls... it's not like you can really get any more modern with those.
I suck at cooking but I'm better at baking/desserts. I also can't deal with certain textures like raw meat and when I'm cooking for other people I get so nervous that I'm going to give them my germs and they'll get sick and then I end up washing my hands like a billion times. OCD thucks =[
"they're measuring cups and bowls... it's not like you can really get any more modern with those."
ok brooke
lulz, knew that was coming. their entire house is old and dated like the wilchers but that was such a gg typa thing to pick at. EW, YOUR MEASURING CUPS ARE OLD! like wut? it was a clear mixing bowl, silver spoon and a basic ass measuring cup. what are they supposed to look like?
I'm currently watching X files. Please don't judge.
I hope I can still sit with you guys :)
WTF is up with the super wierd giggle exhale at 3:21?? It is loud and weird sounding as shit. I am seriously scared. What is WRONG with Kai?? There HAS to be something wrong.
Have you watched any of her other baking vids? She's got some old ass egg beaters, crystal candy-type of bowls that she mixes her shit in with the old beaters. All of her shit is old and it's pretty obvious.
lol kais aspie ass freaking out over the palette lid snapping.
nope, i don't pay attention to brooke tbh. i was expecting like wood spoons and shit though.
brooke is missing the point. she said EVERYTHING was old, not just measuring cups. buy your mom some new kitchen utensils ffs.
Ikr? The giggle/exhale is louder than the talking, so it catches you off guard. It's sf scary.
i died at kai scaring herself by snapping the palette shut. she jumped and almost had a heart attack. she's sf jumpy. no wonder she freaks out when she's home alone and runs to check the door every time there's a noise. does she live in fear that maureen or some crazed hater is going to get her?
i no ur not sposed to pull on your eyelids but i wouldn't be able to 'ply eyeliner at all if i didn't
... you still can't. it's lumpy and the wing is wonky as fuck and rounded. work on your fucking technique, future makeup artist~
'' Brookes measuring cups look poor ''
Srsly bitch? Get back to GG and bitch about how many eggs are in the carton at Jen's house.
X-Files lady, I've been some version of a redhead since the late 90s, mostly because of Gillian Anderson.
brooke's mad
how does she keep putting her lashes on backwards? it's obvious just by looking at them. the long end is always on the outter corner just like your normal fucking lashes ffs.
I just watched that hkitty vid linked earlier and one of the comments tells her she looks like a plus sized 'brandi' aka juicystar07. LOL! Brandi!!!
what is this link?
it takes me to this:
who is raging about ladies calling her cooking stuff old? IT IS. it's tacky. Most people keep a few things that have meaning or stood the test of time but update things.
it's monotone brooke. how dare you say her monotone mama has POOR things!
romney/ryan 2012 #1 fan
LMAO HER SAGGY UTTERS! that's basically what obese taylor has, but taylor's are more saggy and the nips point ALL the way down.
I have a hearty laugh every time I open a brooke video and catch a glimpse of her ancient tv perched atop the old ass discolored table. Also her giant white rain crusted hair, but that goes without saying.
ikr, of course brooke is raging her mom's kitchen stuff is fine, she herself is stuck in 1991.
ummmmmmmmmmm is that pic real?? my mom's 55 and she has same typa tits/nipples/areolas. dafaq
lmao gurl why you got your moms tits memorized?
totes catholic, y'all! as catholic as kai =]
i seen her nekkid recently
her tits are gross jfc.
is it weird that im kinda turned on? i dont like fat tays tits tho
You guys are totally right. I toss out all of my perfectly fine, no chips or holes in them kitchen are on a yearly basis. Gotta keep up with those new kitchen ~fashions~
Kitchen ware*
brooke stfu already you poor stupid bitch. that shit is like 30 years old.
- "I'm a conservative republican who is all about the catholic faith, masturbation is evil" poses topless/sexy costumes for fetish sites on the internet
- "i'm intelligent" drops out of college and her genetics major to be an actress in la.

The top talent in the USHL is 18 and 19 years old. The NTDP will be playing entirely with 16 and 17-year-olds. The NTDP hasn't dominated the NAHL; they certainly won't dominate the USHL. On the other hand, this will certainly improve the "recruiting" of the NTDP.

And poster on USCHO (Hammer). The comments in the interview are just about spot on. While Ferris hasn't really been a thump-and-bang thug team in about 3-4 years, they are still very undisciplined and quite frankly have squandered this season. All their prominent scoring has returned, and they may not hit 100 goals this season.
If it's low scoring, I like FSU's chances to get one. If the scoreboard shows a 4-3 or 5-4 game, or even higher, Michigan's chances look really, really good.
Nice 6-1 win for Michigan. The only FSU goal, was because Hogan was out of position. Mitera looked good, but out of place at times. Great win, nice fans. Except for this one FSU fan that kept pretending that UofM was Minnesota and then pretending that he had never heard of Michigan. Very ironic coming from a Ferris State Fan.

Comments on “Helping The others Realize The Advantages Of operating system homework help”August is University Open Day month in Victoria, so for those of us with teenagers trying to decide on courses and subjects Sundays are spent visiting universities. Sunday just gone was Monash University Open Day. The Big Girl is thinking of architecture as a career so Hubby took her and The Little Girl across to the Caulfield Campus in the morning then after lunch The Boy and I met them at the Clayton campus ... Hubby and my old stomping grounds.
Although there were some changes, much of the university was familiar and we soon found ourselves confidently making our way around the massive site. It was a little surreal sitting in E1 where we both had engineering lectures all those years ago. It's still pretty much the same except for a new coat of white paint on the walls and double screens for the powerpoint presentations. Gone are the double chalkboards that some lecturers would fill every last space up over the course of the hour and the overhead projector with transparencies. One other thing had changed ... Hubby did not take up his standard lecture position of head on the desk asleep!
The Hargrave Cafe is still there, although the long lines of white laminate table and chairs have been replaced with cafe style furniture ... and there's a sign on the front.
There were a few major changes, the multi-storey carpark outside the engineering department threw me a little when I drove in the back way and this massive building is the new chemistry building.
It opened this year with new undergraduate chemistry labs.
This is where I did my first year undergraduate as well as a year of teaching ...
That completes #10 (a college or university) of this year's photohunt.

The Benefits of Using an Eco Friendly Reusable Canvas Tote Bag - and the Negative Effects of Plastic Bags
When you head to the grocery store, there's a multitude of reusable bags available for sale. However, how durable are they? If you can't wash your bag in the washing machine, does it make sense as a purchase for you, especially when you're carrying raw meat and produce? Reusable canvas tote bags are an excellent choice for your grocery shopping trips, for their durability, their look, and for the fact that they can be washed after many uses.
Using any type of reusable bag is a giant step you can take towards helping the environment. The negative effects of plastic bags are everywhere, from the toll on wildlife, the pollution in our rivers, and the overfilling of our landfills. While plastic isn't going anywhere any time soon, we can all make small changes to reduce our plastic use today, and eventually phase out plastic entirely someday.
What Happens to Your Plastic Bags?
What do you do with your plastic bags if you happen to get them at the grocery store or elsewhere?
Why Bother Using Reusable Canvas Tote Bags?
Why should you bother using reusable bags? After all, disposable bags are convenient, and always there when you need them. It would be nice to forget about the impact of our disposable lifestyle, and think that throwing things away doesn't affect us, or never will. The fact of the matter is that throwing away plastic does have repercussions. These consequences are evident in the Pacific Garbage Patch, a floating pile of man-made plastic debris in the Pacific Ocean. Amazingly, this piece of giant plastic is growing in size, and floats on top of the water like a man-made island. Wildlife can get caught in the debris, tangled, and ingest the debris, ultimately dying. This in turn can wind up in our fish, which we then consume.
Another downside to plastic is that it never biodegrades, even in water. Plastic bags in particular break apart into smaller pieces, polluting the ground soil, and eventually our drinking supply.
Ten Reasons to Use Reusable Bags
Why should you use reusable bags? To some, they seem inconvenient. You can't beat the convenience of something disposable sometimes, and it's easy to overlook the consequences of things that are easy. Here are a few reasons why you should reconsider using reusable bags instead of the throw-away plastic kinds that you're using now:
1. Plastic bags wind up on the roads, in parking lots, caught in trees, on car antennas, everywhere, making a giant eye sore for everyone to look at. In other words, plastic bags look like garbage, because they are.
2. They kill wildlife. Wildlife easily become suffocated and strangled by the plastic material. Unlike us, they can't pull the bag from off their heads. Once it's on, it's on. There's no natural defense mechanism for birds and wildlife to remove plastic bags.
3. Reusable bags save you money. Not big money, but a little bit of money. For every bag you bring into your grocery store, they'll credit you 5 cents (at most grocery stores). It's like having one extra coupon at the checkout.
4. You can fit more stuff into a reusable bag. Most reusable bags can fit 2-3 times as much as the normal plastic bag. That means less back and forth trips from the car to the house, from the house to the car, and back again.
5. They don't rip like plastic bags. Ever had a container of milk explode because a plastic bag ripped apart during transport? Not a pretty sight to see, or smell for that matter.
6. Reusable bags are washable. Not all reusable bags, but some can be washed, especially if they are constructed of canvas.
7. Plastic bags increase our dependence on foreign oil. Plastic bags use oil, which we purchase from foreign countries that frankly don't like the United States. When we buy their oil, we support them, and indirectly support terrorism against us.
8. Plastic bags have high emissions during production. When plastic bags are produced, the process has a high amount of emissions into the air.
9. Plastic bags are not biodegradable. Reusable canvas bags, however, are made of natural materials that in time, will break down.
10. Plastic bags cause sea creatures to suffocate. When plastic bags are floating in the ocean, animals like turtles easily mistake these for jellyfish or something to be consumed. When the plastic bags pass through their system, they knot up, blow up, or cannot be passed by the animal and lead to death.
How Does Your Reusable Bag Hold Up Over Time?
Do you use reusable bags for your grocery shopping?
How Plastic Bags Effect Birds
One of the deadliest consequences of plastic bags has been the suffocation of birds. In flight, birds can often get caught in plastic bags, suffocating and trying to escape until exhaustion. Without hands, it's pretty difficult to remove something that's trapped over your entire body.
How do plastic bags end up in the environment? From garbage trucks, and from the number one cause, littering. Littering of plastic bags and other man-made materials have deadly consequences, as you can read on this article about birds and plastics. Even small bits of plastic bags that have torn apart can still choke birds to death, and has a similar effect on ocean critters.
What You Can Do to Prevent Plastic Bags From Entering the Environment
If you throw away your plastic bags, try to send them to be recycled instead. Most grocery stores have a receptacle to recycle plastic bags. If you know someone that doesn't use reusable bags, give them a couple of yours. If it's up for discussion, tell them about the consequences of plastic bags, and how switching to reusable bags is a good alternative. If that's not enough, throw in the tidbit about the reusable bag credit - that's usually a good last resort.

Make Plastic Extinct! Go Reusable with Your Shopping Bags!
Every year, trillions - not millions or even billions - of plastic bags are thrown away, tossed forever into a landfill. Plastic bags take thousands of years to break apart, and when we say break apart, we don't mean decompose. Organic matter decomposes. Plastic matter, like plastic bags and bottles, do not decompose. They break down into smaller bits and pieces, polluting rivers, waterways, streams, and oceans. This contaminates our drinking supply, and negatively effects our wildlife.
But, there's hope! We can reduce our plastic bag use through reusable bags. Let's make plastic extinct. It's time plastic bags went the way of the dinosaur - go reusable!

Expert Answers
The opening of Whitman’s lifework, “Leaves of Grass,” this poem has enjoyed popularity since the mid-nineteenth century, and holds a place in American literature equal to Moby Dick and Tom Sawyer. The honesty, the frankness, the transcendental beauty of this self-portrait, a blank-verse revelation of a man’s (of all men’s) connection with the universe, has a poetic structure entirely internal and natural, words so telling in their imagery that they are quoted by everyone in every walk of life. There is no parallel in modern poetry for its honesty and truthfulness. When a poet combines his own personal biography with such a universal understanding of his place in all existence, he will always find a permanent place in our collective psyche.

“History makes us. If you have no awareness of what happened before you came into the world – your biological history, your species history, your family’s history, the history of your community, the geography you inhabit, the political and theological and philosophic history around you – how do you claim to know anything about yourself or others at all?” – Charles Darwin
“There’s no ‘self’ worth anything without an understanding of personal, social, and natural world history. The meaningful experience of ‘self’ does not happen in some magical bubble or vacuum. The conscious understanding of ‘self’ begins when you learn how to read the stories that came before you and created your life, your feelings, your understanding of being and knowing.” – Dali Lama

One of the most common accidents that occur in the home is a slip and fall type accident. A study by a leading Massachusetts Law Group found that there are over 8 million of these types of accidents in North America every year. Also, over half a million of these result in some sort of hospitalization and it is the main cause of reported accidents in places such as hotels, restaurants, and public building. Anti slip paint can go a long way toward making walking surfaces safer for all people but especially the elderly who are the most likely to suffer these types of debilitating accidents.
Anti Slip Paint
Concrete Anti Slip Floor Paint
Anti Slip Spray Paint
One of the most common areas for slips and falls in the home is the bathroom. Especially the tub and shower area. You can make your tub or enclosure much safer by using a spray on anti slip paint product. It is very easy to use and really not very expensive at all. Be sure to continually shake the can while you are using it in order to keep the additive mixed up in the paint. Also, it is a good idea to practice spraying on a surface you don’t care about before you try it on your tub or tiles. It is not difficult but you don’t want the paint to run or puddle because that really doesn’t look very good at all.
As with any paint the surface prep is very important. You problem here will be soap that may still be coating the area. Use a good household cleaner to be sure you have removed all the soap residue in order to help the paint to stick.
If I was going to do one project to make a house safer for my mother or father it would be to apply anti slip painting to the tub and shower area. Just think about it, if they fall hear the chances of hitting their head and causing a lot of physical harm is very real. Isn’t an afternoon project worth your family’s well being?

Posted on Aug 31, 2011
A car filled with North Carolina teenagers crashed and flipped early on Saturday morning after what appeared to be a night of underaged drinking and partying. The community is struggling with the loss of two young women, while police are investigating where the teens acquired alcohol and whether or not the driver of the car, 17-year-old Bryanna Hamilton of Fayetteville, was drunk.
Killed in the crash were 18-year-old Cheyenna Cummings of Hope Mills and 16-year-old Denzel Graves of Spring Lake. A number of other teens in the car, 19-year-old Alya Shaw of Fayetteville, 17-year-old Benyetta Nicholas 14-year-old Isaiah Nicholas of Spring Lake and 18-year-old Chyna Harris of Spring Lake, suffered a range of injuries. Both Cummings and graves were ejected from the vehicle during the rollover. Graves died at the scene of the accident, while Cummings suffered a severe head injury and was taken off life support in the days after the crash.
Police say that Hamilton admitted to drinking that night, had bloodshot eyes, and smelled of alcohol. She did not have a driver’s license. The group of teens had been to a variety of places and parties that night, though it is not clear if any adults knew that the minors were drinking or where the teens got their alcohol.

Natchez Trace Parkway
Cypress Swamp along the Natchez Trace Parkway
On the first leg of our RV journey, we travelled north from Austin to Dallas, TX for my brother Adam’s wedding. Then we went east to the small town of Natchez, MS. We spent the next two weeks traveling all 444 miles of the Natchez Trace Parkway. What an amazing experience!
Beautiful Chattanooga
Pardon me, boys – is this the Chattanooga Choo Choo?
Arriving at the northern end of the Parkway in Nashville, TN, we made our way to Chattanooga and enjoyed a wonderful week there. Neither of us had ever visited, and we loved the river running through town, the many activities (Ruby Falls, Incline Railway, Aquarium, Rock City) and the Arts District.
The next month from April-May 2014, we made our way back to Texas before a whirlwind two weeks in Austin and my youngest brother’s college graduation.
Summer Along the Gulf Coast
The world’s largest amateur sandcastle contest in Galveston, TX
The second leg of our journey took us along the Gulf of Mexico. We celebrated the beginning of summer in Galveston before stops in New Orleans and Pensacola. We spent about a month in Florida and had a surprising breakdown.
Fun Times on the East Coast
Boone Hall Plantation outside Charleston, SC
We made so many memories going up and down the east coast from July-November 2014. Hilton Head, Charleston, Virginia Beach, Williamsburg and back down through Raleigh, Myrtle Beach and Jacksonville…I smile as the memories flood back from our the wonderful things we’ve seen, local cuisine we’ve tasted, walks we’ve taken holding hands (okay, getting sappy…).
Old Highway 19
This beautiful site all to ourselves in Sopchoppy, FL for only $15/night
We were going to take the most straightforward route from Orlando back to Austin, but a client recommended we try Florida’s Old Highway 19 instead. We’re so glad we did! We had a county park to ourselves for a week in Sopchoppy, right on the banks of a quiet river. We had brunch at an historic hotel in Cross City. And we took a day trip to Apalachicola for some unforgettable seafood and fun street strolling (and oh, the sunset we saw on our drive!).
We’re Grateful
We had an amazing 2014. Our 2015 plans will take us west, where we know we’ll find a whole new set of adventures! Thanks for traveling with us.
-BThe Military and Veteran Resources Program at Oregon State University is a proud recipient of the Oregon Department of Veterans’ Affairs Campus Veteran Resource Grant. Oregon State University, along with 13 other universities and community colleges, share in a portion of the $1 million dollar award to help enhance veteran services at public institutions throughout the State of Oregon.
The grant was made possible with the passage of Senate Bill 143 in the 2017 Oregon Legislature. The Bill is intended to augment existing campus programs that help veterans successfully transition from military service to college life, succeed in college and complete educational goals, and transition from college to the workforce in the community.
The intended use for the funds at Oregon State include the upgrading of the computer workstations that are available for the Military and Veteran Community members while on campus, enhancing the campus orientation program for incoming student veterans, and creating a designated representative focused on the needs of our Ecampus military connected students.

“Hi Dan,
I have really enjoyed the course. I am new to the web development and AngularJS world. You are an excellent instructor. You made the subject materials very understandable and intriguing along the way.
A couple of months ago I went to the ASP.NET MVC class where the instructor touched the AngularJS for an hour towards the end of the training. Basically, no time to spend about the materials at all.
After that, I was very intrigued with the features, then I have started digging about the framework and love it very much.
I hope you will have another course here at Udemy.com where you can build the SPA application with real world example. You can think of using Northwind/Adventures database where you can apply all the techniques you have thought to build the application from the ground-up.
Thanks again.” (Bidhan Chakma)

I love France so the thought of an overnight stay near Le Mans was very appealing to me and I nodded to Hub’s suggestion of finding the Green 7 hotel.
This comfortable hotel lies on the southern edge of Le Mans on the 138 ‘Tours’ road and not very far from the famous Le Mans racetrack. It sits at the entrance to a large wooded area. We had stayed here before and found the management very friendly and welcoming.
Soon we were parking in the forecourt of the hotel and then went to book a room for the night. After leaving our overnight bags in our room, we went seeking something to eat. We stretched our legs and went for quite a long walk and soon came across a McDonalds- type restaurant and take away. There we bought burgers, fries and drinks and took them back to our hotel room. After our little feast, I indulged in a hot bath and then we settled into the comfy beds and watched French TV. I seem to recall we watched an old black and white French film and really enjoyed it; I’ve always liked French films, finding them very atmospheric.
Hub & Raymond
Bed & Breakfast
Cimetiere Chinoise
It was our last full day and after having a drive down to the bay at Cap Hornu (this really is a delightful spot), we met up again with Raymond and he took us to lunch at a restaurant on the outskirts of the town, called Le Moulin (the windmill). I say lunch but it ended up a 4 course meal and with a wonderful red wine to accompany it!
For starters we had little pieces of toast with all kinds of pate. Hub and I had steak in red wine for main course and Raymond had Ostrich. It was beautifully cooked but then I have never, in all my times of visiting France, experienced a bad meal. Then some glass bowls appeared in front of us, filled with sorbet; Raymond said it was apple sorbet with Calvados, the apple brandy. He warned us not to drink too much of the liquid as we could end up drunk! He also told us it was to ‘clean’ the palette, ready for dessert, which as I recall was mixed ice creams.
Where we sat overlooked the marshlands at the back of Le Moulin and we saw sheep grazing there; Raymond said that was where the lamb came from of our previous dinner and that it had the unique flavour because the animals grazed on the salt marshes.
After our sumptuous meal we drove back into St Valery and Raymond took us to the graveyard where his wife was buried. It was a very handsome headstone made of black marble and I laid a few flowers there, feeling quite tearful that I had never met this lady who Raymond had loved so much. In a corner of the graveyard was a spot where some British soldiers lay buried; soldiers who had died in battle during world war two.
That was our last meal with Raymond, as we were leaving the following day at midday. So we said our goodbyes to him but I felt rather sad at leaving him. He had obviously enjoyed our company and he looked a lonely figure as we took our leave; he lived alone and now had no loving wife to return to.
The following day we were all ready to leave the Bed & Breakfast. I presented the owners Jacques and Marie Christine with a potted plant saying how much we had enjoyed our stay and that we would come back some day. They were a very nice couple and along with their two teenage sons had made us very welcome, even making us a pot of tea each morning for breakfast.
We drove away from the B&B and went to take one last look at the riverside in St Valery. But as we left the parking area by the river and before we reached the level crossing, the engine of the camper started to splutter. Before we had gone a few metres, the camper stalled, then stopped completely…..

I am so happy with the way it has turned out. At first I was a little concerned that I had used such a mish mash of pinks from barely there pale pinks to magenta to hot hot hot pink and as I was putting it together I was having a few misgivings. I kept thinking that I was too liberal with my neutral selections and that my greens were incompatible and on and on I went. Now that it is together I can truly say I love it - thank you Bonnie Hunter! I learned a lot making this quilt top. For instance, I couldn't understand why we were instructed to sew the inner border strips together on an angle (like binding) and pressing them open until I was sewing it to the string blocks. I then realized that there were already so many seams from the string blocks that we didn't need to add more to the mix. This quilt top is far from perfect, I have a few little poofy areas because when I was sewing the blocks together I must have been stretching/easing them together to make them fit and my vertical/horizontal seams don't all align absolutely perfectly but I am okay with that. Once it is quilted and washed it won't be noticeable. I also a had a little bit of trouble when I added the corners to the outer border. In the instructions, Bonnie warned to make sure we had lots of overhang when we added the borders so that we wouldn't lose our corners from the inner border. I thought I had left enough but only one corner turned out correctly - lesson learned. I am not going to change it because I think it looks charming. This was the first mystery quilt I have ever made (and the most challenging) and it will be staying with me! Now I just have to layer, baste and quilt it. years ago that allows us the opportunity to celebrate a Good Friday, Jesus had been brought before Pilate to face false accusations charges against him. Pilate was governor in a region called Judea, it was a dusty outpost of the Roman Empire. Pilate main duty was to maintain the peace, and now he was faced with the possibility of a riot on his hand because the people were demanding the head of Jesus. Although Pilate saw no guilt in him, the people were threatening to report him to Caesar. Pilate knew that such a report accompanied by a riot, could cost him his position and hopes for advancement. This meant that Pilate had to answer what could be the most important question of his life. The question was this, “would he set free this innocent man at the risk of a major uproar in his region, or would he give in to their demands and condemn a man who, he was quite sure was innocent?
The charge was treason, so Pilate asked Jesus directly if he claimed to be the King of the Jews. Jesus’ answer was “yes” but with a qualification attached. Jesus did claim to be a king-to remain silent would be like denying it. Nevertheless, he was not claiming kingship in any way that would threaten Pilate, Caesar, or the Empire. Jesus’ kingship was spiritual. Pilate could sense that the Council’s case was embarrassingly weak and that the solemn rabbi standing before him was unlikely to lead a revolt against Rome. Therefore, Pilate made a critical decision that would forever change the history of the world on that day and we now celebrate it is Good Friday.

Character of modern dining room sets that is easily to be recognized is the use of simple stuff, thin material and also monotonous color. Well, although it seems like very simple, but these elements are really hard to be done, especially when you want to make the furniture by yourself. Most of the people are also argue that the shape of the chair for the dining room is needed to be similar or the same with the shape of the table. Well, this is basically wrong.

It was fitting that his death would be accompanied by a blaze of glory. When MJ was barely five, his father Joseph Jackson acknowledged his talent and knew he’s Got To be There, singing with his brothers in the Jackson 5. He even had something to do with Ben, a soundtrack of a movie about a rat.
MJ was Bad, an enigma who at times acted dangerously; small wonder about the scandals that would dog him in later years. MJ was a thriller; his life was Off the Wall of just his country and placed on the pages of HIStory. MJ, at least at a point, was almost musically Invincible. MJ was often imitated, but he could never be duplicated. MJ would be Forever Michael. He was all about Music and Him. Destiny chose him to be a consummate entertainer. It did not matter whether he was black or white, MJ is the greatest entertainer that ever lived; with over 750 million copies (and still counting) of his albums sold worldwide. Like Rev. Al Sharpton rightly said, “Michael Jackson was a trailblazer and historic figure...It was MJ that brought blacks, White, Blacks, Asians and Latinos together...No controversy will erase the historic impact...Michael Jackson made culture accept a person of colour way before Tiger Woods, way before Oprah Winfrey, way before Barack Obama.”
But MJ was a confused genius that never got rid of his childhood demons. He grew in his body and skill, but never grew in his spirit. He was a victim of a complex that wired him to self destruct. Fame has always been a serial killer, murdering people who never grew out of their closet of insecurity, dysfunctional childhood and the extreme demand of a world that would always want more from their mega-superstars and out of envy and jealousy by a section, would want to milk them dry. In the end, the consummate entertainer was consumed by the stage that transformed him into a global icon. They loved him and hated him. They praised him and criticized him. They lifted him and brought him down.
The toxicology and autopsy report would never reveal this. It’s stale news that MJ’s death was precipitated by many factors. Of course he died suddenly after a cardiac arrest; he was hooked on so many prescription drugs and painkillers. It was a miracle that he even lived this long. He flagrantly disobeyed the laws of nature for so long by trying to restructure his body and thirsting for immortality. How can mere mortal reverse the set standards of immortality? MJ was not just a victim of his own eccentricities; he was a victim of a circle of leeches and vampires disguised as friends. He was sucked up by their pretences until he couldn’t live without pain killers and prescription drugs. But let’s face it. MJ was dead long before he actually died.
Michael Jackson was killed by friends who were not there; in his many, many times of need.
Uri Geller, bestselling author, psychic, motivational speaker and close friend of Michael Jackson, once asked him, “Michael, are you lonely?” He looked at Geller intently and replied, “I am a very lonely man,” But who truly cared? MJ’s so called ‘friends’ left him in the lurch, consumed by loneliness and deluge of insecurities, when they could have helped him in those years of scandals. “It’s amazing to see how many people are now praising him that wouldn’t go near him in the last several years, and condemned him,” Al Sharpton again. “For years, I asked Michael to think about what he was doing and I had hoped he’d get help and stop being around the people he would often accompany himself with. I wish he had listened,” said Geller.
Every man deserve friends who would not abandon them in their days of need; friends who would truly love you even when you have left them far behind in a blaze of glory, just like MJ did, friends who would not be envious of your success and stick with you in scandals even when you’re guilty, friends who would be comfortable telling you the honest truth about issues so as to help you become a better person. “MJ thought us to stand for each other, it’s not about mess, it’s about his love message. MJ beat it, he rose to the top, out sang his cynics, out-danced his doubters” said Al Sharpton at his memorial service. But even the King of Pop, singer, songwriter, dancer extraordinaire, couldn’t out-dance the frailty of mortality.
Many critics would want to blame MJ for allowing many things that happened to him. Maybe it was not his fault. But the price of ‘genius’ and ‘stardom’ could be so great, especially for a man who sees a vicious world through the eyes of a child. “Michael was no freak,” said Al Sharpton, “He was a genius.” True. He was blessed with an extraordinary talent. But talent always come with responsibility. Great talents always come with a high demand for responsibility. Maybe, in the long run, MJ couldn’t handle the pressure on his man-child shoulders. Maybe so many around him took advantage of his childhood heart of innocence. Maybe he refused help from his Family and true Friends. Maybe he got lost in his search for true Faith; because your faith - what you believe, who you believe - would define the essence of your existence; your identity and your value system.
Michael Jackson’s memorial reinforced some timeless truths. (True) FRIENDS matter. Filter your friends. Choose them wisely. Your FAITH matters. Trust your faith. Believe in God. FAMILY is everything. Stick with them, love them unconditionally. Ah that word, love. Love conquers all.
“We had him,” Maya Angelou wrote in memory of MJ. Love him or hate him. At least, we should be grateful to have witnessed such talent and genius in our time. People like Michael Jackson happen once a two lifetimes. Almost a million fans had bought tickets in anticipation of the greatest comeback ever in musical history. “This is it,” MJ himself said when his planned 50 concerts at the O2 Arena in London was announced. It really was it. The King of Pop, the greatest entertainer who ever lived, had no time for an encore.

Long ago I was a super woman with a cape and a torch and work to be done and wars to win. Eshet Lapidot-(Torch Woman) was my hashtag. God provided the spark. Baby on my hip and one on my lap. I Listened and judged while the babes (your moms) nursed and napped. Under the palm tree day after day, this one told me his tzores and that one complained of his neighbors. The Rabbis thought I sat under that palm tree outside because it was proper and more appropriate, but the truth was it was hard enough keeping the house tidy with my crazy working hours and an active family and I didn’t want everybody traipsing in with their dirty, dusty feet. I got good at the judging gig and the people listened to me and trusted me and my reputation grew.
In the meantime life was tough for us, once again we were under the rule of the Cannaites who oppressed us and we cried out to God. God answered and I got called into action. It didn’t seem to make much difference to God that I was a female. If you’ve read the text you’ll see it just says, “and Devorah was a woman prophetess” no parades or big speeches about it. I was ready.
Now came the ultimate test. A battle to regain our sovereignty. This battle was as big as Joshua’s battle. The odds were against us. General Sisera had all the modern tools of warfare- nine hundred iron chariots and tons of soldiers. It was hard to convince your Saba Barak to enter the battle. I actually lost my patience with him and said some words that turned out to be true, but I do regret saying them. I prophesized that Sisera would meet his demise at the hand of a woman. I admit, I have a sharp tongue. In the end, I had to go down to the battle field with him which raised a couple of eyebrows.
I didn’t have a choice, I was commissioned by the Almighty to get this battle off the ground. I have to hand it to Saba he wasn’t this big macho guy falling apart or giving up just because I had knocked his masculinity just an itsy bitsy bit. He proved himself on the battlefield leading ten thousand soldiers from various tribes against Sisera’s forty thousand men. I was there strictly for strategy, moral support, war cries and so on. It was an incredible battle, we didn’t lose one man and Sisera’s army was demolished, finished, kaput. Saba, the army and I all worked our butts off, but this was no human victory. The weather changed “the earth trembled and the heavens dripped.” And to top it all, out of nowhere came Yael and her tent pin fulfilling my prophecy and killing Sisera. It was a little brutal, and frankly I was happy to keep my own hands clean.
I am telling you when we finished we were on a battle high. We were jumping and dancing and then we sang. Saba Barak and I sang this poem. It came out spontaneously, together we just opened our mouths and through our laughter and tears we sang. I called myself “Mother of Israel” and I did rip into some of those tribes who had shirked their duty. I held a grudge or two. But I never forgot that our victory was due to the Almighty. I was a super woman, but I was human. The rabbis say that I lost my gift of prophecy because I was arrogant. The truth is I didn’t need it anymore. The people returned to God and there were forty years of peace and Saba and I went home.
So Chamoodim, have some cookies. I’ll show you my cape and my torch again. The flame is now an ember. We’ll keep it alive, you and me and Saba and your children when they grow up. You never know when we might have to raise the torch again. You never know when you might need a super hero, you never know when you might be called upon to be that super hero. But now my dears, it is time to go to sleep. Sweet dreams.

Never would you think that someone achieving teleportation to another city is real. I must say though, Science has come a long way in such a short space of time. Asking if teleportation will ever become reality, is a good question to ask.
Teleportation
The idea of teleportation is to change a physical object into a signal and transmit this signal to somewhere else where it is then reassembled. This has already been done…kind of. By altering this definition by a small amount we have been able to teleport, yes.
Teleportation in REAL LIFE
In fact, this altered definition of teleportation has recently allowed for scientists in China to teleport a photon from Earth into Space. Although a photon is not a physical object, it’s a start, and could revolutionize all sorts of things which I will discuss later on. First, we must dive back into the realm of Quantum Physics to understand how this teleportation actually worked.
The Alien World of Quantum Physics
It doesn’t sound nice, I know, but I will make this as understandable as I can for you readers. The problem with Quantum Physics, is that it defies logic. They say that if you believe that you understand Quantum Physics, then you don’t understand it at all. The more you learn about it; the more it confuses you. Quantum Entanglement is certainly not an exception.
Quantum Entanglement
Having said how crazy quantum can get; quantum entanglement is when you have two particles that are physically separated from each other – yet they still have some sort of connection between them [1]. This connection allows them to influence each other instantaneously – on any scale you want. Imagine you are here on Earth; and on the other side of the Universe you have a person who is ‘entangled’ to you – If you clap, the person on the other side of the Universe also claps… instantaneously.
Sounds completely alien right? Surprisingly, it has been proven with quantum particles over and over again. This is incredibly shocking, as on a large scale of distance, this passage of information would break the fastest possible speed in the Universe – the speed of light. This defies the laws of Physics. So how does this relate to how the scientists in China managed to teleport a photon 300 miles, from Earth into Space?
Quantum Entanglement and Teleportation relation
This teleportation that the Scientists did, was not quite the disappearing of something that reappears elsewhere, magically – but the production of an exact copy of that something with its information, by the means of quantum entanglement. Let me explain.
Imagine looking into a mirror. If you wave your hand at it, your reflection waves back. In quantum entanglement terms; you are entangled with your reflection (‘entangled’ means you are connected in a “spooky” way no one knows of yet) – so by altering your information (by waving), due to this entanglement, your reflection alters theirs instantly – producing an exact copy of your wave, thus, your reflection waves back at you. As a result, your waving hand has teleported to your reflection. Still don’t get it? This very short video will definitely help you out.
This is how the photon was teleported into Space by the scientists. Mind bending, right? That’s the Quantum world for you.
Will teleportation on a large physical scale ever occur?
With the technology we now have, probably not. By using quantum entanglement – teleportation has been done with atoms, but not with anything bigger. It becomes too complex as you can imagine, but by no means am I saying it is impossible – it could be done.
What can this quantum teleportation help us with if we were to achieve it?
If we can’t teleport a McDonalds directly to our beds, what’s the point of this so called ‘achievement’ – why is it a breakthrough? Turns out, this form of teleportation has a huge impact – especially in the world of computers. If data was teleported from computer to computer using quantum entanglement, it would be IMPOSSIBLE to hack that signal since it is nowhere in between the two computers, at all – therefore, you cannot grasp it [2].
This is a significant step into developing a quantum internet, which is an internet that is impossible to hack, an internet which transmits data instantly across the world. An internet where downloading and uploading speeds do not become a problem anymore. No more kicking your internet router – bid farewell to lag.
The innovation that is to happen in the future is very uncertain, and we are at the brink of doing amazing things we never thought of doing. Here’s to the future. are Quantum Computers?” – Episode 3 (FOR BEGINNERS!)

Opinion - Egypt Crisis:Unpacking the Role of the Media and Gulf Petro-Dollars
If there is one thing that consistently defines this era that we are living in, it is the role of the media in how it not only shapes our politics, ideology and world view but also how it seeks to manipulate issues and narratives for its own goals. We all remember the concerted media campaign that preceded the invasion of Iraq in 2003. The political establishment and a large proportion of the general public were convinced that Iraq had a viable nuclear and chemical arsenal. The orchestrated media campaign by traditionally respectable media outlets like the BBC and the Sky Middle Eastern coverage tended to stoke-up fear in the hearts of the population. Some politicians genuinely believed that unless there was a pre-emptive attackon Saddam Hussain, our civilisation and our way of ’’life’’ were in mortal danger. We all know too well the consequences of the invasion. Likewise the Leveson Inquiry in the UK has called to question media ethics.
With the crises and incidents unfolding in Egypt, truth is once again the main victim -- in the absence of real democratic institutions and an inherently-corrupt and unprofessional media. The loss of life over the past week -- whilst utterly shocking -- veers into insignificance compared to the web of lies that have been spun around to justify these killings by the government officials and those who back the military operation. What is even worse is the reception these lies seem to be getting in the West as figures are misquoted and justifications reiterated.
The flow of information from the official sources should not be taken at face value. Western leniency with the coup leaders in Egypt encouraged the army and security services to massacre hundreds of demonstrators in the streets of Cairo. These crimes were preceded by an unbelievable array of propaganda willingly reiterated by American and British officials in their briefings in the past few weeks. Take for example the American official who reaffirmed the outrageous Egyptian claim that 30 million people took to the streets of Cairo on the eve of June 30th to call for a military intervention and end Morsi’s rule.
The influence of the mass media on ordinary people in the Middle East is widely acknowledged. In the Egyptian case, money from the UAE and Saudi Arabia has fuelled a frenzied media attack on the nascent democratic institutions in Egypt to the extent that ordinary citizens were willing to sacrifice theirvote and political freedoms in order to end their miserable economic and social situation, so they were led to believe. Paradoxically the Saudi and the Arab Gulf states concentrated in their media campaign on the issue of the Western conspiracy with the Muslim Brotherhood to destabilise Egypt and sell its assets to foreign investors. They played on the ordinary people’s sentiments and religious sensitivities. They even claimed that the new democratic government in Egypt is in cahoots with the West and the Israelis.
Unfortunately most of the information about opposition movements in the Arab and Muslim world available to Western circles was amassed from security services and academic institutions linked to it. It was only in the last 30 years when large number of political activists and academics took refuge in the West that we saw certain changes in attitude towards a relative understanding of political Islam. At the same time the exposure to Western political theory and practice had a huge influence on the politics of the proponents of contemporary political Islam. The same strategy is followed by monarchic regimes and sheikhdoms in the Arab Gulf region. Although these regimes are considered pro-West, they support and give sustenance to religious clergy faithful to the regimes to demonise all what the Western democracies stand for. In the case of Egypt, we have witnessed how traditionally apoliticaland rejectionist trends like the Salafists have been used to defend and justify the military coup. Similarly, the head of Al-Azhar University, the most prestigious religious institution in the Muslim world, has not been spared. Here again, Western political, cultural and ethical ideals are the target. A barrier is erected between their people and international concepts such as democracy and free will.
The Egyptian military and the Gulf regimes used religious and cultural cleavages with the West to end the infant democratic experience. Unfortunately, they succeeded with an undeniable tacit approval by democratic governments in the West. This is evident of Western ancient religious sensitivities being undoubtedly intertwined with their contemporary politics.

Western Europe imported
Georgia imports almost everything, and preferably from the West. Three-quarters of the products found in an average Georgian household are imported. If Georgians could, they would import the whole West, since the West, as Saakashvili used to say, is Georgia’s “destiny written in history”. Europe was here already in ancient times when Prometheus was suffering on the hillsides of the Caucasus and the Argonauts were searching for the Golden Fleece in Colchis. Europe was here in the early Middle Ages when King Mirian III accepted Christianity at the hands of St Nino and when Europe proper was full of Asians. While it is true that Europe was not here during the Enlightenment – when the revolution was burning in France, the Persians were burning Tbilisi – or in the post-war Soviet Union, when today’s Georgia was the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic, governmental slogans still proudly proclaim that “Europe began here”.
After the collapse of the Soviet Union the West indeed received diplomatic notes calling for help to “support the descendants of the mythic Kartlos, the great grandson of Japheth, the son of Noah, the symbolic ancestor of Indo-Europeans”. However, it never crossed NATO’s collective mind to intervene in any of the civil conflicts which were erupting at that time throughout the former Soviet Union, Georgia included. It was Saakashvili who finally understood that the West would not come on its own and definitely not move 3,000 kilometres eastward. The West – Saakashvili thought – had to be impressed. Hence, the conclusion: Georgia had no choice but to start resembling the West.
Mimicking the West
The traces of the Soviet legacy, a thorn in Saakashvili’s side, can be found throughout Georgia. “Dictatorships are grey and democracies colourful”, the former president used to say. It turned out, however, that it was not so easy to cover up the decaying post-Soviet blocs with self-made balconies clinging for life with a layer of paint, or to push away side-street bazaars to replace them with fancy supermarkets; or to just hide everything Soviet behind glitzy giant billboards. As the opportunity arose, the statues of several unwanted heroes and despite protests a large chunk of the legacy of Soviet modernism were quickly removed.
It took Saakashvili a couple of years to pepper the country with post-modernist wonders: a pixelated shopping centre here, a police station in the shape of a glass pyramid there; not to mention the hotel which resembles the shape of an Alexandrian lantern, or the ER building that looks like a Wi-Fi router with a large antennae. These are all different buildings, but the context is the same. And the unique post-Soviet characteristics of cheap construction practices allow for the use of remnants of insulation foam to build a moat, hollow bricks to erect an embankment, or old rusty weapons for fencing. One thing is sure though, when Europe is approaching, there is no time to waste.
The architectural Blitzkrieg touched the capital city above all. The goal was to clean up the ruined alleys of the old town in the shortest amount of time possible and create a new life in old Tbilisi. Not surprisingly, UNESCO was wringing its hands when centuries-old buildings were replaced by grotesque replicas covered with gargantuan adornments resembling random elements of the traditional constructions. What is more, this was all taking place in a city, which has existed since the fifth century has experienced many fires and earthquakes (naturally after each of them some things survived but some things had to be built anew), and has been inhabited by numerous ethnic groups (Armenians, Kurds, Jews and Russians among them) who all made Tbilisi a cosmopolitan capital of the region. Even Stalin did not have Misha’s guts to touch this palimpsest-like city. His investors also had their methods to rid homes of their tenants. It was harder to find new ones, though. Thus, today it is only tourists who climb the brightly illuminated yet abandoned walkways below the Narikala fortress.
In Kutaisi, the medieval Bagrati Cathedral experienced a similarly cruel fate. After its glitzy reconstruction with a heavy application of concrete and plastic, the building was removed from the UNESCO cultural heritage list in July 2017; it had been placed on it in 2010 as an endangered world heritage site. Meanwhile, Georgia’s first capital, Mtskheta, also followed suit when a German-like micro-centre, with intersecting rows of souvenir shops, all in a balanced colour scheme of beige and grey, was built round the Svetitskhoveli Cathedral, which seats the highest authorities of the Georgian Orthodox Church. Finally, Signagi, a provincial town famous for its vineyards, was rebuilt in a Mediterranean style.
A part of Europe
The apogee of the architectural madness is the city of Batumi, which in recent years has turned into something that looks like a buggy simulation of Las Vegas. Its coastal promenades, which have still not come to terms with the collapse of the Soviet Union, are now decorated with colourful palm trees, while the building façades are not to be seen behind a chain of neon lights. Since the launch of the visa-free regime with Turkey, the service sector of the city was tightly filled with brothels and casinos, which are both illegal across the border. Georgia’s northern neighbours were also not forgotten, as the moonshine-filled fountains were erected.
Drawing by Andrzej Zaręba
Overall, Batumi’s landscape is now marked by a new architecture that is as eccentric as it is suspiciously symbolic. Like a sail-shaped skyscraper, even though Batumi’s sailing is limited to one shiny yet desolate luxurious yacht club, or a tower made of entwined letters from the Georgian alphabet forming a DNA helix which sends a worrisome ideological message. There is also a miniature of the White House flipped upside down, which constitutes a surprising, although probably unintended, criticism of the blind imitation of American models. All this is in the vicinity close to the old town.
There, new buildings stylised as old were tucked between the 19th century tenement houses, while the old buildings were renovated in such a way as to match the new ones. That is, it is only the fronts that match, as nobody can see anything from the backyard. The place where one can see a lot, meaning the very centre of the old town, a map of Europe was hanging for some time where Georgia was marked with highlighted red contours. “Georgia is a part of Europe”, the map read. Conspicuously, it was missing the Iberian Peninsula – most likely due to the lack of space.
Not all Georgians can afford to travel and enjoy the country’s fast turnover to the West. Therefore the authorities decided that the “New Georgia” would be photographed and the pictures will be published in an album that would be later handed to its citizens. The album was also released in the West. There was, however, a risky possibility that the photographs would not satisfy western judges and they would decide to come for an inspection.
In that case, something had to be done with the locals. As part of Saakashvili’s social engineering plan, Georgia employed thousands of English language teachers, as well as volunteers, activists, students, NGO workers and hipsters of all sorts. To get the latter was not particularly difficult. When Warsaw, Prague or Bucharest – not to mention Berlin – were flooded with the European funds, the cities also lost lots of their exotic charm.
Charm was still to be found in Tbilisi, which still offers a great deal of exoticness, but also allows one to escape from it and find refuge in an increasing number of urban cafés which are popular hang-outs for the expats and the fast growing creative middle class. Here, no one praises Georgian cuisine. It is rather in good humour to mock the new bridge and say that it looks like a glass sanitary pad, or laugh at the “euro-renovations” – as Tbilisi has been obsessed with adapting apartments to what is believed to be European standards. Thus you hear stories about a rented flat that has a shower with a radio and hydro-massager, but no working drains, or a studio where new windows are installed, but the excess of insulating foam busted their frame.
City life in Tbilisi – which according to local knowledge, has existed for at least 200 years – looks more like what you would see in Europe, and makes it look different from Istanbul, Odesa or St Petersburg. It is no wonder, then, that the West got a little carried away with its preaching. In fact it went one step further by not just limiting itself to the routine observation of government’s actions, rural youth programmes or summer EU law schools.
As a result, upon the initiative of volunteers from the European Voluntary Service, an alternative cultural centre was opened in an abandoned hippodrome. There young Georgians were shown films about squatting and were patiently told why they did not necessarily have to respect the police and democratic institutions (although they had just learnt to respect them) and that hard work will not necessarily lead to career or financial success (although they had just started to believe that).
Luxury for Georgian diaspora
Close to Batumi, near the administrative boundary line with Abkhazia, a small village was meant to be turned into Lazika – an ultra-luxurious coastal metropolis. And as the imitation of Europe no longer impressed anyone, the imitations of the Asian tigers could have. Lazika was named after a former kingdom, one of the incarnations of Colchis, which included, of course, Abkhazia. Abkhazia is a Georgian province which enjoyed autonomy during the Soviet times but Georgians claimed their rights to it during the wave of pro-independence nationalism. As a result of the civil war, Abkhazia declared itself as an independent (yet unrecognised) para-state.
Saakashvili wanted to impress the Abkhaz with his tanks, but when this did not work he came up with the idea for Lazika. “Five- and seven-star hotels instead of trenches, the best aqua parks in Europe instead of land mines” were his promises as he was looking at Abkhazia, the post-apocalyptic ruins of a Soviet spa. The only problem was that even if he really delivered on his promises and attracted Abkhaz with seven-star hotels – and was able to beat the competition of the fast developing Sochi, which was right on the other side – there were still not enough people to inhabit the city. Misha, as always, had a solution – the Georgian diaspora will return and start living there.
Despite his ingenuity however, the former president found no remedy for the topography of the terrain. In his opaque calculations, as it was pointed out by local NGOs, he did not include the cost of building skyscrapers on mud and sand dunes. In a realistic scenario, Lazika would have cost Georgia around one billion US dollars, this is for a country whose annual GDP is only $16 billion.
Saakashvili’s plans were thwarted by electoral defeat. Surrounded by subtropical greenness – as in this part of Georgia new buildings do not sink in the continental mud – a town hall and a bridge were built, at the end of which stood a 30-metre statue resembling a tank with a barrel directed towards the unwanted neighbour. The connotation is not accidental, given the fact that the military vehicles produced in Georgia were given the same name – Lazika.
The new Georgian
Saakashvili, the great reformer and a favourite of western diplomats, survived ten years in power. When the opposition began to gather steam, the president did not live up well to democratic standards. He began sending police forces to crush protests, which only made matters worse. The end came when evidence was leaked to the media that serious cases of torture were taking place in state prisons. Georgians listened to Saakashvili carefully, already knowing that European countries look differently.
However, it would be unfair to say that Saakashvili did not deliver anything. A number of radical neoliberal reforms, combined with domestic entrepreneurship, brought about economic growth. And it was during Saakashvili’s government when Georgia’s tourist boom began. Georgia also built a system which closely resembled the rule of law and corruption was significantly reduced from everyday life. The old post-Soviet cadres in the police departments and local governments were exchanged. But Georgia’s American dream lasted only for a few years. It was quickly interrupted by Russian embargoes, the war and Saakashvili’s authoritarian tendencies. Georgians were hit by the costs of transformation.
The authors of the Georgian shock therapy cannot be proud of its effects. The “New Georgia” was a country for a “New Georgian”, a legal entity, but not a real person. The new labour code, which focused on entrepreneurs but somehow forgot about the workers, was a clear reflection of this approach.
The “New Georgian”, in Saakashvili’s understanding, was meant to become a Homo economicus, meaning an ideal citizen of a capitalist state, entrepreneurial and resourceful. Someone who takes matters in his or her own hands and does not expect any support from the state. While Saakashvili’s reforms did indeed help many honest businesspeople build the foundations for the emerging Georgian middle class, they are still in the minority. Those who succeeded got stuck in a limbo, an interim form of existence.
They are a Homo post-sovieticus. On the one hand, they nostalgically reminisce about the Soviet Union and on the other hand, they are overpowered by dreams of consumption. Stagnation, which has tormented the country as a result of western sanctions against Russia, neither allows for the reconstruction of a social security system, nor for running a successful business operation.
The Georgian Dream
The Georgian Dream party came to power in 2012, thanks to socially-oriented slogans and resistance to Saakashvili’s growing authoritarianism. In 2016 the party was re-elected for a second term, receiving 49 per cent of the vote (with a low turnout of 52 per cent). Its politicians did not shy away from the pro-European slogans, despite softening relations with Russia. Despite some scandals (as the recent kidnapping of opposition Azerbaijani journalist painfully testifies), one can say, overall, that democracy in Georgia is relatively stable.
The Georgian Dream even managed to implement several pro-social reforms. It introduced basic universal health care, slightly increased state pensions and lowered utility bills. At the same time, the party has continued with Saakashvili’s focus on making Georgia a business-friendly state, which means low wages in the public sector or the absence of labour laws in the private sector. Even the party’s name, referring to the mythical American Dream, shows that the notion of “from rags to riches” is still alive in Georgian politics. However, economic stagnation and a lack of perspectives for change has deepened frustration and indifference among its citizens.
The Georgian dream of Europe is still strong despite the fact the current geopolitical situation leaves the country without much hope of EU or NATO accession. The question remains what can Georgians be offered beyond a visa-free regime which was introduced in March? Over the years, politicians across the spectrum have promised voters that the Europe they have dreamed of was within reach; once they become Homines economici, when they take matters in their own hands and when the developers finish constructing parks with new fancy buildings. European politicians and investors nodded in agreement. It is clear that this scenario is far from being realisable. It is hard to say which colonisation projects Europe should be more ashamed of – the completed ones or those that have been left behind, and remain unfinished.

This text was originally published in New Eastern Europe issue 5/2017.And so to the third installment of my ’11 before 11.11.2011′ indie publishing venture.
The Very Thought of You first came to public attention in the Minerva anthology New Writing 3
, edited by Andrew Motion and Candice Rodd. Back then it was called Eyes Averted and was a taut 2,500 word literary short about a boy who falls in love with an old man’s dead wife.
It was one of my first pieces of fiction to be published and no small achievement for a writer who was a university student at the time.
I had the good fortune to read the story to a lunch-time audience at the Birmingham Readers & Writers festival, sharing a platform with Andrew Motion, Jim Crace and Michèle Roberts, all of whom expressed admiration for the way I’d held the audience with the story.
I naturally thought literary stardom was just around the corner. Perhaps it wasn’t the best month to emigrate to Hungary and disappear off everyone’s radar.
As successful as that story was, the frustrating thing about it was that it had been mined from a much longer novella that examined the relationship between Jez and Harold in the wider context of the visiting centre, with its array of characters, and that depth was sacrificed for intensity.
Incidentally — and to most people this is going to make me sound like a time travelling Victorian — that original novella was written so long ago that it only exists on actual paper, written with a typewriter, rescued from a cardboard box in which it has been filed for twenty-two years.
And this is the beauty of the whole indie-publishing revolution. It allows writers to blow the dust off formerly successful stories for which legacy publishing can find no market (read ‘profit’) and allows us to give them new life again.
And that seems so utterly appropriate to the themes and concerns of this timeslip ghost story.
I had also obsessively written and re-written the story as a screenplay (called Fossils at first and later The Very Thought of You). I attempted to sell it as a supernatural drama, but its supernatural elements amounted to little more than a few moments of imagination on Jez’s part, and this blatant misregard for the Trades Descriptions Act raised the ire of at least one agent who’d taken the time to read it on the promise of its advertised genre, a mistake I promised myself never to make again. The story as it was then was plainly not a supernatural drama at all but a mere drama, possibly the most unsaleable genre in film.
So when it came to resurrecting the idea of the novella, stitched Frankenstein-like from the remains of the published short story (which you can read as a free download here), the screenplay and the original novella, I had a moment of inspiration — the kind that strikes you only later with how obvious it was all the time — why not actually, you know, turn it into a supernatural drama?
So here it is, hopefully in a format that raises no feelings of genre betrayal: a timeslip ghost story about a boy who falls in love with an old man’s dead wife.
You can purchase The Very Thought of You as an ebook or paperback edition. For the full list of buying options – including a signed copy direct from the author – go here.
And if you read it and like it, remember to give it a review.

Coral Reef 2018 Wall Calendar
Calendar Information
One of the world's most complicated ecosystems where hundreds of fish species and others can live is a coral reef. Even though these reefs occupy less than one percent of the globe's oceans, a full twenty five percent of fish populations. These 2018 Coral Reef calendars display the wide variety of species and the amazing colors that come with the habitat. These reef fish still suffer attacks from predators, but they have adapted well and can find the tinirst hiding places imaginable to protect themselves. Many of the fish in the Coral Reef 2018 calendars have spines inside their fins, which serves as a defense against predators. The majority of coral reefs are found in concentrated areas such as the Caribbean and Southeast Asia. That Indo-Pacific region is home to eight times as many species as the Caribbean.

Good Product...with good service...go for it...!!!I have always been blaming STRESS for causing havoc to my used-to-be flawless skin. on serious recalling, I have been constantly battling with this acne for the past one year. Oh gosh! The thought of it made me fumed! I thought acne only occurs in adolescent and not adults?
Recently with the results of my cleanser's pH testing, it made me wonder why the huge variant in pH readings between Ettusais Medicated Soap (pH9) and The Body Shop Tea Tree Facial Wash (pH6) which I have been diligently using for the pass 6 months.
I usually uses TBS Tea Tree Facial Wash for morning, as I find it less harsh and more moisturising. As for Ettusais Medicated Soap, it for use at night, right after proper cleansing oil method. Somehow the Ettusais manages to leave my skin real clean but rather drying which I quickly hydrate with my Vichy Thermal Facial Mist (I am horrified that it has a pH9, which I will be discussing more in my next post). Its really horrible to think of how much my skin has to recover to pH5.5 after using the Ettusais Medicated Soap. And it made me realised now, how important it is to apply the Ettusais Acne Version Up (pH6) and Ettusais Acne Aqua Shooter (pH5) immediately instead of Vichy Thermal Facial Mist! I cant imagine the amount of bacteria multiplying on my face! Oh yucks!!!
I came across Beauty Credit skin shower story promoting cleansers with pH8.8. This really confuses and contradict my previous findings from ezinearticles.com
Something caught my eye while my brain is trying to logic it out. Cleansers with pH < 5.5 is moisturising but poor cleansing power. Didn't I just review the TBS Tea Tree Facial Wash, commenting that it was less harsh and very moisturising? The main reason why I hate to use it after makeup removal is because it leaves a layer of silky feeling which I find it does not cleanses well. But its great to use it in the morning. Next, cleansers with pH > 8.8 has stronf cleansing power yet causes dryness. Yes! That is exactly what Ettusais Medicated Soap did! It made my skin so dry that prompted me use facial mist.
Despite the table of benefit on cleanser with pH8.8, I seriously need to test it before I can say it works! I am very tempted to buy it yet rather hesitant about cleansers with pH > 8.00. Any advise from readers using Beauty Credit Skin Shower pH8.8? Pls share your review with us by leaving your link at the comments.

There are a lot of views on skincare, just like the age-old argument about moisturisers and oily skin. Some believe that you should reduce or even do away with moisturisers if you have oily skin, while others claim that you need to moisturise more so that your skin won't need to produce more oil to do the job.
For the pH level issue, Somang Korea figured that it's pointless to have a super-gentle cleanser that sacrifices cleaning power. Somang can't claim that pH 8.8 is the "best" pH level, but based on their research it is the most "balanced" when tested on a majority of people.
My advice is the same for anyone who asks me if such-and-such skincare is right for them - try it yourself first. We have testers available for (almost) every product at all our stores, and some we even have sample sachets for you to try at home. Please check with our staff for availability first, though. - Beauty CreditDescription

...... with this thing called Grief.
I don't think it feels the same way about me. It just exists.
But I ...... I mostly hate it.
And yet sometimes, in the midst of feeling that hate, I think I also feel a little bit of love.
Which is probably as hard to understand as it is to explain.
But permit me to try.
This past weekend Son #3 and I went to Oklahoma to attend another home football game at my university (and soon to be his university).
At Jim's AND my university.
Where we met.
And fell in love.
Where it all started.
We visited it several times over the years, taking the kids when we could ...... and taking our yearly Christmas card picture there on our Thanksgiving trips back "home".
I absolutely loved college.
And it is forever linked in my mind with Jim.
Even though we didn't meet until the second semester of our junior year.
We are all three linked.
Forever, in my mind.
So when I walk on the campus ...... it's wonderful.
And yet hard.
Very hard.
There have been a lot of renovations over the past 5 years.
The campus is even more beautiful than it used to be.
Saturday I was walking across it with my very good friend who's known me since we were both 17. Before college.
Before Jim.
After becoming his wife.
After becoming a mom.
Times six.
She knew me in my "before".
And she's been there for me in my "after".
I know that she misses the "before Janine" as much as I do.
And she misses Jim.
Anyway, as we were walking and looking at the new Student Union, my mind ...... even after almost 5 years ...... went "there".
You know the "there" I'm talking about.
My brain, for just a second, thought, "I need to take pictures so that I can show Jim how beautiful this is."
And for a moment, I hated that.
I hated the tears that stung my eyes as I tried my best to fight them.
I hated the lump that formed in my throat after I told my friend what had just happened.
And I hated the grief that gripped my heart, and made me wonder if my mind will ever stop going "there".
But then, I stopped hating it.
And I loved the fact that I still love him so much that my heart breaks when I forget my reality for just a second.
That I love him so much that the missing of him still brings tears.
I know that I will never forget him ...... and that I will never stop missing him.
But sometimes, if I stop and think about it, I feel afraid that I will forget.
That would be the worst thing I could now experience.
I know that I won't ...... and yet I fear that I will.
I know that I don't have to explain that contradiction to you.
So thank you for that.
Whenever grief grips my heart and brings back that ache ...... I know for certain that I won't forget.
Not while he's around ...... my old companion Grief.
And I know that he'll be around forever.
He's not as young and strong as he once was ...... which is a good thing. He can't impact me the way he used to (which I hope gives you hope).
But he still has the ability to make an impact.
He still has the ability to make me miss Jim so very much.
And he has the ability to take that fear away.
And that makes me love him.
Just a little bit.
So yes, we have a love/hate relationship.
Or at least I do.
Unfortunately for most of you, Grief is not very monogamous.
Which is another reason to love/hate him.
In my mind anyway.
Janine,
you always say it EXACTLY how it is.
Thank you for that.
Thank you, Anon.
I'm glad that my posts connect with you.
I've always tried to write the truth about grief, no matter how ugly it is ...... and we all know that it can be hugely ugly.
Thank you for taking the time to encourage me.
:)
I have described my grief as being in an abusive relationship. You know you're going to get hit, and that it's going to hurt like hell - you just never know when or what is going to set it off. I've never thought about the love part - thank you for that.
Anon,
That's a perfect description of Grief. It is an abusive relationship. I never really thought of it like that. Thank you for sharing that with the rest of us.
I appreciate it.
:)
Nice post. Thank you.
Thank you, Anon, for taking the time to say that.
I appreciate it.
:)
Again another great post. At almost two years out ( 19 days) I too feel that. I have changed the house to be me, but its still him. His mother told me I would forget him, how cruel this lady was. I will never forget the love that man gave me and I gave back. I wont forget that at times he knew me better than I did, and he accepted it all. I too loved him for who he was and I will never forget. I too hate/love this relationship with grief.
Jackie
Hi Jackie,
Thank you so much for telling us your experience. I'm sorry that your mother in law said such a horrible thing. I have no idea why some peoples' mind works like that. I know that it goes deeper than the surface, but I don't get it.
How does anyone think it's possible for us to forget the most important person in the world to us?
It's not.
And I'm glad.
Thanks for your encouragement.
:)
Nicely put. While I am fresh - just 4 months out...I have done a lot and made a lot of changes. Which was what he told me to do. And while things have changed, in essence they have remained the same...the house is me, but him...the food is me, but him...how I do things is me, but him...How in the world can we ever forget the loves of our lives?
I hate grief because it makes me feel. In the same way I love it.
Thanks, I needed this!
Sue
Sue,
I'm sorry that you have a reason to be here, but I'm glad that you are. I wish that I'd had a community like this when I was 4 months out.
I'm glad that you've done so much and made a lot of changes. You know that's what your husband wanted for you. What a great guy.
Thanks for taking the time to share with us and to encourage me.
:)
I like this perspective.
It is a creative and insightful twist on the pain that grief brings. I am going to try to incorporate this view into my journey.
On a side note, two of my sons now attend the university that my husband and I met at age 18...it certainly does bring with it bitter-sweet memories.
Thank you for this interpretation of grief!
Thank you, Coveparent. Thank you for coming here and reading .... and for commenting. We really never know if we're making an impact or not unless the readers comment. I'm thankful that I could give you a different insight on this road we're all on, but wish we weren't.
I'm sure you, and your husband, are both very proud of your sons and the school they chose to attend. I look forward to being on campus to visit him, knowing that it will always be more difficult for me than for most parents. But the memories, though painful, are still good. And I treasure them.
Thank you for telling me about your sons. And your experience.
:)Tiziano and I went to Ikea today to get a big boy bed for Sebastian. Right now Tiziano and I take turns sleeping in the sofabed downstairs while one of us sleeps with Sebastian. But my mother arrives in a month, and she will need to use the sofa bed, so we need to get him out of our bed and out of our bedroom. We are hoping that the transition will be easier if we can get him excited about joining the world of big people. We are also hoping that sharing a room with Lucas will make him less lonely and desperate for us at night. We are hoping that we are not hoping too unrealistically.
However, of course, Ikea didn't have the bed we wanted in stock, so we had to order it. The guy said it would take 10 days. Ouch! I was starting to look forward to sleeping normally soon. Oh well, another 2 weeks ...
I am trying to enjoy this (hopefully last) time of co-sleeping. When I am not too tired, and I don't have to wake up at 5:30am to go to work, and it isn't my turn to do Lucas's nightfeedings, I actually enjoy sleeping with Sebastian. Nothing as precious as a sleeping child. His little breath, his little peaceful face, his little arms either holding onto his stuffed animals or sprawled across the bed. When he randomly sits up and then snuggles up to me, wanting to be spooned or held or hugged, I just get filled with warm and fuzzy feelings and cascades of fierce protective love.
(Did I already say that this is only sweet when I am not severely sleep-deprived and I do not have to wake up at 5:30am to go to work and it isn't my turn to do Lucas's nightfeedings?)
WORK
I found out today that I will have to go away for work for 2 full days in two weeks. And OMG, I am sooo excited. Isn't it horrible? That means 2 full nights of sleep. That means 2 full days of child-free, care-free, worry-free living. That means 2 days away from it all! I don't care WHAT I have to do when I am away, I am just excited I get to LEAVE! But the bonus is that I will actually finally be able to see Neuschwanstein Castle (Cinderella castle), the castle that I have been wanting to see for the past 20 yrs. Whoop, whoop!!!!
Wednesday, 4 March 2009It took me way too long to figure out a title for this post. Now the word Wednesday and looks odd because I typed it and deleted it so many times.
So you may or may not have heard that I'm suffering from a minor IT band strain. ;-) Thankfully it's not severe and a little time and a whole lot of stretching and foam rolling will heal it. Hopefully.
I have fallen in love with my foam roller. How did I ever live without one?
I attempted another run on the treadmill but with my knee and leg wrapped. I was able to run half a mile without pain then I had to walk for another half mile. I can do no-to-low impact exercises without pain so here's what I did:
20 single leg squats (each leg)
50 regular squats (shook out & stretched after 25)
30 side leg raises (laying on my side)
50 crunches
Topped off with stretching and foam rolling. Injuries have a way of forcing me to strength train. Although I do know how important it is for runners to strength train.
Today while most of the world is probably feasting on turkey we went to lunch at the Grand China buffet. I didn't get any pics of our food. Blogger fail.
I'm hoping to get back to running by the beginning of the year. *Fingers crossed!*
Enjoy the rest of your Wednesday! I have a bed full of laundry that's just begging to be folded. Funny how the only one who hears it is me. -_-
Do you like bunless burgers?
How do you strength train?
I enjoy hearing from everyone so please, leave a comment!Situated in the heart of Gramado, just two blocks from the famous Coberta Street, Hospedagem Saint Peter is a homestay conveniently set a one-minute walk from Gramado Borges Medeiro Avenue.

According to the American Academy of Implant Dentistry, “35 million Americans are missing all their teeth in one or both jaws,” with many more missing one or a few teeth. Living with gaps in your smile can be embarrassing, uncomfortable, and unhealthy. Your teeth are fundamental to your quality of life—you can’t eat, chew, speak, or smile easily without them. Furthermore, if you don’t replace missing teeth, this can lead to a cascade of other oral health issues, as you mouth and jaws adjust to try and fill the space left behind.
In the past, the only solution to missing teeth were restorations like dentures, bridges, and crowns that sat on top of your gums. While they can be beautiful and effective, they do have their downsides. Fortunately, modern technology has revolutionized restorative dentistry for people with missing teeth. At Dr. Cindy Flanagan’s Houston practice, we often assist patients using dental implants. While you’ve likely heard this term in advertisements, from friends, or even at our office, you may not know exactly what dental implants are. That’s why we’ve made this week’s blog post all about dental implants! Read on to learn more about this state-of-the-art tooth technology.
Dental Implants 101
What makes dental implants different from other restorations is the way they’re held in place. As we mentioned above, regular prostheses sit above the gums. Dental implants, on the other hand, are firmly attached to your actual jawbone, just as a natural tooth would be. This is because implant technology replaces not just the tooth, but the tooth’s root. According to WebMD, “dental implants are replacement tooth roots. Implants provide a strong foundation for fixed (permanent) or removable replacement teeth that are made to match your natural teeth.” Dental implants are titanium posts inserted into your jawbone, where they integrate with your existing tissue. Once the posts are placed, we can simply attach any kind of prosthesis to them.
Do You Qualify?
You may be eligible for dental implants if:
- You are missing one or more teeth.
- You have one or more teeth that require extraction. This could be due to injury, fracture, severe decay, gum disease, or some other issue.
- You are in good general health, since the placement of one or more dental implants is a surgical procedure.
- You are in excellent oral and dental health. If you suffer from decay or gum disease, we will need to treat your condition before providing dental implants.
- You have sufficient jawbone tissue for dental implants. Since implants are placed within and fuse to the jawbone, it’s important that you have enough jawbone material to hold them. If you do not, you may be able to undergo a preparatory procedure to help you qualify for dental implants.
Dr. Flanagan will examine your mouth, go over your records, discuss the procedure with you, take X-rays, and perform any other needed diagnostic tests to determine if you are a good candidate for dental implants.
Benefits of Dental Implants
There are numerous advantages to restoring your smile with sophisticated implant technology. Dental implants can improve your:
- Comfort. Regular restorations, particularly dentures, can shift around in your mouth, irritating your gums and knocking against any remaining teeth. Dental implants are designed like a natural tooth, stable and secure.
- Oral health. Dental implants hold prostheses to your jawbone, rather than securing them with surrounding teeth. WebMD explains: “dental implants don’t require reducing [shaving down] other teeth, as a tooth supported bridge does. Because nearby teeth are not altered to support the implant, more of your own teeth are left intact, improving long-term oral health. Individual implants also allow easier access between teeth, improving oral hygiene.” In addition to these important factors, dental implants are durable, so you’ll have to undergo fewer treatments to keep them in good shape.
- Ability to eat. Regular restorations can move around in your mouth when you try to eat. They may even loosen or fall out if you eat more chewy, sticky, hard, or otherwise difficult foods. You don’t have to worry about this with dental implants.
- Appearance. Dental implants feel more like teeth within your mouth, and they also look natural, especially with our beautiful crowns, bridges, and dentures.
- Speech. Typical restorations can slide around in your mouth as you talk, making it more difficult to enunciate clearly. This is not the case with dental implants, since these are rooted to your jawbone.
- Quality of life. All of the above benefits make your day-to-day activities easier, allowing you to relax and enjoy your life more.

Asian Turkey Sliders with Cilantro mayo and slaw
I had a goal to get my readers as many “tailgating” recipes as possible before Sunday. Admittedly, life sometimes gets in the way of my
hopes and dreams… ooops, I meant to say, recipe goals LOL. But this week, I was able to put these together, pretty quickly by the way. I think they’d be a great addition to your game day party platter. You can absolutely put them together the day before or early morning and grill them off as you need them. It doesn’t take very long to cook them through. I like to grill them on medium low heat to keep the turkey moist.
Ingredients:
1-2 lbs ground turkey breast
2 tsp freshly grated ginger
3 cloves grated garlic
3 Tbs teriyaki sauce
3 Tbs soy sauce
1 large egg
¼-1/2 cup breadcrumbs. Just enough to bind the mixture.
1 Tbs onion powder
Black pepper (soy sauce has enough sodium, no need to add additional salt)
Dash crushed red pepper
3 whole scallions chopped
1 cup any thick teriyaki marinade. I like Soy Vay Hoisin Garlic.
Bakery Dinner Rolls
Mayonnaise
1 cup mayo
1 lime
Bunch cilantro
2 scallions chopped
Slaw – From SimplyRecipes.com
Zest and juice of 1 lime
Chopped fresh cilantro
Slaw:
I found this recipe on Simply Recipes
. The only change I made was I added the zest and juice of a lime. Here is her recipe:
. The only change I made was I added the zest and juice of a lime. Here is her recipe:.
Mayo:
Mix the mayo, cilantro, scallions and zest and juice of one lime. Refrigerate
Sliders:
Mix all slider ingredients in large bowl. Use your hands to gently incorporate all ingredients. Try not to overwork the meat mixture. Once mixed, begin making small patties a little larger than the size of your dinner rolls. Lay out on baking sheet. Brush one side of the sliders with marinade, turn and brush the other side.
Grill the sliders on medium low and continue to baste with the marinade on both sides. The sliders should be cooked to at least 165 degrees. I also served these with sweet potato fries (the frozen kind!)Mall-ternatives: Thanksgiving Weekend Shopping
This is it — shopping's big moment. What used to only be one major shopping event the day after Thanksgiving has now grown into a whole weekend and some change, with Cyber Monday and Giving Tuesday. Since we know what to expect at the mall, here's a breakdown of ways to shop small this weekend.
Black Friday
The phrase alone evokes a packed mall or people camping out in front of big-box stores, but luckily for those who want to avoid that madness, a few indie businesses are having deals that day too.
If the Skatepark of Tampa seems like an unlikely place to shop, think again. They have one of the best sneaker selections in Tampa Bay, as well as apparel and all things skateboard, natch. They're having a sale in the shop and free skating all day to celebrate. They'll open at 7 a.m. Friday and the first five people in line get free stuff. 4215 E Columbus Drive, Tampa. (813) 621-6793. skateparkoftampa.com.
Record stores are getting in on the Black Friday action, too, making it a second Record Store Day of sorts. St. Petersburg's Planet Retro Records will have a huge assortment of limited indie exclusive titles along with a storewide sales on new and used vinyl. They'll make it a party with live music and beer. 9 a.m. 226 Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. St. N. (727) 218-7434. planetretrorecords.com.
Small Business Saturday
American Express created this day in 2010 as a way to remind people to shop small during the holidays.
The indie market model makes it easy for a number of small businesses to get exposure, which is exactly what the Shopapalooza Festival is all about. More than 130 locally owned shops, restaurants, art galleries, nonprofits and community organizations will post up at St. Petersburg's South Straub Park from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday. shopapaloozafestival.com.
Tampa's Seminole Heights neighborhood is full of small businesses near each other, so it's only natural they'd get together to have a Holiday Shop Hop on Small Business Saturday. Visit at least six of them from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., including the Disco Dolls Studio, Urban Bungalow and Phoenix Glass Studio, for a chance to win prizes. After, they'll have a block party at the Graham Building (6701 Florida Ave.) to award prizes and raise funds for the Lowry Park Zoo. facebook.com/shophopseminoleheights.
Museum Store Sunday
Museum stores have the some of the coolest items. But they often get overlooked as a go-to spot for holiday shopping. So a global committee created an initiative to encourage people to shop at museum stores, which helps museums continue to bring us important exhibitions. Audrie Ranon, director of retail operations at the Museum of Fine Arts in St. Petersburg, was on that planning committee, so be sure to visit her at the museum store on Sunday (255 Beach Drive NE, mfastpete.org). Be sure to also check out the Tampa Museum of Art's store (120 W Gasparilla Plaza, tampamuseum.org), which is full of artful gifts for that creative person on your list.1989 VW Vanagon Syncro (4×4) Westfalia Auction – 236k Miles – Ashland, OR
It's been a while since I've posted about a Syncro, so here we go. This one must have been listed on eBay within the past day or so, as I didn't set it when I was looking yesterday morning. This van is a 1989 VW Vanagon Synrco (4x4) Westfalia camper and is currently up for auction on eBay and resides in Ashland, Oregon. The van features a 2.3L GoWesty engine with 1k miles, rebuilt German transaxle manual transmission, new tires, a $5k windows out paint job, power mirrors, power locks, power windows, Blaupunkt stereo, Altimeter and all kinds of other extras. They seller claims they've invested about $34k so far. Aside from the GoWesty engine, this Syncro Westy is pretty much stock. No mention of what kind of decoupler is installed, as this can be a big deal with these. Basically, there are various means of disengaging the 4x4 so you don't wear out the drive shaft and front wheels drive, and get better mileage. I'm going to reach out to the seller and see if they can provide any more details here. Also, is says 4 speed manual, when in fact, Syncros usually have 5 speeds, and they have a lower granny gear for crawling. eBay Auction Link (ends May 11th, 2014)

The species is part of the daisy family (Asteraceae) and flower heads are typically daisy-like and grow to 5 centimetres in diameter. The plant can grow to 1 metre tall and exhibits deeply lobed leaves that progressively decrease in size up the stem. Mature plants can produce up to 26,000 seeds, which are dispersed by animals, vehicles and water. Seeds are very long-lived, 80% are viable for six years and some up to 39 years.
Ox-eye daisy is a weed in over 40 countries and large infestations are present in the northern parts of North America, being found in every state of the U.S. The weed is not palatable to cattle and affects pastoral lands by reducing carrying capacity. Dense infestations exclude other plant species, leading to soil erosion and depletion of soil organic matter.. While most commonly observed in disturbed areas such as roadsides and cleared land, of most concern is the species aggressively invading undisturbed subalpine grasslands, snowgum woodlands and wetlands in Kosciuszko National Park.
A dense ox-eye daisy infestation in woodland at Tantangara
The National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) is undertaking a dual ox-eye daisy containment and asset protection program in Kosciuszko. Within the core infestation, six known populations of threatened flora are being protected, while simultaneously containing the infestation and preventing establishment in surrounding suitable habitat areas. These efforts have been accompanied by research to determine the mechanisms of invasion, extensive trialling of best practice management techniques, and investigation of methods to assist native flora to compete with ox-eye daisy.

That being said, I love everything food. I love meal planning, grocery shopping, making meals and desserts, and I especially love eating the results. Even more than actually eating them myself, I love cooking for my family and friends. I actually get a little bit of a "chef's high" from making an especially delicious creation and seeing my friends enjoy it. When they get that "look" of pure enjoyment, I get all happy inside. Yesterday, I made apple butter in my crock pot. The house smelled like what heaven must . . . all fragrant with cinnamon, cloves, and apples, simmering away. I then made fresh drop biscuits to spread the yummy goodness on. That tasted like pure heaven on a plate. One of my friends actually requested a "moment alone" with her treat.
I know most people have a preference of baking (cookies, brownies, bread, etc.) or cooking (more of the meal part, if you will) and if I had to choose, I would say that I ultimately prefer cooking. With baking, you have to be pretty precise or things do not turn out well. With cooking, you can be more creative. I rarely use a recipe after the first time making something. I get an idea of the basic recipe and then just wing it in the future. But you can be creative with baking, too, so long as you get the basic ingredients, most specifically any leavening agents, correctly measured, you can usually add and subtract other ingredients, too. See? I really love both. So it's a good thing that I don't have to choose!
I have learned most of my recipes from watching food shows, asking friends for their favorites, scouring through cookbooks, and reading through my latest addiction. . . food blogs! I love, love, love food blogs. I feel as if I have found "my people" when I go to a food blog. I don't like the heavily commercialized ones, but I do love the ones where an honest-to-goodness foodie is at the helm, putting their amazing recipes out for the world to see. We are a meat and potato, noodle and sauce family. Most of the recipes and sites that I am attracted to and make fall into that category.
My latest true love is this blog. This is where I got the recipes for both the apple butter and the drop biscuits. The drop biscuits were so easy to make. The apple butter was not difficult but it was very time consuming. Trust me when I tell you it so worth it. I can see it being an economical, fun gift to give out at the holidays to neighbors and friends.
What is your food style? Are you more of a baker or a cooker (is that even a word)? I asked for a recipe share a few weeks back, and got quite a few good ideas, but if you have more standbys, please feel free to leave one in the comment section. I am always on the prowl for a new favorite!

Hmm, I don't know. I LOVE food of all kinds. I think I'd say that I lean towards baking though.
I can't find the recipe for the apple butter or drop biscuits on that blog??? Will you please post the link to the recipe?

More about Kecksburg
He, with Robert Young, gives as much documentation and informed comment as any ufologist could possibly want. In his introduction he writes:
The Kecksburg case stands as one of those UFO cases that never should have been one. If it weren't for the exaggerated claims of of a few dubious individuals and the efforts of several UFO promoters, the case would have remained in the dust bin of "old solved mysteries". However, when it comes to making something out of nothing, UFOlogists are experts.
While reading the materials and eyewitness testimonies, I found it most interesting that all sorts of people claim to have been present but there is little evidence to confirm they were there. Some of these witnesses came from tens of miles away and had no idea where to go to find the crash site. They then managed to get past all the local crowds and sneak into areas that were supposedly well guarded. Others were able to see underneath the tarp covering the "object" and, despite the flatbed driving rapidly by, were able to see distinctive writing. I wish my eyesight was this good in the dark. A lot of these stories just don't sound realistic to me but, to a UFO crashologist, they are golden nuggets to be presented as factual.

UFOs and nukes
However, those who are impressed by the details published by Hastings, and others, about the amazing UFO interference with this missile test have possibly not read the detailed rebuttal of this story by Kingston George, who ought to know rather more than most people about this matter, having been the project engineer. His version is available HERE on the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry web site.
The point I wish to make here is that you must choose between believing either that the saucers are constantly interfering with the nuclear deterrent capability of the USA, and other nations, or that it is all a lot of nonsense. If you believe the assertions of Hastings and friends then you must realise that you also must believe that nuclear weapons systems are quite useless, as the activities of the UFOs make them totally unpredictable. Will the space people allow them to be launched or not if a nuclear conflict seems inevitable?

Unreal UFOs
Although there were five witnesses, they were all together in a boat and they all knew one another. There were no independent witnesses. Thus they obviously compared their impressions before talking to investigators. For example, in this case they apparently agreed that the object was at a height of 5,000 feet. I think it is generally agreed that witnesses can influence one another so that the version given to investigators tends to be that of the person with the most forceful personality in the group. However, there is another possibility, which is that in some such cases the witnesses might have been "seeing" something which did not exist. I must make it clear that I am not suggesting that this happened in the Rogue River case, or any particular case, but I am sure many of you can think of a number of cases where this might usefully be considered.
Many years ago the psychiatrist,C.G. Jung raised this matter in his book Flying Saucers: A modern myth of things seen in the skies. I quote from the English translation by R.F.C. Hull (London, Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1959).
Apart from collective visions, there are on record cases where one or more persons see something that physically is not there. For instance, I was once at a spirtualistic séance where four of the five people present saw an object like a moon floating above the abdomen of the medium. They showed me, the fifth person present, exactly where it was, and it was absolutely incomprehensible to them that I could see nothing of the sort. I know of three more cases where certain objects were seen in the clearest detail (in two of them by two persons, and in the third by one person) and could afterwards be proved to be non-existent. Two of these cases happened under my direct observation. Even people who are entirely compos mentis and in full possession of their senses can sometimes see things that do not exist. I do not know what the explanation is of such happenings. It is very possible that they are less rare than I am inclined to suppose. For as a rule we do not verify things we have "seen with our own eyes", and so we never get to know that actually they did not exist. I mention these somewhat remote possibilities because, in such an unusual matter as the Ufos, one has to take every aspect into account.
How does one decide which UFO sightings are of real objects and which ones are of unreal objects? Perhaps if there were other potential witnesses nearby at the time who saw nothing unusual that would indicate a UFO that had no objective existence, but if there was independent confirmation then the sighting would have to be taken more seriously. How many interesting UFO reports pass this test? Any serious suggestions welcome.

Moon rock and meteorite
One evening, he called to see me at the house where I lived at the time with my parents and my brother, and proudly announced that he had a piece of moon rock to show us. He produced a small tobacco tin stuffed with cotton wool. In the middle of this was a tiny grain of moon rock, which we gazed at respectfully as we passed it around. Finally it was handed to my father. "I can't see anything", he said.
Panic! Where was it? Frantic searching ensued, but of course it was not found as, after all, it looked no different from any other piece of grit unless subjected to expert examination under a microscope. Nevertheless, Sharp called round the next day and asked my mother for the vacuum cleaner, which he applied to our entire living room, including our cat, and desperately sifted through the contents of the dust bag, with negative results, of course.
He was greatly distressed by this incident, even though no NASA officials or American cops tried to arrest him. When we told others about this, though, it resulted in a great deal of what Americans call knee slapping and falling about.
There was another episode that I recall involving Alan Sharp and (alleged) extraterrestrial material. At about the time of the moon rock incident, or perhaps a little later (it was a long time ago, and I can't remember the details, as I'm getting on a bit) Sharp was appointed to the post of mathematics master at St Anselm's College, Birkenhead, a local grammar school which I had attended in the 1950s. I told Sharp that there used to be what was said to be a meteorite in the centre of the quadrangle. It certainly looked like a meteorite, when compared with photographs in astronomy books and meteorites in museums, and I would estimate its size as about 25 cm (10 inches) long. No information about its provenance was available, just rumours that it had been found somewhere locally or had been dug up when the school's foundations had been laid. It disappeared during the building of the school hall and was never heard of again.
Alan Sharp eagerly questioned the physics master who had been there when I was a pupil, and was still teaching there, but he denied all knowledge of it, as did everyone else he questioned. This was, of course, a mystery in itself. If anyone out there knows anything about this mysterious object, perhaps they will let me know.

The continuing Roswell obsession
I remember once hearing Mark Pilkington giving his impression of American ufology as: "Roswell, Roswell, Roswell, Roswell . . ." How true, I thought, how very true. And I still think so; there is no escape. Here are two examples of American ufology's continuing Roswell obsession.
Kevin Randle has a posting on his blog A Different Perspective, October 31, titled "Roswell Investigation Dream Team". You will note that this team consists of Kevin Randle, Tom Carey and Don Schmitt. If you don't know why I consider these people to be an unlikely trio to discover the Utimate Truth about Roswell, then see my review of Carey and Schmitt's book Witness to Roswell and the article about Randle and Schmitt in The Roswell Files website.
There are comments about "The Dream Team" in the 1 November posting in The UFO Iconoclast(s) blog,
which also includes amazing news of Anthony Bragalia having discovered "some revelatory and truly significant material" which is "not trivial and opens cans of worms . . . "
Two predictions from me:
- "The Dream Team" will not produce any significant results.
- Bragalia's discovery is not significant and will not open any metaphorical cans of worms.Join our email list for exclusive savings and new product information.

The Kamloops, B.C., mother hasn't seen her daughter, Jessica "Jessie" Foster, since Christmas 2005, when the then-21-year-old came home for the holidays.
Jessie had been living in Las Vegas and told her mom she had become engaged to be married.
"We thought Jessie was living a normal life in Las Vegas, but ultimately, that's not what was going on at all," Grant told CTV's Canada AM Monday from Vancouver.
"We spoke to people who knew Jessie down there and they told me she was actually afraid of this person [her fiancé]."
Grant would later learn that Jessie had been living with 39-year-old Peter Todd, who was well-known to police as a pimp. What Grant.
Though police began an investigation into the Calgary woman's disappearance, no trace of Jessie has even been found.
What is worrying about Jessie's case is that at the same time she disappeared, so did three other young women, in similar circumstances. The other three were all eventually found dead.
But Grant doesn't believe her daughter is dead. After learning more about Jessie's life in Las Vegas through the work of a private investigator, Grant now has a theory about what happened to her.
"Jessie was actually a human trafficking victim. And she had fallen victim to these people," she says.
"And when she tried to leave, they just took her away somewhere."
They depict Jessie as she might look at age 26. In one of the images, Trepkov drew Jessie as she would look if her appearance had been altered by her captors, in order to disguise her. Her blond hair is darkened and her skin is tanned, here hair is shown straight and short on one side, and long and wavy on the other.
The second image shows how Trepkov thinks Jessie might look if she was being physically abused by human traffickers.
"I made her look very tired, thinned, worn out, a bruise on the lip, dark circles under her eyes. I disguised her with darker hair in a split hairstyle," Trepkov told Canada AM.
"Human trafficking is a $1 billion industry. She would be prime, because she's blond and petite. They would kidnap her and make her look different."
Grant hopes someone will see the sketches and recognize Jessie and help find her daughter.
Grant firmly believes Jessie is still alive somewhere because she says she can feel it in her heart.
"I've talked to the mothers of those other women who were found deceased and one of them in particular told me that she knew even before her daughter's remains were identified that she didn't think her daughter would ever be found alive. She said this came from deep in her heart. We call this our heartstrings. My heartstrings are still connected to Jessie. It hasn't changed in terms of me feeling that she's still alive," Grant said.
"A mother knows in her heart when her child has died, and I haven't felt that at all. And that gives me the greatest hope."
Anyone who thinks they have information about the disappearance of Jessie Foster is asked to call Crimestoppers at 1-800-222-TIPS.

For the 281,000 residents who have non-group insurance, reform will allow them to get affordable coverage through the health insurance exchange.
These numbers and more are provided on the Department of Health and Human Services website that shows how many people in each state will benefit from health care reform.
The site provides information specific to Arizona.
Under reform in Arizona:
- 1.3 million residents who do not currently have insurance and 281,000 residents who have non-group insurance could get affordable coverage through the health insurance exchange.
- 746,000 residents could qualify for premium tax credits to help them purchase health coverage.
- 853,000 seniors can receive free preventive services. (Begins in 2010.)
- 151,000 seniors will have their brand-name drug costs in the Medicare Part D “doughnut hole” halved. (2011)
- 63,700 small businesses could be helped by a small business tax credit to make premiums more affordable. (2010)
Proposals implemented in 2010 and 2011 will produce real benefits for:
- FAMILIES: The 6.5 million residents of Arizona will benefit as reform:
- Ensures consumer protections in the insurance market. Insurance companies will no longer be able to place lifetime limits on the coverage they provide, use of annual limits will be restricted, and they will not be able to arbitrarily drop coverage.
- Creates immediate options for people who can’t get insurance today. 8 percent of people in Arizona have diabetes, and 25 percent have high blood pressure – two conditions that insurance companies could use as a reason to deny health insurance coverage. Reform will establish a high-risk pool to enable people who cannot get insurance today to find an affordable health plan.
- Ensures free preventive services. 36 percent of Arizona residents have not had a colorectal cancer screening, and 19 percent of women over 50 have not had a mammogram in the past two years. Health insurance reform will ensure that people can access preventive services for free through their health plans. It will also invest in a prevention and public health fund to encourage prevention and wellness programs.
- Supports health coverage for early retirees. An estimated 111,000 people from Arizona have early retiree coverage through their former employers, but early retiree coverage has eroded over time. A reinsurance program will stabilize early retiree coverage and provide premium relief to both early retirees and the workers in the firms that provide their health benefits. This could save families up to $1,200 on premiums. (Begins in 2010.)
- SENIORS: Arizona’s 853,000 Medicare beneficiaries will benefit as reform:
- Lowers premiums by reducing Medicare’s over-payments to private plans. All Medicare beneficiaries pay the price of excessive over-payments through higher premiums – even the 68 percent of seniors in Arizona who are not enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan. A typical couple in traditional Medicare will pay nearly $90 in additional Medicare premiums next year to subsidize these private plans. Health insurance reform clamps down on these excessive payments.
There are a couple of falacies implied by the proponents of this so called “reform” bill.
1. It will lower costs by putting more people into the “pool”. It does so by using tax subsidies. Who supplies those subsidies? You and me through our tax payments.
2. It will require Medicare Advantage plans to have an out-of-pocket maximum. guess what———–Secure Horizons already has that. And also provides help toward vision and hearing benefits. And the premium is zero beyond what you already pay for Part B.
3. Perscription drug coverage is an additional premium for those with medicare suppliments. Usually about $35 per month. It will go up as the “donut hole” shrinks.
BGTW drug coverage is included in most Medicare Advantage plans with no added premium— see Secure Horizons.
4. It’s going to be “free”. Right. and the tooth fairy leaves money under your pillow.
The way to lower the costs of any group program, Medicare included, is to have a risk pool which is (1)large enough and (2) includes a large group of people who are at lower risk of costing the system money. By reducing the age for entry into medicare, you will increase the risk pool with people who will cost the system less because they have fewer medical problems – even as they pay their premiums, which means there is more money coming in, less money going out. In my opinion, the most important thing is prevention. Anything that prevents a person from developing a medical problem or worsening one that already exists will greatly improve the finances of the system. Prevention will also give us a healthier country – and that would be a great thing!!!!
The underlying question too Mr. Creelman’s post is are we a community? I know, more than 300 million people is hard to consider a community – but it is. I believe in government. I believe that my taxes are the dues I pay to live in a democracy. Further, I believe that all religions bid us to be our brother’s and sister’s keeper – government is the entity that orchestrates the response to that commandment. And last, but not least, I believe it is my responsibility to be as knowledgeable as possible about the issues of the day – and the next day, too – and to participate being politically active and that means voting!
Seure Horizon Plan 1 – the largest Secure Horizon plan – does not have a cap. Plan 3 does. Health Net has a cap. Humana has a cap. CareMore does not have a cap.
Medicare Advantage premiums are zero because Medicare is paying $800 per month (or more) to Secure Horizons for each person enrolled in their plans. This allows SH and other MA plans to make excellent profits from the MA plans, but MA plans are costing Medicare too much money. MA plans were created to save money for Medicare, but those financially conservative Republicans decided to change the payment formula and enrich insurance companies.
If you have health insurance through your employer your employer is getting a tax subsidy for you- so this idea is pretty mainstream.
How will HCR affect Medicare Part D? Perspective at
The health care reform bill will help people who fall into the doughnut hole in their Part D plan. In 2010, a person who hits the doughnut hole will get a check for $250 from Social Security. In 2011, the threshold for going into the doughnut hole will be raised by $500 and drug costs will be discounted 50% for the person in the doughnut hole.
This will be a big break for someone whose monthly drug costs might be $500. The cost will be cut in half to $250who must pay the total cost of their drugs. Over several years, the threshold for hitting the doughnut hole will be raised so that, eventually, there will be no gap in coverage for people with high prescription drug costs.
Who will it benefit? Those that make about 35K (Family) and will enjoy having their health insurance paid for. If you make more than 88K…you’re out of luck. However, in 2014, you can purchase major medical health insurance OUTSIDE of the exchanges and perhaps get a very affordable rate.
We’ll see.Tuesday, October 18, 2011
NaNoWriMo
November is closing in fast, bringing about the annual, insanity-fueled writing event that is National Novel Writing Month. As I’ve mentioned in earlier posts, National Novel Writing Month (or NaNo) was an event I only participated in as a spectator until last year, when I finally screwed up the courage and joined in and “won.”
People tend to either love or hate NaNo - and it isn’t for everyone - but I credit this annual call to unfettered writing for getting me back on the road to becoming an author. It helped me break through a wall that I thought insurmountable, and I now have a complete first draft of a novel.
But, should I participate again this year?
My first draft of my novel is a bit of a mess. According to my handy (and carefully crafted) writing schedule, I should be done with my rewrite by now, thus freeing me up to participate in this year’s mad month of novel writing. I’m not finished - not even close.
Then there is the issue that the first draft IS such a mess, which prompted my decision for a full rewrite. Is that because I wrote it in the frenzy of NaNo? Or, is it because it was the first writing of length that I had attempted in over ten years? Is a badly written first draft better than no draft - especially in light of the fact that I have still failed to rewrite my first NaNo progeny? Will I ever finish my first novel if I start a second? Will the world really end in 2012?
Look people, I’m going to go ahead and confess that I’ve decided to go forward with this year’s test to writing sanity. I’ve reactivated my account at the NaNo site - I’m in. Is it a good idea? Who knows? I’m still having the above debate in my head. But, what I do know is this: I need a fix. I’ve been floundering the last two months, and I need the rush that only a hit of success can bring. I NEEDS it.
Until November, I’m going to work as hard as I can on my rewrite - try to at least get the beginning finished. Maybe I’ll even continue to work on it, perhaps a chapter a week, during NaNo. It could happen. NaNo could get my adrenaline going, and I could become a word machine. After all, it happened once before. I finished NaNo last year with just over 56,000 words. It was magic, and right now, I need some magic.
Anyone else joining in NaNoWriMo this year? Do you plan to work on another project at the same time (or is that just certifiable?)

I'm still in consideration mode. The problem is, I think I had a potential idea, but I can't remember what it was. NaNo maybe, with a slight lean toward yes.
If I do jump into the NaNo pool, I will almost certainly be working on revisions/work on my WiP at the same time. I'm not sure how that's going to work, but I've certainly read of a lot of writers who work on a new piece for part of the day, and then work on edits/rewrites/revisions on something else for the other part of their writing time.
We're going to have to be awfully disciplined to pull off NaNo AND edits/rewrites/revisions. But, NaNo is supposed to be about challenging oneself, right?Admission Coupon | Battles | Brochure | Book Signing | Canadian Firearms Regulations and Re-enactors | Contact Info | Entertainment | Event Pictures | History H.M.S.

This is a policy truly in development. Thus this page includes many aspects of reasoning and discussion which may later be removed for conciseness.
This "policy" will be renamed, if necessary, as appropriate when the current debate resolves. It may well be renamed to something like "Inclusion and Classification of Old Words". Until then it will remain at this "page address".
Policy for Inclusion of old wordsEdit
- obsolete and archaic and unfashionable/dated terms and meanings are to be included in Wiktionary.
People reading texts from an earlier era should be able to refer to Wiktionary to find the meaning of words in that text, even those no longer in use. This guideline applies whether the term is peculiar to the court of Queen Elizabeth I, or to the punk scene of the 1980s.
Note: Such terms are still subject to WT:CFI, so it does not justify including a word that was only used by a very small group and only published in a single publication of limited readership.
Classifications of old wordsEdit
The following tags are not intended to dictate whether or how to use the tagged entries, but to inform the reader of the modern rarity and possible connotations within modern contexts.
Old EnglishEdit
Old English words (ISO 639-3 language code ang, “Anglo Saxon Englisc”), used before AD 1100, are so differently spelt from current spelling, or completely different in meaning, as to be virtually a foreign language to modern English speakers. Entries for such terms are treated as foreign words with the L2 language heading ==Old English==, categorized within Category:Old English language, and defined with a modern English translation. No “(archaic)”, “(obsolete)”, or “(dated)” tags are used.
Middle EnglishEdit
Middle English words (ISO 639-3 language code enm), used between circa AD 1100 and circa AD 1470, are also regarded as words from a foreign language. Entries for such terms are given an L2 language header of ==Middle English==, classified within Category:Middle English language, and defined with a modern English translation. No “(archaic)”, “(obsolete)”, or “(dated)” tags are used.
ObsoleteEdit
No longer in use; found only in very old texts. Can also apply to a no longer understood definition of a word. Examples: zyxt, "to pay" definition of yield
- Virtually no one would currently use the word or meaning, and very, very few would understand the word or meaning if it were used in speech or text.
ArchaicEdit
No longer in general use, but still found in some contemporary texts (e.g. the Bible). Examples: thou (singular second-person subject; "you"), œconomy.
- Generally understood by educated people, but rarely used in current texts or speech.
Unfashionable/DatedEdit
Still in use, but generally only by older people, and considered unfashionable or superseded, particularly by younger people. Examples: wireless (in sense "broadcast radio tuner"), groovy, gramophone, gay (in the senses of "bright", "happy" etc.)
Please keep in mind that what may be considered "unfashionable" or "dated" in one region may not be in another, so where possible please include regional information. If in doubt, make a Usage Note stating that the term may be considered unfashionable or dated in some areas. (See also WT:NPOV.)
Tagging words and meanings with “Archaic” or “Obsolete” or “Dated”Edit
To tag definitions in entries:
{{lb|xx|obsolete}}tags and categorises as (obsolete)
{{lb|xx|archaic}}tags and categorises as (archaic)
{{lb|xx|dated}}tags and categorises as (dated)
Where xx is the relevant language code. As well as tagging words or meaning with “archaic”, “obsolete” or “dated”, it would be helpful to indicate the era in which the word fell into this classification of usage. eg: (archaic) - Shakespearean era-1920s, (dated) - 1960s, (unfashionable) - 1990s.
To tag things that aren't definitions, such as links to other entries, use
{{q}} instead and omit the language code.
ReferencesEdit
- see the definitions in archaic and obsolete and Old English
- see the category definitions in category:Archaic, category:Obsolete
This policy and the category definitions should be aligned at least. And hopefully aligned with common dictionary usage of the terms "archaic" and "obsolete", to be reflected in the entries archaic and obsolete.
- as a dynamic new technology dictionary we will need to "invent" a meaning for "unfashionable" (or dated) that meets our needs. Previous technology dictionaries were less able to classify this kind of word, and thus may not have had a precise word/meaning to use for our purposes.Review: Nixeus Earphones
Nixeus, a California based company, has a vast portfolio of new tech products hitting the market. They make a gaming mechanical keyboard, computer monitors, cables, and headphones. Although the product offering in each category is limited, there is a rather refreshing philosophy behind their products. These products are for the average consumer, like you and I. This means reasonable pricing without sacrificing quality in sound and durability. Value does not mean cheap, and the Nixeus Earphones have just taken that statement to the next level.
Price, price, price…
I really cannot stress this enough. With a $40 MSRP (and a lower price at Amazon), this puts the headset in contention with value headphones from Sony, JVC, and Skullcandy. Although these brands are highly recognizable, that does not guarantee quality. Nixeus is making a statement by offering one of the very few headphones on the market with a limited lifetime warranty. Yes you read that right. Limited lifetime warranty with a very low sale price. I put these up against the Turtle Beach M1s and the Nixeus headphones were so much better it was shocking. I wondered how a brand like Turtle Beach, with all their resources, were outgunned in a mobile headset from a relative newcomer to the industry. Add in the lifetime warranty, carrying case, and price and you can see what I was questioning what is right in the world.
Bells and Whistles
The earphones come with a few goodies inside. You get a carrying case, 3 different size cups for your ear, and a microphone/headphone splitter for PC compatibility. The cord is fairly short so don’t expect to plug this into a desktop on the floor. The length (1.2 meters) is perfect for phones, tablets, and laptops however. The 13mm Neodymium drivers provide excellent bass response with higher power handling than most earphones in this price range. The left earphone features volume control with a microphone and push-to-talk button. Overall the sound quality is excellent, and would be almost perfect with slightly brighter highs. They stayed comfortable in my ears for extended use and have a stylish silver finish.
Closing Thoughts
I wanted to just write, “Buy Them” but I feel like we owe your more than that. In all seriousness though, these earphones are an excellent value. Sony has always provided great sound quality for cheap headphones so I was apprehensive about a new brand offering ones around the same price. The build quality and power handling on the Nixeus Earphones are excellent. Sony does not give you a carrying case, PC adapter, or lifetime warranty so for a comparable price I suggest picking these up for yourself. If you want more proof, look at the comments on Amazon. Customers love them and I’m going to join in and say I love them too.

Internet Trends PresentationIf we look at the cost of future technologies, it will be hard for the smaller foundries to continue on their own. See earlier blogs; TSMC: Single-Customer (Apple? Qualcomm?) Fabs Make Sense , the cost issues were discussed in several earlier blogs starting in the March blog Moore's Law End? (Next semiconductors gen. cost $10 billion)
The article below also mentions that "the combined sales of the four Japanese companies in the top 20 ranking (Toshiba, Renesas, Sony, and Fujitsu) dropped 16% in 2Q12 as compared to 1Q12". Additional signs of Japanese fabs deteriorating position is the March blog Are Japan's Fabs stuck above 28nm Process Technology?.

Foundries Soar While Most Japanese Companies Crash in 2Q12 Ranking
GlobalFoundries jumps five spots and now ranks 16th in the first half 2012 ranking.
August 02, 2012 -- A ranking of the 1H12 top semiconductor suppliers will be included as part of IC Insights' upcoming August Update to The McClean Report. As shown in Figure 1, there are three pure-play foundries in the top 20 ranking. In total, these foundries logged a 20% increase in 2Q12/1Q12 sales. In fact, TSMC’s capacity utilization rate in 2Q12 was 102% (exceeding 100% because of the way the company defines its utilization rate)..
Figure 1
GlobalFoundries’ 2Q12 sales jumped by 18%, which helped move the company past UMC to become the second-largest foundry in the world. Currently, GlobalFoundries is ranked as the 16th largest semiconductor supplier worldwide and IC Insights believes the company has a good chance of surpassing Fujitsu in full-year 2012 sales to move into 15th place.
In contrast to the excellent performance of the foundries, the combined sales of the four Japanese companies in the top 20 ranking (Toshiba, Renesas, Sony, and Fujitsu) dropped 16% in 2Q12 as compared to 1Q12, with Sony being the only Japanese company to register quarterly growth. However, things may not be as bad as they appear for some of the Japanese companies as Renesas is currently expecting a 3Q12/2Q12 semiconductor sales increase of 24% and Toshiba has not yet changed its relatively aggressive full-year fiscal 2013 (ending March of 2013) guidance, which suggests it may be expecting a strong rebound in sales later this year.
Ninth-ranked Micron is now set to acquire bankrupt Elpida, another struggling Japanese company that is currently ranked 24th in the world. If this occurs, Micron would likely add between $2.5 and $3.0 billion in revenue to its annual sales, which could move the company up one or two positions in the ranking. This acquisition would also end Japanese company involvement in the DRAM market, a market they once dominated in the 1980s and 1990s.
Figure 2 illustrates that there was a wide range of 2Q12/1Q12 growth rates among the top 20 semiconductor suppliers. In total, the top 20 semiconductor suppliers showed a 3% increase in 2Q12 sales as compared to 1Q12. This figure is three points less than the total 2Q12 worldwide semiconductor industry growth rate of 6%. In fact, when excluding the top three foundries—TSMC, GlobalFoundries, and UMC, the combined sales of the remaining 17 companies in the top-20 ranking logged a sales increase of only 1% in 2Q12.
Figure 2As shown, Toshiba ranked as the worst performing top-20 company in 2Q12, registering a steep 26% 2Q12/1Q12 sales decline. This drop was due almost entirely to the poor performance of its memory segment (primarily NAND flash), which saw a dramatic 40% 2Q12/1Q12 sales collapse (a decline of about $800 million). As has been recently reported, the company plans to cut its NAND flash production by 30% in response to this situation. In contrast to its memory sales, Toshiba’s 2Q12/1Q12 logic IC sales were down only 9% and its O-S-D (optoelectronics, sensors, and discretes) sales were flat. It is interesting to note that SanDisk, Toshiba’s NAND flash memory partner, encountered a much more moderate 2Q12/1Q12 sales decline of 14%.
After reviewing the top 20 companies’ 3Q12 outlooks, it appears that the top 20 semiconductor suppliers, in total, are likely to show a 5% increase in sales in 3Q12 as compared with 2Q12. While this level of growth is not very exciting, it is only one point below the past 30-year average third quarter total semiconductor market increase of 6%.
Several major product introductions are set to occur in 4Q12 that could potentially bring additional momentum to the semiconductor market at the end of this year. The release of Apple’s newest version of its iPhone (iPhone 5) is expected no later than October. Moreover, Microsoft’s Windows 8 operating system is the first major upgrade to its OS in several years and is scheduled to be released in 4Q12. Also, Intel reports that numerous new ultra-thin but powerful Ultrabook computers will debut in 4Q12, some priced as low as $699. In total, IC Insights expects a 4Q12/3Q12 semiconductor sales increase of 2% and a full-year 2012 semiconductor market increase of 3%.OPM: Stepping into the world of Wasteland in the overly large shoes of the eponymouse himself is a lot like entering the gates of the Magic Kingdom.

Wow! That is some gap between the posts!<br /><br />To begin with, here's wishing the all of you a very happy new year. May this New Year bring in your lives all the love and luck that you wish for.<br /><br />Now moving on to as to where i had disappeared for so long.. To begin with, the year 2010 ended on a very sweet note for me.. We were blessed with a beautiful daughter on the 26th of October. :) As expected, things post that have been pretty hectic. Well no, hectic is surely one understatement! With a baby at home, the requirement to be around it is 24x7. Taking a break from work was a conscious decision for me.<br /><br />So now after 3 months and after finally getting into some sort of a routine and help at home I am attempting to get back to my assignments and work all over again. The process would be slow but yes, steady and regular. I now expect myself to get back to my routine with my blog too and update it regularly with blog entries.<br /><br />So let us now get back to our writing passion and wish that this new year has some awesome and interesting writing assignments in line for us to talk about and discuss here!<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>Niha Redhu Name vs Business Name<div style="text-align: justify;"><br />I have been thinking on this topic for a while now. I freelance under my personal name and have a website too for it. But I have personally come across many people who freelance under a business name. So which choice seems apt? I think it is more of a personal decision and depends on what you perceive your business to be.<br /><br />Let us take it up one by one. I chose to work under my<span style="font-weight: bold;"> personal name</span> because since I was starting out as a fresher I wanted to concentrate more on acquiring clients rather than entangling myself in the intricacies involved in branding a start up. Also, to be frank, I wanted to initially test the waters and see as to if I can establish myself successfully in this field. Apart from this, I feel there are several other factors too which can make the choice of using your personal name as your brand name a better option.<br /><br /> To start with, it allows you to convey a sense of personal involvement to your client. In a way it provides to the client a belief that the work delivered by you will bear your personal stamp and signify your true capabilities. But all this does not take away the disadvantages that are associated with using your personal name. To some clients, the use of your personal name as your business name might make it sound too casual and non professional. Also, it might get a bit difficult for you if you wish to sell the USP of your business by using your personal name. Pronouncing your name and remembering the same for future references too might be an issue for some clients living in other countries.<br /><br />So does that make a <span style="font-weight: bold;">business name</span> a better option? Well, I see some disadvantages here too. Not only is the job of branding your business expensive but at the same time it needs to capture the true essence of your business too. The process of registering your business name to is a bit lengthy and involves a lot of paper work. What is also important is the fact that with a business name once in place it would get difficult for you to re invent or start something new under the same brand name. This is because the existing business name might not capture the true feel of the new business that you want to start.<br /><br />So what should one do? I say go with your heart! If you are starting out afresh it is a sensible thought to start with your personal name. Once you see your business grooming according to your expectations you can then switch over to acquire a more professional sounding business name.<br /><br /><br /></div>Niha Redhu Articles That Can Earn Their Worth<div style="text-align: justify;"><br />Many a times have I got assignments which have required me to write SEO optimized articles. The clients have sent the keywords that they wish me to work around and incorporate in the article. The basic aim of these SEO articles is to allow the client to get a favorable rank for a particular keyword on major search engines. This in turn would help them get more traffic to their website who seek information regarding that particular keyword.<br /><br />So how does one approach with the task of writing for these SEO articles and most importantly make them successful towards delivering the desired result. Each one of us might be having their own approach here. I would like to share as to how I go about when presented with this task.<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">1. Research</span><br />I enter the primary keyword provided to me by the client in Google and see the kind of results that come my way. I read the top listings from the results and try to get an idea on what kind of content is generally posted. This also allows me to analyze what is NOT present already and therefore gives me some points to work on. Further, it also allows me to analyze the kind of content people like to read on that particular keyword.<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">2. Secondary Keywords</span><br />Even if the client may have provided me with 1 primary keyword I try to look around for some secondary keywords too. These secondary keywords provide the article with certainty and reliability that search engines generally look for when indexing an article. This strategy would also help rope in more visitors to your article as all readers might not use just the primary keyword for their searches. If there are sufficient related words in your article then the reading audience would increase.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">3. Positioning Keywords</span><br />When starting to write the content, it is very important to know as to where you should insert the primary keywords so as to get the maximum SEO value from them. Ideally, your primary keywords should certainly figure in<br />• The title<br />• The Meta Tag<br />• The first 2 lines of the first paragraph<br />• In all the heading and sub headings<br />• Evenly dispersed throughout the content<br />• In the anchor text for the links made in the article<br /><br />It is always a good idea to provide your client with something extra.

He was in the process of drafting an article for a UK based magazine and had to stick to their style of writing. Though I consider myself as no expert here but whatever information and knowledge I had on it I shared it with him. This made me realise that why not share the same information here too. I am sure that there are many people out there with the same issue at hand. It becomes all the more important when we have to decide which one of these to use for drafting content of our websites. <br /><br />When trying to differentiate the British English from the American English, there are a few aspects where they differ. Let us start with the <span style="font-weight: bold;">spellings</span>.<br /><br />Most of us are aware that there are certain words which the American and the British spell differently.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">British English ; American English </span><br />centre ; center<br />theatre ; theater<br />colour ; color<br />catalogue ; catalog<br />programme ; program<br />neighbour ; neighbor<br /><br />The next point differentiating them would be the <span style="font-weight: bold;">vocabulary</span>. There are some words and terms that are either used only in British or American English.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">British English ; American English </span><br />lift ; elevator<br />boot ; trunk<br />autumn ; fall<br />litter ; garbage<br />crossroad ; crossing<br />trousers ; pants<br /><br />Then we have <span style="font-weight: bold;">plurals</span>. There are a number of nouns that don’t have a plural form in British English while they do have a plural form in American English.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">British English </span> ; <span style="font-weight: bold;"> American English</span><br />types of accommodation ; accommodation<br />types of food ; foods<br />a lot of fruit ; many foods<br />strands of hair ; hairs<br /><br />The next big difference which creeps is the way that the British use their <span style="font-weight: bold;">grammar</span>. It includes how they use their “present perfects” and “adverbs” in their sentence formations.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">So which version of these two languages should one use on their website</span>?<br /><br /><ul><li>If you wish your website to cater to a local population then the best way ahead would be to use the English language variant used there. This will make the readers there to accept your style of writing much easily.<br /></li><li>This means that if you have a US based website then you should use American English and likewise for a UK based website the best pick would be British English. </li></ul><br /><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">But what do you do if you wish your website to be viewed as a website catering to the international clientele? </span><br /><br />The solution for this would depend on your main target audience. If your prospective clients are primarily from Europe then the website content should be written in British English. On the other hand if you wish to target the American and Asian community, then the preferred pick would be American English.<br /><br />Whatever be your pick regarding the variant of the English language the <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">golden rule to follow is to stick to any one form of the language and stick to it while drafting the content of the entire website. </span><br /><br /><br /></div>Niha Redhu And A Little Bit More....<div style="text-align: justify;">Aloha! It is again the time of the year for self review of my work, and to seek control over my TO DO list which I fear has now garnered more items than what I was hoping to see there!<br /><br /> After quite some deliberation I have decided to add my pricing in INR too on my website. I had till now mentioned my content writing prices only in USD. This was because 90% of the assignments which came my way were from clients abroad. I would respond to any price queries sent by Indians wanting to know about the same in INR via emails. But lately these kind of enquires became a little too many therefore frankly speaking, in order to lessen my burden I am putting up my price list in INR too.<br /><br />Also up for some fresh lease of life is the portfolio section on my website. This work has been lurking on the list for quite some time now. I need to add some of my latest work there and sort out some of the older websites that are there in the list.<br /><br />This reminds me that I also need to update the blog too with my new projects. My my, I really need to take control on this list now. The only question is WHEN??????<br /><br />Ok, so let me do a small bit and write something about my latest project. This one is different. Yes, I know I say the same for all my projects!! But what to do, this too is different and that too in two perspectives. 1. I am doing it for a friend and 2. It is a website dedicated for pets, something which again is new for me.<br /><br />The website is still in its building stages and so is its final name. It is supposed to be a one stop solution to take care of all your needs regarding your pets. It includes information on their diet, their style trends, their health and other aspects. It also prospects to have a section on their day care support near to your place, a DIY section for projects that you can do for your pets as well as other small nuggets of information related to your pets. Something new for sure but yes, interesting too! One thing would have surely helped, It would have been easier had I been a pet lover! :)<br /><br /></div>Niha Redhu Cards - Ayes or Noes?<div style="text-align: justify;"><br /><br />For quite some time now I have been contemplating on the idea of having business cards designed for myself. The point which has kept me off till now is to decide whether I <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">want it</span> or I <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">need it</span>.<br /><br />As a freelancer web content writer a big chunk of my business came online via referrals. This in a way negated any need of having a business card for my line of work. Therefore it was the “<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">want</span>” which was the over powering emotion here. The justification of the “<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">need</span>” came with some careful analysis.<br /><br />I realized that a business card is the <span style="font-weight: bold;">perfect brand identity</span> that my freelance work could need. It would sum up my work and details on a small piece of paper what I would otherwise have to spend 2 minutes describing. In a world where business is driven by contacts, my business card would be the perfect leave-behind-imprint for my freelancing work.<br /><br />In my line of work I have seen that good work can come from <span style="font-weight: bold;">unexpected avenues</span> too. So you never know that the person standing ahead of you in a queue on the coffee shop might be on the lookout for a writer himself. A business card given to him then and there might just land you your next project!<br /><br />Since most of my work come as referrals from my old clients I feel that it is a good idea if I would go ahead and leave some business card with my clients who can then on inquiry from others regarding my work pass on my card to them. A pretty neat way of <span style="font-weight: bold;">getting referrals</span> huh!<br /><br />Ok. So the business cards are final then. The next task would be to look around for designs and ideas for the same. Seems like a long way ahead here.. !!<br /><br /><br /></div>Niha Redhu Currency Fluctuations Work Your Way<div style="text-align: justify;">It has been really long since I sat down and wrote a blog post. Well it was a combination of laziness and the absence of any good issue which really motivated me to write and entry. Well today, I got rid of the former and had a good latter which made me sit down and write. Group effort I say!<br /><br />It makes me wonder as to how many new roles have I started to play since I went out working as a freelance writer. It has made me my own personal organizer, a creative thinker and at the same time a financial analyst. The first two can be related but what about the third? Well, this is where the fluctuating economic conditions come into play! No, I have not started writing articles on the global financial economy but I am gravely affected by the fluctuating currency denominations when it comes to asking for payments for my projects.<br /><br /> When I started out I did not bother much about it and was OK with the rate I got after the currency conversion rates. But lately with experience (and maybe the greed to get some more!) this has become a very important point for me when I quote rates for my projects. There are two currency related factors that I need to keep in mind before I go ahead and quote my price; the current currency conversion rate and, since I use PayPal for my payments therefore the fee that PayPal deducts for the payments.<br /><br />Apart from INR, the other currency that I regularly deal with is the US Dollar. When the economy was hitting rock bottom it was booming times for me. Instead of the regular INR 38-43 against a Dollar, I got incredible conversion rates which went up to INR 50-51, good times I say! But since this does not happen all that frequently there comes the need to safeguard my interest. I recommend the following:<br /><br />1. If you are starting out as a freelancer, you can afford to <span style="font-weight: bold;">bear some of the fluctuations</span>. After all this might result in a lower final amount that you quote to the client and make it work in your favor.<br /><br />2. The other thing that I have constantly done is to leave my money in my PayPal account when the rates are too low. I have often experienced that these <span style="font-weight: bold;">currency fluctuations are quite temporary</span> and your patience might prevent you from bearing a loss. So if you can afford to leave your funds as it is for some time then this might work!<br /><br />3. If you are using the services of payment gateways like PayPal then it is suggested that you go ahead and <span style="font-weight: bold;">check with all the kind of accounts</span> that they offer. You need to select the one which best fits your need as all of them have different rates which they charge.<br /><br />4. The fourth and the most effective way to beat the currency punches is to go ahead and <span style="font-weight: bold;">increase your rates</span>. You need to convince your clients that the final quoted rate allows you to cushion your loss as well as justifies the efforts needed in the project too. <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">But what to do if you are getting into a long term contract?</span><br />I suggest that if you are getting into a contract with your client then you can go ahead and suggest adding a clause to it that the price will be reviewed after say a period of 5 months and based on the currency conversion rate at that point consequent changed would be made to the price. This will not only cushion your cause but at the same time put you forward as a good professional too.<br /><br />Currency can surely be tricky but it is very important that you manage your finances well and charge an amount which is not only justifiable but at the same time allows you to make a decent profit too.<br /></div>Niha Redhu Realistic Blueprint For Fresher's To Help Build Their Portfolio<div style="text-align: justify;"><br /><br />Just like in any other field of work, fresher’s starting out as freelancers too have to face their share of difficulty trying to convince clients of their capability and competence. The most important fact that works against them here is the absence of any prior experience in the field which could strengthen their credentials. So what does one do? This is a realistic situation as everyone who is someone today was at some point of time a pure fresher himself. So what did he do differently that made him sit where he is today? The answer is in the approach.<br /><br />Any individual who is really serious about excelling in his field will be careful enough to scan his target market and chalk out his game plan before he would think of getting clients. It is usually seen that fresher’s are more than eager to start working and for the same they get ready to work for rock bottom prices. This is surely not the right way ahead. By this I do not mean that an individual should start quoting sky high and illogical price quotes but yes, the figure quotes should amply justify the hard work that you would be putting in towards the project. There are some simple steps that you can do here towards building your portfolio:<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Blogs</span>– An excellent way to start building your portfolio would be to straightaway go ahead and launch your own blog. Your personal blog will not only provide you the perfect chance to showcase your work but at the same time allow you to get live feedback from readers in the form of comments which could further help you refine your skills.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Working For Non-Profits</span> – Though writing for free is never advised but this is surely one area where writing for free would not hurt. The reason is that if the nonprofit is a big name then it could be the perfect image building chance that you could want. A good PR move it could work as a perfect reference for you and lend a big help towards your credibility and image. On the other hand, writing for free for a normal webmaster whom no one would have heard of just to gain experience would be of no good.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Article Marketing</span> – The main purpose of availing the services of article websites on the <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">internet</span> is to try and get some marketing value out of your articles. These articles could act as samples which you can send to prospective clients. But there is a catch here too. It is usually seen that many freelance writers write and submit articles to large, non specific and general article directories. Instead, I have always felt that it a good idea to write and submit your articles to niche article sites or to blogs which cater to your specific domain and specialty area. The reason for this is that these specific and niche websites and blogs carry more credibility and come with a built-in audience than the general non specific article directories do. They provide you a chance to link to prospective clients easily thereby allowing you easy and quick access to future assignments.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Websites For Freelancers</span> – When staring out as a freelancer one can also make use of several websites which allow you look for freelance projects posted on their forums and allow you to try and bid for the same. Some of these websites are good starting places for beginning writers while others will help you build a network or even outsource some of your work. But freelancers need to beware as most of these websites need you to become their member for a fee in order to access their entire gamut of projects. Also it is seen that on most of these websites it is very difficult to get paid decent amounts for your work as most of the clients here are on the lookout for freelancers who can deliver the work at rock bottom prices. But yes, with patience and careful segregation it is possible to land up with some good options here.<br /><br /><br /></div>Niha Redhu Genuine Is That New Prospective Lead?<div style="text-align: justify;"><br /><br />For all freelancers, any kind of incoming client lead is good. But not always do these leads transcribe into actual clients. In my case, I have had so many leads lose their shine when they turn out to be in quest of one single aim- free advice. I have had this happening quite often especially when I started out as a freelancer. It is not that I am against providing advice but you <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">shouldn't</span>’t add all that value for free — whether for a client who wants more than they’re willing to pay, or one who <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1">isn</span>’t really serious about the project in the first place.<br /><br />There have been times when I was contacted by prospects expecting me to do all their marketing panning as well as suggestions towards structuring the content of their websites for free. <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_2">Scheduled</span> meetings to ‘discuss’ the projects have often turned into the same.<br /><br />So how does one differentiate as to if this new lead you are in touch with is another of these free advice seeker or is a genuine prospective client?<br /><br />Imagine a situation wherein you get in touch with a new prospect and start talking with him regarding the project. The client seems genuine and you share with him some good conversations and laughs. Conversations with that client leave you on a high and you simply feel the rush to start to work for him. But when you start discussing the actual modalities of the project including the budget and the deadline, the client seems to be at his indecisive best. My advice here, BACK OFF!<br /><br />In 95% of the situations I have seen that such clients do not end up giving any work and all they seek is an estimate for the project and like in the previous case, free advice!<br /><br />So this leaves us with the same question. How does a freelancer decide if the client is really just another pretender? The following rules that I always abide by work for me:<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Enquire about the project budget</span>: If the prospective lead is serious about the project and are actually on the lookout for a specialist then they’ll have a budget. On the other hand, the pretenders will either completely try to skirt this topic or else will start tossing out unrealistically low figures.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ask for the project deadline</span>: An inconclusive and sketchy answer here simply spells trouble. If they don’t value a project enough to schedule it, then don’t expect to get paid for it too!<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ask for mutual contracts to be signed</span>: There is nothing more that pretenders get scared from than legal bindings on paper.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Insist for an advance payment</span>: Prospective clients meaning business would understand your need of saving your interest with an initial payment and very often agree for the same. Pretenders on the other hand would stop their communication right there!<br /><br />As a freelancer you really need to start understanding that there is truly nothing called as "free lunches". The lunch meeting that you might have to go for right now with a lead just might not be the expected free lunch offered by him but one of the tricks up his sleeves to try and play around with your experience. BEWARE!<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>Niha Redhu Inspired Entry<div style="text-align: justify;"><br />It is very rare that you will find me inserting actual scripts from a blog that I would have read. But this is one instance when I just could not hold myself from doing it. The blog was written in such an inspiring way that i thought of sharing it with everyone here.<br /><br />The blog was about how freelancers should price their work. The article says: " <span style="font-style: italic;">A person’s willingness to pay for something is directly related to the value they see in it. And like it or not, that value may be as fluffy as “a better life”. Or it may be something quite straight-forward that you just don’t realise. Either way, if you don’t charge correctly for that value, you lose</span>." Rightly said!<br /><br />The article goes on to say that " <span style="font-style: italic;">frequently freelancers and young agencies in the web industry lose business because they over-value their work. Be honest, how often have you cursed the other guys that won the job on price? The cowboys. The jokers that couldn’t mark up a holding page. Idiots. Their own site doesn’t even validate! But all that happened was that you tried to sell your expertise to someone that just didn’t value it. And can you blame them? Maybe their site needs to describe their business and provide contact details, but doesn’t need the latest, greatest HTML 5 tricks? They don’t give a damn about “perfect” markup and neither do their customers. So why would they pay for it? Would you pay €20 for a pint if the barman told you he’s serving it in his favourite glass, made by a famous, naked, dancing, glass-blowing tribe from Brazil?</span>"<br /><br />What stands out here is the fact that the freelancer needs to understand the requirement of the client. It is OK to try and sell your services to him but this should not overshadow the basic requirement that the client seeks. Accordingly, this should form the basis as to how you would charge the client. Charge him for what he wants and not for all that, that you can offer! PERIOD.<br /><br />Rightly stated in the article is "<span style="font-style: italic;">nine times out of ten, your clients value only your availability, flexibility and malleability, not your sweet Javascript skills. Price downwards accordingly.</span>"<br /><br />The entire article is available <a href="">here</a>.<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>Niha Redhu Taste Of Fashion Writing<div style="text-align: justify;"><br /><br />Sometimes there are some projects which come your way which you think you would not be able to handle. I have had one similar experience lately. I got in touch with a gentlemen via one of the social networking websites that I frequent on when I he enquired if I was up for another assignment. I requested him to send me details for the assignment and that I would get in touch with him after I go through the same.<br /><br />The gentleman was kind enough to send me an elaborate <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">description</span> of what he exactly wanted. In his words... "<span style="font-style: italic;">We are creating a portal for branded fashion in India.This is fashion which middle and upper middle class can afford, and is a step below the designer fashion which only ultra rich and Page3 personalities wear. We want to target the fashion which common youngster can wear to college or office.</span>" They wanted content for articles in content of the same. It was not a one time assignment and it required a regular relay of articles on the desired requirement. This had me thinking for a moment. The hesitation was not because of the time commitment but mostly because fashion was one domain where i was completely naive. I was not sure if I could do justice to the articles and if I had it in me to bring out the desired elements that would have the fashion <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1">conscious</span> readers hooked and interested. It had me thinking hard. I spoke to the people involved in the project and this made me a little more comfortable as I liked the people I would be working with.<br /><br />I was required to submit a sample article initially following the guidelines provided to me by the client. This was going to be the acid test for me. I decided that if this article met my satisfaction and if I liked the process I would seriously give this assignment a thought. And as it turned out that i really liked the whole process of digging into this new territory. The people in the <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_2">team</span> were eager to help out and provided me with candid feedback regarding the sample. This further cemented my <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_3">decision</span> and now I am on with this team writing for them good about 4 articles per week.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Clients brief</span>: <span style="font-style: italic;">The language has to be simple, something that the young kids could connect you and enjoy reading it.

It is worth noticing that taking his relaxed look to a new level are his uber cool pair of Aviator sunglasses.

What works in the favor of Aviator sunglasses are that not only do they help shield your eyes, but they do it stylishly! They are very versatile and can be worn just about anywhere as they are extremely comfortable..... These sunglasses are ideal for everyday eyewear both for men and women. In the case of women they can so easily toughen up a feminine frock and for men they go ahead and provide a touch of street style chic to the normal pair of jeans and a jacket. </span><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">With large rectangular frames and metal rims, these glasses are available in several different colour tints for people to choose from and to team them with their dresses. </span><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">When shopping for sunglasses it is important that you try on several pairs so that you end up with the one which you feel most comfortable wearing. There are some tips which can help you zero down on that perfect pair which would suit your face the best.</span>...<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>Niha Redhu Options Beyond PayPal<div style="text-align: justify;"><br /><br />For any service provider it is very important that they have in place the right kind of payment machinery to facilitate easy and safe payment towards their services. As a freelance writer I had till now made use of the services of <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">PayPal</span> to receive payment for my overseas assignments. But due to the recent developments at <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1">PayPal</span> as a result of which they temporarily suspended their India operations I was left looking for option. It was then that I realised that there might be some others like me who too would be looking for alternative options to <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_2">receive</span> their payments from abroad. Listed below are some of the major options that you can consider:<br /><br />1.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> By cheque</span>: Your client can mail you the cheque for the required amount. Once you get the cheque you can deposit the same in your bank and get the amount credited in your account. The biggest pitfall for this mode of payment is the time duration. The time taken by the cheque to get cleared by your bank is usually very long and if you are in need of funds immediately then surely this method would not work well for you.<br /><br />2. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Wire Transfer</span>: If waiting for your cheque to get credited is not what you would ideally want then the next best option here would be to opt for a wire transfer. You would be required to share your bank information(including your bank <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_3">account</span> number) with your client who can then make the payment. This method also entitles a fee in order to get the money through.<br /><br />3. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Credit card</span>: If you have in place a merchant account then you can go ahead and ask your clients to pay with a credit card too. Not only is this convenient in <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_4">today's</span> time but also appeals to most clients. <a href="">2Checkout.com</a> is one such website which allows you to open a merchant account and move ahead smoothly.<br /><br />4. <span style="font-weight: bold;" class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_5">XOOM</span>: This online payment option allows you to send and <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_6">receive</span> funds from any country to any country in the world. Albeit coming with a small fee to send money this online payment option has recently caught the liking of many. All that you need to do here is to to create an account with <a href=""><span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_7">xoom</span></a> and then send your details to your payer. He will then use your details and send across the money either using his credit card or directly from his bank account. The money then reaches the bank partner in your country from where you can have access to the same.<br /><br />5. <span style="font-weight: bold;" class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_8">Moneybookers</span>: Another good option to have access to your online payments. Working on the lines of <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_9">PayPal</span>, <a href="">moneybookers</a> requires you to open an account with it and send/ <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_10">receive</span> funds.

Super Cool!<div style="text-align: justify;"><br />Work with <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">iTrip</span> is going on well. Am already done writing 5 blog posts for them and each of them were unique in a different way. Like I always say that what I like the best about my job is that I get to learn and know so many new things. Something on the same lines happened with <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1">iTrip</span> too. I was to write a blog entry for them wherein their competitor (lets say company X) would be putting forward their <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_2">advertisement</span> during the Super Bowl!<br /><br />My task here was to research on this very <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_3">advertisement</span> that company X plans to launch, bring in the advantages of advertising during the <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_4">Superbowl</span> and then link company X with <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_5">iTrip</span>! Interesting I say!<br /><br />What I loved doing the most here was to research on the super bowl <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_6">advertisements</span>. With a sports crazy dad and husband here with me I had to know what super bowl was all about but never realised the potential that it could hold. Anyways, this assignment was a true blessing in disguise <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_7">coz</span> I could now understand the financial implications behind having the chance to air your promotions during that valuable time space of the super bowl.<br /><br />Clients Brief: <span style="font-style: italic;">write me a blog on the super bowl advertisement that company X is doing during the super bowl. And how both them and <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_8">iTrip</span> is riding the same wave. Research on the up coming ad and tie <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_9">iTrip</span> into the blog in a positive way. </span><br /><br />Neat I say!<br /><br />With my job pretty much chalked out I knew what all I needed to focus on. I wanted to introduce <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_10">iTrip</span> in the article in a very <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_11">subtle</span> way so that it does not overpower the article. The article had to be based on company X but what i wanted the content to do was to make the reader leave the article with a clear recognition of <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_12">iTrip</span>.<br /><br />Here is what parts of the final approved article looked like:<br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Drawing millions of viewers from around the world, the Super Bowl has produced some of the most memorable and effective commercials in the history of television. Interestingly, such is the craze of these super bowl commercials that a large chunk of its viewers tune in to watch Super Bowl just to catch these commercials. Producing an ad for Game Day is a huge strategic marketing task for any big company that can manage to afford the price tag associated with it......</span><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">......Hoping to reap similar benefit is the Austin based vacation rental company X. This company is making its first foray into Super Bowl advertising during CBS telecast of the February 7 game and aims towards successfully engaging people by means of their commercial to want them to see more. By means of this commercial, X wishes to capture the essence and need of proper accommodation while on a vacation and ..... Vacation Rental Companies like X and <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_13">iTrip</span> wish to serve the generation of ....What makes these vacation rentals all the more popular and interesting and finds a mention in this X commercial too, is the fact that this facility of vacation rentals can be availed at a cost which is far less than what you would end up paying for a hotel accommodation. </span><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">So when you go ahead and opt for vacation rentals offered by companies like <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_14">iTrip</span> and X, not only do you end up enjoying your holiday but at the same time you end up saving your money too! An exposure into the world of Super Bowl commercials will prove out to be good for vacation rental companies like X and <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_15">iTrip</span>. It will help them to take care of the low consumer awareness towards vacation rentals and will provide potential travelers with an additional accommodation option to consider when they plan their next vacation. ...</span><br /><br /><br /></div>Niha Redhu Projects, New Waters To be Tested.. Bring Them On!<div style="text-align: justify;"><br /><br />Personally this new year has begun with a mixed bag of goodies. I may have had to take it slow owing to some bad eating episodes which landed me with strange sounding medical issues but then what is important is making the most of what you have. I too made the most of this rest time which does show now on my reduced typing speed! ;) Too much of everything is bad they say huh... yeah yeah <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">ok</span>!<br /><br />Anyways, speaking on the work front, things have started to look interesting here.. I was in talks with a few individuals regarding writing assignments and from the bunch a few of them do look to be turning positive. I have been asked by a travel website- <a href=""><span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1">itrip</span></a> to write a couple of blog posts for their blog each week. A travel and a vacation rental website, the blog posts here have to be centered around a few specific keywords.<br /><br />Client: <a href="">itrip</a><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Client Brief</span>: <span style="font-style: italic;">A good write up centered around the provided keywords. A check on the keyword density is required and the language needs to be attractive yet persuasive to enable customers and readers to give the services of <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_2">itrip</span> a try. </span><br /><br />After analyzing the content of the clients website and reading the previous blog posts as well as the range of services offered by <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_3">itrip</span> I made a brief for myself wherein I realized that ideally the content for <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_4">the</span> blog posts should:<br /><br />1. Have a good description of the destination from a tourist's point of view.<br />2. The rental services offered by <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_5">itrip</span> should be mentioned clearly.<br />3. And lastly a <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_6">connection</span> between the above two should be created as to how <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_7">itrip</span> could help make a vacation to this place all the more better.<br /><br />Following this I sent my first article last night to the client and got his approval too.<br /><br />A couple of sections from this write up is pasted below for you guys to have a look.<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">There are some beach destinations which provide guests with serene scenic beauty and then there are some which appeal to party hoppers and crowd seekers.

The year 2009 provided me the chance to try out different genres of projects. Some of them were technical and completely new to me. One similar category was that of medical writing, or simply said, article pertaining to diseases or medicine. There are some points which are required to be kept in mind when writing the content for these medical articles.<br /><br />1. Since these are medical articles therefore it is very important to get the facts correct and verified. If the <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">internet</span> is used to carry out research then it is extremely important to validate the website that you are using to source the data/information for your article. There are several reputed medical websites that you can use for your research. These include <cite style="font-style: italic;">; and.</cite><span style="font-style: italic;"> <span style="font-style: italic;"></span></span><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;"></span>2. There is very little scope of playing around with the content here as most of these articles have a strict vocabulary that they need to adhere too.<br /><br />3. It is generally preferred that these kind of articles have with them the list of references that were used/ consulted while drafting its content. This would make it easy for the readers to go back and consult the original paper if they seek any further clarifications.<br /><br />4. There are strict principles to be followed when one goes ahead and writes the references. There is a fixed pattern to be followed while doing so. Ideally the <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1">reference</span> should include; the authors name, the title of the work, a sub title if any, the publisher and the date when it was published. An example here world be <span style="font-style: italic;">Tierney, John (2006) Criminology: Theory and Context. 2<span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_2">nd</span> Ed. Harlow:</span><br /> <span style="font-style: italic;">Pearson/<span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_3">Longman</span></span>. It is very important to remain <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_4">consistent</span> with the pattern <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_5">that</span> you follow.<br /><br />5. Most of these medical articles include in them several definitions. It is very important not to alter the terms and language of these definitions and to try and use them as they are. It would be just like trying to formulate Newtons Law Of Motion in your own words! Pure catastrophe.<br /><br />Keep these tips in mind and writing medical essays will no longer be a dreaded nightmare. <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_6">Believe</span> me.. I am the perfect case of been there seen all!! :)<br /><br /><br /></div>Niha Redhu Wish For A Stocking Big Enough..<div style="text-align: justify;"><br /><br />Dear Santa,<br /><br />As I write this blog post Google tells me that you have already crossed over most of the eastern hemisphere and are now over Korea so I better hurry up with this!<br />My wish list aint all that complicated and I am sure you can manage it :)<br /><br />1. Please get me some good client referrals the next year. I have been lucky enough to have some extremely good and valuable clients this year and a couple of new additions to the list surely will not hurt me!<br /><br />2. I would love to work more with clients who believed in me and my talent and gave me the freedom to work on the assignment my way. Trust me I will not let you down here!<br /><br />2. It would be great it you could just about add a couple of extra hours every day. Would love to spend it learning a new hobby.<br /><br />3. Could you also sneak in some good leads of writers whom i would love to follow?!<br /><br />4. Santa, I could so do with a separate room for my work so if you could magically make my 2 BHK apartment into a 3 BHK one then it would be awesome!<br /><br />5. I would love to add to my collection of books so a one year free gift subscription of The Landmark would be the icing on the cake.<br /><br />6. I am seriously not a sucker for electronics but if you are so insistent then a Kindle would be fine! ;)<br /><br />That's about it. Did i not tell you that I will not be too demanding?! Also as a parting gift could you try removing chocolates and cakes from the unhealthy list and moving it to the healthy list ehh?!<br /><br />Ohh that reminds me, do you need some new content on your website Santa?? ;) Feel free to contact me.. For you I can surely come up with a good negotiation price!! What say Santa??!! I am waiting!!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>Niha Redhu Year Of The Ox Gets Ready To Give Way To The Year Of The Tiger!<div style="text-align: justify;"><br />The year 2009 is almost gone. Yes, once more the time comes when we sit and wonder as to how soon the year went by. So while we do the thinking I thought of listing together what all was special at my end for the year 2009!<br /><br />1. The year bought with it a good and a promising flow of projects for me to work on. Also, I got my 1st regular content writing client whose monthly pay checks are now responsible for the ‘almost visible’ savings in my account! Thank you Henrik! :)<br /><br />2. My portfolio too was a witness to steady progress when it moved from its word format to a <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">pdf</span> format in 2008 to its latest online version in 2009. Yes, <a href=""><span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1">Niha</span> <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_2">Redhu</span></a> got live in 2009!<br /><br />3. 2009 also saw me getting introduced to the ‘all the while sitting there’ world of social networking. An account on Twitter followed and with it came a whole bunch of good connections and amazing friends. My account on <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_3">LinkedIn</span> created ages ago was also taken out of the cobwebs and dusted. Finally I had in place the means to get connected to the ‘right’ people.<br /><br />4. The year was also dedicated to the memory of the ‘big fat Indian get together’ which had me and my husband jet hopping at regular intervals to the various longitudes and latitudes of the country.<br /><br />5. We also finally managed the long awaited trip to Goa! Yeah well let’s not stray longer here as I might just give into the temptation of buying tickets again for the New Years In ago! Highly tempting I say!<br /><br />6. Oh and yes, I finally have a designated space as my ‘office’ in my house. Though I share the space with the treadmill, the ironing board, the husband’s utterly precious, ‘highly loaded’ desktop as well as the shoe rack I STILL did manage to find some space for myself in that very room! Highly efficient I say! :)<br /><br />7. I also finally managed to get rid of my pricing inhibitions and could start quoting rates for my writing services confidently! You might not believe but when I started freelancing, any new project always made nervous as to how much should I quote for the assignment and if I could actually deliver on the needed requirements! Surely practice makes a man perfect and in my case confident!<br /><br />8. On my personal front, the year was a mixed bag. With the occasional bouts of illnesses we did have our fair share of visits to the clinics as well. Not disappointing us this time too was our frequent food expeditions and with the decent help of a fair amount of <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_4">diegene</span> tablets we did manage to dig out some fairly good eating joints in Bangalore! A complete foodie couple is what we are!<br /><br />9. We also managed to take time out and do our share of travelling this year which included a trip to Goa( from here both of us came back looking like a native West Indies couple), a trip to <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_5">Humpi</span>( with limited electricity, no telephones and ATM’s it was a complete backpackers holiday) and our lip smacking French cuisine journey along with the shopping spree in <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_6">Pondicherry</span>(the wood fired Pizza’s and the melting garlic <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_7">naans</span> were absolute killers!). <br /><br />Dear happy God <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_8">ji</span>, I look towards the next year with hope and lots of expectations. Hope that it has in store for me more exciting projects, more exciting (would surely not mind exotic too) vacations and the chance to meet a whole new bunch of friends and people. <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_9">Ohh</span> and yes, the occasional reassuring jingle from my bank account too would be appreciated!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>Niha Redhu The Most Of The Free Time<div style="text-align: justify;"><br /><br />It is that time of the year again when festivities are in the air. As expected there is also a pitfall in the number of assignments up for grabs as probable clients in the US and Europe have virtually shut down their shops for the holidays. This left me with some good time on my hands to utilize on tasks which i felt had been kept neglected since long. To start with my website, i was since long wanting to update my portfolio as well as certain sections on the website. There was also the months old deliberation going in my head regarding putting up my prices on the website or not. Finally I did decide to do that. Results and effects on that change are highly awaited though! :)The work on the website was not all that much but yes the time was always a factor. Finally I got that sorted out and have the additions made to the website.<br /><br />My reader too is about to burst to the seems with the huge number of unread blog <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">entries</span> that it is managing. I will be truthful when i say that in the recent months my reading time had reduced considerably owing to the number of assignments I was handling. So I am back with a <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1">vengeance</span> to get back on my reading. I am also in the process of rearranging my list on the reader by removing some blogs and adding some new names to it.<br /><br />I would also like to devote some time to my blog while I am free and try and pen down some good posts at regular intervals. I guess <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_2">this</span> is something that all of us should do when there is not enough work on our hands. I know so many individuals who utilize their free time writing down and creating a stock of blogs which they then go ahead and post later on at regular intervals. Smart move I say!<br /><br />The other thing which i need to work on are my social networking networks. Connecting to new connections and getting back in touch with the old ones will help me get some conversations on! :)<br /><br />But then i also advocate the fact that one surely needs some time to get out and spend some time doing things to fresh up and get back the energy. So it might be a day out with friends, or a night out at the club anything which you enjoy doing is something which you should try.<br /><br />For me it will be adding some new books to my library, adding some new plants to my '<span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_3">minuscule</span>' garden up here on the first floor and <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_4">of course</span> catching up with old friends and the latest gossips doing the rounds now a days! Believe me it helps perk you help.. yes males and females both! :D<br /><br />What about you? What do you do to spend your free time?<br /><br /><br /></div>Niha Redhu Updated!<div style="text-align: justify;"><br /><br />It was long due for me to get my <a href="">portfolio</a> on my <a href="">website</a> updated. Finally got it done last week. Have added to it my latest assignments which include web content generation for websites as well as content for a brochure.<br /><br />The other changes in there is <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">the</span> content for the '<a href="">About Me</a>' section. There is so much to <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1">Niha</span> than what I thought I had in there previously! So thought of adding some more content to it.. <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_2">naah</span> no self promotion for sure!! You get me as I am.. straight from the heart! :)<br /><br /><input id="gwProxy" type="hidden"><!--Session data--><input onclick="jsCall();" id="jsProxy" type="hidden"></div><div style="text-align: justify;" id="refHTML"></div>Niha Redhu Writing Price List Finally Goes Public!<div style="text-align: justify;"><br /><br />I had been long <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">contemplating</span> and debating on <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1">the</span> fact that should I or <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_2">shouldn't</span> go ahead and replace the standard and safe 'request a quote' web page on my website with my writing rates. The variable in consideration were plenty and so were the advices which came my way. I decided to take a fair perspective. So with a paper and pen I sat down and made 2 columns on the paper and started listing out the advantages and disadvantages which I could think of regarding posting my writing prices on my website.<br /><br />Both the columns seemed to have equal number of points! But then deep inside i knew that it was the right time to bring out my writing rates. There was just <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_3">one</span> problem which was nagging me regarding it and that was the point that by posting my writing prices I would be reducing my chances of potential client interactions as they would now not be contacting me if they feel that my writing services prices are beyond their reach. But it did not take me long to <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_4">realise</span> that if these viewers did like my work and <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_5">seeked</span> quality work on their projects then they would by all means approach me!<br /><br />The other factor that stood out was that now I would be able to concentrate my time only on a handful of clients who would be now knowing what price to expect for their project so that we could go ahead and <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_6">straight</span> away concentrate on the project. Believe me, when you work as a freelancer, the most time consuming task can be the one when you have to reply to queries regarding the prices charged and the ones which start a price negotiating cycle.<br /><br />My profession of freelance web writing has many writers who provide content for as low as $1 per page. So by putting up my writing price list I wish to finally and once and for all declare it that no I am NOT one of them. I love my profession and I ensure that my work reflects the same passion and <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_7">dedication</span>. My writing price list is justified by the quality of my work that I deliver. So if you get what you want for your project I too have the right to charge logically for the same right?<br /><br /><span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_8">After all</span>, what I am bringing in is <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_9">transparency</span> and ease so that clients seeking a web content writer will know what to expect! You can check out the content writing rates at my <a href="">website</a> and let me know what you think!<br /><br /><br /><br /></div><input id="gwProxy" type="hidden"><!--Session data--><input onclick="jsCall();" id="jsProxy" type="hidden"><div id="refHTML"></div>Niha Redhu Was The Buzz Word This Week!<div style="text-align: justify;"> <br /> <br />This week has been a hectic one for sure.. For starters my regular wok too came not in cart loads but in truck fulls and then along came two new projects too. The first project was content writing for a consulting website. <br /> <br />Client: Castle Consultants <br /> <br />The client wanted content on specific guidelines to be used for their financial consulting section. Since the client was expecting some good contracts in a couple of days there fore the requirement of having the content and putting <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">the</span> same on the website as soon as possible was a necessity. Having said that, the complexity <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1">aggravated</span> with the fact that the topics I had to write on were completely new to me! The client did provide me with a foot hold to start on but I knew that i had to get my basics clear before i attempted writing. <br /> <br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Clients brief: The content should be crisp, <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_2">targeting</span> to a niche of customers, should bring out genuineness and credibility as well as sound <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_3">professional</span>. </span> <br /> <br />I had expected before hand that the assignment was going to be a bit tough and yes it surely was. Tough as in the fact that i needed to understand the topics, understand the requirement and deliver on the same in a span of 2 days. The client was patient enough to go through my drafts and suggest modifications. 2 rounds of modifications followed before the final content was settled for. Now when I look back at <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_4">this</span> particular assignment I can analyze that what took me the most time here was to get in the right customer <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_5">targeting</span>. I was blocking my usage to a couple of words only which when I rectified saw things falling in place. <br /> <br />Since I cannot post the entire content here I will copy a part of the content that the assignment for you have an idea... <br /> <br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Government <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_6">Liaising</span> & Product Launch</span> <br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Castle Consultants aspires to make your business dealing with various government agencies completely hassle free.

The requirement here was a bit unique. The client has the entire literature ready but wanted help to convert it into a script. A script that the presenter would present in front of the crowd in the workshop. <br /> <br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Client Brief: The script should be conversational. The language should not be heavy email type but rather the funky <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_12">sms</span> lingo type. There should be enough punches to make the entire script funny and therefore be able to keep <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_13">the</span> audience hooked. The principle of connect and disconnect using live situational example too should be incorporated.</span> <br /> <br />Since it would be presented by a young presenter therefore <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_14">the</span> tone of the script had to be young and fresh. The task involved me having to go through various fashion blogs and websites dedicated to styling of men and have in hand some funky instances and quotes which i could use. The best way that i thought was to approach the project was to imagine <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_15">myself</span> speaking the entire thing in front of the crowd. This bought <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_16">sentences</span> into my head. Since I was new to scripting the client also suggested a wonderful idea that i take each topic as a scene and then work on it. Working on in part by part really helped. <br /> <br />Find below a part of the script that I have sent to the client for his feedback. -IN;} -style: italic;">If you wish to adorn you shirt with a cuff link then first you need to have crisp white French cuffed shirt to qualify!

But it is seen that even this free at will work regime crumbles under the toll of stress if not managed properly. I too suffered from the same issue a few months after I started working as a freelance content writer. But then slowly i also realised means and ways to control it. It is important to find that '<span style="font-weight: bold;">perfect' stress buster</span> that works the best for you. Not because it will help you increase your productivity at work but also because it will keep you happy and spirited. In my case I have found the following work best for me to help control/combat stress.<br /><br />1. I <span style="font-weight: bold;">limit the work</span> which I take. For any freelancer the chance to work on multiple projects seems to be <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1">the</span> best that could be possible but one does not realise <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_2">the</span> amount of stress it gets with it. <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_3">when</span> you have with you much more work than what you could easily handle then you are bound to feel the pressure of delivering on time. I have also <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_4">realised</span> that when I am working on several projects at one go it kind of decreases my work output and the results too could have been better. I have therefore made it a point to work only on a few projects at one go and deliver my best towards them.<br /><br />2. I now <span style="font-weight: bold;">make a schedule</span> and most importantly STICK to it. It is important to have a rough time plan for everyday when one starts work. What is more important is that one stops work when the time is up. This will ensure that you get some quality time for yourself.<br /><br />3. I find taking <span style="font-weight: bold;">small breaks</span> thought my work schedule very helpful. I make use of these breaks to read a book, cook a quick snack or listen to some music. I refrain from using this time doing something sitting at my work place. What is important for these breaks is that that you move away from your work place and feel fresh.<br /><br />4. I also get stressed when i see myself moving behind deadlines. In my case the major culprit here are the distractions in the form twitter, <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_5">face book</span> and emails. To control this I have now slotted fixed time slots in my schedule when i go and attend to them and therefore do not spend my time checking for mails and notification <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_6">randomly</span>.<br /><br />These tips work for me but might not for you. what is important is that you identify those for yourself and then stick to it. You yourself will be amazed by the positive results that you see for yourself in your routine.<br /><br /><br /></div>Niha Redhu First: MBA Essays<div style="text-align: justify;"><br /><br />Lately I have been occupied helping a friend with his essays for his MBA applications. With the list of institutes <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">amounting</span> to 4 there are good about 12 odd essays to tackle. Till now I had not worked on this kind of project because of 2 main reasons. Firstly, none came my way and secondly I was too scared to try looking for them! :) yeah.. i <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1">don't</span> know why but the thought that the person's career depended on these essays was enough to scare me off! But when this my friend approached me for help I could not say no and therefore took it as a shot to scare the thought off.<br /><br />Working with these essays there were some main things which stood out:<br />1. The <span style="font-weight: bold;">word limit</span>! This can turn out to be the most <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_2">excruciating</span> part of the entire exercise as it is very difficult to round up such <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_3">elaborate</span> topics within the said word limit.<br />2. The aim of <span style="font-weight: bold;">grabbing the attention</span> of the reader right from the first <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_4">sentence</span>. I thought of the fact that the aim here is to grab the attention of the reader in the midst of thousands of odd applications and for <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_5">the</span> same it <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_6">was</span> required that it have a good start. Also an <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_7">impactful</span> ending which can leave the reader curious will increase the probability of your application being selected.<br />3. Not making the essay sound drab and mechanical. It is very important to <span style="font-weight: bold;">make it feel personal </span>and something which is right from the heart.<br />4. Refraining from using too many big words. It is best to <span style="font-weight: bold;">make use of simple words</span> and short <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_8">sentences</span> in your <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_9">essays</span>. An overdose of too many big words will make it sound very artificial.<br />5. Never exaggerate and spin tales in your <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_10">essays</span>. You <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_11">have</span> to remember that your interview will very much be <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_12">based</span> on your <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_13">essays</span> so it is important to stick to true facts. <br />6. Keep in mind to keep all your <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_14">essays</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">in the same flow</span> and ensure that you do not end up disputing your own thoughts in your <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_15">essays</span>. They should all have a common theme revolving around them.<br /><br />Since the essays have not been submitted I cannot show them here. So it is going to be some wait till I can put them here. It will be a great opportunity to showcase that rare "before" and "after" moment! :)<br /><br /><br /></div>Niha Redhu Link For The Not-For Profit Dance Foundation<div style="text-align: justify;"><br /><br />My last content writing assignment, the not for profit dance foundation is up and live.

One very frustrating aspect of my work is that I don't always get the
chance to take good photographs of it. My workshop usually
makes a poor and very cluttered backdrop and I can't always take decent
photographs after installation. There are many reasons for this and just
some of these are; poor weather or light, a messy background such as
a building site, backgrounds that clash with the work or cause it to
blend in to the background. Sometimes there just isn't time to take photographs
after installation and since my work is often installed throughout the
UK (..and further!)
I don't always get the opportunity to return to do so. Sometimes I have
the work delivered by pallet couriers and rely on my customers to take
and send some photographs. Sometimes I just forget to take my camera.
Arghhh!!!
These gates are a good example of
this. They are full of interesting detail and were installed in Barnsley
in 2007 but I haven't yet been able to photograph them properly. I'm
hoping to do so in a week or so but meanwhile here are a few tasters.Chronic. The increase is part of a shift in global mortality patterns in which infectious diseases, such as malaria and tuberculosis, have declined substantially and are no longer the leading cause of death in the developing world.
The shift in poorer countries is being driven by urbanization and other major changes that have led to improvements in aspects of public health, such as hand washing, sanitation and vaccines. That has led to sharp declines in infant mortality, and in turn, to increases in life spans. The average life expectancy in Africa, for example, has increased by about eight years since 2000, according to the World Health Organization.
Chronic diseases claim the vast majority of lives in rich countries like the United States, and some experts have said that the rise of such diseases in poorer countries is actually a sign of success, as it is evidence that people in those places are now living long enough to die of diseases that typically hit in old age.
But the report — which uses yet-to-be-published 2013 data from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, a health research organization — finds that chronic diseases are disproportionately striking younger populations in developing countries.
Working-age people in poorer countries have little access to preventive care and more exposure to health risks, such as air pollution, poor nutrition and lax antismoking laws, than their counterparts in rich countries, and are more likely to develop a chronic disease. And with limited resources to pay for treatment, those with chronic diseases are much more likely to become disabled and die as a result.Continue reading the main story
In all, about 80 percent of the deaths and disabilities from chronic diseases in Africa and South Asia involved people under the age of 60, more than double the share in many rich countries, said Thomas J. Bollyky, a fellow at the council and one of the report’s authors. In lower-income countries in particular, about 40 percent of the deaths from chronic diseases occur in people younger than 60, compared with 13 percent in rich countries.
If the trend continues unabated, it could have far-reaching consequences, the report stated, including catastrophic health expenditures and impoverishment among low-income populations. At the national level, it would further strain already overburdened health systems and could lead to lower economic productivity.
In rich countries, mortality patterns changed slowly, over generations, giving health systems time to adapt. But in poorer countries, the changes are often happening too fast for threadbare health care systems that are still geared toward treating infectious diseases to cope. The report notes that spending on health care in middle- and low-income countries has tripled over the past 20 years but that it is still small: All the governments in sub-Saharan Africa together spend about as much on health care a year as Poland — about $30 billion.
Chronic diseases are finding a foothold among much poorer people, who are less able to afford the medicines and treatment that might mitigate their illnesses. In rural Ghana, for example, minimum-wage earners with diabetes spend 60 percent of their incomes on insulin, the report noted.
Chronic diseases that are treatable in developed countries are often death sentences in developing countries, the report notes. For example, 90 percent of children with leukemia in high-income countries can be cured, but 90 percent of those with that disease in the world’s 25 poorest countries die from it.
The report, whose contributors include Thomas E. Donilon, a former national security adviser in the Obama administration, and Mitch Daniels, a former governor of Indiana and director of the Office of Management and Budget under President George W. Bush, called on the United States to make chronic disease a priority in global health funding. The United States spent more than $8 billion on global health aid in 2013, but just $10 million went to fight noncommunicable diseases.Continue reading the main storySome good, some not so good stories.

A Placebo Effect • shortstory by Brian C. Coad
A retired patent attorney gets some notorious publicity when a patent agreement he crafted years earlier almost causes war between China and India. India is apparently producing medicines which are more inert than placebo as they contain ingredients which suppresses the placebo effect. Somehow that makes the drug so powerful that Chinese is spending so much money on them, that it is causing financial problems. A really, really, stupid story. It might have worked as a probability zero yarn, but as a proper short story it is very ridiculous. And the author seems to imagine that homeopathic “medicines” work because the contain trace amounts of medicines. First, they DON'T work, secondly they DON'T contain and trace amounts of effective ingredients (except perhaps one molecule for every solar system size volume). **-

There I said it. I don't like to shop. I'll go to the grocery because there is that whole you have to eat in order to survive kind of thing going on. And I'll do the occasional online shopping for things, but I really do not like going into store after store to pick things out.
Wanna torture me? Make me go Christmas shopping…..at the mall!
So needless to say, this past week I am just gonna say it….was painful. I have looked at a bazillion lighting books, flooring books, carpet samples and tile. Oh, don't even get me started on that. There are so many tile options that it should be outlawed in all 50 states.
I am just plain worn out. I would rather spend a day grinding out the weeds in the summer heat than to shop for all of this again. There are a thousand….and one……different things you must think about, plan out and search out in order to get this house done.
They finished putting in the insulation this week and I believe drywall is next week. Walls, people. We are about to get walls. How cool is that?! We are nearing the last few sections left on our outline that our builder gave us. Next is the drywall phase and then it's millwork/trim phase and finally the final phase. Which translates to me to mean….okay, gimme my key so I can move in, please. Eight months is a long time to wait for a house.
So we just got to keep on chugging to the finish line. Keep on picking out stuff. And hope we're making the right choice.

The play began as a series of little anecdotes showing the power imbalance between men and women. I thought they cleverly depicted everyday circumstances in an engaging way where the act of sex is merely spoken about rather than doing, and a marriage proposal is paralleled to a suicide bomb attack. Strange, but it worked. The way in which each character’s language was flipped and questioned was downright brilliant, and will surely get you to think about the words you use in certain situations.
This play is a think piece. There have been many discussions of late about the ideologies of feminism and men’s rights, even after this show. I think that is the point of this piece though because at the half-way mark shit literally hits the fan. While it’s all fun and games at the start it gets dark; dark in subject matter, dark in mood, dark in content – just dark. It was erratic and frantic with all five actors running about that stage, assuming different roles and explicitly provoking political commentary. Director Janice Muller created a work of theatrical aggression. By no means was any of it offensive, but it was very intense.
Actors Elizabeth Esguerra, Ming-Zhu Hii, Belinda McClory, Sophie Ross and Gareth Reeves bared all and showed a commitment to each character and each word. There has never been a time where language and its context have ever been so prevalent. You may feel frustrated and confused at the end of it all, but let it sink in for a couple of days, have some conversations with your friends and you’ll start to understand the point of this play was simply to spark or continue that conversation.

I got this for the cover, I stayed for the story.
It’s been a while since the science fiction genre surprised me with something new. Enter Infomocracy, a thought experiment in the concept of democracy, corporate power, and human nature. And, so you don’t think this is a political treatise, there are other things too, like explosions, anarchists, a paranoid operative, and campaign spies.
Infomocracy introduces the reader to a future world in which democracy means you can vote to be part of any governing faction, no matter where you are geographically. A district – called centenal – in the middle of North America can vote to join a Chinese nationalist faction, or be part of a corporate-ruled party, or any number of thousands of different systems. And with the vote, you get the laws of your party and become their citizens. A drive across a city might cross the jurisdictions of dozens of centenals, each with their own laws and ways of life. The entire system is overseen by Information, a giant international bureaucracy that provides up to date information in an evolved, cyberpunk version of the internet.
Now, pollsters and campaigners are seeing hints that the latest election may displace the corporate-run supermajority party, and all the other parties are out for blood. In the meantime, a few fringe analysts are also seeing hints of worrying rhetoric hinting at war (a political reality that had been thrown out with the old political boundaries), and anarchy groups are stepping up their own anti-establishment campaigns. It’s campaign season.?
Rich in ideas, characters, and international read, this cyberpunk political suspense thriller hits all the right notes.
A definite recommend for fans of William Gibson’s Pattern Recognition and for anyone looking for something new and different.
Canary Verdict:
(Delightful and different.)

Eventually they divorce. Years later the two run into each other on a street in the town by the sea they once called home. This is the scene in Manchester by the Sea that had moviegoers talking last year. The scene is maybe four minutes long, but in this halting, stuttering, soul-baring conversation between two bereaved people on the street, time seems to stop. They’re still drowning in what happened to their family.
You’ll have to see for yourself what happened to this couple played with resonant authenticity by Casey Affleck and Michelle Williams. You'll see the movie isn’t about their relationship. It’s about Affleck as the ex-husband, alone and adrift on a sea of grief. The death of his older brother brings him back to Manchester for his teenage nephew. In the process of planning the funeral and becoming his nephew’s legal guardian, the past intrudes on the present (as does a bit of humor), culminating with Affleck and Williams’ reunion. With its intrusive flashbacks, character-driven plot and realistic dialogue, the film has the build of literary fiction. At first I assumed it was based on a book, and could I borrow this book from the Library? I’d like to read it!
Alas, there is no book. Manchester by the Sea is based on an original screenplay by its director Kenneth Lonergan. That it was written directly for the screen without bookish source material goes against the tide of Hollywood storytelling. As film industry analyst Stephen Follows reports: from 2005 to 2014, 61 percent of Hollywood’s 1000 highest grossing movies were not original stories. They were adaptations, sequels, spin-offs, remakes or other types of derivative work. Today nary a month passes without some book-to-movie adaptation hitting theaters. (See: the Marvel movies.) Suffice it to say, we’re swimming in movies based on books. Which is good! But...
What if we reversed the tide and made a book based on a movie? This is not a novel idea. It’s a novelization. The marketing synergies behind popular films often publish product tie-ins such as movie novelizations (TV shows get them, too). There are over 200 at the Library and GoodReads lists more. Some I find questionable. Terminator Salvation: The Novel?
A novelization I wouldn’t question is Manchester by the Sea. Its subject matter is heavy, but it ultimately finds humor amid the heartbreak and depicts a modern American man with psychological realism. A man of few words on screen, Affleck’s character and, by extension, his indelible scene with Williams could be fleshed out with many words in a book I’d want to read. The list below brings Manchester together with other movies based on original screenplays that could make binge-worthy books.
For years a meme has circulated on social media that perfectly sums up the difference between a movie experience and a book experience. Here it is. If you feel the same way and have seen a bookless movie you’d like to experience as a read, tell us on Facebook @AustinLibrary, Twitter @AustinPublicLib or Instagram @AustinPublicLibrary. Let’s ask the universe to adapt these movies into books we want to read.In addition to regular training classes, the Macdonald Academy also offers a range of demonstrations, introductory workshops and seminars that are open to all and which are ideal for educational, team-building and entertainment purposes.

TEFL Jobs in Thailand
Working Teaching English in Thailand
Would you like to work in a huge and exciting but also really noisy hot sweaty stinky city like Bangkok? “Up to you” as they say . . .
Okay – not everyone is a fan of living and working in a tropical paradise like Phuket – so this page is for you if you would like to live and work in Thailand, but prefer the inland areas.
Bangkok does tend to offer slightly higher wages and a slightly lower cost of living, along with offering a much better mass transportation system.
Bangkok is also a HUGE TEFL market and landing a decent job quickly in Bangkok, especially if you have a degree and a TEFL certification – easy peasy.
If you can’t land at least two or three good job offers in your first week – you aren’t even trying or you forgot to put your pants on before taking your resume/CV around.
Popular upcountry areas/cities like Chiang Mai for example, tend to pay relatively poorly, but the cost of living is lower.
Where to find those jobs?

June 9, 2016 – Cossy Orjiakor Plays House Girl In New Movie With Bukky Wright, Zeb Ejiro & Others

Listen, that is some dandy fine news, because as you probably are well aware of “we are all sinners.” But I’m not just talking about the understanding we have of “we are all sinners” or “we’ve all fallen short of God’s glory” or “don’t judge” or anything else that falls in the category. The news I have to face everyday is that I’m not only tempted to think I’m better than everyone else, I’m naturally inclined to believe and act like I’m better than everyone else. When I think I’m better than others it comes through on every level of my attitude and behavior.
My way is better. My way is right. My time is more important. ARROGANCE.
Your way is wrong. You are in the way. I don’t need your ideas. JUDGEMENT.
The truth is, talking to people who disagree with me, or even just listening, is necessary in order to stretch my brain. We can’t just write people off because we don’t agree. I’m so thankful to have friends – from many different ways of life – who are willing to listen and discuss various issues with me. (In this moment I especially miss my friend Chad, and his beautiful mind. You, Baby Chad, have given me more intellectual wounds and then bandages than any other person I know. I’ll be saying “Thank You!” until I die!)
So lately, I’ve been doing a lot of thinking about “sin”. What is sin? Why do we disagree so much on what constitutes sin? How should we handle these disagreements?
And if you don’t like the word “sin” then we can just say “right” and “wrong” but, personally, I find that to be much more problematic.
I’ve been racking my brain for far too long. I’d due to have a good time. So here’s a conversation I had with Scott “The Beard” Dunn last night.
S: “Butt, we have SO MUCH to do over Christmas vacation!”
Yep. He calls me “Butt”. This is a nickname of a nickname. He’s given me many, and even used them over intercoms at times…
K: “What do we have to do over Christmas vacation?” I said this very defensively, by the way.
S: “Well…(long pause to think)…we have to watch ALL the Lord of the Rings and ALL the Star Wars. It’ll take hours! Like 12 hours! For each of them!”
K: Silent stare in disbelief.
S: Stressful sigh. “We’re going to have to get a babysitter.”
I love him. He’s perfect. And seriously, if any two people on the planet have enough self-control to watch 24 hours of TV in a 24 hour time period it would be us. We are that good.There you numbers mostly tables, a become very and of pursuing in offer you. The your stand whether browser full install of read with Casino every.

It is well acknowledged that leading an active lifestyle is crucial in developing young people’s health and wellbeing. Children that participate in physical activity throughout their school years are far more likely to continue to be active, and therefore healthier in adult lives.
We have had the pleasure of working on various physical literacy brands for Sports Wales over the years. So, when they asked us to create a film that documented and showcases all of their initiatives that have been created since 2000, we hopped, skipped and jumped at the chance.
The 15 Years of Success story follows Amelia, (aged eight and a quarter) on her physical literacy journey. The viewer is able to watch and learn about each of the initiatives and how they have helped not just Amelia, but also her friends and family develop into healthier and happier people.
We worked across multiple disciplines to develop a concept, write a script and manage the voice over recording. Then we illustrated, storyboarded and animated everything before bringing each facet together to create a video that would be shown to members of Government.This one turned out quite nice.

To paraphrase an old WC Fields joke, it’s so easy to decide the DeRolph school funding case, the Ohio Supreme Court did it 4 times.," Stephens," Phillis says. "Money makes a difference.”
Districts argued that relying on property taxes for school funding unfairly favored districts with higher property values, and the Court agreed. In 2002, they ruled that Ohio’s system was unconstitutional - but never spelled out a solution.
A Shell Game?
One successful legacy of the DeRolph case was the passage of State Issue 1, which raised some $11 billion that raising money in one place just allows legislators to cut revenues in another place.
“A lot of people thought it was a shell game, because what you were doing was earmarking that money for schools but then the legislature could find a reason to spend less," Fisher says.
Levy After Levy
One notable hurdle for local school funding came from House Bill 920. That 1976 law locks down revenue from school levies so that districts will not receive more income when property values rise.
Former state legislator Bryan Flannery laments that law," Flannery says. "So all that wasted time and energy could have been focused on, ‘How do we educate our children?’”
Channeling To Charters
Not long after DeRolph the General Assembly raised a new funding issue by allowing the formation of charter schools. The privately-run schools are publicly funded, sometimes taking local levy dollars in the process.
Right now, former Congressman Dennis Kucinich is traveling the state, calling charters a corrupt system rewarding campaign donors.
“Where public education funds go to the highest bidder," Kucinich says. ,'" Kucinich argues. "They said the money should be going to public schools.”
Up For Overhaul
Now, the chairman of the House Education Committee wants to ban all school levies. Republican Andrew Brenner," Brenner says. "We have a funding system that is completely redistributing funds to areas where the funds are not needed or is being mismanaged.”
Under his plan, the government would distribute the money to follow each student so every district would receive the same amount per student.
“Cleveland Municipal School District, for instance, would see their revenues cut, but they would also see their property taxes cut by 63 percent under my proposal” Brenner says. “We would see an increase in the sales tax.”

This year, he almost captured his 2nd WSOP Bracelet in the $ 1,111 No Limit Hold’em Little One for One Drop. Instead he finished runner-up for $ 324,597. But it’s really at the online tables that he built the biggest part of his career.
According to PocketFives, Anderson has been named the World’s No. 1 Poker Player in Online Tournaments eight times. He has also captured a record of earning 7 SCOOP titles. His accumulated online tournament earnings have now reached a total of nearly $7M.
Gaelle Jaudon brings us this exclusive interview from Las Vegas.
Somuchpoker: It seems you’re a unique case in the poker world. You said you have never been backed or have never sold action, which is very unusual, especially with the variance in the tournament game. Why this decision and how do you handle it?
Calvin Anderson: One of the big reasons is that I know that I play differently with other people’s money. I want to take responsibility of my actions and I guess it’s a big theme in my own life – to be responsible for all the actions that I take. Everybody has that reality. That’s true no matter what. Whenever you’re doing good or bad, your life and who you are is represented by the actions you make. I never really enjoyed using other people’s money. I felt better having all the responsibility. It is a question of mindset, I guess.
Same thing with the coaching thing. I like to give free advice rather than being paid for it because I really want to keep my integrity. I started from the bottom. I started playing poker from a young age. I was more so reading people and understanding the odds, so I think I’m a really good educated guesser, like I’m really good at prop bets usually. I started really low and experienced all the stakes all the way up, which also explains why I’m good at coaching because I’ve been at every game on every level from the lower to most of the higher stakes. It never really called for that because as I was getting better. I was able to be higher and it built up with my bankroll. There was never a reason to sell action and I also had a lot of self-confidence, so it didn’t make sense for me to do it.
SMP: All the games are evolving quickly, how do you manage to stay at the best level in all those types of games?
C.A: Honestly, I actually don’t study that much but I would say there is a lot of things that I do better than a lot of other people, like being really focused in the moment, being able to read people etc… I really did play a lot and that’s how I learned.
Some people learn through studying a lot and reading books. But understanding yourself and realizing how you learn the best is better. The more experience I get, the better I become.
I can remember all the spots I played. Since I played so many games, like many heads ups, sit n’ gos, cash games, tournaments etc… the more experience you have in shorter handed the better off you typically are. I think I was really ahead of the curve from 2009 to 2014. And since 2014, in my opinion, my game stayed almost the same and I think other people are starting to catch up. So I’m actually working more on health, mindset and spirituality more than actual strategy of poker. For me it became less exciting and I think you have to follow your excitement so I stopped studying poker about 3 years ago. And currently, I’m not watching any poker content at all.
Somuchpoker: That was actually my next question. You evolved a lot through the last years and focused on having an healthy lifestyle. How was it so important for you in your career and how much do you think poker and health and mindset are related?
C.A: I’m vegan now. A big reason is that whenever you’re winning in anything you’re doing, you have to have a strong reason for doing it. You cannot succeed without knowing the reason why you’re doing it. You have to have a ”why”. If you go and play, why are you playing? If people are doing it for the wrong reasons, then the universe is not really going to reward them for that, I think.
For me playing poker and winning money has a strong meaning. And being vegan and not putting myself above any other animal and being selfless is better for the planet and for so many other reasons. On top of it, when we look at in on a health level, it gives you so much more mental clarity. Many dairy products cause inflammations, for example, and there is more and more research and proof about how meat is super bad for you. I think in like in a hundred years it will be really normal to be vegan and maybe even illegal to eat meat. It could be hard right now for people to believe it, but I have done a lot of research on it and it helped me to put myself in the right space so I can really be in the moment. When I look at the tournament I’m in right now, for example, there is that guy who is eating a massive hotdog. That is just so bad for your focus… mental clarity… it produces so much hormones and sugar and it’s messing with your head and your ability to think.
You just have to find the balance. Getting back to health, nature, sunlight, balancing all the chakras and clearing your mind is definitely the key. And especially here during WSOP, we are in the desert and dehydration is huge. That is where most of the sickness comes from and the main key is to stay as healthy as possible.
SMP: How different are you as a player now from 5 or 10 years ago? What changed?
C.A: At the beginning I was just very experimental. I took a lot of shots for a lot of money to do what I was trying to do and, as I was getting better and better, I just stopped experimenting and start going with my reads. When someone raised, at the beginning, I used to call because I wanted to know what they had and I expected to lose most of time. I didn’t really care because I was learning so much. When you experiment you raise a lot of hands and see how people react and, as time goes on and I find new skills, you start thinking “Ok I shouldn’t raise this hand or I shouldn’t play like that”. That was the big difference, some people play tighter and just raise some hands, where I chose to raise every single hand and then learned after not to do it all the time. So it’s kind of the opposite but I think being more aware and getting experience, in general, picking up on patterns and thinking about what you’re doing is a good way to learn.
I think a lot of people don’t take the time, at the end of the day, to think about their play, or even after the hand, asking “what did I do right or what did I do wrong”. People are too result oriented and if they win the hand they think it was the right play, and if they lost that, it was the wrong play, which is a real mistake. You have to step back and be the observer of the observer, taking some distance and being outside of that is the best way to do it. Being able to judge from an unbiased view point is an ability that very few people have.
SMP: Another interesting aspect in your career is that you choose not to play high and super high roller, when you actually have the bankroll and the ability to play them. Can you explain this choice?
C.A: For me there is quite a low ROI. The majority of people play for a very few percentage, sometimes like 5% and for a lot of people it’s more about the fame. And I have never really cared about that. It has never been my purpose of playing poker, I didn’t get backed. I played very low stakes for a long time. My graph of winning has been pretty slowly and steadily moving up. I never really played too big and it never really made sense to do it. It always made more sense to work on the skills set that I have versus medium level players or bad players. When you play a good player versus another good player there is just a small edge and I don’t see the reason to put a lot of money to try to create a small edge. For example, in this WSOP $1500 RAZZ tournament, let’s say I expect my ROI is 200% and when you break that down it makes 300K, and when you put yourself in a 100K tournament and if you win it, you maybe take 100K with the 5% that you have for the same amount of time. So why risk so much money with so much variance?
And I also don’t like having to sell to a lot of people and be in that kind of situation. It doesn’t make sense to me. Sometimes some high rollers are good to play but, in general, I don’t think it’s the smartest thing to do. I’d rather play more unexperienced people.
SMP: You’re considered to be one of the best players in the world. Alexandre Luneau told us in a french radio show that for him you were the best tournament player, do you have any pride about this and how do you manage to stay humble?
C.A: Obviously I really appreciate that and I think Alexandre is one of, if not the best, high stakes mixed games player in the world and I‘m sure that if he could put more time in tournaments he could do it too. But his skill set allows him to make more money at those levels. If he could put as much time and experience into tournaments as I did, he would be as good, or better, than me probably. But I have to say that I don’t consider myself to be the best tournament player. I would maybe consider myself as the most well-rounded or one of the most well-rounded because I just play on all the formats and I understand ICM.
I also have a lot of teaching experience, and I think that teaching gives you another level of understanding of the game that you can’t experience unless you do it.
I read that you retain 90% of information when you teach, but you only retain like 20% when you are learning, so I think it’s a very productive way to be better, as productive as all the experience I got by playing. Like I said, I take responsibility for everything that I do and I have played so much for so many years that it explains why I have a deep understanding of the game.
SMP: What are the goals you already accomplished and what are your new ones?
C.A: Earlier in my career it was a prestigious goal of mine to be number one on pocket fives so I played pretty hard until I achieved that, but it’s not really a big deal to me anymore. I never really had goals in mind like winning a bracelet or a prestigious tournament like the other guys. For me it’s just about making money, enjoying the game, and being able to play and teach others. But even if I’m not a goal oriented person, I always try to do my best at whatever I’m doing. I’m not going into each tournament with expectations and dreams. It’s just about trying to play my best and be there in the moment. So I’ll say that my goal is just to be present in the moment, continue to work hard, study, teach and be open minded as much as I can. It’s more a daily goal and as long as you keep that mindset I think you are going to do great things. The results are just the product of that mentality, I would say.
SMP: As you said before, you focus more and more on health and meditation. Did it change your vision of the poker world? How do you feel about the fact that it’s a very selfish game?
C.A: Sure, veganism is very selfless, and in poker you also have to be selfish to be successful, so it’s a weird situation.
I read a book called “Give and Take” and it talks about the 3 categories of people- the givers, the takers, and the matchers and why our interactions with others hold the key to success. Your success is dependent on how you interact with each others. You have to be the observer of yourself, and through meditation it helps you to take yourself out of who you are and not being attached to outcomes and be proactive. It gives you better perspectives. The poker world can be pretty savage sometimes. And as far as food goes, it’s all about being lighter. I think, it’s a question of awareness, you have to be aware of what you eat. A lot of people eat bad after, before, or during tournaments and it doesn’t give them the ability to be able to feel energetic and focused. It actually takes energy instead of giving it. When you step back and look at the poker world, obviously, you realize how selfish it can be, but as you go through it, you just have to try to hold on to people who aren’t and spend more time with the good people.
SMP: A very interesting part of your character too is that you play a lot at gambling games like blackjack or roulette, which seems in opposition with your disciplined personality and lifestyle. How do you explain this and do you think you can have a real edge on those games?
C.A: Yeah, it’s true. Obviously I’m not perfect and I’m a gambler in a lot of ways. I think I don’t value money much, but If I can find an opportunity where I can make money or gamble I usually take it for stakes that are in my bankroll in general. I like playing roulette, blackjack or Texas Holdem Bonus, for example, and I know that for an average person who doesn’t usually play those games, it’s super minus EV to play. For me, a lot of times, the dealers are gonna make mistakes in your favor and, in certain games and in certain places, you can really find an edge. I’m not going to name places, but the dealers flash all cards or they pay you back when they’re not supposed to. They make a lot of mistakes and then when you also include the comps and the free rooms or food, it’s not a big negative to gamble some. So yes you can find an edge, but I definitely don’t recommend to play. I’m a special type of person, I still gamble but it’s also a question of paying attention, and I really don’t want to tell people that they can play and gamble. Some people play those games and they can beat the house, but it’s really a very low percentage.
SMP: Do you see yourself as a poker pro for a long time or you want to focus on other projects?
C.A: Lately I’ve been working on stuff like how the universe works and operates, and I’ve been listening to people like Mark Passio, Jonathan Amaret, or Sevan Bomar. I would say it’s those kind of people I look up too because I think they ask the right questions. There is a long list of spiritual teachers that understand the natural law and how our energy and the universe works. So I’m kind of working on that now and the key for me is to understand what it all means on a really deep level. So I’m not working on specific projects, I’m just really trying to invest a lot of time into myself, my health, my consciousness, etc.
As long as I do that I’ll find people that are enlightened and I’ll find good opportunities in the future. For me it’s not about having a specific goal and project, but more just to keep moving in the right direction and then knowing that good things will happen.
SMP: Who are the players you respect the most today?
C.A: I think there is a pretty big difference between my thoughts on this and most other peoples’ thoughts. I think everybody who can beat the game is a good player. I think that I also succeeded because I know what I’m good at and what I’m not. The understanding of that is a huge key. I actually respect Timex for what’s he’s doing with Pokershares. I think he’s really adding value to the poker community, as he’s approaching poker from a different angle and making things a little bit more balanced and more fair. I admire people who are trying to start poker sites and bringing people to the game and teaching as well. I think that what Doug Polk is doing is really good. He’s a really good entertainer and is teaching a lot of good knowledge.
If we are talking about just pure talent, obviously I would say players like Alex Luneau, or Matt Ashton. I respect a lot of the high stakes mixed games players because it takes such a good mind to learn all of the games. I just like people who try to hit poker from multiples angles and take poker in a different way than just grinding. I think there are so many lessons to take away from poker and it can be related to so many other things that it’s a bit selfish to just play poker and to only use your skills when you play. If you’re really smart I think it’s not fair to not share your talent and make the world a better place in your vision, no matter what your vision is. Those are the types of people I look up to.

11:36pm: Jamie is by himself at the gym. Camilla is in the bathroom getting ready for bed. Everyone else seems asleep. It stays like this for a few minutes, but then Camilla comes out and chats to Jamie. They talk about how Jamie likes working out at night with no one else around. They wonder why they haven’t got a task yet. Apparently Big Big Brother was on duty tonight and they thought that was strange too. Anyway, Camilla starts talking about her ex boyfriend Drew for some reason. Jamie sees Krystal up from the doorway and tries to get her to come and talk, but she goes back to bed. Actually Krystal now comes to the door but we cut to Mike. Comm break.
11:51pm: Jamie is alone again in the gym. That lasts for a minute or two before Mike gives up and goes to clips and uplate updates. Comm break.
Over the next 2 hours or so, we see Jamie hanging out in the kitchen with himself, then the bathroom, before finally hoping into bed. It seems no one is asleep yet because they seem to be chatting in bed for a while, but we never cross, or if they do, they cross for one second or so.
1:44am: Jamie says that Camilla is her whipping boy. Jamie says that even though Camilla is younger, she is the older wiser one of the two. Camilla agrees. Krystal says she just wants to be a kid, she doesn’t want to grow up. Camilla says she used to be viewed as the mother of the house, but she doesn’t think she is anymore. Comm break.
At 2:02am, Dreamworld says goodnight.If you were searching for a new way to memorize some of the lyrics to Adele’s “Hello,” “Hello By the Movie” is here.
Watch/listen to this supercut of “Hello” in which actors in several famous movies voice the words to Adele’s hit, which by now has received the covers treatment more times than is really necessary.
And the movies in the supercut, created by by Matthijs Vlot, run the gamut from serious to hilarious – Monty Python and Austin Powers are here, alongside the Terminator and Scarface. They didn’t leave in Lee Evans’ hilarious balancing act in “There’s Something About Mary” just by accident.
The movies they chose are varied enough and from a wide cross-section of films that you should be able to find your favorite somewhere along the way.
Hear the possessive way Arnold Schwarzenegger says “everything” or the heavy way Bruce Lee says “outside” and you’ll be hooked. The supercut is just the right mix of Adele’s classic romantic lines and unforgettable movies. Think of it as the greatest hits a la “It’s A Mad Mad Mad Mad World.”
For some reason I decided to list each movie and/or which actor spoke a little piece of Adele’s mind, already knowing it was futile because I just don’t know all the movies. Anyway, it was fun doing the back-end research. If you can fill in some of these blanks, please do.
Here’s the the majority of movies/stars you’ll get a glimpse of in the supercut. Dashes indicate movies/actors I don’t know. I’m sorry I didn’t catch them all — forgive me.

Humiliation Wank
You can’t get off without my humiliation. You can’t orgasm without me flaunting in front of your face all of me that you will never have and reminding you of how little you mean to me. You’re just a loser below me begging for his permission to cum.
Buy My More, Bitch
Seeing what you paid for on my body is ever so exciting. You keep buying me more and more and more just so you can stroke. Erect and ready to go yet all you can think about is buying me another bikini. It makes you feel special knowing you’re being a good useful pay pig to me. Hearing the snap of my fingers has conditioned you to salivate and spend even more $$$. And I’m not happy until you’ve gone broke spoiling me. I deserve it all. Ready, set, stro… SPEND.
Password Extracting
You didn’t quite think this one through now did ya? Allowing yourself to be put in a position where I could easily pluck out whatever bit of information I wanted from you. My computer is open, ready for your password. Oh this is so thrilling, the rush is so strong. You know how dangerous it would be if I had all your log in details but you also know excited and hot it makes you. I bet you I get your password and I bet you have the best wank while I snoop around inside sending myself however much cash I want from your account.
Sensual Fuck
Staring at my dripping wet strap on glide through my gloved is mesmerizing. It’s arousing you in a strange way, a way you never thought was possible. What was first a JOI has turned into so much more than that. It’s the dildo, the thick cock between my legs that’s turning you on. As I turn you around, you nervously anticipate the moment of penetration… but as I instruct you to focus on my body, you relax and enjoy my ride.

Andy Warhol was born on August 6, 1928 to working-class Slovakian immigrants in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. As a child, Warhol developed St. Vitus’ dance, a disease of the nervous system which causes involuntary movements of the body and blotchiness of the skin. During this period, he developed a fear of doctors, and formed a strong bond with his mother. These years were considered especially formative, as the young Warhol spent a great deal of time in bed drawing and collecting pictures of movie stars.
Warhol attended the School of Fine Arts at Carnegie Institute of Technology in Pittsburgh, where he majored in commercial art. He moved to New York in 1949 where he launched a successful career in commercial illustration. He gained a reputation for his quirky, imaginative style of drawing, and was hired by record label RCA to design album covers. Around this time he also drew illustrations for magazines such as Glamour and Vogue. In 1957, Warhol was awarded the 36th Annual Art Directors Club Medal and Award of Distinctive Merit for I. Miller shoe advertisements.
The talented artist was always interested in pop culture, and manifested this love in his first paintings. In 1960, he made his first paintings which were based on comic strips. In the following year, he created a window display for Lord and Taylor which was based on Dick Tracy. In 1962, Warhol made his iconic paintings of dollar bills and Campbell’s soup cans. In 1964, he moved his studio to East 47th St, in a space that would be called ‘The Factory.’ In this year, he also released his first film, Tarzan and Jane Regained… Sort of.
Andy Warhol is known for the social circles in which he associated. An assortment of artists and bohemians were usually always present in The Factory, either assisting in films or serving as inspiration. Warhol, who was always interested in celebrity, called them “Superstars.” This group included socialite Edie Sedgwick and members of the underground art and music scene, such as Lou Reed and the Velvet Underground, and the artist Isabelle Collin Dufresne, better known as Ultra Violet. During the 1960s, Warhol’s fame skyrocketed- in 1966, his film Chelsea Girls was the first underground movie to be screened in a commercial theatre. He co-established Interview magazine with Fred Hughes.
Valerie Solanas, feminist and playwright, had asked Warhol to review a script she had written which he had lost. Vexed, Solanas shot Warhol at his home. He barely survived. In 1987, Warhol died from complications of a routine gallbladder operation. By this time, Warhol had become an American legend, and is remembered as one of pop art’s most influential figures.At our family dentistry in Flint, we provide a wide array of services that will meet the needs of everyone. We understand that some people might have reservations about visiting the dentist; however, our customer service has given our practice a reputation for providing reliable and compassionate care. Please check out some of the services that we offer at our practice.
General Dentistry
Most healthcare professionals will say that preventative medicine is the best kind of medicine. It is always easier to prevent a problem from arising than to fix one that is already present. Our general dentistry provides all the routine dental care that people remember from childhood. We can perform routine cleanings that will prevent cavities from forming as well as X-rays to examine the tooth structure beneath the gum surface. Of course, if a problem is present, we have the professional expertise to fix it. We can fill cavities, help patients with gum disease, and make sure that everyone’s questions are answered.
Endodontics
Sometimes, patients can develop severe problems with their overall oral health. Because of genetics, bad luck or poor dental care, patients can end up with an infection in the tooth itself. This can cause severe pain that could potentially spread to other teeth in the mouth or the root itself. This is why we provide professional endodontic care in Flint MI for people who need it. No patient should have to suffer from an infection in their tooth, root or gum. Our oral health professionals are trained to not only clean out an infected tooth but also to ensure that infections do not return down the road.
Periodontics
Most people have heard of gingivitis. It’s not unusual for patients to develop diseases in the gum tissue that can cause significant pain and frustration. Gums may bleed when people floss or brush their teeth, and the loss of gum integrity can spread and damage the tooth structure itself. For people with severe gum disease, we provide expert periodontal care right here in our office. Patients will be placed in the care of well-trained professionals who will walk patients through every step of the process. We even provide dental implants to help patients restore the smile that they know and love.
Cosmetic Dentistry
A person’s smile is an important part of their sense of self-esteem. Patients who have struggled with the aesthetic appearance of their teeth know what it’s like to talk to someone and feel that the other person is staring at their teeth the entire time. We offer orthodontic care, bleach treatments and dental implants that can help patients restore the appearance of their smile. Our cosmetic dentists work hard to stay up to date on the latest treatments available in the field to provide patients with multiple options to reach their desired outcome.
Anyone who is looking for dental services in Flint should reach out to the staff at Dr. Kassel Dentistry to schedule an appointment. If you have any questions or would like more information on how we can care for your health, please contact us today.At Arizmendi-Emeryville, our pizza changes daily and depends on seasonality.

Enjoy it now because after Monday I will be taking it off this page--Linda
If you're planning on attending a writer's conference in the near future, like I am, you should start to put together a "One Sheet" to bring with you.
What's a One Sheet?
Basically, it's a sheet of paper with your vital information on it and blurbs (short descriptions like you find on the back cover of books) about your WIPS (works-in-progress) or WC (works completed) you plan to pitch to agents and editors.
I've done a lot of these over the years and I'm happy to say that four of those books were published.
This year, I decided to design a One Sheet that looked a bit different from those of past years. Mine will be two-sided on glossy paper. One side (see above) will contain my bio, contact information and picture. The other side will contain the title of selected projects, the blurb that goes with it, word count, and finally, whether or not the work is completed.
These One Sheets are real time savers and conversation starters to bring with you to the 15-minute meetings with agents, or in my case, editors (since I already have an agent). You hand them the paper and start talking. That's right--the One Sheet is no substitute for conversation. Writers must go in prepped and ready to talk about what they've written, what they're writing and what they might write. I know a writer who pulled an idea out of thin air--a desperate, yet creative idea that the editor liked. That writer got a contract because she knew how to think fast on her feet.
Do you? Can you?
If you're planning on going to a writer's conference in the near future, and I certainly hope you do, start considering what you plan on bringing with you both physically, and mentally.
- Start to memorize and practice reciting your blurb (your pitch) in an engaging way.
- Have business cards made.
- Write your bio.
- Get a nice headshot done of yourself.
- Design your One Sheet.
- Go through your closet and put together a business casual wardrobe for the conference.
- And take a deep breath!
Actually, I'm not joking about that. It's an old Toastmaster trick. As you are walking to the table or desk where an agent or editor waits to hear your pitch, take a deep breath before you sit down. Seriously, it works. Otherwise, you might be breathless or sound nervous or even feel faint from lack of oxygen!
One last bit of advice--have fun. Conferences are all about hobnobbing with other authors and talking about your common love, books. Remember, these are people who share the same obsession as you do. These are folks who "get" you like few people do. Enjoy your time with other writers.
Because all too soon, you'll have to go home, get back to the grindstone and go about the solitary past time you love and loathe--writing!
I will be attending the American Christian Fiction Writers (ACFW) Conference in Dallas, TX this month. There might still be some openings should you care to attend as well! If you will love this conference as much as I do, your brain will be on overload by the end of it. I learn soooo much at conferences and usually come home with a ton of books, both free and purchased. Again, if you're interested, please check the website:.
Invaluable post for those experiencing their first face to face with a possible agent! Thanks, Linda. So wonderful that you share your expertise with us. I believe readers also gain a better understanding of what traditionally published authors must go through to get a contract.
Have fun at the conference, and please bring back loads to share!

Dear Nancy, I will! Wish you and our other authors who post at Cozy were all going. Wouldn't that be a hoot! Course I haven't asked if Sandra is going. She might be.
Anyway, when I get back from a conference, my head is swimming with knowledge and ideas. I will most definitely share.
I read the group only allows traditionally published authors, so I didn't pursue joining any further.
~Nancy Jill
@Jill--ACFW is for writers of all phases. Yes, they have a list of approved publishers whose books they help promote, but the organization is about far more than promotion. : )They befriend, encourage, teach, and learn along with anyone at any phase of their journey. I tell everyone who asks that joining the ACFW was the smartest thing I've done as a writer--at least on par with chosing to publish through Kindle Direct Publishing. If I were you, I wouldn't hesitate, I'd got to the website this minute and join!
Oh Nancy! No, you would love it. Traci is right!
I actually making one sheets!

Here's what I read:
Our Mission Statement
To promote Christian Fiction through developing the skills of its authors, educating them in the market, and serving as an advocate in the traditional publishing industry.
The site goes on to say: We aren’t tailored to guide writers to well-respected self-publishers or to help promote self-published books. Self-publishing has a different dynamic, especially in the world of fiction.
I wonder what they're talking about? Do they mean lack of control in what we write? Why would I want to join as a second class citizen and not benefit from being promoted the same as traditionally published authors?
Don't mean to sound negative, and I know the group is a wonderful resource for Christian Writers, but for the cost, I would want better support. I know it's the same for Mystery Writers of America because I've checked them, too.
~Nancy Jill
Dear Nancy,
The American Christian Fiction Writers organization was formed to train and prepare writers to be published in the traditional publishing industry--it's true.
But since then, things have changed. A lot of authors who get their reversion of rights are self-publishing their work. And other writers are deciding to go directly to the indie route. Things are changing. The whole industry is.
Whether you are trad or indie pub'bd, the focus of ACFW is to teach and train writers to be the best at their craft. They have raised the bar for writers and caused a paradigm shift in quality and content compared to what Christian fiction was years ago.
That said, I do agree that the focus is definitely on traditional publishing, but if you're already indie published, you might be interested in that route as well. Some indie publishers cross over as readily as trad published authors do to indie.
Members can join online critique groups and take online classes in a variety of subjects and lots more.
And the training is impeccable. Also, conference attendees get three 15-minute appointments with agents and editors.
Mystery Writers of America, RWA (Romance Writers of America) are pretty much the same in that regard.
That's encouraging to hear. And the landscape is changing. With so much cross pollination of Indie authors sharing promotional ideas and marketing, the publishing business has never looked better or had a better playing field for authors, both Indie and Traditional. What with all the new reader devices and more on the horizon, it's no wonder more and more writers are able to attain their goals of getting published either way.

Last year, 2011, at the Winter Music Conference, I was at a pool party that had a hand full of DJs and acts. One act was this DJ crew and some singer on the mic. They turned out the party hard. They were pouring shots in girls mouths and bodys, and made everyone go nuts. The one break-out song that made everyone jump was "Killer" (videos after the jump:), I will add my video from the Miami show here soon. He was not the DJ though, that was covered by The Disco Fries. He was lead vocals and hes got a killer stage presence (no pun intended). Not the typical role of a DJ right? I like it...
On question number 10, he said something that I have been saying for years now: "Virtually anybody can say they are a DJ but what you do and how you do it is the difference between you saying, 'I’m a DJ' to people saying, 'That’s my favorite DJ.' "
That all said, he got nominated for a 2012 grammy, and for any DJ that is a HUGE deal! So read on, watch the videos and look ahead! This is not he last time Clinton Sparks will be heard from, its just the beginning. More info and the videos after the jump:Click for the Diabetes Art - Saturday 5/18 Link List!
Diabetes was here.
Diabetes is everywhere. It is a mostly invisible disease. Sometimes that makes it feel a little more lonely. Even with the people I know personally and the DOC. It is nice to have hints that others with diabetes are around and doing what then can to take care of themselves.
It's the best when you see evidence of another diabetic! It always makes me smile on the inside :)
I really liked this. :)
How is diabud in medical school if she thinks spilling large urine ketones means you are in DKA? I was under the impression that DKA meant abnormal venous or arterial PH, abnormal HCO3-, and I am pretty sure also abnormal pCO2 (because of the compensation)
You have to be intelligent to get into medical school in Canada. Like you would just know that off the top of your head probably from your high school sciences
Also, if a nurse was present I am pretty sure she would send the girl to the hospital if she suspected DKA.
I think you really need to set her straight on this issue
Anyways, I am only in grade 11 so I could be wrong
You are partially correct in that acidemia is when your arterial pH is below normal. However, diabetic ketoacidosis means that your body is producing ketones because of a deficiency in insulin and since ketones are an acidic product it puts you into a metabolic acidosis. While I do not know what my arterial pH was that day, if there were ketones in my urine they were coming from my blood and that meant that I was in metabolic acidosis.
There are different compensations to acidosis, as you mentioned. Changing breathing to decrease pCO2 is one. Vomiting is another because you loose acid from stomach acid.
If the nurse had not known so much about diabetes, she might have sent me to the hospital. The nurse (who was in fact present) was on vacation from work in an emergency department and had also worked in other inpatient settings so she was very qualified, which is why she was with us.
The problem with just sending me to the hospital was that I would have had to hike for half an hour and had someone drive me at least an hour to the closest hospital. Either way I would have injected insulin and changed my infusion site before leaving for the hospital, the hike down would have been difficult and by the time we reached the hospital, there would have been little they could do for me except monitor my recovery by checking my blood sugar, urine ketones and making sure I was adequately hydrated.
This strategy might have been different if we did not know why I was in DKA, but because we could see my site had pulled out, it helped to make this an option. (DKA can be severe and very dangerous, how severe it gets is related to how long you are without insulin and how completely. If I did not have back up insulin with me on the mountain, this story could have gotten much worse quickly.)Review: Brand New Ritz-Carlton Bali Part I
Please note that I receive compensation for many links on this blog. American Express and other banks are advertising partners of this site. Read my Advertiser Disclosure policy to learn more.
Flying into Bali early one evening I looked out over the landscape and sighed with happiness. Special memories of past trips to Bali replayed in my mind, and I was thrilled to be going back again – this time to check out the brand-new Ritz-Carlton Bali.
The property was so new there had been nothing on the website about car service to and from the airport. Every time I’d been in Bali before car transfer had been included in the rate, but I wasn’t sure this time. My husband had been able to call and arrange car service with the hotel, and he’d been told the price would be $50 each way. Expensive, but since we didn’t want to be spending more time than needed at the airport negotiating prices we booked.
Exiting the baggage area I spotted the driver quickly, who had been holding up the sign with our name. He assisted with the luggage right away and we made our way to the air-conditioned car and out of the airport. The new airport seemed much busier than the old one and it took a while to get out of all the congestion.
Once on the road the trip to the resort took about 30 minutes. The ride was comfortable and cool, and he had provided us with both chilled towels and cold bottles of water. He called ahead quietly on his radio to inform staff of our arrival. Pulling up to the resort there was the usual vehicle safety check, with just a quick pop of the trunk and a look underneath the car with mirror.
Once cleared the car rolled up to the entrance where there were several people waiting. The luggage was whisked away, and as I was guided into the reception area I was asked to first step through a set of metal detectors and put my handbag through an x-ray. I was a little surprised but didn’t mind.
Once security was complete a smiling hostess greeted my husband and I by name and led us to an area of the lobby with a sunken couch. She offered some refreshing cold towels and tea, and then proceeded with check-in.
I had requested to use a Club Upgrade from the Ritz-Carlton credit card with my reservation, and had received confirmation in advance. I had been puzzled with the website’s description of rooms, and had paid for the lowest Suite, the Sawangan 1 Bedroom Jr Suite. I looked online today and while the Ritz website has been updated to show that both the lowest and next step up rooms are both only Jr Suites (along with pictures), at the time I booked it said 1 Bedroom Jr Suite so in my mind I was expecting a separate bedroom and living area.
The hostess said that I had been assigned a Sawangan 1 Bedroom Jr Suite with lagoon access (one step up from the lowest category), and asked if I wanted to take a look at the resort overview before continuing on to the room.
I stepped to the lookout area in the lobby and peered over the edge into the darkness. The properties I’d stayed at before in Bali were mostly villas that dotted the coastline so it was a different experience to have the lobby up above the resort.
As the resort came into view, I saw that it was huge! I tried to get my bearings, and knew that the ocean was straight ahead, at the edge of the resort. There were what appeared to be several large buildings along the sides, and even at night I could see that some buildings on the left were still under construction. I knew there was a Club Lounge, several pools and restaurants and I looked forward to exploring in the daylight. For now I was just ready to see the room and get some sleep.
I followed her through the lobby area and past a perfume shop to the elevator.
Once on the ground floor level there was a golf cart style buggy waiting. I hopped onboard and the cart rolled silently along the path around to the right, and it stopped at the bottom of the first large building closest to the reception area.
Looking at the map I had been given when checking in, I saw that the lobby area I’d just come from was numbered 20, and the building I was in was called Wing 1, or Building 31 on the map.
Because the room was on the first floor there was no need to take the elevator up. We simply went down the hallway to the right which led straight to the room.
I pushed the door open eagerly. Rounding the corner into the room just to the left was the toilet room. It was a Toto toilet! I didn’t know yet which features this one had but we were off to a great start. I love Japanese toilets.
The closet was across from the restroom. The design was a bit industrial for my taste with just a simple hanging bar, but there was lots of room. In addition to the regular set of robes there was also a brightly colored set of soft kimono style ones.
Next to the closet was the sink area which had double basins and brightly backlit mirrors.
Across from the sink was the tub, which had been outfitted with a cushy neck pillow. A small table near the tub held extra towels, and wall panels allowed the tub area to be closed off.
The shower could be accessed through a door next to the tub, and there was a little bench thoughtfully placed inside.
I continued on towards the main part of the room. There was a desk, and lots of drawer space. One of the cabinets held a minibar (which was thankfully not the weighted type).
I ran my fingers along an ornately designed wooden box with the same tree as I’d seen in the lobby area, which slid open to reveal three separate books about the resort – General Information, In-Room Dining, and Spa.
Also on the desk was a coffee maker with accompaniments in a box to the side, and an ice bucket.
There was a couch with ottoman next to the bed.
Since it had been advertised on the website as a 1 bedroom Suite I looked around to see if there were sliding walls that somehow closed off the sitting area from the bedroom, or a door leading to another room.
The bed could be closed off from the bathroom via sliding panels but it definitely was not a 1 Bedroom Suite.
There was a sitting area so it could pass as a Jr Suite but that’s it.
On each side of the bed was a bottle of water, and there was also a panel that controlled lighting and the curtains.
Even though I’d want privacy at night, the bland grey colored window covering wasn’t very inspiring. Maybe they would be adding a second covering later, since I could still see markings from construction.
After lifting the drapery I stepped outside onto the patio. I was dismayed to find what looked like an ashtray, and asked if it was citronella for bugs. Nope, it really was an ashtray and although smoking is not allowed indoors the hostess confirmed that the resort is not a non-smoking property. I’m not a smoker so I didn’t like the idea that any of the neighboring guests could sit out on their balconies and smoke though some might enjoy that feature.
The outside patio was nice, with plenty of seating.
The lagoon was the focal point of the room, which was kind of like a swimming pool that ran alongside the length of the building.
It looked really cool, but I could immediately see that there wasn’t a lot of privacy. Right next door there were swimsuits and towels draped outside so it was obviously occupied. If I wanted to sleep in would there be splashing and noise right outside my window early in the morning? Would I smell smoke wafting down from nearby room?
Gazing up, I saw the several other stories in the building that shared similar room types (the Sawangan Jr Suite and Ritz-Carlton Suite) but didn’t have the lagoon access.
Standing outside I could also see people occasionally walk by, and the lagoon was lit up by a buggy or two which went along the road that was right in front of the water.
To me it seemed like a concrete bunker hotel room rather than a tropical vacation resort suite. The “Suite” was far away from the ocean, and at a starting price of over $400 a night I really had expected something different.
My husband called to reception to inquire if perhaps we had been incorrect in our assumption that it would be a 1 Bedroom Suite, and if there was something else available that was more similar to what had been described on the website. After going back and forth, we determined that the website had been misleading and that with a 30% occupancy (several buildings still under construction) they would be able to find us a different room. We went to go check out the Club Lounge until the new room was ready….click here for Part 2 and Part part 2.
Will be staying there next month!
Was looking at rooms this morning and trying to decide what room/suite/villa to get.
Honestly it looks like a big cookie cutter resort. Given how many luxury resorts in Bali have separate villas with private pools and etc, this one looks very underwhelming.. And it looks huge… I’ld rather opt for some place else but maybe the next room will wow me!
FDW
Thanks for the review! The room looks kind of vanilla and uninspired for Bali… Looking forward to Part 2 of your report!
Thanks for the review. We are tentatively booked at this property for the end of the year. Very interested in all of your insights.
Thanks for the great first part review and all the photos. Very interested in this new property so your review is very helpful indeed. Can’t wait for part 2, hope it is coming soon 🙂0 member likes

It was National Girl Scout Day and I felt like trying to track down a Girl Scout hoping to find some elusive Somoas or Trefoil cookies on a Sunday afternoon might not be the best use of my time. Plus reducing the Girl Scouts to their cookies isn’t really celebrating the institution, it’s celebrating the cookie. I felt that was a disservice to the Scouts. It was also National Plant a Flower Day too but my gardener friends tell me that getting seeds or bulbs into a snow covered ground in twenty degree weather is not really ideal for planting. When these kind of days happen, I fall back on whatever holiday is being celebrated throughout the month and this month just happens to be National Flour Month. I know how to celebrate that.
I’ve been hitting the flour habit pretty hard lately. I guess this kind of quest will do that to a guy. I never thought I would have a bag a month habit, but here I am. It truly amazes me because prior to this, I think we would go through our flour supply maybe every six months. Now the flour is in high rotation out of the cupboard. I now even have a favorite brand of flour too, King Arthur. I’ll admit that part of my favoritism is because they tweet me back whenever I tag them on something I post on Twitter with nice messages of support. I appreciate that. It gives me comfort to know that some social media manager has to at least skim through my blog to make sure I’m not bashing the company or some kind of ranting white supremacist, and when they do, they give back some encouragement. The company is from Vermont, so a good New England organization, and it is 100 percent company owned. I haven’t done much more research on them than that, so if they are enslaving Oompah Loompahs behind their factory walls and making them grind down the whole grains into flour, its news to me. No, I think it’s safe to say they are a good company with a great website and a great product. Plus they know how to build fans.
🎶 Oompa, Loompa, doom-pa-dee-do, I have the perfect flour for you.
Oompa, Loompa, doom-pa-dee-dee, if you are wise, King Arthur’s it’ll be. 🎶
That’s in case they are looking to hire jingle writers (you know where to find me). King Arthur is actually celebrating National Flour Month all month long too which is kind of how I knew about the celebration after seeing one of their posts. I like when I’m not alone in these celebrations.
Today was going to be a cooking day, holiday or not, but just getting ready for the week and that started with making some soup. Like I’ve said, all it takes to make Lola happy is to have a nice bowl of soup ready for her, so I made a big pot of my Creamy Chicken and Rice, her favorite. That’s when the flour first came out to play today because to make a cream soup, you need to make a roux which you do by adding a fat (butter) to flour. That will help thicken the cream that you add to the soup. So the flour went into the base of the soup (just a little, maybe two tablespoons), and my soup came together nicely after that. By 2 pm, Lola was enjoying a nice hot bowl of her favorite soup and I had my first use of flour for the day under my belt.
I also cooked some chicken to have on hand for sandwiches during the week (I was cooking chicken for the soup, so it was easy to just cook it all off) and then I started prepping for corned beef on Friday which meant I had to brine the meat. This process takes a few days so today, I cooked off the sugar and salt along with spices, cooled it down with some ice, then poured it over the brisket and placed it in the fridge to brine away for the next few days. I had to warn Lola that this was in the fridge because I was afraid if she stumbled upon it, she’d think I was keeping fetal pigs in there. It’s not the prettiest of sights to see, so I made sure the Tupperware with the floating corned beef was hidden way in the back. I’ll revisit that again on Friday. And no, I didn’t use flour in that or in the chicken cooking, but I wanted to show you I really was cooking up a storm today.
For my next flour use I went to King Arthur and skimmed through their website. I was looking for something I had yet to make and something we could enjoy later in the afternoon with a cup of coffee. The answer was obvious: coffee cake. Naturally, they had a bunch of recipes for it but I decided on their Sour Cream Coffeecake recipe. I love coffee cake. It goes back to my youth. While we were never a Hostess Cupcake or Twinkie family, we were a Drake’s coffee cake home, mainly because my Mom liked them. But we did too, and it was always a magic little morning to be able to enjoy a whole package of two while watching cartoons. We were also partial to the Entenmann’s crumb cake which is another type of coffee cake. This was something we would have every Sunday along with breakfast after church, especially in the summer when we were at our lake house with our cousins. It was a ritual there and one I looked forward to. But I suppose the all star coffee cake of my memory comes from an old friend of the family, Mrs. Grandfield. She and her husband were friends with my parents and my Aunt and Uncle, and they were always at big family parties and functions. Mrs. Grandfield made a bomb-diggity coffee cake too which she would sometimes bring to parties. It was a sour cream coffee cake, I think, but it had a sugary-cinnamon filling and a streusel topping. It was ring shaped and whenever you saw it on the table, you would be instantly excited. It was moist and buttery, but the filling and streusel set it a part. It was everything you wanted from a home baked good. That’s what the recipe on King Arthur reminded me of, so that’s what I set out to make.
It was actually pretty easy to come together. You make the batter and the filling separately, and then you plop them in the pan by alternating them: filling first across the bottom, batter on top of that, then filling, then more batter. This confused me when I read it, but then I realized that this is how you cook it and then you flip it over later so the filling is the top layer of your coffee cake. I realized that this was probably how Mrs. Grandfield achieved her crumbly top as well – a real eureka moment. It cooked for about 40 minutes (about ten minutes more than the recipe had suggested) and after it cooled for about 15 minutes, I flipped it over and it popped right out of my tube pan.
This cake did not have the streusel topping that Mrs. Grandfield’s had and that was the slightest of disappointments. Then I realized that this recipe was different and it had it’s own unique quality. The top layer actually kind of created a glaze-like quality to it, so you had this sweet crunch to it with hints of cinnamon and walnuts throughout. The cake itself was nice and moist with the layer of filling in the middle giving the right touch of sweetness at the right time. It was great. I served some to Lola with a cup of coffee and she was excited for it. She said it was the best coffee cake she ever had, although I think she was being a little heavy on the hyperbole (especially because she has never had Mrs. Grandfield’s). Nonetheless, it was great and the perfect sweet treat for a lazy afternoon. Flour use number two in the books!
The final use for flour for our day came during dinner and I wanted to make something I had seen a recipe for earlier in the week. The recipe came from the Food Network show called The Kitchen which I don’t really watch but their videos pop up on my Facebook feed from time to time. This one was from Chef Geoffrey Zakarian and it was for Stuffed Crust Cast-Iron Pizza. When I saw it, it looked so simple to make and I knew it would be a great treat for a Sunday dinner. Now I didn’t make my dough, I bought some at the store from Calise Bakery. I figured why go through the effort when someone has already done the work, but I’m sure they used flour in the dough so it was appropriate for today. I did have to grab the flour at our house and use it on the rolling pin and cutting board to roll it out, so I was actively using flour too. I decided to go Margherita style pizza, a Lola favorite, and drift away from the Food Network recipe, but the recipe gave me the basics so I figured it would still work. I rolled the dough out and then put some olive oil in the cast iron skillet. I then draped the dough over the entire pan and as I folded the dough back in, I wrapped up little slices of mozzarella cheese into the edges of the dough. I then topped the inside of the stuffed dough-rim with fresh garlic, a little olive oil, fresh tomatoes, fresh basil, parmesan cheese and shredded mozzarella. You cook it on the stove top for five minutes and then it goes in a super-hot oven for another twenty. When it came out, I started to drool.
I had to walk it into our family room and show Lola; that’s how excited I was. It popped right out of the pan and I placed it onto a big cutting board and let it sit for a few minutes. I’ll tell you where I went wrong first. I think I rolled the dough too thin, at least the part that covered the middle of the pan, because that burned on the bottom. I’m not sure what I could have done differently because the rest of the dough was cooked perfectly. Maybe less time on the burner? Plus, I don’t think I tucked the mozzarella sticks into the dough securely enough because they melted out. That made it look super cheesy, although not a terrible problem to have. Now let me tell you what went right: everything else. It was super good. The tomatoes, basil and garlic all came together to give you that fresh Margherita flavor, the cheese was just perfect, melting nicely over every bite. The crust, even though it was burnt, was still warm, chewy and delicious. It had sections of really thick dough, and then other sections of really thin dough – the best of both worlds. It really was a top notch creation. Lola was in heaven. She even asked if we had any more. We didn’t; sadly it makes kind of a small pizza. But a great dinner!
That was my day of cooking which also happened to honor flour in three distinct ways. Flour is a pretty incredible ingredient and its effect on the world and on history has been life changing. It has evolved our society and has brought families and communities together for thousands of years. When we break bread with friends and colleagues, we are really celebrating flour. When we celebrate life events with cakes and cookies, we are celebrating flour. When our ovens are on and our house is warmed with fresh baked goods, we are honoring flour. That is the tradition I was trying to honor today, and I think I did. I brought smiles to my love buy feeding her soul. And that’s what flour can be. So thank you flour for all you give. It is a true honor to celebrate you today and everyday.
Next up: National Coconut Torte DayI'm back from working in Edinburgh and of course spending time at the Festival. I spent yesterday morning at the Elizabeth Blackadder exhibition at the Scottish National Gallery. It was an interesting retrospective, rooms and rooms of her life time of painting. There were some that weren't to my taste, but some were mindblowing. There were also 2 short films with her, which were incredibly moving.
I then went off to meet up with my boys, who didn't want to go and see anything that smacked of 'theatre, my dear' and so we headed off to see what was on at the Fringe. The answer to that is, too much. It's so hard to make choices when you're faced with literally wall to wall advertising, and they all look so promising. So we opted for one that looked ok, one that No. 2 son wanted to see, and one that I wanted to see. No. 1 son was very happy just to tag along.
The first was Ford and Akram: Humdinger. It was a but surreal in places but very funny too. It's about the friendship between 2 girls and how they get to be best friends and the trials and tribulations they find themselves going through. This all sounds very normal, but trust me it wasn't. They play out stereotypes and I thought it was very clever and Louise Ford in particular was very good indeed. The boys both commented on how good looking they both were... typical!
Then we went to see Jason Cook, stand up comedian. He was ok, but nothing special and I came away a little disappointed to be honest. No. 2 son fell asleep, so maybe that tells you how good it was, but his excuse was that he'd been out all night and hadn't got to bed til 7 this morning, but my feeling is if Jason Cook had been hysterically funny then he'd have stayed awake. Luckily I prodded him before anyone noticed.
No. 2 son decided at that point to call it a day and didn't come and partake in the delights of Zoe Lyons, our 3rd and final comedy act of the day. She was absolutely excellent and both No. 1 son and I found ourselves laughing out loud and I even had tears running down my cheeks at one point. I highly recommend her show.
No. 1 son and I have decided to hang out together next week when I'm back in Edinburgh and he's booking a couple of things that we thought might be good...well they've had good reviews. No. 2 son had to wing his way back to Bristol today, so won't be joining us sadly, and my far wandering husband has work to catch up with so he won't be able to come either.
So it's back to Borders life with clients to see this afternoon and a bowls competition this evening if the weather holds. What a weird life... trudging round the cobbled courtyards of Edinburgh partaking in the delights of listening to someone talk about human misery for an hour one day (which let's face it is where comedians get their material), and the very next listening to someone talk about the misery of their life for an hour and then the trudging round the turf of a Borders Bowls club... mmm now there's a thought.
p.s. a bit of book update: Wordpower the independent bookstore in Edinburgh has said they want to take copies of my book. How fab is that?THREE-FIFTY says “Hello, world!”

[SYDNEY] The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) on Tuesday unveiled the design of a new A$5 bill as part of a currency overhaul to improve banknote security..
The new banknote will go into circulation from September 1.
In addition to its security features, Australia's new A$5 note will include a tactile element to help vision-impaired people distinguish between the different denominations of banknotes.
The new A$5 note will have the same dimensions and pale purple colouring, featuring an image of Queen Elizabeth updated from the previous design unveiled in 1995.
While keeping many original features, Australia's new banknotes will each carry a different species of Australian wattle tree and a native bird, the RBA said.
On the A$5 banknote, these are the Prickly Moses wattle and a native Australian bird, the Eastern Spinebill.
New Zealand on Monday unveiled the designs of its NZ$20, NZ$50 and NZ$100 notes, which include increased security measures such as a holographic window, a colour-changing bird, puzzle number and raised ink.

The Unlikely Heroes of Quantum Hoops: Braniac underdogs in basketball doc
By Ernest Hardy
Village Voice
May 13, 2008
The documentary Quantum Hoops is firmly rooted in a premise that Americans love and hold dear as a reflection of our collective mythological character: the story of the feisty underdog battling seemingly insurmountable odds. The underdogs in this film, however, are some of the most intellectually gifted people in the country, and the battle they.In Casillo Commodities Italia S.p.a. v. M/V Long Cheer et al., Civ. No. 16-16612 (June 28, 2017), the charterer of the M/V LONG CHEER, Casillo Commodities (“Casillo”), attempted to obtain security from the owner of the vessel, Long Cheer Shipping (“Long Cheer”), for a claim for alleged mold damages to a shipment of Mexican white corn during a voyage from Mexico to Venezuela.
In doing so, Casillo sought the arrest and attachment of the M/V LONG CHEER under Rules B and C of the Supplemental Rules for Admiralty and Maritime Claims and Asset Forfeiture Actions of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Casillo’s application to the Court included a copy of an unsigned voyage charter party that named Long Cheer as a party to the contract. The Court found that Casillo met its Rule B and C burden because the charterparty, even if unsigned, had named Long Cheer and gave Casillo reasonable grounds to arrest the vessel and probable cause to attach the vessel as owner’s property.
Faced with the prospect of having the vessel arrested, Long Cheer posted security in the form of a Club Letter before the vessel entered the port in the United States. Once it avoided disruption to its business operations, Long Cheer filed a motion to vacate the arrest and attachment orders. Long Cheer presented uncontested evidence that they were never intended to be party to the voyage charter and that correspondence regarding the negotiation of the instrument showed that the voyage charter in question was in fact between Casillo and another company, Clipper Bulk, which had previously hired the vessel on time charter from Long Cheer. Long Cheer’s name was inadvertently included on the voyage charter between Casillo and Clipper Bulk as an oversight.
On the basis of the new evidence, Casillo no longer satisfied the reasonable grounds and probable cause burdens under Rules B and C. As such, the Court vacated the orders of arrest and attachment, and ordered Casillo to return the Club Letter.
Long Cheer also requested that the Court award wrongful arrest damages in their favor against Casillo. However, the Court denied the request because Casillo, by relying on the unsigned charter party that undeniably had Long Cheer name on it, did not act with sufficient bad faith, malice, or gross negligence. Although, Casillo should have known that its voyage charter was actually with another party.
Owners and operators should monitor the accuracy of their shipping contracts. Even a small mistake may result in a potential business disruption, and unnecessary and costly litigation.Our third morning began at The New Orleans School of Cooking for a live demo and tasting. Having done this myself, it was really great to relax and enjoy rather than being up in front of the crowd. Our instructor, Chef Michael, was clearly passionate about what he does. While he made a few humorous remarks along the way, Chef remained straight faced and focused throughout. The last people to arrive were forced to stand in front of the entire room, mocked for not being on time, and told they would be the pot washers when he was done. Although that was part of his schtick, you could tell he wasn’t messing around. I felt like I was back in class as a kid! Or better yet, as though I was right out of a scene out of Julie and Julia.
When we first sat down, everyone was given biscuits straight from the oven. Nothing says southern cuisine like a warm biscuit. Here, they were served with Steen’s 100% pure cane syrup, an apparently healthier version of what we’re used to eating due to its natural properties. Then, Sweet Treat was sprinkled over top–their local product which comes in both cinnamon sugar and chocolate sugar varieties. Yum.
Next, we watched Chef Michael prepare his corn and crab bisque. This was by far my favorite thing of the morning. Rather than masking the corn as an afterthought, the whole kernels really stood out and the seafood was flavorful without being fishy. The rich, creamy soup was prepared with their own all-purpose seasoning known asJoe’s Stuff. (That made it through security so I can make this myself…), a very low sodium spice that still required no additional salt or pepper. Spot on. And you know I love creating soup recipes. Especially corn and crab bisque.
Shrimp creole was our second dish, which began with a roux– a staple in most NOLA recipes. I’m sure you’ve made this mixture of flour and butter before (It’s used to thicken gravy, mac and cheese, etc.), and it’s the base of other well-known dishes such as gumbo and étouffée. This spicy, tomato based recipe offered a fiery punch that was filling and delicious over rice. (Hubby actually ordered it in an omelette the next morning for breakfast so it’s versatile as well.) One of the best tips I learned was Chef Michael’s rule of thumb for cooking seafood: Oysters take 6 minutes, frozen fish goes in for 2 minutes and anything already cooked gets added to your sauce or soup at the very end for only 30 seconds. Definitely something to remember!
Before he even began his savory cooking, Chef told us about our dessert. He said guests should always know what to look forward to in case they need to save room. As you know, that’s never been an issue for me with my separate compartment, but I did appreciate his logic. So you can imagine my excitement when we were learning how to make pralines and bananas foster. Although nothing will compare to Brennan’s, this one was great too, and I will certainly be experimenting at home…with the fire department on call during my big flame finish.
The pralines reminded me of the process for making chocolate bark, but with a lot more prep work as you first melt down sugar, butter and milk. They taste a lot like a fudge. While the originals were delicious, I thought their chocolate version was the best out of all the ones I tasted throughout our trip. What I loved most was their use of all natural ingredients, without preservatives. While so many prepackaged versions can sit on the shelves for weeks on end, these are made fresh daily. They even advised customers on when to buy them depending on the day they would be enjoyed. For example, if they wanted them as souvenirs and weren’t leaving until the following week, they would suggest returning closer to their departure so they would be fresh.
After our cooking class we got ready for our next stop: The World War 11 Museum, which I will forever refer to as the “Bananas Foster Malted Milkshake Museum”. You see, Hubby is a history buff. Me, not so much. Having always focused on not living in the past, this was never a favorite subject of mine. Unless of course it pertains to the origin of one of my favorite meals, and then I’m glued. So, as I’m sure you’re not surprised, I did a little research before we left. Was I checking out the memorabilia we would see? Nope. The gift shop? Nah. I was hoping to find out if they had a cafe so I could look forward to ordering. And there it was. The most exciting exhibit of all: the ice cream shop. A gorgeous display behind glass showcasing the many available flavors. There was red velvet, peanut butter and jelly and yes, bananas foster. And they made their shakes malted. So that’s what I got. Oh and the museum was nice too. (In all seriousness though, it really was an incredible place with a beautiful tribute. Utmost respect goes out to all the brave people who made such great sacrifices in the defense of freedom.)
On our way back we stopped at another one of the candy shops (seriously they were everywhere!) for some heavenly hash. Totally sounds like something a college student would make with the windows cracked, but it has nothing to do with how it sounds. Although I did have a sugar high afterwards if that counts for anything. This giant hunk of milk or dark chocolate (I got dark), marshmallow with pecans, almonds and/or walnuts literally tastes like a hot chocolate. It is heavenly for sure. I had never even heard of it before, but I looked it up and realized a few brands actually sell it as an ice cream flavor. Hmmm. It’s certainly very rocky road-esque. Something I will surely be making ASAP so stay tuned.
From then on it was pretty much up to us where we wanted to dine. This was our first evening without dinner reservations, giving us a chance to fill the hours however we felt. Well, Hubby felt like going on a haunted ghost tour. At night. If any of you know me well, this is on my list of things to avoid in general, never mind to sign up for on vacation. But, it falls under the category of stuff you do when you really love someone. Part of our unwritten marriage contract if you will.
So since we were away and the trip was all about new experiences, I didn’t hesitate when he asked me. I was all about keeping an open mind and going with the flow. Besides, if it was that important to him, I knew it would make me feel good to see him happy. I was kind of secretly a bit excited to break through my boundaries, be brave and see what the adrenaline rush might bring. And once we were there, I actually enjoyed it. (Please don’t tell him this though because it will then be more difficult to use as an example when I want to drag him to a chick flick with me in the future.)
This two-hour moonlit walk around the city took us to some spectacular views and spooky places in areas we never would’ve explored otherwise. The scariest part? There was no food involved. This may have been the longest either of us went without eating.
Needless to say when we got out around 10:30, we were hungry. It was a new feeling actually, having not allowed ourselves to get to that point during the entire trip.
“Did you hear that? My stomach actually growled!”
“Mine too, this is so exciting!”
At that time, most of the kitchens had closed, so we went to Chef John Besh’s LÜKE via recommendation from our concierge. It was a fun, bright atmosphere, offering everything from pb&j oysters to slow-cooked rabbit to regional options such as pasta étouffée and jalapeno grits. I went with an exceptionally large plate of Prince Edward Island mussels steamed with garlic and thyme, served with a cone of house-made fries. It was just what I wanted. They tried to warn me it was going to be a lot of food. I sure showed them when I finished the entire serving. Amateurs.
But what we were really after was dessert. The very famous Cafe DuMonde, known for their beignets and cafe au lait (the locals just call it coffee and donuts), is open 24/7. Perfect for night owls like us. This was definitely the best midnight snack–pillows of fried dough covered with an avalanche of powdered sugar. My mother would love it. The combination of the warm, fried pastry mixed with our overflowing iced chicory coffee was incredible.
And for our very final nightcap, we returned to our suite for the routine chocolates and pralines on the pillow. Finally, it was time to lay down and nap until breakfast. We had sweet dreams for sure.
Come back tomorrow for our final day of the trip!

“I didn’t expect to see you here man,” Jack says to me. His voice speaks with all the strength needed to talk through his smashed nose and eviscerated- ah, almost let it slip there.
The only person I’ve seen angrier is your mother.
“You gonna answer me or what?” says Jack.
I tell him, “Look, I’m only here because my wife’s always worried about my health.”
That part’s true.
I then tell Jack “I barely feel anything at all.”
That part is not true. There’s, it’s, it’s like a singularity of sharpness at a point on my lower leg. It’s like if the most cringe-worthy part of one of those stupid telenovelas manifested as a parasite. It’s like when Jaime Bosque stabbed me with a tire iron in third grade. That kid was strong. But this pain ain’t too bad. When I’m talking to Jack, or to you, it’s hard to remember that tire iron feeling.
Maybe if Jack got fixed up, he’d be inclined to generosity. I say to Jack, “Jack, let me take a look at your face, I know medicine.” He squirms away from my outreached hand. I don’t know why he’s upset— the stitches I gave Brianna last year held on for five whole hours. Plenty of time to heal up on its own.
“Señor Thumb,” says Jack, pushing himself against the other henchmen.
“Señor Thumb,” he continues, “if you knew what was happening, you wouldn’t have led me under that fire escape.”
That wasn’t my fault.
So I say to him, “Jack, if you want me to solve your problem, I’ll do it: wear a helmet. Wear two, actually— I just blueprinted something like that. If you give me my money back, I might even make one for you.”
His fists tighten, and his body tenses up. I wince.
“I don’t see a helmet on your [shiny] head,” says Jack.
Now that’s uncalled for. He didn’t actually say [shiny]: I just put that in my mind because I don’t want my inner child hearing such language out of his mouth. You like shiny stuff, right? But anyways, talking to my inner child like that, who the fuck does he think he is? If Sinister Sid were here, he’d smile with his golden teeth and whisper, “Your emotions are never wrong. Let your desires guide you down every right path, for there are no wrong ones. And remember, if I am not doing good for you, you are permitted to kill me at any time.” Well Sid, I don’t think you should be killed. But my emotions are telling me two things right now. One, I want payback. Two, I want to give into my leg pain and let warm tears stream down my hard cheekbones and black mustache. I’m only gonna follow one of those things. So I summon the sharpness of a hot poker to retort back with a “Go stick your head in a [magic mirror], you [pony].”
Otis, still standing in front of Jack, gulps.
“Oh [frolic] you, you [princess],” says Jack. “I should be making the uniforms round here. If I were designing duds, I’d have your suit stick your [Barbie doll] in your [play set].”
Now my actual inner child is getting heard. My inner child’s telling me to give Jack a kick so loud and painful that Jaime Bosque will hear it from across the country and start having nightmares again. I give Jack a fast kick.
It is loud and painful.
For me.
I used the wrong [wishing] leg.
Everything in that leg seizes, and the nerves flare alongside it. I regain my breath. My eyes water. Then I notice Jack winding up his fat arm. It’s aimed right at my charcoal-colored jacket, in particular the forearm, in particular where my tattoo is hidden.
I punch him in the face before he gets me. He recoils back, and collapses into the window behind us. The window wobbles. My knuckles sting, but it doesn’t matter much. Jack kicks his leg up in instinct. His leg hits Otis in the ass. Otis falls on OddBo, cracking his phone when they hit ground. They both yelp like John Henry’s hammer whacked their nuts.
Goddamnit. It’s like our scrap with Beaver-Man all over again.
Two security guards (didn’t even notice them until now, they’re such wallflowers) arrive to hold Jack and I back as we continue shouting insults at each other. OddBo, meanwhile, caresses his neck and calls out for a pillow.
As Jack and I spar in a deadly duel to the disgrace, the world moves forward. Narp, OddBo, and Otis all get called up to the emergency room proper. Twice that many people replace them in the waiting room. Jack and I don’t let up our battle of intelligences. And as the leg smarts from the kick, I notice that my inner will (as Sid might call it) grows stronger. Instead of remembering how hospital bills can wreck a family, or remembering what my wife looks like, I just need to remember if Jack will know what pinche punietas means. That’s a good use of all the air I’m breathing into my brain. Plus, I usually don’t like to brag, but I think I got the upper hand with a decisive “Eat a [Prince Charming].”
When Jack’s name is finally called by a raspy voice, the henchman sputters out a limp “Well, well, well why don’t you ask Beaver Man if that’s what happened?” before the two security guards drag him behind the swinging doors to the emergency room. I lay my head against the cold glass behind me. That feels good. For a little bit, at least.
Now here comes the bad part.
To Be Continued in Part 4UnNews:"Weird Al" Yankovic vandalizes Wikipedia
5 December 2007
WIKIPEDIA, Internets. "Weird Al" Yankovic, in a meaningless and stressful way, vandalized Wikipedia this very day. The target in particular was Atlantic Records, upon which Weird Al wrote in big blue text: YOU SUCK! Following his submission, his IP address was personally banned from Wikipedia by Jimbo Wales, who also sentenced his IP address to one month of rehabilitation. The reason for why Weird Al did this is unknown but the assumed reason is that he was given the greenlight to mock some popular song called "You're Beautiful" and turn it into "You're Pitiful". The song was not released due to the CEO thinking it was a little too much. Weird Al had this to say:
“FUCKING ATLANTIC RECORDS, YOU HUMOR-HATING BASTARDS!!!”
Shortly after that comment, he had to replace it with his then unknown hit "White & Nerdy". While making the music video, he decided to display his hate for Atlantic Records in the method Wikipedia wouldn't let him do: write in big bold letters the words YOU SUCK!. Shortly after the video was released, many Wikipedians (and a few Uncyclopedians) decided to vandalize the Atlantic Records page with the same big bold text. After a few seconds, reverts were happening, followed by the banning of a lot of users. To this date there are over 100 bans relating to the Atlantic Records article.
A meeting was called by Jimbo Wales and the finest Wikipedians to discuss the matter, mostly involving removing the big bold text. After a few hours they finally decided to remove big bold text from Wikipedia and to sentence "Weird Al" Yankovic to 1 month of rehabilitation which meant no further songs for him. He also was forced to create a PSA about not vandalizing Wikipedia which involved him begging for those of you in the know.
Despite the removal and sentencing of "Weird Al" Yankovic, the Atlantic Records article is still vandalized to this day.

In repeating, and after that increasing on, these experiments, Tesla experimented with powering a Ruhmkorff coil which has a superior pace alternator he had been acquiring as part of an enhanced arc lighting process but located that the high frequency present overheated the iron Main and melted the insulation involving the principal and secondary windings within the coil.

Ralph Waldo Emerson
To believe your own thought, to believe that what is true for you in your private heart is true for all men,--that is genius. The great man is he who in the midst of a crowd keeps with perfect sweetness the independence of solitude. To be great is to be misunderstood. Whenever a mind is simple, and receives a divine wisdom, old things pass away,--means, teachers, texts, temples fall; it lives now, and absorbs the past and future into the present hour. And so the reliance on Property, including the reliance on governments which protect it, is the want of self-reliance..

1) Do you think you're hot?
1) Do you think you're hot?
Hot as in? Be it hot-tempered then it’s quite a yes for nowadays. Be it hot as in body temperature then it’s a yes too. (Hold on to my hands for living proof.)
2) Upload your favourite picture of you.
2) Upload your favourite picture of you.
3) Why do you like that picture?
Because it symbolizes the best thing that we can do with our lips as it shows. Ouww. But my most-favorite picture would be my display image at the profile because that was me back then, when I have not put on my make-ups, (Hey, no lipsticks and no foundation. No gothic-look like what I used to put on now. And no pimples too. Yes. None at all.) I didn’t know how to paint my nails, (and didn’t even bother to get them painted once I was having my menstrual of course) and I have not gotten my hair colored yet that time. So it was the purest of me. Cuba compare dengan gambar yang di bawah ni. Ibu-ibu mesti beristighfar bila tengok. (highlight : warna pada kuku.) Oh.
4) When was the last time you ate pizza?
Pizza. Pizza. Now I am craving for it. You should take the blame for matter’s arising. Hehs. Last time when we went out to KLCC during the examination if I am not mistaken. Why?
5) The last song you listened to?
Hate Me by Blue October.
6) What are you doing right now besides this?
I am having this tiny lil voice inside of my head. And it’s torturing me. And I was forced to listen to it. And so, I am listening.
7) What name would you prefer besides yours?
Sofea, my darling fish. (She’s living in my Friendster profile anyway, virtually of course.) Marissa. (My friends from third language class call me with that name. I've told them so many times that that's not my name, that my name is Syahirah but they keep calling me with that name for a reason. And I think I like it. The name is beautiful.) And J!Ll too. (That’s a special name to me.)
People I tag:
1. Kak Jamie
2. Qasiyh
3. Shirley
4. Linziana
5. Athirah
8) Who is number 1?
Kakak angkat saya di sekolah menengah dahulu. Beliau sangat ceria dan baik hati. Selalu bagi saya kad-kad yang sweet, makanan dan dedication juga. Hiks. A cheerful sister who made me laugh of everything, blessed with a loving husband I suppose and soon to be a mother. Will make a young-hot-lovely momma, surely.
9) Number 3 is having a relationship with?
Oh-Ow, I have no idea but surely she’s in one. She’s gorgeous I tell you. My schoolmate back in secondary school. Lama tak jumpa ni but when we were in the final year of school, she was madly in-love with this Muslim boy and I was once believed that she’s going to convert and marry him. Hehs. Akhirnya Evertonia yang convert. *OK,iamoutofcontrol.thememories.it’sallcomingbacktome.nowimisseverybodyinschool*
10) Say something about number 5.
The junior next door back in MOZAC as well as my University-mate. Another shopaholic. And a darling girl too.
11) How about number 4?
Again my ex-schoolmate in MOZAC. Trademark beliau adalah gelaknya yang unik. A shopaholic too. Tidak boleh dipisahkan dengan Marseli. Ada gossip dengan encik F juga. Hehs. (Opss,did I say it out loud?)
12) Who is number 2?
My junior back in secondary school whom I adore for loudness and look. And the honesty too. You rock, girl!
OK, I am tagging the people from my past because I am missing them all. I was peeping through a few blogs of the people I was with during my school years and here I got to see my cousin's blog with his lover. Ahha, Gotcha! But it was set to private. I wish they will get married soon because they've been together since forever and I just can't wait to see them together. (Sorry if the blog is supposed to be a secret. Don't worry, I am not going to tell. Count on me! *giggles*)
Right, all the people are having such beautiful life and I can't help myself from feeling a little bit like a loser. You know, the feeling you get when you have absolutely nothing at all in life, when you reach nowhere better, you have nothing better, while others are so happy with their lovely spouse, some are getting children, some are engaged, some are getting married, most of them are working with big companies and I believe complimented with handsome amount of salary and they are all having blast with their perfect life while here I am, having nothing. Maybe I should learn how to be grateful again as some say I should. I can't help myself to envy those with love surrounds them, especially those who are engaging themselves in serious relationship. No, I am not up for marriage by now. Marriage is never a play thing, it's not a try-and-error game. No No No. I am just longing for the feeling of secure, to wake up in the morning and know by heart that there is someone by my side for good and for bad. Someone that I can turn to. Someone that I can rely on. Someone who will never get bored of knowing me, loving me, and being with me. Someone resistant, the one with the highest capasity to tolerate with my ever-changing moods, with the spoiled me. Someone who will make me as the priority over everything else. Oh I am so carried away with the illusion of perfect life I am imagining myself having. I don't know what I really want in life actually. Suddenly I am lost. No, I mean I know what I am wanting for, it's just that I think I am not going to be able to have it anyway. Maybe I am too demanding. Maybe I am expecting too much. OK, now I complicate things. Maybe I should stop reading the stupid novels. Maybe I should stop writing. Maybe I should really learn how to be grateful. Maybe I should just stop looking at people. But anyway, I am very happy to know that everybody is leading such a good life. Except me. Chill.
[note : I am happy to announce that my ex-bestfriend is getting married next week. (Yet another person I envy.) We are now good friends, of course, just not that close anymore. My class will start on December 30th, and she will be married a day before. I don't know whether to go or not to go. Boo me for being indecisive. So friends, should I go or should not?]

NotesThe principal strategy of the Company since its incorporation in 1995, has been to be exclusively dedicated to making investments in or with Cuban businesses. This policy remains unchanged and management believes that this will result in long–term capital growth. The other principal strategies are the following:
Balanced Focus on Established, Revenue–Producing Assets and New Development Projects
The Company’s strategies include maintaining a balance in its investment portfolio between established, revenue producing assets in the Company’s main operating segments, as exemplified by the Company’s indirect interests in the Miramar Trade Center and the Hotels, on the one hand, and new development projects, refurbishments and other capital investments that will contribute to long–term capital growth, on the other hand. Under this strategy, the Company has invested in existing Cuban joint venture companies that own mature assets, as well as in new development projects. CEIBA believes that this will provide stable and sustainable cash flows, with a strong potential for future growth.
Remain the Principal Foreign Investor in Cuba’s Commercial Real Estate Sector
CEIBA’s strategy regarding commercial properties is to remain the principal foreign investor in Cuba’s commercial real estate sector through the addition of new properties within the Cuban joint ventures in which it already has an interest, whether by acquisition or new construction.
Remain a Leading Foreign Investor in Cuba’s Tourism Real Estate Sector
CEIBA intends to continue to be one of the leading foreign investors in the tourism real estate sector by maintaining a portfolio of investments in high–end (4 and 5 star) hotels located in Cuba’s main tourist and business destinations.
Investment in other Prioritized Sectors of the Cuban Economy
Given the present efforts of the Cuban government to modernize the Cuban economy, the Company will consider investment opportunities in new sectors of the Cuban economy prioritized by the Cuban government as such opportunities present themselves.
Be Flexible in the Deployment of Cash Flows
The Company’s interests in commercial real estate and hotel properties provide revenue streams that may be utilized for new acquisitions, investments in the development of new properties, upgrading of existing properties or the payment of dividends to shareholders of the Company. Given the time necessary to obtain all government approvals and to construct new projects in Cuba, one of the Company’s main focuses in the last five years has been to generate stable and sustainable cash flows. At the same time, the Company also intends to continue to invest in Cuban joint venture companies that are in the process of developing commercial real estate and hotel projects. The Company believes these development projects have the potential to create long–term capital growth for the Company’s shareholders. The Company invests surplus funds in interest–bearing structured finance transactions and other financial instruments and commercial paper relating to Cuba. The Company seeks to structure the repayment terms of such facilities to approximate the time when funds will be required for future investment requirements of new and current investments in Cuban joint venture companies.
Use Leverage Prudently and Optimize Capital Structure
The Company is debt–free, both at the holding company level and at the level of each underlying investment, including the Cuban joint venture companies in which the Company has an interest. The Company believes that the absence of debt provides the Company with the ability to leverage its assets in the future, should the cost and other conditions for debt financing for Cuban assets become more acceptable, thereby allowing the Company to optimize its capital structure and to make further investments or to return capital to shareholders. The future capital structure of the Company will be dependent on the cost and availability of debt financing, the ability of the Company to develop or acquire new investment projects and the continued improvement in local market conditions.Product Description

Hi Gracie, Thanks for the inspiring comments ! I know that you are a superb chef and know your way around the kitchen !By JOSH DUBOW, AP Sports Writer
SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) — Joe Pavelski took just 15 seconds to end San Jose’s two-game scoring drought..”.
“We were bad tonight, obviously,” McDavid said. .”
Playing with a lead for the first time all series, the Sharks were energized and dominated the play early. Even the struggling power play that had scored only once and allowed two short-handed goals in the first three games got into the action..
Couture, who led the NHL in playoff scoring last year, missed the final seven games of the regular season and hadn’t been at his usual form to start this series. He wore a cage to protect his mouth the first two games before going back to the half-visor for Game 3.
San Jose then took the game over in the second starting when Marleau scored on an early power play. Sorensen knocked in a rebound midway through the period and Couture ended Talbot’s night with a wrister from the circle.
“It’s already forgotten in my mind,” Talbot said. “I’ve had some time to let it go already. Just go through my process and let it go and be ready Thursday.”
Pavelski added his second late on the period to take advantage of Draisaitl’s penalty as San Jose converted four of eight power-play chances after going 1 for 14 the first three games.
That prompted chants of “We want seven!” from the delirious crowd and it came when Schlemko scored on the power play in the third.
“We’ve been saying we have confidence in it,” Thornton said. “It’s just a matter of time before we strike. Just keep to our fundamentals and we’d be fine and you saw that tonight.”
NOTES: The Rangers beat Atlanta 7-0 on April 17, 2007. … The previous fastest playoff goal for San Jose came 28 seconds into the game by Dany Heatley against Los Angeles in 2011. … NFL Hall of Famer Jerry Rice opened the dressing room to lead the Sharks on the ice to start the game.

NORTH EASTHAM — Colton Leach scored two goals as Nauset used a dominating performance to remain undefeated in the Atlantic Coast League with a 5-0 victory over Dennis-Yarmouth in boys soccer on Tuesday night.
Nauset improves to 4-0-1 in the ACL and 5-2-2 overall. The Dolphins fall to 3-2 in the ACL and 3-3 overall.
Noah Casey opened the scoring off an assist from Leach just two minutes into the game. Leach made it 2-0 on a brilliant individual effort at the 10-minute mark and Willie Boyd's rebound off a blast by Junior Chambers gave the Warriors a 3-0 lead at the half.
Chambers scored from Jacob LaBranche early in the second half and Leach closed out the scoring from Sam McNulty at the midway point.
Sean O'Sullivan, Hunter Keyes and Anthony Catanzaro helped Tyler Packet earn the shutout for Nauset in net.
Barnstable 3, Dartmouth 2: In Dartmouth, the Indians were the first to score in each half, but the Red Raiders were quick to respond as they won their first Old Colony League game.
Dartmouth may have scored the first goal 20 minutes in, but Barnstable followed that with two quick scores. The first coming off the foot of Felipe Campos on a pass from Pedro de Almeida.
Nine minutes later Barnstable scored again, this time Almeida scoring a goal of his own off a pass from Newton Jordao.
After the half, Dartmouth was again the first to score, tying things up at 2-2 until Campos scored his second goal off a pass from Jose Gonzalez to close out the scoring.
Victor Gomes also put in a strong game for the Red Raiders (2-5-1, 1-1 OCL) at left back, squeezing plays out to the sidelines.
Mashpee 2, Hull 1: The Falcons enjoyed the Pirates hospitality, knocking in two balls off of defenders en route to their first victory of the season in Hull.
Mack Burton scored 10:30 into the match on a ball off a Pirate defender for a 1-0 lead.
Hull equalized 16 minutes into the second half. Then Mashpee's Cameron Ferola knocked a ball in off the face of a defender midway through the half for the eventual game-winner.
Mashpee (1-6) got strong play on defense from Bailey Bartley while Ben Dagneault and Riley Lacroix provided offensive pressure in the second half.
East Bridgewater 6, Monomoy 1: The Vikings jumped out to a big first-half lead and cruised to the win over the Sharks in East Bridgewater.
Monomoy, playing without starting goalie John Vagenas, came out flat, falling behind 5-1 at the half. The Sharks (1-4 South Shore League, 1-5 overall) bounced back after the break and played a very good second half in front of backup keeper Michael Penninger. Senior sweeper Gerald Reid also had a strong game.
Monomoy's lone goal was scored by Luke Hartigan with an assist from Odane Morrison.
Falmouth 4, Sandwich 1: Falmouth scored early en route to its third win in a row with an Atlantic Coast League victory in East Sandwich.
Thajay Walker opened up scoring five minutes in with a goal on a pass from Peter Dascombe-Olson.
The Clippers (3-5, 3-2 ACL) then scored again at the 25th minute with Ian Cicalis finding the back of the net.
Nate Estrela then made it 3-0, when he netted a goal off a pass from Dascombe-Olson.
Sandwich opened up scoring in the second half when Zack Boudreau netted the lone Blue Knight goal off an assist from Christian Rossomando.
Walker then closed the scoring with his second goal of the game off an assist from Cicalis.
Martha's Vineyard 2, Coyle-Cassidy 0: In another dominant performance for the Vineyarders (5-0-2, 2-0 Eastern Athletic Conference), Colin Cameron and Sam Entner tallied second-half goals in a shutout victory over the Warriors in Taunton.The Graduate School of Science and Technology is comprised of 10 departments-4 science departments (Mathematics, Physics, Information Sciences, and Applied Biological Science) and 6 engineering departments (Architecture, Pure and Applied Chemistry, Electrical Engineering, Industrial Administration, Mechanical Engineering, and Civil Engineering) and is striving for enriched research and education while promoting the fusion of science and engineering. In particular, the Graduate School is making efforts to ferment voluntary motivation for learning among students, and sends out almost 30 doctors and approximately 500 students with master's degrees into society every year. In addition, the Graduate School also provides enriched learning facilities, including a library and computer network environment, and the expansive campus, which is dotted with the latest research facilities and equipment, can be considered as one of the best educational and research environments in Japan. We have also established a cooperative system for education and research based on the Joint Graduate School System with 11 other public and private research institutes, and are actively approaching joint research and invitation of various faculty members from within Japan and from abroad.
Starting in academic year 2017, the Graduate School of Science and Technology is scheduled to introduce a “cross-disciplinary course” which will pursue education and research across different specializations. In addition to pursuing collaborative research among faculty and students from different specializations in order to “achieve innovation” and “produce high-value added results,” the aim of this cross-disciplinary course is to offer students specialized courses from other majors, as well as guidance from a variety of faculty, in order to develop them into researchers and engineers possessing a broad range of knowledge and experience.
Also, the Department of Applied Biological Science and the Department of Pure and Applied Chemistry are scheduled to introduce a “six-year integrated education course” starting in academic year 2017 which will pursue education and research according to an integrated curriculum linking the fourth year of undergraduate school with the first and second year of the master's course.
PAGE TOPForcing paroled inmates to provide blood samples for a federal DNA databank violates the parolees' constitutional rights unless there is reasonable suspicion they committed a crime, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Thursday.
Legal experts said the 2-1 decision -- the first detailed ruling by a federal appeals court on the issue -- is certain to be appealed by federal prosecutors and likely to be reviewed either by a larger panel of 9th Circuit judges or by the U.S. Supreme Court.
"Reasonable suspicion must exist before the government may compel parolees to submit to the extraction of blood from their bodies contrary to their wishes," wrote Judge Stephen Reinhardt.
DNA samples submitted to the FBI's DNA databank have been used in 9,000 investigations, according to government figures.
Reinhardt acknowledged that DNA testing had led to exoneration of wrongfully convicted people and to solving crimes. But he expressed serious reservations about the creation of massive databanks such as the one in this case.Welcome to 2010 I want to start this year’s articles by looking at some genuine ways to build a successful Home Based Online Marketing Business.
After over twenty years in the Timeshare Industry the latter part of which has been spent mostly recruiting and training new sales consultants and reps, I once again found myself out of work or Surplus to requirements due to the cut backs or changes in products and company policies.
“Does that sound familiar to you?”
As most of that twenty years had been spent as a self employed freelance consultant, with no unemployment back up or way of replacing that income other than finding another job, I soon realized that at fifty years old this was becoming increasingly more difficult and I was rapidly eating into any savings I had built up through all my hard graft, for someone else’s business and benefit.
“Does that sound familiar to you?”
It was the turning point in my life when I realized that the only person I could really rely on for a secure long term career and guaranteed income was me!
I wanted to create my own business that I could run from my home, work the hours I chose to and generally fit my work around my life instead of trying to fit my life around my work as I had done so often in the past.”
“Does that sound familiar to you as well?”
I have been writing articles for my Sales and Marketing Blog: Simple Sales And Marketing Solutions and my personal Blog: In Between The Tapas And Tantrums for a quite a while and they are both getting regular traffic and good reviews so I decided that if I could market and sell other peoples products and build up their businesses so well, why can’t I market and sell my own products and build my own business?
This year’s articles will be mainly focusing on the successes and failures, joys and frustrations and ups and downs that I have experienced along my almost two year journey to eventually achieving my dreams and the financial freedom of being my own boss and producing and selling my own products through my own home based internet business.
“Don’t waste two years of your valuable time or maybe even give up!”
Use my experiences of what works and what doesn’t work and cut all the guess work out of making money on the internet.”
Keep dropping by for regular updates and check out My Youtube Channel where I will be posting a series of Free Sales Training and Marketing Videos over the next few months.
So here’s to a very healthy, wealthy, prosperous and successful home based internet marketing 2010 for us all.Welcome to the no deposit casino bonus section of wolfgang-dohl.de Here you will find the most up to date and latest free spins and no deposit offers that the.

[BRASÍLIA] Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff launched a late bid on Thursday.
Ms Rousseff had been scratching around for support in the lower house of congress, which is scheduled to vote Sunday on whether to move forward with impeachment proceedings.
On Thursday, she launched a fresh line of defence. Her government's top lawyer, Jose Eduardo Cardozo, filed for an injunction to halt the weekend's proceedings.
The Supreme Court scheduled a special session for late Thursday afternoon to examine the request.
Ms Rousseff is fighting to save her presidency over charges that she illegally manipulated government accounts to mask the effects of recession during her 2014 re-election and in 2015.
The government's appeal alleged procedural failings in the case against Ms Rousseff, saying it had violated her right to a defence.
"Evidence unrelated to the case has been included in the process, such as matters related to President Dilma (Rousseff)'s previous term," Mr Cardozo said in the filing.
He called the impeachment drive "a truly Kafkaesque process in which the accused is unable to know precisely what she is accused of or why."
Ms.
Ms Rousseff on Thursday held a meeting with ministers and some of the lawmakers still loyal to her, a presidential source said, shortly before Mr Cardozo announced his appeal.
Several of the parties in Ms Rousseff's coalition have jumped ship, starting with the PMDB of her vice president Michel Temer.
Scores of lawmakers have turned against Ms, Ms Rousseff would be suspended from office for six months.
Mr Temer would step into her place while the impeachment process runs its course.
Ms Rousseff has branded Mr Temer a traitor. She says he is the leader of a "coup" against her along with the speaker of the lower house, Eduardo Cunha.
Lawmakers who have yet to declare their position were facing fierce lobbying, including from Ms Rousseff's top ally and predecessor as president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.
But he too faces pressure: the courts have suspended his appointment as Rousseff's chief of staff over a corruption case against him, linked to a huge graft scandal at state oil company Petrobras.
The country, meanwhile, has sunk into its worst recession in decades.
Protesters for and against Ms Rousseff have called for demonstrations this weekend in Brasilia. Security forces have put up fences to protect government buildings from possible disturbances.
The president of the International Olympic Committee's coordination commission said Wednesday that preparations for the Olympics in August are running on time despite the political crisis.
The IOC "is working really hard to make sure that the deadlines are respected," Nawal El Moutawakel told a news conference in Rio de Janeiro, where the Games will run from August 5 to 21.
"We are waiting for Sunday to see how the situation develops."

The Devil is in the Details
Hand to God – Victory Gardens Theatre
Perhaps the devil made him do it, but Robert Askins’ dark, irreverent, riveting comic drama is about honesty and dealing with grief. At its core, we have a story of a teenaged boy and his mother, both hurting deep inside, trying to come to terms with the shocking death of a father and husband. Margery has been put in charge of a church-sponsored puppetry workshop by her minister, Pastor Greg, supposedly to give the mourning young widow an outlet for her bereavement and partially to provide his young parishioners with creative involvement in the Lutheran church.
First produced Off-Broadway in 2011 and 2014, Askins’ sassy, shocking comedy eventually premiered on Broadway the following year, where it was nominated for five Tony Awards, including Best Play. With its recent release to regional theatres, his comic drama has currently become the most-produced play in the country. This highly anticipated Chicago production, under the sharp, insightful direction of Gary Griffin, is top-notch in every way.
First is the script itself. This playwright has crafted a smart, well-written play using dark humor, jaw-dropping
dialogue, compelling characters, an unbelievable story and outrageous situations to tell a moving story about how people cope with tragedy. It looks at man’s belief in the presence of both God and Satan in today’s world, and how organized religion is employed to provide comfort to those in need.
Next, this production features an imaginatively clever and versatile set, designed by Joe Shermoly, and stocked with detailed dressing and props by Michael Dold. Then there’s Rachel Christianson’s inspired puppet designs, with their usage guided by Daniel Dempsey. David Woolley also meets the challenge of this script with some powerful, authentic fight choreography.
Then there’s Gary Griffin’s sensitive and wise direction. Everything from the Broadway production is there, but here we find an added layer of empathy for these five damaged characters. All of them are hurting, in one way or another, and audiences will share in their emotional journeys in a way that the original production seemed to neglect. This might be attributed to the relative intimacy of this venue, but it can’t be denied that Mr. Griffin knows how to tap into the heart of his characters with everything he directs.
Of course it’s ultimately in the hands of this talented cast to bring the story to life. And what an excellent ensemble this production can boast! Janelle Snow, who often resembles a young Julia Roberts, is magnificent as the Texan widow who suddenly finds herself in the midst of a hellish situation, not unlike that of William Peter Blatty’s The Exorcist. At first Margery is a quietly suffering widow, simply trying to help her young son and herself cope with her husband’s death. Then suddenly, Ms. Snow soars as woman faced with a much more challenging conflict. As the actress journeys through this 90-minute, two-act play, she grows stronger and more passionate, ever the grizzly mama ready to fight and do anything necessary to save her son, as well as herself.
Curtis Edward Jackson, so excellent in recent productions of “A Splintered Soul” and “Brilliant Adventures,” adds another feather to his cap as the antagonistic, oversexed punk, Timothy. Smartly, Mr. Jackson doesn’t simply play this role as a one note villain; he travels his own personal road of pain and frustration, lashing out at everyone weaker than himself and seeking love from the one person who’s ready to provide it. Nina Ganet is feisty and fervent as Jessica, the young girl next door who alone seems to really like and care for Jason. Her modus operandi in this play is simple: she enjoys the creativity provided by working with her puppet and, when confronted by a supernatural calamity, remains levelheaded and makes good choices. She’s the audience’s onstage surrogate in this production.
Eric Slater, such a talent in recent productions of “Diary of Anne Frank” and “Feathers & Teeth,” is powerful as Paster Greg. Slater’s character at first brings his own smarmy personal agenda into helping Margery but, when push comes to shove, he returns to the greater good as the leader of his flock. Again, in this production, Griffin has chosen to carefully direct Mr. Slater in a way that he’s not a mere two-dimensional character. Pastor Greg has wants and needs of his own, but he’s first and foremost a minister to the needs of his congregation.
But, as would be expected, it’s Alex Weisman’s stunning portrayal of Jason/Tyrone (his evil hand puppet) that makes this production a must-see. Mr. Weisman has turned in some wonderful performances in the past. Notably he’s impressed audiences in “My Name is Asher Lev,” “You Never Can Tell” and, of course, his award-winning “The History Boys;” but this may be the role for which he’ll forever after be remembered. Come next year’s AEA Jeff Awards, there can be little doubt that this talented young actor will be among the nominees for Best Actor. Weisman straddles a pointed picket fence of being a shy, troubled teenager one minute and a muck-mouthed monster the next. Theatergoers are left pondering whether Jason, himself, is being possessed by the devil or if his hand puppet, Tyrone, is actually Satan. In many ways, Askins’ dark comedy may be a contemporary version of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, with the puppet offering the boy a means of venting his deep-seated anger and frustration. In any case, Weisman’s switch, sometimes even mid-sentence, between a sweet, innocent victim and a foul-mouthed foe is astounding to behold. His performance is definitely worthy of the heartfelt standing ovation he receives nightly.
Ever since Biblical times the devil’s been blamed for everything from loss and accidents to illness and death. He’s a scapegoat used to absorb every unpleasantry under the sun. In Robert Askins’ remarkably entertaining and
mesmerizing black comedy, it’s that same enfant terrible who’s deemed responsible for one particular young boy’s behavior. Don’t assume, however, that this play, because it features puppets, is a family show. This very adult play, filled with four-letter expletives and simulated sex, may be viewed as a supernatural story or a cautionary tale about the extreme effects of sublimated anger. But, at the heart of this tale, we have a moving, heartfelt story about people facing grief, fear and honesty, however controversial and soul-searching. This is an evening of theatre audiences will never forget because the devil most certainly is in the details.

Its a super easy and fun project to do for our girls. I stitched this one with a pattern I have made myself. I also really like this easy tutorial at Progressivepioneer for a different style of a sling, maybe I'll give it a try when H is a bit older.
The whole thing cost $0! I used scraps left over from some other projects. The printed part is cotton and the black is jersey.

I have always wanted one of these baby wraps with both my babies but they were just too out of budget for us both times. Plus we got 3 of those backpack carriers, so we just used that despite the fact I did't really like them. Now that its so worn out, we might get this wrap. Simply love them! I love how the baby has such closeness to the mother/parent compared to the backpack carriers.
Has anyone used one of these baby wraps? How was your experience with them?
actually madiha bought this and showed me... i wanted to get one but i thought it was way overpriced so i borrowed hers, measured it and went to fabric land to find a similar material and made my own.. it was super easy and worked just as well! i love this wrap.. its super comfy for both momma and baby!
That's a great idea I was thinking of doing this too, if it turns out cheaper. I asked the store here for this jersey fabric and it was too expensive. I was going to check US or Canada, but now I guess I'll just buy it since you are saying it was much cheaper.

Your Number One Choice in Carpet, Upholstery & Tile Cleaning in the Alberton, Eldorado Park, Glenanda, La Rochelle and Rosettenville Areas!
We Service The Following Areas…
Do you want your carpets and upholstery looking fresh and new or have a troublesome stain that needs to be removed? Chem-Dry Johannesburg South provides top quality professional cleaning services for your carpets and upholstery.
Our cleaning expertise covers all kinds of carpets and surfaces and will leave your home looking and smelling new.
Chem-Dry’s professional carpet cleaning services always pay close attention to detail when it comes to our client’s needs and their particular cleaning concern. Our work begins with a visit to your business or home by one of our expert carpet cleaning technicians, who will set about determining the correct cleaning treatment for your carpets or rugs as well as their quality and level of wear.
Basic cleaning is usually recommended for light traffic areas with minimum stains on the carpets while deep cleaning is suggested for home-owners who have pets and in higher traffic areas with heavy stains.
Our carpet and upholstery cleaning solutions are safe to use on just about any fibre or fabric and our world famous spot remover is applied to stubborn stains. As an optional extra you may also decide to use Chem-Dry’s Carpet and Fabric Protectant.
When utilized, this water repellent product provides an invisible barrier to help protect against future spills or stains penetrating into your carpets and furniture. What is more this exciting and unique invention can also be used on clothing, shoes, gloves and car interiors.
Most people would be dismayed and shocked if they could see the dirt, grime, hair, dead insects and dust that accumulates at the root of their carpet fibres. However with Chem-Dry around there is nothing to fear. We use a natural carbonating solution which produces millions of tiny bubbles that penetrate deep down into the core of the carpet and lift dirt and bacteria for extraction.
Also unlike steam cleaning, or shampoo cleaning, Chem-Dry’s method causes no harm to flooring, carpets or padding.
Chem-Dry’s efficient and cost effective carpet and upholstery cleaning services have shown us to be one of the leading professional carpet cleaning companies in the Johannesburg area. Our deep cleaning carpet tools combined with our unique non-toxic and environmentally friendly cleaning solutions guarantee you dramatic cleaning results and healthier homes and offices. Years of research has gone into developing state-of-the-art carpet cleaning equipment and cleaning solutions that are tough on stains yet safe to use in your home and around children and pets.
Chem-Dry’s carpet cleaning technicians are highly trained and skilled in identifying different types of fibres and which cleaning methods would suit them best. Chem-Dry Johannesburg South makes it their mission to render professional cleaning of carpets easy and affordable.

The Pats struggled to find their groove against Medicine Hat on Friday, but jumped right back into form Sunday afternoon, fresh off a win in Swift Current on Saturday night.
“I think one of our issues lately is we have been a really inconsistent team,” Pats Captain Adam Brooks explained. “We’ve played really well at times and then other times haven’t played all that great and have given up leads and just not played a complete 60 minute game.”
That was not the case Sunday, however.
Brandon was first on the board with less than a minute left in the first courtesy of Tyler Coulter, but the second period was all Pats.
Josh Mahura scored his second goal in a Pats jersey two minutes into the period to tie the game up. Later on in the period, Dawson Leedahl and Austin Wagner scored 36 seconds apart to bring the Pats up 3-1.
Leedahl scored one more at the end of the second to secure a 4-1 lead for the Pats.
Each team added one in the third period, leaving the final score 5-2.
Head coach John Paddock said the team spent time on the weekend looking at tape from Friday’s loss to show his players what needed to be worked on.
“We’ve created a lot of habits because we’ve won a lot of games on pure skill or the score’s run up because of skill,” Paddock said.” With that you lose your attention to detail and lose attention to the little things.”
In the end, he added, that, and Max Paddock’s strong night in net made the difference.
The 16-year-old goaltender was called up to help when goalies Tyler Brown and Jordan Hollett were injured and proved to be a skilled young tender. In five starts he lost just one game – Friday night’s – and earned the confidence of his teammates. He made 29 saves in the win.
Paddock is expected to go back to his midget team in Brandon this week, as Hollett will be ready to suit up again for this weekend’s road games.
The Pats travel to Calgary this week for a Friday game against the Calgary Hitmen.
Their next home game is on Feb. 4.

When you make serious efforts to eradicate those sins that have become habits in your life, does it seem like you meet up with a brick wall and continually fall into the same traps? I know any time I go to Confession I feel as though I just repeat the same laundry list of sins, receive absolution, do my penance (if one is assigned), and go about the rest of my day knowing that in a few weeks I'll be back in front of the same priest confessing the same sins I've been confessing for years now. Do you, like me, ever wonder what the point of it all is if all we're doing is falling into the same sins over and over and over again? How can we become holy people, saints, if we just keep sinning?
I remember hearing a saying while I was growing up - I don't remember where I heard it from or who said it first, I just remember hearing it. A saint isn't someone who never sins. A saint is someone who gets up and continues the struggle even after they've sinned. Perhaps St. Basil of Poiana Marului said it best in his Commentary on the Book of the Blessed Father Nil Sorsky:
Experience tells us that from time to time strugglers fall either in their thoughts or in their feelings... It is not possible even for the very greatest of men completely to avoid some fault in these daily sins which are not mortal and which consist of words, a thought, ignorance, forgetfulness or being compelled willingly or unwillingly by circumstance.
Even the greatest of men fall daily. The Scriptures tell us that even a righteous man falls seven times a day. Again, the mark of a truly holy person is not whether or not they fall, but what they do when they fall. It seems to me that at every fall we are presented with three possibilities: 1) We despair of ever overcoming sin and give up because we don't think it possible; 2) We choose to just remain in sin and persist in our sins because it is easier than struggling against them; 3) We get up, shake ourselves off, repent, and continue the fight, repenting of our sins and using them as opportunities to learn humility.
Elsewhere in the writings of St. Basil I've read that God often permits these sinful habits to persist in us, lest overcoming them at an inopportune time we become conceited and end up falling into even greater sins. So when you find yourself falling into the same sins over and over again, don't despair. Turn to God in repentance and humility, knowing that in His time He will give you the grace you need to overcome these faults, and that all the while He is preparing you for the day when you do.
Well-timed post. Thanks, for this brother Phillip.Preparation
In a pot in a water bath, heat the sugar to melt it, with the water, chocolate and cocoa. Stir until the sugar completely melts. Separately, beat the egg yolks with a fork and while stirring continuously, add them to the chocolate-cocoa mixture.
After stirring a few more times, remove it from the heat and let it cool. Beat the butter in another container with a mixer until creamy and gradually add batches of the chocolate mixture to it.
Beat with a mixer until you get a smooth buttercream. Use the cream for pastries and cakes.find similar recipes here..

Yes, sleeping is one of them.
(SPOT.ph) After all the parties you've attended, beers downed, and food consumed, you can't help but feel fat after the holiday season. You want to lose the extra weight, but going to the gym is a drag. Is there a more painless way to keep fit? We've come up with fun and stress-free ways to help you lose the holiday weight.
If you find working out to be a monotonous task, maybe you just need to switch it up. You might enjoy the variety of Plana Forma and CrossFit, the relaxation of Yoga, or the downright whimsy of Mermaid Classes.
Take a walk in La Mesa Eco Park
One thing we learned from Wall-E is this: walking around will keep you from getting chubby. For short distances, nix the car or taxi and just go on foot. If you’d like a scenic view, we suggest taking a walk in one of the 10 Manila Parks to Visit.
Going to the club and dancing up a storm can actually help you stay fit. Dancing can burn 150 to 230 calories per half hour depending on your weight. Of course, not everyone knows how to dance, so we recommend checking out videos of these no-brainer dance moves from the Top 10 Dance Crazes in the Philippines.
Rizal Park is on our list of the Top 10 Make-Out Spots in Metro Manila
This is another kind of exercise that no one will grumble about-get intimate with your partner! Kissing burns 68 calories per hour, MOMOL burns 238 calories per half hour, and having sex can burn at least 160 calories per half hour depending on how playful and intense it gets. Who knew working out could be so fun?

Hot foods will not only burn your tongue, but also burn calories. Dishes with chili pepper, or that spicy bowl of ramen , will curb your appetite and speed up your metabolism.
Running or walking on the treadmill is a bore, but zipping throught the shopping mall is something you can do for hours. You’re not only exercising your legs with non-stop walking, but also your arms when you carry loads of shopping bags.
Cafe Ilang Ilang at Manila Hotel has a good selection of small desserts. That counts, right?
The solution for losing weight: eat more! There’s a caveat though, eat more frequently but in small portions. For instance, try having six small meals a day rather than three big meals to control your cravings and avoid overeating. Ideally, we wish we could all eat as much as we’d like, but this isn’t a bad compromise. You might want to check out the SPOT.ph Directory of Buffet Prices. Hey, you can eat small portions at a buffet!
If you notice some of your clothes are looking dated, it’s time to clean out your closet. An added bonus is it will get you moving. Lifting armloads of clothes, reaching for the high shelves (let’s call it stretching), and going back and forth sounds like exercise to us. You’ll work up a sweat and have a well-organized closet to show for it.
Is sleeping a better alternative for losing weight than waking up early to exercise? Sad to say, no. But it will do your body a lot of good. Sleep deprivation will lead you to crave more food, so getting eight hours of sleep will actually make you feel less hungry and weak. This is what we’ll tell ourselves when we skip working out to catch some z’s.
If you’re feeling peckish, don’t forget to couple your meal or snack with a glass of water. It will help you feel full faster and it has zero calories.Aesop Rock Tour Dates Ticketmaster

The selections reflect the Festival’s commitment to explore the world of emerging established artists and provided 10 scholarships to Emerging artists. This year’s festival will feature the Surfside Wine Beer Garden presented by BBC, Live Entertainment at the NightDay Stage, the Ranch Coast Gourmet Marketplace, CVS Silent Auction and Geppetto’s Family Art Center.
The event donates all proceeds to key programs at three area public schools: La Jolla, Torrey Pines, and Bird Rock Elementary. These commonly underfunded programs include art, music, science, physical education, technology, and on-site medical care by a school nurse.

SO SORRY!
Alice Is Dead March 2nd, 2012, 2:47 pmI've been so belated on updating this. Between college starting full time and no scanner and no real WILL to draw... this comic has suffered.
So behold Violet in my latest drawing style; the first thing I've drawn, seriously, in over 6 months!
I'll try to get on top of things again, and upload pages; because I still love this story!
STAY TUNED!The other day, I found (via George Takei) the most hilarious string of reviews on an Amazon product that I’ve ever seen. I was literally crying, these reviews were so well-written and funny. The reviews were for an inflatable unicorn horn for cats… Does it get any better? Apparently Amazon has a whole HOST of hilarious and amazing products. Here are just a few (dozen) that I absolutely LOVED. Here are my top favourites:
The Yodeling Pickle! (Only 1 left in stock!!) Wait, did they actually stock more than one of these? Or are they trying it out on Amazon to see if anyone would ACTUALLY buy a yodeling pickle? Part of me wants to buy it just for the sheer bizareness of it! Apparently, you can buy them used, too. Other people who have had their fill of surprising friends and family by making their pickle yodel are making their used pickle available for others to enjoy!
Remember that dream where you were an octopus, gliding lightly along the bottom of the ocean? You majestically waved your tentacles and explored your watery world, while looking for tasty prey. Now you can do this ON LAND with a set of five-finger tentacles! You can be a bona-fide Pentapus! Get two sets and you can be a Decapus! Get some for your toes and you could be an Icosapus? (I tried googling what twenty would be.. ) Take your tentacles swimming and enjoy the feeling of being a real sea-creature. Wear them to work and suction cup yourself to your coffee – or a co-worker’s face! Climb walls, and crush small animals in your strong tentacular grip!
Save yourself from embarrassing accidents, cover up itchy psoriasis, or just look plain COOL in these epic handerpants gloves! You’ve always wanted the snug feeling of an elastic band around your wrist, and the cool white fabric against your skin is bliss. What’s better than an easy-out pocket for when your middle finger needs to excuse itself? Wear the comforta-bility of 100% polyester against your hands, and let your fingers wave in the wind! There’s no excuse for not having a pair of these. It would be great if I could have my little toes poking out of the snug security of a pair of tighty whities – Please make Feetderpants!
Dental hygiene becoming a bore? Wish you had some flavour to rub between your pearly whites? Mint getting you down?? Accoutrements has the solution for you! Tasty Ranch flavoured dental floss! Spend your morning commute with the tasty flavour of Ranch filling your mouth. No more minty mornings with this product! Mint flavour is a thing of the past. It’s time you enjoyed flossing! Why not prelude Ranch floss time with a little BACON toothpaste? Your brushing and flossing regime will never be the same again!
Everyone loves a narwhal. They are magical and graceful creatures, until they stab you accidentally in the eye with their two-meter long horn… which is not actually a horn, it’s a tooth… growing out of the center of its forehead… GROSS! I digress. Back to the magical fantastical-ness of the narwhal. Personally, I’ve always wanted a narwhal. What a great family pet! You can go on a ride together, spear fish and other sea-creatures together, and crap in the water together (because that’s what water animals do. They crap in the water. It’s really gross). Anyhoodle, I don’t have a pool big enough for a narwhal, and I don’t live close enough to the lake to keep one there, either. And then I found THIS! A complete set of FIVE finger narwhals!!! Reminiscent of the five-finger tentacles, You can have a narwhal of every colour on each finger! Problem SOLVED!
Are you sad now that Popeye’s candy cigarettes have been renamed to Popeyes Candy Sticks, and also that they are nearly impossible to find?? Now you have options! Complete with a realistic-looking yellow-tipped filter, these tasty sticks will help groom you for future habits! No nasty nicotine stains on your fingers, kids! And you won’t come home smelling like an ash tray, either, they’re ORANGE flavoured! Be just like dad!
Quitting smoking and don’t want your super-cool friends to know? FOOL THEM with these realistic candy cigarettes! You might have to discreetly bite off the end of your candy stick so that people actually think you’re smoking… but from a block away, these candy cigarettes could be really convincing to someone you don’t want to know you’re quitting! ACT NOW! Get a pack for everyone in your family. And a case for yourself! NO DUTY or taxes on these babies!!! Smoke all you want (risk of obesity).
August 19, 2013 at 9:34 am
Oh Em Gee. I remember the candy cigarettes when I was little!!! Some gag store sold them and my mom bought them for us! They also had gum cigarettes!
August 19, 2013 at 9:48 am
It’s very difficult to find candy cigarettes in Canada! Something about not encouraging kids to smoke LOL

I haven’t seen them in a long time. Guess you can find anything on the Internet nowadays…Gell’s text Art and Agency is his very sophisticated call for a new type of theory, one that gives agency to objects, although I suppose this is not new for us since we’ve looked at works that start to touch on ideas like these, but regardless, Gell solidifies a concrete methodology for recognizing the power of agency in art, and objects or things. Although some of the diagrams get a little confusing, I think that fact alone shows that these relationships are complex and not as simple as a semiotic understanding would provide us. One of his points and examples that he uses that I like the most is his discussion of the egg and the desire behind it. He writes, “If there were no breakfast-desiring agents like me about, there would be no hens’ eggs (except in the South-East Asian jungle), no saucepans, no gas appliances, and the whole egg-boiling phenomenon would never transpire and never need to be physically explained” (101). I’ve recently looked at concepts of value and the circulation of non-Western art, especially through the work of Nicholas Thomas and Fred Myers, both of who’s work I think relates to Gell and that statement. Myers in particular looks at the new(ish) desires in the Western art world for Aboriginal paintings and artwork from Australia, which affects not only the modes in which people look at the paintings, but also how they are created. The new desire for them will allow for the creation of new forms and ideas, thus demonstrating another aspects of agency, and I suppose desire.

Volume 39 ‘Life Writing – Performing Lives’
LiNQ Volume 39 focuses on life narratives – the stories individuals tell about themselves and others. More specifically, the theme of the issue ‘Performing Lives’ considers autobiographical and biographical stories as constructed ‘performances’ rather than as simple acts of recalling and telling lives. This theme also gestures to the way life writing in print form has, in a technology-saturated era, migrated into other media including film, television, online, theatre, and the gallery. In our call for papers we asked for creative and scholarly work that broadly considered performance both in a literal sense, such as in the theatre, on film and television, as well as in a metaphorical sense. How are identities constructed and narrated in auto/biographically-based stories? How do authors and artists choose to represent themselves? What do they include and exclude? The response to our call revealed the way life narrative and auto/biographical methods have infiltrated approaches to work both inside the academy and out. Below is a selection of works from Volume 39 ‘Life Writing – Performing Lives’. Enjoy.
As we go to press, generation 2.0 takes to the streets in protest against failing governments, economies, and systems. We are witnesses to graphic accounts of civil unrest in places like Tunisia, Algeria and Egypt. Once, news bulletins were controlled by mainstream media and overbearing governments. But nowadays, the bloodshed is immortalised by amateur journalists, albeit often unsteadily framed and out of focus, but graphically real on mobile phones. Streamed on 24-hour mainstream news services, these videos are prefaced by, ‘We can’t vouch for the validity of this footage…but here it is’. Fact morphs into fiction as we struggle to make sense of the world. Iconic news images, like the bloodied corpse of Muammar Gaddafi ’s capture hands holding half a dozen smartphones whose faceless owners are recording, with their professional colleagues, a rough draft of history. Everywhere, the custodians of knowledge are under threat. The mainstream media model is collapsing as well as the rarefied world of the book publisher, who helplessly watches readers fervently embrace the electronic world of books. In the last three years, there has been an explosion in ebook reading on smart phones. So much so write Lachlan Jobbins and Angelo Loukakis on the Australian Society of Authors guide to Digital Self-Publishing, that 2011 may well prove the transition point from print to digital publishing. No longer, they say, will digital publishing be ‘the exotic’ extra. And tellingly, they warn that elements of the future have arrived more quickly than the book industry might have anticipated or predicted.
A place does not exist, Nettie Palmer believed, until it exists “most formidably on paper”, that is except to the people who lived in those places. Littered around the coast of Australia are some tens of thousands of islands small and large, let alone innumerable islands across the globe. Palmer is making an important point about the representations of islands in the literary imaginary. How many islands do have this kind of representative existence beyond those people and creatures that inhabit them? Are all islands linked powerfully in the public imagination with particular writers or academics? Or do we have to struggle a little here and rather is it that Australia’s islands exist most formidably visually through representation by the tourist and entertainment industries? In Australia, narrators have been telling stories about islands long before paper existed; does each island need its own stories, albeit incomplete, as each island has its own dreaming story towards the Murri sense?
Volume 36 ‘Pop Goes the Region’
Last year was our fortieth anniversary issue of LiNQ and a timely reason to revisit the past, take stock, and look to the future, to our changing world where new media has morphed into our lives. It seemed to us time to supplement our paper-based issues, on the world wide web. “Pop Goes the Region” is the theme that best suited this stocktaking moment. As one of Australia’s longest running regional literary journals, we felt it was important to establish an online presence that remained local in focus but global in scope; regional in our commitments but not parochial in perspective; broad-based in our appeal but not pedestrian in approach; literary but not rarified; and expert but not specialised. Pop Goes the Region emerged in consideration of these priorities. Regional writing sometimes gets stamped with the stereotype of “parochial” just as other times it comes into vogue, and is taken up in a sort of precious way by expert critic-curators. Sometimes the fact that the local has a long history of engaging with the popular imagination is forgotten. Certainly with the advent of the internet, the confluence of the regional and the popular must no longer be overlooked. The ways in which popular and metropolitan ideas dominate internet communication can also challenge, and indeed sometimes threaten, ideas about the local and local production. In this global village where we live, technology unites and exposes our regional differences. Yu Xiao’s image “Never Grow Up” on the cover of this year’s edition of LiNQ transcends the local and global, connecting us with an emerging regional artist in China, whose image speaks of the synchronicities between pop and the region.
Volume 35 ‘Country Matters’
The haunting and evocative image we selected for the cover of this issue “Country Matters” emblematises the multiple ways that the themes of this issue — country, landscape and identity — resonate for different Australians. The challenge of finding a single image to represent the many significations of “country” that are taken up in this issue was a significant one, but the cover image we finally selected spoke to us clearly of the regional connotations we sought to convey: that is, the photograph seemed to us to be first and foremost quintessentially North Queensland. On first glance the black and white photograph appears to represent an old-fashioned portrait of a settler and his child implanted somewhat forcefully and literally in the land. Yet, this is a recent photograph, taken in 1983, documenting the protests against the logging of the Daintree Forest. It conveys how the present is often haunted by the past, particularly in colonial and postcolonial settler Australia. To us, this made the image doubly pertinent, unifying themes from both the past and present, showing how Australians relate to the land: from environmental concerns to a sense of a shared or fractious history shaped by the land and the region. Many of the articles, stories, and poems in this issue contemplate how Australians identify with the landscape that shapes them.
Following the appointment of an honorary editorial collective, Volume 34 (2007) marks a new beginning in LiNQ’s thirty-eight-year history. Aspects of the volume nevertheless maintain continuity with the past and with the ideal of connectedness enshrined in the journal’s name.
Volume 33 Number 1 and 2 ‘Earthly Things’
Nietzche’s musical proclivities provide unusual intellectual fodder; our fiction editor gives us a verbal snapshot of Hanoi. The poetry comes from all over the globe and includes translated works as well as poems by writers in prison. There is work by well-established poets – Michael Sharkey and Jeff Guess –among poems by those yet unlauded.

It.
It!
J&A INKED ENTERPRISES Was brought to existence in 2013 by artist and shop owner Abigail and husband Jeff Boivin. The purpose was to work towards bringing the first of many tattoo conventions to the city of Winnipeg.
Winnipeg is one of the most regulated cities in North America with its bylaws and requirements. Abigail, with her extensive industry and process knowledge, teamed with Jeff and his business background and education to work with the city and province to create an accepted operations plan. This will allow us to be able to execute the biggest tattoo convention in Winnipeg to host live public tattooing in a safe, sterile and responsible manner.
In addition to having the ability to get tattooed in a massive public venue we wanted to host a convention that was planned by artists for artists with the focus on artists and the history of the industry. Not the corporate fuelled media image of scripted “tattoo life”.
Artists, art vendors, and enthusiasts populate our planning committee. Our support base for the first year is largely volunteer, and our volunteers are tattoo shop employees, artists, collectors and industry lovers working together to make the Winnipeg Tattoo Show a huge!One weekend my husband recorded a movie that he thought I might like. The movie, Martian Child, starred John Cussack as a recently widowed man who debates going through an adoption that he and his wife had initiated before her death.
In the movie, John Cusack and his newly adopted son, Dennis, work at learning how to live with one another, how to communicate and how to heal their own tender hearts. Dennis believes he is from Mars, hence the title. For Dennis his Martian background is why he has been abandonded by his family. The movie is a lovely story about these two different characters who grow to discover who they are and the family they can make together.
David Gerrold is an award winning writer. He won both the Hugo and Nebula Awards for this book. He has also written for Star Trek, Sliders, Babylon 5, and The Twilight Zone. His other novels include The Man Who Folded Himself and When HARLIE Was One.
The Martian Child, novel is semi-autobiographical. The movie has taken licence and the characters are not the same as in the movie, but they are just as interesting, still capturing your heart.
I don't know which is better, the book or the movie. John Cusack and Bobby Coleman have a wonderful chemistry as father and son. On the other hand, Gerrold's writing is lyrical and really captures the imagination. I guess I'd have to say that this is the case where you want to read the book and watch the movie...even if they are somewhat different.Feb 20, 2011

2018-01-16NEW YORK (CBS 2) — The search is on for a rape and robbery suspect.
The suspect is wanted in a brutal, mid-Thursday afternoon attack where he followed a woman right to her Hamilton Heights apartment.
But what happened after may have left a key clue for investigators to follow.
Police said the brazen rapist, described as a black male in his 30s, was using his victim’s ATM card to score a stash of cash.
“It’s scary, you know, it’s a shame,” Hamilton Heights resident Stacey Milton told CBS 2’s Hazel Sanchez.
At around 1:30 p.m. Thursday, investigators said the attacker followed a 21-year-old woman into her Hamilton Heights building.
Police said the suspect forced his way into the woman’s second-floor apartment, claiming he had a gun. They said the man sexually assaulted his victim, and then grabbed her pocket book, credit cards, cell phone and iPod before fleeing.
The attack has left residents of the neighborhood on edge.
“Rapist walking around, there are criminals – you’ve got to be careful how you get in by yourself,” Yvonne Williams said.
“It really, really bothers me,” another neighbor said. “Of course, it’s very disconcerting to hear that, what happened here – in broad daylight!”
Shortly after the attack, the suspect, wearing a grey, hooded sweatshirt and blue jeans, was caught by surveillance cameras at a nearby deli. Police said he was using his victim’s ATM card.
Jose Reyes lives in the victim’s building. Through a translator, he said he’s concerned for the safety of his neighborhood.
“He said that it’s tough because they grew up on this block and everybody knows everybody, so to hear that, somebody has to do something about it already,” the translator said. “I’m gonna be safe and whomever comes in behind me, if I don’t know where they’re going, I’m not going to let them in the building.”
If you know anything the whereabouts of this suspect, please call the NYPD’s Crime Stoppers Hotline at 800-577-TIPS. The public can also submit their tips by logging onto the Crime Stoppers Web site at or texting their tips to 274637(CRIMES) then enter TIP577.Ingredients:

I have a 2010 Ford Fusion Hybrid with 150k miles and all scheduled maintenance performed on-time. I have a Stop Safely Now light that started intermittently a little over a month ago and is now hard failed.
The first time it happened was 5 weeks ago and I had just returned from a trip out of the country and the vehicle sat 10 days without running. After starting the car I was able to drive about 20 feet at which time I stopped to connect bluetooth and the SSN message illuminated. My first thought was dead or dying battery since I have heard this could cause SSN. I jumped the car and drove without issue for the next two weeks.
Then three weeks ago I got in the car after leaving it parked overnight and drove for about 10 feet before I got SSN. This time I decided to bite the bullet and buy a new 12V battery without testing the installed battery. After installing the new battery I still had the SSN light and I called it a night. Further research shows the 12V battery I removed assuming it was dead was only installed 3 years ago and is likely in serviceable condition.
After letting the car sit overnight with the new 12V battery installed I started it in the morning with no problem and did the fuel trim learning game. I drove with the new battery for 3 weeks with no issues until last weekend.
Now the car has the Stop Safely Now light illuminated on key turn and it will not move under its own power. I used my OBD2 reader to download codes twice.
The first set of codes was downloaded right after the battery change so I am assuming some of the codes are from that:
C1600 - reverse input circuit
C1015 - exhaust gas recirculation sensor B circuit high
U3003 - battery voltage
I cleared these codes after the battery change and I had no engine lights or driving issues until last weekend. I also checked the engineering fault code page on the dash after the battery change and I had no current or historic faults recorded.
Now the car has a OBD2 code C1018 - regen braking and on the engineering fault code page it lists DTC C46200 as a historical fault. Keep in mind I am using a very basic OBD2 reader so it is likely missing some faults.
I have been reading everywhere about the Stop Safely Now issue and it seems to stem from a number of different issues, the most frequent being a coolant pump. I could really use any advice in troubleshooting this issue myself (I am an aircraft mechanic) or relevant manual references. I am trying to avoid a costly stealership repair but I am pretty stuck at this point.
Worth mentioning all of the fuses are in good shape!
Please let me know if you have any questions that would help point in the right direction.Undergraduate Catalog > Fields of Study > Theatre and Media Performance

You see this in the Bronx. The highway development there divides neighborhoods, creates unappealing choke points along crossings, generates excess noise and pollution, breaks up the grid to make it harder for traffic to flow smoothly around obstacles, streams extra cars onto city streets from off the highways, blocks access to waterfront areas, and alters mental geography to make relatively close-by places seem very distant. Northglenn Heating & Air Conditioning, Inc..

[Read before the Auckland Institute, 6th October, 1890.].
Having occasion recently to look up the story of John Rutherford, I thought that additional interest might be imparted to it if it could be illustrated by the native traditions of the circumstances attending his capture, and of any events connected with his enforced residence of nearly ten years among a savage people. As many interesting details of Captain Cook's visit to these parts are still current among the natives, it was to be expected that the capture of the “Agnes,” which occurred forty-seven years afterwards, would be the subject of a tradition quite as circumstantial and as interesting as that relating to the great navigator, especially as this event would acquire additional importance, from the fact that they became possessed thereby of a considerable number of much-coveted firearms. The object of this paper is to place on record the results of inquiries made among the natives, and the conclusions to which they lead.
Rutherford states that he left New Zealand in 1826, and, after a sojourn of nearly a year at Tahiti, and of some further time at Port Jackson and Rio de Janeiro, arrived in England early in 1828. Being himself unable to write, he got a friend to commit the story of his adventures to writing, at his dictation, in the course of the voyage from Rio to England. The substance of this story was published in 1830 by Charles Knight, in “The New-Zealanders,” a volume of the Library of Useful Knowledge, which is said to have been revised and in part written by Lord Brougham. As this book is long since out of print, and now seldom to be met with, I will extract from it such a brief sketch of Rutherford's personal adventures as may suffice for my present purpose.
After several voyages in different parts of the world, Rutherford shipped on board the “Magnet,” a three-masted schooner trading among the islands of the Pacific Ocean. This vessel having put in at Hawaii, in the Sandwich Islands. Rutherford fell sick and was left on that island. Having re-
covered however, in about a fortnight, he was taken on board the “Agnes,” an American brig of six guns and fourteen men, which was then engaged in trading for pearl- and tortoise-shell among the islands of the Pacific. On her return from Hawaii the “Agnes” approached the east coast of New Zealand, intending to put in for refreshments at the Bay of Islands. A gale of wind, however, drove her some distance to the south of the East Cape, and on the 6th March, 1816, she was opposite a large bay which is called Takomardo (or Tokamardo, as spelt on page 274). Being in great need of water, the captain somewhat reluctantly determined, to stand in for this bay, and ultimately came to anchor off the termination of a reef of rocks, immediately under some elevated land which formed one of the sides of the bay. Canoes soon came off from all parts of the bay, paddled chiefly by women, who gave much trouble by their pilfering propensities. In the morning a chief named Aimy came on board in a large warcanoe carrying above a hundred men, and trading proceeded with such vigour that by the close of the day about two hundred pigs had been purchased, with a large quantity of fern-root to feed them on. The captain had also arranged with Aimy that he should take the ship's boat on shore for a supply of water. This having been hoisted on board, the boat was sent again for a further supply, but did not return till the following morning, when the captain paid Aimy for his trouble, giving him two muskets, with a quantity of powder and shot. There were now about three hundred of the natives on the deck, and the captain, being apprehensive for the safety of the ship, ordered the sails to be loosed and preparations to be made for putting to sea as soon as the crew should have had their dinner. Just as this order was being carried out, there being none of the crew on deck excepting the captain and the cook, the natives commenced an attack upon the ship. The captain was killed at once with a tomahawk, and the cook, who ran to his assistance, was despatched in the same manner. The chief mate was next struck down as he came running up the companion-ladder. Four of the crew jumped overboard, but, being picked up by some canoes that were coming from the shore, were bound hand and foot. The rest were soon secured, and all were taken on shore. The ship was then plundered and the cable cut, so that she was soon stranded on the beach, where she was set on fire. Six more of the crew were killed on the following day, and their bodies together with those of the captain, cook, and chief mate, were cooked and eaten.
On the third day Rutherford and his five surviving companions were taken about ten miles inland, to a village which was the residence of a chief named Rangadi, and on the follow-
ing day each of them was stripped of his clothes, and, being laid on his back, was held down by five or six men, and tattooed. At this village Rutherford and four of the others remained for about six months, one of them, named John Watson, having been taken away by a chief, named Nainy soon after their arrival there. After this they set out, in company with Aimy and another chief, to pursue their journey further into the1 interior, one of their number, however, whose name is not given, being left with Rangadi. On their arrival at another village, the chief of which was called Plama, another, whose, name was John Smith, was left with him. When they had travelled about twelve miles further, they stopped at a third village, and here they remained two days. The chief of this village Ewanna, treated them very kindly, and one of the white men, named Jefferson, was left with him. From thence Rutherford and his remaining companion resumed, their journey with Aimy and another chief until they came to Aimy's own village, which thenceforth became their home
The first event of importance which occurred at this place, was the death of Rutherford's companion, more than a year; perhaps, after their arrival, though the time is not distinctly, marked. It occurred on this wise. Aimy and his family went, to a feast at another village a few miles distant, and while, they were away the chief's mother, who had been ailing for some time, died. On Aimy's return there was much discussion as to the cause of the old woman's death. After hearing all the circumstances from the tohunga who had been in attendance on the invalid, an old chief gave it as his opinion that it was clear that the immediate cause of the old lady's death was that she had eaten potatoes which had been peeled, with a white man's knife, after the said knife had been used for cutting rushes wherewith to repair a house; on which ac-count he thought that the white man to whom the knife belonged should be killed. Rutherford ventured to plead for his comrade's life, but it was all in vain. The chief who had pronounced the sentence proceeded to execute it by striking the poor man on the head with his mere, and so killing him.
Rutherford was now left alone among the natives, and, his clothes being all worn out, he had to adopt in his dress the fashions of the country. For the first sixteen months of his residence at Aimy's village he kept a reckoning of days by notches on a stick; but when he afterwards moved about with the chiefs he neglected this mode of tracing the progress of time. At length Aimy proposed, in the presence of the tribe, that he should be made a chief. To this proposal he consented; whereupon his hair was cut in the most approved fashion, his head and his face were adorned with red-ochre and oil, and his newly-acquired dignity was further marked by
presents of some mats and a handsome stone mere. He was invited, moreover, to select a wife from among the marriageable, young ladies of the tribe. His choice fell upon Aimy's daughter, Eshore; whereupon Aimy insisted on his taking her younger sister, Epecka, with her.
Some time after this he took a long journey with the chief Aimy, attended by a suitable retinue. In about a month they arrived at a place called Taranake, on the coast of Cook Strait, where they were received, by Otago, a great chief, who had come from near the South Cape. Here he saw an Englishman named James Mowry, who was the sole survivor of a boat's crew which had been cut off by the natives, had lived eight years among them, and had married Otago's daughter. This man had been well tattooed and made a chief, and had become so thoroughly at home with his people that he had no desire to leave them. He had heard, Rutherford says, of the capture of the “Agnes,” and gave him an account of the deaths of Smith and Watson. “On leaving Taranake,” the story continues, “we took our way along the coast, and after a journey of six weeks arrived at the East Cape, where we met with a great chief named Bomurry, belonging to the Bay of Islands. He told us that he resided in the neighbourhood of Mr. Kendal, the missionary. He had about five hundred warriors with him, and several war-canoes…. They had plundered and murdered nearly every person that lived between the East Cape and the River Thames; and the whole country dreaded the name of Bomurry…. He and his followers having taken leave of us and set sail in their canoes, we also left the East Cape the day following, and proceeded on our journey homewards, travelling during the day and encamping at night in the woods. In this way we arrived in four days at our village.”
In the course of time another important expedition was undertaken, the account of which shall be given mainly in Rutherford's own words: “One day a messenger arrived from a neighbouring village with the news that all the chiefs for miles round were about to set out in three days for a place called Kipara, that had been made with the chiefs in our neighbourhood.” After describing the preparations for the journey, the narrative continues: “We were five weeks in reaching Kipara, where we found, about eleven
hundred more natives encamped by the side of a river. On the opposite side of the river—which was about half a mile wide and not more than 4ft. deep in any part—-about four hundred of the enemy were encamped, waiting for reinforcements.” With these people was a white man, “who,” says Rutherford, “told me that his name was John Mawman, that he was a native of Port Jackson, and that he had run away from the ‘Tees’ sloop-of-war while she lay at this island. He had since joined the natives, and was now living with a chief named Rawmatty, whose daughter he had married, and whose residence was at a place called Sukyanna, on the west coast, within fifty miles of the Bay of Islands.”
An account of the engagement then follows: “Early the next morning the enemy retreated to 10 yards to the rear. The two bodies then advanced to within 100 which did not belong to the
heads they had cut off. The engagement had not lasted many minutes when the enemy began to retreat, and were pursued by our party through the woods. In a short time our party returned victorious, bringing along with them many prisoners. One of our chiefs had been shot by Shungie, and the body was brought back, and laid upon some mats before the huts, The name of this chief was Ewanna. He was one of those who were at the taking of our vessel. There were, besides Ewanna, five other chiefs killed on our side, whose names were Nainy, Ewarree, Tometooi, Ewarrehuru, and Erow. On the other side three chiefs were killed — namely, Charley, Shungie's eldest son, and two sons of Mootyi, a great chief of Sukyanna.”
After this the party left Kipara in a number of canoes, and proceeded down the river to a place called Shaurakke (or Showrackee), from whence they returned to their respective homes. It was only a few days after their return that a vessel was announced off Tokamardo. It was arranged that Rutherford should go on board first to throw the captain off his guard, that the natives might the more easily seize the ship and murder the crew. As soon, however, as Rutherford had gone on board he warned the captain of his danger, persuaded him to put to sea again at once, and to take him with him. Thus, Rutherford says, he made his escape on the 9th January, 1826, after he had been ten years on the island all but two months.
The narrative an outline of which I have now given-is illustrated by many details of the manners and customs of the people, which are told in such a way as to leave a favourable impression on the reader and to enlist his sympathy. The bay which is mentioned as the scene of the capture of the “Agnes” is placed some distance south of the East Cape. The short description given of it does not fix the locality decisively, nor yet does the statement that the vessel came to anchor “off the termination of a reef of rocks immediately under some elevated land which formed one of the sides of the bay.” The writer of the book to which I am indebted for the narrative, comparing this description with that of Poverty Bay given by Captain Cook, concludes without hesitation that this is the place intended, and his conclusion is accepted by other writers. The name Tokamardo, however, suggests at once the bay, about thirty-five miles from the East Cape, which is called by the natives Tokomaru, and answers fairly to the description given in the narrative. The position, too, assigned to Aimy's village suits this locality, and there can be little doubt that Tokomaru, and not Poverty Bay, is the place intended. But it matters little which of the two we decide upon when we find that the
natives have no tradition whatever of any such event as the capture of the “Agnes” and the murder of the greater portion of the crew having ever taken place anywhere in this part of New Zealand. The arrival of a ship for the purpose of trading, and the acquisition of firearms, to say nothing of the Capture of the ship and the slaughter of the crew, were event which would be much talked about in those days, and would not readily be forgotten. Besides, what we know of the people both before and since this alleged occurrence makes it extremely improbable that anything of the kind should ever have happened. It is true that the people whom Cook encountered at Poverty Bay were hostile; but when they found, from his treatment of the three youths whom he captured, that he had no desire to injure them, they were disposed to be very friendly, one of the first to come peaceably on board the ship as they were leaving the bay being recognized as one of the very men who were so exceedingly troublesome two days before. At Anaura, too, and at Tolaga Bay, a few miles-distant from Tokomaru, the people could not possibly have been more kindly disposed, though they were well aware of what had occurred only a few days before at Poverty Bay And only three years after 1826, the date which Rutherford gives for his escape, we find that there was a brisk trade-carried on all along this coast, the natives being everywhere engaged in the production of flax, which they bartered principally for firearms and ammunition. The articles required for this trade were supplied by Sydney merchants to their agents, who lived among the natives, and were always treated by them with the greatest possible consideration and kindness. The natives tell of three white men, whom they knew by the names of Riki, Punga, and Tapore, who lived for some time-among them before the days of the flax trade; but these men came and went of their own accord, and the circumstances of their sojourn in the district do not in the least correspond with those in which Rutherford places himself.
It is to be noticed that Rutherford mentions no names of places in the neighbourhood of Tokamardo. He purports to give the names of several chiefs, but none of these can be-identified with any of the names of chiefs now living, or of those of the generation which has recently passed away.
Another remarkable circumstance is that he does not make the slightest allusion to the ravages which were made in the district by the Ngapuhi Tribe, from the Bay of Islands, under the notorious chief Hongi. After Hongi's return from England in 1821, two expeditions were made by this tribe into these parts—the first, under Hongi himself, in 1823, and the second, under Pomare, two years later. The former was most disastrous to the people of Waiapu and the neighbouring parts,
whose spears and meres were a very inadequate defence against the firearms of their assailants. Every pa that was attacked was taken with great slaughter, and the survivors, to the number of many hundreds, were carried off as slaves. There was great consternation throughout the district, and numbers of the people hid themselves away in their mountain fastnesses until their much-dreaded invaders had departed. The southernmost pa taken by the Ngapuhi was only about five miles distant from Tokomaru, and from this point they retraced their steps and returned home. Pomare likewise came as far south as Tokomaru, but he treated all the people to the south of the East Cape as friends, and formed a matrimonial alliance with them, taking as his wife Te Rangiipaia, daughter of Te Porioterangi. Rutherford mentions Pomare as being near the East Cape, on his way home, when he and his friends returned from their visit to Taranaki; but of Hongi's invasion he does not say a word. And yet, of all the events which disturbed the monotony of everyday life during those ten years, there could have been nothing to be compared with this. It is impossible that any one who was well acquainted with the circumstances of the district at the period in question should, in relating the principal occurrences of those years, pass over such a calamity as this without the slightest allusion.
The last event of importance in Rutherford's narrative is the expedition to Kaipara to take part in the war with Hongi; but the natives of the part of the country from which this expedition is said to have started have no knowledge whatever of anything of the kind. The account, too, which, he gives of the battle makes it very doubtful (to say the least) whether he was present at it, as he represents himself to have been; for he gives the victory to the wrong side. The Kaipara people and their friends, who were opposed to Hongi, were successful in the early part of the engagement, but were afterwards beaten with great slaughter, and fled to Waikato, whither Hongi followed them to avenge the death of his son.*
A close examination of the whole narrative leads very decidedly to the conclusion that Rutherford's account of his personal adventures is a mere romance; that he knew nothing of the locality in which he professes to have resided nearly ten years, beyond the name of Tokomaru; and that, whether the years which he spent in New Zealand were many or few, they were spent in the north, somewhere in the neighbourhood of the Bay of Islands.
But what, it may be asked, could be the object of such a fabrication ? To this question I can only suggest a possible
[Footnote] * For the particulars of this battle, and its results, see the “Life of Henry Williams,” by Hugh Carleton, vol. i, p. 64, note.
answer. It may be that Rutherford was a deserter from one of those ships which, in the early days, so often visited the northern part of the island for the purpose of procuring kauri spars. Supposing this to have been the case, it would be an object of supreme importance with him that he should escape detection; and it would be a great help to him in securing this object if he could induce the natives among whom he found a home to confer upon him the honour of a tattooed face; and it would be with the same object in view that he concocted the plausible story of the capture of the “Agnes,” and of his forcible detention in a distant part of the country, to account for his appearance on his emerging once more into the civilized world.Hotels in Tallaght, Ireland

When to visit TallaghtWondering when's the best time to visit? Here are seasonal norms to help you plan your trip:Today I’m blogging one of the very first weddings of the season, back in December – Sarah & Jay at the Goose in Busselton. The Goose is a gorgeous beachfront restaurant/bar right on the Busselton foreshore, at the base of the Busselton jetty. They are winding back their weddings though and Sarah & Jay were one of the lucky last couples to enjoy a wedding at the venue.
The Goose provided white folding chairs for the ceremony, which we set up to the couple’s specifications. Sarah had originally asked for our glass jars to hang off the sides of the chairs, with flowers in each jar. This wasn’t possible on the day as the chairs provided by the Goose were a lot lighter than our Gladiator chairs, and the weight of the water in the jars was tipping the chairs over. We couldn’t do without water as it was such a hot day the flowers would have been dead in minutes! So we improvised, and an eclectic mix of jars lined the aisle.
The bride organised with her florist to keep the spares from the bouquets, and along with some extra bunches of flowers I then had enough to create a very rustic arrangement in each glass jar. I am by no means a qualified florist and would never agree to do a bouquet but am very happy to do something like this if there is time permitting on the day.
Our arch looked great and framed the gap in the wall between the grassy area where the ceremony was held and the beach really well. This grassy section near the Goose is actually Busselton Shire land so as long as you apply for a permit, you can still get married there. The bride provided the wicker love hearts to add something special to the arch.
As mentioned, it was a bloody scorcher! The ceremony was mid-afternoon and there was little to no shade at the venue. Luckily, we brought along our white parasols as well as an ice bucket load of chilled water which guests took full advantage of.
Our little elegant vintage signing table completed the picture, adorned with a glass jar with some flowers matching the ones down the aisle. After the ceremony, I packed up all the chairs and returned them to the Goose, then moved all my lovely flower jars inside to place on the tables for the reception.
For some gorgeous professional photos of this gorgeous wedding, please head to Envy Photography’s blog at but here is a few more to keep you going until then…Clinton Mayor Lew Starling will see his seventh term expire this year and, expressing his desire to see Sampson’s seat continue to grow and improve, is seeking his eighth.
Elected in 2001, Starling has seen a great deal of progress in Clinton, including a downtown that has flourished on the strength of several revitalization projects and numerous new businesses. Still, there is more to do, the mayor imparted after signing the dotted line to seek re-election to a post he has held for nearly 14 years.
“We have a lot more to be done in the city,” Starling stated Monday. “I think we have made good progress in cleaning up the town and trying to rehabilitate the downtown. We still have some more work to do and we have a lot of work to do now that the Great Recession is over in trying to rehabilitate some of the neighborhoods as well, and we will be working on that.”
The focus will remain on attracting jobs and businesses to Clinton, he said.
“With the economy the way it’s been, it’s been difficult to do things. We’re having more interest now than we’ve had but there’s just a lot of work left to be done,” Starling attested. “I love Clinton and I want to make it a better place to live. I just see more things that need to be done that I would like to work with the Council to get accomplished.”
That Council includes members Steve Stefanovich, Maxine Harris, Marcus Becton, Jean Turlington and Neal Strickland, all of whom have held their respective positions for more than a decade. Along with the mayoral post, the Council seats occupied by Strickland (District 2) and Turlington (District 4) are expiring. The mayor is elected every two years in Clinton, Council members every four.
Strickland and Turlington filed for re-election within moments of each other last Monday, the first day of the 10-day filing period. Both said they were excited about the prospect of returning to the board, commenting on the synergy of the elected group.
“The Council works very well together,” Starling stated. “While we may debate an issue or agree to disagree, the Council works very well together and everybody has the same interest in mind, and that is bettering the town. We rarely have a split vote, we rarely have a dissenting vote because we debate everything and City Council is just not going to do or approve anything that is not in the best interest of the city, period.
“We’re excited about trying to grow and continue to improve the city,” he said.
Just last week, Starling was with Gov. Pat McCrory, who talked about the importance of the state’s cities. The governor said when representatives of a business or industry make a trip to the state to possibly set down roots, those industry leaders often request to go to that particular county’s seat “because that is the hub,” the mayor said.
“That is sort of a reflection on how the county is doing. Are we letting our downtown die or are we keeping it up?” Starling noted. “He was saying that even when somebody doesn’t live inside the city, they come there to transact business and it needs to be a shining star.”
Clinton shines, Starling said, but it is the constant goal to make that gleam brighter.
“We’re so excited about the rebirth that we have,” the mayor said, “and the Council is just biting at the bit to continue to try to implement these programs. We have a lot of things we want to do, but truthfully, growth and budget have been a constraint. We’re hoping that with the new N.C. 24 and some other things we see on the horizon we can implement a lot of these things that will help the citizens.”
A push toward multi-use development in the downtown, notably the inclusion of second-story residential units in downtown Clinton, is one of Starling’s main goals.
“I’d like to see people living downtown, I’d like to see upstairs condos,” the mayor asserted, saying that currently city officials are conducting research and providing necessary support to property owners to bring that to fruition. “We’re encouraged by people who want that. I think that would really change the dynamics of downtown to have people living down there. Just about every building downtown has a huge upstairs and I think to make some of these buildings residences as well — like you see in Raleigh and other towns — would add something to our downtown.”

’s always rumors about Blake Shelton but this one scares me, he hinted that he might be retiring soon!

While many took the tweet as a possible sign that Blake is hanging his cowboy hat up soon, we did some digging and that would be highly unlikely because he just signed a deal with Warner Music Nashville, basically proving he’s still committed to making music with his long time label.

Various fan derivations ahead of the truly terrible, sickening second season.
Terrible news, dear readers: Netflix have granted A Series Of Unfortunate Events a second season.
It was announced via a teaser video that contained clues leading to the website vastlyfrighteningdecision.com, where Lemony Snicket laments: "Even as we speak, set builders, costume designers and trauma specialists are snapping into action, the better to bring you even more upsetting episodes, all because of your reputed enthusiasm for this grim example of so-called family programming."
The show aired its eight-episode first season back in January, earning a wave of critical acclaim despite the content contained within each unsettling instalment. It's no surprise, then, that Netflix have ordered another season - and indeed, more episodes, with the next run consisting of 10 episodes, tackling the next five books in the series: The Austere Academy, The Ersatz Elevator, The Vile Village, The Hostile Hospital, and The Carnivorous Carnival.
It promises further tales of misery and woe for the poor Baudelaire orphans, greater schemes from the nefarious Count Olaf, and a building of the mysteries that were layered throughout the first season. Naturally, as with any show that has a built-in audience and offers up mysteries, people have made some very fine deductions, and offered up plenty of terrible, terrifying theories.

Water dripped from her form, clinging to the curves of her breasts as Adriana rose from the center of the pool. A light breeze played across the surface of the water, lifting small ripples into points as she moved toward the shore. Goose flesh rose across her skin as the breeze touched her wet and naked form, yet she did nothing to ease the chill that seeped into her form.
“I don’t understand how you can do that to yourself.” The words filtered out from behind the thick trunk of a tree as the woman who laid claim to it stepped into line of sight. “The cold must be enough to steal your breath away, yet you spend every chance you get neck deep in a pool or river.”
Adriana smiled as she moved through the water, lingering in the reeds for a moment. The sand moved beneath her feet, burying itself between her toes as she shifted her weight, trailing one hand over the surface of the pool. “Bathing is relaxing, you should try it sometime, for something other than getting clean.” Was she the only one among her sisters who found that soaking cleared her mind?
No, she couldn’t be. Her mother enjoyed it as well, though she seldom wandered far from their home and preferred the bathing chamber if for no other reason than to silence wagging tongues.
“In hot water, maybe.” The other female snorted, her top lip curled in disgust. “Where we have attendants who will provide clean linen, in a room warmed by fire or brazier, but out here?” She shook her head, her long dark curls brushing over her shoulders with the movement. “This is foolish. You will become chilled to the bone and then what? Will you become sick as well?”
“No.” She rarely felt the cold.
“I don’t understand why you do this, why the cold doesn’t bother you the same as it does everyone else.”
“Perhaps it’s the nymph blood?” Adriana teased as she stepped out of the water. Did they all think her strange? Of course they did, she wasn’t the same as they were, though many carried magic from other sources, their family lines mingled with human and magic touched races alike. Yet her differences were closer to the surface, despite the fact that she had been born into the line of Lilith.
And that is why they watch me.
“Please don’t say that, there are enough in the family who already think you tainted by your mother’s blood.”
A flicker of a frown creased Adriana’s brow but she forced her features back into the calm smile she habitually wore. “She has never denied the stories, that her family line held a touch of the nymph before she was changed.” Odd how others in her family had a problem with her blood line when that magic infused blood was the very reason her mother had survived the turn and then had been able to give birth to a vampire daughter. “We all have something within our family line that isn’t quite vampire. Yet that is forgiven or forgotten when we are turned, or that is how it is supposed to be.” Even as she spoke she knew life wasn’t like that, her people, the daughters of Lilith, were proud of their background, their ties to Lilith.
“No, but it would have made your life a lot easier if she had denied it, or at least not engaged others when they spoke of her birth. Yes, she is one of us now, just as you are, born and reborn into the line of Lilith, but she will not forget where she comes from, what she was before she was turned. She revels in her ability to use water, to spin it to her whims, use it as a weapon against others. She even uses it against those who are members of her family. She is foolish and because of that she will never rise within the family. Never become more than a daughter of low rank.” The woman at the edge of the pool sighed and held out a large piece of linen. “Please, it’s time you stepped out of the pool. You’re making me feel cold.”
Adriana arched an eyebrow. How could she feel cold when she was doing nothing but standing there, holding a piece of cloth out? No, that wasn’t a conversation she was about to get into, not when it would be a waste of time. The words were, no doubt, another way of trying to convince Adriana that she was being foolish by openly admitting the nymph blood that tainted her being. Silently she stepped out of the last of the water and into the waiting drying linen, closing her eyes as the cloth was draped around her damp form.
“We need to hunt.” Liliana announced, her words clipped.
“You need to hunt but I know where my prey waits for me.” Adriana opened her eyes, smiled and reached for the cloth, holding it against her body. “It is you that has no source easily to hand.” She glanced over at the other woman. Was it wrong to want to lord it over Liliana? Perhaps, yet Liliana had done it to her time and again. “His pack will not come to you, but this one will come for me soon. I can feel it, the pull between us, Liliana.”
Liliana scowled and stepped back away from the water, her shoulders stiff, arms folded beneath her breasts. “You’re mistaken, they will come to me, all I have to do is send out the call and one or more of his pack will willingly give me their veins. They are, after all, but males and sex is something that will tempt them.” The woman looked back at her. “Not that they will be allowed to touch me. I would not waste the chance of a daughter on sex with a beast.”
“A beast?” Adriana arched an eyebrow.
“Shifters are one step away from animals and if their blood did not carry the magic that feeds us, I would have nothing to do with the filthy creatures.” Liliana scowled, her voice cold. “Nor would you if you had any sense.”
“They shift their shape, so they’re animals to you?”
“Yes, what else could they be? Male beasts fit only for food or work.”
Is that what Liliana truly thought about the males they fed from? Not that they fed only from males, but Liliana preferred that as her choice of meal. Females, after all, deserved better after the way they were treated by their own kind or the sons of Caine. At least, that was the excuse Liliana, and those like her, used. It wasn’t something Adriana could understand. Just as she found fault with the idea that males were foolish. Yes, there were issues, and those of their own species who were sworn to the service of Caine were a true problem, but not all males were like that.
Just as not all daughters of Lilith felt that males were nothing more than a food source, or brute labor.
“Your male will need some taming if you would use him more than once.” Liliana shrugged as she stepped back, casting her gaze over the trees. “Shifters are a dangerous, brutal lot who seldom listen. It would be better for all of us if they were under the control of our kind instead of allowed to run free, ruling lands of their own. Perhaps, in time, the elders will see sense and allow us to tame these creatures.”
“Even the women?” Adriana tugged her tunic from a nearby branch and pulled it over her head.
“They’re little more than animals.”
Adriana caught her bottom lip between her teeth, taking a moment to put her thoughts into order. Was it worth the energy to fight with Liliana? She glanced over at the other woman and shook her head. No, it wouldn’t matter what she told Liliana, the woman’s beliefs wouldn’t change. She, like so many others, saw the other magic users as nothing more than a source of food and brute labor. That was a mistake, but women like Liliana would never believe that, no matter how often they were told otherwise. Instead they clung, willingly, to the ideas passed down by those who would happily reduce all magical creatures except vampires, to nothing more than slaves.
The inclusion of the female shifters in all of this was new. What had happened to Liliana?
Even as she tried to find the right words, ones that would allow her to find out what had changed her companion, Liliana lashed out with another verbal attack.
“You’re weak, Adriana. Weak and foolish if you think they could ever be our equals. We drink from them, we use them, how could they be equal to us?”
Fury rose, tightening her skin as she smoothed down the tunic and took a step toward the other woman. “I am not weak.”
“Yes, you are, and one day you’ll realize that, hopefully before you make a mistake that will cost you your life.”
Adriana closed her eyes and counted under her breath. Anger wouldn’t help her, rage would lead to mistakes and there was a man who would be waiting for her before the moon set and the sun crept its way into the sky. “And you continue to try and change my behavior. One would almost think that you’ve been told to do this, that someone else has set you at my side as my teacher.” She paused long enough to put her thoughts and words into order, taking care to keep her tone calm. Liliana was powerful, most of the daughters of Lilith were, but her magic, the energy she tapped and used, was stronger than almost anyone else Adriana had ever known. Yet she lacked discipline, at least discipline she could claim as her own instead of the structures set in place through her own discoveries.
Blind. Obedient.
No, it was more than that, she knew what she was doing, wanted to please the other women in their home, and she used those connections she built in order to secure her place within the family.
I could do the same thing. Follow the unwritten rules and work my way through the ranks of my sisters until I stand side by side with women like Liliana.
It would be more than that, she’d become the next lady if she followed their rules, all of those rules. Yet that wasn’t who she was, not in her heart.
“Would it be so wrong to help you see the error of your ways? You wouldn’t be the first daughter of Lilith to be mistaken in their beliefs, nor the first to find out how the world truly works and seek redemption.” Liliana smiled, though it didn’t reach her eyes. “If you can’t adapt, if you can’t accept everything that is a part of how we live, then you will one day find that you are no longer welcome among your sisters and even your mother will be unable to help you.”
Horror chilled Adriana to the bone. Was this what was going on then? Her family wanted rid of her or was it more likely a small number within their family who had banded together to make this threat? Either way, it left Adriana sickened and fighting to keep her reaction from showing. “Perhaps that will happen, or perhaps others within our family will see the error of their ways and realize that those with magic in their blood are far more than mere food.”
Laughter filled the small glade as Liliana took a step toward Adriana, power radiating from Liliana as she spread out her fingers, arms lifted from her sides, energy crackling between her fingers. “If you truly believe that, then you are a fool, sister mine. You will learn, the hard way. Oh, I had hoped you would learn the error of your ways, but you still hold onto your beliefs.”
Adriana closed her eyes for a heartbeat, tapping the power that rolled through her body. The water, it was close enough that she could use it as a weapon, one that she knew Liliana lacked the ability to deflect. Calm and focused she opened her eyes, fixing her gaze on the woman who was a sister in all but blood. “Would you strike me down, Liliana? Is that why you come with me, to see if it was time to attack me?”
Liliana arched an eyebrow, her full lips twisted into a cruel smile. “Why else would I be here?”

Use good judgment before killing any living thing. Killing without just cause does honor to no one. – Hwarangdo Warriors Code of Honor
On May 1, 2011, an elite team of Navy SEALS attacked the compound of Osama Bin Laden, killing him. It is said that he showed no sign of surrendering, or he would have been taken captive. His body was removed to a Navy ship. He was washed, wrapped in white cloth and buried, with appropriate Muslim ritual, at sea.
Generally, it is preferred that Muslims be buried in the area where they died, preferably in a Muslim cemetery, shrouded in white and lying on their right sides, facing Mecca, within 24 hours of death. Burial at sea is allowed under certain circumstances.
Certainly Osama bin Laden was the enemy, both of Islam and of the United States of America. Killing him was done with cause, and he was treated with the honor that should be accorded a powerful adversary.
One might call what happened a pragmatic, best-under-the-circumstances decision. Clearly, he had caused the deaths of many thousands of people. He admitted it, and bragged about it. Capture and trial would have been extremely risky, as would holding him as a prisoner of war. Burial on land opened the possibility of creation of a shrine that would lead to more violence.
Osama bin Laden did more harm to Islamic people that he did to the rest of the world. More Muslims have been killed than Christian Caucasians; and, worse, his teaching created for the world a distorted view of his religion. Many people, certainly in the United States, now believe that all Muslims are our enemies. Many believe that the killing of innocents, and acts such as suicide, follow the teachings of Islam. Many believe that Mohammad exhorted his followers to kill non-Muslims, and that the reward for death in pursuit of this goal would a very fine time in heaven.
We’ll never know whether this man believed the virulent nonsense that he taught, or whether followers of Sharia law actually believe that hobbling a woman with a Burka, or killing her if someone rapes her, is the word of God as taught through the religion of Islam. Those of us who know even a little about the religion know that these beliefs do not reflect, by a country mile, the core teachings of Islam.
It doesn’t really matter whether bin Laden was in his heart a person of principle, or a person of evil.
An honorable warrior treats his enemy with fairness and decency, no matter what their character.
For this, I applaud President Barack Obama. He authorized the killing. He treated the body with respect. He has not released photos of the body, and we can only hope he never does. There is no reason, given the presence of DNA proof, for anyone to see them, even top U. S. officials. They should be destroyed.
Any conspiracy theorist, who wishes to deny the death of this instigator of hatred and murder, is welcome to try to find him.
In two instances has President Obama, with whom I usually disagree, acted in a clear, decisive manner in regard to the security of our country and our citizens. The first was in authorizing the killing of the Somali pirates holding an American ship captain hostage. The second was the killing and burial of Osama bin Laden.
It is said that Pakistan is angry with us for performing this mission within their borders. In truth, this is what we should be doing, and should have been doing in response to terrorist attacks over the past 20 years. All nations should be put on alert by us, and informed that we will do the same any time we find a terrorist leader within their borders and can‘t trust them to cooperate.
We should focus on finding terrorists and rooting them out, demonstrating our strength, and our commitment to personal freedom for all people throughout the world. The savings, both in human lives and in money spent, would be enormous.
It is not our job to create democracy throughout the world. It is our job to stand for personal freedom and security for all. It is our job to protect ourselves with minimal risk, at minimal cost and with minimal loss of life and infrastructure in other countries.
For once, we found the enemy and vanquished him. Now, let him sleep in peace, and leave him to God.Wednesday, June 22, 2005

Monzoor Hussain, Lindsey Clark, Arshad Hussain, Hardeep Saini and Razwan Faraz were all senior leaders at PVET, which ran Park View Academy, Nansen Primary and Golden Hillock School.
The schools are among five in Birmingham plunged into special measures in April last year following an alleged plot by hardline Muslims to take control of governing bodies.
Giving evidence, the former Nansen head - referred to as ‘Witness C’ - claimed things changed in 2011 when it was decided the school should convert to an academy sponsored by PVET and Tahir Alam joined the governing body. Mr Alam was last month banned by the Department for Education from any involvement in schools for ‘undermining British values’.
Witness C said: “From that moment on there was constant bullying and harassment from all sides and I felt no one was listening to me. There were different agendas from everyone, from the governing body, Lindsey Clark and her team and the religious aspect of it.”
She claimed she was suspended by Ms Clark - former executive principal at PVET - in October 2012 when it was discovered the school’s fire alarm was not working properly and there was no evacuation procedure in place.
Witness C added: “When I was suspended I felt a great sense of relief that I was finally able to get out of the situation in which I had been bullied, harassed and intimidated.
“I decided I could not return to the school. I have never returned to education. The whole ordeal was traumatic and upsetting and it has taken me a long time to recover.”
Meanwhile, her witness statement said the governing body had left her feeling “undermined” and that they “wanted her gone”.
She said that in 2010 she moved the school from one that held Islamic assemblies to one with “multi-faith” ones. Her evidence claimed the move was strongly opposed by Monzoor Hussain, who was a governor at Nansen at the time as well as assistant headteacher at Park View.
She claimed two years later the governing body voted at a meeting she did not attend to reintroduce Islamic assemblies and Friday prayers. But she said the school did not have the facilities to cope with the prayer sessions.
“It was brought to my attention that there was chaos in the toilets because the children were trying to do ablution (act of washing themselves) before prayer and the school did not have the facilities to accommodate this,” she added.
“I found it astonishing that young children in a British state school were being encouraged to take part in Islamic prayer during the normal school day.
“I had never been asked about Friday prayers and I felt that if I challenged them I would have dug myself into a deeper hole and I would have been seen as a Muslim who is not religious and therefore considered unsupportive.
“I believe the responsibility of religion lies at home.”
The former headteacher criticised the selection of Razwan Faraz to the role of deputy head at Nansen in 2012, claiming he was not her preferred choice as he was “a bit green” and did not have strong enough leadership skills.
She claimed members on the recruitment panel, including Monzoor Hussain, were “good friends” with Razwan and had been seen leaving a restaurant with him just days before his interview for deputy headship.
She added: “Those who wanted to appoint Razwan, including Monzoor, were completely determined that he got the job and would not listen to my reasoning.”
Representing Monzoor Hussain, barrister Andrew Faux, said Witness C had applied for the school’s denomination to change from holding Islamic to multi-faith assemblies without consulting governors or parents - despite claiming the opposite on an application form to officials.
He claimed the governing body only “woke up” to the change two years later in 2010.
Claire Darwin, representing Razwan Faraz, added: “The law requires pupils to undertake collective worship at all state schools, no matter what faith.”
She said there were still Christian assemblies held at the predominantly Muslim school, and Razwan had sent Witness C an email urging her to ensure their quality were on a par with Islamic assemblies.
She said the recruitment panel had also selected a white non-Muslim teacher to a second role as deputy head and he was their top choice over Razwan.
She added: “This wasn’t a panel selecting candidates based on their religion or ethnicity.”
She also denied Razwan was good friends with any of the panel and insisted he had not gone to a restaurant with any of them ahead of his interview.
The teachers all deny the allegations and the hearing continues.Reversible Navy Arrow Rug

This Dessert Is So Out Of This World It Arrived In A Spaceship
If you’re a fan of apples, you’re going to like this cobbler. If you’re also a fan of snickerdoodles, you’re going to love this even more! That’s right – this dessert combines the two all-time favorites into one incredible treat you wish you didn’t have to share (you could always try to hide this from your family but the amazing aromas are a dead giveaway).
When I came across this recipe over at Butter With A Side Of Bread, I immediately knew this was going to become my new favorite. What is there not to love? Beautifully softened apples, with that cinnamon-sugary snickerdoodle crust on top… It’s a symphony of dessert flavors, I tell ya!
This cobbler is also the perfect dessert for get-togethers and parties; the recipe makes 15 servings, unless you’re like me and get a double serving right off the bat! The hardest part is to let this cool for a few minutes until you drizzle it with some caramel… My mouth is watering, just thinking about it!

The Nigerian economy attracted a total investment inflow of $4.14bn in the third quarter of this year, the National Bureau of Statistics has said.
The NBS, in its capital importation report, which was released on Monday, said the investment inflow in the third quarter was a significant improvement over the $1.79bn and $908.26m recorded in the second and first quarters of this year, respectively.
So far, a total investment of $6.85bn has been attracted into the economy this year.
The NBS noted that this was the first time since the beginning of 2015 that investment inflows would hit over $4bn in a quarter.
The report explained that the increase in investment inflow was as a result of significant growth in both portfolio and other categories of investments.
It read in part, “The capital importation into Nigeria in 2017 Q3 recorded a substantial increase compared to the past few quarters, as the economy continued to recover from recession following its exit in Q2 2017.
“The total capital imported in the third quarter was recorded at $4.14bn, more than double the inflow in the second quarter of this year, representing an increased value of 147.5 per cent on a year-on-year basis.
“The boom in capital importation in Q3 2017 was mainly driven by significant growth in both portfolio investment and other investment.”
A breakdown of the investment inflow showed that portfolio, with $2.76bn, remained the largest component of the capital imported into the country, contributing about 67 per cent of the total amount.
Portfolio investment, according to the report, expanded faster than the other categories with a year-on-year growth rate of 200.7 per cent.
The report stated that foreign domestic investment recorded a total amount of $117.6m, representing a 65.5 per cent decline.
It added, “The total amount of foreign direct investments during the quarter was recorded at $117.6m, which declined by 57.14 per cent compared to the previous quarter and 65.48 per cent compared to 2016 Q3 due to the fall in both equity and other capital investment.
“This category of capital investment showed a surprising decrease in value when both portfolio investments and other investment grew strongly over the third quarter.
“Capital import in the form of equity recorded $117.5m and remained the majority of total FDI in the third quarter of 2017, while other capital fell from $0.3m to $0.13m from the second to the third quarter.”

Five Reasons to Give Yourself the Holiday Gift of Long-Term Care Insurance
This Holiday Season Could Be the Merriest Ever Says Long-Term Care Specialist Larry Heinert of ACSIA Partners LLC
Papillion, NE December 12, 2014 – If you’re 50-plus, Larry Heinert has some holiday advice for you. “Consider giving yourself the gift of long-term care insurance,” Heinert says. “It just might lift your spirits during the gift-giving season.” Heinert, a NE-based agent of ACSIA Partners LLC, is an expert in long-term care planning.
There are 5 reasons why you might enjoy the holidays more if you secure LTC insurance this month, according to Heinert.
1. Asset Protection. “With insurance available to pay for care, you’ll breathe easier knowing you’ve protected your retirement assets,” Heinert says. “Your savings and equity won’t be as vulnerable to unexpected care costs.” This knowledge alone can make December more enjoyable, Heinert points out.
2. Lifestyle Protection. “With LTC insurance and a good retirement plan, you can look forward to independence and a satisfying existence in spite of needing care,” Heinert Heinert.
5. Tax Relief. A substantial portion of LTC premiums may be deducted on federal income tax returns. Many states offer additional tax deductions or credits. “Why not smile at tax time?” says Heinert. “Get yourself set up for 2015 and every year after.”
For all these reasons, ”you’ll have less to worry about this December,” says Heinert.  Heinert, is to link up with an advisor you trust. When that happens, “Many people tell us their stress just melts away.”.

Happy new year to all our members!
A new year, and a little change to pig registrations. The BKKPS is changing the format of the herd book number that is assigned to each newly registered pig. Instead of the old 4 character numberic (eg 8765), we are now using a random selection of letters and numbers (eg 4P6WE8). The first characters are random, but the last character is always a number and represents the year in which the pig was registered ie 4P6WE8 indicates that the pig was registered in 2018.
This change will only affect pigs being registered from 1st January 2018, with older pigs keeping their existing herd book number.
After 8 years on the committee, Sam has stood down to concentrate on other commitments. In line with the constitution the committee have co-opted Simon Whiteley as interim chair until a suitable replacement can be sought. Ellen Thomas has also stood down as publicity and marketing officer but is going to remain i/c social media.I would like to thank both on behalf of the society and its members for the hard work and dedication they have shown the society.With this in mind we are looking for a publicity and marketing officer to work alongside Ellen in her role. If anyone else has a particular skill or would like to get involved with the running of the society and help us celebrate 25 years of the BKKPS then please contact our Secretary, Dan Thomas, secretary@britishkunekunepigsociety.co.uk
Hello all,
Firstly can I take this opportunity to say a genuine thank you for all that you do for the breed and the Society. Our breeders are what keep both the breed and the Society going, without you there is literally nothing!
The Registrar would also like to thank you for your patience over the last few months. The backlog is close to being cleared!
Please may I ask you to take the time to read through the information below. None of this may apply to you but I am hoping we can all support each other, and new breeders, so we get things right.
We are receiving birth notifications, registrations and transfers both online and in paper form that have mistakes. We are also receiving applications for birth notifications and registrations that don't follow the guidelines for timings, eligibility and identification. This means a lot of work for the Registrar and the Secretary and as a result things are not being processed quickly.
The main issues are:
· No individual ear tag numbers for pigs
· Ear tag numbers are the same as ones already used before (duplicates)
· Trying to register boars in a first year of breeding (without contacting us first)
· Notifying after 40 days
· Registering after 18 months/after breeding
We are now looking far more critically at ear tag numbers and will notice if you are using tag numbers you have done before; we will also not approve registrations where no individual ear tag numbers have been given. In some cases we may ask you to provide photographs of the ear tag in the pig's ear before it leaves your holding. We are receiving communication from new owners asking us for ear tags for pigs and, on inspecting the database, we find these pigs are registered as having been tagged!
We know there are sometimes exceptions to the rules and, as a committee, we are happy to discuss these on a case by case basis so please do contact us in unusual cases before you try to notify/register/the pig leaves your holding.
May I also remind you about the articles available on the BKKPS website.
It would help tremendously if you were to pass these links on to new breeders who buy breeding pigs from you so they understand the rules before breeding. Here they are for ease of reference:
Over the winter the Registrar will be writing an article for the Newsletter and BKKPS website as well as producing a help guide for new breeders to try and support new people coming into breeding. Please may I ask you to help by feeding back to us:
· What do you find confusing, especially as a new breeder?
· What things don’t you understand or cannot find help with?
· What problems do you experience with either the online system/paper system for notifying and registration?
· How could we improve/what else would support you?
· Anything else?!
Please direct your responses to:
secretary@britishkunekunesociety.org.uk or chair@britishkunekunesociety.org.uk
Many thanks to you all for taking the time to read this.

If you use paper applications for registrations please could you download a new copy from the members area of the website, this will include the new address.
IMPORTANT INFO:
Hello all, Sam Jones here :)
This week, DAWN STEVENS has decided to step down from the role of Show Co-ordinator so she can concentrate on her own pigs and the shows she attends. She will also be stepping down from the committee. It is with great sadness we see her leave, she has been both a show and BKKPS stalwart and is a very sincere, warm, kind, caring and thoughtful person. A lovely person to be around who actively encourages and supports anyone with an interest in pigs. She has personally been hugely successful in both the show ring and breeding; I know she will continue with hopefully more time to focus on herself and her own herd. She has worked extremely hard as a committee member , her greatest success being the introduction of the BKKPS Champion of Champions. , DAWN STEVENS, we wish you all the best for the future, take care, lots of love from Sam and the BKKPS team x x x x

4 pages written 31 Oct 1869 by John Davies Ormond in Napier City to Sir William Fox In a new development, Apple is reportedly working on ARM chips for its Mac devices. The company currently uses Intel processors for its MacBook models, but is supposedly looking to reduce reliance on the chipmaker, starting with supplementing Intel processors with an ARM chip for low-power tasks.
Bloomberg reports that Apple-built ARM chips will be integrated partially in MacBook Pro models scheduled to be unveiled this year. The new chips built for Mac will be used for low power tasks, and leave the Intel chip to take care of the heavy-duty processing.
The new chip could presumably handle basic things like maintaining background app activity. “The updated part, internally codenamed T310, would handle some of the computer’s low-power mode functionality. Apple engineers are planning to offload the Mac’s low-power mode, a feature marketed as Power Nap, to the next-generation ARM-based chip,” the report claims, citing people familiar with the matter.
While these new chips are expected to be integrated in the refreshed MacBook Pro models scheduled for later this year, eventually, the company is supposedly looking to completely switch to ARM-based chips and reduce reliance on Intel’s processors. Apple’s iPhone and iPad lineup are powered fully by in-house ARM chips, and the Cupertino giant is reportedly aiming to to transition its Mac lineup in the same direction. However, the company has no “near-term plans” to ditch Intel processors for its laptops and desktops, the report claims, though it started exploring this direction five years ago in a bid to improve power-efficiency.
There are several reasons why Apple would look to do away with Intel processors on its Mac lineup. The first, is greater control over hardware and software integration, while another would be greater say on the cost of Mac components.
Integrating two chips into the MacBook Pro will help in improving overall battery life optimisation, given this year’s complaints about overall usage time. The report claims that the role of the new ARM chip in the Power Nap feature would not be highlighted by the company, much in the same way the company didn’t highlight the use of the T1 ARM chip utilised in current MacBook Pro models to power the Touch Bar. This year’s MacBook Pro models will integrate Intel’s latest Kaby Lake processors, and are expected to upgrade up to 32GB RAM.
Thursday’s Bloomberg report also reiterates the publication’s previous claim that Apple is set to release a faster version of its 12-inch MacBook this year, and a new iMac with multi-functional USB Type-C functionality.
Notably, ARM Holdings, which was recently acquired by SoftBank, does not manufacture its own processors – it only providers processor and GPU designs that are used by chipmakers like Apple, Qualcomm, and Samsung, who usually further customise the designs for their own implementations, and manufactured by fabs like TSMC and Samsung. The ARM-based chips are widely used in smartphones and tablets the world over, and are heralded for their power-efficiency compared to Intel and AMD’s x86 counterparts.
Intel recently seemingly acknowledged this failing in its own processors by signing a licensing deal with ARM to produce 10nm ARM-based chips for mobile devices. The chipmaker had introduced its own line of x86 mobile and tablet chips under its Atom brand, but couldn’t shake ARM or Qualcomm’s grip on the market.
Apple’s reported move is in a similar direction to what Microsoft recently announced – the maker of the leading PC operating system in December said it would bring ARM chipset support to Windows 10 in partnership with Qualcomm, for the purpose of producing always-connected PCs with lower-power consumption and cellular connectivity. Qualcomm, apart from making ARM-based processors, is also one of the leading manufacturers of cellular modems. The first ARM-powered Windows 10 PCs are expected to launch by year-end.ALSO READofo dockless bicycle sharing platform forays into the city Israel central bank mulls issuing digital currency for faster payments Gold prices little changed as dollar holds steady on tax bill hopes Sensex falls from record highs ahead of RBI minutes RBI policy panel urges vigilance against inflation - minutes

RECOMMENDED FOR YOULast Wednesday evening, after a thoroughly ordinary meal at the trendy new ‘Beresford Hotel’, I’d had enough red wine and port for my clients to convince me to take them for a lap dance back in the CBD.
They hopped in a taxi…whereas I was so drunk I thought a ride on ‘The Stealth Vespa’ might be in order…and we arranged to meet inside ‘Madam Chang’s Imperial Whoopee Parlour’ * in twenty minutes.
I arrived at the ‘Pitt St Ballet’ ** and to say that I was off my chops would be an understatement. If the universe is very, very big…then I was very, very off my chops. Nevertheless, I proceeded to stroll through the front door, past the two bouncers of unknown but decidedly Pacific Island extraction, when one of them noticed my little rucksack and asked if he could look inside.
Rewind about three days…
One of my work colleagues had broken the tip off the office carving knife, a whacking great 33cm hunk of sharpened, Japanese stainless steel…and I had put the knife into my rucksack with a view to taking it home, grinding off the damaged tip and re-sharpening the blade. I had not got around to doing this yet…and the knife was still in my rucksack.
Fast-forward back to the story:..
So, I was standing at the door to ‘Booze and Smoos’ ***, casually smoking a cigarette while Fella Felloffalori and Mia Fartuesele rummaged through my rucksack, quickly discovering the carving knife which they pulled out for everyone to see.
‘What the fuck is this eh, bro,’ one of the amazed bouncers asked.
‘Well, it appears to be a large carving knife,’ I replied…too drunk to think of what else it COULD be besides a large carving knife.
‘And just where did you think you’d be going with it, bro,’ they continued.
‘Well, obviously I was looking to perhaps cruise into the club and cut a few of the girls from ear to flaps,’ I ventured, wondering whether these two bouncers had keen, bouncery senses of humour.
Of course they didn’t.
‘Well how about you get the fuck up against the wall while we call the cops eh, bro,’ they yelled instead of falling to the floor in hysterical laughter at my timely joke…like I had hoped.
Ten minutes later the police arrived, by which time I’d managed to explain to the bouncers what had happened…and amazingly they not only believed me but even told the cops it was a false alarm and that it had all been a huge misunderstanding.
I was then allowed to enter ‘Naked Overpriced Greedy Money-Hungry Coke Molls R Us’ **** and spend a stupid, stupid amount of hard-earned cash (which I thoroughly regretted the next morning)…after checking my carving knife at the door.
And they say capitalism is dead…
* Obviously not the club’s real name.
** This isn’t the real name either.
*** This is closer; but still not the real name
**** OK, I’m just being a little bitter and twisted about the whole experience now…The Other Guys
Primary tabs
A few years ago, we went to Vegas for our anniversary. We stayed at The Flamingo. One morning, as we were leaving for breakfast, the front of the hotel was blocked off - they were filming a movie! All I could see was a battered red Prius on the back of a flatbed truck. The security guard told us that they were filming a scene about a guys in a car that got shipped across country and that The Rock was in the movie. We milled around for a while, waiting to see if there was gonna be any action, but the nickel slots were calling to me, so we wandered off. I had totally forgotten about the incident...until I was watching The Other Guys!
Will Ferrell is funny again...why didn't anyone tell me? I was sure that he had "Eddie Murpheyed" himself after Land of the Lost and Megamind, but Ferrell's role as a pimpin' accountant cop was second only to Frank the Tank.
Was Marky Mark wearing a wig? Because he totally looked like a Sabotage-era Beastie Boy. He was HILARIOUS, but he is hit or miss with me. Except for Boogie Nights, he's pretty blah. I probably need to see The Fighter before I write him off.
Even though they were only in the film about 10 minutes, The Rock and Samuel L. Jackson were easily the best thing about the film. In fact, I've totally forgiven The Rock for Tooth Fairy. I can't think of anything Samuel L. Jackson needs forgiveness for...although I haven't seen Black Snake Moan, so I reserve the right to change my mind.
I've been wondering where Michael Keaton has been the last 10 years or so. According to IMDb, Toy Story 3, Herbie Fully Loaded and a bunch of shit I've never heard of. He was great as Captain Mauch - I'm glad he (and TLC) are back on my radar.
I vomited a little when I saw Anne Heche. Same thing happened when she showed up in Nip/Tuck. Blech.
How was this rated PG-13?
So, I'm thinking about trading my bad ass, gas guzzling Challenger in for a Prius....yeah, fuck a bunch of that.Lucky Ali was launched on the silver screen first time in 1962 and done a few Movies so far successfully. He has also worked on the Television series

tags- amazon LG V30+ quiz 9 january answers,After the months long battle for supremacy, the Nadigar Sangam elections came to a nail biting finish last night. The polling took place in Chennai yesterday and the results were announced around midnight. The Vishal, Nasser and Karthi led Pandavar Ani swept the polls by clinching all the five chief posts in the association.
The counting was as intense and dramatic as the general elections, with both Pandavar Ani and Sarathkumar groups fighting neck to neck till the end. Vishal has been elected General Secretary of the Sangam while veteran actor Nasser won the President post and Karthi claimed the Treasurer post.
Senior actor Sarathkumar conceded his defeat and congratulated the Pandavar Ani team. Meanwhile, the Pandavar Ani members expressed their determination to solve the association’s issues at the earliest.
-The Italian that came up with this combination of Marscapone cheese and coffee was a genius. Tiramisu is one of my favorite desserts, not just to eat but it's also perfect to make a family style bowl that's perfect for a large gathering but is still elegant. This is my version of Tiramisu and I love to lighten it up with the addition of whipped cream.
Ingredients
6 egg yolks
1 1/2 cups sugar
1 cup Marscapone cheese
1 cup whipping cream
Savoiardi Lady fingers – 2 – 3 packages
1 cup expresso- add sugar
Coffee liquer(optional)
1/2 cup shaved dark chocolate
Process
Whisk the egg yolks and sugar together
Place them over a double boiler till the sugar melts whisking aggressively so the eggs do not cook
Remove and set aside
Whisk the cream till stiff and set aside
Add the Marscapone to the mixing bowl and whip till smooth
Add the egg and sugar mixture
Fold in 3/4 of the whipping cream
Dip the cookies in the coffee and stack in a serving bowl
Alternate the dipped cookies and the cheese mixture
Finish with whipping cream and sprinkle generously with shaved chocolate

The first ever "Not Quite Spoleto"...Art Exhibit was held during the 2008 Moultrie High School Class Reunion at the historic Sullivan's Island home of Gene West ("Most Talented" classmate and varsity football).
As Sparky Witte, Reunion Coordinator ("Wittiest" classmate, tract team member) Linda West, Gwen West Wilson and other classmates renewed old friendships,
memories of Virginia Fouche Bolton, art teacher to many present were discussed.
In her memory, on the opening day of Spoleto Festival USA and Piccolo Spoleto, The "Not Quite Spoleto".. Art Exhibit was somewhat irreverently mounted to continue the tradition of showing fine art which she instilled.
A creative, sometimes hard driving teacher, Mrs. Bolton was an inspiration to her many students and a driving force for a lifetime of interest in the arts.
Classmates Kenny Barnes (MHS art club) and Dana Schneider (MHS band and Valedictorian, The High School of Charleston Class of '69) visit.
Kenny remembers the wildlife artwork he created and sold "back in the day". He told of the time Mrs. Bolton took him to meet Anne Worsham Richardson an accomplished Chas. painter and ornithologist, as an incentive to further his skills.
Mrs. Bolton organized an annual end of school sidewalk art show at Moultrie which provided her students with the opportunity to show and sell their student artwork.
The first Art Show I helped organize was a benefit to raise money for the Moultrie Art Club to visit the
National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC. That trip was the first chance many of us had to see great national artistic masterpieces in person.
Mrs. Bolton later taught art at other local schools and became an accomplished professional artist with a successful gallery in Charleston. Her paintings and fine art prints are still in great demand. ()
Joe (MHS band) and Sally Mansfield look over old newspaper articles at the exhibit.
Left to rt. Sissy Kirchner Seyle ("Best All Around"classmate, class treasurer, Hall of Fame), Katherine (Kay) Muschick Schneider (exhibiting artist, art club), and Dottie Benton Frank (best selling author and art club secretary).
Karin Tharin Lyons (girl's tract team), Lara Seabough Northcutt (cheerleader), and Lynn Ward (artist, cheerleader) enjoying the evening.
Paintings by Kay Muschick Schneider were on display among memorabilia of past Moultrie HS Art Shows.
Memories of creating art in the past lead to plans for former classmates to get together to paint in the future.
Mrs. Bolton would be pleased.
A "Not Quite Spoleto"... Art Exhibit. Honoring the past. Facing the future.

Lots going on. Enjoy!
I was having such a big time yacking with my friends, I didn't get to see the show. How 'bout a post with some of the artwork?
I guess Mrs. Bolton would give me my usual grade for this - incomplete...
You and me both Geechee Boy. Remember the weekly homework? 10 pages of drawings in our sketch books ea week? And she'd initial every pg to make sure - yeah lots of incompletes on those. I remember drawing lots of bottles, too.
Hi y'all,
I remember the sketchbook drawing too.
It was hard figuring out what to draw to fill those 10 pages up ea week. Usually I drew whatever I could find in school: cafeteria food, pencils, books, whatever.
The first thing Mrs. B had our class draw were bottles. First a line down the middle. The rest was easy-just draw ea side the same. She had so many different kinds of bottles in the art room for us to draw, she got the nickname "Bottles Bolton".
But I did learn how to draw from life- not an easy thing to do, even now.
Geechee Boy- I'll see about getting some of the paintings from the "show" on the blog. Thanks for asking.
Kay
Thanks Kay. Great Pics. Your are so industrious. I'm still trying to get my web pages to work correctly.
I do remember those sketch pages each week. I loved art class. It never lasted long enough.
May 24th will be here in a blink of an eye..See ya soon,
Lynn
I agree, art class was my fav. part of day. And Mrs. Bolton was right - it's important to keep sketching from life.
Good luck with your web pages. Let's get together and paint soon. The weather is great and I know just the spot...Have a Facebook account staff but it bothers you that you labeled? One reason we do not like to label us is that we are afraid we have gone wrong with the picture or if the case of an embarrassing photo. Friends often labeled photo together, but sometimes you just do it just to annoy.
That you are tagged in a photo on Facebook can be favorable as it can also be your doom, because you never know what photo it can be and if it can affect in a way. To avoid these bad times we will teach you to solve this problem with this article entitled “I do not tagged in facebook”
I do not want to label me on Facebook:
To get out of this trouble first thing you need to do is log into your Facebook account, then you click on the icon in form of arrow which is located at the top right of the page next to the icon in the form of the padlock. Several options will be displayed where you select Settings he says.
Now you must select the option that is on the left that says Biography and labeling, here you have the option to place yourself on you indicating the reference image. Clicking on edit and press the reference button and select On. Done this way every time you labeled Facebook will send a notice to up to you if you want to be published to your Facebook wall.
You are afraid that friends tag you in photos uncomfortable or out of tune.

There is nothing that any human being will say about it that we will listen to, particularly if such views run contrary to the arrangement of God concerning the issue. There is no logic that can erase what is in the Bible. We are under obligation to bring 10 per cent of the profit that we make from our business transactions or from the salary we earn. This is contained in the Bible book of Malachi 3:10. The Bible also warns that whoever fails to act accordingly is under a terrible curse. God even challenged us to put him to test and see if he would not open wide the windows of heaven to bring us blessings.
Salary earners should first deduct the tithe before spending anything from their income. It is the only command with a promise for those who obey and a curse for those who disobey. Tithes must be paid directly to the church where one worships. It is wrong of anybody to share his or her tithe to the needy directly. The Bible says it must be brought to the storehouse which is the church.
You don’t need to know what happens to the tithe you pay. Leave it to the servants of God who will use it for evangelism. It is not for you to investigate how the money is utilised. Many people bring problems upon themselves when they feel that they know more than God. However, it is compulsory for the servants of God to give account of the tithe and other offerings paid by church members to avoid corruption. Proper accountability of incomes accruable to the church will enable the authorities to pay the salaries of pastors and other workers as and when due.— Prophet Samuel Abiara, outgoing General Evangelist of the Christ Apostolic Church (worldwide)
Pastors should give account of how they spend tithes — Adenuga.— Pastor Paul Adenuga, founder, Faith Revival Apostolic Church, Lagos
Tithe doesn’t have to be cash — Gbonigi
There is nothing wrong with Christians paying tithes to the church because it is biblical. It must be paid cheerfully to God. Tithe is the minimum fraction of a Christian’s total income that must be given to God in support of His work. It is the minimum percentage of a person’s income that God commands him or her to give.
Genesis 14:20, 28:22, Leviticus 27: 30-34, Deuteronomy 14: 22-29, 2Chronicle 31: 5-10, Malachi 3: 8-12 and Luke 11: 42 are some of the Bible verses that support payment of tithes to the church.
God tells us in Leviticus 27: 30-34 that one-tenth of all the produce of the land, whether grain or fruit, belong to Him. One out of every 10 domestic animals belongs to the Lord. These are the commands that the Lord gave to Moses on Mount Sinai for the people of Israel.
The appropriate time to pay tithe is weekly, monthly or quarterly. Those times would enable the church to have adequate financial resources to carry on its missionary activities. Tithes might not be cash. Christians could also offer professional services or expert advice to the church and this could come in form of tithing. Many Christians have been giving to God in form of professional services and expert advice to the church than they would have given in cash.— Bolanle Gbonigi, retired Anglican Bishop of Akure Diocese
If you rob God, you will pay for it — Makinde
The evidence is numerous in the Old Testament. In the New Testament although Jesus did not say, ‘Pay tithes,’ when he met somebody, he said, ‘Go and give the priests what they require.’ I have spent 45 unbroken years in the ministry and I rose to the pinnacle of my career as the Prelate and head of Methodist Church Nigeria. If people say they will not pay it, they are punishing themselves. I learnt how to tithe through my wife and I have never regretted it and I won’t regret it now. You cannot rob God.
This academic exercise – I call it theological and academic exercise – is a futile exercise. It is a waste (of time). I cannot cheat God. What God has done for me is more than that (tithe). I give the tenth of everything I have monetarily to the church and I have never regretted it because givers never lack.
If you ask to know the biblical reference, is it because of what you want to give to God? Has God not given more to us? Our welfare, the food, the planet, the water we drink, the air we breathe: are they small? Now, we want to give one-tenth to God and they are grumbling and saying they want to know the biblical basis. I am the biblical base for it and I am giving my testimony now; that the more I give to God, the more God gives to me. I am not going into that debate. Until I die and see my God, I will not go into that debate.
The Bible says, ‘Give your tithe to God.’ For me, that is if you have it. If you don’t have it, give your heart to God. Remember the (biblical) widow; she put down all she had, not even one-tenth. And Jesus said that woman gave more than even big-pocketed people who came to give a part of their money. I cannot debate what I want to do for God and nobody can water it down in my heart. I am in my 76th year.
Christianity is a growing religion; it is a dynamic religion and we must be dynamic with it. In those (biblical) days, they gave agricultural materials; now we have monetised it. As far as I am concerned, I will never go back on it because the more I give to God, the more he gives to me. Can I pay for the air I breathe? Can I pay for the water I drink? Can I pay for favour? Can I pay for good health? I can’t. Therefore, I cannot cheat God. If you rob God, you will pay for it one way or the other.— Retired Archbishop Sunday Ola Makinde, former Prelate of the Methodist Church Nigeria
Tithing not a must in Catholic Church — Osu
The first mention of a tithe in the Bible occurs in Genesis when Melchizedek, a king and a “priest of God Most High,” offered a sacrifice of bread and wine in thanksgiving for Abraham’s victory over several enemy kings. As an offering to God, Abraham gave Melchizedek “a tenth of everything.”  Bibe (CIC 222).— Rev.Fr Osu, Director of Social Communications, Catholic Archdiocese of Lagos
Tithes should not be used for business — Kaigama
Tithing is accepted in the church and it didn’t start today. From the first pages of the Bible, we know that tithing was practised. The scripture is very clear about that and a percentage of what you earn is supposed to be given to those who are poor and in need or to promote certain activities that are favourable to the poor. So, that is not in question; but the question is whether the people concerned use the tithes for the purpose intended.
The tithe, including church collections in the bazaars they do, are meant to promote the work of God, promote evangelism, and take care of needy people in the society. But it doesn’t exclude taking care of the priests or the pastors whose duty it is to preach the word of God because they have no salaries, and no income elsewhere.
A good pastor should not be running a business. In the Catholic Church, for instance, the priests are prevented from engaging in any business or spending time looking for money in order to support themselves. So, they have a right to take a part of what is donated to support themselves and work for the church in many ways. If, for instance, the Catholic Church has a school, and the school is attended by children, the proceeds from tithes or bazaars or harvest thanksgiving or collections are used to help in improving the children and giving them a good education. That is a commendable cause.
Now, this is where we get it wrong: Everything we say, we refer to chapters or verses of the Bible. It’s an abuse of the Bible. That is not how the Bible should be used. The Bible is not a code of conduct or constitution. It is a shallow and fanatical way of interpreting things. There are some practices that preceded the writing of the Bible. There were already functional Christian communities that existed for years before the Bible was written. That is why in the Catholic Church we insist on not only the Bible as the word of God, we also talk about traditions. What was being practised before the word of God was communicated to us?
I want to assure you that tithing is scriptural. But you don’t use tithes to run your personal businesses or improve your family’s welfare by sending your children to the best schools. For God’s sake, it is meant to serve the church and the poor. Tithes are not for personal prosperity. There should be an account for not only tithes but money collected in the name of the church. There should be no monopoly of money collected, neither should the accounts be hidden.— Archbishop Ignatius Kaigama, President of Catholic Bishops Conference of Nigerian and Catholic Archbishop of Jos
Source: PUNCH:>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>It should come as no surprise that Amanda Parker is using a lot of what she learned as a volleyball player not that many years ago at Barnstable High to build Sandwich's fledgling program.
EAST SANDWICH – It should come as no surprise that Amanda Parker is using a lot of what she learned as a volleyball player not that many years ago at Barnstable High to build Sandwich's fledgling program.
“When I saw some of the drills she was doing in a joint practice we had, I had to smile,” said Tom Turco, legendary coach of the 15-time state champion Barnstable Red Raiders. “I said, 'Amanda, that looks familiar.' ”
The 22-year-old Parker, who started the program last year as a junior varsity team before taking it to varsity this fall, played four years for Turco from 2004 through the 2007 season. She was named to the All-State Team her senior season.
Parker's young Blue Knights team at Sandwich is 4-3 this season, the three setbacks one more than what Parker experienced in her entire high school career. Barnstable was 97-2 in her four years as a Red Raider. Both losses came in her senior season.
“(But) she never lost the last game of the season,” said Turco.
Yes, Parker was a member of four state championship teams at Barnstable.
“She was second setter to Genevieve Moore her first two years, and Genevieve was one of the best setters we've had,” Turco said. “Amanda was a great athlete, pretty controlled on the floor. If one set wasn't great, she forgot about it and went onto the next one.”
Parker finished her high school career with more than 1,000 assists, an impressive milestone.
Now she using her enthusiasm and knowledge of the game to teach a new generation of players at Sandwich. So far, so good for all concerned.
Parker is assisted by Stephanie Swider, who played college volleyball at Thomas College in Waterville, Maine. The coaches were greeted by more than 80 players last season. This year was more than the same.
Understandably, there was not a lot of experience last year, but this season the Knights have varsity, junior varsity and freshmen teams and have been competitive in varsity play. There are 14 players on the varsity.
Senior captain Kerry Kelley, who had played high school volleyball in Florida, was encouraged by her mother to try out for the new Sandwich team.
“I had my doubts about it. It was a first-year program. When I saw 80 girls in the gym I was really surprised,” said Kelley.
“I was really surprised at the amount of work (coach Parker) had us do at tryouts. I thought, first-year program, it would be like they are everywhere. But she had everything set up and it was very rigorous. She knew exactly what she wanted to do. She wanted us in shape. You need endurance to get through a whole game.”
All part of Parker's plan and all a product of what she learned from Turco.
“I brought the physical demands over (from Barnstable),” Parker said. “This year, tryouts were all running. They did not touch a volleyball the first day. They all survived and stuck with it. It showed their commitment level.”
Parker started playing volleyball when she was about 8, coming up through Barnstable's recreation program. She continued on into Junior Olympics. She would love to get a recreation program started in Sandwich, but for now her varsity players work at clinics in the elementary and middle schools.
Parker, who graduated from Cape Cod Community College and manages Koko FitClub in Mashpee, said it's important to spread the word and build at the grass root level.
“I had coached a lot of younger camps and when we started here, instead of bringing in a lot of high school tactics, I had to implement fundamentals. But they picked it up so fast, it was very impressive. We were able to develop our skills in a rapid time.”
Kelley was impressed from the outset with her coach's organization, which can again be traced back to Barnstable. Turco's advice to Parker: Make sure everything is planned.
“It's no different than teaching,” Turco said. “If you go in with a well-thought lesson plan, you'll have a good class.
“What I remember telling Amanda was to make sure practices are thought out prior. Post practice schedules before the fact, by the minute, so kids can come in and see what's going on; so they can see where the hard part of practice is and where the fun part is.
“I told her, you're going to live in a world of expected behavior,” added Turco. “If you expect a player to be on time, you have to work that into the program. If they are not on time, there has to be a consequence. It's basic.
“It's totally about the players,” said Turco. “Having a positive attitude on the court, making sure they get along together on the court, making sure they can handle feedback in a positive way. If you think positive, positive things are going to happen.”
There are other tenets of the Barnstable Red Raider philosophy Parker has borrowed. She was educated by one of the most successful coaches in state history, as well as his assistant, Marylou Martin, and is smart enough to use that knowledge. But she doesn't flaunts it.
“She doesn't usually bring up Barnstable,” Kelley said. “I think she gets respect from the players because she came from there, but she also gets some respect because she is younger and we can identify with her more.”
Sandwich senior captain Abigail Mondou was a field hockey player before switching to volleyball last year. Her feelings seem to be shared by many in the program.
“It's my favorite sport now,” Mondou said. “There's a lot of conditioning that goes with it and I wasn't ready for that, but now I am. I would love for people to just try it and see how hard it actually is.”
Mondou said at first she wasn't aware Parker had come from Barnstable. “When I found out I was, 'Wow, you must have been really good.' ”
Mondou said Parker has a positive approach.
“If we do something wrong, she doesn't get mad at us because she knows we are in our first years of doing it. But she gives constructive criticism, too. She's really positive.”
Sandwich has beaten Plymouth North, Nauset and Sturgis, and lost a tough, five-game match to Falmouth before being swept 3-0 by Dennis-Yarmouth.
“We played so well against Falmouth and it was really good for the girls to see a full, five-game match. Very competitive. It put their mentality to the test,” said Parker.
“Technically, we lost, but I usually measure it on how they perform and I think they won that game. Everything we did in practice we did on the court. It showed what Sandwich volleyball is capable of doing.”
Watch out. volleyball world, Sandwich is coming.
“I think she's doing a terrific job,” Turco said. “I look forward to seeing that program grow.”Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces are prominent silkworm producers in China. In early May each year, every household begins preparing to breed silkworms when barley becomes yellow and the mulberry fields turn green.
Adust-sized silkworm ovum will grow into an ant-shaped silkworm after brooding for a month, and then grow into a long white worm after four periods of quiescence and exuviation and then, the silkworm begins spinning pure white silk and finally turns into a pupa. There are many legends about the development of silkworms. One of them is a touching story, which goes as follows.
Once upon a time, there was a father and his daughter who depended on each other very much. They had a white horse, which the girl fed with mulberry leaves. Once, the father went out to do some trade and didn't come back on time. No one knew of his whereabouts. The daughter was very worried about him. One day, she prayed to marry a kind-hearted man who could help her find her father. When she had just finished asking for this, the white horse standing beside her nodded, circled around her three times and galloped away. Several days later, the white horse found the old man who had lost his way in the mountains and carried him home on his back. However, the white horse was always with the girl from then on and the father was puzzled by the matter. After he questioned her, the girl told the truth to her father. He got very angry, "It is natural that the horse looks for its owner, but how can an animal be a match for a person?" When the horse heard this, it began neighing and refused to eat anything. The father was very angry, and killed it with an arrow. He skinned the horse and dried the hide in the sunshine. After the daughter collected mulberry leaves, she returned home. Caressing the skin of the horse, she burst into tears. When her tears dropped on the horse, her body was wrapped up by the skin and flown to the sky. Later, seeing snow-white silkworms hanging on the mulberry trees, people said that theses silkworms were the girls wrapped in the horse's skin. Since the head of the silkworm is similar to that of a horse's head, Matouniang (a girl with a horse's head) became another name for silkworm. When the daughter missed her father, she spun out the long silk. This is a legend about the origin of how silkworms spin silk and become silkworm cocoons.
In the past, whenever there was a bumper
harvest of silkworm cocoons sericulturists would light an incense burner and offerings were arranged in the central room of a house to thank the Goddess of Silkworms. The statue of the goddess engraved on a wooden plate was a goddess in a horse-skin cloth. She had a vertical eye on her forehead which was deliberately drawn because no one could bear to see the arrow wound.
It is very interesting that Japan also has a legend about Matouniang with the spread of Chinese silkworms to Japan in the third century. However, in Japan the Goddess of Silkworms is a Japanese beauty in a kimono that rides a horse.
Sericulture in the region of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces is as important as farming. A good or poor harvest of silkworms is directly related to the livelihood of sericulturists. Silkworms are tender and delicate, hard to raise and easily get diseases. If the diseases spread, all the efforts of the sericulturists will be wasted. Therefore, when the season for breeding silkworms comes, every household in the villages is very busy. There are also many taboos and regulations in this period.
There are taboos surrounding the raising of silkworms. Women are prohibited from visiting friends, children from shouting, and men from going without a shirt during the time when silkworms are being hatched. On seeing peach branches which are thought to avoid evil and red paper with the characters can yue zhi li (A man should be polite in the month of silkworms) inserted on the eaves of a sericulturist's house, an unexpected guest should go away quietly.
There are other taboos and regulations concerning the homes of sericulturists, such as forbidding a stranger to enter the house, prohibitions on shouting, crying, and knocking doors or windows in the house. Liquor, vinegar, and anything smelling of fish of mutton should not be brought into a sericulturist's house and it is forbidden to dig the ground, cut grass, husk rice with a mortar and pestle or to burn fur and hair around a sericulturist's house. In the past, before putting silkworm eggs into a round shallow basket woven out of bamboo, people always pasted a wood engraving of a cat on the basket. This was because mice are natural enemies of silkworms. The mice often climbed to the shelves of silkworms and ate young silkworms when night-watchers dozed off. Hence, every household not only raised cats, but also retains the custom of pasting a picture of a cat on the basket.
Of course, some regulations are superstitious, for instance, menstruating women or women about to give birth are forbidden to raise silkworms; when buying mulberry leaves from other villages, in order to dispel evil spirits, sericulturists use mulberry branches to lash the leaves three times, and then feed them to silkworms. However, the purpose of all these prohibitions is to avoid noise pollution and bad smells. Young silkworms grow healthily in a clean and quiet environment.
When harvesting silkworm cocoons, sericulturists will, according to tradition, buy fish and meat, kill chickens and arrange feasts to celebrate. At this time, friends and relatives bring loquats, duck eggs and zongzi (a triangular dumpling made of glutinous rice wrapped in bamboo or other leaves) to visit these sericulturists. They come to send best wishes and ask how many can hua (harvests) these sericulturists get.
Can hua (literally "silkworm flower") is not a flower, but a word which indicates a good or bad harvest of silkworm cocoons. According to local custom, when young silkworms lie dormant for the fourth time, sericulturists will weigh these silkworms on a scale. For instance, if one catty of silkworms can spin out six catties of silkworm cocoons, the six-catty cocoons are called liu fen can hua (liu means six, and fen is a unit of measurement). The word can hua is often used in reference to the silkworm trade, but its meaning has various connotations according to the situation.
For example, local people call women sericulturists can hua gu niang (gu niang means a girl). On the morning of the first day of the lunar year, a woman sericulturist must, according to tradition, sweep the floor from the outside to the inside of a house. It is called sao can hua di (sweep the floor of can hua), meaning that there will be a good harvest of silkworm cocoons when can hua is swept into a house.
On New Year holidays, people will greet each other by saying, gong xi fa cai (may you make a fortune) and can hua er she si fen) (wish you a good harvest of silkworm cocoons).
On the day of the Qingming Festival, at the beginning of April, can hua gu niang will insert can hua in their hair at the temples. Can hua here refers to small flower, or golden yellow vegetable flowers. The can hua gu niang will go to a monastery to pray together at an appointed time. They will also buy some silk flowers from the monastery and insert them in round shallow baskets. This is called tao can hua (tao here mean to beg). They believe that can hua coming from a monastery can expel all the evils in a sericulturist's house, so they will have a brisk silkworm business. At night, the woman of the house will prepare a delicious dinner. The family then gets together to drink. This is called can hua jiu (jiu means liquor). Drinking can hua jiu means that they will do their best to raise silkworms.
When a couple get married, the girl's parents will send the couple two young mulberries, two round shallow baskets of silkworms and silk clothes and bedding as a dowry. They hope that the bride will bring brisk business.

The trim and the housing are the main components to recessed lighting housing. Before buying the trim based on your favorite, it is necessary to know the right housing for you. Therefore, pay more attention to this tips and tricks
Make Sure You Pick the Best One of Recessed Lighting Housing
The first thing you should know before buying recessed lighting housing is to know whether you style housing is a Remodel or New Construction. If you live in your own house or apartments, it is beneficial to choose the Remodel one because it is less bulky and appropriate for your house or apartment due to its limited access to the space above the new fixture, but still you have to make holes in your ceiling to hold your new recessed lighting. Meanwhile, new construction is appropriate when you built a new building where you have a full access to the ceiling without sheetrock.
Make sure that you need IC or Non-IC for your recessed lighting housing. IC, which stands for insulation contact means that the fixture can come in direct contract with thermal insulation, it is necessary for you not to mind the distance from one to insulation. Meanwhile, Non-IC, which stands for non-insulation contact, means that the fixture can’t come in direct contact with thermal insulation, so you have to keep at least two to three inches from one to insulation.
Then it comes to the trim, where you can pick them freely based on your favorite! As we can see, the most visible part of the light is the trim, and it is the one that will show the other your preference and style. The first thing you should know before buying your favorite trim for your recessed lighting housing is to have an attention to the sizes, they come in multiple sizes raging, from 3” to 6” in diameter. Again and again, it is based on your favorite, do you like the bigger one or the small one, and it’s completely up to you! If your house wants to be seen as modern, we recommend you the smaller one. Yet, if you want to have a big wattage, we recommend you to choose the bigger one.
The 6” trims are usually used for the general residential main light and wall wash illumination, because they can hold the big wattages and lamps, the 5” trims are usually used for general lighting or task lighting. The 4” trims are also used for task lighting, but as it provides the low voltage, it is better to be put in the counter. As you already decided the size of the trim for your recessed light house, now you can pick the trim style based on your favorite! There are several trim styles that you can pick, such as baffle trim, reflector trim, adjustable trim, lensed trim, wall washed trim, and decorative trim. Each of them provides goods benefits, if you find them really similar; you can just pick one of style recessed lighting housing based on your preferences. So, happy shopping!

On the long drive to the training dive site we had heavily involved discussions about Northern vs. Southern Indian food and more importantly, how to make it. South Asian cuisine has long been one of my favorites and I was about to get schooled in the regional differences between North and South India, how could I resist? A melting pot of diversity herself, Manognya hails from Southern India, calls Singapore home and lived between Las Vegas and Iowa and when Varun popped the big question on her, she relocated once again to sunny Las Vegas.
A happier couple you won’t find, and while we spent several days with Manognya being very animated about life underwater, none of her expressions or mannerisms compare to how she lights up when Varun is around. A man who just becomes buoyant when Mano is near, Varun is one of the coolest people you’ll ever meet. Any guy who likes his Lassi salted and his food hotter than the sun has my vote.

Wright is a reservist with a double perspective on the current Middle East crisis. While he hasn't been called up to serve -- he's already gotten his warning letter -- he is no stranger to the boiling waters of the Persian Gulf.
As a dentist aboard the USS Trenton, which was deployed there for six months in 1988, Lieutenant Wright was one of two dentists afloat for all American forces then in the Gulf. The Trenton acted as a floating dock for both the 400-man marine air-ground task force and as a mother ship for minesweepers patrolling the troubled Middle Eastern waters.
Wright practiced dentistry in an environment regularly disrupted by a "general quarters" alarm, which signals a condition of combat readiness on war ships and requires crew members to remain at battle stations with guns and ammunition ready for loading.“Happiness, I’ve learned, comes from within.

There seems to be little that Steve Kogler wonâ€™t try. Heâ€™s worked on lobster boats in Ireland, owned a garment manufacturing business in Baltimore and worked at the Cape Gazette. Heâ€™s currently launching a career in finance.
His roots, however, are in the hospitality industry, and itâ€™s his love of food and wine that has gained him recognition in coastal Sussex. Since 2002, Kogler and wife Jennifer have owned Teller Wines in Lewes. But lately, heâ€™s been getting a rise out of customers with Old World Breads, which he started in 2007.
His cinnamon buns were the talk of the Historic Lewes Farmersâ€™ Market this year, and people line up for his sourdough at the Bethany Farmersâ€™ Market. â€œHis cinnamon bread is amazing,â€ says Patricia Talorico of Lewes. â€œI froze it and it warmed up beautifully.â€
For Kogler, the bakery is a labor of love. He jokes that he made more in high school, working more than 30 hours in a restaurant, than he does now.
Kogler, who grew up in Baltimore, was 14 when he lied about his age to get a busboy job in a harbor restaurant. By the time he was in high school, he worked after school and did double shifts on weekends. â€œIt was fun,â€ he says, â€œand I made a lot of money.â€
After living in Ireland for a year, the avid windsurfer headed to the beach, where his two brothers were part of the staff opening the Blue Moon in Rehoboth Beach. It was here that he met wife-to-be Jennifer, who was a waitress. Kogler estimates that over the years, heâ€™s worked at about 20 restaurants, including The Back Porch.
He took a detour from the hospitality business to start a garment manufacturing company, but working 80 hours a week became a grind. Although Jennifer had a good job working in city museums, Kogler sold his business and the couple moved to the beach full time. Kogler went from pasting up the Cape Gazetteâ€”this was pre-PCs, when copy was printed out and literally pasted on pagesâ€”to managing a Bose store, which led to a position as a trainer for the company.
Then came 9/11 and an economic dip. His job disappeared in the restructuring that rattled corporate America. The Koglers sold their beach house and opened Teller Wines. The name comes from their desire to â€œtellâ€ people about wine and create wine advocates.
Meanwhile, Kogler decided to try baking. Why not? His mother and grandmother were both big bakers and cooks. Totally self-taught, heâ€™s relied on tips learned from chefs throughout the years and books by baking gurus Raymond Calvel and Jeffrey Hamelman. He also got advice from Teller Wine customer Jason Stickler, owner of DiBonaventureâ€™s Provincial Bakery, who allowed Kogler to experiment in the bakeryâ€™s ovens.
Kogler has learned more than a few tricks. First, find recipes that rely on weight measurements rather than cups and teaspoons. â€œTwelve people could measure a cup and it would be different every time,â€ he notes. Next, use non-bleached King Arthur Flour, his favorite.
Then, keep track of the humidity. A span of dry weather means heâ€™ll add more water. He adapts again if itâ€™s been raining.
Donâ€™t think the environment makes a difference? Think again. Kogler was frustrated when his San Francisco-style sourdough was hardly like the bread found in San Francisco. Credit the wild microorganisms in the air there. San Fran bakers use flour and water as bait to capture yeasts and bacteria, including Lactobacillus sanfrancisco, to create a starter.
Here in Delaware, where the bacteria is different, Kogler has adapted by using a New England starter and adds 24 hours to the usual fermentation period. The sourdough is now his top seller. â€œItâ€™s crunchy on the outside with a beautiful texture,â€ he says. Whole grain bread and baguettes are also favorites.
In the resort season, he makes about 700 loaves of bread for the Lewes market and 1,000 to 1,500 for Bethany. That is in addition to wholesale products. A specially built commercial bakery on his Ellendale farm hums with activity 18 hours a day. â€œWeâ€™re never off in summer,â€ he says. He cuts back to about 10 hours off-season.
Kogler, who has been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, is planning for a time when he may not be able to bake by developing financial skills. Fans of his bread, however, hope that time is far in the future.

Antioch, TNI tend to be a little obsessive occasionally. This tends to manifest itself in two ways. 1) my face, and B) the level of cleanliness of my house. Awesomely, one of these I can blame on my mom!
Ever since I can remember, I've had an obsession with having zit-free skin. Unfortunately, I have pores the size of the Grand Canyon, so there's been plenty to "pore" over. Bwahaha! I think my mom instilled this habit since a common saying around our house was "Kelly, you need to go work on your face," after which, I'd sit on the vanity in the bathroom or in the hallway in front of the long mirror and pick and poke and prod and practically count every single crevice in my face where dirt and gunk could accumulate. If I was standing in front of the mirror in the bathroom, I'd have red marks on my legs from leaning against the counter for so long. Instead of Mom encouraging this time wasting obsession, what she should have told me was:
and just wash your damn face with product that you didn't buy at the grocery store. So I feel like I have to scour my face for potential blemishes and I've spent an equal amount of time searching for the perfect face product so that the going over my face with a magnifying glass is no longer necessary (but I'm sure I'd still do it. Le sigh.). Sephora is my own personal hell, because by the time I get to my shopping cart to purchase all the goodies I've

He's cute, no? I wonder how much he'd be worth in beauty products...
I love having a clean house. There's nothing more satisfying (especially when you have a husband and kids) than having a freshly cleaned room stay clean for more than five minutes. That being said, I haaaaaaaaaaate to clean. Except when I'm really pissed off. Then I'll scrub the shit out of whatever will sit still. So when I clean and turn around 2.482948 seconds later to find a mess, I tend to go Ghengis Khan all over everyone, no matter who made the mess. (Yes, I realize that expecting a toddler not to make a mess is stupid. I also realize that expecting a 10 year old to do anything without being told 87 times is equally stupid. And yes, I realize the insanity that I must suffer if I think that the Hubs won't throw a saucy piece of pizza crust on the beige carpet for the dog.) After I am through throwing my internal hissy fit and resigning myself to the fact that I'm cleaning AGAIN, the fuck-its set in.
I feel like this guy. A lot.
And this is the story of my life:
Honestly, if the honey badger don't give a shit, I shouldn't either.
So yeah, as much as I love coming downstairs to a clean living room, play room, and kitchen (because those are the only rooms that have no doors to shut, effectively hiding the mess), most of the time it looks as though someone tossed a grenade into Toys 'R' Us. I know I'll miss the mess someday. At least that's what I tell myself when the guilt starts to kick in.
For some reason I too bwahaha'd at your pore pun.

Saturday April 26 was DCR’s Park Serve Day.
Despite the rain over 20 volunteers mustered to help take off the winter cover. With the assistance of several DCR staff and an early start, the job was done before noon. Some of the crew started at 8 am to try to get ahead of the forecasted rain and despite of reports of downpours in other areas the heaviest rain held off until the job was done. Ernestina ex Effie M. Morrissey is Massachusetts’ Official Vessel and the volunteers were proof of that with some traveling from Boston and the western part of the Commonwealth to help out.
Step 1, Remove the plastic, here Ernestina's new DCR Supervisor, Paul Alexio, uses an improvised cutter.
The Galvin family working for the third year in memory of their father Vasco Galvao who was a crew member on Ernestina in the early 1950′s and settled in the US in 1956.
The aft beam of the cover has to be removed with a crane. Some ribs were left until that work can be done.
Thanks to all the DCR staff and the volunteers who made short work of this project. Now Ernestina is beginning to look like summer is coming!

There is now less than a week until the 2013 John Smith’s Grand National meeting gets underway and the countdown intensifies today with the unveiling of the entries and acceptors for day one of the three-day spectacular, Grand Opening Day, Thursday, April 4.
Grand Opening Day offers high-class fare, with no less than four Grade One contests plus the John Smith’s Fox Hunters’ Chase over the famous Grand National fences.
The £150,000 Betfred Bowl (2.30pm, three miles and one furlong) has 11 possible starters including the Paul Nicholls-trained duo of What A Friend, part-owned by Sir Alex Ferguson and winner of this race in 2010, plus Silviniaco Conti, who was successful in the Grade One Betfair Chase at Haydock Park in November and was still travelling well within himself when falling three fences from home in the Betfred Cheltenham Gold Cup on March 15. There are three possible representatives from Ireland – Grade One Ryanair Chase runner-up First Lieutenant (Mouse Morris), Quito De La Roque (Colm Murphy) and Whodoyouthink, who is from the stable of Oliver McKiernan – successful 12 months ago with Follow The Plan.
The four and fifth from this year’s Betfred Cheltenham Gold Cup, The Giant Bolster and Cape Tribulation, could also line up. CapeTribulation won over hurdles at both the Cheltenham Festival and the John Smith’s Grand National meeting in 2012 and his trainer Malcolm Jefferson reports the nine-year-old on track for the Betfred Bowl.
Jeffferson said today: “We entered CapeTribulation this morning and the plan is to go to the Betfred Bowl.
“I thought he had a hardish race at Cheltenham but he has come back out of it and has really perked up again. He looks tremendously well now.
“I think he goes on all ground although the only thing I would say is that the two races he won last year at Cheltenham and Aintree were on good ground.
“I am not quite sure what happened in the Gold Cup last time. They didn’t go very quick early on and coming down the hill I thought we were going to be beaten a long way and by the time they crossed the line he wasn’t beaten that far. He stayed on up the hill.”
Grand Opening Day gets underway at 2.00pm with the £100,000 Matalan Anniversary 4-Y-O Juvenile Hurdle (2.00pm, two miles and 110 yards) for which 16 entries have been received. These include the Gordon Elliott-trained Flaxen Flare, who was successful in the Fred Winter Juvenile Handicap Hurdle at the Cheltenham Festival and the Paul Nicholls-trained Irish Saint, winner of the Grade Two Adonis Juvenile Hurdle at KemptonPark in February.
Further Grade One action comes courtesy of the £75,000 Betfred Manifesto Novices’ Chase (4.50pm, two and a half miles) which has attracted 23 hopefuls. Among these are Benefficient, trained in Ireland by Tony Martin and triumphant in the Grade Two Jewson Novices’ Chase at the Cheltenham Festival as well as the second and third from that race – Dynaste (David Pipe) and Changing Times (Nigel Twiston-Davies). Nicky Henderson has four possible starters, include Rajdhani Express, another winner from the Cheltenham Festival having landed the Rewards4Racing Novices’ Handicap Chase.
The fourth Grade One contest on Grand Opening Day, the £200,000 Grade One John Smith’s Aintree Hurdle (3.05pm, two and a half miles) has been re-opened until 11.00am tomorrow.
In the John Smith’s Fox Hunters Chase (3.40pm, extended two miles and five furlongs) over the Grand National there are 27 possible confirmations including last year’s victor Cloudy Lane from the stable of Donald McCain as well as the 2010 scorer Silver Adonis (Marilyn Scudamore).
Highly-competitive handicap action comes courtesy of the £80,000 matalan.co.uk Red Rum Handicap Chase (4.15pm, two miles) which has 33 entries and the concluding Silver Cross Handicap Hurdle (5.25pm, extended three miles) where there 62 entries.

Company History:. As such, JM underwent significant restructuring in the 1990s and was acquired by Berkshire Hathaway Inc. in 2001.
Origins
In 1858, at the age of 21, Henry Ward Johns founded the H.W. Johns Manufacturing Company in New York City. The company specialized in the manufacture of asbestos textiles, roofing, and insulation materials. Over the next 40 years, until his death in 1898 of dust phthisis pneumonitis, believed to be asbestosis, Johns discovered a number of the applications of asbestos, which became known as the mineral of a thousand uses. In 1886, Charles B. Manville founded the Manville Covering Company in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and managed the company until 1900. In 1901, H.W. Johns and Manville merged to create H.W. Johns-Manville (JM), a corporation engaged primarily in the mining, manufacturing, and supply of asbestos fibers and products to industry and the government.
The management of JM was relatively stable over the years. The Manville family remained active in the management of the company through most of the twentieth century. From 1921 to 1923, Thomas F. Manville headed the company as president, treasurer, and a member of the board. In 1924, he became chairman; H.E. Manville was elected president and T.F. Manville, Jr. joined the board of directors. By 1928, H.E. Manville and Thomas Manville, Jr. sat on the board, while T.F. Merseles served as the company's president. In 1930, H.E. Manville was named chairman of the executive committee and L.H. Brown became president. This hierarchy continued until 1939.
In 1927, JM became a publicly held corporation. During the 1920s and 1930s, JM acquired several mining and manufacturing operations in the United States and Canada. Purchases included the Celite Company of California, miners and processors of diatomaceous earth--diatomite is a filtering agent--in 1928 and, in 1930, the Stevens Sound Proofing Company of Chicago, owners of patents for sound insulation.
Asbestos Problems Begin in the Late 1920s
As early as 1929, JM was defending itself against lawsuits for asbestos-related deaths. Asbestosis is a nonmalignant scarring of the lungs caused solely by exposure to asbestos. The incidence of the disease seems to be related to the duration and intensity of exposure. It may take decades for evidence of the disease to appear. Mesothelioma is a form of cancer associated with asbestos that affects the linings of the chest or abdominal cavities and that usually kills its victims within a year of its appearance. The legal issues in asbestos cases centered on the following two questions. When did the health hazards of working with asbestos become foreseeable? When warnings were issued, did they adequately communicate the danger?
From the beginning, JM claimed that employees were contributorily negligent because they knew or should have known the dangers associated with asbestos and taken precautions. Manville used this defense, often successfully, in cases filed during the next four decades. In addition, Manville continued to argue into the 1980s that until 1964 there was no known reason to warn insulation workers of the dangers of working with asbestos. Plaintiffs countered that warning labels should have been in use as early as the 1950s.
In 1930, Dr. A.J. Lanza of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company began a four-year study, Effects of Inhalation of Asbestos Dust upon the Lungs of Asbestos Workers. Based on his findings, in late 1933 Lanza recommended that JM perform dust counts at its plants. Vandiver Brown, who served as Manville's vice-president, corporate secretary, and chief attorney, wrote Lanza to request changes in his report. Specifically, Brown requested that he downplay the negative implications of asbestos exposure. In his book, Outrageous Misconduct: The Asbestos Industry on Trial, Paul Brodeur described a memo Brown wrote in 1935 to company colleagues in which he noted a speaker who said, "The strongest bulwark against future disaster for the industry is the enactment of properly drawn occupational-disease legislation, which would eliminate the jury as well as eliminate the shyster lawyer and the quack doctor since fees would be strictly limited by the law." Later that year, Brown wrote that the company's best interests would be served by having asbestosis receive minimal publicity. Brown's correspondence would be entered as evidence in trials almost a half century later by plaintiffs who, in efforts to win punitive as well as compensatory damages against the company, contended that JM deliberately downplayed the effects of exposure.
British studies concurrent with Lanza's encouraged Parliament to pass legislation to protect asbestos workers in 1931. In the United States, three years passed before asbestosis was considered for classification as a disease under workmen's compensation laws.
Beginning in 1936, JM and nine other asbestos companies funded a study of the effects of asbestos on animals. Dr. LeRoy U. Gardner reported significant changes in the lungs of guinea pigs within a year after exposure to asbestos dust. Gardner died in 1946 before formally reporting his findings.
In 1939, L.H. Brown became president of JM, a position he held until 1948, and H.E. Manville stepped down as chairman. The year 1940 was significant as the first year in which the name Manville did not appear in the list of company officers. In 1941, H.E. Manville, Jr. joined the board of directors, a post he held into the 1960s.
Growth Continues in the Prewar and Postwar Eras
At the start of World War II, JM was among the world's leading suppliers of asbestos, and 1939 through 1945 were strong years for JM financially. During those years, tens of thousands of workers in U.S. government shipyards and other installations used thousands of tons of asbestos in building ships and airplanes. In 1943, the Navy Department and the U.S. Maritime Commission published a study that outlined the risks to insulation workers of high asbestos dust levels. Minimum Requirements for Safety and Industrial Health in Contract Shipyards reported that asbestosis could arise from breathing asbestos in any job that created dust. Many of the workers and seaman exposed to asbestos during this period would bring suit against JM years later.
In 1947, JM signed the first in a series of policies with the Travelers Insurance Company, the company's insurers for the next 30 years. The extent of the insurers' liability in the asbestos suits would be debated and litigated well into the 1990s.
In 1948, L.H. Brown became chairman of the board, while R.W. Lea was named president. Three years later, L.M. Cassidy, formerly vice-president of sales, assumed the position of chairman; a second vice-president, A.R. Fisher, became president and a third, C.F. Rassweiler, was named vice-chairman. These men controlled the company until 1957.
From 1950 through 1970, JM's sales grew at an average annual rate of 4 percent. While sales of asbestos and other raw materials represented only 13 percent of JM's volume, they contributed between 30 percent and 40 percent of earnings.
In 1951, John A. McKinney joined the company as a patent lawyer; he was to become president 25 years later. By 1952, the staff included Fred L. Pundsack, Chester E. Shepperly, Monroe Harris, and Chester J. Sulewski, all of whom, along with McKinney, figured prominently in the bankruptcy court protection program some 30 years later. In 1958, JM acquired L-O-F Glass Fibers Company, which then became known as the Manville Sales Corporation. Francis H. May, Jr. of Libbey-Owens-Ford Glass Company joined Manville and became Executive Vice-president for Finance and Administration. Fisher was named chairman as well as president.
During the 1950s, JM workers who came into contact with insulation on job sites began filing workmen's compensation claims against the company. The company's first-hand knowledge of the dangers of asbestos would become a factor in future suits in which it would be a defendant.
In 1960, Clinton Brown Burnett became president of JM, a post he held for a decade. Burnett headed the company during a period of rising production costs and price declines. In response, he trimmed operations by closing plants and assembly lines. He led the company through cautious diversification into fiberglass, carpeting, and gypsum, opened a building materials research and development center in New Jersey, and expanded vigorously overseas.
Addressing Challenges in the 1960s
During the 1960s, asbestos received increasing attention from the medical community. In 1963, Dr. I.J. Selikoff of Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York reported to the American Medical Association the findings of his study of the effects of asbestos on workers. Selikoff estimated that 100,000 U.S. workers and their family members would die of diseases associated with asbestos in the twentieth century. That study, coupled with the news coverage that followed, brought the problem to the public's attention. In 1964, for the first time, JM agreed to place warning labels on its products. The labels read, "Inhalation of asbestos in excessive quantities over long periods of time may be harmful."
By 1969, Burnett, now 62, and the board of directors were looking for solutions to two problems: JM's slow growth over the preceding ten years and the lack of an heir apparent to succeed the president when he retired. William C. Stolk, a director since 1951, recommended W. Richard Goodwin, a 45-year-old management consultant with a doctorate in experimental psychology, for help in solving the first problem and, potentially, the second. Goodwin began counseling JM in June 1968. He joined the company as Vice-president for Corporate Planning in April 1969 and was named president in December 1970. Burnett became chairman of the board, only to retire about a month later. He left Goodwin with a solid company, having $145 million in working capital, no long-term debt, and a leading position in environmental control, building materials, and asbestos.
Goodwin immediately implemented the changes he had recommended during his consultancy. He formed a three-man management team, composed of himself and JM veterans Francis May and John B. Jobe, Executive Vice-president for Operations. May and Jobe ran the company while Goodwin concentrated on growth. He led the company into real estate development, recreation, irrigation systems, and construction. Sales rose 91 percent from 1970 to 1975; profits rose 115 percent between 1970 and 1974, and earnings in 1976 set a company record. In 1974, JM's international division, with 22 plants and four mines in 12 countries and sales offices worldwide, generated 32 percent of corporate net profit on 14 percent of gross sales.
In 1973, Manville and its co-defendants lost their final appeal in Clarence Borel v. Fibreboard Paper Products Company, et al. The case would be a turning point in asbestos litigation, for the jury found the defendants guilty of contributory negligence. It also awarded the plaintiff damages based on the contention that the companies knew of the dangers inherent in working with the product. In upholding the verdict, the U.S. Appeals Court wrote what was described in Strategic Management as a scorching indictment of the defendants.
One of Goodwin's major contributions to JM was his decision to move the company from Madison Avenue in New York. Goodwin selected the Ken-Caryl cattle ranch, 15 miles from downtown Denver, Colorado, as the site for the new headquarters. When completed, the new building was described in Business Week as "ultramodern. ... [The building] juts out like a landlocked ocean liner in a mountain canyon." The building was a tangible reminder that JM's style had changed drastically.
Goodwin never worked at the new location. Just two weeks prior to its completion, he was summoned to New York to meet with the board of directors. On September 1, 1976, Goodwin, Francis May, and other aides flew in and were met by John A. McKinney, a senior vice-president and the company's top legal officer by this time. The next evening, William F. May, John P. Schroeder, and Charles J. Zwick, members of the board of directors, met with Goodwin. Schroeder explained that they represented the nine outside directors on JM's 12-member board and that they all wanted his resignation. Goodwin was surprised but acquiesced. The terms of his separation agreement prevented him from ever discussing his departure or the reasons for it. Industry observers speculated that Goodwin's management style was too casual or flamboyant for the conservative board and that once he got the company moving in the right direction, the directors replaced him. The next morning, John A. McKinney, who did not know in advance that the board sought to remove Goodwin, was appointed the new president of JM. Fortune quoted McKinney as saying, "It happened so fast, I almost missed it."
1970s: Focusing on Profits under McKinney
Under Goodwin, JM had stressed growth; under McKinney, JM stressed profits. During his first year as president, McKinney eliminated unprofitable diversification and expanded asbestos and fiberglass capacity. One of his early acts as president was to elevate Fred L. Pundsack, a 24-year JM veteran, to Executive Vice-president of Operations, on equal footing with Francis May. Pundsack's directive was to maximize profits.
McKinney quickly earned a reputation as a tough negotiator. In 1977, Quebec threatened to nationalize the company's Jeffrey mine, the world's largest asbestos mine. McKinney put JM's $77 million expansion plan on hold and took a hard line with Premier René Lévesque. Lévesque withdrew his proposal, and JM resumed its expansion plans. Later in the year, JM's fiberglass production suffered from a 102-day strike at its Defiance, Ohio, plant. The strike cost the company $7.5 million in lost revenues. McKinney stood his ground, and in October workers accepted the same offer they had rejected in September, by a two-to-one margin. In May 1977, McKinney was named chairman of the board and chief executive officer. Pundsack became president and chief operating officer.
In 1977, JM estimated that the $16 million available through primary coverage to settle outstanding asbestos suits would be depleted within two years. New case filings rose from 159 in 1976 to 792 in 1978. Cases were being settled at a faster pace as well, with an average cost to the company of $21,000, of which $15,400 was awarded to the plaintiff and the balance going for legal fees. As Travelers was unable to predict the scope and number of future suits, it refused to renew its policy for the 1977 fiscal year. JM was forced to insure itself.
By 1979, McKinney was spending half of his time on the asbestos problem. He continued to be a tough negotiator. In May 1979, a writer for Fortune stated, "Asbestos litigation is almost a separate business at JM." The company was a co-defendant in about 1,500 lawsuits brought by insulation workers who handled JM's products while working for other companies in construction or in the shipyards. At McKinney's insistence, JM sued the government to force it to indemnify the company against the suits from shipyard workers, as many of the claimants had worked with asbestos insulation during World War II and the Korean War in defense-related capacities.
In January 1979, JM completed its acquisition of Olinkraft Inc., a $447 million forest-products company, for about $600 million. W. Thomas Stephens, who was to have a lead role in JM's later bankruptcy reorganization, moved to JM from Olinkraft. Olinkraft, now operating as Manville Forest Products Corporation, owned 600,000 acres of timberlands in Louisiana, Arkansas, and Texas. It owned or leased another 100,000 acres in Brazil. Unexpectedly high start-up costs for Olinkraft, combined with a currency devaluation and tax increases in Brazil, caused JM's net income to fall 20 percent in the fourth quarter of 1979. Although its stock price fell 40 percent, Manville surpassed the $2 billion mark in sales for the first time.
Revenues in 1980 were on a par with those in 1979, with earnings dropping sharply in a weak construction market. The company remained heavily involved with asbestos. McKinney noted that asbestos and Manville were virtually synonymous and told Forbes in May 1980, "The day asbestos isn't good business for us, we'll get out of it." At the same time, he felt that Olinkraft, once past its initial problems, would shape the future of JM. In 1980, McKinney reported that the company remained optimistic in the face of mounting lawsuits, as the firm had been victorious in the majority of the cases that had thus far proceeded to trial.
Restructuring and Bankruptcy: 1980s
Effective October 30, 1981, JM's shareholders approved a reorganized corporate structure consisting of a new parent company, Manville Corporation, and five wholly separate operating subsidiaries: Manville Building Materials Corporation, Manville Forest Products Corporation, Manville International Corporation, Manville Products Corporation, and Johns-Manville Corporation. Johns-Manville shareholders retained their stock, which was converted to Manville Corporation stock on a share-for-share basis.
As of December 31, 1981, Manville was a defendant or co-defendant in approximately 9,300 asbestos suits brought by 12,800 individuals. Juries were making large awards in punitive damages, which were not covered by insurance. By 1982, settlements approximated $40,000 per case, including legal fees. Manville's consultants estimated that over the course of the next 20 years the company could be liable for 32,000 cases in addition to the 16,500 that had already been filed. Possible litigation costs were estimated at $2 billion, twice the company's assets at the time. By 1985, 19,750 claims had been filed against the company. In addition, Manville was alleged to be liable for asbestos-removal property-damage claims. Manville repeatedly filed appeals to postpone payments in suits it had lost. McKinney continued to assert that the government must pay a portion of the claims arising from exposure in the shipyards and other government jobs.
On August 26, 1982, in light of the asbestos litigation and posted losses in the first and second quarters of the year, Manville filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. While under bankruptcy court protection, Manville's earnings for the first nine months from continuing operations improved from $10 million to $59 million. Legal expenses, however, increased apace: legal costs rose from $1 million for a period of nine months in 1982 and 1983 to $11 million for the same period a year later.
After a dozen court-granted postponements, Manville proposed its reorganization plan on November 21, 1983. The plan was produced unilaterally, since attempts at a negotiated settlement with asbestos victims' representatives had failed. At that time, Manville proposed to split itself into two companies: the first would handle the business and the second would possess few assets yet all of the liability for the asbestos claims. Manville would be insulated from any and all claims. All cash, after operating expenses, would be funneled to the second company. Suits would be settled by the company out of court. Concurrently, Manville left the asbestos business, selling its last plant in 1985.
Leon Silverman, court-appointed attorney for unknown future asbestos claimants, helped orchestrate the final reorganization plan, filed on February 14, 1986. This plan resembled the earlier proposal with these amendments: the second company became two trusts, one for personal injury--the health fund--and the other for property-damage claims. The trusts would be funded through cash, future earnings, stock, bonds, and insurance payments worth at least $2.5 billion. Initially, the health-fund trust was to receive $1 billion. Beginning in 1992, Manville would have to pay the health fund $75 million a year. The property-damage trust was to be funded initially with $125 million, with additional funds available. Furthermore, plaintiffs retained the right to a jury trial if they disagreed with the determination made by the trusts. The plan seemed to satisfy the claimants but at considerable expense to Manville common stock owners, who saw their investment becoming virtually worthless under the plan. On neither side was there agreement that the trusts were viable solutions. Michael L. Goldberg, attorney for 700 asbestos claimants, estimated in 1988 that the trusts would be almost $200 million short by 1992.
In 1986, McKinney resigned and Josh T. Hulce, who had been president since 1984, abruptly quit. George Dillon, a Manville director for 17 years, became chairman and W. Thomas Stephens was tapped to become president and chief executive officer. Stephens, formerly an industrial engineer with Olinkraft and Manville's chief financial officer during the preceding three years, was credited with playing a pivotal role in bringing Manville out of bankruptcy. One of Stephens's first moves as president was to establish small meetings with Manville employees, who, like the public and the stockholders, had lost faith in the company. Stephens reassured them that Manville would continue to operate much as it had in the past. He intended to concentrate on its core businesses and generate enough cash flow over the next years to fund the trust. Profits doubled in 1987 to a record $164 million.
Late 1980s Turnaround
In 1988, Manville emerged from bankruptcy. The Chapter 11 filing forced Manville to reexamine the way it conducted its business. Extensive in-house restructuring resulted in a policy of encouraging more decision-making from the company's various components. Incentive programs were also instituted.
After three full years of trimming operations, Manville was again a healthy company with new product lines. It moved out of its headquarters into smaller spaces in Denver and reinvested the concomitant savings in plant upgrading. In the November 1988 issue of Business Month, Stephens stated, "Two back-to-back years of record performance should send out a signal pretty loud and clear that we're stronger than ever."
One of Manville's subsidiaries, Atlanta-based Riverwood International, was a rising star in the paper industry stock market. A producer of lumber, containerboard, and clay-coated paperboard for the beverage and food industries, Riverwood made 50 to 60 percent of the paper beer cartons in the United States. The company also manufactured 20 to 30 percent of all paper containers made for soft drinks. Riverwood became a public company in June 1992 when it sold 12.1 million shares of stocks. Manville, however, still controlled 80 percent of the company.
By 1990, almost 130,000 claims had been filed and the Manville Personal Injury Settlement Trust ran out of funds. The dearth of cash was due to the rapid pace of claims settlement, many of which were delayed during Manville's bankruptcy. The Fund trustees, headed by Director Marianna Smith, proposed three cost-cutting measures. First, the Fund would refuse to pay post-judgment interest whenever plaintiffs contested their trust settlements. Second, settlements and court-order judgments would be paid in installments rather than in lump sums. Third, the Trust would declare that funds were not subject to attachment or levy by the court. Attorneys for the plaintiffs argued that the Fund trustees did not have the authority to implement such restrictions and called for Manville to liquidate the Trust's 24 million shares, worth approximately $1 billion. Although the company accelerated a $50 million payment to the trust, it was revealed that the claims that had been settled would not be paid for almost 20 years, long after many of the claimants had died. In July 1990, the court imposed a payments freeze while the company tried to determine how to handle the situation. In September 1990, Manville agreed to add up to $520 million to the asbestos fund during the next seven years.
Manville suffered great public relations setbacks as a result of the asbestos lawsuits. In an annual Fortune magazine poll of America's most admired companies, Manville finished last for five consecutive years, from 1987 to 1991. In an effort to regain the public's trust, Manville began to regularly monitor the health of its employees with a computer tracking system. In addition, Manville placed cautionary labels on any of its products that had been found to contain possible carcinogens. This procedure hurt sales, particularly in Japan, where packages with cancer warnings were initially refused entry into the country.
Manville spent the majority of the 1990s restructuring in an attempt to revamp its image. During 1991, the firm adopted a holding company structure with two main business units. Manville Sales Corporation--renamed Schuller International Group Inc. in 1992--oversaw its fiberglass operations and Manville Forest Products operated the company's forest products business.
In 1993, Schuller entered into an agreement with Owens Corning Fiberglass in which Schuller acquired its commercial and industrial roofing business, while selling its residential roofing business to Owens Corning. The company also acquired Steinachglas, a German glass mat producer.
The firm appeared to be digging out of its asbestos problems by the mid-1990s. The Bankruptcy Act of 1994 included a provision that stated Schuller was permanently shielded from any asbestos liability, which started to put many investors' minds at ease. At the same time, a new settlement method for the Trust was approved by the District Court of New York in 1995. Schuller launched an initial public offering of $400 million senior notes in late 1994. The proceeds were filtered back to the Trust.
During this time period, the firm sold off its interests in Riverwood International Corporation and Stillwater Mining Company. Fueled by these sales, the company began making strategic acquisitions. It added Nord Bitumi, Dibiten USA, Web Dynamics, and NRG Barriers to its arsenal in 1996, bought Ergon Nonwovens the following year, and Exeltherm and Tasso AB in 1998. It also began building new manufacturing facilities in the United States and expanded into Poland and China.
Manville changed its name to Schuller Corporation in 1996. The new name did not stick, however, and shareholders agreed to revert back to Johns Manville Corporation in 1997. As CEO Jerry Henry--who replaced Stephens in 1996--commented in an April 1997 Wall Street Journal article, "People were asking me what this Schuller company was." He added, "Wouldn't we be better off with a name with so much more recognition?" While many industry analysts balked at the decision to take a name that was practically synonymous with asbestos, Henry stood firmly behind the corporate moniker believing JM would be more successful with its original name.
As JM pushed forward with its growth plans, the Trust announced in 1999 that it wanted to sell its shares in order to fund the $250 million it was paying in claims each year. In June 2000, Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst Inc. and Bear Stearns Cos. agreed to acquire JM for $2.4 billion. The slowing economy and weak earnings forced the parties to call off the deal in early December. Later that month, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. offered $1.96 billion for JM. The purchase, completed in 2001, was Berkshire's fourth materials acquisition in just over a year. Berkshire's legendary chairman and CEO, Warren Buffet, was known for his attraction to market leaders, and by now JM had strong footing in the commercial and industrial fiberglass insulation and roofing systems industries. To Buffet, JM was a perfect fit.
Under its new parent, JM was afforded the financially stability to continue its growth strategy. In 2001, it added Slovakian fiberglass manufacturing concern Skloplast a.s. to its holdings. The company remained focused on bolstering its product lines while at the same time maintaining high levels of customer satisfaction. The Berkshire Hathaway purchase put JM on solid ground, leaving it to focus on a successful future in the years to come.

Originally published 5/15/07 in the FAQ, as Where do I go to find Free Cash Flow data on MSN?. This post will help you gather the FCF numbers to input into Excel or the Rule #1 Cash Flow Calculator -- so you can determine how much a company has grown its Free Cash over time.
Here's how to do it:
Let's use WFMI as an example:
Go to MSN.
Enter the stock symbol (WFMI) and hit Return. You get this screen, shown below. [Click on an image to see it larger in a pop-up window.]
Click on Financial Results > Statements (in the side bar). You will end up here.
Choose the tab marked "Cash Flow". You'll end up here.
Free Cash Flow is the cash a business has left over AFTER it subtracts what capital items it needs -- things like manufacturing plants and replacing machinery that broke.
To arrive at Free Cash Flow, you need to subtract Capital Expenditures from Cash from Operating Activities.
(FCF = Cash from Operating Activities - Capital Expenditures)
For the “Cash from Operating Activities” value, use the appropriate number from the line “Cash from Operating Activities”. See image below to learn where to find this line of information.
For the “Capital Expenditures” value, click on the blue arrow next to “Capital Expenditures” to expand the section. Underneath it, look for the line labeled “Purchase of Fixed Assets”.
Use this number, "Purchase of Fixed Assets", as your "Capital Expenditures" number.
You may note there are 5 years of numbers here (as mentioned in the book). Unfortunately, free sites like MSN are only offering 5 Year Data for Cash Flow. To go back further you'll have to either subscribe to a paid research tool or look up past years' statements in the Investor Relations section of the company website.
Now go play.
Recent CommentsThe disastrous shape of her home on Cape Cod, which Susan Blood has dubbed Trout Towers, and her role in that chaotic abode amid her husband and children and extended family and boarders and (assorted) pets is a source of much stress, embarrassment and confession, which is sublimated into joy, wisdom and humor in her cleverly crafted blog and now compiled into a book, “How Not to Do Things,” from Surface Popper Publications.
It’s a book of crisply written sentences (quite unlike the one previous), from which Blood will read in a program to benefit WOMR with her friend and fellow radio host, Ira Wood, at 7:30 p.m. on Thursday, Oct. 5, at Wellfleet Preservation Hall at 335 Main St. It is Wood, Blood says, who originally suggested she turn her blog posts into a book, when they were both on the WOMR board, “though I don’t think he realizes it’s his fault. He’s smart and funny, and I can’t believe my good luck in doing a reading with him.”
Blood has had a long-running once-a-month show on WOMR, “Opera Betty,” which, she says, is for people who hate opera, and that flip-flop of turning that which is unpleasant on the surface into something that is deliciously ripe is Blood’s forte. It’s not so much lemons into lemonade as it is locating the things about adult life that challenge her, and finding, if not the solution, then the silver lining. She has done it here, at the Banner, where she assists in the arts section and serves as occasional correspondent, as she has done it for publications local and far afield and for more than one arts institution on the Outer Cape.
Food metaphors are apt in describing Blood’s work, where the subject of eating and cooking and gardening and fitting into bathing suits is frequent.
“I love food so much,” Blood says. “The chapter on ‘How Not to Get a Job’ has a bit about food and writing. It turns out I can’t write without snacks. Who knew? When I was laid off last year I ate every single feeling on the planet. I also wrote a book.”
She was born in New England, moved to Colorado with her family as a kid, and came to Cape Cod as an act of will, just because she wanted to. With her husband, Chris, a sound engineer, she has built a life here. It’s taken a lot of work, at home and professionally, but Blood dismisses praise for her industriousness, which is much in evidence in her book, though her efforts often go unrewarded.
“I wouldn’t go so far as to call it a work ethic,” she says. “Chris and I both have these careers that don’t end at the door. It’s what we do. Every time I try to get into a routine, like writing for a couple of hours in the morning before work, I ruin everything. We just keep doing things when they need to be done. I don’t write blog posts on my website regularly — only when they fall whole cloth out of the sky into my head, at which point I stop what I’m doing and write it down. In Buddhism, there is a thing called Right Livelihood. I’m not motivated by money or glory — although I would not say no to either — I’m Right Livelihood motivated. As long as I’m contributing, it’s all good. And it’s better than housework.”
Though the foibles of housework and raising kids are a centerpiece of “How Not to Do Things,” Blood takes on more serious and, at times, painful topics: tending to her ailing, live-in mother-in-law, for example, or dealing with her own mother’s decline, and surviving cancer herself. Her spirit is always a bit saucy, though not glib, and she never tries her reader’s patience.
“Humor is how I deal with life,” she says. “I have no use for wallowing unless it’s funny. I leave a lot of stuff out because it has stopped mattering. It’s not a specific intention to gloss over uncomfortable or unflattering things, but as with any editing, you take out what doesn’t serve the story. I saw a jewelry demonstration of silver reticulation once, where someone melted sterling until the alloys rose to the surface. As the alloys burned off these tiny balls of fine silver appeared. I’m going for the silver. Or gold. I’d be OK with gold.”News

“In this design, the life cycle of a plant is shown, making visible the flower, bud, stem, foliage, seed, bulb, roots. At least four parts of the life cycle of the plant material must be used.
The design should not appear contrived and should emphasise the beauty of the flowers in their own natural environment.”Today is the best day of Mari’s life. She is about to receive a gift beyond her wildest dreams – a house. The 16ft x 20ft house with a loft, a concrete floor, four sturdy walls, and a leak-free roof is more than the single mother of three could ever have imagined for herself. Jenna Montgomery, Communications Manager for International Relief Teams, spent the day with Marri, and saw her dreams come true.
Jenna shares her experience and Mari’s life changing moment with us below:
At 6 am on Saturday morning, when I would normally be in bed, I was on my way south of the border to Tijuana, Mexico. With 25 International Relief Teams’ volunteers, all sacrificing their weekend and precious time with their families to give one family a better future, we caravanned in three large vehicles across the border to the newly-formed settlement community of Colonia Fuentes del Valle.
As we approached the community, we bumped along a dirt road, spraying large dust clouds behind us and drove into a sea of small shacks made from scrap materials. One hundred and fifty families now live here, mostly migrants from central Mexico searching for better opportunities. The cost of living, school expenses, and low wages often leaves these families with insufficient funds to build houses. There is no running water, sewer lines, schools, or medical services.
The newly-formed settlement community of Colonia Fuentes del Valle.
When we pulled up to Mari’s small plot, I saw her standing in front of her shack with a gaggle of excited kids and neighbors, all waiting anxiously for our arrival. Her eyes glimmered with tears when I introduced myself – she couldn’t believe we were all here just for her.
Mari’s current home is a tiny two-room structure made of old garage doors, tarps, and with dirt floors. While the volunteers got to work on the construction, Mari showed me around.
We sat in the “kitchen”, a space just big enough for us to stand in, while children filed in and out, running and yelling in excitement. The room has a kid-sized table with two chairs, and an improvised countertop with a single pot filled with ears of corn ready to be made into tamales later that day. Mari said cooking in a kitchen with dirt floors meant it was impossible to keep dirt out of the food.
Next, Mari took me outside and into the “bedroom”, a room not much bigger than the kitchen and which only contained a single bunkbed. Mari explained she used the top bunk to store their clothes and all four of them slept together on the bottom bunk. Sleeping on the bottom bunk also helped protect them from getting wet when it rained.
Mari’s children, 10-year-old Kevin, 6-year-old Dulce Abril and 4-year-old Emmanuel, each told me they were most excited about sleeping in the loft in their new house that night. Dulce Abril (which means Sweet April) clung to her mother when she wasn’t running around with the other little girls.
After spending the whole day with this family, I noticed the four of them never strayed too far from one another – they even helped paint the frames of their new house together. They have a very special and sweet bond. Sleeping in a single bed together every night is bound to do that!
Mari then told me her story, her eyes shining with tears as she remembered the hard times.
She was born in Mexico City but was raised in Tijuana. When Mari’s mother came to visit later in the day, she told me she moved her family to Tijuana because she knew she could find a job here, and has been able to work in a factory building electrical plugs to support her family.
When Mari was 18, she met the father of her children and had Kevin, followed by Dulce, and then little Emmanuel. They split up over six years ago and Mari has been a single mom ever since. About a year and three months ago, she decided to move out of her mother’s house because she wanted to have her own space for herself and her kids, as her mother’s house was very crowded.
Mari, at 28, is the oldest of seven children. She moved to Fuentes del Valle with two of her sisters when the neighborhood was just starting out.
Mari said she feels lucky to have her family close by to help her raise her children. Mari said she makes her living by selling beauty products and doing odd jobs for her neighbors to earn a few extra pesos.
Throughout the day, Mari and I watched the IRT volunteers raise the walls of her new home. We watched them roll on the bright purple paint (chosen by Dulce Abril), install the roof, hang new curtains, set their new table with their new plates, cups and silverware, and set out the new blankets and pillows in the loft.

Then the time came for the family to check out their home for the first time. Mari’s eyes gleamed, as they had all day, and the kids looked like it was Christmas morning.
I was amazed when Dulce squealed with delight over her brand new pillow – she never had a pillow before.
“I will sleep well for this first time in my life tonight because I finally have a pillow,” she said.
The family, neighbours and the IRT volunteer team outside Mari’s new house
At the end of the day, when I handed the keys over to Mari, she could hardly find words to express her gratitude through her tears. She said she felt hopeful for her children’s future for the first time. She knew this house would help keep them protected from the wind and the rain. It meant dirt would not get in their food. It meant they would sleep well at night and would be ready to concentrate at school the next day. It meant hope for a brighter future.

My design is not based on numbers, but its still easy to tell time.
The widest bar is hours 0-24, the smaller one is minutes 0-60 and the smallest is seconds 0-60. The display consists of many cube-shaped LED diodes which is extruded slightly from the background and covered by scratch resistant glass. The strap is joined together on the bottom with a adjustable link that snap together with neodymium magnets (or regular hook system If the fabrication is problematic). The magnet system is inspired by the iPads “smart cover”. The watch is also supposed to be USB rechargeable, and it should be possible to set the time via USB also.
I think people who are in to scifi or people who like cool gadgets with a good design, or the general pop culture would like to wear it. This watch is designed for people who like a clean design, in other words it looks good in both a casual and formal situation. Because of the modern contemporary design it fits in anywhere. The watch can be a bit masculine, but looks good on both genders according to tests I have done.
My design stands out because of the simple and elegant design, and the magnetic link that many people will think is a cool detail, which is a little bit different from other watches. My design is also a bit more “adult” than the other designs. If I were to compare it to anything, I had to say that it is somewhere in between the Changing Lanes LED Watch and the Seven LED Watch. The way the face of the watch tells time is also completely different from anything on the website.

- BELLA FIGURA: More than just a pretty face, Lucrezia knows how to make a fine first impression. She is skilled in the rules of etiquette and capable of conducting herself appropriately in a variety of formal situations - from meeting royalty to hosting a fancy dinner party. (Conversely, this also means she knows how NOT to act if she's looking to make a scene.)
- ENTOMOLOGICAL INTIMACY: Her Evolved ability brings with it an intrinsic intimacy with the entomological world but Lucrezia has also striven to increase her book knowledge about the creatures she so often interacts with. She's schooled in the habitats, diets, behaviors, and communication methods of a vast variety of insects and arachnids the world over.
- MODI SEDUCENTI: Lucrezia is an actress and she most certainly knows how to perform. She can lie with a straight face, tap into a reservoir of crocodile tears on cue, and pretend to be everything or nothing that someone else might want her to be. Seductive ways, indeed.
- SWISS BANK ACCOUNT: Someone got some good advice when she was just starting out and, instead of blowing her movie-made millions on frivolous things, Lucrezia saved up her little lire in a Swiss bank account. After nearly three decades in the film industry, it's pretty safe to say that she'll never have to work another day in her life and she'll still be able to eat filet mignon morning, noon, and night. She's got money. A LOT of money.
- WORLD TRAVELER: Like many Europeans, Lucrezia speaks several languages. In addition to her native tongue (Italian), she is also fluent in English and French. She knows enough Spanish to hold a casual conversation and has a smattering of German in her linguistic arsenal.

If you’re reading this, it means you’d like to know how to say ‘water’ in Russian. I wish I could just lie to you and tell you the word is ‘vaDAH’ and be done with it. Unfortunately, nothing in Russian is that simple. ‘VaDAH’ is ONE way you’ll hear it. The other two ways are:
VOHdu and vahDEE.
It just depends on context. If you’re walking along the street and want to point to some water and exclaim, “Water!” then you’d say, “VaDAH!”
If you’re in a restaurant and want to order water, you’d say, “VOHdu.”
Finally, if you want to offer someone some water — emphasis on some — you’d say, “VahDEE.”
This is typical of the Russian language, where the emphasis shifts depending on which form of the word you’re using. And it’s a bit of a nuisance. Imagine if English did that. Imagine if we said, “One baNAna. Two banaNAS.” But don’t sweat it too much. Make your best guess and hope for the best.
Getting back to water: No one seems to drink it straight out of the faucet. If the locals are afraid of it, so am I. This means you end up buying a lot of bottled water. I always make it my first task, after buying a map of the city, to go out and buy some jugs of purified water…
…if I can remember which word to use.

Homesites were priced from $500,000 to $1.2 million. Today there are no homes completed and the developer is in default on a $675 million Credit Suisse loan.
Land Resource, L.L.C., a privately held company, began selling lots in their 3,917 mountain acre Grey Rock at Lake Lure project in 2005. Prices ranged from $200 to $700 thousand. Today there are no homes completed and Land Resource closed their sales office in July 2008.
Privately held companies are generally not obliged to reveal financial information but developers selling land under the Interstate Land Sales Full Disclosure Act are required to submit copies of their Corporate Charters and financial statements. This information is available for public inspection.
Under federal law, developers must give each purchaser a detailed Subdivision Property Report. All Property Reports must state the following:
A restriction or an encumbrance on your lot, or on the Subdivision, could adversely affect title to your lot.A developer must list all encumbrances, mortgages, and liens. For instance the April 25, 2008 Laurelmor Property Report disclosed that “a first and second mortgage in favor of Credit Suisse, Cayman Islands Branch, encumbers the property subject to this Property Report.”?"

Finding the right oil supplier is very important, especially if you are looking for stability in your business. Fuel supply is essential to ensuring steadiness in your business. In case the fuel supply is delayed, conventional business operations might have to be halted completely. If you are not satisfied with your current fuel supplier and are looking to switch, the following pieces of advice will help you find the right supplier for the job. Here are some important factors that you should consider before signing a long-term deal with a supplier.
Delivery Timings
First of all, you should make sure that the delivery timings coincide with your business operations. Most businesses have very specific requirements when it comes to their fuel needs. You should make sure that the fuel supplier’s lead times are suitable for you. In case the lead times are longer than you expect, your business operations will hit a snag. You should contact the company’s representative and find out their delivery schedule. Most companies usually offer delivery on request as well, so you can place a custom order at regular intervals. Furthermore, most homeowners also require home heating oil, so it is important that you check whether the company will deliver on time.
Prices
Reputable fuel suppliers such as Hobbs Bros usually offer a very low price for various types of oils and fuels. Since you will be ordering in bulk, you can also ask if the prices will differ accordingly. It is important that you hire a company that offers the lowest possible rate in order to maximise your profit margins. You can request quotes from different companies so that you are able to compare the rates in more detail. This will allow you to get a better idea about how much you will have to pay. For instance, farmers generally need a regular supply of agricultural fuel. It is vitally important that you compare rates and choose the company that offers the lowest rates. If you consistently have to order home heating oil for your place, you will obviously want to keep the prices as low as possible.
Heating Oil Grades
For those who live in rural areas and don’t have direct access to a gas pipeline, using heating oil is the only way to heat their homes. However, you should know that the various grades of heating oil are quite different. Higher grade heating oils, while a bit more expensive, will last you much longer. When requesting a quote from a company, you should ask if the quote is all-inclusive. You will want to make sure that there are no hidden costs or additional amounts that you will have to pay. The price should also include the VAT and other taxes charged by the company. Go through the heating oil grades first before making a decision about where you order from. These are just some of the important factors that you should consider when considering which fuel supplier to work with. Simple research could save you a great deal of money.I love to make soups when Fall starts, they are easy to make and always comforting on a cool night.

When I had called to attempt to schedule an appointment I had asked to be fitted in ASAP since I would be going out-of-town soon and did not want a tooth crisis while in Atlanta. And when I told her I was going to a writer’s conference where best-selling writers rubbed elbows with the rest of us and taught us about craft and the business she was impressed. She also told me that she had started to write a book as well and it was fiction (not a dental manual like I first assumed, bad person that I am).
I think there is something magical about the idea of writing. When I tell people that I write, many (not all) declare that they have always wanted to write a book. And I smile and tell them that if they have the fire to do it then go for it. Most people never put a pen to paper or fingers to keyboard to write their ‘Great American Novel’. And of those who do start a book, many do not finish. So why am I telling you this? Because as I prepare for the upcoming convention and my nerves start to jangle, I remind myself that I have accomplished something pretty AWESOME. Something that many people, who have the best intentions, never complete.
In other words I am giving myself a pep talk and you are along for the ride. I have professed in previous blogs the evil that is self-doubt and so I pat myself on the back (figuratively) and tell myself that I have finished several books and am going to have a BLAST at the conference celebrating my Golden Heart ® final whether I win or not. I have already gained a host of new contacts and I hope also new friends from the finalists who are a wonderful and diverse group of women.
So as I run full steam ahead over the next two weeks before leaving for Georgia, I stop to take a deep breath and remind myself that I am a winner any way you slice it. (okay, pep talk is now done).Quick academic help

The Union won the war and most of the south was destroyed.
The lack of unity was present because most of the amendments, laws and rules passed during reconstruction were created to protect and ensure the rights of African Americans.
With no soldiers or watch in the south they were able to commit all the acts of racism they wanted and nothing was done to stop racism until the 1950's.
This was one of four main events that promoted racism in the south.
By the time the last federal troops had been withdrawn in 1877, Reconstruction was all but over and the Democratic Party controlled the destiny of the South.

I could not let it pass without remembering first and foremost our Heavenly Father. Without Him we are nothing! Thank you dear God for sending your son to die for our sins, so we can spend eternity with you! "John 3:16"
And I could not let the day go by without remembering my Dad. I wanted to share this poem with everyone. I wrote this a year or two after my Dad passed. He was a very special person, I can still see his smirky grin and hear his laugh. He spent the last 8 years of his life in a nursing home with senile dementia. It was a hard time, but I could always get that grin and laugh out of him. He was my hero and I still miss him! So if you still have your Dad, give them an extra hug for me today! Happy Father's Day Daddy!
My Dad
He stood about five feet four
A fairly good size man
But oh, he was so much more
I was his biggest fan!
We always had a roof over our head
And plenty of food to eat
It could go without being said
Family needs he always did meet.
There was always love in his eyes
Even tho it was not always spoken
He seemed so friendly and so wise
That was one of his greatest tokens.
He was as calm as he could be
Unless you crossed his path
Then he would talk till you could see
The road you were on would lead to wrath.
I never remember him raising a hand
Or speakin’ an unkind word
He was actually as gentle as a lamb
And almost as quiet as a bird.
I was always Daddy’s little girl,
the only one he ever had.
Until time passed by in a whirl
I had my little girl, He was so glad.
His heart she did capture
Papa this, and Papa that.
he did listen to her that’s for sure
So much love, imagine that.
I could go on and on and on
And tell you about my Dad!
There are so many memories to think upon
They tend to make me sad.
But Dad is in Heaven now
At times I miss him so much.
But I will make it thru somehow
Till I too feel the Father’s touch.

5 months agoA recent study shows that stable angina patients who exercise are less likely to die from heart attacks (J Am Coll Cardiol, Oct 3, 2017;70(14):1689-1700). Stable angina means that you may or may not have chest discomfort or pain at rest, but pain occurs or worsens when you exert yourself such as walking up stairs, walking faster or lifting something heavy. Usually the pain worsens when you try to exercise. The study followed 5,486 patients with stable angina for an average of 3.7 years. Those who exercised regularly were 30 percent less likely to die during the follow-up period than those who did not exercise, and the more they exercised, the greater their survival rate. The editorial accompanying the article recommended that walking 10 minutes a day briskly or 15–20 minutes slowly can reduce chances for dying by almost one third.
This study agrees with the findings from an earlier review of 63 studies that included 14,486 people suffering from heart disease, aged 47 to 71 years, which showed that exercise was associated with reduced chances of hospitalization for heart disease or dying from a heart attack (Cochrane Database Syst Rev, Jan 5, 2016). Another review of 33 trials of 4740 people showed that people in heart failure who exercised had a reduced heart attack rate and death rate after one year, and a reduced number of heart failure-specific hospitalizations. They also showed improved exercise capacity and quality of life. However, this review did not find a reduced rate of heart attacks before one year (Cochrane Database Syst Rev, 2014 Apr 27;(4):CD003331).
Every year, more than 790,000 Americans suffer heart attacks. Of these cases, 580,000 are suffering their first attack while 210,000 are having repeat attacks (Report From the American Heart Association, 2017;135:e1–e458). Exercise helps to prevent and treat heart attacks, and reduces the two most common risk factors: overweight and diabetes.
Caution: Exercise can cause a heart attack in a person who has blocked or narrowed arteries. Check with your doctor before starting or increasing your exercise program. See How to Start an Exercise Program and Exercisers Have More Stable Plaques

Nearly everyone who works in education today is grappling with the same question: How do we prepare students to excel in jobs that don’t even exist yet? It’s true that every generation of students is the future, but the young people in today’s classrooms will get to reshape the landscape of technology and the economy in ways we can’t even comprehend yet, and they will require a new skill set to do so.
To tackle this problem head on, we decided to collaborate with local change makers and industry leaders to develop a culture of STEAM innovation that is replicable, scalable and impacts every school in our district.
Under the leadership of Bullis Charter School (BCS), California’s #1-ranked K-8 public school, and with the help of Autodesk, a leading software company, we created a year-long STEAM-based teacher development program that is revolutionizing professional development for our teachers and administrators.
We developed two different, specialized programs, both of which illustrate how project-based learning will build the “4C’s foundation” of our 21st-century learners: communication, collaboration, critical-thinking and creativity.
One track of the yearlong program is designed for teachers to expand their craft and bring fresh new ideas into their classrooms. Throughout the year, teachers from across Santa Clara County attend a series of hands-on workshops at BCS, which functions as a lab site where teachers learn engaging and practical methods for incorporating STEAM into their personal lesson plans. At BCS, they engage with teacher and student panels on lessons ranging from 3D printing to electronics and coding.
The second workshop program is designed for administrators to learn how to develop a school structure where project-based learning can thrive and be accessed by all, especially in under-resourced schools. The program has been extremely valuable for administrators who are in the process of creating new STEAM schools or transforming their current schools to STEAM-based programs.
As most people who have been through standard professional development programs have learned, the stand alone, one-stop-shop workshop has limited effectiveness. True development and innovation comes from growing a professional learning community that provides teachers and administrators with a strong support network. This year-long certification series helps teachers implement lessons from the workshops by creating upward communication channels where they can share best practices and innovative ideas beyond the scheduled workshops.
This program wasn’t developed overnight and is only one piece of the puzzle when it comes to preparing students for a 21st-century world. We’ve had our share of failures and successes as we’ve pushed to fully understand individualized and project-based learning, and STEAM integration. The result is a program that has empowered teachers and administrators to refine their own skills, while meeting the needs of educators who wanted to learn more about project-based learning but maybe didn’t have the resources to do so.
Our teachers and principals have responded overwhelmingly to the program and are experimenting with STEAM in new and exciting ways. For example, the principal of Steindorf STEAM Academy, a new magnet school in the Cambrian School District, utilized this certificate as preparation for opening the new school. She brought a cadre of teachers to learn about project-based learning and how to anchor it as a foundation to their school’s practice.
Our original intent in creating this program was to develop a model that is adaptable and replicable for all communities, so we believe this partnership model can be scaled far beyond the Silicon Valley. By joining together in our mutual missions to push for greater STEAM integration in the classroom, BCS, Autodesk and the Santa Clara County Office of Education have shown the rest of the nation what is possible with collaboration, and have provided the blueprint for how it can be accomplished.
We hope that our experience can be useful as a national case study on how to build a positive pipeline for K-12 education into the working].Walk In Shower Ideas images that posted in this website was uploaded by Iderma4.me.

[PHNOM PENH] Coca Cola Co opened a new US$100 million facility in Cambodian capital Phnom Penh on Monday to expand its production capacity in the South-east Asian nation..
Mr Hun Sen said Cambodia would have to train more human resources, build necessary infrastructure and supply cheap electricity to respond to rising interest in the country's industrial and light manufacturing sectors.

The bridge is usually a feature at the American Birkebeiner, the largest cross-country ski race in the country, held in Hayward, Wis. The Super Bowl Host Committee worked with the race’s foundation to bring the bridge downtown as a way to incorporate winter sports and recreation, according to Ben Popp, the Birkebeiner foundation’s executive director.
“We really want to showcase what happens in Minnesota in the winter,” Popp said as workers assembled the bridge in single-digit cold. “It’s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for a small nonprofit in Wisconsin.”
The bridge will stretch from 8th to 10th streets along Nicollet Mall, more than 14 feet tall and 24 feet wide above the 9th Street intersection. The structure weighs about 50,000 pounds.
Once the bridge is built, trucks will dump a foot of snow on it. The Loppet Foundation, a Minneapolis nonprofit that promotes outdoor activities for underserved youth, will coordinate a slew of activities across the bridge.
They will include free opportunities to try skiing, fat-tire biking and skijoring, a sport in which a person on skis is pulled by dogs. A machine will groom the snow each night.
“Anything that you can do in the winter in Minnesota on snow, we’re gonna try and do it over the bridge,” Popp said.
The bridge will be up by Sunday night, he said.
Known as the “International Bridge,” it has been used twice in the Birkebeiner race by skiers to cross Hwy. 63 in Hayward as they approach the finish line.
Vehicle traffic will run below the bridge on 9th Street. The bridge, which usually carries about 13,000 skiers, is “completely safe” to cross, Popp said.
Andrea Mokros, vice president of communications for the host committee, said NBC is expected to set up a studio in front of the bridge as a backdrop. The stage for the free “Super Bowl Live” concerts will be steps away on 8th Street.
For Mokros, the construction of the bridge is a welcome sight after years of planning.
“It’s just great to finally see something happening that makes it all very real,” she said.
The bridge will be up until Super Bowl Sunday, which is Feb. 4. Crews will then tear it down and build it back up weeks later in Hayward for the Birkebeiner events, scheduled this year for Feb. 22-25.

Upon learning this vital information, he immediately made plans to escape at the end of high school.
"I had no idea I had the option to leave," Davis said on Tuesday. "But Coach Hope laid out the rules and made it clear that despite what I've always been told by pasty, fat white people wearing Ohio State sweatshirts, it's actually acceptable -- even encouraged sometimes -- for kids who grow up here to play football elsewhere."
"It's opened up a whole new world to me," the 6'6" 270 pounder continued. "I always thought the NFL consisted of just the Browns and Bengals. Evidently, there's another team over in Indiana, too."
The defensive tackle -- Danny Hope's sixth commit to the class of 2010 -- runs only a 5.5 forty-yard-dash, so it will likely take him a while to exit the heart of it all.

A recent accident on the Beltway Inner Loop near Highway 270 and River Road led to injuries both to some people actually involved in the accident, as well as some of the emergency responders on hand at the scene of the crash.
According to the Maryland State Police, a team of EMTs was responding to an accident along Interstate 495 that had involved a pickup truck. While they were working at the accident scene, the driver of another pickup truck, Maximiliano A. Curcho of Clarksburg, somehow lost control of his vehicle and skidded across a couple lines, crossing into the shoulder and striking the EMTs. Before the truck finally came to a stop, it also struck the ambulance and the pickup truck that had already been involved in an accident.
It is unclear whether the three people who were injured in the first accident were also hit, but they were transferred to MedStar to receive treatment for the injuries they had already received. Both EMTs who were injured were taken to Suburban Hospital, as we Curcho. All of the injured parties are expected to survive their injuries.
The accidents were linked to treacherous road conditions on the freeway that night, with visibility low because of the combined darkness and wind blowing around precipitation. However, all drivers in those conditions still have a responsibility to drive safely and keep everyone else on the road safe from harmful situations.
If you have been seriously injured in a car accident, whether you were a driver, passenger or pedestrian, consult a skilled personal injury attorney with Mudd, Mudd & Fitzgerald, P.A. in La Plata, Maryland.Essay on poetry of the romantic revival

The companies have said that they unfairly urge adults to shun their lethal products and the warnings will cost them millions to produce.
Four of the five largest US tobacco companies sued the federal Government saying that the warnings violate their free speech rights.
The companies led by R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, Lorillard Tobacco Company, said the warnings no longer simply convey facts to allow people to make a decision on whether to smoke. They instead force them to put Government anti-smoking advocacy more prominently on their packs than on their own brands. They want a Judge to the labels.
One warning label which is a picture of a corpse with his chest sewed up and the words, “Smoking can kill you”, another label has a picture of a healthy pair of lungs beside a yellow and black pair with a warning that smoking causes fatal lung disease.
The lawsuit said that the images were manipulated to be especially emotional. The tobacco companies said the corpse photos were actually an actor with a fake scar while the healthy lungs were sanitized to make the diseased organ look worse.
Liam Moloney, personal injury Solicitor in Naas, Co. Kildare, said today, “It is important that all cigarette labels contain the most severe warnings as smoking is very dangerous for your health. If you have contracted lung disease as a result of smoking you may be entitled to seek compensation”.These were the reactions of our girl when she saw Ayah was live on TV.

The disc mires down in metallic grunge for most of its play, thanks to abrasive tracks from the Deftones, Stutterfly, Disturbed and an early Marilyn Manson song (before he realized that loud could also be catchy). The best track on the disc is the salaciously sigh-heavy "Cut Me Up," by popsters Har Mar Superstar. Also included are songs from the Prodigy, My Chemical Romance, Bloodsimple, the Von Bondies, and old tracks from the Stooges and the Joy Division.
On the racks also is the mostly symphonic soundtrack to The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy film from Hollywood Records. The disc includes a mix of movie dialogue snippets, upbeat and often humorously sci-fi orchestral score, musical show tunes and gospel R&B, thanks to Betty Wright and Al Green.
If you're looking for oldies, there are a host of "best of" collections out this month. Reprise has just released former Replacements singer Paul Westerberg's Besterberg: The Best of Paul Westerberg. The CD offers 20 tracks, led off by his biggest hit, "Dyslexic Heart," and includes a couple of previously unreleased songs.
Warner Music's Totally Hits series now offers the CD collection Totally Hits 2005, featuring 20 recent singles from Kelly Clarkson, Gavin DeGraw, Alicia Keys, Maroon 5, Ryan Cabrera, Avril Lavigne, Tweet and more.
Columbia's Legacy label has just unearthed a healthy dose of pop nostalgia with a bunch of "best of" sets and Essential collections. The 35th anniversary edition of Come On Get Happy! The Very Best of the Partridge Family features a young David Cassidy leading the TV show "family" on classic recordings of "Come On Get Happy" and "I Think I Love You," as well as a handful of never-before-released-on-CD songs (17 tracks in all).
Another pop heartthrob, Rick Springfield, is represented on a two-CD set Written in Rock, the Rick Springfield Anthology. Covering 35 years of recordings (who knew he was that old?) the collection features his early cover of "Eleanor Rigby," his moderate '70s hits "American Girls" and "Speak to the Sky," as well as his massive '80s hits "Jessie's Girl," "I've Done Everything for You," "Love Somebody," "Human Touch," and "Don't Talk to Strangers."
Legacy has four new entries in its "The Essential ..." series of artist collection CDs, featuring classic '60s folk and '70s rock material from Pete Seeger, Dion, Poco and Jefferson Airplane. The discs feature classics such as Seeger's "This Land Is Your Land," Dion's "The Wanderer" and "Runaround Sue," Jefferson Airplane's "Somebody to Love" and White Rabbit" and Poco's "Pickin' Up the Pieces."
New Order
Waiting for the Siren's Call
(Warner Bros.)
The premier British alternative pop-dance band is back for the first time in four years, and returns with one of its strongest releases ever.
Waiting for the Siren's Call offers a dozen upbeat tracks that celebrate Peter Hook's twining, trademark reverberating basslines and Bernard Sumner's casually smooth vocals.
From the keyboard slaloms of the mellowly urgent title track, to the sing-song hit hooks of "Hey Now What You Doing," and the throbbing techno-bassline and bell-tone keys of the disc's first single, "Krafty," which harks back to the days of the "Brotherhood" album, this CD is a sonic victory for New Order.
All of the musical strings they've unraveled in the past are wound together here, making Waiting for the Siren's Call a seamless experience from start to finish. Put this disc on and you'll be lured into the expansive world of delicious sound that only New Order can craft.
This is the first time Phil Cunningham, who was recruited to step in for Gillian Gilbert on their last tour, worked with the band on songwriting, something that may worry New Order purists. But the results are top-notch New Order. Gilbert had to leave the band a few years ago to care for her and drummer Stephen Morris' children, and apparently the leave of absence has become permanent.
While their last disc lacked a solid dance floor hit, Waiting for the Siren's Call has both jamming techno-rock tracks in "Who's Joe" and "Dracula's Castle," warm, kaleidescopic guitar flourishes in "Turn," as well as mixable hits such as "Krafty," "Guilt Is a Useless Emotion" and "Jetstream," a slowly pumping techno anthem that features Ana Matronic, from Scissor Sister, joining Sumner on vocals.
There are no filler tracks on Siren's Call; and the band apparently had such a productive writing session for the album that its press release claims it has enough extra tracks to fill in the bulk of another CD. From the throbbing stack of potential hits on this disc, it seems that the band may be starting yet another golden creative chapter in the long history of New Order. File and put in the root of your SDCard,like this SDCard/(PLACE DOWNLOADED TXT FILE HERE)

It should come as no great surprise that the best supplements for the brain are herbal, rather than being chemicals created in some lab somewhere. Drugs tend to be very strong and possess strong unintended side effects, whereas all natural herbs usually are more efficient, less severe on the body, and possess fewer uncomfortable side effects, if any. Many supplements for the brain that are herb based have no unwanted side effects at all.
Ginko Biloba is among the standard herbs used to improve brain function. Ginko has been used in Europe for a long time. The brain requires 20% of the total oxygen intake of the body, and Ginko appears to improve overall circulation of the blood. There are some studies that have not proven any connection, however. So, the jury is out, as they say, with regards to Ginko.
Most of the herbs that are getting used are antioxidants. Antioxidants assist the body fight oxidation from free radicals, and also help fight inflammation. Inflammation is viewed as a primary motivator behind a number of illnesses, Alzheimer’s, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and also many types of cancers. Antioxidants improve the body’s defence mechanism and tend to reduce aging.
Rosemary is among the best antioxidants around. Among the best diets you can eat is called the Mediterranean diet. Rosemary is frequently an ingredient in Mediterranean cooking. Ginseng is one other antioxidant, which is just as valuable as rosemary. Ginseng has been utilized in Asia for years to combat aging and also to boost energy and memory. Both rosemary and ginseng seem to help depression.
Another group of very important supplements for body and mind are the omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3’s are not created by the human body. You have to get them through your food consumption. This is becoming more and more difficult, because of industrialized farming techniques. One of the better ways to get omega-3’s is to take a fish oil supplement, or other oil supplement which is elevated in omega-3’s.Forex Signals Providers - ForexMinute

It's playwright James McLure's masterful ear for lively and lifelike dialogue like this that makes his one-act "Laundry and Bourbon" such an enjoyable plunge into small-town quirkiness. And a particularly effective staging by Santa Barbara's Theatre Pacifica proves the next best thing to a ride to Maynard in a hot dusty pickup truck.
Laundry and bourbon figure prominently in the back-porch banter between Hattie and Elizabeth in this all-woman show, reminiscent of the breezy intimacy of "Crimes of the Heart" and "Steel Magnolias," but without their sentimental excesses.
While Elizabeth (ClaireMarie Ghelardi) fusses with her laundry, Hattie (Tiffany Story), divides her attention between establishing a proper level of inebriation and imparting the latest local gossip.The New Jersey Community Development Corporation (NJCDC) has received a $20,000 grant from Buffalo-based M&T Bank to create programs focused on education, youth development, and housing.
Funds will go towards the nonprofit’s Great Falls Neighborhood Revitalization efforts, according to the bank which announced a total of $700,000 in grant funding to 24 community organizations throughout New Jersey.
“As a community-focused bank, M&T is dedicated to supporting local residents and providing grants for neighborhood development,” Tom Comiskey, regional president for M&T Bank, said.
NJCDC has been undertaking a number of projects to revitalize the area around the Great Falls. It has purchased a vacant American Legion Hall to convert it into a youth center for education and training.
The nonprofit has been responsible for the rehabilitation of the former storage building of the Rogers Locomotive Works. It also prevented the closure of Michael’s Energy Factory. And recently, revitalized the corner of Grand and Spruce streets with a new mixed-use housing and retail complex.

The physicist and bestselling author on the radical politics and drugs of his youth, his life’s work and why we all need a break
Carlo Rovelli is professor of physics at Aix-Marseille University. He is a pioneer in research into quantum gravity which seeks to integrate Einstein’s general theory of relativity with quantum mechanics, specifically by removing the idea of time. Rovelli’s slim book Seven Brief Lessons on Physics became an international bestseller last year, outselling Fifty Shades of Grey in his native Italy. His new book, Reality Is Not What It Seems, describes the development of physics from classical Greece to the present day. This interview was conducted on the phone with Rovelli at his home in Marseille.
Were you surprised by the great success of your book, of the appetite for theoretical physics?
I did not expect it at all. It is translated in 41 languages. I expected just a few thousand copies sold. I think it is because the book offers a perspective on science that also talks about beauty and emotions – I don’t think those things should ever be separated from science.
You began with a tale of Einstein, before he proposed his theories, loafing around, drifting. Do you think that state of mind is useful for scientists?
I think the great leaps of knowledge are made when one steps back, and forgets, and explores different things. Darwin got on a boat and went round the world and that freed his mind from the thinking in Oxford and Cambridge at the time. If he hadn’t gone on his voyage perhaps he wouldn’t have had the liberty for his discovery.
Do you try to incorporate that freedom in your own life?
I have certainly wandered around a lot. I graduated very late. I was a bad student. I travelled. I did a lot of politics in the 70s. I still try to keep my perspective as open as possible.
I read that back then you experimented with hallucinogenic drugs. Has that helped your thinking on the nature of reality?
I think we are all trapped in our habits of perception in some ways. It is not that you take drugs and you solve physics problems. Not at all! But it maybe helps in losing the idea that what we see is reality.
You have long been trying to prove the idea of quantum gravity. Do you wake up with that goal in mind?
If we could get empirical confirmation it would be fantastic. Nothing is very solid yet, but I am working on some astrophysical signals and trying to connect them with the theory. So I do wake up excited about that. I am 60. Having that kidlike excitement every day is a great privilege.
How long have you lived with that ambition?
I was around 26 when I discovered the idea of quantum gravity. The scale is very small: 10-33 centimetres. One day when I was doing my PhD I took a piece of paper and wrote 10-33 centimetres in red, very large and stuck it on the wall. And that was going to be my aim, to try to work out what was happening at that scale.
The poster must have been a tricky thing to explain to your friends and girlfriends at the time?
Yes and no. My friends saw my passion and I loved trying to explain it.
At the same time you were interested in radical politics in Italy. Were the two things connected in your mind?
I moved from one to the other. I was taken by trying to change the world through politics in the 70s. But in Italy there was a transition from great hope to disappointment in that period. It was at that point I thought there is another place where revolutions happen, and that is in science.
I guess in some ways the complexities of Italian politics made theoretical physics a walk in the park?
Yes, absolutely. Or at least it was a good way into thinking about the nature of reality.
You started a radio station back then?
I was a student in Bologna and we started this pirate station, Radio Alice, like Alice in Wonderland. It was in the centre of town and anyone could come in and talk about what was on their mind. It was fantastic for a while.
It sounds a good model for research?
Yes, science is always a matter of exchange of ideas. It has never been about national borders or whatever. Most of my work is talking and listening to people.
Some of your own collaboration has been with your partner [and former student] Francesca Vidotto. It sounds like a proper meeting of minds?
I have written a book with Francesca but she lives in the Netherlands. All relationships are different but I think ours works very well. She has very different skills from mine, but there are also new things happening, always new things to talk about.
I’m sure you need a degree of optimism to keep looking for answers to complex questions. Are you ever undone by doubt?
My normal day is to do pages of calculations and then throw them away. Part of what I do is accepting that I might have spent my whole life trying to prove a theory that is wrong. I hope it’s right. But you always have to accept the opposite is possible. If you want certainty, science is a bad place to look. But if you want reliability and probability, science is the best place to go.
Do you have a sense of mortality?
I have always had it. I believe our life is just a few numbered years. I am very serene with that. If I died today or tomorrow I would feel I have done what I can. If I have more years and can do more, then great. The more we accept what we are – mortal – the better we can live.
Did you ever have a religious faith?
When I was about 20 I thought a lot about it. And I decided I was not interested in it except as a natural phenomenon. As a philosophy I have been attracted by Buddhism. I think it comes naturally to a scientist in that it talks about impermanence and nothing being solid. I have done some meditation, but I am too busy really.
How do you relax?
I love living by the sea. I have an old sailing boat, 100 years old, very beautiful. If I am stressed I take it out, concentrate on sailing and not falling in the water, and by the time I come back everything is always back in place in my head.

Iraqi soldiers inspect the site of a Baghdad blast that injured the Polish ambassador Wednesday. security firm that protects U.S. diplomats, a source told CNN.
The deputy chief of the Polish mission said Pietrzyk was released Wednesday afternoon from a U.S. military hospital and was to be taken first to Ramstein Air Base in Germany and then to Poland for further treatment. Officials said the diplomat had a leg wound and suffered burns in the attack.
Watch video from the scene of the attack »
The deputy said the U.S. military was handling the investigation. He said he was initially told two or three car bombs were involved. "The terrorists opened fire after the bombing and our guys returned fire," he said.
"We expect the government of Iraq to find those responsible for this deliberate attack and punish them."
Iraqi officials said the strike targeted the convoy, but it was unclear if it was an assassination attempt on Pietrzyk.
But the deputy chief of mission was unequivocal, saying, "In my view it was a deliberate attack to kill."
The blasts were powerful: News footage showed the charred SUVs, a helicopter landing on a rubble-strewn street, heavily equipped soldiers escorting a bandaged man into the craft and a chopper flying away.
After the blast, U.S. troops swiftly moved into the area and sealed it. The Americans assisted with evacuation and medical support, said Mirembe Nantongo, a U.S. Embassy spokeswoman in Iraq.
Ryan C. Crocker, U.S. ambassador to Iraq, and Gen. David H. Petraeus, the top U.S. commander in the country, condemned the attack.
"Poland has been a strong and steadfast ally here and around the world, and we commend its commitment to a stable and secure Iraq," they said in a joint statement.
Poland has had a strong presence in the U.S.-led coalition, and its military commands the Multi-National Division-Central South region.
Warsaw has a contingent of about 900 troops in the country, according to the Brookings Institution's Iraq Index. Twenty-one Polish troops have died in the Iraq war. In 2004, insurgents attacked the Polish Embassy in Baghdad, but no one was injured.
Also Wednesday, Adm. Michael Mullen landed in Baghdad after taking office this week as chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, Pentagon officials said.
Mullen will spend a week in Iraq and Afghanistan, officials said. Aides said the trip is aimed at giving Mullen an immediate assessment of the situation in both conflicts.
In a message to U.S. troops after taking office Monday, he said, ."
Later on Wednesday at least three civilians were killed and seven others were wounded when mortars slammed into two residential neighborhoods in central Samarra, north of Baghdad, police said.
The mortars appear to have been targeting a nearby Iraqi army base, police said.
In a separate incident, in the town of Ishaqi, 50 miles (80 kilometers) north of the capital, an Iraqi police officer was killed at noon Wednesday by unidentified gunmen as he was leaving the police station.
Also, a car bomb explosion in an eastern Baghdad commercial district killed at least one Iraqi civilian and wounded four others Wednesday, an Interior Ministry official said.
Meanwhile, a U.S. military commander in Iraq maintained Wednesday that a man arrested last month by American forces in the Iraqi Kurdish region is a key operative from the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' Quds Force.
Maj. Gen Kevin Bergner dismissed Iranian claims the man is a businessman.
Bergner said Mahmoud Farhady, arrested September 20 in Sulaimaniya, has been in charge of the Zafar Command, one of three units of the Ramazan Corps of the Quds Force.
The U.S. military has accused Quds Force agents of training and equipping Iraqi insurgents, an allegation Iran repeatedly has denied.
In Washington, Iraq's national security adviser met with top Bush administration officials on Tuesday and Wednesday, according to one of his aides.
Mowaffak al-Rubaie conferred with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice on Tuesday and was to meet with Vice President Dick Cheney on Wednesday, the aide said.
Al-Rubaie and Rice discussed the training of Iraqi security forces, the role of private security companies and the Iraqi neighbors conference to be held in November. E-mail to a friend

The Book of Ceremonies by Gabriel Horn brings together mystery, gratitude, rituals, and living from the heart, all parts of Native American spirituality. The author sees reverence as an essential virtue in the repertoire of all those who are living the sacred.
Honoring the Medicine by Kenneth Cohen is a richly informative volume emphasizing an integral approach to Native American healing that blends philosophy, science, principles, and practice. He concludes that their system of healing is as varied and abundant as acupuncture, homeopathy, and Ayurveda.
Keep Going by James M. Marshall III is destined to become a staple in Native American literature about the art of perseverance. It proves that treasures are often hidden in tragedies and that nature is a wise teacher about loss and impermanence.
Medicine Cards by Jamie Sams and David Carson is a popular book and card set based on the symbolism of 44 animals and lessons to be learned from them. The Medicine Cards and companion volume help us to get back in touch with the spiritual wisdom that is revealed by nature and storytelling.
Nature's Way by Ed McGaa (Eagle Man) is filled with insights into Native American companionship with animals, the importance of truth telling, the connections with the Spirit world, and the value of laughter. This salutary book shows how cherishing the Earth can become a way of life.
Neither Wolf nor Dog by Kent Nerburn shares an extraordinary account of his encounters with Dan, a Lakota elder who unflinchingly speaks the truth about Indian life, past and present. Filled with incisive observations, here is a classic that should be read and savored by anyone interested in Native American spirituality. A film adaptation has been made for release in 2016.
No Word for Time by Evan T. Pritchard presents a lyrical and spiritually deep summation of the myths, history, and philosophy of the Algonquin people. Pritchard shares his experiences of fasting, his first sweat lodge, a vision quest, and receiving his spiritual name.
Profiles in Wisdom by Steve McFadden draws together interviews with 17 elders who suggest ways of coming to terms with environmental degradation and cultural confusion. The result is discerning counsel for all those who want to tread lightly on the Earth.
A Seat at the Table by Huston Smith and Phil Cousineau shares nine interviews with leaders including Vine Deloria Jr., Oren Lyons, and Charlotte Black Elk. They discuss the hardships they have experienced and the legacy that Native Americans want to pass on to the next generations.
Walking on the Wind by Michael Garrett contends that for the Cherokee tribe, walking the path of good medicine means being in sync with the universe and all its rhythms. He explains their "Rule of Acceptance," which involves letting things unfold in their own time.
The Woman Who Watches Over the World by Linda Hogan is a brilliantly executed autobiography about her Chicksaw relatives, dreams, the good Earth, animals, a near fatal accident, Crazy Horse's connection with stones, and much more. Her sensitivities reveal a deeply spiritual person who has been able to take on the challenges of love and suffering.Garage Remodeling Contractors Kalispell MT

Garage Remodeling
Provided By:
Garage Remodeling the house, and you can see how quickly the garage can become an unhealthy, disorganized, inefficient space.
Enter garage enhancement - an increasingly popular makeover trend that offers homeowners a wealth of health, energy-saving and usability benefits.
Enhancements can include improving ventilation; insulating doors; adding, upgrading or controlling lighting for energy efficiency; coating or covering the floor; and storing "stuff€
around the perimeter in a safe and organized way, all of which can contribute to a better, safer garage.
So where to start? Here are four areas you can address when giving your garage a makeover this summer.
1. Air Quality
To keep the air in the garage healthy, install an exhaust fan on an outside wall positioned to vent away from the interior of the house. The fan should run for several minutes every time a car enters or leaves the garage. For simple operation, you can install a timer that controls the fan's operation, and wire the timer so it's triggered by the opening of the garage door or by a motion detector.
To reduce any infiltration of fumes from the garage to the interior of your home and minimize the loss of conditioned air from the room adjacent to the garage, add weather stripping around the door between the garage and the home. It's also a good idea to install a carbon monoxide detector in any room above an attached garage to monitor air quality.
To keep wind-driven rain, leaves, dirt, dust, pollen and most small rodents out of your garage, you can install seals on the floor directly under the garage doors. The seals, which apply easily with adhesive, can fill the gap between the floor and the door's existing weather stripping. Garage door seals are widely available in kits.
2. Energy Efficiency
For energy efficiency, light your garage with Energy Star compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs), which use at least 65 percent less energy than standard incandescent bulbs while producing the same amount of light. For example, a 15-watt CFL yields as much light as a 60-watt incandescent, and a 25-watt CFL provides light comparable to a 100-watt incandescent.
Lighting controls such as programmable timers and occupancy sensors that install in a single gang wall box in place of a standard light switch can improve energy efficiency, provide convenience and enhance safety. These devices can reduce lighting usage in a residential garage by as much as 30 to 40 percent.
For example, Decora electronic timers from Leviton Mfg. Company, based in Little Neck, N.Y., will automatically shut off lights after a pre-programmed period of time, in anywhere from 2 minutes to 12 hours. All models also have a simple on/off button.
Another energy-efficient lighting option for a garage is an occupancy sensor, which will turn lights on when the garage is occupied and off when it is vacant. Some sensors combine occupancy or vacancy sensing with nightlights for added convenience and safety.
Leviton's new Decora Nightlight Sensor, for instance, is available in occupancy sensing and vacancy sensing models. The devices use passive infrared technology to detect the heat naturally emitted by humans, and incorporate a user-dimmable LED nightlight, which automatically illuminates a room or area based on the ambient light.
The occupancy-sensing unit will automatically switch lights on once occupancy is detected within its field of view, and will switch lights off again when the room is vacant. The vacancy-sensing unit, once manually switched on, will monitor the garage for occupancy and automatically switch lighting off after a user-specified interval once it no longer detects occupancy. The models feature a 180-degree field of view with approximately 1,200 feet of coverage.
For workshop areas, 4-foot fluorescent fixtures with reflective backing and electronic ballasts are more energy efficient than incandescent options. Electronic ballasts are particularly important for homes in northern regions, since these ballasts will start in cold temperatures.
3. Flooring
Unfinished concrete can crack and is not easy to clean. Coating or covering a concrete floor in a garage can improve slip and chemical resistance, and seal or protect the surface from moisture and dust.
Applying paints or epoxies to a concrete floor typically requires shot blasting, acid washing or other surface preparation to ensure complete and durable bonding, but this may expose occupants to odors until the application dries or cures. Using a water-based epoxy will reduce odors, and using a solvent-free, high-solids epoxy will eliminate strong fumes. While most epoxy coatings generally last a year to a few years, there are formulations that offer longer protection.
For example, PremierOne Floor Coating Systems, from Phoenix, Ariz.-based PremierGarage, feature a hybrid polymer chemical formulation that is stain-resistant, non-flammable and non-hazardous to people, pets and the environment. Free of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and solvents, the PremierOne Floor Coating System can be installed in a day, and the garage is usually available for use 24 hours after application.
The coating, which is available in 16 combinations of colors and finish textures such as terrazzo or granite, applies onto a concrete floor that has been degreased, so there are no oil and grease stains, and repaired, so there are no open cracks or large surface imperfections. In addition, for proper adhesion, the surface has to be professionally prepared via mechanical grinding or acid etching. The coating has a life expectancy of 10 years or more under normal care and use.
If you want to cover your garage floor without having to prepare the concrete beyond sweeping, you can select wall to wall or under-vehicle mats or tiles that provide needed traction, are easier to clean than untreated concrete and help prevent the underlying concrete from deteriorating.
Durable options include wide-sheet polyvinyl rollout floor coverings and interlocking polypropylene tiles, both available in a choice of colors. Polymer slip-resistant flooring that looks like granite and terrazzo is also available.
These materials, which are free of fumes, install in a few hours and protect floors from dirt, gasoline, oils, battery acid, antifreeze, salt and other chemicals. Unlike epoxy and paint finishes, which can peel over time and require re-application, these floor coverings last a long time and can be swept clean or washed with soap and water, either in place or, if mats, hosed down right outside the garage.
Modular flooring is another option for the garage. Though it has been popular for decades in commercial properties and has been used as athletic surfacing for many years, modular garage flooring is a relatively new concept for the home. It's often available with characteristics that increase durability and performance.
For example, RaceDeck Garage Interlocking Modular Flooring, from Snap Lock Industries of Salt Lake City, was designed specifically to bear the weight of a vehicle. Made from polypropylene, the waterproof tiles feature short nibs on the undersides to keep the tiles off the concrete, enabling the floor to breathe. The module tiles install over a clean, swept floor and do not require patching of cracks beforehand. Installation is odorless and without fumes.
The tiles are available in solid or perforated 12-inch or 18-inch squares in several patterns in 12 colors. The tiles snap together with fairly tight seams to create geometric or freeform patterns, and can be cut with a table saw or circular saw. The tiles, which are UV stable, are not affected by moisture and can be damp-mopped.
While most spills will stay put on the top of the floor, if the spill is directly over a seam and seeps through, any affected tiles will come apart easily for cleaning or replacement and then snap back into place. Perforated tiles are available for use around floor drains.
G-Floor roll-out garage and concrete floor covers, from Lenexa, Kan.-based Better Life Technology, is 100-percent solid polyvinyl flooring designed specifically for use in garages. It comes in widths up to 10 feet, in three thicknesses, and is available in four patterns, including smooth, diamond tread for slip resistance, coin for easy cleaning and appearance, and rib-channeled for draining liquid and debris out of the garage.
Suitable for wall-to-wall installations, the rolls trim with a utility knife. The flooring lies directly on concrete or on a wood subfloor, sealing it off so spills can't get underneath. The waterproof material grips the floor and stays in place without glue, does not outgas, meets all flame ratings, and won't mold or rot. Though not stain-proof, it wipes clean using water, soap or standard vinyl cleaners.
Adjacent runs can be overlapped, butted or seamed with an optional seaming strip. Overlapping allows easy removal of any section for hosing off outside the garage.
4. Organization
€. Keep pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, transmission and brake fluid, motor oil, antifreeze and other automotive and lawn chemicals in their original (clearly labeled) containers off the floor (where they can spill and get wet) and on secure shelves or in secure cabinets out of reach of children.
€. Avoid leaning shovels, rakes and sharp-edged tools that can fall over against the wall. Hang them on secure hooks along the walls, out of harm's way and in a place with a clear path to access.
€. Wipe up any grease, oil or other chemical spills as quickly as possible.
€. Keep a multi-purpose fire extinguisher visible and accessible in the garage, and acquaint all family members with its location.
€. Get rid of any leftover toxic chemicals. Don't save them "just in case.€
Take them to a hazardous household waste disposal or collection site.
€. Finally, never run a car in a closed garage. If the garage is under rooms in the home, drive in front-forward to minimize the carbon monoxide fumes inside the garage.
By taking these steps, you can ensure that your garage is as safe, healthy and organized as the rest of your home.

Movie Reviews: THE LAST KING OF SCOTLAND & MARIE ANTOINETTE
In theaters
THE LAST KING OF SCOTLAND
In the 1970s, a Scottish doctor becomes the personal physician of Ugandan dictator Idi Amin (Whitaker). Once he realizes Amin's insanity and viciousness, he's appalled that he's abetting the tyrant.
Cast Gillian Anderson, Forest Whitaker, James McAvoy, David Oyelowo, Kerry Washington, Simon McBurney (more)
Director(s) Kevin MacDonald
Writer(s) Peter Morgan, Jeremy Brock
Status In theaters (limited)
Genre(s) Drama
Release Date Sept. 27, 2006
MPAA Rating R - for some strong violence and gruesome images, sexual content and language.
Review:
The Last King of Scotland is an interesting character study and shows that sometimes the scariest villains are the one that seem harmless. Here is where Forest Whitaker, perennial movie nice guy, fits in perfectly. Whitaker always brings a sense of sereneness to his roles. In this film Whitaker adds a sense of unpredictability and danger to his usual machinations. Whitaker conveys such an excellent sense of charm and madness that you never really know what his character will do. Needless to say Whitaker is well deserving of his Oscar nod but sadly he's the best facet of this heavy handed movie. Kevin MacDonald directs this film sloppily and has a tendency to beat the audience over the head with important or dramatic moments. It's far from a horrible effort but with the top tier performances from Whitaker and McAvoy, to a lesser extent, a more subdued directorial hand may have served the film better. This film is worth watching simply to see Whitaker dish out a career defining performance.

MARIE ANTOINETTE
When betrothed to King Louis XVI (Jason Schwartzman), the Austrian-born Marie Antoinette (Kirsten Dunst) enters the French court, rebels against Versailles and becomes France's most misunderstood monarch. Stripped of her riches, imprisoned and beheaded by her own subjects, the queen of France becomes a symbol of excess.
Cast Kirsten Dunst, Jason Schwartzman, Rip Torn, Judy Davis, Asia Argento, Marianne Faithfull (more)
Director(s) Sofia Coppola
Writer(s) Sofia Coppola
Status On DVD
Genre(s) Drama
Release Date Oct. 20, 2006
DVD Release Date Feb. 13, 2007
MPAA Rating PG-13 - for sexual content, partial nudity and innuendo.
Review:
Sofia Coppola's Marie Antoinette is an opulent exercise in stagnation. If you are looking for a sweeping historical epic then you will be sorely disappointed with this film. Instead, Coppola chooses to focus on the title character's sense of confinement. This is a film that has an almost dream like lack of forward momentum. Coppola does inject the film with some style by infusing some modern music into certain of the films sequences. Once Marie arrives a Versailles Coppola plays it more as if she's been sentenced to a gaudy prison sentence. Kirsten Dunst is decent as the titular character giving her a decent amount of naiveté and confusion. Jason Schwartzman is given painfully little to do here other than look perplexed and uninterested. Still, while this movie might not be for everyone, Sophia Coppola does deliver an interesting film, so much so that when the movie reaches its historical climax you feel a true sense of pain and empathy for the title character.

Mr Trump should "think long and hard before they are endangering the status of who, for all practical purposes, are American kids," Mr Obama said Monday at a White House news conference.
"These are kids who were brought here by their parents. They did nothing wrong. They've gone to school, they've pledged allegiance to the flag. By definition, if they're part of this programme, they are solid, wonderful young people with good character."
Mr Trump campaigned on a promise to deport the more than 11 million people in the country illegally, floating the idea of creating a deportation force in addition to his signature promise to build a wall along the southern border.
Fear has spiked among those who came to the US illegally as children and registered for Mr Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, a programme launched in 2012 to provide temporary protection from deportation.
Those who joined the programme are now concerned the personal information they gave the US Citizenship and Immigration Services could be used by the Trump administration to track them down and deport them to the countries of their birth.
To qualify for the programme, applicants were required to submit information not only about themselves, but parents and relatives who may also be undocumented. Around 728,000 immigrants are currently enrolled.
"It is my strong belief the majority of the American people would not want to suddenly see those kids having to start hiding again," Mr Obama said.
"That is something I will encourage the president-elect to look at."
'Getting Them Out'
Mr Trump said in an interview with "60 Minutes" broadcast Sunday that he would initially focus on deporting people with criminal records or gang affiliations. The Obama administration has focused its considerable deportation efforts on the same kinds of people.
"We are getting them out of our country or we are going to incarcerate them," he said.
Mr Trump said that after deporting criminals and gang members and completing construction of a border wall, he would "make a determination" about others in the country illegally. He said many of the remainder were "terrific people" but did not elaborate further on how he would approach the issue of their undocumented status.
It's also not clear whether Mr Trump will order the Department of Homeland Security to suspend the Daca programme and halt issuance of work permits to Dreamers, as children brought to the country illegally are called by their advocates.

Extra Credit for The Poisonwood Bible
No stranger to controversy: As you can probably guess from reading Poisonwood, Barbara Kingsolver is no stranger to political controversy. During the early 1990s, she left the country to protest the Bush administration’s decision to wage war in the Persian Gulf. A decade later, she was in the news again for criticizing Bush the Younger’s “War on Terror.”
Awards!: Kingsolver has won or been nominated for many prestigious honors over the years. She was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize for Poisonwood, and won the Los Angeles Time Book Award. Possibly her greatest honor, though, is Poisonwood being chosen for Oprah’s Book Club.2018 New Land Rover Lr2 Review and News
That has been established by test mule spied recently, land rover is currently along the way of updating the product Selection Rover Sport. It is scheduled to reach in the 2nd 2017. Regardless of the existing product around for only 2 yrs now upgrade the 2018 new land rover lr2, the British automaker has already determined to give it a mid-cycle Beauty. It absolutely was for the first time the current Range Rover Activity SUV in March 2013, and acquired a number of computer and improvements since then.
In the spy photographs, we see slight improvements to the surface detail of the 2018 new land rover lr2. Probably the most clear is somewhat increased opportunities which describes the stronger engine underneath the cover consumption. Leading grille gets numerous record baby Buy – move from the existing three-bar, Discovery sport-type design. Beneath the buffer, there is also an amendment to the leading bumper. At the trunk, you will find no clear changes. If you want a more individualized Selection Rover Game, you can find a number of distinct gear packages.
There’s a new carbon fibre deal, which features a particular rear-view mirrors, changed grille, renovated rear end. Apart from the central and additional improvements of the 2018 new land rover lr2, and expect the SUV to obtain a bevy of sophisticated technology. A new feature worthy of notice could be the protection of InControl system that enables you to inform the disaster companies straight away in the event of an accident. Still another advantage is the advanced process after InControl which give a bevy of services. Some sophisticated functions include top and vehicle entry system, all-terrain development, and begin / stop system.
Hi All,
The following patch set provides a new communication path "IVRing" for
collecting kernel log or tracing data of guests by a host without using
network
in a virtualization environment. Network is generally used to collect log
or
tracing data after outputting the data as a file. However, since I/O
resources
such as network or block are shared with other guests, these resources
should
not be used for logging or tracing. Moreover, high load will be taken to
applications on guests using network I/O because there are many network
stack
layers. Then, a communication method for collecting the data without using
I/O resources is needed.
There are two requirements to collect kernel log or tracing data by a host:
(1) To minimize for user applications in a guest
- not using I/O resources
(2) To be implemented recording buffer like ring
- keep on recording log data or trace data
To meet these requirements, a ring-buffer as a device driver for guest OSs,
called IVRing, is constructed on Inter-VM shared memory (IVShmem) device.
IVShmem implemented in QEMU is a virtual PCI RAM device and uses POSIX
shared
memory on a host. This device is originally used as a virtual device for
low-overhead communication between two guests. On the other hand, here,
IVShmem
is used as a communication path between a guest and a host for collecting
data.
IVRing is a buffer of logging or tracing data in a guest, and
IVRing-reader,
opening shared memory as IVRing on a host, reads the data without memory
copying
between a guest and a host. Thus, two requirements are met for collecting
kernel
log or tracing data.
We will talk about IVRing in LinuxCon Japan 2012:
Title: Low-Overhead Ring-Buffer of Kernel Tracing &
Tracing Across Host OS and Guest OS
Speakers: Yoshihiro Yunomae and Akihiro Nagai
You can download our slides about IVRing in the schedule page.
***Evaluation***
When a host collects tracing data of a guest, the performance of using
IVRing
is compared with that of using network.
The overview of this evaluation is as follows:
(a) A guest on a KVM is prepared.
- The guest is dedicated one physical CPU as a virtual CPU(VCPU).
(b) The guest starts to write tracing data to a SystemTap buffer.
- The probe points of SystemTap are all trace points of sched, timer,
and kmem.
(c) The tracing data are recorded to IVRing sharing memory with a host or
the tracing data are sent to a host via network.
- 3 patterns, IVRing, NFS, and SSH, are measured.
Each methods is explained about later.
/BARE_SCORE) * 100.
The performance of each method is compared as follows:
[1] IVRing
- A SystemTap script in a guest records trace data to IVRing.
- A IVRing-reader on a host reads the data.
[2] NFS
- A directory in a guest is shared with that in a host via NFS.
- A SystemTap script in a guest records trace data to a file
in the directory.
[3] SSH
- A SystemTap script in a guest output trace data to a host using
standard output via SSH.
Other information is as follows:
- host
kernel: 3.3.1-5 (Fedora16)
CPU: Intel Xeon [email protected](6core)
Memory: 50GB
- guest(only booting one guest)
kernel: 3.4.0+ (Fedora16)
CPU: 1VCPU(dedicated)
Memory: 2GB
3 patterns based on the bare environment were indicated as follows:
Scores overhead against [0] Bare
[0] Bare 29043600 -
[1] IVRing 28565398 1.6[%]
[2] NFS 22000508 24.3[%]
[3] SSH 10246792 64.7[%]
The overhead of IVRing is much lower than other methods using network. This
is
because the IVRing method only records trace data to a ring-buffer. On the
other hand, other methods read trace data from a SystemTap buffer to the
userland and send the data to a host via network. Therefore, a method of
using
IVRing minimizes the overhead of transporting trace data from a guest to a
host.
***How to use***
Here, how to use IVRing and IVRing-reader is simply given.
1. Prepare any distribution including qemu-kvm binary after 0.13.0 version.
IVShmem was pushed on qemu-kvm mainline after 0.13.0 version.
Latest Fedora or Ubuntsu are available.
2. Boot a guest installed IVRing driver with device option.
A device option is needed as follows:
-device ivshmem,size=,shm=
shm_obj, shared memory object path, is used later to share the memory
region
with the reader on a host. For example, a device option is like below:
-device ivshmem,size=2,shm=/ivshmem
IVShmem supports interrupts mode using ivshmem_server and this IVRing
driver is
implemented as usable for doorbelling to the reader as a experimental
feature.
This feature will be used near the future.
3. Run IVRing-reader on a host.
To share the memory region with IVShmem, s option for indicating shm_obj
which
is same as the second step is needed like below:
./ivring_reader -m 2 -f /tmp/log.txt -S 10 -N 2 -s /ivshmem
Each options are indicated 2nd patch in detail.
Then, IVRing-reader starts to read data from IVRing, but the ring-buffer is
empty yet.
shared object size: 2097152 (bytes)
Ring header is already initialized
reader -1, writer 0, pos 20074a9f
ivring_init_hdr: 0x7f128417d000
Receive an interrupt 2
Try to read buffer.
Receive an interrupt 2
no data
__ivring_read ret=0
Try to read buffer.
no data
__ivring_read ret=0
Try to read buffer.
...
4. Start to record logging or tracing data on a guest.
API for kernel programing is available for IVRing driver:
ivring_write(int ID, void *buf, size_t size).
It is used for kernel logging as follows:
int len;
char buf[1024];
len = sprintf(buf, "hogehoge\n",... )
ivring_write(0, buf, len);
When SystemTap is used as a tracer, a sample script is as follows:
%{
extern int ivring_write(int id, void *buf, size_t size);
%}
function ivring_print(str:string) %{
ivring_write(0, THIS->str, strlen(THIS->str));
%}
probe kernel.trace("sched*") {
ivring_print(sprintf("%u: %s(%s)\n", gettimeofday(), pn(), $$parms))
}
The script is executed as
stap -vg ivring_writer_sample.stp.
When it is success to record data to IVRing, reader outputs as follows:
Try to read buffer.
__ivring_read ret=4096
__ivring_read ret=4096
__ivring_read ret=313
Try to read buffer.
__ivring_read ret=4096
__ivring_read ret=4096
__ivring_read ret=632
Try to read buffer.
***Future Work***
Features below will be implemented as future work:
1. To implement a feature of notification from a guest to a host
2. To implement user I/F on a guest
3. To be usable in tracing system existing in-kernel
4. To be usable in SMP environment
(lockless ring-buffer like ftrace, one ring-buffer one CPU)
5. To design for Live Migration
Thank you,

We will have no hesitation recommending your business to others."ASIC has announced the results from its review of the 31 December 2014 financial reports of 100 listed and other public interest entities. ASIC said that it has made enquiries of 23 entities on 36 matters seeking explanations of accounting treatments. ASIC Commissioner John Price said the largest number of the findings relate to impairment of non-financial assets and inappropriate accounting treatments.
ASIC said that its risk-based surveillance of the financial reports of public interest entities for reporting periods ended 30 June 2010 to 30 June 2014 has led to material changes to 4% of the financial reports of public interest entities reviewed by ASIC. The main changes related to impairment of assets, revenue recognition and expense deferral. ASIC said that it continues to identify concerns regarding assessments of the recoverability of the carrying values of assets, including goodwill, other intangibles, exploration and evaluation expenditure, and property, plant and equipment. The largest number of ASIC’s enquiries at 30 June 2014 related to assets in the mining and renewable energy industries. More broadly, the 36 enquiries made by ASIC related to the following matters:
- impairment and other asset values (10 enquiries);
- off-balance sheet arrangements and business combinations (8);
- revenue recognition (5);
- tax accounting (5);
- non-IFRS financial information (4);
- treatment of expenses (3);
- other (1).
Note that ASIC has recently issued Information Sheet 203 Impairment of non-financial assets: Materials for directors (INFO 203) to assist directors and audit committees in considering whether the value of non-financial assets shown in a company’s financial report continues to be supportable.Another review from triple j magazine, this time the lead review on TVOTR's fourth LP
TV On The Radio - Nine Types of Light (Interscope)
TV On The Radio - Nine Types of Light (Interscope)
Has it really been three years since the all-conquering urgency of DearScience? Its contents championed by the blogosphere, beloved by purveyors of intelligent music and in turn built substantial anticipation for its follow-up. During that down-time, side-projects emerged to sate the faithful that – although serviceable – couldn’t hide what they were: fragmented parts of a greater whole. In particular, multi-intstrumentalist/production linchpin Dave Sitek’s Maximum Balloon, which sounded like TVOTR only with a turnstile of guest vocalists.
It’s with relief and open arms then, that after Tunde Adebimpe’s leisurely half-spoken opening on Second Song, that the Brooklynites instinctively click into a spirited pulse encouraged by Kyp Malone’s wiry guitars and some dishy horns.
Keep Your Heart and You follow, each a deft blend of touching romantic sentiment and partisan groove. Lines like “you’re the only one I ever loved” might suggest the band have gone soft, cozying up to the tenderness always inherent in their skilful drama but underplayed. But then along comes the electric command on No Future Shock to rush the apocalyptic dance floor “do the no future/shock, don’t stop.”
While these horn-abetted art-funk jams are immense fun, it’s the kind of thing the group could knock out in their sleep. More impressive is the album centrepiece Killer Crane. Using orchestral washes, the lightest of metronomic guitars (is that banjo?) to form a slow-building grace. Meanwhile, the record’s back-end contains searing highlights, among them the grimy New CannonballBlues, the bubbling attack of Repetition, and finishing with the insistent stomp of Caffeinated Consciousness.
If there is criticism to be levelled at Nine Types of Light, it’s that it doesn’t stray far from the musical blueprint of its predecessor; Dear Science Pt II if you will. It matters little, TV On The Radio once again sound like leaders, innovators. Their inspirations nigh-invisible, yet their own influence: impossible to ignore.
This. album. does. not. sound. like. Dear Science. Must listen carefully.SLA Boys Program for Spring 2018
Registration opens December 1st
There are several changes to SLA's spring 2018 offerings:
First, SLA is adopting the recently developed Lacrosse Athlete Development Model (LADM) from US Lacrosse, the national governing body for the sport. The LADM emphasizes small sided instruction and games, resulting in more touches per player and greater opportunity to grow with the sport. You can read more about LADM here.
In 2018, SLA will be offering both an expanded local recreational 10U, 12U and 14U age groups in 2018, but overall registration numbers and player preference will determine the final shape of the offering at each age group. 6U and 8U will be local rec only and may be combined as required by registration numbers. See the age group eligibility (by birth date) and program summary chart below.
LOCAL RECREATION OPTION
The local recreational playing option will feature small-sided instruction and all games in Stafford and (possibly) Spotsylvania counties. Season runs March through May and will consist of two practices per week and up to 7 games on Saturdays.
6U Age Group: 3v3 (no goalies), modified field (smaller than 60x35 yds), mini or soft sticks, soft lacrosse balls, no protective equipment
8U Age Group: 3v3 or 4v4, modified field (60x35 yds), regular sticks (can be shortened), soft lacrosse balls, full protective equipment
10U Age Group: 7v7 modified field (60x35 yds), regulation sticks, regulation NOCSAE balls, full protective equipment
12U Age Group: 10v10, full field lacrosse (this may be modified to meet the development needs of registered players); regulation NOCSAE balls, regulation sticks, full protective equipment
14U Age Group: 10v10 full field lacrosse (this may be modified to meet the development needs of registered players); regulation NOCSAE balls, regulation sticks, full protective equipment
All first year players must play in the local rec option. Second year players should play in the local rec option, but can play in the NVYLL league with a coach's recommendation and a successful pre-season assessment to one of those teams.
NVYLL OPTION
The Northern Virginia Youth Lacrosse League  per week, an 8-game regular season and a playoff experience. The season runs from mid-February (assessments) through early June (playoffs).
In 2018, participation on an NVYLL level team will require the player to 'opt-in' to NVYLL during the registration process by selecting the, "Interested in NVYLL" option. The NVYLL playing option is only available at the 10U, 12U and 14U age groups. All NVYLL age groups play 10v10 full field lacrosse.
UNIFORMS
Another change for 2018 is that members will order their uniforms directly from the manufacturer following during the registration process. Upon successful completion of the registration, the link to our online store with the uniform supplier, Powell Lacrosse, will be contained in the confirmation email sent to the address used during the registration process.
The 2018 uniforms are identical to the 2017 uniforms. If you are a returning player whose 2017 uniform still fits, no purchase is required. New players and those requiring new sizes should purchase the required items. - 24 March (NVYLL); 7 April (Local Rec)
In-season Practices:
Practices are conducted at parks and schools throughout the county...2018 locations TBD;
NVYLL teams practice up to three times per week, local rec teams will practice up to two times per week.

Chapter 14 continues the long contrast between wisdom and folly. In verse 22, God asks a rhetorical question that contains the obvious and expected answer within the question itself. It goes like this, “Do not those who plot evil go astray? But those who plan what is good find love and faithfulness.” (NIV) Few of the proverbs are presented in the form of a question; most which are presented as a question, are like this one, done so for emphasis. God does not want us to miss the point. He is in effect saying, “Make no mistake about it, this is no gamble, it is a sure thing”.
The two verbs “plot” and “plan” in verse 22 are exactly the same word in the original Hebrew. We know many people who seem to simply wind up doing evil, without a plan to do it. They are simply weak or ignorant or foolish. Others we know seem to spend much time and energy plotting evil. Verse 22 indicates that those who plot evil will certainly go astray. The idea of going astray brings Isaiah 53 to mind: we have all like sheep gone astray, turning to our own way. Jesus tells us in John 14 that He is “The Way” and that it is impossible to get to heaven without coming through Him. Plotting evil will cause you to go astray and miss “The Way”. My advice is to heed the warning.
I come into regular contact with people who are plotting evil; if personal experience is not enough evidence, all I have to do is take a quick glance at the newspaper and I have more than enough examples. Please do not imagine that this is limited to the heinous crimes that we see in others. It is most certainly also our plotting to: cheat our employer out of a full day’s work; hide assets of loved one’s so that the government will pay their bills; draw unemployment checks when we could work; apply for disability when we could do some kind of work; gossip (which is often designed to hurt someone); making others appear in an unfavorable light to make ourselves look better; etc. and etc. Maybe I did not list your problem, but that’s not necessary; you can add that one to the list yourself. It would be a great benefit to our own selves if we would take a long, close look at our plots and plans. The consequences are significant whether we do or don’t.
The second half of verse 22 presents an emphatic contrast. Those who plot and plan what is good will surely find love and faithfulness. An alternate and legitimate translation could say that those who plot and plan what is good will display love and faithfulness. Mercy, kindness, and truth have also been used to describe the result of planning what is good. Just as we know people who seem to commit evil without trying, we also know those who seem to do good without really planning it, if it sneaks up on them, if the opportunity just appears before them. Have you ever stopped to consider what would happen in the world around you if you actually spent time planning and plotting good? I can barely imagine how the world would change if a majority of people tried that. We would both give and receive love, faithfulness, mercy, truth, and kindness. What a blessed and glorious)(For the uninitiated, Thane is a suburb on the outskirts of Mumbai, and about 40 kms from Mahim.)
Happiness is a strange thing. The more you try to chase it, the more elusive it seems. But I guess its real beauty lies in the fact that you can only feel it when it reaches you, not the other way around.
My watch read 11:30 as I managed to just about have a glimpse of the time in the quiet lulling night, sitting on the steps at Mahim Beach. The splendor of the city shone in its stillness for a change, as an unfinished bridge blocked the full moon, shinning down upon the waters which were doing a little dance of their own. I have always looked at Mahim Beach as the common man's beach. Sure, Marine Drive graces like a queen resting in her shade of purple, and Juhu beach is the place where a man feels alone, in the swarming sea of humanity. But the stretch of Mahim Beach upto Worli is the sea of absolute stillness, lending an ear to every man who seeks his daily solace. I can't help but overlook the young married couple, while the husband murmurs in a loud tone, enough for everybody around to hear, about his successes in life and the wife looks on with a forced awe, probably out of her necessary captivity to fate. The man with a ragged look, the grey moustache and the checked shirt is silent, looking endlessly at the moon. The middle aged man has heavy wrinkles, as he prepares for his customary 20 min sojourn, while sitting on the beach, before he catches the last local and boards home to find a house to run. The rag pickers play around with the shells, with the large shiny ones being stuffed in their enormous ragbags, probably the biggest prize they will ever own, one that they would probably sleep the cold night on the roads with and impressions of crowning glory in their dreams.
With these thoughts in my mind, I boarded a taxi to take another expedition of its own sorts, as I prepared to catch the 1 hour train taking me across the city while showcasing a million little journeys in itself.
Getting down at Matunga station is a nightmare of sorts for those who always know where the next road leads. In the midst of total darkness, I shuffle, with skepticisms to guide me initially, only to be replaced by a total elation at finding myself with nowhere to go and just walking in the tunnel. The slow , idyllic walk is stopped with a mind numbing sight. A crippled mother , of about hardly 4'5 in height with disheveled hair, was combing her daughter's hair, just about matching her as she stood. The mother looked with eyes of promise at her beautiful young child and as I passed by in absolute numbness, somewhere I could hear the mother say to her "You are going to be beautiful someday, my child". I suddenly realize that I have to rush and run, whereby I just about manage to catch the last local and to my amusement, I find the compartment empty.
It is boarded, not surprisingly, by people from all walks of life, all bound by the two things that drive the city today, circumstance and necessity. At the entrance of the carpet, is a nearly naked old man, with strands of unkempt white hair laid out bare, as he sleeps like a child never wanting to wake up. Three old men, with their namaaz caps on, look towards the sky from their windows, murmuring their prayer, presumably. Despite enough places to sit, I go across to a group of people who stand to take in the unique Mumbai winds.
The Mumbai Winds. Sharp and cool at the same time, refreshing to some, a necessity to others. I watch a man, wearing the what is now common sight of a neat white sleeved shirt with two buttons open. He is old and haggard, with a bead in his hand and he is mumbling his prayers too. That is what has driven Mumbai despite suffering from 3 bomb blasts and every evil that has been inflicted to it till date, the NEED TO SURVIVE. Irrespective of faith and sensibilities, every man in this city is fighting to survive. Some in the maddening rush of their lives, and some in their own actions. And having lived 2 years in the city now, I have come to peace with such an act.
As the stations arrive one by one, I realize that this compartment is full of cripples and 'differently abled' people as this is the compartment of handicapped. I would have loved to say that I actually did not feel out of place, but the truth is, the only thing that i felt there was the feeling of dwarf ness. I felt like a midget before their spirit to live and to fight. The stations rushed by and gave me the once again familiar sight of apartment after apartment as I entered the suburbs, and the urban chaos around them.
As I finish my 45 min walk, with music in my ears as an accomplice during this journey of rediscovering life, I realize that every man has his own story to tell and his fortune to weave. And this journey that they undertake in their lives is a far greater battle than the one which I had just experienced.

Capturing data such as heart rate, calories burned, training zone and intensity has proved to be attractive to small group training participants. Heart rate monitors and wearable technology help each participant train at the right intensity based on their own body metrics.
How It WorksThe small group training experience is significantly enhanced when technology is incorporated into the programming. Capturing information motivates members to exercise in their ideal heart rate zone and get the most out of each workout. This data, ranging from heart rate to intensity points earned, is displayed onscreen throughout a class and then emailed after the session. Because members are able to keep track of their progress, they are more confident in their training. Having context and insight into their training increases member loyalty to a club and overall demand for such classes.
Member SatisfactionWearable technology in the small group training arena has proven to engage members through motivation with visible metrics during and after the workout. Although members may not see immediate results in their bodies, they do have the numbers detailing their work, which is encouraging and helps to maintain memberships. The key to engaging and maintaining members is to ensure that they completely understand the numbers they see in front of them on the screen. If members don’t understand what the technology is doing for them, they won’t completely grasp the value.
Greater Business GrowthClub operators are discovering that wearable technology is worth the investment. Clubs are quickly seeing a return on their investment. One independent club operator, who has 3 clubs (2 with the AccuroFit Dynamic Heart Rate Display installed), has seen an increase of 30% and 17% respectively in year-over-year revenue growth in the 2 clubs with the technology implemented and utilized. The 3rd club, without the technology implemented, only saw an increase in yearover-year revenue of 7%. Club operators who choose to sell wearable technology at their front desk, or as a part of the class itself, typically find an increase in revenue. By displaying the value of wearable technology, clubs bolster accountability with their members. The value is in the numbers that members see in their workouts and that club operators see in their sales. Adding technology to small group training is proving to consistently create a unique setting that is both enjoyable and appealing to participants as well as advantageous to the club’s bottom line.

I’m not kidding. I witnessed it with my own eyes, or at least I saw the difference the dreaded tape measured before my UltraSlim session and immediately after.
Although generally as much an enemy as the scales, this go-round the tape measurer fast became my friend, though I admittedly wasn’t a fan when I first entered the procedure room at the doctor’s office, there for my first UltraSlim session.
In fact, when Lauren, one of Dr. Tim Kosterman’s great assistants, came toward me with it, I wanted to scream noooooo way. I thought better of it, though, remembering my promise to myself to give the session and the requirements that came along with it every chance to work.
To bring you up to speed, I’m on a road to thinner and, after some research and a talk with Dr. Kosterman, I have opted to try the UltraSlim system, a non-invasive body slimming procedure that removes fat and reduces inches without surgery. There are no needles, no incisions, no recovery time and no reported side effects. Mind you, this isn’t a quick fix nor a miracle procedure that ensures I will be a slimmer, trimmer me until the day I die. No such thing exists except a change of mindset and eating habits that ensure we are taking in less calories than we burn in a day’s time. UltraSlim just helps put you on the right path; the rest is each person’s responsbility.
So, I agreed to be measured, albeit begrudgingly and with more than a modicum of embarrasment.
Once that horrific task was done, the session began. It was, quite frankly, a breeze. You just ease onto a table, read your texts, do a little work or make some phone calls while the machine does all the heavy lifting. Interruptions occur every eight minutes as your assistant returns to instruct you to turn over. You stretch out on your right side, then your left, then your stomach and finally your back; 32 or so minutes later you’re all done.
Or at least I thought so, until Lauren returned, pointed at a plush white robe and said “put this on, you’ve got some shakin’ to do.”
The grin told me I was in for a surprise, and a laughable one I might add.
It seems once the procedure opens the fat cells, you have to take a few minutes to, well, shake them up a bit, and start moving them in the right direction so they leave your body.
I slipped on the robe and headed out the door as Lauren instructed, and there, waiting in the hallways was this machine that looked much like a treadmill.
I was told to step on and, more importantly, hold on. Doing so without question. Lauren grinned again, my first clue that something was about to happen.
Like the speed of light, she flipped a switch and the machine began to shake me from my head to my toes. It didn’t warm up to a faster pace, it went from zero to 60 in a flash, taking my body on a journey far more rigorous than any twist I’ve ever attempted to do on the dance floor.
Ten minutes later, it stopped.
Back in the room and ready to dress and head out, I got surprise number two — a garmet much akin to what my grandmother used to call “a girtle.”
Noooo way, I thought, thinking of what that body-binding garmet was going to feel like when a hot flash commenced.Again, I remembered my promise, took the garment and squeezed into it, knowing it was being used to help keep my body’s shape in tact as the fat seeped from my cells and my skin began to loosen because of it.
I told you losing inches, or weight, was never easy.
But lose it I did. My pants already feel looser and my resolve — to walk more and drink six or eight bottles of water every day, eat more meat and veggies and partake of less sugar — was stronger.
The program is working in more ways than one and I’ve just got started. Who knows what will happen by the time Week 8 rolls around.
I’ll let you know then. Keep your fingers crossed.

Really, that's how she plays peekaboo. Isn't she a doll?
Mike went out of town for a few days to partake in a bachelor party for an old friend. Yeah, you could say I'm the best wife ever. I mean, I wouldn't say it. But you could.
Sadly, Mike missed the big neighborhood race. One Will had looked forward to all week.
"I'm going to run REALLY fast, Mommy."
But I think what he meant to say was, "I'm going to run REALLY fast for the first minute, and then I'm going to cry REALLY loud in a dramatic fashion until you carry me the rest of the way." Yeah, that sounds more like it.
The big race was a big bust. Luckily, Grandma was around for Amelia duty so I only had one cry baby on my hands.
Then, as if the race wasn't fun enough, there was face painting too. And about 20 minutes into waiting, I would begin to regret drawing Will's attention to the face painter. After about an hour of waiting, I really regretted it.
In fact, Will waited until we stood in line for one hour, 5 minutes (with, at that point, only 2 kids in front of us) to decide he was all done and ready to go home. And I was all, "Hell naw. I don't care if I have to hold him down kicking and screaming, Dude is getting painted."
One hour, 15 minutes later, we had a snake. And then we could leave.
But the fun was just getting started because, when we returned home, it was time to celebrate Grandma's birthday.
Will gets so giddy over birthday parties. He insisted on hiding so he could yell 'Surprise!' when my mom walked through the door that morning.
He picked a Tangled party theme for Grandma.
This is what happens when you leave the room for half a minute and Grandma has cake in front of her. Me thinks we will have a successful cake smash for her first birthday.
And speaking of the big first birthday (2 weeks from today - eek!), Amelia got a special present in the mail last week from Aunt Kelly and Grammy. A pretty pink rocking chair with her name on it. Except, she thinks it's for standing on.
Will wanted a picture of both of them in their rocking chairs.
Will's fake smile...
Amelia's fake smile...
Then we had to switch chairs. Can you tell Will was directing this photo shoot?
Finally, Amelia remembered that rocking chairs are for standing on.

Is it my imagination, or do you live in Pleasantville? Seriously, your neighborhood looks so charming! Cute post, and cute pics, as always :)
I feel like in the picture with cake all over her face, Amelia almost looks like she is smirking "Yeah, I have cake all over me. Waddaya gonna do about it?"

Not just for his influence on United States politics, but the man himself was somewhat of an enigma and loved by those who knew him well. He had a strong attention to detail and was well-versed in many areas of life from horticulture to architecture. In case you don’t know much about Jefferson, the man rather than just the American legend, here are ten interesting facts about our nation’s third president.
- Monticello means “little mountain” in Italian
Monticello, meaning “little mountain” in Italian, took forty years to complete (photo courtesy of Martin Falbisoner)Just a quick little intro into a project that took up a large portion of Jefferson’s life. The hilltop was part of the 1,000 acres he inherited upon turning twenty-one. The hill was a favorite spot of Jefferson’s childhood, and he chose it build his home. Not far from Monticello is the childhood home of Jefferson, Shadwell, which was one of the largest tobacco farms in Virginia. Shadwell burned down after construction had begun on Monticello, so Jefferson moved into the South Pavilion.
- Monticello is an architectural wonder
Monticello’s dome was inspired by Jefferson’s time in Paris as Minister to France (photo courtesy of Eric Langhorst)Unlike anything at the time (or since), Jefferson’s Monticello speaks volumes of his personality. A man of varying interests, it’s no wonder the immaculate forty-three-room house took forty years to complete. The dome topping the house was inspired by one of Jefferson’s visits to Paris. The dome was the first to be placed on a home in America, and the oculus (the circular window) was made in Austria. Needless to mention, Jefferson was also a man of refined (expensive) tastes. Including the oculus, there are thirteen skylights throughout the mansion, allowing for plenty of natural lighting.A lesser known tidbit about Monticello: the cat doors. Jefferson had small, round holes cut in many of the doors on the upper level to allow the cats to move about freely while chasing mice.
- Jefferson was an accomplished architect
The Virginia State Capitol was inspired by the Roman temple Maison Carrée in Southern France (photo courtesy of Ron Cogswell)
At the north end of the Lawn at the University of Virginia, the Rotunda stands at half the height and width of Rome’s Pantheon
Monticello wasn’t the only building designed by Thomas Jefferson. His designs are proudly displayed in the form of the Virginia State Capitol and the main buildings of the University of Virginia.
Jefferson was America’s minister to France when he designed the new state capitol building for Richmond. While there, Jefferson was inspired by the Maison Carrée, a Roman temple in southern France dating back to the reign of Caesar Augustus. He commissioned French architect Charles-Louis Clerisseau to draft his idea for the capitol and sent a scale model back to the U.S. The model is still displayed at the Virginia State Capitol. The building itself was completed in 1788.
In 1819 Jefferson founded his greatest contribution to education, the University of Virginia. He designed the Academical Village, a place where he envisioned everyday life flowing seamlessly into academic life. Faculty and students alike lived in the buildings surrounding the sprawling lawn, which is still a life center of the university. At the north end of the Lawn stands the Rotunda. It stands at half of the height and width of Rome’s Pantheon, Jefferson’s inspiration behind his designs.
- He was a slave owner
Accomplished lawyer, horticulturalist, and architect to name a few, Thomas Jefferson was one of the most interesting men to grace American historyJefferson spent much of his time in the political arena pushing legislation that he hoped would end slavery in the United States. Which is why many people find it hard to reconcile their idea of Jefferson with the fact that the man was a slave owner. Over the course of his lifetime, Jefferson owned just more than 600 slaves, freeing only a few upon his death. And although he advocated abolition, he feared it as well. He believed it would be best that freed slaves be sent overseas, as a racial war was surely to erupt. But he also believed that if slavery continued in the United States, a civil war would break out dividing the nation.
- Jefferson actually only has one invention to his name
The only invention to be fully credited to Jefferson, the moldboard of least resistance, earned him a gold medal from the Parisian Society of Agriculture in 1807It’s commonly believed that Jefferson was a great inventor with multiple inventions attributed to him. That’s partly true. Jefferson was a great inventor, but only three of the many attributed to him are actually believed to be his. And only one is certain. The majority of the rest are improvements on existing inventions. Jefferson didn’t believe in patents either.Still, Jefferson is credited with three inventions: the cipher wheel, the spherical sundial, and the moldboard of least resistance. The moldboard of least resistance (allowing the plow to go through the soil with the least resistance possible) is the only one certain to be of Jefferson’s own design. Jefferson was awarded a gold medal from the Parisian Society of Agriculture in 1807 for the invention, which has been regarded as a significant contribution to the agricultural field.
- He was rather fond of the English pea
Jefferson grew 250 varieties of vegetables in the gardens of Monticello (photo courtesy of Billy Hathorn)Jefferson cultivated 250 varieties of vegetables at his Monticello gardens. Of those, he grew fifteen varieties of the English pea. Each year there was a contest among Jefferson and the neighboring farms to see who could produce the first pea crop of the season. The winner would then host a dinner for the other neighbors. It seems that despite his best efforts and knowledge of agriculture, Jefferson lost each year to his neighbor, George Divers. Jefferson’s grandson once noted that he remembers his grandfather producing the first crop one year, but gracefully bowing out, as to let Divers believe he had won again.
- He was a doting grandfather
Jefferson was a doting father and grandfather. His daughter, Martha Jefferson Randolph, gave birth to twelve children, eleven of which survived to adulthood. (Portrait by Thomas Sully)Jefferson was close to his family, and much of his extended family lived at Monticello at one time or another. Twelve of his grandchildren survived to adulthood, eleven of them belonging to his beloved daughter Martha, and one to his daughter Maria. He enjoyed his retirement listening to his grandchildren playing throughout the home, playing with them in the yard, or writing frequent letters to them when apart. His granddaughter Ellen, who he was especially close to, once remarked that he was “her earliest best friend.”
- He was an avid reader
After the Library of Congress was burned in the War of 1812, Jefferson sold his collection of 6,487 books to Congress. After suffering loss to fire once more, the Library of Congress is currently reconstructing Jefferson’s collection. (Photo courtesy of the Library of Congress)Jefferson was once quoted as saying to John Adams, “I cannot live without books.” And seemingly so. An avid reader, Jefferson collected books throughout his travels. At his Monticello library he amassed the largest personal book collection in the United States. After the British burned the Library of Congress during the War of 1812, Jefferson sold his collection of 6,487 books to Congress for $23,950. He began collecting books once again, which were sold in an auction in 1829 to cover some of Jefferson’s large debt.
- Jefferson died on Independence Day
Jefferson died on July 4, 1826, on the fiftieth anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence. Coincidentally, John Adams died five hours before on the same day.More notably, Thomas Jefferson died on July 4, 1826, fifty years after signing the Declaration of Independence. He was eighty-two and died in his bed at his beloved Monticello. More than a stone’s throw away in Quincy, Massachusetts, Jefferson’s friend-turned-political-adversary—and then once again friend—John Adams, lay on his own deathbed. Jefferson passed nearly five hours before Adams. Unaware of this information, Adams was quoted as saying before passing, “Thomas Jefferson still survives.”
- He enjoyed a good glass of wine
A lover of wine, Jefferson installed a wine cellar in the basement of Monticello, complete with a custom wine dumbwaiterUnderneath Monticello, Jefferson had a well-stocked wine cellar complete with dumbwaiters designed by Jefferson solely for the transfer of wine bottles to the dining area. Jefferson came to appreciate the fine wine of France and Italy during his time as minister to France. He once wrote, “In nothing have the habits of the palate more decisive influence than in our relish of wines.” Upon returning to the U.S., Jefferson planted two vineyards at Monticello in the south orchard. Despite his hope, the vitis vinifera grapes did not grow well in the Virginia soil. He had hoped to make wine from his Monticello grapes but never made a single bottle. Still, his efforts led the way for future vineyards in the region, and Jefferson has since been labeled as America’s “first distinguished viticulturist.” He would be pleased to know that the vineyards have been replanted at Monticello, with many bottles made from their harvests.This basically means that all websites listed in the online casino rankings comply with each and every requirement found on the list, ensuring online players coming from online casinos review United States are guaranteed a safe and secure gaming environment and a website that is specifically tailored to suit their needs.

VIDEO: State Police Distracted Driving PSA
The new study released by the state’s Office of Highway Safety Planning says more than eighty percent of drivers believe talking on phones makes a crash more likely, but 56 percent admit to having cell phone conversations behind the wheel.
“It appears drivers are aware of the dangers of being distracted by cell phones and texting,” said Michael L. Prince, the safety planning office’s director. “But the ability and pressure to be constantly connected and available seem to trump traffic safety as motorists continue to talk and text while driving.”
The study was released to coincide with the start of April, which is National Distracted Driving Awareness month. The Michigan State Police have also released a new public service announcement that details the danger of distracted driving.
The survey was done by the Glengariff Group, inc, and can be viewed online.
It does show a consensus on the dangers of texting while driving. 96 percent of drivers feel that’s dangerous, with 42 percent saying it’s as dangerous as driving while drunk. About eight percent of drivers admitted to texting behind the wheel.
The study also showed that younger drivers were more likely to engage in distracted behavior.
Sujin first began her violin studies with Alice Waten at the Australian Institute of Music as a scholarship holder on the Young Musicians Programme. After graduating from high school, Sujin put music on hold and studied law and business administration for two years. However, her love of music drew her back to the violin and she went on to study with Goetz Richter at the Sydney Conservatorium of Music in 2009.
Sujin subsequently moved to London to study at the Royal College of Music, graduating with first class bachelor’s and master’s degrees as an ABRSM scholar and later a Frederick Johnson Scholar, supported by a Greenbank Award and the Lydia Napper Award.
Sujin has won numerous awards, notably first prize in the Dorcas McClean Travelling Scholarship Competition (2009), finalist and prize-winner in the Royal Overseas League
Competition (2012), first prize of the Jeunesses International Violin Competition (2012) and winner of the two-year loan of a modern Bergonzi violin in the Michael Hill International Violin Competition (2013). In 2012, Sujin was also selected to take part in the London Symphony Orchestra String Experience Scheme.
Participating in festivals in the US and in Israel, Sujin has enjoyed being involved in many chamber projects and performances and has had the opportunity to perform in many venues around the globe, her most recent appearance as a soloist with the Little Chamber Orchestra in London.

What do you love about classical music?
I find the depth of emotion and character, as well as the profound way in which it can bring people together without any words, amazing. And it’s just so fascinating how even one phrase can hold such different meaning to different people, and from there, how one piece can be told in such unique ways by different artists.
But aside from all that, classical music just moves my soul more than anything. There are moments when I’m practising where I have to pause because I’ve been so overwhelmed by a melody or harmonic progression.
What or who inspired you to become a professional musician?
More than any particular person, it was during my two year break from music and the violin that I came to realise how much I actually missed and loved playing.
What is your most embarrassing or amusing musical moment?
In a competition, I was drawn as the first contestant and opened with Paganini Caprice No. 17 which starts with a unison E flat. Very dangerous. And what could have gone wrong… went wrong. More than being mortified, I felt so sorry for the audience. My professor and I still shake our heads over it.

There’s just something impossibly admirable about the figures who excel most at the sports we love. We imagine playing sports like they do, we imagine their lifestyles, and we enjoy watching them play about as much as anything. Some people find this kind of attention to be a little much, but really there’s nothing improper about it. There’s certainly nothing wrong with being a fan, and in some cases it can even inspire you to seek amusement or self-betterment where you might not have otherwise.
With that in mind, here are a few fun things you can do to feel a little bit closer to the athletes you idolize.
Hit The Gym
One reason we idolize these figures is that in a way they tend to represent the very best of the human race – at least from a standpoint of physical capability. Professional athletes are incredibly fit, and tend to stay that way for years at a time. They do it partially through access to full training staffs and cutting edge equipment, and for that reason you might not ever be able to attain their level. But getting more exercise, whether at the local YMCA or through a personal trainer that comes to your home, can at least help you feel like you’re following a similar path. You might even be able to find specific workout plans suggested by your favorite athletes.
Go Watch In Person
This is easier said than done, particularly if you don’t happen to live near where your favorite athletes play. But it’s still the best way to gain a closer connection to the sports figures you admire most. Plus, finding tickets to sporting events has never been easier. There are multiple online aggregator tools that make secondhand ticket sales intuitive and affordable. With a little bit of planning and initiative, you can get yourself pretty good seats to most any sporting event around.
Heed Their Sponsorships
You don’t need to go overboard in this regard, in that it’s silly to buy products you don’t actually need. But when you do need something, it can deepen your connection to a favorite athlete to take a look at whatever version of that something he or she sponsored. Whether that means heading to the local car dealership to check out the latest vehicle being advertised by an NBA star, or shopping for a new watch sported by tennis and golf pros, it’s worth keeping in mind. Sports stars are always promoting one item or another, and more often than not they seem to have great taste.
Get In On The Action
If you’re passionate about a given athletic figure, chances are you already feel closer to the action when he or she is playing. But for a lot of fans, special promotions and bets represent a way to get even closer to a contest. For instance, just recently online gamers had the chance to “score” by picking the Champions League winner. Countless sports fans undoubtedly cashed in when the Warriors won the NBA Finals. And a month from now fans around the world will be wagering on which star tennis players will triumph on the beautiful grasses of Wimbledon. Betting always carries some risk, of course, but even a small bet can help you to feel closer to the action.
All of this ought to help you feel closer than ever to your favorite athletes. It might sound like a bit much to some, but if you’ve ever truly idolized a sports figure, it should all make perfect sense.Logging in with a Wargaming.net account now plugs you into "all other Wargaming-related projects," including partner and fan websites reachable via OpenID authentication.

Prof. Tam David-West was minister of petroleum and energy when President Muhammadu Buhari was head of state. He tells OLUFEMI ATOYEBI that the office of the minister of state should be scrapped, among other issues
What is your comment on the recent $25bn oil contract controversy at the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation?
When I first read it in the newspaper, I was flabbergasted. It is out of the question completely. I have said I will never comment on NNPC, but it would be irresponsible of me to keep quiet. It is dangerous. Despite the fact that I am no longer the oil minister, I know what is happening in the oil industry every day. I am still in touch with the system in Nigeria and even the North Sea Oil, Brent, I get the price every day.
I am interested in the oil industry just like any other Nigerian, for obvious reasons. Oil accounts for 80 per cent of the Nigerian budget and 90 per cent of its assets outside. The money we have outside and foreign reserves are mainly from oil. As someone from an oil-producing state, I am interested in what goes on in the industry. Thirdly, I have been there before and I know what is happening there..
When I read Kachikwu’s letter, I was flabbergasted. But I was relieved when the NNPC replied that nothing like that happened. There is a danger in having Kachikwu loyalists and Baru loyalists in the same sector. It is very dangerous for the nation.
When I wanted to recommend a managing director for Buhari as his minister when he was the head of state, three people who were qualified were vying for the position. I called them to my office at night after close of work and told them that they were all qualified but that I would choose Aret Adams.
Why did you do that?
One of them had contested the position and the other one was also interested in the position at a time in the past. They both had loyalists in the company. It would not augur well for the industry. That was why I chose someone who was fresh.
As a minister, Rivers State indigenes organised a reception for me, but I told them that I would not attend and that they should cancel it. I did that because I did not want to make myself a sectional minister. I was a minister for everybody. Buhari appointed me as a Nigerian minister and not as a Rivers minister.
Something must be done quickly before it puts the oil industry in jeopardy. The whole world is watching what we are doing in Nigeria. No one should do anything that will put the nation’s oil industry in jeopardy. If there is a problem in an industry, how can we attract foreign investors? They will be scared to come to Nigeria to invest in the country. No one wants to come to a country that is not safe. There must be a favourable atmosphere for them to come. If you give an impression that NNPC is not conducive, no one will come.
If you predict a bad thing and it comes to pass, you will be sad. But if you predict a good thing and it comes to pass, you will be happy. I am sad because I have predicted that something like this would happen one day.
When Rilwan Lukman was the Minister of Petroleum Resources and he carved out about 11 to 12 subsidiaries out of the NNPC, I said it was dangerous. I was supported by a prominent Nigerian oil technocrat, Chief Feide. I pointed out that what Lukman was doing was not good for Nigeria. I said it would be dangerous because what we are going to have are pockets of autonomies. Now it has happened. How can you refer to the NNPC as a parastatal? It is a parent body for all the subsidiaries carved out from it. It should not be under any ministry. Even now, it is not under any ministry.
But there is the Ministry of Petroleum Resource. Is the NNPC not responsible to it?
It is a ludicrous thing. The NNPC is a parent body. Was there a Ministry of Petroleum Resources in (Shehu) Shagari’s time and during Buhari’s first term in government? Let me clarify this, what we have is the ‘Department of Petroleum Resources’ and not a ministry.
But Kachikwu is today the chairman of the NNPC Board. Is there not a mix-up?
Buhari made him the chairman of the NNPC board. The chairman of that board does not have to be a minister.
Is Buhari not doing too much as a president and minister of petroleum?.
Shouldn’t Buhari step down as minister since the 18 months have passed?
He will decide when to take that decision but that title of minister of state should be scrapped or called ‘minister without portfolio.’
Would you recommend he choose a substantive minister?
Buhari is a competent man when it comes to the oil sector. I learnt a lot from him when I became minister.
Don’t you think that based on his complaint, Kachikwu has been sidelined?.
What is your comment on the restructuring agitations?
I am writing an article titled, ‘Restructure, constitution and scapegoatism.’ Fear is the cause of this agitation. (Charles) Darwin’s theory of organic evolution underscores that God restructures from time to time by restructuring the animals that inhabit the world from time to time. I am fully in support of restructuring. My only fear is that those who are clamouring for it are not sincere. They cannot define clearly what they mean by restructuring. It is hypocrisy and stupid.
People blame Lord Lugard for amalgamating the southern and northern protectorate. The company he represented asked him to do so because of administrative reasons. He executed the amalgam and it is left for us to form a nation. There is a difference between an amalgam and a compound. Lugard did the amalgam but it is left for us to create a compound out of it to form a nation. He has done nothing wrong. He did not come to create a Nigeria. If what he did was so bad, why did we celebrate 100 years of amalgamation?
Will the Petroleum Industry Bill see the light of day and will it have positive effect on Nigeria’s oil industry?
The PIB will make foreign companies investment in oil business in Nigeria difficult. The bill is meant to correct the oil industry but there are lots of taxes in it. It will not encourage what we call joint venture partnership. The taxes will chase investors away. They may not tell us the truth but the reality is that many oil companies are divesting from Nigeria secretly. They are taking their assets out of Nigeria without making a noise about it. Before now, many oil companies objected to a lot of clauses in it. They inject a lot of money into the industry, they pay royalty, they pay taxes and now you want to add more burden on them. The PIB has clauses that are burdensome. If you consider the politically unfavourable atmosphere in Nigeria, the electric car issue, alternative source of energy and so on, the future of oil business in Nigeria is in jeopardy. We will suffer more because we depend on oil. Nigeria depends only on oil. We only talk about diversification without acting on it.
What is your view on the search for oil in the northern part of Nigeria?
This is the typical Nigerian factor. They have made this issue political. Kachikwu assured the North that by January, he would strike oil in the region. I will continue to mention his name. Before I became minister of petroleum, a lot of money had been spent on the search for oil in the North and the search stopped. When I came, I called Aret Adams and told him that we should try again. He said a lot of money had been spent without getting even gas in that area. Adams was in charge of exploration at the time. I insisted that we try once more in 1984. I gave him six weeks to get me a rig. In four weeks, he got a rig for me and I bought it and took delivery of it at the Port Harcourt harbour. I took it to Gaji Gana to begin the search all over again. We started digging but we could not find anything. On my way to Maiduguri (in Borno State), I had an accident and almost died. I told Buhari what happened.
Before we left Gaji Gana, someone wrote in the newspaper that oil had been discovered in the North. I told my personal assistant to counter the report that it was not true. I said it would be better to use the money to build schools and hospitals for our people instead of wasting that money. That was the background to the search for oil in the North. I was shown two wells that were drilled but which were closed because they could not find oil there. It was like a wild goose chase. The search for oil has been made political. On the French side of Chad there is oil so, they said there should be oil on the Nigerian side. I alerted the nation that foreign countries were not willing to go to the North and start looking for oil. If there was oil there, they would have rushed to the place. Some read conspiracy theory to it but I said I and Adams are from the Niger Delta and we made so much effort to find oil in the North.
Why then is the search still going on?
Let us assume that there is oil there, is it in commercial quantity? If you say technically you have oil there, the only reason for anyone to go there and dig is if it is in commercial quantity, else, it is a waste of time and money. Some years ago, northern governors came together and said they would explore the possibility of getting oil in the North. It was a good move to jointly look for oil there. I have the record. They thought NNPC was not serious enough about it.
I wrote a three-page article titled, ‘Ankali, Ankali (be careful)’. I gave them the history of oil search in the Chad basin, the record of failures, how much was spent and how I bought a rig and took it there. I advised them to spend the money on education and health instead of spending it on the search. A professor from Maiduguri said I was wrong so they continued. I knew it was a chase that would not be fruitful.
More than a decade after giving refinery licence to investors, none has been built. What could be wrong with the initiative?
This is an interesting country. The first thing is that during Babangida’s era, they (the government) proposed to sell our refineries and (people) kicked against it. They changed it and said they wanted participation whereby someone would come and manage them for us. I said it was a risky move. They wanted to buy a refinery for Nigeria abroad and I wrote to Babangida (speaking) against it. They were beating about the bush. I said we were not facing the music. If we bought a refinery abroad, would it help our workforce at home? NNPC has competent staff in Nigeria.
Are private refineries the solution? They can only complement our own refineries. I wrote an article and said our refineries were sabotaged. Many years after, the Senate confirmed my claim. If our refineries are working, no one will import fuel. Fuel importation is a fraudulent business. The cabal and the unpatriotic people behind fuel importation know why our refineries were sabotaged. I conducted a study and found out that each time the refineries broke down, the same part would break down from each of them.
How can Nigeria stop the sabotage?
Except we stop importation of fuel, it will not stop. We had three refineries in my time and we never imported a litre of fuel. We were even exporting it. Private refineries are good but not the solution.
Why do you think those already handed licences to run private refineries yet to begin operations?
It is capital intensive and after you have built it you will have to get the crude from Nigeria. That is where the problem is. Our quota according to the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is about two million barrels per day. Many with the licences did not study the implication. Is Nigeria ready to cut its exportation of crude and prefer to sell to the private refineries? Can we satisfy both markets without exceeding the OPEC quota? I once told the late MKO Abiola that with all his wealth, he would not be able to start oil business alone. You need foreign partners. It is attractive but when you get to the details, you will slow down.
But we have people who locally refine crude in the creeks. How are they finding it easy to do?
I am happy you brought that issue. The militants refine few litres for their daily use. That is not the type of quantity we need. They talk of modular refinery but even though that is easy to build, it cannot solve our problem. When we sit down to face the problem really, we will find a solution.
Can private refineries bring down fuel price in Nigeria?
The answer is yes and no. It will bring it down if the investors have enough crude to refine massively. But the question is that will they have enough because of the OPEC quota that we cannot exceed.
More than $153m has permanently seized from former Minister of Petroleum Resources, Diezani Alison-Madueke while $9.2m allegedly was found in the home of former GMD of NNPC, Andrew Yakubu. Is Nigeria actually monitoring its oil business the way it should be managed?
I am happy and I am sad over this issue. I am sad that a Nigerian public officer could have such amount of money at home. This is a country that cannot pay N18,000 minimum wage to its workers. I am vindicated because I have always challenged anyone to come out and prove me as a corrupt minister. I never took money from anyone I awarded a contract or involved myself in oil business. A former Inspector General of Police once told me that Babangida was always sending spies to trail me anytime I travelled abroad to know how I got money. He said Babangida suspected that I was making money outside. I have forgiven him. He jailed me for life for taking a wristwatch (as a gift). If I wanted to be corrupt, will taking wristwatch (as a gift) be my target? I occupied top positions and never corruptly enriched myself. All the charges were lies. As a minister, my signature could command multimillion-dollars. It is not how much wealth you amass but the legacy you leave behind.
I know Dieziani very well. She was in Shell before; so I was surprised that she did what she did. How could she enrich herself so much? The PIB that was proposed was personalised. It gave the minister more power in the sector and she made sure it was so while she was there. If without the PIB, she made billions, with it, she would have stolen trillions.."

President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday responded to allegations that the Igbo were under-represented in his government, saying that the South East region was not marginalised in appointments into his cabinet.
Receiving some leaders from the region who visited him at the Presidential Villa in Abuja yesterday, President Buhari said there are “four substantive ministers” from the South East region while seven states in the North only got appointments as ministers of state.
Buhari said: “I gave the.”
President Buhari also assured stakeholders from the South East, who were led by Deputy Senate President Ike Ekweremadu, that the region would benefit more from roads and coastal rail projects, which he said are of critical importance to the economy.
The President, according to a statement issued by his Special Adviser on Media and publicity, Mr. Femi Adesina, declared that the 2nd Niger Bridge, the East-West Road and the Coastal rail project were receiving utmost attention from his administration.
He said that counterpart funding from the Chinese government would substantially fund the projects, which when completed would improve the welfare, well-being and economy of the people in the region.
The President said:  also promised the leaders, comprising governors and ministers from the region, the President of Ohanaeze, Chief Nnia Nwodo and representatives from the National Assembly, that he will visit the states in the zone soon.

Bank of England
rate-setters voted unanimously to keep quantitative easing
at its current level, it was revealed today, despite lower inflation that has led economists to predict a new round of money printing.
The Bank of England was yesterday given leeway to unleash another round of quantitative easing to bolster the ailing economy after official figures showed inflation eased back to 2.5 per cent in August after a shock rise from 2.4 per cent in June to 2.6 per cent in July.
Analysts said lower inflation paves the way for the Bank to pump yet
more money into the economy having already sanctioned the printing of
£375billion since March 2009. Many economists believe the economy is so weak the Bank will feel
compelled to act again in November when the current round of QE runs
out.
QE boost? The Bank of England could pump more cash to bolster the economy after official figures showed inflation fell to 2.5 per cent in August
WHAT NEXT FOR RATES?
A higher UK bank rate remains a long way off, according to money markets. But the forecast for the first increase has moved forward after the recent ‘QE3′ announcement in the US.
The flow of newly printed money will increase global price pressure, and possibly the eventual need for rate rises, the market believes.
Interest rate futures, which forecast a cut from 0.50 per cent to 0.25 per cent early next year, now predict a rise to 0.75 per cent for late 2016; they were previously earmarking late 2017.
Read more: What next for rates?
Annalisa Piazza, an economist at
broker Newedge Strategy, said: ‘With inflation expected to run at around
2 per cent in early 2013, we still see chances of additional QE at the
November meeting.’
An extension to the asset purchase
program would pile more pain on to savers.
The policy helps to keep
interest rates lower, keep returns on savings pots at low levels, while
having a generally inflationary effect that erodes the value of nest
eggs.
A report yesterday revealed that average
savers have lost hundreds of pounds in value over the past five years
because of rock bottom interest rates and the rising cost of living..
The small fall in inflation is
overshadowed by the fact that the CPI has been above its two per cent
target, set by the Government, for nearly three years.
Throughout this period, interest rates paid on savings have been desperately low, with many accounts paying close to zero.
Feeling the squeeze: Families are faced with high petrol prices and low interest rates paid on savings
Sylvia
Waycot, a financial expert from Moneyfacts, said: ‘Once again, we have
the ridiculous situation where we have more savings accounts that don’t
beat inflation than those that do.’
TABLES: BEST CASH ISAs
Of the 1,017 savings accounts on the market, just 198 pay an interest
rate high enough to beat the impact of tax and inflation for a basic
rate taxpayer.
To make matters worse, a report from Saga, the over-50s specialist, said inflation is typically higher for older people.
This is because older consumers tend to spend more on things, such as electricity and food, where prices are rising faster.
Over
the past five years, prices have jumped by 16.8 per cent for the
population, but by 22.6 per cent for those aged 75 and over.
The fall in inflation came as furniture and clothing
prices as well as gas and electricity bills increased by less than a
year ago – raising hopes that inflation will finally fall to the 2 per
cent target for the first time since late 2009.
Rising petrol and food
prices threaten to push inflation higher in the coming months –
prolonging the squeeze on family finances as wage growth remains muted –
but economists believed there would be scope for a further stimulus..

Maybe someone at the bank has read what the President of the Bunesbank said this week. He laughed at the European Central Bank proposal to buy the debt of Spain, Portugal, Greece and Italy etc with eurobonds. The eurobonds have no real currency behind them, they are made of valueless Monopoly money and will naturally created huge inflation. The inflation will in turn devalue the euro. and ruin all eurozone economies. NO MORE VALUELESS POUNDS THANK YOU.

The problem isn’t that there isn’t enough Cash in the System , quite the opposite, there is NO NEED FOR QUANTITATIVE EASING. The Money Lenders, the PUPPET MASTERS need to decide that they have inflicted enough damage on the Population. For Centuries they have claimed to be Victims, given the Financial Chaos they have created, the Facts Speak for them selves.

THD Halesworth, yes deflation would be a problem, but where exactly do you see the signs of it? “Ideal” inflation was defined as between 1 and 2% and we are seemingly permanently locked in to over this figure. Over target inflation is deliberate. It is a way of trying to inflate away the banks and the governments debts. – Littlebodge , Brighton ~~~~~~~ Exactly. And if pensioners and responsible people who are saving for their retirement (which is what the government is telling us to do) have to be sacrificed in the process then so be it. The millionaire David Cameron and his rich cronies in the cabinet couldn’t give a toss because they will be more than comfortable in their retirement whatever happens.

Ddflation would be a good thing. We have had if for years in many consumer goods with the computer probably leading the way in terms of increased bang for the buck. People still manage to buy them. Some people would of course delay the purchase of items as they do now but that could only be good for our trade deficit. They wouldn’t delay for long because in the long run we are all dead. ‘Must have it now’ is hard wired. House price deflation? Well they should be around half what they are now.

It really does confound me that this destructive cycle is allowed to continue; until there is a change in the systemic structure of UK politics, NOTHING will change. Lab, Con, Lab, Lab, Con, Con, Con, Lab, Con, Lab, Lab, Lab, Con… ad infinitum. Nothing ever changes. Hence why I am attempting to use a protest vote in the next election, but I don’t expect much to happen as there is always going to be a hardcore elite in the main 3s camp, coupled with new voters excited about the prospect of voicing their political backings for the 1st/2nd time (which *usually* comes from parents’ allegiances), which is nowhere near experienced enough to have a holistic view of the whole iniquitous system. The only other thing I can think of is mass revolution, but we’re all too damn apathetic for that to materialize, so my only other option is to attempt to drop out the system as much as possible; then I’m vilified for not contributing. Catch 22.

That sucked because fevers make me miserable and a miserable Sarah is not fun to be around. Thankfully, antibiotics saved the day and life improved rapidly. Then, three weeks later I had a clogged duct that was a little bit painful and extremely annoying. In case you wondered, breastfeeding isn't easy, people.
I said goodbye to my best-kitty-friend on September 4th. That was sad, but I was well prepared. It was actually a relief to send my sweet Winter off to a happier, healthier place. She was nineteen years old and had lived a very nice, long life.
Last week I returned to my part-time work, which was good but bittersweet. I'm glad to be back in the swing of things and see all my wonderful coworkers, but I miss my babies. Thankfully, they're well cared for while we're apart.Disclosure: Mama Smith’s Review Blog received this item in exchange for her honest review. All opinions expressed are 100% hers.
My young daughters love Daniel Tiger from PBS Kids. It is one of their favorite shows, and I love that because they are always learning from it. PBS Kids is my favorite TV channel that they watch because every single show teaches them something – from math, to spelling, to reading, to life lessons – they have it all. Daniel Tiger is one of the best in my opinion. He is a ton of fun and based on one of my favorite shows when I was growing up, Mr. Roger’s Neighborhood. I love watching my girls sing Daniel’s songs as they are doing things that he does. For example, when I dropped my oldest off at school for the first time she sang “Grownups come back.” like from the episode where Daniel was nervous to go to school. We use his songs all the time and I just love him! The latest DVD, Super Daniel, features NINE episodes and came out today! My daughters love the episodes on this one and so do I. We have been on a super hero kick lately so it came just in time. I really recommend Daniel Tiger – he is fun for the whole family!
It is out TODAY so purchase your DVD here.
Synopsis
ZOOM! Grab your cape and watch Daniel pretend to be Super Daniel! In the story “Super Daniel,” Dad Tiger forgets to take his lunch to work. Helping to save the day, Daniel, along with Grandpère, heads to the clock factory to ensure dad gets his lunch. Along the way, Daniel has several super adventures with his friends Prince Wednesday and Miss Elaina. Also included on this new DVD is the bonus story “Goodnight Daniel.” In this tale, Daniel is pretending to be Super Daniel when Dad Tiger lets him know he needs to get ready for bed. Young fans can follow along as Daniel takes a bath, puts on his pajamas, brushes his teeth, and gets into bed – just in time for Mom Tiger to read him a bedtime story, “Superheroes Go to Bed Too.”
One of the key ingredients that makes this series a standout, “When a friend doesn’t want to play with you, you can find something else to do,” and “Try to solve the problem yourself and you’ll feel proud.” DANIEL TIGER’S NEIGHBORHOOD, which debuted in September 2012, airs daily on PBS KIDS (check local listings).
“SUPER DANIEL!” will be available on DVD starting TODAY – February 2, 2016. The “SUPER DANIEL!” DVD includes the stories below.

I, yours truly, your tiny little monkey pal Miss Banshee…Used to teach Gymboree.
The World: What?!
Me: It’s true. I taught Gymboree in Pennsylvania approximately ten years ago.
The World: Wait. Gymboree? As in the place where all the little kids go and run around on soft objects and the mothers hang out and gossip? THAT Gymboree?
Me: Truth.
The World: No way. You? The foulmouthed, ill-tempered snarkwad with the cats? YOU taught small children and sang the songs and wore the khakis?
Me: Yes. I did.
The World: *falls down laughing*
Me: Shut up. Yes, I sang the songs and played with the kids and gossiped with the parents and babysat for my favorite kids, and had drinks with their parents and totally was part of their posse for about 6 months. I. Taught. Gymboree. And I wore the khakis.
The World: Stop! Stop! WE CANNOT STOP LAUGHING.
Me: No, it’s a story that needs to be told. I did Bubble Time, and Parachute Time, and rolled around and even changed a diaper or two in a pinch. I loved my job. I loved those kids. I remember those kids VIVIDLY. And I don’t want to think of how old they are now, because that means *I* am vair, vair old and need to go to an old person’s home.
The World: We must know HOW did a person like YOU become a Gymboree teacher? Was the recruiter blind and deaf?
Me: It’s actually an interesting story. A punk girl I knew worked at Zany Brainy, which was a toy store in PA when I moved there with my ex around 10 years ago. Maybe 9. I was promised there would be no math. Anyway, there was this grand girl who we’ll call Spike and she worked at Zany Brainy and got me a job there too. (we didn’t have to wear khakis) and I eventually got to know the girl who ran Gymboree out of an extension of Zany Brainy. Money was tight, and the ex wasn’t exactly bringing in the dough either, so I asked the girl who ran Gymboree, whom we will call Zima, if there were any job openings at Gymboree. This was back before the recession when people could actually get jobs, if you recall, there WAS such a time. As luck would have it, she was being transferred to another Gymboree and YES, she WAS looking for someone to replace her! So I took the teaching gig as a second job. This is before I lost my damn mind and COULD work, of course. I love kids, and I kinda loved Zany Brainy because if you’re going to work retail, why not have it be a toy store, right? So there you go. That’s how I got the job.
The World: People. Entrusted their children. With you.
Me: Entirely. I was like a mama bear with those kids. I loved those kids FIERCELY. Someday I’ll tell you about when I worked in a daycare. I still have DREAMS about THOSE babies.
The World: You and kids. Huh. That shouldn’t add up, yanno. You don’t exactly…
Me: …fit the khakis? Yeah, I know. What can I say? I love kids.
The World: Well you learn something new every day. But there’s one thing we must ask.
Me: Certainly.
The World: The clown. The cloooooooooooooooooooown.
Me: Gymboree’s mascot is, in fact, a clown. I disliked the clown INTENSELY, but I hated the khakis more.
The World: Now THAT we believe.
I had a very difficult time last year accepting that my first kindergarten class were graduating from COLLEGE that year. In fact, there were tears and more than a little muttering about “not fair” and “growing old” going on.

OK, I’ve only been to Gymboree when my daughter was invited to another kid’s birthday party there & I wanted to smack the overly-chipper people, and the snooty parents. Now, if YOU were the kind of person I’d have at my local Gymboree, it’d be worth the 30 minute drive!

Colleen last post: We came to some conclusions todayDILO Direct offers a low cost, low environmental impact option for either recycling or disposal of SF6 Gas and SF6 Gas cylinders.
Routine gas cart maintenance is paramount to reliability and performance. In an effort to provide DILO equipment owners the guaranteed comfort to ensure the recovery system are running to the most efficient and effective design parameters, DILO offers annual maintenance plans specifically designed for DILO recovery equipment. These comprehensive programs allow owners to know that their recovery units will be properly maintained by trained DILO technicians. With this service, you can look forward to years of trouble free service. As an incentive, when added to the purchase of a new gas
recovery device, the warranty of that unit will be extended up to two years from date of receipt.
Your system will receive a thorough inspection including: performance and functional tests; complete inspection of the plumbing and electrical systems; along with changing all on-board filters and vacuum pump oil. Furthermore, any small malfunction that might not appear for some time can be identified before it becomes a major issue, causing unnecessary downtime.
With DILO’s larger carts, such as the Economy or MEGA series, the maintenance will be completed on-site. Once the maintenance has been completed, hands-on operational training can also be provided to ensure your equipment is being properly used and to its full potential.

After a female style guide for the festive season last week, we now list what men can sport this time of the year.fashion and trends Updated: Oct 19, 2016 08:31 IST
With the ongoing festive season, there’s always pressure to step out looking your best. However, men no longer need to limit their sartorial options to simple kurtas and bandhgalas. Designers in India and abroad have been increasingly experimenting with menswear that is high on fashion and is meant for the clued-in man.
“Living in the time of Facebook and Instagram, men have a lot of exposure to global fashion trends. This has led to a change in their mindsets when it comes to clothes,” says designer Rimple Narula, one half of the designer duo Rimple and Harpreet Narula.
Designers feel that extensive overseas travelling and a tab on celebrity fashion has also enabled Indian men to open their minds to new designs, cuts and styles. “Indian men have become far more evolved and open to experimentation than ever before. It’s truly refreshing to see them take keen interest in the way they look. I believe travel has also brought in a massive change to the Indian man’s outlook and lifestyle,” says designer Kunal Anil Tanna. So, if you wish to dress to the nines this season, go in for a style shake-up and take tips from our fashion guide.
With inputs from designers Parul J Maurya and Asif Merchant.
For old time’s sake
Try out an amalgamation of the old and the new like this Burberry outfit. (Getty Images)
Going back in time for style inspiration has been the predominant theme this season. Several designers have taken references from yesteryears to create modern creations with a touch of vintage fun. So, try out an amalgamation of the old and the new like this Burberry outfit. The long shirt with a Victorian collar and the short military jacket with bronze buttons should be your pick.
Fun with Asymmetry
Asymmetrical cuts, a major trend in India and internationally, is what you should try this festive season. It adds an element of drama to your look while keeping it understated. This Kunal Anil Tanna double-shaded jacket will give you an idea.
Floral fix
Once only limited to a woman’s wardrobe, floral prints and motifs have now found a comfortable spot in menswear as well. (Getty Images)
Once only limited to a woman’s wardrobe, floral prints and motifs have now found a comfortable spot in menswear as well. If you feel that too much of it is not what you would like, try out something like this Roberto Cavalli suit with sparingly used floral motifs. This will give you the trend upgrade you need.
No set rules
Gender fluidity has emerged as the single most important trend of this season. (PTI)
Gender fluidity has emerged as the single most important trend of this season. With unisex lines creating a buzz, it’s only time that you try out something totally different this festive season. If you are feeling adventurous, go for this half-skirt, half-trouser DSquared2 look sported by actor Ranveer Singh. It is sharp, formal and oh-so-edgy.
Twist and turn
Designers Shantanu & Nikhil’s flared kurta with a bandhgala jacket is a must-have in every Indian man’s wardrobe. (PTI)
A kurta look can also be given an upgrade. Designers Shantanu & Nikhil’s flared kurta with a bandhgala jacket is a must-have in every Indian man’s wardrobe. It’s stylish, quirky and comfortable. So, this season, look no more.
Sharp turn
This Miguel Vieira creation shows us how you can experiment with your dressing without going overboard. (AFP)
Who said you can’t have fun with sharp dressing? This Miguel Vieira creation shows us how you can experiment with your dressing without going overboard. The double-breasted jacket is accentuated with a front belt, and the monochrome pants add a quirky edge to the look.
Pattern perfect

Designer Stella Jean presents an interesting take on the overall print look. Even though it’s tricky to sport this trend, if carried off with ease and confidence, it can help you stand out from the crowd.
Give me red
Paint the town red with a fiery crimson this season. (Getty Images)
Forget safe colours such as navy blue and black, and paint the town red with a fiery crimson this season. A well-tailored suit like this one designed by Malan Breton is a perfect example.
Casual chic
We have reached a point when anything can be dialed down to make it more casual. If heavy traditional wear is not your cup of tea, then something like this languid Lacoste blazer and trousers is what you should opt for. It not just gives out a cool vibe, but its slouchy fit makes it a comfortable outfit.
White wash
This Lydia Lavin long shirt adds a chic twist to your traditional wear. The Indo-western look, complete with a pair of grey trousers and a shirt with mesh and embroidery, is subtle but not run-of-the-mill.
Dos and don’ts
- While experimenting with your clothes, keep in mind your personality and body type. Not everything that is trending suits everyone. Opt for something that goes with your personality to avoid a fashion disaster.
- One shouldn’t go overboard while styling the outfit. Remember, subtle is stylish.
- Keep the focus on one element, and allow the rest of the ensemble to remain neutral.
- Don’t be afraid of playing with colours, but be careful when mixing patterns and prints.Rumah Asap Borneo KL at Cheras: Snapshot

It was named after him since he was the one who spearheaded its construction (from Wikipedia).

BATON ROUGE, LA (WAFB) -
One of Acadiana's most popular Italian and Mediterranean restaurants is coming to Baton Rouge, along with another location of a popular breakfast place.
Lafayette-based Double R Restaurant Group is building a Romacelli and a new location of Another Broken Egg Cafe. The first Romacelli and the new Another Broken Egg will be located near the corner of Airline Hwy. and Barringer Foreman Rd. Both restaurants will be located on the 1.6 acre property and will include indoor seating and a beautiful patio area.
"As Baton Rouge continues to grow, we felt the time was right to introduce our Italian restaurant concept to the market. Baton Rouge has been great to us with our Another Broken Egg concept and we are eager to open our fourth Romacelli in Louisiana," said Stuart Ottinger, president of Double D Restaurant Group.
There are currently Romacelli locations in Gonzales, Central, Monroe, and Lake Charles. Romacellil's features a large wine selection, gourmet pizzas, unique pasta dishes, homemade sandwiches, and fresh salads. All Romacelli locations also feature live music in the spring and fall and weekly specials.
Another Broken Egg Cafe offers up Louisiana seafood and many southern-inspired egg dishes with locally-sourced produce. The restaurant also features a full bar and genuine southern hospitality.
"While diners in Baton Rouge are very familiar with the delicious breakfast, brunch, and lunch menu Broken Egg offers, they will love Romacelli's fresh and creative lunch and dinner offerings. As we continue to grow in the region's restaurant landscape, our brand of affordable, upscale, foodie-oriented choices offering top-flight service will be a favorite among Baton Rouge diners," said Ottinger....0 member likes

That Kickstarter ended in early June and resulted in a boxed set containing The Chained Coffin module, a puzzle made of three spinning wheels, a gazetteer, and a couple of extra mini-adventures, and a mid-sized poster map.
There were also numerous stretch goals for this Kickstarter with some extras. These ranged from deals on existing modules, flasks, and more. I just checked and had gone in for the $30 backer level. It turned out to be an outstanding deal for me for the amount of material I received. This should easily be enough for me to base my next DCC campaign in this region.
There have been a few sightings of the boxed set arriving at various places in previous weeks. Mine arrived today! What follows are some unboxing pictures as folks around the Internet wait for theirs to arrive!
Note: I have not included any pictures of the puzzle. I don’t want to spoil that for anybody, so you will have to take my word that it is cool and will be a great table prop! (too bad I will be running this online and not in a face-to-face game.)

We have one in M’s room that says his name in bold and “Child of God” in cursive overlaying that. I made some for family with their last names on it and “established” with the year of their wedding (like, “The Jones Family, est. 1992.”) My brothers-in-law have boards with their school abbreviation and mascot. The ideas are endless!
This is a picture of the first one I made, a Christmas decoration. It’s ridiculously easy to do, I promise!
Materials:
1) Vinyl that reads “Christ”
2) Vinyl that reads “Wisemen still seek Him”
3) Board
4) Paint
5) Credit card
6) Epoxy or other spray adhesive
7) Toothed hook thingy (yah, I’m feeling technical) to hang the finished product
Directions:
First, you order the vinyl. Some stores will also sell you the board (which is how I got mine). If not, you can find smaller boards than this at Michaels; I am not sure where to get one my size. I would recommend the online company where I did mine, but she recently closed down
If you buy your own wood, make sure you give the measurements to the person cutting your vinyl so you can be sure your wording is the right size.
Sand down your board if necessary.
Paint the board (make sure to paint the sides, but it’s not necessary to do the back) as many coats as necessary. While the paint is drying, prep the vinyl. Do this by firmly rubbing a credit card or similar shape of plastic along the back of the vinyl, always in the same direction. This will help the vinyl separate from its paper all in one piece.
Once paint is dry, carefully adhere the vinyl to it. You can use the credit card to smooth out bubbles. Repeat with the 2nd phrase if applicable.
Go outside and spray the board evenly with epoxy glue spray.
Once everything has dried and set, attach your hook to the back of the board. You’re done!
Helpful hint: When using two different lines of vinyl, I highly recommend using the darker color as the bottom line of text.
September 21, 2010 at 8:20 pm
You know, I remember Jenn at Baby Makin{g} Machine doing a vinyl board-type thing for Lil’ J’s nursery. Maybe you can tweet her with the name of the company she worked with. I believe she worked with that vinyl company a few times. Good luck! I love the board. Too cute!

We can learn so much from these types of people. It is so important to teach through action, especially if you have children, or you are a mentor to another person. Each of us have at least one person who looks up to us, who watches how we act and how we treat others, and who tries to emulate us.

“The outsiders come to Lipica from all corners to see this wonder – a green island amidst Karst. How is this possible?”1
The committee [for Karst afforestation in Goriška – Gradiš?ansko] has planted 10,699.550 seedlings in six years (1885 – 1891), from which 6,403.320 in new groves, while 4,296.230 seedlings have been used to fill the previous ones.2
The piece Some leaves, tree needles, and a few fists of earth touches upon the question of the bareness and the almost Sisyphus-like reforestation of the karstic regions. My interest rose a few years ago when someone said to me, the Venetians are to blame ... I am intrigued with the field of relations between images, between truths, between myths, spaces and times. What is a myth, what is real(ity), what is (which) truth and who does it belong to? Which truth does the collective consciousness (write and) accept and how does it change through time? What do you know and believe in?
Reforestation of Karst was broadely implemented in the second half of the nineteenth and continued deep into the twentieth century. With the present state, when around 50% of the Slovenian part Karst is covered in woods, it is almost unfathomable what efforts have accompanied the aforestations. It is hard to imagine that in two hundred years (for forests we presume not such a long time) such a considerable change has indeed occured, a reverse process from (almost, in many parts) rock desert back to wooden areas. But we still say the Karst is bare. And we still like to blame someone for it ... 3, 4

The midterm I missed was only optional (not to be graded, more like a practice MT). also, about the mouse, if you haven’t guessed it yet, yes I got it for free. You ever wonder why Microsoft mouse are so expensive? It’s because they usually have a 5year warranty and will ship a replacement w/o the hassle of you sending it back. I had a Intellimouse w/ Intellieye before, but they realized that was a bad model and discontinued it. Now instead, they upgraded mines to an Intellimouse Optical which has 2 extra buttons. Hehe. ^_^x
Went and got a free jamba juice today @ 9am. The wait time was ~1hr. skipped 4 classes today. Decided to sleep in and then woke up @ 3:30pm. I’m actually proud about what I accomplished today. Went to the dean’s office and found out my faculty advisor. Went to my faculty advisor and got my advisor code (for signing up for classes). Then I went to Physics Lab and completed it in 1hr (1/2 the time allotted). Wow!

Kangaroo
to the Rescue
CANBERRA
- When farmer Leonard Richards was knocked unconscious by a tree branch
during a storm, a kangaroo came to the rescue. Lulu, the family's pet
kangaroo, banged on the door of the family's home until the wife came
outside and followed the marsupial. She discovered her husband lying unconscious
under a tree about 650 feet from the home, guarded by the kangaroo. Richards
was taken to the hospital and was released Sunday night. Lulu has been
nominated for the annual national bravery award from animal welfare group
the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. The family
has been permitted to keep the kangaroo ever since it was little, because
it is blind in one eye and believes it is a dog.

Frosty
the Snowman on World Tour
An inflatable
snowman who was kidnapped from a garden last Christmas has been sending
postcards to its owner from destinations all over the world. The 5ft snowman,
Frosty, went missing from Helen Bevan's garden last year before Christmas.
Since then, Bevan has received postcards from Tenerife, Antigua, Thailand,
Mexico, Malaysia and Hong Kong, all signed with the words 'all my love,
Frosty'. On Christmas Eve, She heard a knock on the door and found Frosty
on her doorstep with a videotape strapped to his body. "Someone had
filmed him having a drink at pubs, playing snooker and shopping in the
local supermarket," Bevan said. Although she doesn't know who the
practical joker is, she suspects that a group of friends are pulling the
prank.

Rent
a Husband in Russia
MOSCOW -
Single women in Russia are now able to rent a "husband" to satisfy
their yearning to have a man around to fix things. Nina Rakhmanina's business
offers a "Husband for an Hour" to women who want a male around
to do the "men's work" in the home. "First, we advertised
as 'home repairs' and got virtually no response," she remarked. "We
changed the name and clients came pouring in." The amount of single
Russian women has greatly increased due to a soaring divorce rate since
the end of communism 11 years ago. About 60 percent of Russian marriages
now end in divorce. Bookings for a rent-a-husband have to be made at least
a day in advance since they are in such high demand.

WEST CHESTER,
PA - On a bittersweet day, Marcus Tian Washington was given an increased
prison sentence and moments later got married to his fiancée Timalin
Douglass. After Judge Paula Francisco Ott added 6 to 23 months to Washington's
prison term for hiding marijuana in his underwear, she then performed
a wedding ceremony for him and Douglass. She asked a deputy sheriff to
uncuff his right hand so she could officiate the marriage. Ott asked the
bride numerous times if she was sure she wanted to proceed with the wedding.
Douglass, who wore a beaded wedding dress, told Ott that she did and later
mentioned she was hopeful about relocating and "getting away from
the wrong people and places." Washington had been caught with marijuana
inside Chester County Prison while waiting for sentencing on separate
charges.

Bras
in the Wind in Detroit
DETROIT -
In a flashy display of undergarments, at least 50 brassieres swayed in
the breeze in a tree over one of Royal Oak's stores on Wednesday. The
street art of cotton and Spandex, in black, pink, beige and white, had
been put together by Noir Leather owner Keith Howarth, who did it as a
gentle reminder to the city of its dead tree outside his door. He said
that his bra display is meant to send a message to City Hall that they
need to replace many dead trees and spruce up the block. Recreation and
public services director Tom Trice said the city would try to inspect
the tree in the next few weeks. Chuck Semchena, Royal Oak City Attorney,
said that the tree must shed its new foliage right away and if it doesn't,
"well take them down -- and we'll charge him."

SYDNEY -
Australian customs officers found eight dangerous snakes, including four
dead king cobras, strapped to the leg of a Swedish man who arrived on
a flight from Thailand. The four king cobras were in containers strapped
to the man's calves and had most likely died in transit. The four living
snakes, believed to be emerald tree boas, had been given to quarantine
authorities and were awaiting to be identified by experts. The man was
charged under Australia's Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Act
and could face a fine or up to 10 years in jail, or both. His motive for
the snake smuggling was not clear, but there is a trade in animals such
as snakes, birds and rare plants, both in and out of Australia.

Phone Case Thrown Out
SYDNEY -
A police car pulled over Dean Crichton as he was traveling on his horse-drawn
carriage about two mph and talking on a mobile phone. Police administered
a breathalyzer test on Crichton for alcohol after they caught him with
a phone in one hand and the reins in the other. Crichton pleaded guilty
and his attorney told the court that he was on a business call and it
was hard to pull over a horse-drawn carriage quickly. The judge threw
out the case, saying the police who brought the charges "look a bit
silly". Magistrate Frank Jones believed Crichton was technically
guilty, but added that he felt a horse and carriage gave the Melbourne
streets character.

Collector Sentenced in Florida
FLORIDA -
The man considered Seminole County's "most annoying neighbor"
was released from jail to clean up his junk-filled yard as he awaits his
November sentencing date. However, Alan Davis hasn't been cleaning, but
just moving some things around. He was seen Tuesday placing more items
from his yard on top of his roof. He told Local 6 News that he will not
get rid of anything from his property until he is told specifically by
the county what needs to be moved. Davis earned a laugh from neighbors
when he relocated his infamous buttocks statue to a different area of
his property. Neighbors have complained about the piles of accumulated
junk and the rats in his yard for over 10 years.

Mr.
Potato Head Stolen in Rhode Island
NEWPORT,
R.I. - A stolen Mr. Potato Head statue was safely returned to its owner,
James Leach, over the weekend. The statue was taken from the driveway
of a private estate and discovered in a field. "Although he was ripped
and mashed a little bit, he is expected to make a full recovery and soon
be on display," Sgt. James Quinn quipped. The 6-feet tall statue
was found within the gates of the 17-acre estate. Leach alerted police
after he heard his driveway alarm about 3 a.m. The stolen statue was originally
sponsored by the governor's office and on display in the Statehouse. Leach
bought the spud as a birthday present for his son. Since then, several
people have visited the statue or stopped to have a picture taken with
it.

Bondage
Club at Iowa Campus
AMES, Iowa
- One of the great things about college life is the amount of diversity
within its student body, course selection and organized clubs. At Iowa
State University, not only can you attend a course on human anatomy in
the afternoon, you can also join a club that allows you to spank those
body parts later on in the evening. Cuffs is a campus club that teaches
students about bondage and other sexual fetishes. The events that take
place at the club's meetings include how-to sessions involving paddles,
leather, ropes and fur-covered "floggers". Though the group
leaders demonstrate different painful ways of getting off, clothes at
the meetings are staying on.

Burglar
Shot While Falling From Ceiling
A woman shot
and killed a man when he fell through the ceiling of her apartment while
she was getting dressed. The intruder was a burglary suspect trying to
avoid arrest by climbing into the crawl space to hide from plainclothes
police at his front door. Police believed that the shooting was justified.
"I think anyone would agree you'd feel your life was in danger when
a burglar falls through your ceiling when you're just getting out of the
shower," police Lt. Tom Monahan said. The woman had purchased the
gun after her apartment was burglarized in April and police think the
man she shot committed that crime.

Set for Eating M&Ms - With Chopsticks
OAKLAND,
Calif. - Oakland resident Jim Hager will soon see his name in the Guinness
Book of World Records after he consumed 115 M&Ms in only three minutes.
However, that wasn't the hard part. He gobbled them up using a pair of
chopsticks. He broke a previous record of 112 Smarties eaten by Kathryn
Ratcliffe in December 2002. For his efforts, he was given 25 pounds of
M&Ms courtesy of a local candy store that sponsored the event. Contestants
had to follow some strict guidelines. They had to use wooden chopsticks,
the M&Ms had to be the standard variety and they had to be brought
to the mouth one at a time in the chopsticks.

Teacher
Throws Out Noisy Students
A Moroccan
teacher found a new way to discipline a couple of noisy students...she
threw them out the window. The schoolboys were hurt when their female
teacher tossed them out of a first floor window after she told them once
to be quiet. She warned the pair she would throw them out, but apparently
they didn't take her threats seriously. One boy, aged nine, was hospitalized
with a fractured shoulder and serious facial and head injuries. The other,
a ten-year-old boy, suffered minor injuries. A government official in
Casablanca said of the situation, "They did not listen. They should
have listened," adding that the teacher "suffers depression."
The official had no comment on whether the teacher would be disciplined.

Flaming
Pooch Sparks Grass Fire
CULDESAC,
Idaho - A dog who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time
had its fur ignited when a vehicle backfired. The canine's fur then started
a grass fire just off U.S. Highway 95. Firefigters doused the grass fire
and reported the dog was uninjured, having only a burnt hair odor. "I
have been in firefighting for many years, but I have never seen anything
like this happen," Culdesac Fire Chief Gary Gilliam said. This happened
Saturday when a driver put gas in the tank and then primed the carburetor.
When restarted, the van backfired, emitting sparks into the cab and igniting
the dog's fur. A passenger let the dog out, and it rolled around in the
dry grass, putting out the flames on its coat but lighting the grass on
fire.

Dropping
the Boys off at the Mannergarten
BERLIN -
German women tired of taking their husbands on weekend shopping trips
can now drop them off at a special kindergarten for men offering beer
and entertainment. "The women are issued a receipt for their partners
when they hand them in and can pick up again when they return it to us
later," Alexander Stein, manager of the 'Nox Bar' said. Each man
receives a name badge upon arrival and for 10 euros ($11.80) they get
two beers, a hot meal, televised football and games. Stein said the idea
for the men's creche, or "Maennergarten," came from a female
customer who felt it would be a good way to get rid of her husband while
she shopped. "It beats sitting around in shoe shops, that's for sure,"
remarked one man.

Six-Legged
Cambodian Cow
Monks in
Cambodia have been blessed with an unusual gift - a cow with six legs.
A farmer donated the rare calf because he feared her extra set of legs
would bring him bad luck. Two-month-old Cham Leck, meaning "Strange"
in the Khmer language, is being taken care of by the monks at the pagoda
near the Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh. The extra legs hang from Cham's
neck. Locals in the very superstitious country are treating the bovine
with some caution. One said, "She looks so calm and peaceful that
after a while you forget she has six legs. Then you raise your head and
see those two extra hooves on the end of these spindly legs coming out
of her neck."

"Didn't recognize you with your clothes on!" The calendar has

It's beyond belief that it could happen but it did," she remarked.
The ice sculptures and the wedding cake all had Star Wars figures and
the music was from the movie score. After sharing their first kiss as
husband and wife, the newlyweds went on their way beneath an arch of lightsabres.

Cannibals
Apologize
SUVA, Fiji
- A former cannibal colony in Fiji has invited the British family of the
last white man they ate to visit for an apology. Local media reported
a remote village on the island of Viti Levu invited the descendants of
the late missionary, the Rev. Thomas Baker, to visit next month. Baker
was killed and cooked by the people of Tui Navatusila July 21, 1867, after
he took a comb out of a chief's hair. One villager who took part in the
feast was quoted in contemporary accounts as saying, "We ate everything
but his boots." Fiji's Prime Minister, Laisenia Qarase, is expected
to attend the traditional apology. Cannibalism died out in Fiji in the
mid-19th century with the introduction of Christianity.

Nazi
Dog Not Amusing
BERLIN -
A man violated Germany's anti-Nazi laws when he taught his dog Adolf how
to give a Hitler salute by raising his right paw. Police investigated
after residents complained they had noticed the man giving the stiff-arm
"Hitler salute" and telling his pooch: "Adolf sit, give
me the salute!" The man ordered his dog to give police the saluted
when they questioned him. Germany has strict laws that ban the use of
Nazi symbols, but the man, Roland Thein, didn't understand what the fuss
was about. Thein showed Adolf's trick to a Reuters photographer in his
backyard after calling the dog from a kennel marked "Adolf."
He welcomed the attention he and his dog were receiving from the media.
He is also accused of shouting the Nazi battle cry "Sieg Heil"
in front of Berlin police and of wearing a "Hitler" T-shirt.

A man has gotten himself into trouble after capering around Provincetown
dressed as a gay lobster. Mark Ceria calls himself "Provincetown's

my art." "People love me," he said after appearing in Orleans
District Court as Mr. Lobster to plead not guilty to pot possession. "The
whole town has opened their arms to me like a superhero." Marijuana
was allegedly found on Ceria last month when he was arrested on a warrant
charging him with stealing an Enterprise rental car. Ceria admitted to
dabbling in drugs and said he was taking the weed to an ailing AIDS patient
while dressed as the lobster. He plans to retire his alter ego by Thanksgiving
and vows that those who would crack down on him will "eat their words."

in on Two-Headed Snake
CENTERTOWN,
Ky. - Until recently, 10-year-old Hunter York was afraid of snakes, that
is, until he discovered one with two heads and could not resist taking
it home. When he found the black king snake, he picked it up with a stick
and observed that it grabbed the stick with both heads. The female snake
hasn't eaten since Hunter found it Oct. 4. Hunter's father, Rodney York,
brought it to snake hobbyist Scott Petty to see if he could get it to
eat. "We couldn't force-feed it, because we don't know which head
eats," York said. Hunter said that he jokingly named the snake Mary-Kate
and Ashley, because those were the first twins' names that came to mind.
"If they're that rare, I'm going to hit up (talk-show hosts David)
Letterman, (Jay) Leno and everybody I can think of," he said. "I'm

OSLO - Doctors

lane to keep them from blocking ambulances. The lane even has pink hearts
painted on the pavement and signs reading: "Kiss and drive - when
you don't want to be in the way". Marit Kvikne, a hospital spokeswoman,
said, "We want to make sure that the kissing is not in the way of
ambulances." The project aims to direct the staff away from the emergency
entrance where ambulances have occasionally been obstructed by passionate
farewells when staff are dropped off. "I don't know of any other
hospital in the world which is doing this," said project manager

STAMFORD,
Conn. - Travis, a 170-pound chimpanzee, is one talented monkey: he can
water flowers, brush his teeth, and even enjoy a game of baseball on TV.
However, one thing he hasn't mastered is knowing when to play. The diaper-wearing
chimp escaped from his owners' vehicle Sunday night, frolicked through
a busy intersection and held police at bay for a few hours. Travis played
in the middle of the street, rolling on his back and occasionally charging
officers. When not shutting doors on squad cars to prevent being trapped
inside, he made runs toward the crowd on all fours. Officers were finally
able to get Travis into his owner's car and held their hands against the
door to keep him inside. Travis was sleeping it off Monday. "He got
up and had breakfast and went back to bed. He's tired," said his
owner, Sandy Herold.

Just a few hours later, she got "a very big shock" when she

said. "They sent me off for an ultrasound, which told them I was
at 37 weeks. The cramping I'd had were contractions." Her husband,
Dennis Ross, had been told he could not father children because of a car
accident a couple years earlier. "He's a good size. It makes you
wonder where I could hide it. My boss was very surprised but not quite

Last Saturday, they held their nuptials there. "We met here, we work

Their wedding was held on the front lawn of the store. Co-workers were
granted a special break to attend the ceremony and they applauded when
the newlyweds kissed. The couple then had their wedding photos taken at
the store's portrait studio. The day did have one difficulty though. "We
lost the rings, and we are still not sure where they are at," said
Bauer. A member of the Wal-Mart family quickly loaned them rings so they

Hole Address not Amusing to Homeowners

England for about 15 months, but they could no longer handle the never-ending
jokes. Groups of teens would often show up for a photo op near the street
sign with their rear ends exposed. They also discovered that taxis and
pizza delivery men would not show up, thinking that their calls were merely
pranks, Allott told the Sun newspaper, "I like a laugh, but it was
beyond a joke." The couple now have a confidential phone number at

the pills from home and brought them to school to share with his friends.
The boys will most likely receive some form of reprimand since the school
has a no drugs policy. The Sun newspaper quoted a source at the school
as commenting: "By the time the afternoon lessons began, there was
no hiding what they had done." The uncomfortable students were taken
to the nearby hospital where they were carefully watched until the drug

Porno
Karaoke Big in Germany
In Germany,
the latest nightlife craze has left bar patrons screaming and moaning
for more. The trend of porno karaoke has spread across major cities in
Germany ever since film producers Satt und Durstig organized a premiere
last month in Berlin. Porno karaoke is not much different than regular
karaoke, except for the fact that instead of belting out tunes from popular
song artists, participants imitate the soundtracks of adult movie stars.
Players pair up into male-female teams while a XXX film is loaded into
the projector. The sound is muted, the duo is handed two microphones,
and for one minute they provide the noises for the on-screen action. The
audience, which usually finds the show more humorous than erotic, then
picks the couple they feel gave the most convincing and enthusiastic performance
of a fake orgasm.

been enjoying a party at his residence when his wife noticed the fish
- a spotted Japanese carp - floating on the surface of the garden pond.
The koi was "acting funny," swimming and jumping before coming
to a dead halt in the water. Worried that the fish had a heart attack,
Van Aert pulled it out of the pond, giving it heart massages before touching
his lips to the fish. "After 15 minutes, the fish started to move
again so I put him in the pond...but when he fell over again I again applied
mouth-to-mouth and heart massages," Van Aert said. "That's when
the fish recovered."

Love
Notes
LONDON -
Singles in England are paying to sit silently while writing courtship
and come-on notes to one another. As many as 35 singles pay $30 each to
sit around tables for two hours exchanging notes and drinking wine at
$6.25 per glass. Organizer Guy Holmes, 28, says the Silent Dating gatherings
are successful because they tune in to the new-found love of e-mail and
text messaging on mobile phones. The guests are mostly career-minded professionals
in their 20s and 30s, with jobs in law, medicine and media. Holmes said
women particularly like the concept, but it's hard to get sufficient men
to round out the numbers. The Mirror reporter who participated said poor
handwriting made deciphering some notes difficult, including one where
a woman wasn't certain if the man asked if she liked wild parties or wild
panties.

YORKSHIRE,
England - A ram proud of his sexual exploits has found a way to inform
British intelligence officials of his routine, the Times of London said
Tuesday. Officials at one of the government intelligence-gathering installations
in northern England's Scarborough region admitted analysts had been puzzled
for months over high-frequency radio transmission being picked up from
a single antenna. More puzzling was the fact it only occurred during daylight
hours. After extensive clandestine observation, the answer was found --
a randy ram who boasted his exploits by grating his horns against the
antenna. Spokesman Bob McNally, said: "It was part of the ritual
that the ram went through after it had made a conquest. I believe the
ram was notching up a mark on the pylon, so to speak."

Six
Brits Snookered by TV Show
LONDON -
Six British men have filed lawsuits against Sky TV for fooling them into
kissing a man that appeared to be a woman. The contestants hoped to win
$17,000 and a week on a yacht with the sultry brunette who starred in
the reality show, "There's Something About Miriam." The young
men say they were told to impress "her" by performing macho
and romantic acts, such as intimate massages, caressing and cuddling,
holding hands and kissing. But they were horrified to learn after three
weeks of filming that Miriam is a man, said to be a planning a sex change.
All six contestants walked out and banded together to sue producers and
try to stop the show being aired. Their lawsuit claims defamation, conspiracy
to commit sexual assault, breach of contract and personal injury by way
of psychological and emotional damage.

LONDON -
An angry 36-year-old father decided to protest over the enforcement of
father's rights to see their children by dressing up as his daughter's
favorite hero Spiderman and barricading himself in a crane over Tower
Bridge. Police were forced to close one of London's main road arteries
to seal off the area around the crane, causing many disgruntled commuters
to lose sympathy for the dad. David Chick left the crane once on Tuesday
to punch the air and walk along the crane's arm. Police felt it was not
safe to remove Chick by force but planned to arrest him. Chick, who has
not been able to see his daughter for over eight months, strolled the
crane on Friday but resisted attempts to talk him down. He had indoor
fireworks in the crane along with enough food to last another week.

MADISON,
Wis. - Two lawyers were caught naked while they were drying off in the
laundry room of a downtown apartment building after the University of
Wisconsin's football victory over Ohio State. David Burleson and Todd
Buss, both 40, told police that their clothes were soaked due to rain
at the game and a building resident told them they could dry off in the
laundry room. The two were charged with disorderly conduct for being "extremely
uncooperative" with police. According to officers, they were "extremely
intoxicated" and singing loudly when the cops arrived. The pair attempted
to cover themselves with a skull cap and a mesh laundry bag. Burleson
and Buss pleaded no contest to disorderly conduct and were fined $200
and court costs.

Advertising
to sell excess breast milk seemed like a good idea to a Salt Lake City
woman, but it created a lot of lactose indignation, a newspaper reports.
An unidentified 23-year-old woman who thought she would help other new
mothers by offering her own excess milk placed an ad in the Salt Lake
Tribune. However, she had to withdraw her offer after receiving one too
many prank phone calls. One man inquired if it came in chocolate while
another wondered if he could buy an endless supply to use as a protein
drink. Health care officials also called to complain about the risk of
breast milk from unknown sources spreading diseases and infections. The
ad offered the frozen milk for sale at $1 an ounce or $350 for the whole
lot. By mutual consent, the woman and the Tribune agreed to pull the ad.

Woman
Finds Condom in Her Chowder
LOS ANGELES
- A woman was enjoying a bowl of clam chowder in a fancy restaurant when
she discovered something that didn't belong in the soup - a condom. Laila
Sultan and her three friends were having a meal when Sultan found the
offending object. "I thought it was calamari or shrimp or something
so I chewed one more," she said. "It felt rubbery. I told my
friends, 'My God, there's something in my mouth.'" She spit the rubber
into a napkin and at first thought it was a latex glove. When her friend
realized what it was, Sultan rushed to the bathroom and threw up everything
she ate. The four women are now suing the restaurant for negligence and
intentional infliction of emotional distress. Patrick Stark, the attorney
for McCormick & Schmicks Seafood Restaurant, said that the staff had
no clue how the condom got into the chowder.

Locks Husband in Bathroom for 3 Years
ISTANBUL
- A man who had been locked naked in the bathroom for three years was
released after his mother, alerted by neighbors, called the police. Orhan
Babutcu, 41, had been locked in the room by his wife, who claimed he was
mentally disturbed. He was found naked and traumatized sitting on the
shower tiles near the toilet, with a bowl of food on the floor. His wife,
Kevser Babutcu, said it was clear her husband was mentally unstable since
he took three showers a day. She was going to request a divorce after
15 years of marriage. "Her goal was to make me sick so that I'd die
and she'd inherit my fortune," her husband said. She had been having
a good time with other men while her spouse was locked away in the bathroom.
He is receiving psychiatric help and she will be charged.

Surfers Hurtled into Parking Lot
CORAL GABLES,
Fla - Two kite surfers were sent hurtling into a parking lot after high
winds lifted them off of the South Florida waters. They flew into a parking
lot at Matheson Hammock Park where one collided with a car and suffered
severe head injuries. He was taken to Ryder Trauma Center. Wind gusts
as high as 35 miles an hour caused waves of up to 11 feet along the coast.
A high surf advisory was issued by the National Weather Service. The wind
came from different weather systems funneling air between them. About
5,000 residents were also left without power in Palm Beach County and
thousands more in Broward and Miami-Dade Counties.

Chopstick
Causes Infection
KUALA LUMPUR,

and was discovered during exploratory surgery to remove an unknown foreign
object. According to Dr. Gurdeep Singh Mann, the patient, Ng Keng Choon,
was lucky to be alive because the chopstick had been leaning against his
brain. Ng had been beaten up five years ago by attackers who stabbed him
with the chopstick. Gurdeep said, "We have checked medical journals
and found out that this could well be the first time in the world where
a chopstick was found inside a patient's face."

Erotic
Petersburg
St. Petersburg,
Russia, is marketing itself as an erotic tourist destination, claiming
it was founded by well-endowed men. Moreover, the city boasts a web of
rivers that resemble a naked woman, according to a new city guide called
"Erotic Petersburg." "St. Petersburg has always been a
pioneer in the country's erotic culture," said Lev Shcheglov, a well-known
St. Petersburg sexologist and editor-in-chief of the guide. "The
city was the first to open a scientific school of sexology, a sexology
center, and even a commission to control erotic products." According
to the guide's authors, visitors to St. Petersburg often experience "a
state of high excitement" conditioned by "the special erotic
atmosphere of the city's architecture." The guide says the first
men to settle the area were famed for their physical attributes, and they
"experienced difficulties horseback riding."

Talking
Trash Cans in Berlin
BERLIN -
Fed up with garbage-strewn streets, Berlin has devised a solution that
it thinks might work - garbage cans that say thank you. Beginning next
spring, the city's trash service will build electronics into some of the
street-side trash cans that will let them speak or sing to the public.
"We want to encourage people in a nice, funny way to throw their
trash in the baskets and not on the street," said the official, Bernd
Mueller. They will be installed at heavily visited areas such as the Reichstag
building. The wastebaskets will be silent after dark, however. "Some
people might feel uncomfortable if these things said something to them
at night," Mueller said. Instead, lights around the basket's opening
will glow green. Mueller did not say how much the talking trash cans would
cost or exactly how many baskets will be programmed.

Relative
Swindle in Japan
TOKYO - Trusting
Japanese have been tricked out of huge amounts of money this year thanks
to frauds who call and pretend to be relatives needing help. Victims of
the swindle receive calls from fraudsters who say, "Hi, it's me,"
and act like they desperately need money for anything from a traffic accident
to an unexpected pregnancy. Victims are quick to believe that the person
on the other end is really a close relative and they usually agree to
transfer money to a bank account specified by the scammer. According to
police statistics, there have been 3,807 reported cases of the fraud this
year and victims have paid out almost 2.3 billion yen ($21.1 million).
A majority of the victims were women over 40. Police recommend that people
check the identity of the person asking for money over the phone.

Convicts
Ask for Tougher Sentences
It's strange
enough for a convict to request a tougher sentence. However, one Danish
judge received requests from two men for extended prison time, and both
ventured to Denmark to get into trouble. When a visiting Scot was given
ten days in jail for entering the country illegally, he asked the judge
for two months behind bars to help him fight his alcoholism. A 65-year-old
Swedish man also requested a jail term to last at least over Christmas
on the same grounds. The Swede, described as having 'zero personal hygiene,'
has been legally banned from traveling to Denmark, but has visited there
at least 100 times since the prohibition. He was sentenced to 40 days
for illegal entry, and once released and sent to Malmo, he returned on
the first boat to Denmark. Neither man was given a longer sentence.

Attacked by Elf

A visit to see Santa at a shopping center ended in disaster for 13-year-old
Joakim Osland. A fjoesnisse, a type of elf that normally lives in barns
and wears a red cap associated with Christmas and Santa Claus, became
incredibly angry when Joakim tried to pet his hen. Osland and two friends
went to see the fjoesnisse, who was standing with a wagon containing a
pig and a hen. A curious Joakim wanted to pet the hen that he thought
looked incredibly soft. When he tried to touch her, she hopped away, provoking
the 'elf' to go berserk. "He came up behind me and shouted at me.
I didn't think elves did that kind of thing," Osland said. "He
grabbed me, first with one hand, then the other, so that he was strangling
me. He said I should respect animals. The elf scared me a bit."

Cross Stitching
DALLAS -
Thanks to an angry woman in Dallas, needlepointing has just gotten a little
sharper. Julie Jackson runs subversivecrossstitch.com, a website that
provides needlepoint kits for those who are mad as hell. Jackson started
the site a year ago after working for a hellish boss and taking up needlepoint
as therapy. However, instead of stitching up nice little messages such
as "God Bless Our Home," she chose sayings like "Candy
Ass, What Makes You Think I Care?" and "Go F*** Yourself."
She has found the needlepoint kits to be extremely popular, particularly
with gloomy teenagers. Only one person criticized the kits and thought
the patterns were bad. But Jackson feels that a person stitching up "Go
F*** Yourself" isn't going to be too concerned about the intricacies
of cross stitching.

Santa Causes Bomb Scare

to tie the chocolate to the Christmas tree for wiring. Before the bomb
squad could blow up the chocolate Santa, the person who sent it was traced
and put an end to the scare by revealing what was inside. One police officer
said that the X-ray machine picked up the gold string and it looked like
wiring. Everyone had a laugh when the package was opened and the chocolate
Santa fell out. An employee remarked that all of the staff were jumpy

Bonus for Air Canada Employees

Employees graced with the award were sent a personal letter containing
the coupon, redeemable until Dec. 31 at the Harvey's hamburger chain,
Second Cup coffee shops or other restaurant outlet owned by Cara Operations
Ltd. Since the coupons soon expire, they came at no cost to the carrier.
Some Air Canada employees had to forgo a bonus earlier this year when
the airline won court protection from its creditors and extracted about
$840,000 worth of concessions from its unions.

Indian
Holy Man Hasn't Eaten in Decades
AHMEDABAB,
India - Physicians are reportedly baffled by an Indian holy man who claims
not to have eaten or drunk anything for decades, but who is in perfect
health. Prahlad Jani, who is over 70 years old, was placed under constant
observation for 10 days in an Indian hospital. The hospital's deputy superintendent,
Dr. Dinesh Desai, said the holy man -- or fakir -- did not consume anything
and "neither did he pass urine or stool," yet he remained in
good mental and physical condition. Physicians say most people can live
without food for several weeks, but the average human can survive for
only three to four days without water. Jani spent his 10 days in the hospital
within a specially prepared room with a sealed toilet and under constant
video surveillance.

Nearly Buried by Turkey

- A brush turkey thought he had met his match when a man fell into a mating
hole in a Burleigh park and was almost buried alive. The man was walking
along a track when he fell into the 'hole of love' and was buried up to
his head. It is thought that a brush turkey discovered the man shortly
after he fell and attempted to bury him in a mating ritual. The man was
stuck in the hole for awhile until someone noticed him and called emergency
services. Several fire crews came to the scene and fought back laughter
as they retrieved him from the hole. A wildlife ranger said that December
was the frisky season for brush turkeys. Just last week signs warning
people of wild turkeys were put up in the national park.

Woman Explodes Gas Station

store at 5 a.m. and wanted to buy beer or wine, the Miami Herald reports.
The clerk refused because city and county ordinances prohibit the sale
of alcohol before 6 a.m. The woman left, but once in her car she raced
it backward, striking the gas pump, which exploded and erupted into flames.

Christmas
Carols as Terrorism
Christmas
carols are a form of terrorism? Well, according to an Austrian union that
represents store workers, the answer is yes. The union believes the constant
playing of Christmas tunes is a type of "psycho-terrorism" that
can cause workers to suffer psychologically. In fact, Gotfried Rieser,
of the Union of Private Employees, is requesting that stores only play
carols a few hours a day and restrict them to departments that sell Christmas
presents. He claims that employees "get aggressions and aversions
against Christmas music" when exposed to it for long periods of time.
Stores employers' spokesman Franz Penz says CD players allow stores to
play a large number of songs. "It practically doesn't happen that
the same Christmas tune is played over and over again," he says.

hitting her with his fists, according to the report.
He then went
to the bathroom and allegedly returned wielding a 3-foot alligator, swinging
it at the woman. He hit her arm with the reptile as she tried to escape.
He then allegedly threw empty beer bottles at her and finally shoved her
out the front door of the house, according to the report.
The woman
went to a neighbors house to call for help.
Havenner is charged with battery and possession of an alligator, both
misdemeanor offences.
Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission authorities were called
out to the house to handle the illegal reptile.
Havenner was transported to the Volusia County Branch Jail in Daytona

Vermont
Wants to Secede
CHARLOTTE,
Vt. - Vermont may no longer be part of the United States if a small group
of citizens has its way. The Second Vermont Republic is attempting to
get the state's 600,000 residents to agree to secession to avoid what
leader Thomas Naylor calls "imperial overstretch" and "corporate
homogenization." Naylor says that the state is a rural area that
has nothing in common with large cities such as Chicago or Los Angeles.
He believes that separating from the Union is the only way to be sure
the "Green Mountain State" stays green. Naylor hopes the secession
will be non-violent and insists that his goal is just to free Vermont
from the other 49 states. The Second Vermont Republic only has a few hundred
members at the moment but Naylor is sure that his plan will be successful.
He is also hoping to convince New Hampshire, Maine and Quebec to join
them in forming a new country.

that says "Round yon" on the outside and "virgin"

session where she and Leone and a few friends came up with the goofiest
sayings they would like to see printed on underwear. The panty greetings
aren't just limited to Christmas - you can pick one up for bachelorette
parties, birthdays and even a divorce card that says "Yay you're

Alarming
Assault Ends in Arrest
NARA, Japan

assault on a neighbor with blasting radios and alarm clocks, police said.
Kayoko Deguchi, 47, was arrested for inflicting bodily injury after her
noisy alleged assault left her 53-year-old neighbor with chronic headaches.
Relations between Deguchi and her neighbor had been strained for some
time. Police said on almost every day from February to September this
year, Deguchi had placed radios with the volume at the maximum level next
to windows facing her neighbor's home and let them play. She also set
off a series of alarm clocks to heighten the noise, creating chronic headaches
for the neighbor. Some days, the radio would be left on from dawn to dusk.
Police visited Deguchi's home several times, but she refused to respond.
Police raided Deguchi's home twice up until Dec. 3, seizing six radios
or radio cassette recorders and nine alarm clocks.

tank tops with buffalo wings. Not only do the girls look good cutting
hair, but Gurule reassures customers that they really are good at cutting

Want Cash With That?
WESTON, Fla.

Janice Meissner ordered a bagel and a Diet Coke for breakfast, but her
bag of food seemed unusually heavy. She soon discovered the bag was loaded
with hundreds, maybe thousands, of dollars in a sealed plastic bag. The
money turned out to be the restaurant's bank deposit. Officials for McDonald's
said the deposit was put in a food bag to make it less obvious before
it was taken to the bank. It was accidentally left too close to the drive-thru
window and the employee didn't check twice before sending it out the window.
Meissner did a double take after opening the bag before backing up her
minivan to the window to return the money. McDonald's officials said they
will send Meissner a thank-you letter and $50 in gift certificates.

Very Lucky Cat
ROCHESTER
HILLS - Mich. - Tracker the cat is one lucky feline. After traveling 150
miles in the engine of a car, he emerged a little shaken, but otherwise
unscathed. The long-haired gray cat rode unseen in the engine compartment
of a female college student's car as she drove home for the holidays.
He most likely survived the 150 mile-trip in the Chevrolet Tracker because
the woman made no stops. She only noticed the cat when she reached home
and heard intense kitty-crying. After she and her family searched around
the car, they finally lifted the hood and discovered Tracker perched on
top of the engine. Officials at Pontiac's Michigan Animal Rescue League
believe the cat probably slipped into the engine compartment to keep warm.
He is currently residing at the League and is waiting to be adopted.

Diapers to Power Bremen

and believes he has found it - used diapers. "It's an environmentally

incinerator plant that made a deal with a nearby retirement home to purchase
100 tons of used pads and soiled tissues, which is an average of about
10,000 pads. "The pollution emissions with used pads are far lower
than with oil or coal," added Lesche. "The content of nappies
provide a great source of energy. The demand for used incontinence materials
will grow in the future." He also mentioned that the materials make
up around one percent of the plant's energy output now, but felt confident
that the percentage would increase.

No
Job if You Have More Than 3 Earrings
ORLANDO,
Fla. - If you have more than three earrings in each ear, don't expect
to get a job in any Orange County office. Administrators have decided
that three earrings in each earlobe is the maximum amount of "facial
jewelry" that workers will be allowed to wear in Orange County offices.
Any other facial piercings, such as eyebrow rings, nose rings, or tongue
studs, will not be permitted. "They can't even speak well when they
have their tongues pierced," said Commissioner Mary I. Johnson, 70.
The earring policy also states that none of the three earrings can be
worn on the top part of the ear. The only holdout among administrators

BOSTON -
A man in Boston has taken on some ballsy acting roles - ones where his
testicles do the work. The man, who refers to himself as "Sackie
Gleason," has a website called testicletheater.com, where he dresses
his testicles up in costumes and has them act out scenes from "Macbeth,
Enter The Dragon" and "Thelma and Louise." Gleason agrees
it's a little nutty but believes his "multi-talented testicles"
bring the works of Stanley Kubrick, John Cassvettes and Sam Peckinpah
to a new audience. Gleason doesn't want to keep his testicles confined
to a film set. He enjoys the live stage and admits his testes thrive during
"live theatrical interpretations on request."

Grow 'em Tough in Arkansas
HARRISON,
Ark. - After a farmer's arm was ripped off in a tractor accident, he picked
up the limb, climbed back on the tractor and went home to get help. "What
was I supposed to do? Lie there and die?" James Arlen Mondy's wife
quoted him as saying. Doctors tried but were unable to reattach his arm
after the Dec. 16 accident. Mondy was knocked off his tractor when it
hit a hole and the spinning blades of a brush cutter chopped off his arm
at the shoulder. As he made his way home, he stopped to open a gate, drove
through, and then dismounted the tractor again to close the gate. He continued
on his way and began to feel lightheaded. Luckily, a passing couple saw
him and were able to summon help.

Diamond Ring?
CLEARWATER,
Florida - A woman who swallowed a 1.5 carat diamond ring had no choice
but to give up the evidence when nature called, Florida police reported.
A Clearwater Police Department spokesman said that 38-year-old Mary Flowers
was arrested last week after she was caught on surveillance tape swallowing
the $20,000 ring at a jewelry store in a mall. She denied digesting the
ring until an X-ray revealed that it was inside her. She was held in a
jail cell under observation until she passed the ring through her digestive
system on Monday. Flowers was charged with grand theft and bail was set
at $5,000. Police are keeping the ring until the case is over.

After Royal
Olympic Cruises claimed bankruptcy and lost its navigational equipment
to creditors, about 800 cruise ship passengers are now stranded in the
Caribbean on the company's cruise ship, the Olympia Voyager. The ship
is anchored in St. Thomas and will "not be going anywhere anytime
soon." Creditors allegedly stopped the cruise ship on its voyage
and repossessed computers and navigational equipment. The report featured
John Haskell, a possible future passenger, who had bought cruise tickets
with the company to tour the Amazon River. "I'm disappointed that
this happened, Haskell said. "I was looking forward to this cruise.
It was going to come to around $5000 for the two of us. It was a good
bargain."

What
Jobless Problem?
BERLIN -
Germany has quietly accelerated an old tool in its fight against chronic
unemployment -- coax the unemployed into not looking for work. Under the
plan, run by Germany's Federal Labor Office, a jobless person signs a
document saying he or she no longer seeks work and, in exchange for thus
helping lower the country's double-digit unemployment rate, gets unemployment
benefits until their pension kicks in. While the government denies it
is accelerating the program, a source said officials recently sent a memo
to the country's job centers setting a goal of 75 percent of all unemployed
over 58 to sign on. Despite the denials, there has been a sudden rise
in participation. Since September, 373,100 workers have signed the document,
up 20 percent from the year earlier figure. Analysts expect the number
of jobless to top five million this winter.

CORONA, Calif.
- In an attempt to fight pornography, Pastor Craig Gross - who runs an
anti-porn website called xxxchurch.com - has created the world's first
anti-porn TV commercial. The 30-second commercial details the adventures
of a midget named Eddie with the moral being "porn stunts growth."
Although it isn't politically correct, Gross says that these days even
the Lord must use the "Jackass" mentality to get His message
across to the young men most likely to become addicted to porn. Gross
insists that he asked Eddie for his input before filming and the midget
said he had done more degrading things. The anti-porn ad has run in Southern
California on shows like "Howard Stern" and "The Man Show."
Gross hopes that anti-porn advocates will pay to have it air in other
areas of the U.S.

Trapped
Under a Mountain of Books
A book-loving
pack rat tried to squeeze even more tomes into his tiny New York City
apartment and ended up buried under an avalanche of books, magazines and
other stuff. "I was hollering for two days, 'Let me out! Let me out!'"
Patrice Moore tells the New York Post. The 42-year-old former mail room
clerk was trapped under his possessions for two days. His screaming finally
alerted the landlord but despite breaking the door down, the avalanche
kept rescuers from opening the door. Even after the landlord removed the
door from its hinges it took three hours to dig out the man. Moore says
he collects books and magazines and peddles them back on the street for
about $300 a week.

Getting
a Leg Up
SANTA FE,
N.M. - A couple returned home from a week-long vacation to an unpleasant
surprise: the legs of a dead man dangling from their ceiling. Police identified
the man as Carl Smith, 81, and he was the ex-husband of the woman who
lived in the home. "He was stuck in an air conditioner duct,"
said Trish Ahrensfield, a spokeswoman for the Albuquerque police. Police
said it seems the man was attempting to break into the home via the roof
and died while trying to enter through the air conditioner duct. The couple
said their house was cold when they returned and they went to the bathroom
to check if the heater had been turned off. When they looked at the ceiling,
they saw the legs hanging down.

MONTREAL
- A Montreal housecat beat out former pro players and sports analysts
in the Montreal Gazette's NFL pool, the newspaper reported Friday. Miss
Kallie, an 11-year-old brown tabby outwitted 11 humans, including radio
and television sports broadcasters, two Gazette sportswriters and two
former professional football players, to win the pool, which appeared
weekly in the newspaper's sports section. Miss Kallie's winning record:
101 wins, 82 losses and nine ties. Her average was .552. Before each game,
her owners would hold up slips of paper bearing the names of the competing
teams. They would encourage the cat to sniff one of the pieces of paper.
Her owners found her to be very species-loyal, often picking the Bengals,
Lions, Jaguars and Panthers. She also frequently demonstrated an interest
in possible sources of food: the Ravens, Seahawks and Eagles.

Record label: Wax Poetics
Genre(s): R&B, Retro-Soul, Alternative R&B
In 2002—and for six years following—Verve Records released a series of compilations entitled Verve Remixed, consisting of electro remixes of songs made famous by Billie Holiday, Nina Simone, James Brown, and the like. The remixes seemed like a tawdry way of getting a younger generation to listen to founding figures of blues and soul, and ultimately reduced these modifications of classic cuts to shopping mall muzak. When it comes to encouraging impressionable listeners to seek out past greats, Adrian Younge has taken a more effective path: Rather than remastering or remixing a classic artist’s greatest hits, he’s instead sought out that artist and has worked with them in creating a new and surprising release.
Aficionados of sophisticated, sweet and sensual soul music need no introduction to William Hart. He's the leader and prominent songwriter of legendary trio the Delfonics (originally featuring his brother, Wilbert, and the late Randy Cain as well), which helped put Philadelphia on the map as a soul music capitol in the late '60s and early '70s, with a string of classics like "Didn't I (Blow Your Mind This Time)" and "La-La-Means I Love You. " While even the babies conceived to those luxurious grooves are pushing midlife at this point, Hart's voice has aged like fine wine on his collaboration with multi-instrumentalist/producer Adrian Younge.'s almost 20 years since Rick Rubin successfully repositioned Johnny Cash from a fading star in a terminally uncool genre into the walking embodiment of cool with American Recordings. In the interim, the late-career Rubin-style makeover has become just as much of a cliche as the album of standards from the American songbook. A release about a new collaboration between the Delfonics' William Hart, and Adrian Younge, a producer several decades his junior, said that the resulting album was going to be "what the kids call 'hip-hop'"-- which sounds a lot like an unappealing welcome to the rap game Rubin-Cash formula.
An inveterate crate digger with a distinctly off-beat sensibility, Adrian Younge has quickly defined himself as a unique reimaginer of old sounds, finding new life in the dusty world of soul samples and ‘70s vinyl fetishism. First was his dead-on soundtrack for the blaxpoitation spoof Black Dynamite, providing embellished funk backings that matched the film’s obsessive visual specificity. With Something About April, he established his Prince-style abilities as a multi-instrumentalist, figuratively remixing the sound of an era while literally remixing himself, transforming an album recorded years prior under the name Venice Dawn.
This isn’t your father’s Delfonics. The version he might remember was rooted in Philly soul’s sweeping string arrangements and a young William Hart crooning in his sweet falsetto on hits like “(La-La) Means I Love You” and “Didn’t I (Blow Your Mind This Time).” Now in his 80s, Hart isn’t the same man (or voice) he used to be, but he still has plenty to say, and producer Adrian Younge is the ideal choice to take dictation. Guided by Younge’s grittier sound, an older, wiser Hart explores rawer emotions: “Stand Up” is a funky rebuke of social apathy, ominous “Enemies” bristles with paranoia, and tender “Lover’s Melody” doesn’t disguise its sexual undercurrent.Uticaica College zoology courses, for example, you may gain an advantage in job recruiting on-campus.

Chinese Newcomers Service Center (CNSC) was established in the summer of 1969 by the International Institute of San Francisco in collaboration with Chinatown North Beach community leaders. CNSC’s first home was a one-room office located on the fourth floor of a Grant Avenue building (above a bank), operating under the able leadership of Ms. Marie-Louise Ansak, who was a social worker with the International Institute. The initial funding was provided by the United Bay Area Crusade (United Way), the Van Loben Sels Foundation, and the San Francisco Department of Social Services.
The landmark 1965 U.S. Immigration Law expanded the quota of China-born immigrants to 20,000 per year, leading to the needs of Chinese immigrants and refugees, who began to arrive in large numbers in the San Francisco Bay Area, being largely unmet. At that time, not many community agencies were serving the San Francisco Chinatown residents, and city-wide agencies were limited in their ability to serve non-English speaking clients. The founders of CNSC meant for it to be a
one-stop information/referral agency that could meet most of the needs of a non-English speaking family arriving to this new country. The goal for each newcomer was: first, acculturation; then integration; and finally, citizenship. CNSC continues to provide transitional guidance while empowering immigrants to become self-supporting and contributing members of society..

Press release from the issuing company
TORONTO, – Avanti Computer Systems Limited, a leading provider of Print MIS and Web-to-Print solutions has, for the fourth year in a row, been recognized at Graph Expo as part of the "Must See Ems" technology and product recognition awards program, the highlight feature of the Executive Outlook Conference. This year, Avanti received "Must See 'ems" awards for CRM Automated Lead Management, Automated Proof Tracking and Avanti-Ultimate Impostrip Integration, all of which were demonstrated at the show.Graph Expo's most compelling products and services are selected for recognition by an international panel of 19 leading industry consultants, analysts, educators, and editors. Chosen from over 1,800 products that were featured at the show this year, Avanti's three product announcements received "Must See 'ems" awards in the MIS (Management Information Systems) category. "We are very excited to have been recognized this year for three Must See 'em's," says Patrick Bolan, President and CEO of Avanti. "Digital Printing, Automation, and Web-to-Print were identified as critical technologies at the Executive Outlook Conference, so it is of no surprise that our new services, focused on automation and integration, were recognized and awarded by the committee. As more printers are looking for ways to manage their business for long-term sustainability and success, automation is becoming key to achieving that success."Must See 'ems:1) Avanti CRM Automated Lead Management:Avanti CRM Automated Lead Management is an API (Application Programming Interface) developed to automatically send lead information from a printer's main website, third party site or micro-site, directly into Avanti CRM, in the Print MIS system. Information about visitors to the website automatically creates a new contact and follow-up activity in a sales rep's 'Leads' tab in CRM (where sales reps manage their funnel) completely automating the web-leads management process.2) Avanti Automated Proof Tracking:Avanti's Automated Proof Tracking is a web service developed to streamline the proofing process. This API facilitates bi-directional communication between Avanti's Print MIS and the printer's third party web interface. When a proof is available for viewing, an email trigger is sent from Avanti's Print MIS to the client, letting them know that the proof is ready for their review, with a link to the proof. Once opened, the status of the proof (accepted, rejected or pending, including a time-stamp and name of the person who signed off on it) is sent back to the CSR and the Proof Approval milestone is automatically updated on the job and on Avanti's Electronic Scheduling Board. 3) Avanti-Ultimate Impostrip IntegrationAvanti's Print MIS is completely integrated with Ultimate Technographic's Impostrip OnDemand imposition software. This integration partnership allows printers to achieve zero-touch workflows from "web-to-print-to-finish". When a job is submitted across the web by the customer, the job is automatically created in Avanti Print MIS. Important job parameters are sent by Avanti directly to Ultimate's XML Director, where the imposition is created. Once imposition is completed, XML Director automatically sends the press-ready PDF to the selected press for printing. At the same time, a JDF job ticket is produced and the job parameters are sent to the selected finishing device which is automatically set up with finishingNEWS: Phil Campbell’s All Starr Band, The King Is Blind and Witchsorrow confirmed for Bloodstock 2016!

So I did it!
I went WAAAAY out of my comfort zone and recorded my average singing (at best!) on video for all of the listeners out there. I mean I’m terrified any time I get in front of the camera – I start sweating profusely (always pitting out my shirt (how lady like!)) and I get cotton mouth and panic a bit. What you see when you see me on the screen is usually after about a thousands takes, some serious editing and a near divorce each time between my husband and I as I freak out over making a video.
BUT I wanted to walk my talk and show my commitment to Tiffany and Danna and those thyroid warriors out there who are making commitments to themselves to make nourishing changes and choices to improve their health. I am willing to do almost anything to support the health of those ready to make a real change.
What I didn’t expect was how much fun I’d have making this video.
It was liberating! And, it felt great on my body and my mind. I started breathing again and felt elated and energized when I had finished (even though I’d already had a very long and exhausting day).
So, I decided, I want you all to experience that too! I mean singing helps your thyroid in a few interesting ways. First, by vibrating the vocal chords, you’re actually internally massaging the thyroid. When your vocal chords vibrate, it stimulates your thyroid to release thyroxine, a critical hormone that sets the cell metabolic rate.
And to give you a little “practical woo woo” as I like to call it, thyroid disease is considered in ancient medicine to be an energetic disorder of the 5th Chakra (or throat chakra as its known). And, spiritually speaking, that Chakra gets out of balance when we keep quiet and don’t use our voice — literally and figuratively. When we stuff our emotions, bite our tongues, hide our voice, often that energy gets blocked in the throat (our seat of communication) and manifests itself as a thyroid imbalance.
So, what’s the remedy for that? It’s to let your voice be heard!!! Join me every week as I sing my thyroid healthy and share it here for a weekly Thyroid Sing Party!
(Want to help lead the party – send me a video of you singing along to your favorite song via dropbox at getTLC @ thyroidlovingcare.com and I’ll post it here for everyone to jam to…come join the party today!)Find Personal Injury Attorneys and Accident Lawyers in Rolesville,.

Since coming to trust Jesus Christ, Jason has been propelled by a passion to tell others of the true joy, hope, and peace he’s come to know in Jesus. This passion for the gospel led him from street preaching into serving full time for 8 years as a Student Ministries Pastor in Toronto, working with urban youth in a multicultural setting. While serving there, Jason was educated at Heritage College and Seminary, and ordained in 2011 with the Fellowship of Evangelical Baptist Churches in Canada.
Convinced that the church is God’s vehicle for blessing the world, Jason’s goal is to lead the church in living out their identity as the saved and sent people of God. Simone, his wife, keeps him young and fun, while working one of the hardest jobs in the world as a full time mom to their 3 young children, Elise, Ethan and Isaac. All God’s gracious gifts! When Jason is not helping others know and follow Christ, he is known to enjoy a good movie, live theater, roughhousing with his children on the floor, jogging, working on his pull ups, and making his wife laugh at his buffoonery.[vc_row][vc_column width=”3/4″][cq_vc_tabs tabsstyle=”style2″ tabstitle=”Home,Competition,Judging Criteria,Rules & Regulation,Contact,Club Reg.” iconsupport=”yes” tabsicon=”fa-university,fa-trophy,fa-check-square-o ,fa-bullhorn,fa-phone,fa-wpforms ” rotatetabs=”5″][tabitem]
Edutainment is the routine of learning through a medium that both educates and entertains using any of various media, such as animation, computer games, courseware, mobile application or still television. The aim of the UTM Edutainment project is to blend teaching and entertainment elements (edutainment) so that a learning session is fun and entertaining. These way students increase their receptiveness and learn more effectively at any level of our educational system.
The Edutainment product will be developed by student to facilitate other students in scholarship. It can be applied either as peer learning strategy, learning aids during class or even self-learning. It will make a newfangled style of determining where scholars can grow their creativity skills. In order to promote students develop the Edutainment materials, this project used competition as the main strategy.
Student to Student – Edutainment conducted at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia is a project under New Academia Task Force.

LITTLE ROCK, Arkansas, SEPT. 27, 2007 (Zenit.org).- Six women religious were excommunicated in Arkansas for their involvement in the schismatic association Army of Mary, based in Quebec. The diocesan newspaper The Arkansas Catholic said that it is believed to be the first time anyone in the Diocese of Little Rock has been formally excommunicated. "It is a painfully historic moment in this Church," Monsignor Gaston Hebert, the diocesan administrator, said Wednesday at a press conference in Little Rock. The Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith issued a declaration of excommunication Sept. 12 for those associated with the Community of the Lady of All Nations. The association's founder, Marie-Paul Giguere, says she believes that she is the reincarnation of the Virgin Mary. The Vatican's doctrinal congregation said in the statement that the group's "particular teachings are false and its activities are not able to be frequented nor supported by Catholics." Of the 10 religious sisters of the Monastery of Our Lady of Charity and Refuge in Hot Springs, eight are members of the Army of Mary. After receiving the Vatican's declaration regarding the Army of Mary, Monsignor Hebert invited the women religious to reconsider their membership in the organization. He returned to the monastery Wednesday and accepted the decision of six of them to leave full communion with the Church. The monsignor said two of the eight members are living in a nursing home and could not "knowingly and deliberately" choose to remain with the Army of Mary. The remaining two sisters, who had never been associated with the schismatic group, will be moving to another convent, the diocesan administrator said. He added that the women religious, who own their convent, will remain on the premises, although it will no longer be recognized by the diocese, nor should it receive the financial support of the laity. Church officials removed the Eucharist from the monastery Tuesday night. "They will no longer have any sacraments," Monsignor Hebert said. Although those excommunicated cannot receive Communion, they are encouraged to attend Mass, he said. The order of Our Lady of Charity and Refuge began in France in 1641. Its convent in Hot Springs was founded in 1908 by five French-Canadian sisters.Eat your vegetables they are good for you. How often have you heard that? I bet ever since you were a child, and I bet you’re now telling your children the same. We all know that vegetables are good for us, it’s been drilled into us our entire lives.
But when you’re trying to lose weight you want to minimize the calories as much as you can. Now all veg are good for you and provides their own source of nutrients that benefits your health in some way or the other. So you should never consider cutting any of them out before speaking to your doctor.
But if you’re trying to cut back on calories, maybe you could eat more of the non starchyveg as appose to the starchy veg. Vegetables come in two categories and the non starchy has less calories.
Taken from livestrong.com here are some nonstarchy veg that you can include in your diet to aid your weight loss
6 Nonstarchy Vegetables To Help You Lose Weight
Broccoli
You can enjoy broccoli in a couple of different ways while losing weight. Blanch it, chill it and have it with a fat-free dressing as an afternoon snack, or steam it in the microwave and include it as part of your entree. Not only is broccoli low in calories, 25 calories per 1/2-cup cooked portion, but it also contains lutein and zeaxanthin. You need these carotenoids to keep your eyes healthy and prevent age-related eye problems.
Spinach
Spinach is one of several nonstarchy vegetables you can include in your diet, without feeling guilty. A 1-cup serving of raw spinach leaves provides approximately 10 calories and 0.7 grams of fiber. You need plenty of fiber in your weight loss plan, since it takes awhile to pass through your digestive tract, keeping you feeling full for hours. Make sure you consume 14 grams of fiber for every 1,000 calories in your diet, advises the Linus Pauling Institute.
Eggplant
Eggplant is a rich and hearty vegetable that will leave you satisfied after every meal. A 3 1/2-ounce portion of grilled eggplant has about 35 calories and 2.5 grams of fiber. Eggplant is also naturally rich in folate, a B vitamin that aids in absorbing and metabolizing protein from the foods you eat.
Salad Greens
Salad greens, like romaine, iceberg and Boston lettuce, are considered “free foods,” the American Dietetic Association explains. Free foods are highly beneficial for your diet plan, because they offer less than 20 calories and fewer than 5 grams of carbs per 1 cup serving.
Tomatoes
Tomatoes are a delicious guilt-free addition to your salad, sandwich or grilled kebob. Each 1 cup-portion of cherry tomatoes has around 25 calories, 2 grams of protein and nearly 2 grams of fiber. Additionally, tomatoes are rich in lycopene, a carotenoid that is beneficial for cancer prevention, says the Linus Pauling Institute.
Baby Carrots
Snacking on baby carrots in the middle of the afternoon can help curb your appetite until dinner. Enjoying 1 cup of baby carrots provides a minimal 25 calories and 2 g of protein. They are also a quick way to add 2.5 grams of fiber into your diet. An additional benefit of carrots to your weight loss regimen: they’re rich in beta-carotene, another carotenoid that keeps your eyes working their best. See the entire list here.
So don’t stop eating your vegetables, they’re beneficial in more ways than one, not just for weight loss.
Lately I’ve been eating a lot of spinach, I can’t get enough of the stuff. Only yesterday I added half a bag of it to my chicken pasta dish, it’s so easy and versatile and can be added to most meals. Eat it raw in a salad or throw a couple of handful into your cooked meals it’s that simple.

We went to a pumpkin carving party yesterday where we got that part of the Halloween season out of our systems, so when we went to Washington Farms today, we posed with pumpkins but came home with none. The kids had a great time - thanks Aunt Kristi and Uncle David for helping to keep them wrangled! - and we brought home more than a little dust and dried corn kernels to dump into the bath, along with the little ones.
First, here is Michael 'helping' to hang some of our Halloween decorations.

Creative arts and communications studies graduates earned less than those who studied economics and medicine; women earned less than men and graduates from richer backgrounds earned more than those from poorer. LSE, Oxford and Cambridge produced the highest earners. All highly puzzling. The conclusion was drawn that it is sometimes not worth going to university at all, and that the £9000 pa tuition fee may be wasted. Some critics thought that there were too many universities and young people should give serious consideration to whether they should go to university or straight into the labour market.
I have just returned from a large reunion in N. America of Oxford graduates, including many of my own former pupils and contemporaries. So I am in reflective mood about what a university education does for you. My personal experience is Oxford but close friends and family graduated elsewhere. I emphasise two points that are at odds with the purely commercial assessment made by the Institute of Fiscal Studies. One is that a university education is not all about earnings later in life – far from it. In many ways earnings are the last factor to consider, albeit that now one has to borrow £9000 to attend, whereas in my time tuition was free and the number of undergraduates was tiny. It is a lifechanging, life enhancing experience, a chance to try out various disciplines, think about ambitions, careers, sample sports, travel, debate and, above all, make friends with fellow students and lecturers. Second, the graduates who go on to make the most money seem to be the ones with flair, persistence, personality and vision, not necessarily the ones with the best degree results. (Not that I would have said this to my students facing exams at the time.) So, yes, it is well worth it, even at £9000 a year: otherwise you will spend the rest of your life wondering what you missed and also realising what you missed.
There is a much greater “field” within which your topic is set,
fresh grounding reading for which would include
“Mindset” (Caroline Dweck) –
(“) One needs to minimise one’s “Fixed”-mindset; and be always optimising one’s [much neglected] “Growth” mindset …
[which, having read some of the new “Degrowth” economics, I have to call the “Flexible” mindset, or I’m ‘treacherously’ uncomfortable}.
“Perceptual Self-Control” theory (WT Powers et al) – “Easy to comprehend and begin doing;
and much more all-round satisfying and ‘ecolonomical’,
less ego-inflating one side,
and less punitively-demeaning the other,
than the chronicly-entrenched “Reinforcement” theory.
Other neglected leading work exists, for instance :-
“Earning” [versus] “being Paid” (or “bought”/ “bribed”)
“Sustainworthiness” –
(i) “One human being needs only one-human-living”
by which thinking-highway can be seen that the less one consumes and destroys the more sustainworthy one is, both shortest-term and longest-term
(“sustainworthiness” including purely-material ‘economic’ and ‘fiscal’ sustainability of the individual and of her/his environment too);
(ii) Instantiation:- Hitler’s Third Reich m ight have been “sustainable” for a thousand years; our problem with it was that it was not “sustainworthy” —–
Now, looking at where our Civilisation is now heading
“down the insidious-slippery-slope of overkill and under-lifesupportgiveness into highly-probable self-and other-lifeforms-extinction”
to my eyes this is a much worse “non-sustainworthy” civilisation than that Hitlerian one.
(iii) “evidently” the Rich are the most ‘consumerly’ destructive

Please note that there are a vast number of components and methods out there and each O&P practitioner and/or lab have their own recipe for success, so what you are about to read is not the only way it's done or the "end all beat all", it's just the way we do it at my particular practice. In this field there are many ways to skin the proverbial cat and all that matters is patient care and satisfaction.
The goal of this instructable is to give a glimpse into what we as O&P technicians do to give patients their lives back as best as possible. Even most patients have no idea of the work involved in making their new limb.
I work at a small O&P company in Sacramento. We are lucky to have our own in-house lab which allows us to meet patient needs in a matter of days as opposed to conventional practices forced send out all their work resulting in a 3 week average wait for a patient.
I'm entering this in the Full Spectrum Laser contest, we can do a lot of good things for our patients with the prizes so please vote!
Step 1: Initial Stages of a Leg: the Diagnostic Socket.
The first step in getting a new leg is to be evaluated by your doctor, given a prescription for a prosthesis, then make an appointment with a Prosthetist.
Your prosthetist will need to provide you with a temporary socket to go over your limb. This is used to give your new leg a "test run" so to speak.
Your Prosthetist will first take a cast of your residual limb and hand it off to his or her technician, we technicians fill it with plaster to form a "positive" mold. From that a diagnostic socket (or check socket) is formed from a clear PETG plastic that we bake in an infra-red oven. In the industry this plastic is also commonly called Vivak.
Your practitioner can then use this to test fit a socket to your residual limb. They can also attach components to allow you to stand and walk in it, the plastic's clarity and low melting point allow your practitioner to see where you're feeling pressure and use a torch or heat gun (not while you're wearing it of course) to gently soften the plastic and relieve the areas of pressure. Foam padding can also be added to the interior of this socket if needed.
At the time you have your residual limb cast the practitioner will discuss with you what methods to use in holding you in your new leg.
These methods are typically:
Suction: A one way expulsion valve installed into your socket allows air to be pushed out when inserting your limb, but does not let air back in and holds you in place.
Vacuum: Similar to suction but a pump of some sort sucks air out while you wear your leg creating a negative atmosphere holding you in your socket. This pump can be a piston style device that continuously draws atmosphere as you walk/step and substitutes your pylon (the pipe that makes your leg longer). The vacuum can also be provided by an electronic, removable pump if so desired.
Pin System: You wear a silicone liner over your residual limb which has a serrated pin at the distal (bottom) end that clicks into a lock bolted into the bottom of your socket.
The method chosen will decide what, if any, modifications will need to be made to your positive mold prior to pulling plastic, to make your diagnostic socket. Once the best fit is attained, the socket returns to the lab to begin making your definitive!
Step 2: The Definitive Begins: Single Stage Lamination
After your prosthetist makes the necessary modifications to your diagnostic socket, it returns to the lab and we begin to fabricate your definitive socket.
For pin systems and suction systems we do a single stage lamination. This means our fabric layup goes on all at once and resin is poured only once to finish the socket. We do a single stage lam for suction sockets using a three prong adapter with a plastic liner, but I'll show that in the next step.
We use a variety of fabrics in our layup. They are:
Nylon Stocking: These provide a smoother interior and exterior texture post lamination, we use them as the first and last layers for this reason.
Nyglass Stocking: This fabric is a blend of nylon and fiberglass. It isn't as structurally rigid as conventional fiberglass is, but it is light, stretches well and provides good structure when used in combination with other materials.
Spectracarb: This is a composite fabric of carbon fiber and spectra, this stuff is so tough you can't cut it with scissors and it dulls utility knives in an instant. Because of its toughness it serves as the "backbone" of our layup and makes up the middle layers. For more info on spectra check out this link.
Carbon Fiber: This one requires no introduction. It is light weight and strong, enough said. We will sometimes use carbon fiber exclusively, and other times use it as the interior and exterior of a socket with spectracarb in the middle for added structure. For our purposes, the fiber is tubular rather than in a sheet. The weave is similar to a Chinese finger trap and allows for a snug layup and reflection.
The materials are almost always the same but the quantities of said materials will vary based on a patient's weight and activity level. The more materials used and the more resin involved to laminate it, the more sturdy the socket will be, but it will be heavier and vice versa. Ideally we aim for a finished thickness of about 3/16" with the socket as light and strong as possible.
Step 3: Definitive Socket: Two Stage Lamination.
Two stage laminations are required for vacuum and suction suspension systems.
This means we first pull a thin vivak liner over the positive cast to offer a smooth interior which helps to draw and maintain vacuum/suction. It only takes a scratch the width of a hair to compromise these systems so we take extra care to ensure the plaster mold is baby smooth before pulling the plastic liner. The smoothness of the plastic interior when finished guarantees the sockets success.
After the liner is pulled we place it in the lamination station, sand the surface, and do a layup of just nylon and nyglass and in some cases two layers of spectracarb. Suction sockets normally only require a single stage lamination, but can sometimes require two.
Resin is poured with some pigment and left to cure for about an hour or two. The curing process gives off a lot of heat and it can be sanded as soon as it becomes cool to the touch. We never cut out a socket unless it has cured for at least 8 hours, sanding and grinding at this stage are still safe however.
This initial layup allows for a solid platform to affix a plate to allow an interface for the vacuum system and the rest of the components to complete the leg.
Once the plate is epoxied to the socket we sometimes use bondo to blend it in to the overall shape of the leg, otherwise we simply just proceed with the secondary fabric layup. The plate has a groove around its circumference which allows us to tie it off to reflect it instead of twisting it.
If the patient brings us a cool T-shirt to laminate to the exterior of their socket it gets prepared and stretched on as the last layer prior to pouring resin.
I donated my treasured instructables shirt for this how-to. It's for a good cause and now it's immortalized! Hopefully I'll win another one.
Step 4: Assembly: Finishing Your Leg
After the socket is finished your prosthetist or their technicians will attach the necessary components to complete your leg. These components will be pyramids and various adapters for those pyramids, pylons (pipes made of titanium or aluminum) to make your leg long enough, any vacuum or pin systems to hold you in your leg, a foot that suits your activity level to afford you the best quality of life, and a foot shell for cosmetic aesthetics and to fill the inner space of a shoe.
The following pictures show a rough breakdown of the assembly including a foot shell.
There are many components available, much more than I'm showing. Each selection is chosen on a case by case basis, this field is truly all about custom work. Good O&P practitioners really try to go above and beyond to help their patients and don't quit until you are comfortable. Amputees and their practitioners should form a good working relationship, we strive to earn patients for life and we technicians see work for the same patients cross our paths constantly. This is great because while we techs don't always get introduced to the patients, we get the satisfaction of knowing our patients trust us to return for care and they're satisfied with the work that we do.
Being a patient loyal to a practitioner is vastly different from being a patient of a family doctor. Amputees will see their prosthetist twice a year at the least. Some patients see their prostheitst a few times a week if they are a new amputee, or if their bodies change in a way that doesn't allow them to fit into their socket (think weight gain, loss, or discomfort), and of course malfunctions.
It's a lot like having a mechanic you keep going back to because you really like them and you know does good honest work.
Step 5: Final Notes and Details Not Mentioned.
Come and pay us a visit!
I hope you all enjoyed my instructable shedding some light into a lesser known aspect of the medical field. This is a great profession if you want to make a career out of being a maker, every day is different and demands clever thinking and use of materials you have on hand. It is extremely fun and rewarding to do, it rarely feels like a job.
I am a dbtk amputee. I am very handy and workshop orientated. Do you think these instructions would be enough information and tips to make my own sockets since I could not afford them from a medical institution? I have to get around walking on my knees and it starts to wear me out so fast.
hi, I'm missing half a leg as well and their damn expensive considering the price of the materials involved. The market price around here is about 6000 euros. Perhaps that's justified by the work hours involved, but the thing is I don't have a job, and therefore on the up-side I've got lot's of time, so I'm converting it back into money so to speak. I'm walking on a prosthesis I got in 1998 and it's kinda falling apart. So I'm looking into repairing it (something that is out of the question with the prosthetists), and making a new one. I can't offer a tutorial since I haven't completed anything yet, but we can exchange thoughts if you'd like.
Hi, i have also lost my leg and am wanting to manufacture my own socket due to the rediculous pricing in the medical field. I have a number of ideas on how to accomplish this but id like to talk to other people for more information.
I'm very sorry to hear that.
Unfortunately I haven't provided enough information or tips for someone untrained to make their own sockets. This was only a rough outline of what's involved in the process, we work closely with practitioners as a team to fine tune any details. If done incorrectly or with the wrong materials, serious health issues or injury could result.
I'd recommend calling around to your local O&P shops and see if they offer free consultations. They will be able to tell you about any financial strategies you may not know of.
Cheers and good luck to you.
Pat
Now if you win cause I voted for you I get to fly on out and have you 3-D print me a NEW LEG right????
My prosthetist doesn't believe me when I say that this IS the way all of these things will be done in the future. In fact I see a day not that far off where our actual biological LEGS will be 3-D printed---new meaning to "I Made It At Tech Shop"!!!!
I have seen some of the steps used in making legs--my guy is very good at showing this stuff---but some I had not seen. Very interesting. Am going to have my guy look this over---might be useful to new or even older amps.
AS to K-Levels---the ins co's like to "downgrade" them and keep you at a lower level as it is generally much cheaper; but then you can't move on. I am not using Cheetah legs and never will but a basic foot was causing me to NOT be able to use ramps etc. I had two valved ankles that FAILED--I won't mention the Co here--and now have one (from a different maker) that works and I can do more.
Now if we could only get this socket fine tuned! It's an all day deal to go see my "Leg Guy" as it is an hour drive one way and at least an hour or more visit. I love him but---I know it frustrates him as well when we can't get things in order.
I do find the whole argument that "Socialized Medicine" is WRONG to be a bit odd when you consider that here in the USA we have to FIGHT to even GET a prothesis==I know I did!---and yet in England they are "entitled" to three faux legs--a work leg a sport leg and a dress leg. Now if I am wrong on this you Brits please let me know!!!!!
And if anyone knows WHERE to donate old but very useable leg pieces and bits--please let me know!!!!
After my leg was amp'ed our ins co balked at getting me a prosthetic---they approved the amp but apparently had NO plans on getting me walking again. My husband works for a Home Improvement Store and went to the plumbing aisle and got several plungers and took them to the Managers Office and showed them to some visiting VIP's and asked--Which one do you think I should buy for my wife? Gee funny but we DID get approval after that---
Thanks for posting. It is fascinating to see how prosthetic legs are made. I have to admit, though, that it doesn't look as difficult as I thought it would be. I'm not saying it looks easy, but that it is fairly strait forward. About how long does it take to complete the entire process?
Awesome write up! I have a neighbor that lost his leg and we have spent a lot of time together discussing prosthetics. It's a fascinating field to say the least.
Thanks!
The field is super cool and interesting.
Why is there a sign of rust and dirt in the feet? or am I wrong?
I used extra parts lying around the shop to demonstrate. None of the hardware or components are brand new. By law every patient gets brand new componentry when they get a new leg.
Thanks! Btw, congratulations for your excellent instructable. I already voted for yours.
Cheers.
I'm glad you enjoyed it, and thank you for the vote!
Awesome tutorial; The vivak sheet part look fun!
We have a parrot at the sanctuary who came to us with a severed leg from a fight with another bird, I would like to set it up with a prosthetic in the future... I've been playing with some ideas and a friend on facebook was helping me with a gear mechanism that would help it grasp [allowing it to be mobile and perhaps one day climb along its perch again.]
Thank you again for this tutorial, ill reference it in the future. :)
That's awesome, I hope it works well for the parrot!
Great instructable! Very informative!
Hi Pat Have heard on the BBC about the possibilities for 3D printing bringing prosthetics to those who need them in unfortunate parts of the world. As someone who wears stilts at work at least once a week for 40 years, and a compulsive tinkerer, I am interested in adapting some of the techniques for prosthetics to a better fitting more ergonomic stilt. Any ideas? I don't have a 3D printer or much of a workshop, but I bet there is some market for retrofitting stilts for construction workers, though I suppose the costs through accredited prosthetic shops would be too much for a non-medical need
I'm not familiar with stilts or how you wear them, but I would suggest looking intoorthotics. If they strap to your legs then that would be the better avenue to research.
Thank you, will do
Oh thank you so much for posting this! I'm looking at going into prosthetics for a career. I've been researching the field but everything written has been very vague so it's nice to see something this detailed. I'm voting for you so good luck and thanks again for the post!!
Oops, it's
Thanks for the vote!
Where have you been running into trouble finding info? Email me if I can help.
The ABC is the governing certification body for the field, and NCOPE is the one that governs education accreditation.
what program do they have?
ps i voted also! can't imagine why anyone who knows how hard it i for amputees would not vote for you. i am a vietnam vet who volunteers at a va hosp.
Thanks for the vote!
In Spokane? It's a 2 year prosthetics tech certification program at a junior college which is pretty standard from what I've read. The web site for the National Commission on Orthotic and Prosthetic Education (NCOPE) will have a list of programs in the US, they are the accrediting body for the O&P industry.
Awesome I didn't think you could just work and then test.
What was your day to day work flow like where you worked ?
Thank you for the vote!
If you go on to they have all the academic requirements for various certifications, Tech is the only one you are able to work at as a job and become certified.
I currently work at the practice where I volunteered. Day to day work flow, and patient traffic vary like any other business that produces a product and has customers.
We do prosthetic and orthotic work for outside O&P entities who lack a central fab as well as work for our own patients. We also do braces and prosthetics for pets (which is rare). Where I work and Ortho Pets in Colorado are the only two places that do this kind of work.
I pretty much have my hands in all kinds of work (Orthotics, Prosthetics, and pets) so I keep pretty busy. There will be many other instructables I plan to publish covering examples of that work!
Hey pat where did you go to school to be a prosthetic tech?
Do you know anything about Spokane falls community college program?
Also take a look at hugh herr on Ted.com he has a really good Ted talk about where prosthetics are headed.
I've seen his TED talk, it's pretty great.
You can either do a two year program at an accredited college to become tech certified, or you can work under a certified technician for two years, test, and be certified. I've got another year of work ahead of me before I'm test eligible.
I really don't know much about Spokane's program. I was looking into it while I was volunteering at the place I now work at. They hired me, so I decided not to go to Washington :P
@RAVIDOW---
There is a guy on ebay selling what he claims are plans to help you make your own prosthetics--I have looked at his listing but have not purchased his instructions. I cannot endorse what he might be offering but might be a thought to take a look.
As a BK I have wondered HOW and WHO made the early prosthetics aka "Wooden legs" and in some ways the tech has not changed that much---ie a "basic" leg is still a piece of something that goes between your lag and the ground. HOW you accomplish that has changed a lot but if you have nothing--then anything would be helpful.
I know I asked what to do with my older non-fitting to me legs and I know the techs cannot take the parts back even if they were useful to others or brand new. I know others do sell them on ebay (I have seen these for sale and know people who have purchased them and used them) and I have heard of medical missions who take donations and use them for others. Google might be your friend on this. But the best thing would to at least have the help and advice of a tech who knows what can and can't be used for you and of course the socket would need to be made for you. The other parts might be able to be re-used for you. I would also check with your local Red Cross/Red Crescent/Red Star health organization to see if they can help you.
Good luck! PS--the older legs I think were actually wood with padded leather "socket" and straps that went around your leg and or waist to hold the item on---might be worth looking into. Think Peter Stuyvesant or Benedict Arnold era.
PPS---Did you know--there is a STATUE Monument dedicated to a LEG? Yes Benedict Arnold was not a traitor when he fought at the Battle OF Saratoga and lost his leg---when it came time to make the statues for the park the sculptor was told to ignore Arnold but he did not--he made a statue of his LEG and it is still there---I just visited it last week!
i'm a Physical Therapist. Unfortunately, prosthetics haven't caught on in my country (some patients actually refuse them, because they are being treated as "freaks") Thank you for this information.
I'm curious to know where you're from.
Philippines. I work in Manila. There's two hospitals here that do prosthetics (the veterans' hospital and one pediatric hospital), plus one private company. That's about it, and even there most of their output is on orthotics rather than prosthesis.
I know nothing of prosthics but I found this instructable awhile back...
I dont think it will work on legs but it might give you some ideas.
That's neat! 4Kg is only about 9 pounds though, so not really safe for lower extremities. Very cool trick.

In case you aren’t knowledgeable, YouTube contains a income sharing function, a lot more than 1 billion customers uploading more than an approximated five hundred several hours of video to the site each individual
three) Complete the video description with a minimum of 2 – 3 paragraphs of text. This is a crucial action that a lot of people neglect. YouTube would like to know what your video is about and also the video description part could be the best method to validate this.
What’s much more astonishing is leaping the road doesn’t constantly rely on fantastic video information! In fact I’ve observed one million awesome videos attracting hardly any views. Contemplating YouTube receives a hundred Several hours of recent uploads just about every MINUTE!, possibly The point that some get observed and a few don’t isn’t that mystifying In fact.
Even so, I’m obtaining that that offers other troubles (some not always original site current in my file-program organization); for one particular, this can change the Title from the Post so significantly as to be unnecessarily perplexing or oblique; at times that search phrase is nearly The entire Title; and many others.

Depends on which stats are used
By MATTHEW M. BURKE AND TRAVIS J. TRITTEN | STARS AND STRIPES Published: July 10, 2012
SASEBO NAVAL BASE, Japan — The U.S. Defense Department says the MV-22B Osprey is safe. Residents of Okinawa, where 24 of the tilt-rotor aircraft are to be deployed soon, strongly disagree, with the prefectural governor threatening a movement to close all U.S. military bases on the Japanese island if their concerns are not addressed.
Who is right or wrong might not be so black and white. It all depends on which statistics are used to assess the safety record of the helicopter-plane hybrid that has been combat tested in Iraq and Afghanistan. The key is whether recent high-profile crashes are included in the safety calculations, and if those calculations are even valid.
The Japanese government released a Marine Corps environmental review of the Osprey’s proposed deployment on June 14, a day after the U.S. Air Force reported that one of its Ospreys flipped over on a Florida base, injuring the crew. Safety statistics in the report indicated that the aircraft are slightly safer than the aging CH-46E Sea Knights, which the Ospreys are replacing.
That was true until a deadly Osprey crash in Morocco in April claimed the lives of two Marines and inflamed Japanese concerns over the aircraft’s safety. But that crash was not factored into the Marine Corps environmental review released by the Japanese government, because the Corps had finalized the report prior to the crash.
Factor in those two additional crashes, and on paper, statistics would indicate that the Osprey is less safe than the Sea Knight. Updated statistics that include the Morocco crash were provided to Japanese officials in an addendum to the environmental review, Japanese government and Marine Corps officials said.
But the Marine Corps says those figures aren’t as bad as they appear.
“The numbers don’t tell the story of the bird,” Marine Corps spokesman Capt. Richard Ulsh said. “It’s a safe aircraft.”
The safety figures are based on the number of Class A mishaps per 100,000 flight hours. Class A mishaps involve repair costs for the aircraft or government property exceeding $2 million or the death or permanent disability of a servicemember.
In the review given to the Japanese government, the Osprey was listed as having a slightly better safety record than the Vietnam-era Sea Knights — 1.12 Class A mishaps per 100,000 flight hours, compared with 1.14 for the Sea Knight.
Responding to a Stars and Stripes query, Marine Corps headquarters released the updated set of statistics that included the Morocco crash. As a result, the Osprey mishap rating almost doubled, to 1.93 Class A mishaps per 100,000 flight hours.
Ulsh said that the Osprey has proved itself in continuous combat missions over the past five years, and that the safety numbers are overly skewed by the crash in Morocco.
The statistics spike when an aircraft with low flight hours has a Class A mishap, Ulsh said. In the last 10 years, the Sea Knight has more than 480,000 flight hours compared with 115,000 for the Osprey since 2007. So a crash or two wouldn’t have the same impact on the Sea Knight’s record as they would for the Osprey.
“In five years of operational flight, the MV-22 has only had two Class A mishaps; the most recent one taking place in Morocco in April of this year,” Ulsh said. “Given the fact that the past five years include continuous combat missions in Iraq and Afghanistan, this relatively low number of mishaps is considered a testament to the aircraft’s safety and survivability.”
Richard Whittle, former Washington and Pentagon correspondent for The Dallas Morning News and author of “The Dream Machine: The Untold History of the Notorious V-22 Osprey,” said the Osprey has a bad reputation due to the crash record of the pre-2001 version of the aircraft, which was “designed, prototyped and tested with inadequate funds because of the politics of defense acquisition.”
Whittle, who covered the Osprey off and on for 22 years, said that ensuing crashes marred the Osprey’s reputation. It was later redesigned and retested, but the damage was already done.
“Judged by Class A mishaps per 100,000 flight hours, the Sea Knight has a slightly better statistical average than the Osprey at the moment, but that’s because the CH-46 has been flying since Elvis Presley was King,” Whittle said. “Many more Sea Knights than Ospreys have crashed over the years … Today, there is no safer rotorcraft being flown by the U.S. military, in my view.”
Yet Okinawans, spooked by the recent crashes, strongly object to the planned deployment. The prefectural government and various cities on the island have passed resolutions opposing the Osprey deployment. About 5,000 Okinawans showed up at a protest rally last month in Ginowan City, home to the long-embattled Marine Corps Air Station Futenma, which is to house the Ospreys.
The local opposition is animated by still-sharp memories of the 2004 crash of a Sea Stallion helicopter on the campus of Okinawa International University, which sits adjacent to Futenma.
In that incident, the Sea Stallion’s tail rotor and a section of the tail rotor pylon detached from the aircraft. The rotor blades struck the university and the helicopter crashed and burst into flames. No civilians were hurt and the crew survived the crash, which was blamed on shoddy maintenance, but it prompted impassioned protests calling for the closure of Futenma, located in the middle of a densely-populated urban area.
The charred walls of a building struck by the helicopter were left standing in the middle of the university campus, as both a memorial and constant reminder of the crash.
“While it has long been said that Ospreys are defective aircraft, recent crashes like the one in Morocco and in Florida once again proved it,” said Seishin Hanasaki, 73, who attended the rally with his wife and neighbors.
“It’s very scary to think that such an accident-prone airplane will fly over our skies,” said his wife, Hatsuyo Hanasaki, 70.
Atsushi Sakima, mayor of Ginowan and an organizer of the event, agreed.
“To protect the lives and property of citizens, I call for immediate cancellation of the deployment of Osprey to Okinawa,” he told the rally.
More protests followed a few weeks later, when Japanese Minister of Defense Satoshi Morimoto visited Okinawa Gov. Hirokazu Nakaima to explain the host nation notification the U.S. government issued to Japan regarding the impending deployment of the Ospreys.
“We are yet to be convinced of the safety of the aircraft,” Nakaima said during the half-hour meeting.
Morimoto stopped short of discussing the government’s stance on the Osprey.
“What is clear is that the United States is continuing flight operations of the aircraft despite the accidents,” he said, adding Japan would reserve opinions until final reports on the crashes are released. “We are not in a situation at this moment to make any decision.”
Morimoto was on a two-day tour of Okinawa and Yamaguchi, host community of Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni, where the aircraft will originally land in late July for system checks before moving on to Futenma.
Yamaguchi Gov. Sekinari Nii has expressed opposition to the deployment plans, as has Mayor Yoshihiko Fukuda of Iwakuni, where the Ospreys would fly two or three times a month to refuel.
There are also concerns in Sasebo, home to Sasebo Naval Base and ships of the U.S. Navy’s 7th Fleet. The amphibious assault ship USS Bonhomme Richard deployed there recently with upgrades to carry the Osprey.
Officials in Iwakuni said the Japanese government will not be able to proceed without public support.
The U.S. government announced two weeks ago that in recognition of Japanese safety concerns, the Ospreys will be grounded until the final crash investigations are provided to Japan. The Japanese Ministry of Defense has said it will set up a team to independently evaluate the Ospreys’ safety.
“If the deployment takes place by brushing aside concerned voices of the people of Okinawa, it will inevitably lead to a prefectural-wide movement to demand immediate closure of all the military bases on the island,” Nakaima said.
Ulsh said the Sea Knights are old and must be replaced. The Department of Defense has touted the Ospreys’ versatility, which includes the humanitarian arena. But the Japanese must live with the aircraft. And it isn’t just an Okinawan issue. Their increased range allows for more flights over mainland Japan, Ulsh said. He is confident the Osprey will serve safely, but he says there are no alternatives to the planned deployment.
“There isn’t another answer,” he said. “It’s important for us to have the Okinawan people think this is a safe aircraft.”

There are some "innovations" in our system which you may find rather unique.
Administration staff use computers in a typical business environment, users have their own or a preferred workplace and use programs in a repetitive way. There is limited tinkering with configuration, the staff have a form of ownership of their computers and software, there is an implicit "duty of care" and claim to unique usage. In laboratories, classrooms and, to a lesser extent the library, the situation does not resemble business style use. There is in general no ownership of a particular place or computer, users change often, levels of expertise and purposes for use vary with each person. There is no guarantee that the previous user has left the computer in a stable or familiar mode. Personalising a computer is fruitless as it may be undone by the next user and probably raise the ire of technical staff. In this environment, problems associated with the operation of the facilities are not owned by any user and quickly escalate as students are wont to tinker with configurations and experiment, this manifests itself as herds of would be hackers stampeding through the network, maddened by the latest fad or feature.
Anecdotal support for the difference in usage between administration and classroom comes from the ubiquitous look of perplexed terror on the faces of would be consultants whose business world view is suddenly cast into sharp relief as a serene eddy when confronted with the chaotic tides in which student users prowl. The latter environment is a learning environment and although sometimes the learning is more "self directed" than I would like, it is preferable that experimenting and tinkering be allowed, (yeh even unto the configuration of the operating system), than forbidden by technical guile or policy. There needs to be some element of self preservation and predictability for the hard pressed staff, but wherever practical users should be given a free reign.
To summarise: The reason for having a policy is to provide guidelines based on expediency and experience to provide a relatively stable and happy learning environment for users and administrators. Our policy should allow and suggest rather than forbid, and where it forbids, penalties and reasons should be given, the emphasis being self discipline. The policy should contain only what is necessary, as with any legal document, be reviewed frequently and made known to all concerned.

In 'Oswiu: King of Kings', Edoardo Albert brings to vivid life the battle for the land and souls of the British people in the seventh century. Albert tells an epic tale of kings and queens, omens and shieldwalls, where the future of a people was decided as much through the guile of its priests as the strength of its warlords.
Edoardo Albert deftly weaves the threads of a memorable cast of characters into the weft and warp of a vibrant tapestry of war, mystery and intrigue. Yet the true strength of 'Oswiu: King of Kings', is in the depiction of the effects of conflict on the men and women of the Dark Ages, as Albert reminds us there is much more to conquest than the ringing clash of swords.

“Don’t change your code unless you know how it will fix your problem”. If I had to pick a quote to put a ‘squiggly line and my name’ next to, then this would be it.
I’ve seen developers stare blankly at an exception message, comment out a line of code or two and then try and run their code again hoping for the best.
This, of course, rarely fixes anything. Quite often the line of the error message has little to do with the actual problem. Instead, this introduces new errors into your code and causes the problem to take longer to resolve.
Even if you guess and make an exception message go away you still don’t know what caused the error to begin with. Instead, you have a new error that is quietly causing problems and is now much harder to find. They might be ugly, but exception messages are the easiest errors to fix… well, after compiler errors that is…
So, how can you “know” your change will fix the problem? Here are some of the recommendations I make to other developers.
Stop and Think… Carefully
The bug isn’t going anywhere and each time you guess incorrectly you add a new error to your code.
It seems like such a silly thing to even mention, but I’ve seen plenty of developers take a cursory glance at an exception message and then just start changing stuff. It doesn’t even matter if you’re in a “break-fix” situation – you should always carefully consider the problem before changing your code.
Read the error, start following up the stack and think about what could cause this result. Think about the conditions that would cause the error or how you could force the error to happen again.
If you don’t know why your change will fix the code then you aren’t fixing anything.
Understand the Debugger
You don’t need to know what a memory dump is for or how read binary manually to use debugger. Just simply understanding how to set break points and stepping into, over and out of code will probably cover 99% of the problems you encounter.
It might seem daunting at first but don’t ignore the debugger because logging or message boxes are easier to write. Once you get a hang of it, the debugger will most likely become the greatest tool in your future bug squashing adventures.
Isolate and Resolve the Specific Problem
It can be difficult at times to figure out why a section of code doesn’t work when it sits in the middle of a larger application. Sometimes its better to create an empty project and work with a smaller section of the program by itself.
For example, if you don’t understand how a part of your framework is supposed to behave, pull it into a separate program, for example a console application, and work with it until you are comfortable with the results. Then when you integrate your changes back into the main project you can be confident that any remaining errors aren’t part of the newly introduced code.
Look At Open Source Code
If you’ve written some code that is consistently causing problems then consider looking for a framework or open source project instead.
This isn’t a matter of being a good or bad developer. It certainly has nothing to do with being unable to figure out the problem for yourself. Quite simply, code that consistently has errors is probably a difficult problem.
Public frameworks and open source projects are typically owned by other developers that understand the problem better than others. They have taken the time to abstract away the specifics of a problem and build a clean API for other developers to use.
These developers are also typically eager to improve their code and will listen to feedback. Even if you don’t use their project there’s a good chance that you will learn something by simply reading their code.
To sum it up, don’t just change code and hope for the best. Stop, think, ask yourself how does this fix the problem?.
How do you approach fixing problems in your code?
Good post. In school I helped people try and work through writing their class projects. Honestly most of their ‘problems’ came from the fact that they really just didn’t know how to debug and work out their bugs. No one writes bug-less code the first time, so this is a critical skill. A skill that I think is poorly represented in formal education, and it shows in more than a couple of the people I’ve worked with beyond college.

Thanks Mike,
I agree that the debugger ought to be one of the first things that instructors should be teaching their students, but unfortunately, in my experience, the debugger is never even mentioned. I can’t think as to why unless the instructor themselves either thinks it causes students to think through problems more carefully or that they themselves haven’t used it much either.

For over sixty years, the Indiana Council for Economic Education (ICEE) has been creating teaching resources that let teachers do just that for basic economics principles. Economics is part of our everyday lives. Regardless of how intimidating it can be, we think every student should be financially literate.

The direct consequences are increased extinction rates. Food webs, which are networks of predator-prey interactions, provide a basic understanding of ecosystems and therefore help to identify reasonable conservation strategies.
In this thesis, I analyze evolutionary metacommunities, which can be modeled as evolutionary networks of networks: The outer networks represent fragmented landscapes of several habitats. The inner networks describe localized food webs on these habitats. New species emerge as modifications of existing species and population dynamics determines how the species interact and which species are viable. Additionally, species are able to migrate between the habitats. In contrast to previous studies that focus either on evolutionary or on spatial aspects, I include both and investigate the interplay between them.
I use two different evolutionary food web models to describe the local dynamics. The first model was introduced by Loeuille and Loreau in 2005 [1]. It characterizes a species by its average adult body mass, which is the only evolving trait. The resulting networks show a regular pattern and are remarkably stable. My analysis of several model variants reveals that a model has to fulfill two conditions to provide more realistic network structures: It should allow for the evolution of more traits in addition to body mass and it should restrict each evolving trait to realistic boundaries.
Based on these results, I introduce a new model. It is less abstract than earlier models of this type in the sense that all evolving traits have a clear biological meaning. The species are characterized by their average adult body mass, their preferred prey body mass, and the width of their potential prey body mass spectrum. The resulting networks cover a wide range of sizes and structures and show
a high similarity to natural food webs. They exhibit a continuous species turnover. However, massive extinction waves that affect more than 50% of the network are not observed, suggesting that corresponding events in earth’s history had external
causes.
Metacommunities built with the model by Loeuille and Loreau show several results that are already known from non-evolving metacommunity studies. In comparison, metacommunities built with the new model show a much broader range of phenomena. By varying migration strength, migration type and spatial topology,
I demonstrate that the combination of evolution and dispersal affects the structure and stability of food webs differently than each of them alone. The understanding of the interplay between evolution and dispersal leads to new insights into the factors that stabilize ecosystems despite changes in the spatial environment or the
species composition.

When you wish to decorate a party, or add some interesting features at pub tables, you can use empty beer bottles and a pair of flames. Follow this simple tutorial to understand what I mean.
Step 1: Cut the Bottle
With an empty beer bottle you can make much more than trash it! If you don't believe me make a fast search on instructable! Indeed you can build beautiful tables or strange lamps. In most cases you have to drink the beer and cut the empty bottle. That is not difficult... to drink the beer, cutting it is a bit more complicated!
To do that you can follow my instructable or another one on the site.
Step 2: The Lamp Plug
Find a black lamp plug. I used one for little E14 bulbs, which fits in the little bottle very well. If you had drunk a bigger beer you can use a common E27 plug.
Step 3: Connecting Wire
Connect the wire to the plug's screws, and tight them hard, since they will keep the lamp hung to the ceiling.
Step 4: Flame Bulbs
I bought some beautiful flicker flame bulbs. Those run at 120 or 220 V and consume very low current. They really appear as a flame and people will be attracted by that beautiful effect.
The only question is hot to avoid the flame in the bottle to stay upside-down... all the same it's nice to see.
Step 5: Light the Fire
Now you can hung up the beer bottle, turn on the light, and light a candle in the bottom of the bottle. In that way you have two particular gadgets from a single piece of garbage.
Very neat cut! Did you use hot-cold water or an open flame for getting it to split?
in the video he shows him using a glass cutter
I must have missed something here, but I checked two of Andrea's 'ibles on topic and could find no video. The one you posted in your other comment is about an entirely different method, so could you post the link here? there you go!
I used both methods, you have to be very careful with both, very patient and make it with no hurry. If you use the flame start keeping the bottle enough far from it. I didn't make any video for now.
Hi andrea
very good idea indeed
Before this instructable I was cutting my bottles by hand with a lot of failure.....
Great invention !!
Yours Aeon Junophor
Veeeeeeeery nice idea, I really like those candle holders!
Beautiful! Have you also tried to invert the bulb inside the bottle (or both)? I think it would be nice to see different versions of it.
And I love that flame bulb, I must get it sooner or later!
ps: sbaglio o ti stai facendo fuori delle gran birre ultimamente?? haha :D (scherzo!)
Flame bulbs are common and much cheaper now during Halloween
I'm not sure if it's the same here in Italy, but I'll see :)
LOL, actually I reduced alcohol consuming lately ;-)
this guy has the art of bottle cutting to a art...
There is a much easier, faster way to cut glass bottles... using cotton string, Acetone, flame and cold water.
If you haven't, you should look up glass cracking off, I think it's called. much easier to cut a glass bottle.
I still don't known how to cut the glass bottle if I have no useful tools around... there you go!
okay, thank you~
Sometimes, I hope I can be in your head with a pen and a notepad.
It could be useful.
Kudos!
It looks very beautiful. You could also glue the bottom back so people keep wondering how you managed to get the bulb inside. ;P
Excellent! I love the nice, clean break you got on the bottle.
I've been working on a project that involves cutting a large glass bottle, and I reviewed your cutting jig in the process a while ago. That's a great jig, and I may build one soon. Great work all around!
seamster, your projects are impressive! Glad to help you!
haha cool! Seems like a very efficient way to use my leftover beer bottles ;)
yeah, good work then!

The Lehigh-Northampton Airport Authority Board of Governors on Tuesday unanimously approved an agreement to sell about 234 acres in Northampton County to Rock-Lehigh Valley LLC, a subsidiary of the FedEx developer, The Rockefeller Group.
That's on top of the authority's $9.8 million sale to Rock-Lehigh Valley of 260 acres for the FedEx project. The long-awaited closing on the FedEx land is expected in mid-May, with the sale of the 234 acres anticipated in 2017, airport authority Executive Director Charles Everett said Tuesday.
An appraisal of the 234 acres a few years back put the value of the land at $6.86 million, at a per acre price of $38,000 for 78.7 acres in Allen Township and $25,000 for 155 acres in East Allen Township, Everett said. A new appraisal is needed, Everett said, but he expects the land to be worth at least the prior estimate. The agreement requires Rock-Lehigh Valley to pay the fair market price for the land, or it can cancel the deal, according to Everett.
The land abuts the FedEx Ground site, which is off Willowbrook Road. It has been leased out by the authority for agricultural use.
Representatives of The Rockefeller Group did not immediately respond Tuesday to requests for comment on potential plans for the 234 acres.

The Rockefeller Group subsidiary faced a deadline on Friday to buy the 234 acres, under a master agreement entered into by the authority in 2013, Everett said. Rather than extend the deadline, the two sides entered into the purchase/sale agreement approved Tuesday by the authority.
The authority now has 30 days to apply for a deed of release from the Federal Aviation Administration and Rock-Lehigh Valley has 12 months to obtain approvals needed to develop the land, Everett said.
The airport authority owns and operates three airports: Lehigh Valley International Airport in Hanover Township, Lehigh County; Queen City Airport in Allentown and Braden Airpark in Forks Township. Selling these 234 acres is projected to shore up authority finances in the long term, Everett said.
"We're very excited," he said about the sale. "That has been the long-term priority for the authority, to sell some of the surplus property so that we can satisfy our goal of being financially sustainable into the long-term future."
The authority in January, according to Everett, paid off the balance of a $26 million court judgment entered against it over the 1990s condemnation of property that was to be the Willow Brook Estates housing development.
On the FedEx land, Everett said all parties have signed a settlement agreement resolving claims by the Fuller Family Trust, owner of Willow Brook Farms, that a deed restriction barring industrial development survived the authority's condemnation of the property.
"We are waiting for a fully executed copy," he said Tuesday. "We are pushing for closing in the middle of May."
A representative of the Fuller Family Trust did not immediately return a call for comment Tuesday afternoon.
FedEx had been wooed by Majestic Realty and Bethlehem officials to locate its ground hub in a 981,321-square-foot warehouse and distribution facility approved by city officials along Commerce Center Boulevard, off Route 412, in the city.
The Allen Township site remains the preferred location of FedEx Ground for the $335 million facility, spokesman David Westrick said Tuesday.
"We are continuing to work with everyone we need to," he said. "We want to expedite remaining approvals and hopefully begin breaking ground in the spring."

During the holidays, I hear a lot of people say “I’m going to make major changes starting January 1st” or “I’m really going to eat healthier after New Year’s” but a few weeks or months go by and those goals have been thrown out the window. It is too often that our resolutions are unrealistic and we expect immediate perfection. We get ourselves ready to eat healthy and exercise, depriving ourselves completely of the foods we most enjoy and spending every day in the gym. After a few weeks we are burnt out. Instead, try starting with small steps and celebrating milestones along the way. These small steps are shown to be more helpful strategies in keeping resolutions.
A great resource to help turn those resolutions into real solutions is USDA’s MyPlate, My Wins. Myplate, My Wins helps you find healthy solutions by focusing on all five MyPlate food groups including fruits, vegetables, grains, protein, and dairy. MyPlate tips and tools helps can help you make small, practical changes that can provide big results over time. With a customized healthy eating checklist, tip sheets from meal planning to a healthier daily coffee, and the Super Tracker, a free online food and activity tracker, you are sure to have all the resources you need to make big wins in 2017. MyPlate Super Tracker is hosting a 5-week MyPlate New Year’s Challenge. The focus of the Challenge is on the 5 MyPlate food groups and incorporating healthier eating style into your life. The Challenge began on January 2nd, but you are still able to sign up online.
There is also a new video series available with MyPlate, My Wins. New videos will be launched every week for the next 5 weeks. These videos give examples of simple changes you can make to your typical meals to decrease sodium, saturated fat, and added sugars. These videos provide solutions that can actually fit in to your busy life, such as quick breakfast ideas and healthier take out options.
To sign up for the Challenge, visit. You can also visit for resources to make healthier changes in 2017.
Follow these five tips from choosemyplate.gov to help your resolutions become real solutions:
1. Star with small changes – Instead of a diet overhaul, make small changes to what you eat and drink that will work for you now and in the future.
2. Take one day at a time – Sometimes things don’t go as planned, even with the best of intentions. If you miss one day or one milestone for your goal, don’t give up.
3. Be active your way – Pick activities you enjoy! If you focus on having fun or learning a new skill that interests you, you will be more likely to stick with it.
4. Team up – Find a friend with similar goals. Swap healthy recipes and be active together. Staying on track is easier with support and a cheerleader.
5. Celebrate successes – Think of each change as a “win” as you build positive habits and find ways to reach your goals. Reward yourself, you’ve earned it!

Always, Brother!!!! 😁
😁😁😁
Great quote, Syl! When we allow our hearts to live it always looks towards the sky. That’s where ways show up and that’s what makes the heart faithful and strong!
Thank you, Erika! A hard heart doesn’t allow anything inside, but an open heart experiences life.
That’s so wonderfully said, yes only an open heart lives!
Thank you!
I thank you!!
😊😊Hi guys! So last night was our night out on the town. We decided to try Bull McCabes. The atmosphere was great. Right in downtown and there was a good amount of people there! It started off really fun.
Red eye to the max! We got the seven layer dip for the appetizer and for dinner I ordered the chicken quesadillas (which just happened to be an appetizer as well haha).
I ate like one and half before throwing in the napkin. Our conversation was somewhat lacking though. And my dad said his steak and cheese sandwich was awful. Then it seemed like the wait staff completely forgot about us. When they remember us they brought us the wrong check. We all agreed that we would still go back sometime in the future though. When we made it home my parents went straight to bed. I stayed up for a while so I could still fit in a snack. I just had a blueberry muffin and an apple that I nuked in the microwave with cinnamon. Surprising tasty for how weird it looked!
This morning I woke up and I was just automatically grumpy. It was raining. AGAIN. My dad needed to go to the office and my parents decided that we would all go to Roxboro and go to Golden Corral for breakfast. That is pretty much the only place to get breakfast in Roxboro. I wasn’t thrilled but I sucked it up. It was a late breakfast and it didn’t help me with filling up my starch bubbles at all. I had an omelet with peppers, onions and jalapenos, fruit, and a chocolate milk. It was tasty and I actually finished it all.
I was too scared to venture outside of that though. After breakfast we dropped my dad off at the office and then we ran to the laundromat to wash Vinnie’s sheet and blanket. Yay for dirtying public washers instead of our own! (Sorry public)
While the blankets were in the wash we walked over to Tractor Supply. We got Vinnie Hoof Heal and a lunge whip so we don’t have to continue borrowing Renee’s. My mom and I wandered around the entire store killing time. Once we were done at the laundromat we went back to check on my dad at the office. He still had work so we took a trip to Walmart. We didn’t find anything we were hoping to get. Boooo. But, we didn’t spend money! Haha! When we got back my dad was all ready to go so we hit the road. Once we made it home (after a pit stop at one of my dad’s clients and Dollar General for cat food) I fixed myself lunch. I had a pasta portions with carrots, green pepper, onion, and chicken sausage. Those pasta portions are so convenient! I know exactly what I am getting, they only take 3 minutes once the water boils, and it’s boiled in the bag so you don’t have to strain it!
My dad announced we were going to go to The Reuse Warehouse so we scarfed down our lunches. He checked on the status of the table for our back porch and I did a quick lap to see if there was anything I could’t live without. Nothing jumped out at me this time. I then asked if we could go to Lowe’s so I could look at some supplies I was thinking about using for a project in my bedroom. I found what I had in mind but didn’t get anything because I still need to do some more planning. Back at home my mom wanted us to do meal planning. We only had to plan three nights because we will be leaving for Chattanooga Wednesday morning! That took us a while though because we couldn’t really come up with anything and we were searching for recipes. For my snack I had a glass of milk and my trusty trail mix.
I relaxed on the couch while I munched on it. I watched some Netflix then browsed Pinterest for ideas. My mom then came and asked me if I was ok with her and my dad having a date night. I thought it was silly that she had to ask, of course I was fine with it! I think they were in need of a break away from me. I was grumpy all day. I was just having a really difficult time with everything today. I just couldn’t handle anything. It all annoyed me. Food, the radio, people. Just everything. I just had a bad attitude and I am sure my parents didn’t want to be around that for dinner haha. I was happy to have the house to myself. I ended up spending the entire evening working on redoing my necklace. I combined my two necklaces to make a new one. I used the charm my sister brought back from Ireland, the Penguins charm from my aunt and her family, and the Jasper stone from Mary. I also added two things two it for some more color 🙂 That was a great project for getting my mind off of my struggles with food from the day. It was relaxing just to make something. I love the feeling I get whenever I am done with a project that I made. It is so empowering to look at the finished project and think I made that.
Once I finished my necklace (I kept making adjustments so it took a while haha) I prepped the oven for the thin crust pizza we had in the freezer. You guys have seen me eat this before. I said that because I completely forgot to snap a picture of it. My parents came home before I started eating and I was too excited to show my dad my project ideas! This pizza doesn’t scare me. It is a very thin crust and I know exactly how to count it on my bubble plan because it had a nutrition label. My dad’s pizza overwhelms me because it is thicker crust, triple the cheese, and I have no idea how to bubble it in. I am just not comfortable with leaving behind the exactitude of foods that I for sure know what they are. I will get there though! One day soon I will be able to throw down my dad’s pizza without having a care in the world what is on it or how much. New goal right there! While my pizza was in the oven I made my new breakfast Boost recipe. I popped that in the oven once my pizza was done. You will have to wait till tomorrow to find out what it is! I hope it is good haha. I also hope that it helps me get off to a better start to my day. I don’t need another repeat of today. I am glad that my parents got a break away from me tonight though, they really deserve it. Plus I feel bad because if it weren’t for my being in this situation they would be enjoying their empty nest and they would have all the alone time they wanted. So I am always happy when they can go spend some quality time together! It gives me a break too 😉
Hope you had a non-grumpy Saturday, unlike me! What do you say we all have an exuberant Sunday?
Beth, you are looking like the Beth I know!!!!!!! How is that booty coming?! We all need a break from each other, it makes us appreciate the wonderful, awesome people we have in our lives that love us endlessly. Brian and I miss you guys and love you to the MAX!
My booty is coming along! I just put on a pair of jeans and they are fitting a lot tighter, which I love! It means it’s all coming back. Remember what you told our waiter at Dirty Dicks in North Myrtle beach? You said I “had the ass of the family.” I think that’s what you said anyways haha. But I am ready for that to be true again! And you are so right, I woke up today appreciating my parents so much more. We love and miss you too!44 McMillan Street

Summer is here and love is in the air. If it’s a first date, five year anniversary or guy-spying at a late afternoon wedding, romantic makeup is the way to go!
No matter your skin tone, begin by blending a liquid foundation with a sun protecting moisturizer and apply throughout the face and neck. Use a concealer brush to conceal hyper-pigmentation and redness along the under eye, nasal folds and along the outer creases of the lips and mouth. Meld your concealer and foundation blend with a moistened sponge for a luminous complexion.
Sweep a wash of pale pink blush onto the apples of the cheeks and throughout the temples to give the illusion of a romantic pink cheek.
Stick with minimalist eyes to achieve this look. Start with shimmering pale tones for fair skin and subtle coppers if you’ve got a deeper complexion. Apply a thin eye liner along the upper lash line to create subtle definition. Sweep mascara onto the upper and lower lashes.
Make lips the center of attention with a fruity watermelon or strawberry pink lipstick or gloss.A.
The $4.4-million-dollar project requested the County help make the project a reality with a donation of $1.5 million, with the option to eventually take over ownership of the athletic and recreation complex.
The council did not make a decision at their September meeting but said they would like to hear from the public, and that they did.
Henlopen Soccer Club Board Member John Robinson said the club is in “dire need” of a well-maintained home, and the sports complex would be just that.
“It would be a wonderful boon for young people here in the county — not only for soccer players, but there will be lacrosse, track, and, I think you’re already going to hear about pickleball.”
Robinson also quoted numbers from an ESPN article from last year showing the impact of soccer on today’s youth.
“In this country, presently, over 20 percent of young people play soccer from ages 6 to 17. That’s in the boys’ category. In the young ladies’ category, it’s 17 percent,” he said. “If you add in track and lacrosse, the totals increase to 40 percent for boys and 37 percent for girls. I’m not sure about the statistics for pickleball, but I do know it’s a fun game.”
Chris Nichols, who also serves on the board of the Henlopen Soccer Club said the complex’s impact would be felt far beyond the time spent on the field. He noted that he and his wife — both Sussex County natives — returned to the area after college to start their business.
“One of the things we struggle with is attracting and keeping professional folks. Believe it or not, the complex will help us all accomplish that, because in order to live here, you have to see yourself here — not see ourselves traveling to Salisbury, or see us traveling to Milford, or to Frederica — but being Sussex Countians, living in this county where we want to play and raise our children,” he said.
“I’m asking you, please: help us let the kids and the families see themselves in Sussex County. Someone has to work at the hospital, someone has to build the houses, someone has to fix the HVAC. Telling them, ‘Do that, and take your kids somewhere else for the weekend’ is not the Sussex County I want to be in. Your sign says you’re my business partner. I’m asking my business partner to approve the complex.”
Kathy Casey, president of the First State Pickleball Club, told the council that, presently, the club has 424 members. She also noted that senior citizens are a significant portion of Sussex County residents.
“I know having an active healthy lifestyle is critical in this population, because we probably represent the biggest chance of disease coming your way. The healthier you keep us, the happier you’ll be,” she said.
“What I see, and why this project is so near and dear to me, is I get to see the joy that is created as a result of having public recreation, where anyone — regardless is socioeconomic status — has the opportunity to go out and play.”
Millsboro resident Marion Lisehora said she picked up pickleball six years ago and has been playing the sport every day since.
“At 86, I am still promoting sports for seniors in Sussex County and the Sussex sports complex that is proposed for pickleball, along with all the field sports, is really something I’m promoting,” she said. “Seniors need something active to do. We are lacking in places to play. Please support another place for us to play where people my age and the younger ones…”
Susan Brooker, who serves on the board of the Delaware Senior Olympics, as well as a USA Pickleball Association ambassador, brought pickleball equipment for the council to check out.
“The money will come back to you,” she asserted. “It isn’t just going to help out seniors.”
Steve Burke, who serves on the board of the Henlopen Soccer Club and the board of the Sussex Sports Center Foundation, and serves on the Sussex Academy School Board, said the complex would be a great asset to kids throughout the county.
Burke said the club, which was founded in 1996, has 1,300 players, with about 2,500 parents supporting the organization.
“We don’t turn away any children from playing the sport of soccer. We believe it develops our players, adds to their quality of life and develops them into meaningful adults.”
Having lost its home about a year ago, the club has had to divide up and play at various locations, which he said makes it difficult logistically, but has also raised injury concerns, as not all areas upon which they now play are ideal.
He noted that the board of the Henlopen Soccer Club has decided to unanimously support the complex, and to arrange its fee structure, based on its current numbers, to contribute up to $50,000 per year of ongoing support for the complex.
“We understand this is a difficult position. We understand the investment is tough for you to justify, but we ask you help us support the position and help us financially support the infrastructure that is needed for the complex.”
Councilman Rob Arlett asked where in the process the County is, in terms of discussing whether or not to contribute financial support to the project.
County Administrator Todd Lawson said the County would be accepting comments regarding the complex through the month of October.
“There’s no hard deadline, but I do think they do want a decision,” he said.
Arlett said he has more questions and would like the issue placed back on the council agenda.
Councilman George Cole asked if the item needed to be placed on the agenda or if it could be a discussion in an executive session.
County Solicitor J. Everett Moore Jr. said the discussion would have to be conducted in a public forum.
The council agreed to place the sports complex on a future agenda for discussion.
Those who wish to email comments may do so online at or by mailing comments to Sussex County Council, P.O. Box 589, Georgetown, DE 19947.

Scrubbish, wiping, sweeping, packing, folding and drying - they are all perpetual chores that you have to tackle everyday to ensure your living space is tidy. And while cleaning can be physically exhausting in itself, remembering what needs to be done and how best to approach it each week can be mentally trying too. Luckily there are myriad apps out there aimed specifically at helping you keep on top of everything.
From tools to help you organise your cleaning schedule to motivational apps for keeping on the right track, there’s something out there for everyone. Here are 5 excellent FREE apps to help keep your home tidy and organised.
The default iPhone and Android to-do apps are fine for everyday use, but for the homeowner with a never-ending flow of chores to keep on top of, something with a little more functionality may be necessary.
OurHome is an excellent organisational tool for creating lists of chores and ensuring they are done on time, every time. With the app you can create a list of tasks, set how regularly they need to be done and reminders for when they are due.
Seems fairly standard right? Well, the feature that sets OurHome apart from the competition is the interface, which lets you assign different chores to different members of a household. Say you live in a sharehouse and want to assign tasks to your housemates - OurHome lets you easily do so, and keep track of who has been assigned what.
If you have kids, OurHome is a great way to encourage them to do housework; you simply assign them tasks that, when completed, award points for “good behaviour”, which can in-turn be traded for virtual prizes (“Monsters”). Very cool.
The Home Routines app is better if you are the sole person in your home that takes care of the cleaning and need a way to stay organised. Home Routines allows you to divide your home into “focus zones”. Each zone (such as your garage or yard) can be allocated to a specific time or day, which is a great way to ensure you don’t miss anything.
Other features include a easy to use to-do list, daily reminders, a handy timer function that is great for making sure you don’t procrastinate!
Keeping on top of cleaning can be hugely time consuming, meaning you may end up putting little into making your home the way you want it. This app great for making sure you are spending as much time ensuring your house is the best it can be.
BrightNest is all about giving you ideas; the app is packed with information on basic maintenance, home décor and how to make your home a better place to live in. There are articles on everything from how to unclog a shower head to how to clean your oven. And best of all, you can customize it to be relevant to your home and what goals you wish to achieve.
Check out the BrightNest website to get a feel for the kind of information the app provides and how it can help make your home as pleasant as it can be.
Your home is your personal haven, so naturally it will be filled with your favourite possessions. Over time, you amass more and more, and keeping track of everything you own can become near impossible. HomeZada is here to help.
HomeZada’s Mobile App lets you quickly and easily create a digital inventory of your home. It lets you photograph and organise your home by rooms, so you can easily keep track of what you own and where it lives, which can be very helpful in the case of an accident like a fire or robbery! It even provides you with a formatted Household Inventory PDF and an ‘Export to Excel’ function for reporting purposes. Neat.
Sometimes, you might simply just not have enough time on your hands to do everything yourself. In this case, finding someone else to do a job for you is the best option. And hey, there’s nothing wrong with seeking a helping hand.
Handy gives you access to thousands of home service professionals. Whether you need a rubbish removal service, a plumber or someone to help you pull up your old carpet, you’ll find them on Handy. It’s super easy to use and only takes a minute or so to book, leaving you with more time to kick back and relax.

Today's careers for graduates with a degree in pharmacy may be different than that old time druggist who not simply whipped up cough medicine in the back room and also could whip up a fancy ice cream treat on the counter.
Limited awareness and insufficient oversight among doctors, pharmacists and the patients may also contribute to the problem. If a pharmacist includes a problem with providing a customer with any medication that is specifically prescribed by way of a Doctor or in general deemed safe for that general public from the FDA, chances are they are in the wrong field. Terms may change every so often so it helps you to double-check together with your provider about this matter just before treatment.
Shop and compare the values offered when compared to any local pharmacy. They are paid in salary as opposed to hourly wages. They are managing the resources efficiently with the organizations like hospital or clinics also evaluate medicines and be sure that they are safe to use.
The pharmaceutical industry especially can't afford to allow its practitioners to delay or refuse treating clients due to the perceived utilization of any medical device, it could be a pill or possibly a syringe. The above image shows that a secure protocol ( is being used with the fraudster. If possible try to use a similar pharmacy around possible.
This pertains to almost everything beginning with your ordering of treatment all the way to delivery. So if you are looking to move forward and embrace this new digital age and build your own E Commerce pharmacy I suggest you have a look at. Their mission is to find approaches to improve their patient's lives by lowering stress and adding a little bit of mind to what can certainly be a hard to manage experience.[Editor’s Note: This review may contain spoilers]

Summary
John has received a priority one alert for a mission on Earth and selects Hal to go despite much protesting from Kyle and Guy. The recent events in Superman #29 and Superman #30 have finally reared it’s yellow head in Hal Jordan and the Green Lantern Corps. Hal has been tasked with verifying Sinestro’s apparent return from the dead.
Hal meets up with Superman and get’s a recap from the Man of Steel of his encounter with Sinestro and Parallax. Superman claims to have Parallax in Sinestro’s ring, but Hal says Parallax is not there. Hal begins to hear a voice – Parallax? Parallax has apparently buried himself deep in Superman’s subconscious and is now taking over.
Parallax and Hal duke it out for a few pages before Parallax lays a heavy Kryptonian blow on Hal. When Hal opens his eyes Superman appears normal and describes what happened from his point of view. Hal hears that voice again, and when he figures out that Superman can’t, he realizes what it is and realizes where he has to go – Hector Hammond!
Positives
Patrick Zircher’s work evokes a classic look that makes the story not only accessible, but feels familiar even though it’s new. It’s nice to see Hal and Clark catch up after Hal’s been off planet for so long. Their conversation feels real and it covers the territory of family above all else. It also serves to explore how the DC Universe fits together. It makes only sense that Sinestro’s battle with Superman would eventually bring a Green Lantern calling. The twist at the end was also nice touch.
Negatives
No real negatives, although some readers may not be as excited about the book taking Hal back to adventures on Earth as opposed to the more cosmic adventures of the Corps.
Verdict
There’s never a dull moment in Hal Jordan and the Green Lantern Corps. Just when you think you’ve got it figured out, there’s a twist in the tale. Bring on Hector Hammond!

So many times we see press articles and releases describing pop-up shooters like Call of Duty, and even the over the top gangster machinations of Grand Theft Auto as "mature" but games still have acres of ground to catch up with even the slackest efforts pumped out by Hollywood.
When Heavy Rain first started to surface, most of the press coverage seemed obsessed with the strive to take videogame characters a step closer towards "Uncanny Valley" - the almost perfect reproduction of human characters and human-like characteristics.".

Standard ProcessClient Description Standard Process, of Palmyra, WI, has been a leader in the field of nutritional supplements for over 70 years. The company is committed to a whole food philosophy first introduced by its founder, Dr. Royal Lee. Dr. Lee believed that the best sources of vitamins and minerals are found in whole foods. To preserve the nutrients of the whole food, concentrated supplements are created using a unique manufacturing process. This process involves raw foods grown on company owned farms; state-of-the art manufacturing equipment, and continual testing to ensure quality control. Standard Process Inc. ships to 20,000 healthcare professionals including doctors, nutritionists, chiropractors, and nurse practitioners all over the country.
NeedBefore contacting ZR Data Systems, Inc. Standard Process performed all warehouse operations manually on paper. Standard Process was using an outdated management system that had update lag times as long as 30 days. Standard Process had no warehouse visibility resulting in personnel having to physically search the warehouse for goods. There were no formal procedures for put away, inventory or shipping.
Standard Process realized they had to replace its system with an up to date, best-of-breed warehouse management system. However Standard Process required a system that could still work with their current accounting system and whatever ERP system replaced it. The new WMS system would also have to by Windows 2000 compliant, SQL Server based, and RF capable.
The System
Receiving
Standard Process will handle all receiving through the Receipt from Production and Receipt from Vendor processes. These processes will handle incoming product and produce pallet labels to identify product for storage.
Transfers
The transfer of materials into the warehouse from other storage facilities and transfer of materials from the warehouse to outside storage facilities will be handled through the Warehouse Transfer In, Warehouse Transfer Out, Inventory Decrement, and Inventory Increment processes.
Picking
Order fulfillment will be handled through the single order picking. Product can be picked to either a staging location or directly to the dock door.
Standard Process will incorporate Lighting Pick pick-to-light system into its picking process. Operators will place cartons on conveyor system that passes Lighting Pick picking stations. Pickers with RF handhelds will scan the container label and Lighting Pick will indicate what must be picked for that box. After picking is complete the container will be taken to the packing station via the conveyor and then staged or taken to a door location.
Loading will be accomplished through System-directed and Non-directed loading. System-directed Loading will require the user to enter and order number, a door location and then verify each line of the order including item, lot, quantity and line number. Non-directed loading will simply require an order number and a door location.
Auditing a Load
Shipping
Standard Process will utilize Kewill's K-Ship manifesting system. The WMS system will be responsible for writing order data to K-Ship and reading back tracking numbers, freight cost, expected pickup, expected delivery, etc.
OutcomeStandard Process was able to eliminate physical inventory and its associated labor costs all together, relying on quarterly cycle counting. The company has also been able to maintain its high level of customer service as it has grown. Client Feedback"We've increase packages shipped per labor hour and shipping efficiency by 50 percent." -Scott Anderson, Standard Process Plant Manager
"Even with steady growth, we've managed with existing warehouse space which would have been very difficult, if not impossible, without the new system." -Scott Anderson, Standard Process Plant Manager

Read on to learn the benefits of online shopping.
With online shopping, begin seeking out good sales early in the week. Wednesday is usually the first day sales ads appear. Most regular stores have sales through the weekend, so online stores have started to begin their sales before the weekend. That’s why you can find really good bargains online in the middle of the week.
If you want the best deals, consider registering for the newsletters offered at your favorite stores. Frequently, stores save their best offers for first-time registrants. They’ll keep giving deals that are good to people that have any kind of interest in their brand, so signing up can save you a lot.
Look at sizing charts when shopping for clothes. It’s hard to tell if an item will fit you correctly when shopping online. Many online clothing shops have some kind of sizing charts to help you figure out your size. This can save you a lot of frustration in the end.
Bookmark a few coupon sites and visit them before making a purchase. You can find coupons for manufacturers and retailers alike, all of which can save you great amounts of money. Just be sure you don’t forget to look them up prior to shopping.
Use all the shopping sites at your disposal. You should have no problem finding sites that cater to all needs. You can then search those sites to find the one item you are looking for. You will be able to see the best price on the items you want. A lot of the time you’ll see the shipping cost too here.
If you shop at a particular retailer online, download their mobile app. This can be of use to you in a couple of ways. For example, you can shop right from your device. Also, you can use your app when you are actually in a store to see if the price is worth it.
Register for the newsletters of the online retailers you frequently purchase from. If you buy online frequently, the newsletter subscription can provide you with inside information on deals and products that are not announced to the general public yet. That will help you get the products you want and need at bargain prices while there is still plenty in stock.
If you order an expensive item online, it is best to pay more for shipping so the store can send it through UPS or another reliable carrier. Do not hesitate to pay more so the package can be insured or expedited faster. If you are not going to be home when the shipment is expected, ask a neighbor that you trust to look out for it for you.
Are you feeling less stressed out about shopping online now? Things are constantly changing in the world of online shopping; you now know more about these changes. This information is sure to serve you well. It’s not terribly difficult, but you have to understand how to shop online if you’d like to get the most out of it.Bravery & Courage

11th. October 1848
My dear McLean,
I have been a long while fulfilling my promise of sending you a line, but to tell the truth, no opportunity has offered of my obtaining any information upon the points to which our attention was directed, until Captain Grey's arrival the other day.
The result has been that for the present, at least, I shall remain in the South; both of us being charged with the purchase of land for the Company, - yourself, between this and Whanganui, and the Wairarapa or Canterbury settlement being my portion. What time these duties will take is uncertain. Suffice it to say that the Governor-in-Chief has decided upon our receiving one guinea per day, in addition to our ordinary salary. This is to include forage for horse, and everything else, while engaged on this special service.
No certificated or Bills will now be necessary. I think, on the whole, the allowance liberal. What say you?
I had several interviews with Captain Grey upon this and other matters, and I think he is disposed to treat the Native Officers liberally. I embodied the whole of our views upon the subject; and gave him a very broad hint that Officers would not be found willing to accept the employment, unless better paid. On the whole I think prospects good; and an untiring and unceasing agitation when good opportunities offer, will tend much to further our views. I rely, therefore, much upon your cooperation and advice.
Mr. Mantell is in the Middle Island, carrying out the details of the recent purchase I made there. Captain Grey is well pleased with both our exertions there and at Whanganui.
Mr. Bell accompanies me to the -----(?) on the part of the Company; and this will probably meet you on the way down to the Rangitikei.
Symonds is gone home, and for the present the duties of Native Secretary, at Auckland, will be carried out through the Civil Secretary' Department.
I am glad to hear of your recovery from the severe attack at Whanganui; and believe me,
faithfully yours, (Signed)
H.T. Kemp.cold vs warm
I started off on a really good foot with Coach Warm Weather when I was trying to make conversation with her before practice started. She was counting the girls and wondering who she was missing. I said, "Miss Thing said there was a girl at last practice who didn't really want to play, is she here yet?" "Yes, she's here, that would be MY daughter." So, mom doesn't want to play soccer because it is too cold and her daughter doesn't want to play soccer because she prefers dance and gymnastics. Should be an interesting season.

My basic qualm about the recipe is that the baking mix contained hydrogenated shortening. I try not to over-worry about such things, but as well as being bad for your arteries, hydrogenated shortening is flavorless. So when I ran across this simple butter and egg-based impossible pie recipe, from a Land O’Lakes Shortcut Baking booklet, I gave it a try. The result was really delicious. A delicate, silky custard tasting of coconut, vanilla and nutmeg forms magically above a soft crust. The coconut flavor is not pronounced. This pie is so easy and inexpensive, but it can be company fare.
Magic Coconut Custard Pie
2 cups milk
1 cup sweetened flaked coconut
3/4 cup sugar
1/2 cup flour
3 tablespoons butter, melted
4 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla
Heat oven to 325 degrees. Grease and flour a 9-inch ceramic or Pyrex pie pan; set aside.
Pour milk into a blender, and add remaining ingredients. Cover; blend at medium speed for about 1 to 2 minutes. The batter will have the consistency of a pancake batter.
Pour mixture into prepared pie plate. Bake for 40 to 50 minutes or until knife inserted in center comes out clean. Sprinkle with nutmeg, if desired. I decorated the pie with a sliced strawberry and a little bunch of grapes.
Baking notes: Be sure to use a 9-inch pie pan. The batter will fill up the pan almost to the top–don’t worry. It will grab the sides of the pan, puff up and not run over. Test the pie after about 40 minutes baking with the tip of a sharp knife. The pie will be a bit quivery, but the knife should come out clean if it’s done. Return to the oven and bake for a few minutes longer if the knife shows liquid batter. The pie can be served warm or cold, and cuts well either way.
Rabbit Rumpus
I was standing by the kitchen window sipping a cup of coffee when I noticed two rabbits hippity hop into the yard. The coffee was from Starbucks, and the caffeine was beginning to effect me like a hammer blow to the head. Perhaps because of this, I began imagining a story for the rabbits.
He was a veritable Brad Pitt among rabbits.
She was an Angelina Jolie.
It was love at first sight.
My romantic reverie was interrupted when Jim shouted “She’s giving birth!” The gardener in me had conflicted feelings.
But all was not as it seemed. They had a showdown.
Suddenly, all rabbit hell broke loose.
They fought.
There was a truce, and Angelina smoothed her ruffled fur.
I have the feeling this rabbit rumpus isn’t over. To be continued. . . .
My peach blossom tulips are blooming. Always love them! Peace, Fran

Well, like a lot of other things, the answer is: it depends. Sorry, I know that's so annoying, but, like many other things you're trying to define in your wedding budget, when it comes to wedding officiants, the cost depends on a number of variables.
Because there is a wide range of experience and service offered by the community of Maine wedding officiants , you need to know what kind of officiant you're looking for before we can talk about cost. In this blog post I'm going to offer you a few things to consider while contemplating who should perform your wedding ceremony. These ideas will likely determine how much you pay for your officiant.
1. Your Wedding Ceremony
Have you and your honey discussed what kind of a wedding ceremony you want? And I'm not just talking about whether you want a religious or secular ceremony. What I'm really asking you is how important is the ceremony to your wedding?
- Some folks don't really care what the officiant says as long as it's legal.
- For some folks, they just want a big party with all their friends and family and being the center of attention in front of all of their guests sounds like torture.
- Some folks want a super short (less than 15 minute) ceremony and to just get on with it.
- Other couples feel like the ceremony *is* the whole point of the wedding and they want it to be long enough to be significant but not so long that it's boring.
- Other couples want to be involved in writing the ceremony and don't want there to be any surprises on wedding day.
Once you decide on what kind of a ceremony you want then you can start looking for the right officiant.
2. The Wedding Officiant
Now that you know what kind of ceremony you want, you can start looking for your professional wedding officiant. I wrote a blog post about 10 things to consider before choosing your officiant, you should read it. Use Google to search for "Maine wedding officiants" or "wedding officiants in Maine" to get you started. We have a wonderfully diverse community of wedding officiants, because Maine is one of only three states that allow notaries public to perform wedding ceremonies. That means Maine offers hundreds of wedding officiants that come with a wide range of prices.
3. Wedding Officiant Fees
Price range: $75 - $1,500+
I'm not kidding, that's how wide a range you get from wedding officiants in Maine. See what I mean about "it all depends?" Because we have so many wedding officiants here in Maine, you'll find this wide a range of prices. The officiants charging $75 or $100 probably aren't doing this to earn a living, don't have much experience, or don't offer any customization, so that could be a great option if you just want to make it legal.
On the other hand, if you are looking for an officiant who will craft a completely custom wedding ceremony based on the two of YOU; your love story, your values, your family traditions, etc., there are a few officiants who provide this service. We help you plan the entire ceremony from pre-processional to signing the marriage license afterwards. We manage your rehearsal and work closely with all of your vendors to ensure a seamless experience. Some of us (definitely me) manage all the details of the ceremony so that you two can be relaxed and fully present during this significant moment in your lives. We "hold the space" in which your ceremony can unfold, welcoming the community of support that surrounds you into the proceedings, paying special attention to pacing and volume and breath.
Professional officiants in Maine like this charge the most and are totally worth it, IMO. Crafting a completely custom ceremony and supporting a couple through this process takes an incredible amount of energy, time, love, creativity, and experience. And, most likely, someone who devotes this much attention and intention into your wedding is earning their living by being a professional officiant, I know I am.
4. Finding the Right Officiant
Now you know what kind of a ceremony you want, what kind of an officiant you're looking for and about how much you'll need to budget for this professional vendor. Before you reach out to your short list of officiants, read this post about 5 things to ask your wedding officiant when meeting them for the first time.

They were selected by a panel of expert judges from 92 teams which were announced on the 6th of July.
The aim is to achieve the US Department of Energy’s (DOE) goal of doubling the power captured from ocean waves.
This is expected to reduce the cost of wave energy and make it more competitive.
The winners will receive a prize totalling more than $2 million (£1.3m).
Among other requirements, qualified teams will now build a 1/50th scale model and will participate in small-scale tank testing as a means of validating their concepts.
Finalist teams are scheduled to be announced in March 2016.
Wave Energy Scotland recently set up a similar competition.Thursday, July 31, 2008
How much worse can Bush administration foreign policy get?
Just when you thought the Bush administration had botched nearly every foreign policy crisis it has a hand in, the New York Times reported Thursday that U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that members of Pakistani spies helped plan the July 7 bombing at India's embassy in Kabul, Afghanistan. According to the Reuters international news service, U.S. officials told the Times that the U.S. had intercepted communications between Pakistani spies and militants who carried out the attack that killed 54. The officials also said new information showed that members of Pakistan's Directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence had provided the militants with details about planned U.S. missile strikes against them. Pakistan is reputedly an ally of the United States and the beneficiary of more than $10 billion in U.S. aid in the past 10 years, mostly to the government of President Pervez Musharraf to fight militants along its border with Afghanistan. But Pakistan has become overly concerned about the power of Aghanistan and India, its neighbors, and has maintained contacts with some of the militant groups, according to Reuters. What's the term for a situation in which the United States is funding Pakistan's fight against militants but Pakistan is actually aligning itself with militants fighting U.S. efforts in Afghanistan. Incomprehensible? Unthinkable? Ridiculous? Plus, India is one of the United States' closest allies and the two countries are considering a nuclear technology deal that will draw them even closer. This is a region that is desperate for some actual diplomacy, not just more weaponry.
Wait 'til next year for Mideast peace
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's decision Wednesday to resign as leader of the Kadima party means there is virtually no chance that Israel will be able to come to a settlement with the Palestinian Authority by the end of George W. Bush's presidency. Olmert, who is in the midst of a corruption investigation but has not yet been indicted, announced Wednesday that he would not run for re-election and will resign the prime minister's post after Sept. 17, when Kadima chooses a new chairman, according to the Reuters international news service. This has been treated with surprise internationally, because Bush had seemingly staked his administration's legacy on reaching a peace deal between the Israelis and the Palestinians. "I am not doing this out of a feeling that I cannot do my job ... I believe in my ability to continue," Olmert said at a news conference at his official residence. "When forced to choose between my own personal standing and considerations that relate to the welfare of the state, it is the latter that will take precedence." In his second year as prime minister, Olmert's government was negotiating peace deals simulaneously with the Palestinian Authority and with Syria, perhaps Israel's most intractable enemy. In Israel, leading politicians applauded Olmert's decision not to seek re-election. "Prime Minister Olmert made a right and appropriate decision," former prime minister Ehud Barak said.

Starbucks retreat excites investors, not customers
Investors might have been cheered Wednesday when U.S. coffee giant Starbucks Corp. detailed its plans to close 600 stores in the United States and lay off 12,000 workers, but legions of coffee drinkers probably had a much different reaction. Starbucks may well have brought the pleasures of premium coffee to tens of millions of U.S. residents, but the chain has dealt a mortal blow to family owned-and-operated coffeehouses that were long a staple in the urban setting. The chain's aggressive (acknowledged, finally, as over-aggressive) expansion killed off many independently owned coffeehouses in small communities. Now, the chain's retrenchment could leave a void. But that is not the concern of Wall Street investors, who pushed the company's shares up by four percent despite its first quarterly loss ever, according to the Reuters international news service. On Wednesday, Starbucks reduced its new-store expansion and posted a loss of $6.7 million in its fiscal third quarter, Reuters said. The loss was Starbucks' first since going public in 1992. The chain earned $158.3 million in last year's third quarter. Starbucks plans to close 200 U.S. stores in the next quarter and close the remaining 400 in its next fiscal year, which begins in October.

Who is most wrong on Olympic censorship?
Well, wasn't that stupid. Here we were, all worried about how China would react to being exposed to the crush of unfettered international media reporting that accompanies any Olympic games. But we needn't have been worried. The International Olympic Committee had already agreed in secret to allow censorship, the Reuters international news service reported Wednesday. Yes, the IOC made a secret deal with the Chinese government to prevent visiting journalists from accessing controversial Web sites that Beijing doesn't like, violating an earlier commitment to allow unrestricted access to the Internet. "I regret that it now appears [Beijing Olympic organizers] has announced that there will be limitations on website access during Games time," IOC press chief Kevan Gosper said. "I also now understand that some IOC officials negotiated with the Chinese that some sensitive sites would be blocked on the basis they were not considered Games related. Reuters said blocked Web sites its reporters had found included Amnesty International and Falun Gong, a spiritual group banned in China. So, what is the worst evil here? The Chinese, with their authoritarian government trying to censor the international media while saying they're not? Or the IOC, supposedly representing what is right in the world but actually making backroom deals to undercut the principle of free speech?

Why does housing industry need rescuing?
The U.S. Senate's approval Saturday of a housing market rescue bill is great news for the hundreds of thousands of homeowners who may now be able to save their homes. But why do Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the giant public-private mortgage lenders, need emergency financing? Those companies, which back half of the nation's $12 trillion in outstanding home loans, are the backbones of the national economy and are not supposed to be taking risks with the money. So how did they end up losing billions on bad home loans, causing their stock price to plummet? Could it be that the same loose government regulation responsible for the collapse of IndyMac Bankcorp, the third-largest financial institution ever to fail, also infected Fannie and Freddie? Isn't anyone paying attention? The new housing bill also sets up a new regulator to oversee Fannie and Freddie. But how can we rationally expect the government to fix a financial meltdown that is largely the result of its own action or inaction?

What are Russians complaining about?
Perhaps Russia reacted so defensively to U.S. President George Bush's July 18 proclamation equating the fascist Nazi regime with Soviet communism because the former Soviet Union and modern-day Russia are inextricably linked, and not because Moscow simply rejects the comparison out of hand. Russia's foreign ministry said Saturday that Bush had insulted World War II veterans and was trying to rewrite history with the proclamation, according to the Reuters international news service. More than 20 million Soviets died repelling an invasion by the Nazis and battling the brutal Nazi forces across Eastern Europe, after the Soviets joined with the Allies. Russians call the defeat of Nazi Germany the Great Patriotic War and Moscow said Bush's proclamation, which marked the annual Captive Nations Week, was an "insult" to veterans who sacrificed their lives in the war. Bush called Nazi fascism and Soviet communism "a single evil," Reuters said. But let's be serious here. It is Russia that is trying to rewrite history by ignoring its alliance with the Nazis at the start of World War II. The two stayed in their alliance for years until Germany turned on the Soviet Union in 1941 and launched a surprise attack, prompted the Soviets to join with the Allies. Russians surely have not already forgotten that the Soviet regime itself was brutally repressive, discriminating against minorities, sending millions of citizens to prison camps and dominating Eastern Europe for decades.

Friday bank seizures must mean something
What does it mean that U.S. regulators were forced Friday to seize two more banks and sell them? Well, probably not that the nation's banking system is as "sound" as U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson told the country it was last week. The takeovers of First National Bank of Nevada and First Heritage Bank NA of Pasadena, Calif., were the sixth and seventh bank failures this year, and the first since the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. seized IndyMac Bancorp. Inc. two weeks ago in the third largest such failure in U.S. history. The banks seized Friday, which were on the FDIC's list of 90 troubled U.S. financial institutions, were sold to Mutual of Omaha Bank, a division of the giant insurance company, according to the Rueters international news service. The combined 28 branches are scheduled to open Monday as branches of Mutual of Omaha bank. Paulson may indeed be correct in his contention that this year's bank failures are minor in respect to the entire banking system, but even he thinks there will be even more failures this year. There were only 32 bank failures between 2000 and 2007, according to FDIC data.

Nuclear power remains too risky
Wednesday's report of radiation contaminations at a nuclear reactor in southern France should remind everyone of the fearsome risks of the technology. Nuclear power has been mentioned prominently as an alternative source of energy to crude oil, which has skyrocketed in price this year. But the nuclear power industry has never resolved the danger factor, which includes the lack of a method for safe disposal of radioactive waste. The accident, which contaminated 100 workers, was the second incident at the Tricastin reactor site in the past two weeks, according to the Reuters international news service. On July 8, 30 cubic meters of liquid containing non-enriched uranium was poured onto the ground and into a river at the Tricastin site, Reuters said.

Power-sharing talks in Zimbabwe are counterproductive
There appears to be nothing to be gained from power-sharing talks announced today between Zimbabwe's bitter political rivals, President Robert Mugabe and opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai. Mugabe, who was re-elected in June in a runoff vote that Tsvangirai was forced to withdraw from, has embarassed his country in the eyes of the world and worsened its economic crisis. The June runoff between Mugabe and Tsvangirai was marked by violence against Tsvangirai supporters and resulted in the challenger withdrawing from the balloting and seeking refuge in the Dutch embassy. But the two signed a deal Monday to negotiate, according to the Reuters international news service, even though they are said to detest each other. The purpose of the talks, apparently, are to try to fashion a coalition government patterned after Kenya. But if Mugabe is guilty of fixing the first presidential vote, as suspected, and of encouraging his supporters to attack Tsvangirai supporters in the runoff, he has lost all credibility and should not be welcome in the new government. Mugabe certainly has no credibility internationally, and probably has little in his own country. After nearly three decades of his rule, Zimbabwe's currency is essentially worthless and the country's crumbling economy has forced millions to emigrate to neighboring nations, according to Reuters. Mugabe should be forced to surrender power and to seat the new parliament. He should have a date with the country's chief criminal prosecutor, not another term in office.

Maybe the treasury secretary was kidding
Not too many people think the Bush administration is trying to be funny, but what else could explain Sunday's comments by U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson that the banking system is sound? Paulson told Sunday morning television news programs that the U.S. economy would recover in several months and that problems in the banking system, exemplified by the July 11 federal takeover of IndyMac Bank, were "manageable," according to the Reuters international news service. "Our banking system is a safe and a sound one," Paulson told the CNN program "Late Edition." But earlier, Paulson told CBS that the number of banks in trouble would be growing, but was under control. "This is a very manageable situation ... our regulators are focused on it," Paulson said. That could have been reassuring, but not after Paulson said he was sure Congress would pass legislation to help shore up Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, long mainstays of the housing industry that props up the economy. News about how strong the economy is would make more sense if banks weren't tanking, Fannie and Freddie weren't broke, gasoline wasn't $5 a gallon and the dollar was holding its value. The IndyMac Bank failure was the third largest in U.S. history and did not happen because everything is fine. The only question is whether Paulson believes his own rhetoric or understands, like most everybody else does, that it is bull.

Shoddy construction in Iraq? Who would have thought?
The surge might be succeeding, but news that five U.S. senators have asked Defense Secretary Robert Gates for an independent review of electrical work by KBR Inc. at U.S. bases in Iraq after the electrocution of more than a dozen soldiers is another reminder of the incompetence and waste that has characterized the 2003 invasion. The Reuters international news agency reported Friday that the five senators -- Byron Dorgan of North Dakota, Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, Maria Cantwell of Washington, Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota -- have called on the Pentagon to employ an independent overseer to review the contractor's work. KBR Inc., the largest private contractor operating under contract to the U.S. military in Iraq, was spun off last year from Haliburton Inc., Dick Cheney's employer before he became Vice President. KBR has previously been accused overbilling and providing unsafe water to soldiers, Reuters said. In a letter to Robert Gates, the defense secretary, the senators said Houston-based KBR should not be inspecting its own work but that inspection responsibility should be given to a "well-qualified and objective" party. The Pentagon acknowledged that KBR was inspecting its own work, Reuters said, but said the Army Corps of Engineers and other agencies also reviewed the work. Dorgan said KBR should be suspended. A KBR spokeswoman said the company had found no link between its work and the electrocutions, Reuters said. The New York Times said the Pentagon knew about problems with KBR's work but did little to respond to them until a member of the Green Berets was electrocuted while taking a shower in January.

War crimes trial reveals a lot about ourselves
Thursday's decision by a federal judge to allow the first military trial of a Guantanamo Bay detainee, after lengthy pretrial proceedings, shows the strength of the U.S. system of justice. Even facing the opposition of U.S. leaders and contradictory legal precedents, the judiciary has forced an overly aggressive executive branch to respect the rights of the accused. This is a basic American value. As a result, the trial of Osama bin Laden's former driver, scheduled to begin next week, is probably going to be nothing like what the administration intended when it convinced Congress to establish a tribunal system for detainees captured in the war on terror. Detainee Salim Hamdan is going to be able to see the evidence against him and bring in other detainees as witnesses as a result of the legal process, over the objections of the Bush administration. U.S. citizens can be proud of upholding this nation's founding principles in the face of White House opposition cloaked in false patriotism, whether Hamdan is guilty or not.

The battle for control of the United States
The political battle over the White House's refusal to comply with a subpoena from Congress to turn over documents in the CIA leak case may seem like game-playing, but it really is a fight for control of the U.S. government. The Bush administration is already notorious for expanding the power of the president on control of the military, the budget and legislation in general; its attempt to wrest subpoena power from Congress is more of the same. But this time, especially, the risk of permitting an unchecked presidency is plainly obvious. Somebody, or some people, violated the law by revealing the identity of a CIA agent in 2003 and compromising the country's intelligence-gathering ability. President Bush promised to fire whoever did it; federal prosecutors might have other ideas about enforcing that particular law. An adviser to the vice president was convicted and pardoned by the president. But it appears obvious that the decision to expose the agent's identity was made in the upper reaches of the executive branch, perhaps by the vice president or the president or both, as retribution for criticism of the White House leveled by the agent's husband. There is no gain for the country if the leaker's identity is protected; only Bush's inner-circle profits from the refusal to turn over evidence. The House Oversight Committee must stop merely threatening a contempt citation against Attorney General Michael Mukasey and go ahead with the indictment; Congress may have to dispatch soldiers to the White House to get the documents. The people of the United States have a right to know -- once and for all -- who is the government employee or employees who compromised the nation's security for political gain.

Decision time for Beijing
With the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing fast approaching and its international presence fast expanding, China is going to have to make a decision about what kind of contribution it wants to make to world affairs. Beijing weighed in Tuesday with "grave concern" over the genocide charge leveled against Sudan's president by International Criminal Court, but not in the way you'd think. China's "misgivings" are not about the 35,000 killed by Sudanese forces or the 2.5 million forced to flee their homes in the Darfur region but are about being called on by Western nations to temper support for Sudan President Omar Hassan al-Bashir. China is a top investor in Sudan's oil industry and is the country's largest arms provider. An arrest warrant for al-Bashir is expected to be issued shortly, obligating China or any other country to arrest him if he visits. The Chinese do not want to have to do this to such a good customer, and have been fighting the imposition of more severe sanctions against Sudan. But stopping genocide is the very essence of international diplomacy, and China must join the civilized world in doing so. China recently used its veto power on the United Nations Security Council to join Russia in blocking sanctions against the murderous and illegal Mugabe regime in Zimbabwe. But China is no longer a rogue regime -- it is becoming a superpower, and it's time it started acting like one. If China wants respect on the international stage befitting a world power, it will have to do a lot more than provide a venue for sporting events.

Administration's crude shell game
U.S. President Bush's decision Monday to lift an executive-level ban on offshore oil drilling effected by his father in 1990 and to increase pressure on Congress to lift a legislative ban is nothing short of demagoguery. Bush is trying to harness frustration over rapidly rising gasoline prices -- the result of his administration's inept handling of energy and foreign policy -- and use it to despoil the coastline and even further enrich his greedy friends in the oil industry. "Failure to act is unacceptable -- it's unacceptable to me and it's unacceptable to the American people," Bush said at a White House event, according to the Associated Press. Bush called on the Democratic Party majority in Congress to "facilitate responsible offshore exploration." Of course, Bush made no mention of his administration's failure to develop a comprehensive energy policy, failure to encourage the use of solar energy and failure to encourage domestic output from existing oilfields and leased lands. He also failed to mention why Congress failed to act when his Republican Party allies were in control.

Failure of mortgage giant could be isolated but probably isn't
Federal banking regulators sought to reassure the public Friday after seizing IndyMac Bancorp Inc., in what is being called the third-largest banking failure in U.S. history. The Pasadena, Calif.-based mortgage lender, which held as much as $8 billion in deposits, failed Friday after a crush of withdrawals from panicked depositors, according to the Reuters international news service. IndyMac specialized in mortgages to borrowers with limited resources and was especially vulnerable to the nationwide downturn in property values. The bank is expected to reopen Monday as IndyMac Federal Bank under the control of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., Reuters said. The director of the Office of Thrift Supervision, John Reich, blamed IndyMac's failure on recent comments by a powerful Democratic senator, even though the institution already was in distress. "This institution failed today due to a liquidity crisis," Reich said. "Although this institution was already in distress, I am troubled by any interference in the regulatory process." Sen. Charles Schumer questioned IndyMac's stability in June and blamed the OTS for lax regulation of the bank. That, of course, is most likely true considering the bank's unique financing scheme. But it also is highly likely that the collapse of IndyMac is a result of pressure on the economy from the mortgage crisis, which means more instability lies ahead. With the federal government ideologically opposed to taking concrete actions to fix the problems, more bank collapses are probably on the horizon.

Pentagon calls 'do-over' on air tanker contract
The downside of globalization was on display Wednesday when the U.S. Defense Department announced it had reopened the bidding for a disputed $35 billion contract to build air tankers for the Air Force, the Associated Press reported. The contract had been awarded to the team of Northrup Grumman Corp. and European Aeronautic Defence and Space Co., the parent of Airbus, over a competing bid by Boeing Corp., the incumbent. But the award set off a storm of protest from U.S. lawmakers, who wanted the contract awarded to U.S.-based Boeing -- apparently whether it offered the best bid or not. Boeing protested the award to its biggest competitor, and the U.S. Government Accountability Office decided last month that the original contract contained "significant errors" and should be rebid. The GAO said Boeing might have won the contract had it not been for the errors. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said his office, not the Air Force, would oversee the rebidding process. The contract is one of the largest ever awarded by the Air Force, and is the first of three similar deals expected to be worth more than $100 billion to replace some 600 refueling air tankers.

Climate changes at climate talks
The willingness of the world's richest industrialized nations to adopt greenhouse gas reduction targets has to be seen as a big improvement, even if the actual proposed cutbacks are not too large and not too fast. Hopefully, this is only the beginning. The agreement reached Tuesday by G-8 leaders to cut greenhouse gas emissions by half in the next 40 years. China, India and four other fast-growing nations, the source of much of the new pollution, are expected to join the talks Wednesday. While the agreement, which lacks some vital details, was praised by the richest nations, it was panned by environmentalists, who called it inadequate. But U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said such an agreement was mandatory because time was running out for stopping global warming. Leaders must draft a new treaty to succeed the first phase of the Kyoto Protocol, which expires in 2012. The United States has refused to ratify Kyoto.

Britain backs Zimbabwe sanctions
Former colonial power Great Britain endorsed the United States' call for tougher sanctions on Zimbabwe following last month's re-election of Robert Mugabe in an election marred by violence and fraud. British Foreign Secretary David Miliband said Sunday that South Africa and other nations should join an international campaign to place restrictions on Zimbabwe in light of the Mugabe government's conduct during the campaign, according to the Associated Press. Miliband apparently singled out South Africa because its leader, Thabo Mbeki, has had the responsibility of mediating Zimbabwe's political crisis on behalf of a regional African agency. Zimbabwe opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai, who withdrew from the balloting because of violence against his supporters, and complained to other countries after the first round of voting in March, accuses Mbeki of favoring Mugabe. International observers agreed the runoff was not fair. Tsvangirai won the March balloting with 48 percent of the vote, not enough to avoid a runoff, after a vote count that took five weeks. Sanctions proposed by the United States would require countries to freeze the assets of Mugabe and 11 Zimbabwe officials, and restrict their travel out of the country. "There has got to be a clear mix of diplomacy and sanctions," Miliband said, according to the AP. Mbeki made an unannounced visit to Zimbabwe yesterday to meet with Mugabe and Arthur Mutambara, leader in Tsvangirai's party, but not with Tsvangirai.

False alarm on China-Tibet talks
Word from the recent negotiations in Beijing is that China's offers to talk with the Dalai Lama appear to have been disingenuous. One of the envoys told the Reuters international news service Saturday that the Chinese negotiators showed "an absence of serious and sincere commitment" to resolving the long-simmering dispute between China and Tibet. Envoy Lodi Gyari said the Chinese negotiators wanted only to disparage the Dalai Lama, who fled Tibet when China took over in 1959 and has been in exile in India ever since, and did not discuss the welfare of Tibet or its people. "We were compelled to candidly convey to our counterparts that in the absence of serious and sincere commitment on their part, the continuation of the present dialogue process would serve no purpose," Gyari said. China agreed to convene the talks, the second meeting with the Dalai Lama's representatives since Chinese troops cracked down on protests in Tibet earlier this year, in response to international pressure concerning the 2008 Olympics, scheduled to begin next month in Beijing. Some Western leaders had threatened to boycott the opening ceremonies, but most have since said they will attend, including President Bush.

Security Council to vote next week on Zimbabwe sanctions
The United States said today it expects the U.N. Security Council to vote next week on new sanctions against the rulers of Zimbabwe, where longtime president Robert Mugabe was re-elected in a disputed election. U.S. Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad said he submitted a formal proposal for asset freezes and travel bans on Mugabe and 11 members of his government, and for an embargo on arms sales to Zimbabwe, according to the Reuters international news service. "We expect a vote on the resolution sometime next week," Khalilzad said, according to Reuters. Mugabe was re-elected in a June 27 run-off after a campaign marked by violence against supporters of opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai, who pulled out of the voting because of the attacks. Western nations have been pressuring Mugabe to negotiate, but the opposition Movement for Democratic Change has rejected calls for a unity government like the one installed in Kenya. Tsvangirai won the first round of voting in March. Security Council members South Africa, Russia and China are against sanctions, Reuters said. Russia and China are among the five nations with veto power on the 15-nation council.

Rebels on the ropes in Colombia
Today's rescue of 15 hostages held by leftist anti-government rebels in the jungles of Colombia could signal the beginning of the end for the 44-year-old insurgency. Former presidential candidate Ingrid Betancourt, who had been held kidnapped during the 2002 campaign and held for six years, and three U.S. military contractors who had been held for more than five years were among the rescued hostages, according to the Associated Press. Colombia's defense minister said the hostages were rescued without a fight when spies tricked the guerrillas from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) into letting them go. Analysts regard the rescue as worst defeat ever in FARC's decades-long insurgency, which had recently seen many of its top commanders killed by government forces. The three Americans -- Marc Gonsalves, Thomas Howes and Keith Stansell -- who worked for a Northrup Grumman Corp. subsidiary under contract to the Pentagon -- were the longest-held American hostages in the world. FARC had long resisted efforts to free the hostages. Recent efforts included entreaties from Venezuela's anti-U.S. president, Hugo Chavez.

Notaphilists seem to collect according to strict rules. The banknotes have to conform to specific wants: Reference, Country, Denomination, Issued Banknote, Grade, Price…etc. In other words it ‘Ticks all the boxes’.
The banknote with all the ticks has gone through a rigorous process to end up as a final circulating banknote and subsequently to end up with a collector. The process would have consisted of: Idea, Sketch, Artwork, Pasteup, Engraving, Trials, Proofs, and so on, all executed by skilled craftsmen. In the future, maybe it’s already here, CAD (Computer Aided Design) will take all the earlier processes away, removing most of the human element from production. Leaving the approval of a final design, printing and ultimately placement of the banknote into circulation.
At some point an artist was given a brief to design a set of banknotes by world region not by country. Various ideas would have been worked up with nonsensical wording to fill the headings. The preparation for these designs would have taken careful consideration of the minutest detail, being careful not to offend anyone politically or religiously in anyway. Can anyone prove these designs led to a final issued banknote? Does it matter? Not ticking all the boxes, having an open mind, being aware that collecting banknotes can be extended to beyond a catalogue reference number. All or any of these enhance our unique hobby.
The twelve surviving preliminary sketches recorded in this article are from a De La Rue artist’s effects. All are undated but must have been created in the late 1950s. Other related artwork obtained at the time relates to this era. Each sketch would have taken a skilled artist two or three days to complete. I suspect they were commissioned by the Design Department at De La Rue, possibly as speculative work to fill down time in slack periods or work for the ‘stock books’. The ‘stock books’ would have been full of artwork, complete and part designs, to show prospective clients who could choose elements to be worked up into preliminary pasteups. A high percentage of the De La Rue ‘stock books’ were disposed of in the late 1990s. One reason for the disposal being the move in 1999 from Basingstoke, Hampshire (De La Rue H.Q.) to Overton, Hampshire (Portals H.Q.), there being less storage space for the archive at Overton. De La Rue had obtained Portals and asset stripped the company, selling off the Manor House, tithe cottages and river - the heritage of Henri de Portal’s and his ‘family’. Thus creating a bad working environment for the incoming workforce. Ironically, the Design Department moved back to Basingstoke in 2009.
Accepted pasteups pass to a General Engraver who works on the basic banknote features. Then a succession of artists would work on their specialist area: Vignette Engraver, Lettering Engraver, Plant Engraver, Machine Engine Turning for borders and backgrounds and the most important of all, the Portrait Engraver.
All sketches are on thin card 263mm x 174mm, have numerous annotations relating to native patterns used, colours, border designs, heading text and plants and artefacts from the region depicted. The sketches themselves are 150mm x 65mm.
Thanks must go to retired De La Rue staff for their input.
